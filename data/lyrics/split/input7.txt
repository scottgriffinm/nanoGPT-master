he locker room . .  . Legendary Baby

[Verse 1]
I was just a snotty nose degenerate with fake pass perfection
Dodging teachers out to give my late ass detention
Hardly a heart throb but I made do
Using them same circle yes or no notes I used in grade school
Folded love letters with the tab that read pull here
Writing back and forth in notebooks for a full year
I use to day dream about Miss Maglassin
A type of fantasy you kind of feel guilty for having but who hasn't
The only difference besides the age is that I acted on it
And who wouldn't
A school boys crush a mature womans lust
And they hit it off so well
And I could tell the day she asked me to stay after class that it was all bad
But I just bit my lip and acted all mad
The bell rang
Class dismissed the door shut and her skirt went up
That's a rap

[Hook]
And I can hear 'em talking in the hallways
I'm always late for lunch learning dirty little leasons from you
Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school
Now I'm a legend in the locker room . .  . Legendary Baby

[Verse 2]
We gave a brand new meaning to after school special
The second that are lips touched
She kissed my ribs and counted each one out loud
I tried my hardest not to giggle but I couldn't cause it tickled so much
She pulled my pants to half mast
I said "Hurry Miss M you're gonna make me late for math class"
The way she praised my balls was vicious
That's what I like to call sack religious
1 time became 20 times
Before we knew it we stopped caring about where we were doing it
From the classroom to the bathroom
And when all the students were gone we'd even do it in the staff room
From Fs to As in less then 3 days
Now the under achiever's the one with the best grades
Had the third floor shaking without breaking a sweat
God damn it felt good to be the teacher's pet

[Hook]
And I can hear 'em talking in the hallways
I'm always late for lunch learning dirty little leasons from you
Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school
Now I'm a legend in the locker room . .  . Legendary Baby

[Verse 3]
Goodness gracious accusations started flying through the building
Cruel as school children
This isn't how its suppose to be
Reminiscent of Don't Stand So Close To Me
And it was mostly my fault for letting the shit happen
But I couldn't resist a little adolescent bragging . . I mean
After all I was only 15 and she was showing me things my virgin eyes had never seen
And I never forgot the little meeting she called
But when she saw my reaction it made her appalled
So, basically what your saying is if I don't keep tappin that ass
Then you ain't going to let me pass
Some punishment lady and as I turn toward the door I look back
She had her clothes on the floor
Needless to say I passed with flying colors
But my teacher was my best friend's mother, damn

[Hook]
And I can hear 'em talking in the hallways
I'm always late for lunch learning dirty little leasons from you
Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school
Now I'm a legend in the locker room . .  . Legendary Baby

[Verse One]
Now I could, sit here and baffle you with
Shallow babble and a, bunch of punch lines you probably won't get
Or even, use some big words that, you'd have to look up but
I'm not a teacher so go 'head and close your book up
I could, tell a fairy tale, so convincin
And keep a straight face from beginnin to happy endin
I could waste thirty-two bars tellin you how to live
Knowing damn well I used MTV Cribs for the blueprint
I could, bore you to death with, my past relationships
Or, a little ditty 'bout "Jack & Diane"
Or I could, go back to childhood, dig up them skeletons and
Spit 'em at you with a catchy hook look
I could, strike a nerve with some four letter words
That'll make Richard Pryor proud; or better yet
I could, sing a jingle that'll contort and mingle
Every single solitary letter in the alphabet

[Hook]
I could tell you whatever you want to hear
But if I just said hello would you listen to me?
I could sell a blind man new ears
If I just said hello would you listen to me?
I'm tryin hard to make it perfectly clear
But I'm dyin because there ain't nobody listenin to me
Been relyin on myself on myself for more than twenty-two years
And I ain't cryin I just need someone to listen to me
Breaker breaker can I get some reply, or maybe some kind of sign
To let me know that you're listenin to me?
Just from time to time, I get lost in my mind
It's hard to find someone to listen to me
My ears were open when you needed some consolin
Now I'm hopin to hear sounds besides echoes
Every time I say hello

[Verse Two]
I could talk about my duds and my thrift store scores
But that probably wouldn't interest you and, why should it?!
I mean, I've seen a lot of shit in twenty-two years
But your feet in my shoes is not somethin I recall
And I've been known to drink twenty-two beers
Before a show cause otherwise I probably wouldn't have the balls
I could, make references to books I never read
For the sake of sounding conscious but, that's just obnoxious
I could take off these bandages and, expose these papercuts
And put 'em in the air with both, my middle fingers up
Or talk about myself in third person like I'm better than you
Cause there's nothin else better to do
I could, attack your character from eighty different angles
Cleverly explainin exactly how wack you are, but
Why do that when it's a well known fact
You buyin this CD is potentially feedin me, c'mon

[Hook]

Hello... is there anybody out there? {*6X to fade*}

[Verse 1]
I knew this kid named Alberto
Funny style cat and his girl looked like a turtle
Not Lisa Turtle, just a turtle
High school track he ran the hurdle
His peers shed tears senior year when he got murdered
Now Alberto was your average A student
Participated in class, never came late and never truant
His family was picture perfect his older sister was prom queen
His dad a decorated vet for the Vietnam team
His mother was Dear Abby, an ordinary house wife
Like clockwork, always had dinner on the table at 5
But Alberto had a monster, he kept under his bed
And instead of lettin' it out, he just got a girlfriend instead
She knew something was funny, she could tell by his behavior
Or the way he flamboyantly shook his hand when he would wave to her
She thought nuttin' of it and just shoved it in the closet
Until the day the word dripped out like leaky faucet
Alberto was homosexual; I ain't have nothin' against it
But little Ronnie Johnson and all his football player friends did
They'd always pick and nag, call him fag and such and such
And couldn't wait to get to gym so they could really bust his nuts
The gym teacher never cared, he'd just join in on the action
He'd make silly gestures and compare him to Micheal Jackson
Alberto couldn't take it he just stopped showin' up
And whenever he walked them halls he just felt like throwin' up
And at night, he would cry and cry and ask "God why?"
Like "God, why in the fuck I had to be born this way?"
God would reply, "Son you gotta show 'em you're more than gay"
(Gotta show 'em you're more than gay..)
See he had dreams to be a track star
Until the warm April night them gay jokes went way too far
Ronnie begged for his forgiveness and invited him to a party
Cause his parents went away and left him plenty of Bacardi
Alberto kindly accepted, he was finally accepted
Except it was all deception and left him all unprotected
It was a plan Ronnie had scammed to get him in the right place
Verbally degrade him and rearrange his pretty face
The plan would go swiftly, they started callin' him sissy
One punch turned into fifty they beat him till he was dizzy
Now Alberto lie in blood while his peers look on in fear
He took his last breath and passed away his senior year
Needless to say it was one big tragedy
And how was Ronnie gonna explain it to his family
While they were on vacation takin' in sights
He got wasted and killed a kid that night

[Chorus]
Don't be a slave and behave the way they do
Just utilize the gifts that God gave you
Don't be a slave and behave the way they do
Just utilize the gifts that God gave you
Don't be a slave and behave the way they do
Just utilize the gifts that God gave you
Don't be a slave and behave the way they do
Just utilize the gifts that God gave you

[Verse 2]
I knew this girl named Maria, bright and talented
With aspirations to be a, big superstar
What a great idea, until she fell off
And started to listenin' to her peers - oh dear!
Now Maria was your typical obnoxious analytical
Headstrong rebel flippin' off the principal
Single mother home structure, she looked after baby brother
While moms worked two jobs just to buy supper
Pops was a strugglin' musician, troubled man
Jugglin' family and heroin addiction
He overdosed and left a notice of eviction
And, a crate of records on the table in the kitchen
And, a little angel with a keen sense of sound
Who saw solace in the records she found
And she would stay up late at night
Recitin' songs to herself under pale moonlight
Rightin' wrongs that her pops made
Promised her mom she would never go that same route, turns out
Carrie Anne had other plans
Her and her man Ronnie most popular, second best to nobody
Homecoming queen versus ugly duckling
And the story ends the same way
Okay Ronnie's parents went away for a couple of days
And told him no drinkin' - what the fuck was they thinkin'?
Maria was oblivious that her boyfriend had already been invited
So when Carrie Anne asked, she got all excited
Like "Damn, now I got somethin' to look forward to"
Or so she thought
Maria kindly accepted, she was finally accepted
Except it was all bullshit, now pay attention
Carrie Anne hated Maria cause she could sing
So she scored a bag of heroin, but the craziest thing
Was Maria never touched drugs, she did that night
And when her man was gettin beat she was nowhere in sight
Now her boyfriend lie in blood and she had no idea
Alberto passed away and she got hooked her senior year
Needless to say it was one big tragedy
And, I hate to break it but it doesn't end happily
A warm day in May, the sky was so beautiful
Carrie Anne died in a crash leavin the funeral
If I recall correctly
It was the middle of spring
Walkin with my boys
Contemplating what summer will bring
We started talkin about girls
And it was the funniest thing
As I started remembering some of my funniest flings

See there was ashley
She caught my eye the very second that she passed me
I kissed her once
Then she started to harass me
She called all night long
I had to buy a brand new phone

And let me see
There was Melanie
To have a mouth like that should be a felony
Wouldn't believe half the shit that she was tellin me
I mean dirty vocab
She used to talk like she was grown
And after that there was tiffany
The one with the cute cousin
Are you kiddin' me?
She had a man
But that didn't mean shit to me
He tried to catch us all the time
But I was just to god damn smooth

And I can't forget to mention Carrie
But that situation quickly got scary
Cuz after two days she's like 'let's get married'
Can you believe that shit?
I had to pack my bags and move!

(Chorus)
They say I gotta change my evil ways
And I'm workin hard at it every day but
No matter what I do
I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to
If love is just a game that people play
And practice make perfect is what they say
But no matter what I do
I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to

I'll always remember Monica
The Jewish chick
She'd always give me gifts for Hanukkah
To met her folks, she'd try and make me rock a yamaka
But she looked so damn good
She almost made my ass convert
And after that there was Lisa
You know she had a twin sister, Teresa
I bumped into them at Cam's gettin' pizza
The greatest night of my life
Schlep's the rock that kill two birds

And there was Erica
She had the stankest breath in North America
I tried to slip her tic-tacs
But they were scared of her
And when we made out
I always had to plug my nose

And I suppose you know your sister
Chill, I swear my hand to God
I only kissed her
I gotta foot fetish
But she gotta lota blisters
I mean, hammer-time feet
You think she had dead bugs for toes

(Chorus)
They say I gotta change my evil ways
And I'm workin hard at it every day but
No matter what I do
I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to
If love is just a game that people play
And practice make perfect is what they say
But no matter what I do
I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to
Yo Matt, remember Catherine?
She talked so much
I used to make her bring me aspirin
Blah, blah blah blah
I'm doin fine thanks for askin
I even tried to make a muzzle
But her mouth would just not quit

And oh shit
Remember Shawna
I hate to bring her up again
I didn't want her
That girl I talked about
In "That girl's a dog" song
Yea, the poster girl from paxil
Almost made me lose my grip

And oh shit
There was Krystal
The meth head
She used to sniff like a fist full
One time she chased me down the street with a pistol
She tried to say I took her stash
She bugged out and tried to kill my ass

And at last we got Kimmy
She went abroad
Came back
And broke up with me
And so I ripped up all them letters that she sent me
I cried for like 3 days
Then it was back to my evil ways

(Chorus)
They say I gotta change my evil ways
And I'm workin hard at it every day but
No matter what I do
I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to
If love is just a game that people play
And practice make perfect is what they say
But no matter what I do
I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to

(Chorus)
They say I gotta change my evil ways
And I'm workin hard at it every day but
No matter what I do
I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to
If love is just a game that people play
And practice make perfect is what they say
But no matter what I do
I seem to make the same mistakes that I'm tryin not to

[Intro: Patrick Stump]
Mbabarara, mbabarara
Mbabarara, mbabarara, mbabarara

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But Momma, I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend
And I know it sounds so old
But Cupid got me in a chokehold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towel's on the mat, my white flag is wavin' (Mbabarara)
I mean, she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka-Seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is
We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young, but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
It's been a while since we talked last
And I'm tryin' hard not to talk fast
But Dad, I'm finally thinkin' I may have found the one
Type of girl that'll make you way proud of your son
And I know you heard the last song
About the girls that didn't last long
But I promise this is on a whole new plane
I can tell by the way she says my name (Mbabarara)
I love it when she calls my phone
She's even got her very own ringtone
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is (Mbabarara)
It's gonna be a long drive home
But I know as soon as I arrive home
And I open the door, take off my coat, and throw my bag on the floor
She'll be back into my arms once more for sure like

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

[Bridge: Travie McCoy]
She's got a smile that'll make the most senile
Annoying old man bite his tongue (I'm not done)
She's got eyes comparable to sunrise
And it doesn't stop there (Man, I swear)
She's got porcelain skin, of course she's a ten
Now she's even got her own song (But movin' on)
She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard
And we can be on the phone for three hours (Not sayin' one word)
And I would still cherish every moment
And when I start to build my future, she's the main component
Call it dumb, call it luck, call it love
Or whatever you call it, but
Everywhere I go I keep her picture in my wallet like

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

[Intro/Hook]
She says she loves me but, she comes and goes when she pleases
When the door shuts, it's like another papercut
And I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aids
Until she comes back around like them ceilin fan blades
Claims she loves me but, she cuts me into pieces
When I'm sewed up, here comes another papercut
Now I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aids
Until she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades

[Verse One]
We met twenty-two years back, fresh out the womb
Now she consumes me, no room for self these days
And she's so demandin - do this, do that
Don't forget to take your medicine
I hate it when her face is invading my head again
The welcome mat reads "please take off your shoes"
But she disregards the statement
I've grown accustomed to bending my beliefs
To, satisfy her needs but I'm fed up
With plugging cuts everytime they bleed
So I dip my pen in the puddle
What a bloody mess its been tryin to end this struggle
But I love her, she's the reason for the lesions
Man I love her, I start bleeding when she's leavin
And every scar on my fingertip is a reminder of
All the lessons learned on my missions tryin to find her but
I'll sit alone 'til she comes back home
And I'll be waitin by the phone {*ring*} hello?

[Hook]
She says she loves me but, she comes and goes when she pleases
When the door shuts, it's like another papercut
And I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aids
Until she comes back around like them ceilin fan blades
Claims she loves me but, she cuts me into pieces
When I'm sewed up, here comes another papercut
Now I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aids
Until she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades

[Interlude]
She don't live here no more; I heard she's stayin down the street
With a deadbeat that don't treat her right with two bad-ass kids
Guilt and regret, and I'm willin to bet
My last album that she's wishin she was kissin me

[Verse Two]
Man the nerve of this bitch, pardon my French but it's been 10 days
And I'm gettin kind of lightheaded
Maybe I'll write her a letter, in a gentleman's way
And send it, with the hopes that she might get it
I can't believe I let her run all over me
But, all I think about is when she's here and holdin me
I love her, she's the reason for the lesions
Man I love her, I start bleeding when she's leavin
And every scar on my fingertip is a reminder of
All the lessons learned on my missions tryin to find her and
I can't complain, I kind of like the pain
She ain't even got a name she just lives in my brain and

[Hook]
She says she loves me but, she comes and goes when she pleases
When the door shuts, it's like another papercut
And I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aids
Until she comes back around like them ceilin fan blades
Claims she loves me but, she cuts me into pieces
When I'm sewed up, here comes another papercut
Now I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aids
Until she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades

[Outro]
Says she loves me but (she really thinks that I'm an asshlole)
She says she loves me but (my ears are too big)
She says she loves me but (I pick my nose too much)
She says she loves me but (she says I never really listen)
She says she loves me but (I take too many pills)
She says she loves me but (I never pay my bills)
She says she loves me but (I wait until the last minute)
She says she loves me but (I don't try hard enough)

[Verse 1]
I walk on decrepit bricks and kick sticks and rusty soda cans
Simply for lack of better stimulation
Motivation comes and goes like gas station patrons
So sedation compensates for unexpected vacations (thank you)
That's my pre-gratitude
Post-please leave me alone that's just my rude attitude
No dysfunction flipside, I'm just your ordinary citizen
They're waiting patiently for me to sin again, but then again (shit...)
I'm really mommy's little angel
But that angel on my shoulder got strangled
For trying to tangle with his nemesis he caught him on the wrong day
And got cut like DJs spinning doubles (let the fucking song play)
I'm on my way to the store ignoring the city
To purchase a pack of Marb' Reds with a stack of rolled pennies
I could go for Denny's, and my stomach holds plenty
But my pockets got holes, I guess the goal is to stay empty
Quite simply put: me and my pockets share interest
I'll never fall in love with that pretty green-eyed temptress, twice (yeah right)
I learned my lesson the first time
I just couldn't keep up with that ever-changing Jordan line of foot apparel
Parallel to many clones, my eye's vision monochromes
With seven shades and twenty tones
Plus I breath artistic, they eating everything I'm feeding them
Put myself in every painting and use my spit as mat medium
And results of my children, we share the same genes
Cast the same reflection and interpret the same dreams
Like whoa, like whoa, like whoa, like whoa (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)

[Chorus]
And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (Absolutely no purpose)
Feeling like I'm worthless (Feeling like I'm worthless)
But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
Content with the fact that I know this city's mine
And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (Absolutely no purpose)
Feeling like I'm worthless (Feeling like I'm worthless)
But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
Content with the fact that I know this city's mine

[Verse 2]
I walk down dead end streets like I didn't see the sign
Just to turn around and walk back
That's fine and dandy, but what's whack is the fact I'm still walking
Like "Thank God for walkmans."
I'm only yawning cause these simply minded mortals make me sleepy
So what do I do? I resort to T.V
In the seemingly lousy attempt to numb myself with lackluster images
And insignificant information like "Willis was really Ty Bridges"
Just to have the upper hand in monotonous conversations
And for lack of better stimulation
I'm painting portraits of dysfunctional families with gloomy faces
Rockin' "Don't Worry, Be Happy" t-shirts, and you're assuming I'm tasteless?
You misconstrue it but your babies will embrace it
The basic essentials of a very bitter young man
That kicks rusty soda cans and walks on decrepit bricks
With a permanent pair of headphones trying to make these lectures stick
I'll let the protestors picket, like they are gonna make a difference
And watch them die before they realize that their cause was nonexistent
Like their cause was nonexistent..

[Chorus]
And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (Absolutely no purpose)
Feeling like I'm worthless (Feeling like I'm worthless)
But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
Content with the fact that I know this city's mine
And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (Absolutely no purpose)
Feeling like I'm worthless (Feeling like I'm worthless)
But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
Content with the fact that I know this city's mine

[Verse 3]
I walk on shitty city sidewalks stepping on every single crack
Reminiscent of that joke we used to say when we were snotty nose
My purpose got defeated when my mind turned paraplegic
Plus I failed my civil service exam, they said I cheated
Not to mention tainted urine samples and the attention span of a second-grader
More fascinated with building blocks than wasting time stressing his daily lesson
Hence the ridilin, I've been gone with the wind like lucky lottery tickets since day one (one)
I stepped on the left cause right's wrong (wrong)
So what do I do? I resort to friendly games of ping pong and sing a song in "Sixpence"
I'm "None the Richer", I just kiss her on the lips and keep trucking

[Chorus]
And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (Absolutely no purpose)
Feeling like I'm worthless (Feeling like I'm worthless)
But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
Content with the fact that I know this city's mine
And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose (Absolutely no purpose)
Feeling like I'm worthless (Feeling like I'm worthless)
But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
Content with the fact that I know this city's mine

[Schleprock]
I took Cutie for a ride in my Death Cab
She tipped me with a kiss, I dropped her off at the Meth Lab
Before she left, she made a Dashboard Confessional
Then spilled her guts in Cursive, but what's worse
Is I could still see her Bright Eyes like Sunny Day Real Estate
Oh my, and the funny way the ceiling tastes x
So high, but no chance
My little Chemical Romance, left a bad taste in my mouth
But I approached her like, Hey Mercedes, why the long face?
Why you cryin, no need, just put on this Coheed, and Fall Out
Boy meets Girl, Jimmy Eat World
But Schlep eats pills 'til he's all out
Not once, not twice, she was Thrice times a lady
Actin all Brand New, but I had to
Bounce to the Postal Services to
Pick up these pills that take care of my nervousness
And, on the way, I saw Planes and Mistook 'em for Stars
She played games, but she took 'em too far
At the Drive-in, watchin' soft porn and you could tell
By the Trail of the Dead that there was something in the popcorn
Hop in my cab, destination Midtown
Just to get up with some kids that like to get down
I made my rounds and that was that
In between the frowns and scraps and heartattacks
And I remember
I seen her ass Early November
On a Thursday, Taking back Sunday for a refund
She shot a wink, like No Hard Feelings
Then she Jetted to Brazil, man, them pills had me spun
Yeah, this The Story of the Year right here
This is Hot Water Music
Cook your Ramens to it
Whattup Elliott I ain't seen you in a minute
How you doin?

[Verse One]
I'm like nine minutes away from finishing my nine hour shift
And wishin I was gone nine hours ago
Cause nine hours wasted, tossin back of this chicken
I coulda written nine verses just in time for the show
Slacker mindstate livin on time that's borrowed
My motto's I'll stop procrastinatin tomorrow
I took the sorrow from the windchimes, left happiness lonesome
And strung up sarcasm to make the melody wholesome
From my lungs to my feet, I'm breathin everything I speak
And now they chargin for oxygen and the bill's due next week
I'll be a day late and a buck short, story of my life
I wish my pay rate was much more, duckin swords in the rat race
I didn't apply for runnin towards something that's fake
And thinkin, why for? They shuttin doors right in my face
And sittin high horse is a car and a dope place
Somethin to die for, this is my war, so

[Hook]
Now I'm schemin on plots to make my pockets swell
Simple livin is a bitch but damn, I do it well
Some are fortunate to make it and, some of 'em fail
Some locomotives push through and some of 'em get derailed
Schemin on plots - HEY, HEY
Simple livin is a bitch - HEY, HEY
Some are fortunate to make it - HEY, HEY
Some locomotors push through - HEY, HEY

[Verse Two]
I lead a crocodile mile lifestyle, I run and slide
But when it's time to collide with the bump, I always bail
Cause I'm not ready for that dive or that silly nine to five
Solidified career option, a hop skip and a leap
Away from rock star, and not too far away from fillin pop's shoes
The idyllic hard workin type of calloused hands
Complete with wife, kids, dog, house, and picket fence, that's nonsense
I'm convinced I'm built for better things
And won't settle for the empty smile that cheddar brings
It seems like I'm workin hard simply cause it's what they say I have to do
You graduate and then you either get a job, or you go to school
12 years wasn't enough?
That's more than half of my life spent tryin to make the world accept me
Plus I've got the papers saying that I made it through
Now I'm working 2 jobs, 3 with music and you don't respect me?
Fuck it I'll retire now, you'll work until you're 62, and

[Hook]

If he were recording
If he were recording right now
Then he would be getting all this at the start
My track - yo we should have a freestyle on this
Freestyle? Hit 'em off with something
Spit a verse Travis, spit a verse
Quit picking your nose, and come off
Quit picking your nose? Fuck you

[Freestyle]
Traded in my, hollow words for jelly-filled verbs
And five pound pronouns and predicates
This is Schlep's etiquette for sloppy fable manners get your napkins
Matty Duke kick the beat, and I'm rappin'
Top of the line, top of the world, top of the mornin' to ya top dawg
That's a top notch tie you got, tie it in a knot
'Til your eyeballs pop out
So you can actually see what an actual MC looks like
And if I had to pick and choose
I'd be the indecisive dick in the votin' booth
Laughin' at my options, like
Stop the press and warn the media
Schlep Rock is leavin' ya, walkin' with prosthetic concoctions
I thought I told you, you just a toadstool
I'm Mario with firepower, stickin' dick to the Princess
It's just senseless, like that David and Goliath drama
Minus the slingin' stones, you're basically defenseless
Anyway you wanted Schlep Rock's cock obnoxious
It feels like a midget is chillin' in my boxers

[Outro]
What?
What?
Oh god
I'm sorry
Oh man
I don't know about that

[Verse 1]
Travis been known to spit lyrical backflips on tracks with skate kicks
Osiris had the flyest but I'm all about Axion, Verbal bigspin
I Crooked grind your melon for not listenin'
I'm beyond regular, you stuck in fakie position
The funny thing is I don't skate but I'll deflate your whole ego
Manipulate your face and replace it with something uglier than
The product of Sha-nae-nae and Patrick Ewing havin' a baby
(Damn Travis you crazy) Nah just a little misunderstood
I got the planet in confusion
For the simple fact my vocabulary lacks the word losin'
Contusions are placed across the bodies of any challengers
I'll leave my mark then disappear like J.D. Salinger
As whack emcee's continue scuffin' their knees
Suckin' the dicks of A&R's just to get their platinum chains and cars
I'mma keep on doin' my thing
Broke as Macy Gray would be with a regular voice trying to sing
Who wanna bring it to these Crab Apple affiliates
Act silly and you'll get split down the middle like a Philly gets
I've had enough of all these silent menaces
I'm for peace but you'll get quickly deceased with violent sentences
The only witnesses will be later notified to come identify the dental
Records of a kid offended mine
You ain't a friend of mine so I suggest you call me Mr. McCoy
Hot shit will burn and blister you boy
It's like...

[Hook]
We manifest through tape decks and Prismacolor markers
Invade your space like feathers from down parka's
We legends in our own times and every rhyme is living proof
We drinkin' forty's from the fountain of youth
And when we done we're pissin' innocence, cause in a sense
Everything your mouth dispense don't necessarily pay the rent
Or the phone bills, you can't trade food for mic skills
But if you could I'd be eating lovely, believe me

[Verse 2]
Travis McCoy be like the influenza, flow sick
These other rappers on some old common cold (SHHH)
I'm sicker than that, and plus you always suck (YECK) quicker than that
And H20 aqua we be thicker than that, and if at
Anytime shit gets to hard to handle I'm going out raw
Chainsaw and all like Bruce Cambell
Steppin' out the darkness with an army of creeps
Caffeine ain't allowin' Travis to get no sleep
Cause cat's speak soft, and quick to front hard like Charles Bronson
Shoutin' out Brooklyn, knowin' that they from Wisconsin
That's why I'm always concentratin' when I'm puffin' cheeba
We down with New York State and the city of Geneva
G-Town's my residence that's where I stack my dead presidents
And in my mind it ain't no time for irrelevance
Come on now I thought you knew better
My rhymes are nines and my mouth's a lyrical berretta
But better...YET...I make you Sweat like Keith
And have your whole crew fallin' out like rotten teeth
Have your whole damn crew fallin' out like rotten teeth, come on

[Hook]
We manifest through tape decks and prisma colored markers
Invade your space like feathers from down parka's
We legends in our own times and every rhyme is living proof
We drinkin' forty's from the fountain of youth
And when we done we're pissin' innocence, cause in a sense
Everything your mouth dispense don't necessarily pay the rent
Or the phone bills, you can't trade food for mic skills
But if you could I'd be eating lovely, believe me

[Bridge]
Who start it like us, rip a part it like us
Who you know jump on the stage and get retarded like us?
Who start it like us, rip a part it like us
Who you know jump on the stage and get retarded like us?
Who start it like us, rip a part it like us
Who you know jump on the stage and get retarded like us?
Who start it like us, rip a part it like us
Who you know jump on the stage and get retarded like us?

[Verse 3]
GCH will make it happen regardless of the element
From breakdancing, beats, graffiti shit, to straight rappin'
Who got your mama's hands cl-cl-cl-cl-clappin'?
Zappin' cats like the third rail
These rappers soundin' sweet over stale ass beats
Come on get serious
You're making me furious with these lame cliche's and whack hooks
Oh you ain't feelin' me? I'll beat you to death with black books
Now that I got your undivided, you got a mic? You better hide it
I'm creepin' six deep with seven swords of drunk pirates
With eye patches, no teeth and burnt eye lashes
So they don't sleep and stay dodgin' car crashes
I'll smash your pride like a star that just got his fame stolen
Bash you with a mic so hard I'll leave your name swollen
Cut to the chase I'll just get to the point first, cause frankly
You're shit is worse than Fred Durst's best verse
AND(AND)IT'S(IT'S)LIKE(LIKE)THAT(THAT)

[Hook]
We manifest through tape decks and prisma colored markers
Invade your space like feathers from down parka's
We legends in our own times and every rhyme is living proof
We drinkin' forty's from the fountain of youth
And when we done we're pissin' innocence, cause in a sense
Everything your mouth dispense don't necessarily pay the rent
Or the phone bills, you can't trade food for mic skills
But if you could I'd be eating lovely, believe me
Today I wasn't even gonna take a shower
And then I got a call sayin that my cousin died in a fire
So I washed myself for what seemed like three hours
With tears and rusty water
I need some of that Calgon take me away action immediately
Before I start scrubbing my hands hard repeatedly
I'm stuck somewhere lethargic between reality
And a fuckin Tool video - WAKE ME UP!
I've said goodbye too many times in these 22 long ones
And here I am wavin again; so long friend
I should have told her how this town doesn't like it when people leave
So it finds ways to keep them
It sows seeds and reaps them
And now she's part of that harvest, but different from all the others
Ask her mother how her smile touched souls and warmed cold hearts
Monique I miss you
I wish I could've kissed you farewell
And given you that tattoo you always asked for
But when I'm done tattin Thug Life on God's stomach
You got next; I'm done, y'all take what you want from it
I'm goin to wash my hands
I miss you girl

[Verse One]
Now who you know leave the scene messier than canvases
By Jackson Pollock throwin multicolored thoughts at a rapid pace
I'll, make a mess you dissect it and make sense of it
Then get back to me, at your earliest convenience
Check my verbal sequence, as I texturize these tracks
Seven layers to be exact, eliminate the wack
With a firm brush stroke, I MC paintily
Lyricists begin crumblin, from my scumblin technique
As I tweak your audio and visual
Keep my drips minimal, messages subliminal
Cause me and rap go way back, we compliment
So together we enhance one another that's common sense
High intensity catches the eye, your jaw drops
Be a real critic, not explicit with false props
I keep my thoughts deep my lights bright, I'm very thorough
With my chiaroscuro inspiration sparkin the knife
Now watch me rock the spot like Basquiat, minus the heroin
And make my face popular like Andy did to Marilyn
It's kinda scary when, real art gets left behind
While they take bullshit, and start sellin it to blind folks
But, I remain humble
As long as Grayskul continues spinnin hot shit
On his twin twelve-hundred color wheels of steel
Fuck mass appeal, art is art
Only the real can truly feel it
So, open your eyes and listen, combine your ears with vision
Or do it cause you love it or for cash that's your decision
That's your decision, that's your decision

[Verse Two]
Its like I'm torn between two worlds, a paintbrush and a microphone
A canvas or a beat, CD or LP
Anything goes when my ink pen flows
And God only knows where it's gonna bring me next, so
I'm inclined to like paint rhymes
And spit kaleidoscopes, with one eye closed
And I suppose if you chose the path that I chose
You know the cycle asshole don't front
It goes, inspiration and productivity
Then, a sense of self-worth and in steps depression
Like back and forth, and forth and back
Should I, paint a picture or record a track
A gift or a curse; I don't know I'm still undecided
But, over the years I've found clever ways to hide it
And those that lack the passion I have may despise it
But my momma made me this way, I thank her everyday
So tell them kids to keep colorin outside the lines
Until they lose they limitations and they minds is free
Tell the teachers that you want your money back this time
And tell Bob Ross thanks for all the happy little trees
And tell my momma that her baby boy's doin just fine
Although he's runnin out of patience but his mind is free
And tell my pops that I'll pay his money back sometime
And that his son is two steps away from where he needs to be

[Chorus: Patrick Stump (Travis McCoy)]
We have to take our clothes off (so sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no, no, no, no

[Travis McCoy]
Excuse me miss, I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are
I dig your attitude and how you're acting like you own the bar
Got me flashing keys and I don't even own a car
Front like you ain't feeling my charm, because I know you are
I'm trying to see how your lips feel
Oh I'm sorry, my name is Travey and I'm pretty much a big deal
Oh, you've never heard of me, that sounds absurd to me
The way you stole my attention was flat out burglary
What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can
Possibly reconvene and play some naked peek-a-boo
Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through
And it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too
I'm such an angel with a devilish angle
And quite the certified sweet talker
And you're buying every line of it girl
And I don't really blame you
If I was in your shoes I'd probably do the same too

[Chorus w/Reef the Lost Cauze ad-libs]

[Reef the Lost Cauze]
I went from ashey to classy, now they ask me
Ig they can have me, in the back seat
Of the Caddy, callin me daddy, smackin the phatty
Ghost and Travey, pass the hashies
Damn ma, them denims look tight
I'm into sex, any sex, I need you tonight
Cuz I'm not sleepin, and nah, I'm not creepin
No wife, no kids boo, you can stay the weekend
No pajamas, nothin to sleep in
Seems shallow, so jump in the deep end
Why go out baby, we can eat in
I don't discriminate color, there's no reason
You can be Black, Asian, Puerto Rican
German, Indian, Scicilian, Norweigan
No matter your region or click you be in
Straight from the hood, or a cracka like wheat thins

[Chorus]

[Hook: Travis McCoy X2]
Travis got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie-rock chicks and hip-hop chicks
Thin chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks

[ODB Sample]
Ghostface Killaaaaaaah

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo, whatup gorgeous, it's Toney, I seen you from affar
With that milkshake, bringin all the boys to the yard
Had to scoop you, like hey, take a look at my girlfriend
Hourgalss figure with your hair and your curls in
Sexy, down just to party all night
But you gotta take your clothes off just to make it right
Have a good time, good chance you can be mine
Like sixty eight, I only want a percent of your time
But I'm good for it love, the bank got crazy os
Catch me on tour with them Gym Class Heroes
You said, "Wait you Ghostface from the Wu-Tang Clan?
Where your boys at, my girl's dying to meet RZA man"
I laughed, ordered a chill bottle of Goose
You can get loose, I'll call the troops
Now we pulling out the Bentlies and six hundred Coups
But you gotta promise to get down to your birthday suit

[Chorus X2]

[Hook X2]

[Verse 1 - Travis]
All press is good press kids
So if you wanna see us gone
Then I suggest you keep our name out of your headlines
Unless you wanna mess that is
Your best bet is to set your dirty laundry separate from the clean before your deadline
Admit it you wanted to be an artist
But your parents and that tiny voice inside you said it wasn't worth the hardships
What better way to compensate then to hate on everything you wish you were
But didn't have the balls to harness
Pop culture's my trip, somehow you think your gonna stop us
Cuz you flirted with a chick who's got my tongue in her esophagus
Bitches post anonymous
We shat on 07, 08 is gonna be great imagine 2011
Give me one good reason I shouldn't dead this debate
Don't worry I'll wait....
That's the fuck I thought
Cat got your tongue
Next time get your facts right
Google me and act right

[Hook - Dre]
How can I be with...
Be without your hate
It gives me peace of mind
So please don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
It's your hate that keeps me believing
That we're the greatest of all time
So please don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over

[Bridge - Dre]
Don't tell me it's over
Because I can't bare to see you go
See you go
Don't tell me it's over
Because I can't bare to see you go
See you go

[Verse 2 - Travis]
Hey Mr. Internet
To whom it may piss off, yea you and you
Here's a list of shit you didn't know but now you do
Exploit my bad habits
Tell them I do drugs
Tell them Travis smokes more crack than Tyrone Biggums does
Tell them I can't rap
Tell them I dumb it down
Tell them not to buy tickets whenever my band's in town
Tell them I sold out, say I did it for the fame
And how I buy magazines for the sake of seeing my name
Tell them I how frequent parties trying to get that page 6
Tell them so and so someone saw pictures of my dick
Make me out to be an asshole that don't deserve his fans
Make me more insecure than I already am
Kick dirt on my accomplishments if you're ever bored
Just document it well and don't forget to hit record
One hit wonder my ass, what are you talking about
Let them keep bogging trash im gonna take the garbage out

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 1: Ice-T]
E-V-I-L E and Ice-T are on a jack move
Layin down the dope groove, smokin those who disapprove
Wreckin the deck, you'll regret if you cross punk
Rollin like a Mack truck, waxin those who talk junk
Dialing you in, I got your face in my crosshairs
Wanna see your dome bust sucker cause I don't care
Nuttin bout you, your crew, because you talk shit
I'm the Lethal Weapon boy, ridin the apocalypse
If you're in my way, then lay beneath the ground soon
Violence is my business fool, the microphone of doom
Mission that's to cure all punks as I bust caps
Peelin your back, my ammunition hollow-point raps
You try to run, that makes it even more fun
I just cold lamp and vamp you with the shotgun
Cops try to flex.. but guns they'll never find..
My Lethal Weapon's my mind!

[Chorus: Rakim]
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin

[Verse 2: Ice-T]
You hit the deck, as rap busts from my lips
You think I'm finished - I load another clip
Look in my face, I crack an evil grin
Lyrics bring death from the microphone Mac-10
Sucker MC's, you ain't down with the Syndicate
Try to kick game, but end up talkin weak shit, yo
You're weak, you're wack, you need to quit you lil punk bitch
Go and freak your mother, go dig a damn ditch
Get out my face, I'm tired of the press too
You write about me, I write about you
You think I'm violent, but listen and you will find..
My Lethal Weapon's my mind!

[Chorus: Rakim]
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin

[Verse 3: Ice-T]
Up against the wall - it's Valentine's Day
The Massacre's about due for a replay
I'm about to explode - like a hand grenade
Evil E do damage on the crossfade
{*Evil E scratches*} Cuts like a battleaxe
You try to bite, get iced, my raps are boobytraps
Claim of mine, designed by the Ice himself
You beg for mercy as you read the hand you're dealt
{*screaming "Ah ahh ahh AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!"*}
Cause there's no let up, you walked into a set up
It's suckin you down and now you can't get up
Why because you froze the moment we met up
And I never run punk, I go head up
I ain't no fool and new jack poppin fake rap
I rap from the heart and soul, where only facts are kept
Many rappers sell-out pop and other MC's slept
I ain't in no playin mood, so nigga watch your step
Cause if you cross the boss, you go to bed quick
Know my situation boy, don't diss the Syndicate
Cause when we chose to move, you're gone
And no remains they'll find..
My Lethal Weapon's my mind!

[Chorus: Rakim]
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin

[Verse 4: Ice-T]
More bodies than John Gotti, the Lethal Weapon is slaying
Just open any book, that's ammo to the brain
What really matters, is how well is your weapon trained
Some would say genius, while others would say insane
The Weapon power has been witnessed upon many pages
From Martin Luther's "dream", to Hitler's psycho rage
What's more powerful - the brain or a twelve gauge?
The words I speak have scared many people to this stage
But promote violence, I really have to disagree
It's entertainment, like "Terminator" on TV
But some'll never see, you're stupid ignorant and blind
The Lethal Weapon's the mind!

[Chorus: Rakim]
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin

[Ice-T]
The mind..
Think!

The mind..
YouknowhatI'msayin?
I got my jammy with me at all times, youknowhatI'msayin?
They can't take this one thing away from me
That's got more power, than any gun in the world, youknowhatI'msayin?
I'm talkin bout brain power homeboy
They can't mess with me cause I'm too smart for them out there
YouknowhatI'msayin? Fully strapped, always packed
Go to the library and get some more ammo, youknowhatI'msayin?
Yo yo whassup Ice man you look upset brother
Yo man, I got a lot of things on my mind man
But I don't know if I should put it on this record, yaknahmsayin?
Man go ahead and kick it man
Let the people know what's happenin man
You know brothers out there sellin out man
Why they goin out like that man?
Yo, sellin out like it ain't nothin man
I ain't with it

[Ice-T]
Dig it, I'm just a brother from L.A
South Central, I live life the fly way
Used to bang and hustle but I traded for the big game
Infamy got dumped for fame
Now I'm known and respect as creator of the crime rhyme;
But my lyrics are deeper
Because I'm the one that makes you think before make a move
I wrote "Pusher", "High Rollers", and "Colors" just to prove
That I could kick game, and drop knowledge at the same time
But one L.A. station wouldn't play my records one time
I'm tryin to save my community
But these bourgeoise blacks keep on doggin me
They don't care about violence, drugs and gangs
KJLH, you ain't about nuttin
You just a bunch of punk bourgeoise black suckers
And this one's for me
You won't play no Public Enemy
You ain't playin no Boogie Down Productions
You ain't tryin to represent the black community
You just carin about your little ol' R&B +BULL+
You play all day and night
I represent Los Angeles all over the United States
And you ain't did NUTTIN for me
Think about it

Hold up, I ain't finished on the diss tip
There's a few more punks that I got to rip
All you chump MC's who sell out quick
When P.E. was on the top, you rode the tip
But now they got problems and you suckers run
Who's Chuck's real friends, does he really have one?
You yell P.E. this, P.E. that
Fist in the air, proud to be black
Now they got static and you run like punks
I haven't heard an MC stand up for him once
Maybe you suckers are just hopin that they fall off
So you can fill their shoes, nope sorry boss
That's what the matter with black people anyway
We ain't down with nothin, I don't care what you say
Yell or lie, don't even bother
How low will a brother go for a dollar?
Public Enemy broke a new rap age
And now you rappers ain't got nuttin to say?
"Yo it's their problem" "Griff shouldn'ta said it"
E where's my pistol? (Yo I'll go get it)
Cause it's time for me to enforce some discipline
Are you down or not, are you out or in?
Chuck Flav and Griff are my true friends
I got their backs if it means my career ends
All you so-called down MC's with Public Enemy
I ain't heard nobody out there, tryin to help my man out
YouknowhatI'msayin? Griff is my man, I don't care WHAT he said
YouknowhatI'msayin? And I ain't gon' let them go out like that
YouknowhatI'msayin? Chuck, Ice got your back
Anybody out there got problems with Public Enemy, come talk to me

Once again, I'm back in the diss mode
I gotta speak my mind, it's time to unload
On this so-called government we've got
If I lied like them, I think I'd get shot
They sell drugs to kids and say it's us
And when the cops are crooks, who can you trust?
You only see young brothers in a drug bust
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust
My homey got a year for an ounce of weed
While Bush sells weapons to the enemy
You gotta be stone blind not to see
"Our government is honest!" Nigga, please
Cocaine can't be made in the United States
Kickin facts like this our government hates
The young kids on the streets ain't the enemy
They're just ghetto youth after money
They sell drugs, but who sells drugs to them?
Try the C.I.A. my friend
Or the F.B.I. or even Bush
Somebody's gettin rich, damn sure ain't us
We're just killin ourselves while others laugh
Look at the street, it's a cocaine bloodbath
We gotta realize dope is pure death
Mess with drugs, you're breathin your last breath
Sellin drugs is straight up genocide
They're gonna laugh, while we all die
Sittin up there thinkin you're makin that money
Hustlin and all that, you're killin your brothers
YouknowhatI'msayin? You just stupid, straight up stupid
Puttin dope into your body - c'mon, youknowhatI'msayin?
You gotta get somethin goin out there
Get some brains, youknowhatI'msayin?
We are just playin ourselves cold out of the pocket

This one's for me, I make records for you
But this cut I straight out had to do
There's topics in my mind I have to break
Cause so many of you out there are so damn fake
If ya ain't know they're no-one, cutthroats
Backstabbers, scheamin for banknotes
And all of you out there know what I'm talkin bout
If you claim you're down then NEVER sell-out
Never sell out, youknowhatI'msayin?
You gotta stay down for yours
You know I want it, sure as I'm Ice-T
I make records for you, but this one's for me

You know what I'm talkin bout out there
There's ways to sell out left and right
But you ain't got to do that
There's things more important than money
I'm talkin bout pride, I'm talkin bout dignity
You got it out there
All you got to do is stand on your own two feet
Don't go out like no sucker
Stay down, youknowhatI'msayin?
Peace

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Enough time has passed, false prophets steering you wrong
You won't appreciate my wisdom, 'til I'm dead and I'm gone
Underground dead from combat
Laid down on the floor.. in some club
Girls scream at the ocean of blood
No use to call the paramedics, to hit me with the fifth energetic
Close range, cut in the base of my brain
Blew my face on through some bitch's head, before I hit the ground
Some nigga touched me in the chest, and blew it out with the pound
My niggas didn't have chance to move, they used silenced weaponry
Couldn't hear the sound, as the club bass bound
All you heard was.. Yo, Ice is on the ground
The assassins, when they heard this up, stepped back and mixed in with the crowd
Gloom broke into hysteria, spot went wild
A lot of bitches yelling and crying, while fake niggas smile
I heard voices of my loved ones said I leave the party
God kisses my face as I leave my body

[Interlude: Deuce Fever]
Yo, I wanna see what the fuck's happening!
Yo, yo, back off my man, man! (*Sample of L.A.P.D. sirens*)
Awww shit! y'all

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]
The game is real, anyone can get touched up
Get moved on, left in a plunger blood
No matter how gangster you are, how deep your crew
Niggas can get you if they want to

[Verse Two: Mark Live]
Yo.. yo.. yo.. attack mode
Look, listen, it's the general.. code
Gully and gutter, I roll with some box cutters
I'm bringing.. fucking Jersey City niggas
We got.. tons of triggers, for tons of niggas
We walk and talk a lot, we run some niggas
No glitter and glades, it's guns and niggas
Nightclubs or your social clubs
Backstage with your membrane, on the side of your freeway
It's ugly, the bomb squashed blonde bitch for our shit
It's M-16s switch off clips
Bullets ripped fleshy death right through your kids
Except your bids, except all that shit you did
Uhh.. you can't hide in the town houses
When two niggas are nine-ing like two ounces
Scarface Colombia, Walker Tah's style surrounding, your white bitches out

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Now, if you faggots got some questions about how real this is
A straight Strong-Arm, half of you niggas in the biz'
Your bodyguard, bitch made, motherfucking fake ass whores
Can't even roll for dolo, walk through your own hood solo
Niggas push up and change-snatch your logo
The truth is.. no homeboys are brought through
Your own crew is destorying you
So now you're carrying guns, you know, you won't shoot
You copped a new whip, had to get a bulletproof
You wanted to be Rap-Star, now, you're too shook to move
Cause the streets say the words, you kid gotta prove
Living a lie, you might die, in this game of hot caption whores
Check your rearview you're being followed

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]

[Verse Four: Trigger Tha Gambler]
Eat the dick, if it be.. we gonna shoot from a block away
We keep with heat, and turn your face into a plot to play
Yeah, we spray out your feet and watch you burn in a flock away
Nerd, niggas stop and pray
Heard, they can't drop the lay
We come out, run out, one route to Dun-house
We're about to blow his wig off "yeah yeah"
Nigga we jump out, pump out, dump out
Infront of the Dun house with the sun-hounds
Shit to peel off and I'm.. running the trot like crooked cops
Taking capes, pushing weight, while I shipped this back
From California to the.. Hill Tah, Comille fitting dots
Activille for them bills and he'll get drop

[verse Five: Smoothe Da Hustler]
Look I.. show guys and buyers we're not kidding
I know the size, brothers stick-bys, when we start spitting
They go beside rocks and dodge with guns ticking
But it's devilish regardless the art is squash business

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]
Party!
(Okay party people in the house)

[Intro: Ice-T]
Yo, yo, in the place to be
My name is MC Ice-T
I got the Rhyme Syndicate with me
We about to tear stuff up, y'all feel good?
Yo, what the hell y'all wanna do, Syndicate, tonight, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Randy Mac in the place to be, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Nat The Cat, you're in the house tonight, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Donald D is in the place to be, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Bronx Style Bob is in the house, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Hen-Gee is in the house, what you wanna do, homeboy? (Party!)
My man Shaquel is in the place to be, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Yo, Toddy Tee is in the house tonight, what you wanna do? (Party!)
Yo, Everlast is in the house, come on, what you wanna do? (Party!)
And MC Taste is in the place to be, what you wanna do? (Party!)
My man Divine is in the house, what you wanna do, homeboy? (Party!)
Yo yo, I'm about to kick this party up, is that alright?

[Round 1: Ice-T]
Yo, Yo, MC Ice on a Syndicate Rhyme spree
You say you wanna be down, you gotta talk to me
You wanna get in? Put a sucker's head out
Sound a little hot for you, boy? Then, toy, get out
Syndicate mob ain't nothin' but hardened crooks
You try to diss, your butt is on a meat hook
Want some of me? You're on a mission
Bad move, you end up missin'

[Round 1: Randy Mac]
Let's get it straight for the '89 tip
Randy Mac is clockin' a stupid grip
On the party track I'm cold lampin'
But when the Syndicate rolls I be jackin'
You thought I fell off, I ain't even slipped
The Mac is cuttin' records and punks are gettin' ripped
Gangster I am, bust the lyrics like a drive-by
You wanna sleep? Well, it's lights out, beddy-bye

[Round 1: Nat The Cat]
Notorious Asiatic, tough, talented
A power entertainer
Catapultin' above the top
Nat The Cat, too swift to be stopped
I'm like Jordan, a team player on a solo flight
Lookin' down on MC's faces full of fright and fear
I slam dunk a rap through their ear to hear
Eureka! I just struck a platinum fame
In the game things'll never be the same
Because money changes everything

[Round 1: Donald D]
Once again comin' at you hyper
Donald D the Syndicate Sniper
Boston Strangler, Charles Manson
No matter what killer I mention, keep dancin'
Five Fingers Of Death, Fists Of Fury
St. Valentine's Day Massacre on a jury
Wanna convict me for kickin' black on wax
I walk the street with a battle axe

[Round 1: Bronx Style Bob]
Life ain't nothin' but a piece of existence
'Cause when you die, you's a past tense
So I like to live my life like a big carnival
Get drunk, act like an animal
I like the rock'n'roll, the funk, the jazz and hip-hop
Suckers get loud, I drop 'em
I like 

[?] Fab Five
I'm Bronx Bob, bring the beats and I'm live

[Round 1: Hen-Gee]
Black stallion, knockin' on concrete walls
Standin' tall, rappers in my face, they stall
Stutter, softer than melted butter
There's no other word, go ask your mother
Hard solid as your city sidewalk
Born in Brooklyn, can tell by the way that I walk and talk
Strollin' with a slight limp
Flyer than any big city pimp

[Round 1: Shaquel Shabazz]
Gold, girls, cold cash
On the mic Shaquel Shabazz
Supreme, the Lord, the G-o-d
Down with the Syndicate posse
It's you we rule without a tool
Mathematics in effect, it's time to school
I'm the principal and knowledge is the key
Shaquel in the place to be

[Round 1: Toddy Tee]
I climb a mountain top with just one rope
Get to the top of the stairs and say a rhyme that's dope
'Cause I'm a cliffhanger, no, I ain't a stranger
Yo, I'm Toddy Tee, and I'm a Compton banger
Wanted by the F.B.I. for transport of
Sucker MC's across the Syndicate borders
No, they can't give me no time, 'cause it's my rhyme
Everlast, get funky for me one time

[Round 1: Everlast]
Everlast is in effect gettin' big respect
Then I collect big checks
1's, 5's, 10's and 20's
A 100 g's and I'm pullin' honeys
Left and right, day and night
You gotta see it to believe it, it's quite a sight
They're all on the tip to get a sip
Of this poetic performer that's fully equipped

[Round 1: MC Taste]
Y'all played yourselves right in front of the mic
Moved your body so that the feelin' was right
But if you get lost scream out and admit
That the beat's too fast, slow it down or I quit
I'm not the kind to give you a call
To stop on a rap that I lead, so I pause
I give you 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
If that ain't enough, sit down till we're done

[Round 1: Divine Styler]
Syndicate scorned, you act obedient
Tired of your fish rhyme 

[?] ingredients
Black on black while styles 

[provide?]

[?] of brothers that's gotta be
Circlin' cyphers into molecules
Takin' over your space, that's illogical
The vocal chords on a board with 24 tracks
Get away from the break 

[?] gotta rap

[Round 2: Ice-T]
Syndicate posse growin', goin' out of control
You say we're weak? This record's shippin' gold
Power, strength, my posse got unity
We stick together and we're soon to be
In your town, we gonna bring the roof down
Ice-T and the syndicate underground
No sell-outs, 'cause it's caps we peelin'
Girls we love 'em, and shows we steal 'em

[Round 2: Randy Mac]
Knowledge and wisdom, it's a mystery
I drop science for the ones who know it's me
You say I'm dope, cool, it makes sense
I ain't conceited, I'm just convinced
Strapped for the attack Randy Mac is rollin'
The mic, the mixer, then the show is stolen
The pimp, the player, hustler ass kicker
Watch your girl, 'cause I stick her

[Round 2: Nat The Cat]
Nat The Cat, my man will rap when I'm playin' the back
Some think my stage presence is low, I think it's loud
Enough to see me flowin' and showin'
Go psycho breakin' backs like bolo
Give me the mic, a metamorphis ignite
I break down on a cat stand, I kill ya like a hit-man
And come out kickin' with the 

[?]
Rockin' on a rappin' rampage
In control of the stage

[Round 2: Donald D]
There's a mouse in my house, so I bought a cat
The cat ran away, so now there's a rat
I'm on the attack with my baseball bat
That one rat brought many others back
All through my house I set up traps
It seem like the rats have a map
But, nowadays I don't know how to act
So, now, I feed the rats crack

[Round 2: Bronx Style Bob]
Back and I'm statin' the fact
I know you're waitin' for a rap
To make you get up and start to clap
For Bob, a Bronx 

[?] Syndicate style
More bounce to the ounce and tizzy to the file
'79 the time I was inclined
To get smooth and prove that I can rock a funk rhyme
Hey, yo, ice-cube chillin'
'Cause we got the gats and knack to see the kids top billin'

[Round 2: Hen-Gee]
Impressionalist, not a ventriloquist
Don't hang out with suckers worth less than piss
Suckers can all come kiss the tip
Of my nine when I aim I don't miss
Aim it to suckers that come around jockin'
On my tip when on the radio my records be rockin'
Don't come frontin' askin' me for a pound
If y'all ain't invited means you simply ain't down

[Round 2: Shaquel Shabazz]
Wake up it's time to be noticed
I'ma do this, I'm gonna show this
Beat to be mathematical
Syndicate's in the house, let's get radical
Bum rush the show and grab the mic
Syndicate's chilllin' out tonight
They let me loose, and now it's war
Bust the mix and let the rhymes roar

[Round 2: Toddy Tee]
Grab a partner and hit the dance floor
'Cause I'm back to rock for you once more
I don't worry about what he said or she said
As long as what's said-said is done-done in my bed
The Juvenile Committee's on my side
And I'm kickin' knowledge on a natural high
And I'm feeling strong
Yo, take this mic and get the party on

[Round 2: Everlast]
This is mortal combat, there ain't no comeback
You're tryin' to get with me but you don't know where I'm at
'Cause in this world there's no bombs or guns
Just a microphone, metaphors, words and puns
Sentences and phrases, no clubs or razors
No mercy for a sucker that wages
War, I'll take the floor, even the score
Grab the microphone and proceed to roar

[Round 2: MC Taste]
Are y'all set, all prepared to start
Move in close 'cause here comes the dope part
By the way, I'm the Taste, if tracks
Could talk but they - but here go the facts
Brace yourself, you shoulda grabbed a grip
Protect your clan 'cause we're about to trip
Bass reflex, the kicks that drive, divide
The weak from the rest 

[?] can't survive

[Round 2: Divine Styler]
Syndicate's housin' all competition
We paralyze a physical powerful vision
But savage ignorant pop that's ignorant listen
Divine is 

[?] no time for style
And I rock your grey matter with a smile
'Cause I'm the rhyme thriller with dimensions of flavor
The knack - stylistic black

[Round 2: Ice-T]
The reason we're bustin' these raps are what?
To make all you wack MC's shut up
You're always buyin' rap records jammin' def beats
Then dissin' rap artists out in the streets
You always say our jams are wack but yours'll be tight
But you never been near a studio in your life
You see, disrespect is your last resort
You're like Howard Cosell, you never played this sport
But you're always talkin' mess bout how it should be done
And when we ask to hear your record you never made one
So this message goes to amateurs and pros alike
We're the MC's that cold be doggin' the mic
You may be good but there's no one better
We rock you so cold, you need a cashmere sweater
Fight dirty in the pit when combat is on
We always attack before attacked upon

[Outro: Ice-T]
Yeah, Rhyme Syndicate, we in here
We tossin' it up
I got my man Everlast in the house
Tossin' it up, you know what I'm sayin' ?
Kid Jazz and Bango couldn't be here
But we gon' to' it up for them anyhow
Wherever you are you're a star
Rhyme Syndicate blowin' up like napalm
I got my man Chilly Dee deejayin' on the set
And the one and only DJ Evil-E, we in here
Yo, we outta here like last year
Rhyme Syndicate
We gotta do it like the alphabet and A-B-C ya!
Yeah

[Everlast]
Everlast, Everlast in full effect
Where's my gold record?
Where's my record?
Where's my record?

[Divine Styler]
Divine Styler with Physical Poets, look out

[Donald D]
Microphone King Donald D the notorious, yeah

[Bronx Style Bob]
This is Bronx Style Bob...

[Ice-T]
Nat The Cat, boy

[Randy Mac]
Randy Mac
One in a million on your back, boy

[Ice-T]
Yo
So we bout to get outta here
Seems like the police is outside, man
(Yo Ice, man, they got King Tee, Aladdin and Islam)
What, the police, man?
I knew somethin' had happened
I was wonderin' why King Tee missed the party, man
Yo Randy Mac, you got some money?
(Aw, you know what time it is, man
I got...)
Yeah, for some bail, buddy
We got to go do some work, man...

[Opening Skit]
(*someone whistles*)
What's up?!
What's happening Cous'?
WESTSIIIDE!!

[Ice-T]
Here we go, another one
Iceberg, Gangsta Rap 2006, 8th album, SMG

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Time to take you back to the days of old
64 Chevys, big fat gold
Out to the west where the gangstas roam
South Central, L.A.. my home
We was out there feeling that Hip-Hop beat
But couldn't connect to the New York streets
So we took our bandanas and we tied them up
Rolled up in the studio and laid it rough
Ice Cube and them niggas with the 'tudes
Showed a motherfucker how to blast at dudes "BLAW!!"
COME ON!! Dr. Dre, N.W.A
Eazy-E and 'Ren, Fuck what you say!
Too Short kept it raw for them niggas up North
Geto Boys, we was like to fuck the law
W.C. nigga, sag your pants
We taught you how to gangbang and to crip dance

[Hook: Ice-T X2]
This ain't no R&B this is Gangsta Rap
Bitches get smacked, busters get jacked
Front if you want, you'll get laid on your back
It's about guns and drugs and ho's and clubs

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Cypress Hill made a nigga understand
How I can just kill a man
Long Beach out of the dark, came Snoop
Skinny little nigga not scared to shoot
Dogg Pound Gangsters, Kurupt and Daz
Suge had the whole Death grow on blast
King Tee motherfucker Warren G
Nate Dogg reppin that 213
Don't front motherfucker don't hate
Compton's Most Wanted, MC Eiht
Throw your sets up niggas like you don't give a damn
Inglewood, Mack 10, Watts was KAM

[Hook: Ice-T X2]

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
So you wanna really know what's real on the Mic!
My little homie 'Pac lost his life
East coast, West coast, Gun-talk rules
Cocaine, big wheels, ho's and jewels
Down South, gold teeth, niggas is real "Dirty South"
Gangsta Rap got mass appeal
Little white boys in 'burbs got heat
A ghetto is a ghetto and a street is a street
Eliminate the poverty disease
And we'll start rapping about birds and trees
You can get shot, no matter how much fucking cash you got
You can never get away, the streets stay hot (*Gunshot*)
And gangsters ain't the ones to push
They'll kill you a second ask president Bush

[Hook: Ice-T X2]
The seventh baby...

Chorus:
I represent from LA
All the way to (NY NY)
And when I get down
I get down here in LA
All the way to (NY NY)
And when I parley
I parley here in LA
All the way to (NY NY)

Touched the Iceberg baby
I'll send you under like the Titanic
Gun fight romantic
Gigantic on the pages
Of the hustler trade
World reknown for my realness
Only the real will feel this
Stainless steel is
The straps that I'm copulating
Touch'em a lady (?)
Blow your hand off
African stand-off
The general
Ice the hardest mineral
Feel me, a gem correct
One thing that I got you'll never get's respect
I stick the pits on ya
I represent California
Home of the shooters
The looters
The drug movers
Girl barracuda
Set you up for the kill
Where you're really not ballin unless you got 10 mill
I shine so bright I blind ya
Cross my crew, we'll find ya
It's a motherfuckin shame
My dominance to this game
I live for gun smoke aroma
Mack yo' bitch into a coma
Two hoes like Noah of every type
Bitches I kick to curbs, you would make your wife
Twice hit by the gun spit, kid still breathing
While half you busters in this damn game are still teething
Believe it if you say it enough that you'll be it
You never lived none of your raps, or even seen it
I mean it, every word a brother say
Everyday a brother play, kid
I politic and parley
The fact is I practice
Camoflauge to this
R & B androgynous
Get the most play
So I get fly
Do a movie - quadruple my cash
You just went double platinum
Let's see if you last
Every word that I say is documented and repeated
The truth is, I dropped the raw game, boy believe it
I've succeeded, in turning dirty dough legal
Bounced to the Bentley from the prime-it-up Regal
Like Biggie says, It's unbelieveable
My street pull
You even play like step in my way
You'll meet my people
Chorus

I've been round the world ballin, did it all, what's next?
While most of y'all busters on your first rolex
Been deep in the life kid, since 76
Touched the water, the crack game, the jewelry licks
Fix yourself if you're broke fool, that ain't my fault
The game must be taught and comprehended, then implemented
Moves done illegally, carried out strategically
Or else incarceration is felt, the hand is dealt
You lose it's frightening
Hit with 10 indictments
Kiss your baby and your wife
You're riding kites for life
Alot of y'all won't feel me, but some of y'all do
I'll move at least a half a mill of this before I'm through
That ain't the most, but I've done this longer than you
Plus it ain't my only gig, I'm still connected
With the boys that can flip a thou to a ticket
Wicked
My stature when you're in my rapture
Meet me on the street? I'm the nicest brother you meet
Confusing sometimes, the way I bust a rough rhyme
You might think I'm lying, cool I like that
I smile in your face, squeeze off the case, rock the Glock back
In your stomach, then I'll smile again
Don't want to be your enemy, I'd rather be your friend
Only the real win in the game, but what's the prize?
Every man goes through mad drama, and every man dies
Look in my eyes, touch my soul, I ain't like you
The evil I've done, I've got lots of retribution to do
That's an impossible task, cause every night the gats blast
So I look to the sky and ask
I've been blessed by God to rock this mic hard, so I do it
You got a problem, work through it
I love New York night, bright lights and action
I love bailin with my Bronx niggas, party crashin
I love switch hittin with my niggas on the shaw
You might see me in New Orleans at Mardi Gras
Or Miami at the Lex, in the Oaktown live
Or in Chi-town at the Players Ball, true P.I
Pimp or Die, Ice baby, it's a well known fact
That true players play the whole map
And we play all the way to (NY NY)

Chorus

[Intro]
A-yo Ice, man. I'm working on this term paper for college. What's the First Amendment?

[Verse 1]
Freedom of Speech, that's some motherfuckin' bullshit
You say the wrong thing, they'll lock your ass up quick
The FCC says "Profanity - No Airplay"?
They can suck my dick while I take a shit all day
Think I give a fuck about some silly bitch named Gore?
Yo PMRC, here we go, raw
Yo Tip, what's the matter? You ain't gettin' no dick?
You're bitchin' about rock'n'roll, that's censorship, dumb bitch
The Constitution says we all got a right to speak
Say what we want Tip, your argument is weak
Censor records, TV, school books too
And who decides what's right to hear? You?
Hey PMRC, you stupid fuckin' assholes
The sticker on the record is what makes 'em sell gold
Can't you see, you alcoholic idiots
The more you try to suppress us, the larger we get

[Verse 2]

[You have the right to remain silent]
Fuck that right! I want the right to talk
I want the right to speak, I want the right to walk
Where I wanna, yell and I'm gonna
Tell and rebel every time I'm on a
Microphone on the stage cold illin'
The knowledge I drop will be heard by millions
We ain't the problems, we ain't the villains
It's the suckers deprivin' the truth from our children
You can't hide the fact, Jack
There's violence in the streets every day, any fool can recognise that
But you try to lie and lie
And say America's some motherfuckin' apple pie
Yo, you gotta be high to believe that
You're gonna change the world by a sticker on a record sleeve
Cos once you take away my right to speak
Everybody in the world's up shit creek

[Verse 3]
Let me tell you about down south
Where a motherfucker might as well not even have a mouth
Columbus, Georgia, said they'd lock me up
If I got on the stage in my show and said "Fuck"
So I thought for a minute and said "No
I wasn't even gonna do a damned show"
Cos for me to change my words from my rhymes
Is never gonna happen cos there's no sell outs on mine
But I vowed to get those motherfuckers one day
They even arrested Bobby Brown and Cool J
Yo, they got their's comin', cos I'm mad and I'm gunnin'
Homeboys, and there's no runnin'
I'm gonna tell you how I feel about you
No bull, no lies, no slack, just straight fact
Columbus, Georgia, you can suck my dick
You ain't nothin' but a piece of fuckin' shit on the damned map

[Verse 4]
Freedom of Speech, let 'em take it from me
Next they'll take it from you, then what you gonna do?
Let 'em censor books, let 'em censor art
PMRC, this is where the witch hunt starts
You'll censor what we see, we read, we hear, we learn
The books will burn
You better think it out
We should be able to say anything, our lungs were meant to shout
Say what we feel, yell out what's real
Even though it may not bring mass appeal
Your opinion is yours, my opinion is mine
If you don't like what I'm sayin'? Fine
But don't close it, always keep an open mind
A man who fails to listen is blind
We only got one right left in the world today
Let me have it or throw The Constitution away

[Outro: Jello Biafra]
What they're trying to do with radio, with this, uh, McCarran-Walter Act and a lot of other ways, is start by saying that they're protecting the public from wicked rock bands, or girlie magazines, or whatever. But, if you follow the chain of dominoes that falls down what they're really trying to do is shut off our access to information itself

If they can't do it by law they know there's other ways to do it
(Today in Los Angeles another youth loses his life. Gunshot wound to the head. Street violence is at an all-time high)

Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do? Death row? What a brother know

No jokin', I'm sleepin' with my eyes open
Wanted for a homicide ride, the gun's still smokin'
Didn't know what I was doin' but did it anyway
Now the posse's on my trail, they say I'm gonna pay (Run!)
I had a gun, it's mine and I packed it
Out with my crew, the boys caught some static
Me and this sucker punk went at it
Bang! Nine automatic

Hunted Child
I'm the Hunted Child

(Sources say the assailant was 17-years old and lives in South-Central Los Angeles)

Now I'm on a hideout tip cos they're after me
LAPD says they're gonna capture me
Was I crazy? I guess I had to be
Cos once you kill it's instant catastrophe
Your whole life is over (Through!)
Forget about your girl your (Crew!)
Nowhere to run, so what you gonna do?
Be glad it's me, homeboy, and not you
The Hunted Child
I'm the Hunted Child
Hunted Child
I'm the Hunted Child

I'm only 17, I didn't mean to kill, man
But I was slangin' and bangin' for the thrill, man
When they said (Kill!) I felt chill, man
But once I pulled the trigger, boy, then things got ill, man
My homeboys dipped out the back fast
Left me alone in the echo of the gun blast
Everybody saw my face, I didn't wear a mask
You wanna know my name? Just ask

The Hunted Child
I'm the Hunted Child
Hunted Child
I'm the Hunted Child

(The science of Capitalism which you teach to the youth on the streets today with the 'ends justifying the means' mentality ain't happenin')

I'm sweatin' heavy cos my face is on TV
Everybody in this whole world's after me
Since I was young I never had a damned thing
At Christmas time I'd hate to hear the bells ring
Cos in the ghetto Santa ain't got a dime
Your mother's standin' in the welfare line
The way the youth survive is crime
My life is over so I might as well speak my mind
I killed a brother cos this system had me geared to kill
Cos what I call home you call hell
My ghetto quarters ain't no better than a jail cell
But there's a message in this story that I'm tryna tell
We're just brothers on the streets killin' brothers
This system has us geared to kill one another
Sellin' dope to poison each other
The plan of The Man, word to the mother
But I'm a sucker cos I fell into their plan
187, I killed a brother man
My life on Earth was hell, you understand?
But when I die I'm goin' to hell again
I'm the Hunted Child...

[Verse 1]
Yo! I met this girl the other night
Hype super-dope body and face, her mini-skirt tight
Talkin' 'bout legs and lips, mindblowin' hips
Had to cross my legs just to look at her tits
Said she came out lookin' for some fun
Looked me in my eyes and told me...I was the one
I said "Why?", she said I was fly
Grabbed me by my hand and I thought I would die
Said she wanted to take me home to make love
Now that's the kind of rap that brothers dream of
I said, "Fast, slow, hard or soft, baby?"
She said, "All the above"

[Hook]
This girl tried to kill me
She didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life

[Verse 2]
Now, I ain't no sucker on the weak tip
But let me tell you, she was on some motherfuckin' sex trip
Took me to her crib that night, leather and spikes
Broke out the rope and the dope strobe-light
And started buggin', lightin' candles all over the room
Then she did a backflip, landed on my dick
I knew that I would be dead soon

[Hook]
This girl tried to kill me
She didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life
This girl tried to kill me
She didn't use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me
Homeboys, watch out for this one

[Verse 3]
Yo, my pants were on, but so what?
She ripped off my shirt and tied my monkey-ass up
Faster than I could say "No!"
It was like a rodeo, I was with a sex nut
I looked in her face...
She sweated and she grinned with delight
And then she broke out a whip, I said "Shit!"
This girl had crazy plans for the night

[Hook]
This girl tried to kill me
She didn't use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me
Homeboys watch out for this one
This girl tried to kill me
She didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life

[Verse 4]
Now whips ain't all that she had
All kinda crazy shit was at this bitch's pad
I'm talking about latex suits, spike-heeled boots
Oversized vibrators so that she could get loose
I said, "Don't...don't...don't whip me!
I'll do anything you ask!"
And then homegirl stripped, 38" tits
Man you shoulda seen that ass

[Hook]
This girl tried to kill me
She didn't use a gun or a knife
This girl tried to kill me
Took me within a inch of my life
This freak tried to kill me
She didn't use a bomb or a gun
This girl tried to kill me
Homeboys, watch out for this one

[Verse 5]
My dick was harder than a bulletproof vest
She started pourin' baby oil on her chest
And then she said, "Gimme gimme gimme"
Jumped on my Jimmy, and rode me like the Wild West
I almost passed out, then the front door cold bust in
It was her fuckin' husband, six-foot ten
I knew my life would soon end

[Hook/Outro]
Homeboy tried to kill me
He didn't use a bomb or a gun
Homeboy tried to kill me
Yo...yo, nowhere to run
Homeboy tried to kill me
He didn't use a gun or a knife
Homeboy tried to kill me
Cause he had caught me fuckin' his wife
Yo...

[Intro: Coonskin]
I'm the minstrel man, the cleaning man
The pole man, the shoeshine man
I'm a nigga man, watch me dance

[Verse 1: Ice-T]
I put the lyrics on the paper with the pen
Evil E makes the records spin
Islam drops the beats that you rock to
Thought that I would never get you? Got you
Doggin the floor like you know you never done before
How could a brother be so hardcore
And still keep you on the floor like a maniac
That's your question? Well I'mma answer that
I'm on the mic tonight I'm here to do it right
Ice, the capital T, airtight
Coolest of the cool, a mack on a mission
Step to me fool - you're missin
Minus, gone, pow, you're outta here
This ain't no game to me, this is my career
Throw me a mic, plug it in, "Bet!"
I won't be happy til the dancefloor's wet
I ain't no rookie, I'm a microphone vet
Evil E's on the set, hit the deck!
{*scratching "be easy on the cut" (3X)
And "no mistakes allowed" Rakim*}

[Verse 2: Ice-T]
E-M-C-E-E, I-C-E-T, A-N-D, DJ Evil E
Doggin the deck like it's never been done before
You had enough? "MORE!"
Here we go, I'm about to blow up
Don't you dare bite my rhymes, I'll make you throw up
Poison soaked in an acid bath
Swallow homeboy, your throat'll need a skin graft
Toss it up, while the DJ known as Evil cuts
You wanna know what's happenin - "WHAT?"
The beat become my soul, I'm goin out of control
Look in my face as my eyeballs roll
Back in my head and the mic glows red
Step in my face and you'll wind up dead
{*SLAP*} Yo, thanks, I needed that
I was posessed by this treacherous track
Watch out "WORD" this ain't no joke
A sucker tried to flex and his arm got broke
Don't make a move that you'll regret
Evil E's on the set, hit the deck!

{*scratched "kick it" (4X)*}

[Verse 3: Ice-T]
You start to think and wonder bout how it's done
"An emcee? Maybe I could be one"
Drop the thought, get a job, change your mind
To be a dope MC takes time
Eight years of mine, no time for draggin
You wanna be an MC? "Get off the bandwagon!"
But if it's in your heart, get a pen
Don't stop writin til the inkflow ends
Work and work and don't halfstep
Dog the mic every chance you get
Motivation must be kept
Stay down and build your rep
Yo so let me demonstrate, rappin as a fine art
And when I'm finished, you can take this rap apart
Analyze my elements and tactics
First I'm over there, and then I'm back to this
I jumble topics, you won't know where I'll go
Back in your face with a cold but steady flow
You feel the power of the Ice in the first row
You already know what to say, "HOOOOOOOOO!!!"
On the mic is a stone cold vet
Evil E's on the set, hit the deck

{*Evil E scratches for a long time*}

[Verse 4: Ice-T]
I'm in my mode, called the fourth episode
Or the last verse, if you wanna decode
So I gotta raise the heat, hype up the beat
Switch the mic from airtight to elite
Pounce upon the deck, it ain't wet yet
Let me see how hot you can get
Then I'll turn up the amps, blow out the lights
You're in darkness, then the mic ignites
Glowin like it did before, but even more
The room is lit, the raps are hardcore
Evil cuts the records like a psycho with a switchblade
You see a blur -- that's the crossfade
Loud and proud, words bombard the crowd
Look up in the air -- you see a mushroom cloud
I kick flavor to a musical track
Too fast to catch, too complex to match
I'm gettin hyped as hype can get
Evil E's on the set! Hit the deck

[Intro]

[Ice-T] yo, yo, yo man, let me tell y'all the story man

[Posse] Oh-oh, here we go again "Stop lying"

Let me tell you what happened to me

[Posse] go a head, go a head, go a head "Stop lying"

[Verse 1: Ice-T]
The other day I spent a million on a def gold chain
It weighted thirty nine pounds, my name plate the same
I put it on, it was too heavy
So I hired me this brother to wear for me
One night, we was out chillin, he and I minus crew
I was held at gun point by a thug's .22
But when I told him that I was the L.A. player Ice-T
The brother robbed somebody else and brought the money to me
You might think I'm lyin' but man, you're wrong
As I told you before, my word is bond

[Interlude]

[Posse] You expect me believe that? "Stop lying"
You're the master of lying, man

[Ice-T] Yo, look at you with your basketball outfit on, man

[Posse] That's cause I can play

[Ice-T] What do you know about basketball, man?

[Posse] What I know?, yo, yo...

[Verse 2: Bronx Style Bob ]
I played ball back in ( name ) Park
The ( name ) on the board, hit three pointers in the dark
I got a scholarship but said: "Yo, forget it "
Goin' straight to the Pro rank, coach, so don't sweat it
The Lakers wanted to pick me, but I said: "Step"
Cause takin' Magic's spot, could be bad for my rep "what"
So he sent me to Chicago, to play in front of.. you know
But then I said: "Either he go or I go"
I gave Jordan a break, then came back to the city
You know, cause everybody missed me "right, right, right"
You think I'm lyin?, but brother, you're wrong
As I told you before, my word is bond

[Interlude: Ice-T]
Lies man, man you're crazy
Look at Donald D comin' through the door late
We're makin' a record, brother
What you're doin' so late, man
What's up, man? "Stop lying"

[Verse 3: Donald D]
My girl was pissed, so she tried to diss
The D, until I showed her my fist
I argued with her in the pouring rain
After the fightin' with her, I missed the train
It was delayed for an hour, so I fell asleep
When I woke up, I was on 14th. Street
By the time I got there, it was way too late
Came back uptown and decided to wait
Ran into her cous', and hung with him
Met Billy, Joe, Bob, Frank, Chuck and Slim
Went back to the crib to watch a VCR
And then I had to pick up my father's car
Looked around for my brother, to see where he went
And then I had to pay my mother's rent
I know y'all think I'm lyin', but listen, you're wrong
Like I told you before, my word is bond

[Interlude]

[Ice-T] Lies man, you be late to the show
How you gon' make some money, man?

[Donald] Money?, You talkin' about money?

[Ice-T] Man, I got money, man

[Donald] You ain't got no money, man

[Ice-T] Yo, check this out

[Verse 4: Ice-T]
I got so much money that the bank couldn't hold it
Car so dope that I didn't wanna roll it
So many houses, sometimes I forget
I brought a yacht and a brand new lear jet
I flew to Paris just for good meal
Then to Rome, to sign a record deal
Off to London, to kick with the Queen "what Queen?"
Back to LA, I bought a football team
I just can't stop spendin' that green
My girl loves the water so I brought baby a submarine
But see, I left my house without my credit Cards
I think I left my wallet in my other car
If you could loan me ten, I'd pay you back
Yo man, you're lookin' at me crazy, what's up with that?
You think I'm lyin' but man, you're wrong
As I told you before, my word is bond

[Interlude]

[Bronx Style: ]lyin' man

[Ice-T] yo man, I'll pay you back
Yo, you be talking about them girls you got, man
You ain't got no women, man

[Posse] That's why I went to jail, man

[Ice-T] What's up with your girl, man?

[Bronx Style] alright

[Verse 5: Bronx Style Bob]
Monday morning, walkin' down the block
Saw this girl in a Jag, y'all, and she stopped "aww man"
She said her father casted for the Cosby Show
And she said: "Bob, would you like to go?"
You know, so I went with her, and we chilled
Got her drunk off the Eight Ball, and we illed
She was stupid rich, so I bought myself an island
Charged it to her Master charge, I be wildin'
So, after that I stepped and she was cryin'
She gave me mansion, yo, why should I be lyin'?
You got me frontin'?, well homeboys, you're wrong
As I told you before, my word is bond

[Interlude]

[Ice-T] lies

[Bronx Style] Why, why it gotta be all that, why it gotta be all

[Ice-T] look at Donald, he always be lyin' about shows

[Posse] Oh, he, he be lyin'

[Donald D] yo, I ain't be lyin'

[Ice-T] Check him out

[Verse 6: Donald D]
Yo Ice, I did a concert in the White House
And after that me and Donald Trump hung out
And then I knocked Vanity boots in a limo'
I rejected Michael Jackson's demo
Smacked Freddy Krueger and he didn't reply
Hit Mike Tyson in his eye
Sharks around me and didn't die
Drank a case of Cisco and I didn't get high
You might think I'm lyin, but listen, you're wrong
Like I told you before, my word is bond

[Interlude]

[Posse] You high right now, man

[Nat] No, I'm not (Stop lying)

[Ice-T] Let, let the man with the money get it right for you

[Bronx Style] What money, man?(Stop lying)

[Verse 7: Ice-T]
You think I'm lyin' but I'm tellin' the stone truth
I have been player ever since my youth
In 1st grade I was knockin' kids out cold
In 2nd grade I was truckin' the large gold
In 3rd grade I was checkin' the youth bank
4th grade puttin' Gas in Benz my tank
By the 12th I was gamblin' outrageous
I drove through Desert and broke Los Vagus
You probably think I'm lyin' but brothers, you're wrong
As I told you before, my word is bond

[Outro]

[Posse] lyin' man, lyin' man

[Ice-T] What you talking about, man?
You and that basketball stuff you talkin' about
Donald talkin' 'bout Donald Trump,' man, y'all is crazy
Shawnie Mac, what are they talkin' about, man?
My Word is Bond, home boy

[Posse] Don't believe the hype

[Donald] My Word is Bond

[Posse] you be lyin' every time you talk

[Ice-T] y'all all drunk

[Posse] yo man, we outta here "Stop lying"

[Verse 1]
This is it, dope from the fly kid
The Ice mic is back with the high bid
Suckers you've lost, 'cause players you're not, gangstas you ain't
You're faintin', punk, if you ever heard a gunshot
Yo, the pusher, the player, the pimp gangsta, the hustler
High Roller, dead pres folder
Is cold lampin' like a black king on a throne
Evil E...turn up the microphone
So I can ill and break on the rollin' tape
Another album to make? Great
Islam turn the bass kick up a bit
Hype the snare, now I got a place to sit
And ride the track like a black mack in his 'lac
Hit the corner slow where the girls are at
And kick game the way it should be done
How you gonna drop science? You're dumb
Stupid ignorant, don't even talk to me
At school you dropped Math, Science and History
And then you get on the mic and try to act smart
Well let me tell you one thing, you got heart
To perpetrate, you're bait, so just wait
Till the press shove a mic in your face
Or you meet Boogie Down or Chuck D
Stetsasonic or the Big Daddy
And they ask you about the game you claim you got
Drop science now, why not?
You start to sweat and fret, it gets hot
How'd you get into this spot?

[Chorus]
You played yourself...
Yo, yo, you played yourself...

[Verse 2]
I'm no authority but I know the D-E-A-L
When it comes to dealin' with the females
What you got they want, cash is what they need
Slip sucker and they'll break you with speed
But you meet a freak, you try to turn her out
Spendin' money's what I'm talkin' about
But you fool out, your pockets got blew out
And after the date, no boots, you got threw out
Mad and shook 'cause your ducats got took
Call her up, phone's off the hook
But who told you to front and flaunt your grip?
You can't buy no relationship

[Chorus]
You played yourself...
Yo, homeboy, you played yourself...

[Verse 3]
I'm in the MC game, a lot of MC's front
And for the money they're sell out stunts
But they claim that they're rich and that they keep cash
Yo, let me straighten this out fast
Two hundred thousand records sold
And these brothers start yellin' 'bout gold?
You better double that, then double that again
And still don't get souped, my friend
You think you've made it, you're just a lucky man
Guess who controls your destiny, fans
But you diss 'em 'cause you think you're a star
That attitude is rude, you won't get far
'Cause they'll turn on you quick, you'll drop like a brick
Unemployment's where you'll sit
No friends 'cause you dissed 'em too
No money, no crew, you're through

[Chorus]
You played yourself...
That's right, you played yourself...
You played yourself...
Yo, yo, you played yourself...

[Verse 4]
You got problems, you claim you need a break
But every dollar you get you take
Straight to the Dopeman, try to get a beam up
Your idle time is spent trying to scheme up
Another way to get money for a jumbo
When you go to sleep you count Five-O's
Lyin' and cheatin', everybody you're beatin'
Dirty clothes and you're skinny 'cause you haven't been eatin'
You ripped off all your family and your friends
Nowhere does your larceny end
And then you get an idea for a big move
An armed robbery...smooth
But everything went wrong, somebody got shot
You couldn't get away, the cops roll, you're popped
And now you're locked, yo, lampin' on Death Row
Society's fault? No
Nobody put the crack into the pipe
Nobody made you smoke off your life
You thought that you could do dope and still stay cool? Fool

[Chorus]
You played yourself...
You played yourself...
Ain't nobody else's fault, you played yourself
* some girl repeats "OOHH Baby, My Baby" in the background

[Intro: Ice-T]
Iceberg, Gangsta Rap album, 2006, bitch!!
SMG in full effect, keeping it real gutter for you niggas
But all the gangsters out there ain't got a girl
This really especial to them, that's right!
I think it's to keep it real
And sing something to the ladies, sing something to my girl

[Verse One: Ice-T]
I love the way you move your tongue
Your sexy moves got me sprung
The way you lay me back in the bed
She loves it when she is giving me head
You make my body hot and cold
Your fat ass corrupts my soul
You get my dick hard as a rock
She gets on top and just don't stop
Five stilettos on your feet
Your pussy lips taste so sweet
So sexy walking down the street
Ain't got no problem carry a heat
You're just so goddamn fly
You're so bad that niggas don't try
I love the way you moan and cry
She is down with me, ride or die

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]
If you got a bad bitch and you know it
Keep it real my niggas, anytime the week ends to show it
Throw your hands up, if you feel the girl that you with
Fuck your homies, she is the one sucking your dick

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
I Love the way you lick your lips
The sexy way you move your hips
The vision of your big round tits
She scents the average nigga in fist
You make me want it all night long
You make me wanna sing this song
You make feel so hard and strong
She loves it when I rip her pro-tong
I love the way you stroke my dick
I love it when you start to lick
Your booty is so round and thick
She makes cum so damn quick
How she getting into those Jeans
That finest shape I have ever seen
I'm starring at you like a fiend
She makes me wanna yell and scream

[Chorus: Ice-T X2]

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
You're skin is so soft and smooth
I love it when you fill in your groove
They sexy way your body moves
She ain't got nothing to prove
You know how to bring the heat
No other chick can compete
A brother don't need to cheat
She sicks me dry and leaves me weak

[Chorus: Ice-T X4]

[Intro: Ice-T conversating with his daughter]

[Ice-T] Baby, I wanna let you know I really like how this is going down

[Daugh] Yeah, I like how it's going down too, daddy!

[Ice-T] Though we can make big moves, baby I know, real big moves..

[Daugh] Ummm.. just tell me what I gotta do and I'm down for whatever!

[Chorus: Corte X2]
Girl, if you do what I tell you to
You can have this whole world if you wanted to
Buddy, it ain't going to be easy
Just listen to a player, and please believe me!

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Let's start this off with facts
You got on some nice shoes but you walk in it
You got on nice coat but you're outside it
Now, if you're ready to accept that state you was made in upgrade
Hiding up your game in form
I can let you come over here with me and get real real warm
They say: if you knew better, you'll choose better
And you think wrong, you think wrong
You can't swing a slow batter the fast pitch
The problem with most of you women, y'all so used to loosing
You can't even figure out what you want
Now first, we gotta let you know everything
If you did - you'll be living on the side of the mountains
Somewhere in Seattle like Bill Gates
And I don't know everything that's true
But I definitely do know more than you
One thing is you got style, cause you quote my eye
Two is you got class, that's what makes you fly
Three is you're intelligent cause you're listening to me talk
And four is you're very very sexy, you can see that in the way you walk
But all that ain't work nothing if you don't get it together and move something
Now, this game is played in ones and twos, that means soloists and crews
And that's exactly what I'm trying to do, is team up with you
But you have to learn how to take some instructions, boo
Please believe this, and listen to me

[Chorus: Corte X2]

[Verse Two: Smoothe Da Hustler]
Alright, baby look..
I can see you harmonious cause your rent is more than my mortgage
So it's obvious you ain't got enough left to pay attention
But I.. I'ma renew your lease for a small fee
Then we gonna psychologically house-shop
So you can have some space for that brain of yours
Consider me Real Estate
Now, I can't front, you're fly
And you're hanging around me for some reason so I must be the shelter
They say: conversation is like a combination
So I'ma open that safe, take a turn at it
You want-a dime, yeah, you want-a dime
But your nigga paint you a picture
How much cents do that make?
Alright then.. now, what you should do
Is grow some hands on that forehead of yours
So you can hold that thought
I see you used to get in your way that's why you go on the wrong direction
You need a RUN D.M.C. and 'Walk This Way'
Don't you need two pilots to fly the plane?
But only one get to hold the steering wheel, baby
So sit back, relax your ass, cause you're flying first class
And this going to be a smooth ride, baby, and please believe me

[Chorus: Corte X2]

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Now, I'ma give you the real deal
I'm going to need at least two more inches on them heels
And that gut made up cool to you, but I'ma ask you for a stirrup or two
And as for your hair.. I ain't even going to go there
Just keep it clean and tight, and would be alright
Overall.. I think you're fine
And I'm sure I can buck out the dime
And this is going to take a little time
First, you got to forget everything you know
Cause right now..
You're on a real course to becoming a real motherfucking whore
Now, that's cool too..
But at least let me show you how to be a motherfucking pro
Cause it ain't going to be all fun
If you're fucking with me, you better duck or run
This is final level of the game baby
And it ain't going to be all biscuits and gravy
You got to have a nerve, for the motherfucking curve
Cause we can do it either way, baby
The street way, or the corporate sweet way
But no matter how me and you do it, girl
It would definitely.. be the elite way

[Interlude: Ice-T and his daughter conversation continues]

[Daugh] Awww! you know, I'm down, baby

[Ice-T] That's what I'm talking about

[Daugh] Ha ha ha ha!

[Ice-T] Yeah, I know you like it when I see you smilling..

[Daugh] Ha ha ha ha ha!

[Ice-T] Yeah girl, I see you're feeling this right..

[Chorus: Corte X2]

[Intro: Ice-T Talking]
That's what I'm talking about
Iceberg, 2006, remember this?

[Chorus: Coco]
Go Ice man!
Walking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine "UHHA!!"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind "YEAH!!"
Walking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine "UHHA!!"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Damn, this record takes me way back, to day that
I said the words I love you, I'm not the kind to say that
I spent my lights in the streets with beef crooks
Shook cats get lifted off their feet with heat
Nobody loves, you can feel the cold in their hugs
At each man checks his weapon and protects his life
The last thing on my mind was ever having a wife
NO! I'm not the type to do that, I can't commit to that
But then you stepped to me "Damn" blew my whole spot up
Dropped me to my knees, and I still don't think I got up
Uhh.. you made me re-evaluate my G
Now, I'm gangster for you, baby, you gangster for me
And we're walking

[Chorus: Coco w/ Ice-T ad-libbing]
Go Ice man! "UHH!!"
Walking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine "YOU KNOW!!"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind "UHHA!!"
Walking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine "COME ON, GIRL!!"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
The truth is, it ain't easy for a brother from the streets
To ever show affection or an aim at direction
When we roll, you're by my side, I feel pride
And my partners got no problems cause they know that you're true
And if anything just jumps off I taught just what to do
Get low, get the bail money, call up the crew
You take a bullet for me, I'll take a bullet for you
We'll do old, strolling girl
You know how we do, we're just walking

[Chorus: Coco]
Go Ice man! "UHH!!"
Walking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine "UHHA!!"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind "YEAH, GIRL!!"
Walking in the rain with the people I love, feels so fine "UHH!!"
Walking in the rain with the one I love, on my mind

[Break: Ice-T Talking]
Break it down!!
Yeah, you know, it comes at time in every man's life
Player hustler or whatever
That he realizes.. that he needs that companionship of the woman
Strong woman to hold him down, through them cold nights
Through them hardships and pains and struggles in the streets
STRESS!!
Go Ice man  -----------] Coco

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
Realized I've grown in life I had to get shot
Before I understood; that you come in this world and die alone
Don't wanna spend my life chasing flash and cash
I'd rather whip through the hood with your feet on my dash
The homies understand and they're looking for girl to their own
So they can't get out these streets and stay home
It's cold when you got no one, but I've found mine
As long as we're together, girl, I know we'll be fine
Cause we're walking

[Chorus: Coco X2]

[Ice-T overlapping the above Chorus]
UHH!! COME ON!!
Yeah girl, UHH!!
We're just.. holding hands.. holding our pistols
Rubbing your booty, yeah baby
"Yo whats up man? Yeah I gotta trunk fulla this shit
Word, broads still with me man, comin over to grapevine right now
Yo I can't talk right now man, I gotta get off this phone"

Damn, how'd I get into this scam
Roll in a car with the trunk worth 5000 grand
I came up from the curb, word
First thing it rocks, now my ride's packin crazy birds
I gotta freak in the front seat
She got crazy game, might even have more than me
And thats why I don't trust, I ain't no busta
One wrong move and I'll dust her
But she knows that, keeps a gat
Works much plastic, always stays on phat
She said she loves me
Looks deep in my eyes, sometimes cries, all lies
She only loves my cash flow, long dough
The falso love of a pimp and a ho
But me and her gotta job to do
Get this luggage back to the crew
She got scanner, I hadta listen to the pigs talk
And if they speakin about us then its jumpin off
But I ain't sweatin them at all
2 cops'll roll up and 2 cops'll fall
The lines on the highway, I'm makin my mind drift away
To my last jail stay
5 years for a 459
I'm never goin back, no matter what the crime
Surrenderin ain't me
Fuck that, I'm holdin court in the street G
For a nigga like me there ain't no ounce
My life filled with drug busts and shoot outs
Pure ghetto anger, pure ghetto anger
Pure ghetto anger, I'm addicted to danger
Some nights I crash clubs
Rollin with the posse made of well-known thugs
Cool out with the freaks
Truckin much jewels, beggin for beef
Thens some niggas roll up
Lookin for a way to pump the reps up
But I ain't the one
I'm handin out beat downs, no need for guns
Sometimes I gotta ask myself
Is all this buck whylin good for a niggas health?
I don't know why
Am I suicidal, do I wanna die?
The answerin, simple
A headache throbs in my temple
It says it ain't fair, it says it ain't right
It says its goin down tonight
We finally made it to the drop spot
King and Weston Ave, snoody fox
The posse was there, but it ain't right
Fuckin police lights
Its all goin down that road blocks
I never seen that many cops
It was a setup, my whole damn crew's gettin wet up
Big time, some motherfucker dropped a dime
But even in the flurry of gun shots
My adrenaline was boilin hot
I crash down on the floor of the ride
Punch the gas, drove that benz through they punk ass
Hit Vernor doin 90
Looked in the rear-view, no one behind me
I got on the phone
Called up the homies to see what went wrong
But no time to sweat that
I still gotta trunk fulla shit, I was on phat
I just need a cool place to hide
Dumped the benzo, slammed the G ride
Me and a freak hit a motel crash spot
The streets was hot
Rubbed me down, said she adored me
Said the gunfire made her horny
The she pushed me back on the bed
Licked me head to toe, toe to head
Then I closed my eyes real slowly
Is this love? No not me
Then I felt a pain in my chest
The smell of gun powder and burnt flesh
I looked in her face, opened my mouth
And then her badge came out

[Intro]
Oh baby, man, this is a funky track
Man, you got it goin' on, Ice-T my nigga, man
Yeah yeah, boy, they gonna go crazy when they hear this one, boy
Album 3, man, we still in effect, man
Yo, Ice, kick some of that pimp shit out there
Throw that fly shit at 'em

[Verse 1]
I-C-E B-E-R-G
What's that spell? Iceberg, baby, can't you read?
Time to bleed, slaughter, slice
Try to say I wasn't nice as we waxed them punks like lab mice
Dice 'em up, slice 'em up, dissect
Put you in a boilin' pot and let your ass sweat
Cos I rap on game you think I'm weak in a freestyle?
Well 911 you should dial
Before my posse makes a move on your mom's crib
Think we got knives and guns? We got bombs, kid
Blow up your whole block, you hear the gunshots
Throw you in the Syndicate cellar and let your body rot
Cause I'm the coldest motherfucker that you ever heard
Call me The Ice...or just The Iceberg

[Interlude]
Oh, baby, 

[?]
Man, you got it goin' on, man, and it's strong, baby
Kick that fly one to me about my man Evil E, aight?
Come on, kick it

[Verse 2]
Evil E was out coolin' with a freak one night
Fucked the bitch with a flashlight
Pulled it out and left the batteries in
So he could get a charge when he begin
Used his dick, the shit was tight
Bitch's titties start blinkin' like tail lights
Rolled her over to change a connection
Bitch's ugly face cold spoiled his erection
I'm the Ice rhymer, a big timer
And yes I'm a pimp and a player and a hustler and kinda
A mack and a poet, impressive I know it
Don't only rhyme for niggas 'cause I live my life co-ed
On the mic it's livin' breathin' hype
A 1989 type Dolemite
Cool motherfucker, word
Call me The Ice... or just The Iceberg

[Interlude]
Oh my god, mercy mercy, man, you's the coldest mother fucker in the world, man
You's a pimp nigga, man, Ice, I love you man
Throw that one at me about Charlie Jamm

[Verse 3]
Charlie Jamm fucked a freak on a ski-lift
10 below, gave her the dick
It was cold and she said "Quit!"
Charlie Jamm said "Bullshit!"
She said "Oh, oh, oh my god!"
Charlie's dick was frozen hard
But she said she never felt it
Maybe Charlie's dick melted
Yes, I'm the rhyme kicker, the hard liquor
Parental Guidance Sticker? Yeah, I'm the nigga
Triple-X is how I rate
I'm the one your parents hate
I'm as cold as cold can get
Under pressure never sweat
Cool motherfucker, word
Call me The Ice... or just The Iceberg

[Interlude]
Oh man, Ice, Johnny Rivers' got this track just kickin', boy, you know what I'm sayin'? Me and that cat Randy Mack up here lovin' this, man. Kick the one about Donald D

[Verse 4]
Out with the posse on a night run
Girls on the corner, so let's have some fun
Donald asked one if she was game
Back Alley Sally was her name
She moved on the car and moved fast
On the window pressed her ass
All at once we heard a crash
Donald's dick had broke the glass
Yes, I'm the big wheeler, the girl stealer
And if we play cards don't let me be the dealer
The Ice, cool as water, hard as stone
The black mack of the microphone
Talkin' shit the way I do
Rhyme Pays, the posse grew
Did you like Power? Word
Well this is The Ice... or just The Iceberg

[Outro]
That's right baby this is the Iceberg, man, you got it goin' on
Oh man, Beat Master B is in here, lovin' this, you know what I'm sayin'?
Got my man 

[?] in the house, boy, I got my one and only Afrika Islam cold lampin', you know what I'm sayin'?
I don't think nobody could fuck with the Syndicate, Ice, you's a mean bad cold motherfucker, man, you my nigga, man
Yo, Ice, could you loan me some money, though, man, 'cause you be talkin' all that pimp shit, man, why don't you just go on and hit me with uh, thirty or eighty thousand, or somethin' somethin'
Give me one of them jewels off your hand, man
Come on, Ice, man, come on man, yo
You's a pimp nigga
Ha ha, yo Ice
You know I like you a lot, man
Yeah, yeah!

[Ice-T]
Coolin in my crib, cold video dubbin
FBI warning? Huh, don't mean nuttin
They call that shit a crime? Yo that shit's a joke
Hit record on my dope remote
I heard my phone ringin, I wonder who could it be
It was the E, the V, yes the I-L E
He said, "We got static - word, I just got out
Punks tried to move at the club and we shot out
Bullets everywhere," Okay what's the prob?
"Ink got popped, he's dead as a doorknob."
You bullshittin! "I ain't fuckin around
The posse's rollin tonight, nigga are you down?"
I grabbed my AK, my 16, and my baby Mac
Strapped on my vest, and threw the 9 in the small of my back
I said - Chill, don't let nobody move without me
Say you know where they are?
He said, "I know where they be"
Let's peel their caps back
Let's peel their caps back
Twelve o'clock midnight, posse was airtight
Twenty-five cars, under the streetlights
Some people talked, while others cried
Ink was a brother, who shouldn't have died
Then the silence broke, Ice what's it gonna be?
38 hard brothers stood and stared at me
There were only two words that I had to say
P-A-Y, B-A-C-K
The car's loaded with a silence that could wake the dead
Pistols clipped as the chambers loaded full of lead
Everyone in the crew knew what I said
Would mean by morning, somebody else soon would be dead
Let's peel their caps back

The cars at the corner like a long black snake
Night prowlin' for a life to take
Ya see down in the ghetto it's an eye for an eye
That's the answer to the question why
In my throat, there's a lump, then I swallow it, I ain't no chump
Face of Death, then I cocked my pump
I'm a nigga on the trigger, madder than a pitbull
Just layin for a reason to pull
On you, any duck motherfucker that gets in my way
I'm insane, and my homeboy's death made me this way
But then we spot him, Evil E shot him
Dead in the face, made sure that he got him
Others ran, but no mercy to the posse's wrath
Automatic Uzi motherfuckin bloodbath
Let's peel their caps back
Let's peel their caps back
Let's peel their caps back
Then all of a sudden, a bullet came through my eye
My dome exploded and I felt my other brothers die
I drank my blood as I fell like shit into the street
My corpse stunk like a burnt out rotten piece of meat
Ten brothers died in this stupid homicidal binge
Cause whenever someone dies, nobody wins
But this drama, you'll never hear a word of
Cause all the paper's gonna read is a gang murder
Gang murder
Come on
Come on

[ VERSE 1 ]
Do this, ugh, come on, come on
Time to get wreck and kick the so on and so on
The I-c-e-T
O.G. M.C
L.A.P.D
H-a-t-e-
S (Ho!)
Watch the mic blow
I flip scripts, and the Dump drops the Ammo
Time to get wreck with the new style
It's '93 and MC's are gettin buck wild
But I - ain't a - nigga
That's gonna get left with a big zero as a figure
I'm gonna end up with a big sum
Cause if you don't like one jam, I always got another one
Different, specifically I don't copy
Tear up the track if the flow sounds sloppy
I don't play one game
I bust about a dozen cuts on my lp's, none the same

[ Hook ]
I ain't new to this
I ain't new to this
Never been
New to this
Nigga
New to this
I ain't new to this
Fool
New to this
Fuck around and catch a left and a right fist

[ VERSE 2 ]
Boom bam, I drop fat slang
When I used to hustle, used to be down with the crack game
When I was young, I used to roll with a street gang
If you wanna squabble, muthafucka, it ain't no thang
I ain't new to this, I ain't new to this
Blow your dome, I hit quick as a pugilist
Ugh, ah, what's up? Now your eyes swoll'
Thought I went soft, cause my records went gold
(Sucker) Buster, you'se a - muthafuckin punk fool
Caught you in your eye while you reached for your tool
Now it's mine, and you're blind
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop goes the nine
Yeah. what you're dissin bout, friend?
Sayin I went out, but you ain't never been in
I got r-e-s-p-e-c-t in the industry
That's somethin that you'll never see

[ Hook ]

(They can get a smack for that) Flavor Flav
(Yeah-yeah)

[ VERSE 3 ]
On and on to the funk track
Back glass shakin like shit, that's where the trunk's at
That's cause my shit's - made for
Niggas that are hardcore
Brothers is quick to hook a left to your right jaw
Girls, come on, girls, come on, girls, come on
Get your clothes off and the fun on
Girls, come on, girls, come on, girls, come on
Get your clothes off and the fun on
It's time to check cash
Jump in my 4, hit the switch and lay the ass
While the Klan try to kill me
But I wrote 'riot' on my muthafuckin will, gee
So when I'm gone, it's on
Caps goin' off on the streets like popcorn
Talkin' bout sirens till the early morn'
Word is bond
But now I just cool
Bumpin' my Gang Starr tape by my pool
I ain't new to this

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 4 ]
Check, check, I got problems with the press
Caught the punk in traffic, stabbed the sucker in his neck
(Ugh) Punk reporter tried to diss me
(Ugh) Now the muthafucka's history
(Ha) I got to make a break hardcore fat tape
Word, I don't fantasize, I don't exaggerate
Just kick correct with the 1-2 mic check
Still quick to swing, take a sucker to the deck
I'm not the nigga you should step to like a sucker
Walk up talkin shit, you best to be a good ducker
Your posse best to run from my gun
Keep my nine off safety, and E holds the other one
(Yeah, sucker)

[ Hook ]

(They can get a smack for that)

And you don't stop

Fuck, fuck around and get your punk ass dropped

Yeah

Ice-T
'93 for the underground
I ain't new ta this

[Intro]

Yeah! Right about now motherfuckers is layin for a nigga like me Ice-T
To bust some freestyle shit... but I don't do that
I just cold lounge up here at the Ammo Dump
With my nigga Alladdin, SLJ, LP and my nigga Henry G
Yeah, we do the shit like this

[Verse One]

The card after the ace is deuce
So cut the nigga loose on the 3
That's me, the motherfuckin T
I got juice, I ride on my surfboard
Rhyme hard
But only buy the shit that I can't afford
That's everything, that's why I truck big fat rings
Cause in the motherland gold is for kings
I got backup, to jack up
Punks who try to act up
Do a world tour, watch the big bank stack up
Motherfuckers get dropped with the quickness
I got an ill left and a right fist
Make mistakes and you'll lose
Or you might die
Cause I'm the wrong Ice for your bruise
And that's no lie
Meanwhile the penile is stacked to the top with my niggas
Mostly for squeezin triggas
I call em homies
Pigs call em crooks
So I write and put bucks on they books
I give a fuck about a cop or a G-man
They all talk shit
Their breath smellin like semen
I catch em in the alley all alone
Put em in the prone
Pop! Pop! Pop! To the dome

[Chorus]

It's the G-style
Gangsta style

[Verse 2]

G Style, The gangsta talk on the full plex
I got a teflon .9 and it eats vests
I take a motherfucker out quick
Just for talkin shit
Ride Rolls
Catch hoes like a mitt
LA, Atlanta, New York
Yo, my shit rocks
Chi-town, Miami, Detroit
I get much props
Because I roll with the hardcore G
Every street's the same street to me
I don't bullshit
I don't quit
Writin a rhyme fit
KKK pray each day
That I get hit
Motherfuckers try to flip on the Icepick
Move and slip
Close the eyes and catch a fuckin clip
Not in the ghetto no more
But I do hang
Got a black game
And it's sittin on them thangs
I kick the game from the street
Not the slamma
Tighten up my knockas with a big lead hammer

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]

Some of the times
I write my raps with extreme speed
Some of the times
I take the pen and make pads bleed
My mind clicks to Homocide
Bullets fly
Ladies cry
A lot of people die
Some nights I can't right
Stare at the blue lines
I think I'm a go blind
Then the beat becomes me
Sit in the dark
And write a whole fuckin LP
G Style, the gangsta talk
Never near soft
Hard as a knockout bout
It's no sellout
I keep crime in my rhyme
Cause it's my thing
Packed with guns
And drugs
And lots of street slang
A-B-C-D-E-F, and LAPD
Words from a motherfuckin OG
Ammo Dump pumps the sounds that you bump in your trunk
So turn it up punk
What'cha fraid of?
What'cha made of?
Pull the pin
Set the grenade off
Blastin sounds out ya jeep
On every city street, nigga
Straight gangsta beat

[Chorus]

[Verse Four]

Many like to dress the style, and act hardcore
Many motherfuckers are and they crack jaws
I like to lay in the cut
In a nightclub
Don't smoke bud
Drink suds
But I gets loved, mack, cool
I scope the freak with the mad backs
Hit her with the gangsta style
Cool, relaxed, bam
Put her in the Benz
Bump Too $hort, let her know
Right off the top, what's my sport
You think long
You think wrong
You got it goin on, baby doll?
But I won't sing you no love song
You either love me
Or you don't
You're either rollin tonight
Or you won't
She likes the style
Cause it don't bullshit around
Tounge in my ear, real slow
And then it went down
I gotta flip into a ill mode
Pack a clip full of hype tracks
And then unload
Music for the hardcore beatdown
No weak pop shit
Strictly underground
And if you don't like the style, as I get wreck
Ease back nigga, catch a knife through the neck

[Chorus]

[Ice-T]
Ban me? Try it
You might cause a riot
What the radio won't play, the underground will supply it
I'm a MC pirate, this loud not quiet
Radical as they make, they make a rule I'll defy it
Critics may say I'm wise, some may call my words lies
I've lived more in one day than they will in their lives
Cops hate kids and kids hate cops
Cops kill kids with warning shots
What is crime and what is not?
What is justice? I think I forgot
Squeeze The Trigger, 1986
Ain't a damn thing changed, motherfucker!

[ Shawnie Shawn ]
Yo, what's goin on Ice?

[ Ice-T ]
Yo what's up Shawnie Shawn?
Man, just trippin off this girl, man

[ Shawnie Shawn ]
Girls?
You?
The Iceberg?
Aw man, come on, spill it, man

She was a swinger
Talkin 'bout high post
She was the most
Knew she was fine, dope, fly
She didn't have to try
She brought a eye on my eye in a crowded club
I tried to stare the girl down, but she didn't budge
She moved through the crowd in a straight line
The closer she got, mad thoughts ran through my mind
Yo, what would I say, yo, how would I chill?
My mind drew a blank, the whole scene was ill
She stepped in the light, she was dynamite
Her eyes said, "I wanna be with you all night
I wanna rub you down, I wanna kiss, caress your soul
Make your body warm and cold
Do everything sexually you ever heard"
And she hadn't said a single word..
I said, "Damn, what the hell am I gonna do?"
But my eyes said the same things too
I tried to speak, she put a finger across my lips
Followed it with a kiss
She said, "I want you bad," and she moved in next to me
This woman spelled out ecstacy
Said, "I've seen on the movies and TV
I love your records, but I ain't no groupie
Just wanna love ya, cause you're a real man
And you deserve this lovin like only I can"
I wanted her bad, and I am a man
That night the shit hit the fan

[ Shawnie Shawn ]
Damn, man
Keep on with it, man
Come on now kick it, man
You gotta kick it right, though
Let me know what's up

She had a 500 S-E-L airtight
Cellular phone, brand-new, it was white on white
As we walked to the car, I couldn't help but recognize
Her small waist and sexy thighs
She had a beach house she owned and a restaurant
Took me in her crib and put Sade on
As the waves hit the rocks in the moonlight
She came up behind me and squeezed me real tight
My mind started to trip, flip, roll, and roam
What about my girl who's at sleep at home?
But before I could lock in on that thought
She broke out with a new men's watch that she had bought
She put it round my wrist, it was a perfect fit
And said in my ear, "Want you to have it"
Then she unzipped her dress, dropped it to the ground
My mind was totally blown by now
She gazed at me nude in the moonlight
Pumps still on, her body was firm and tight
I looked at her breasts as they glistened and rised
Right before my eyes
And all I could say to myself was, "Damn.."
The night the shit hit the fan

[ Shawnie Shawn ]
Man, man, man
I understand...
(The night the shit hit the fan)
Come on now
I feel it
Come on
(The night the shit hit the fan)
Damn, man
It's all that
Shit
Come on, Ice
Kick that shit

Now I'm a player, I been all around the world
Made love to many girls
But tonight this was the big league
And I was worryin about fatigue
I wanna do this girl, so she won't forget me
And I knew that she'd let me
She moved close and took my shirt off
She said my skin was soft
Then slipped her hand
Between my stomach and my waist band
Man, I couldn't take it no more
Fuck the bedroom, we use the kitchen floor
We hit skins all weekend
We didn't even eat, we just hit em again
I love to think about how it went down
But she's no longer around
Left town with some fly guy
She's on some island drinkin D'Acqueray's and Mai Thai's
But she gave me the keys to the beach house
She knows what I'm about, at least now she figured out
I ain't nothin but a straight up man
And I might need those keys the next time the shit hits the fan
Yeah

Uh!

Yeah

Uh..

Yeah

Uh

I want her

[ Shawnie Shawn ]
Damn
All that, all that
And after all that
You know?
You always know, man
In the long run
You meet another one like the other one

[ VERSE 1 ]
Woke up the other mornin, I heard a rumor
They said the gang wars was over
I told em they was bullshittin, they said it's real as hell
Can't explain the way I felt
Too many years I seen my brothers die
And I can't say that shit was really that fly
But I used to gangbang when I was younger
So it's really hard to tell a kid that he's goin under
I never thought I lived to see us chill
Crips and Bloods holdin hands, the shit is ill
But I love it, I can't help it
Too much death on the streets, and we dealt it
Van Ness Boys, The Hoovers, The 60s
Bounty Hunters, 8-Treys, all coolin out, gee
I pray the shit'll never stop
You used to see the wrong colors, and the gats went pop-pop
But now the kids got a chance to live
And the O.G.'s got something to give
That's love, black on black, that's how they made it
And if any busters flip, they get faded
L.A. is where I'm speakin of
Peace to all the gangsters, cause I got a lotta love

[ VERSE 2 ]
I got a lotta love, cause you're all my brothers
Red or blue, black's the color
We got a chance, so we can really sweat the real fools
Show those muthafuckas the real tools
Check the enemy, it ain't the family
Not 1-11, try L.A.P.D
They gotta understand, they beat on a blackman
There's gonna be drama, know what I'm sayin?
And if we flip, let's all flip together
Cause I'm prepared, kid, for rough weather
And we gotta realize, the boys on the east side
You call em Eses, I call em allies
Because the day that we all unite
Watch the pigs get real polite
Punk muthafuckas gotta learn quick
That we ain't takin no more shit
L.A. is where I'm speakin of
Peace to all the gangsters, cause I got a lotta love

[ VERSE 3 ]
Crenshaw Boulevard, Sunday afternoon
Folks sittin on things, mad systems boom
The girls are lookin better
The gang truce is on, so you wear whatever
At Venice by the ocean
Rag-top Trey hits the three-wheel motion
There's gangsters all around
Still crazy sets, but you just don't clown
I pray L.A. can stay this way
It's the first summer I can really say
I felt cool, we all chilled
Went to the park, and nobody got killed
Now if you got a problem, it's man on man
You don't need a gang to solve em
I seen the greatest thing I seen in my life
Two brothers in a straight up fist fight
Nobody pulled a gat, nobody jumped in
Nobody pulled a knife, nobody got done in
L.A. is where I'm speakin of
Peace to my city, cause I got a lotta love

[ VERSE 4 ]
G-a-t-e-s, I hope you wear a vest
Even after you're out the fuckin office
Cause we're on a totally different tip
Fuck that pig brutality shit
This unity is gettin to me
Every brother on the street is my homie
I'm rollin through a hood that I never been
And every brother steps to me as a friend
I love it, I love it
And nothin in my life will ever be above it
We wanna see our kids all grown up
We're tired of seein our hoods get blown up
L.A. is a great place
Fly girls, dope cars, life at a fast pace
But gangbanging was killin it quick
Another child got hit - bullshit
Pop-pop-pop, 10 on a weekend
We was goin off the deep end
But now we got a chance, my friend
To mend, and make the colors blend
Let's all go out on a picnic, kick shit
And squash all the static
Last year I lost about five homies
This shit is real to me
L.A. is where I'm speakin of
Peace to all the gangsters, cause I got a lotta love
Yo
This is goin out to all the gangbangers
All over South Central
Watts
Inglewood
All over L.A., basically
East L.A
Youknowmsayin?
It's basically goin down
Peace to all the Crips and the Bloods
Van Ness Boys
Hoovers
Rollin 60s
83's
Bounty Hunters

Song: Home Invasion

All right! When we go up in this goddamn house
All I want is the motherfuckin' kids!
As far as pops I don't give a fuck what you do...
Bust him in his motherfuckin' head!
If he got any money, take it!
If there is money there, rob the motherfuckin' joint!
As far as moms bust her in her goddamn head!
Dumb bitch, that's the reason we're going up in there!
She don't know what the fuck she's talkin' about!

Everyone get back, this is a rap jack
I'm takin' your kids' brains, you ain't gettin'em back
With a move of perfection, my dissection
Some call it lethal injection
I'm gonna fill'em with hard drums
Big drums, bitches, hoes and death, come on and get some
I'm not the nigga that you want to leave your kids alone with
Cause I got my own opening-dome kit
And once again I'm gonna put them under my fuckin' spell
They might start givin' you fuckin' hell
Start changin' the way they walk
They talk, they act, now, whose fuckin' fault is that?
The home invader...
Yo, moms you can basically just suck my dick!
This is a home invasion...
Yo, pops that shit you talkin' is noise! Word! You full of shit!

Check this out, moms, I said time bomb
And they sit in your house and remain calm
Till you feed'em lies and the flip
Start talkin' crazy shit (Fuck you!)
Might call you and pops a fool
Tell ya that's why they hate school
Been offensive and askin' questions
Give your brain indigestion
Why? Why? Because I have indoctrinated the youth
They're mentally intoxicated with truth
So they know the noise you talk are lies
Pretty damn soon they'll be by (I'm outta here)
They listen to me and I give'em the real
And every night caps get peeled
And every night a ho gets smacked
A fool gets jacked
Now, whose fuckin' fault was that?
The home invaders...

Yo! Yo! Yo!
All that shit you taught me, mom, was full of shit!
Know what I'm sayin'?
How the fuck you gonna tell me to run my motherfuckin' life?
Bitch! You dont even know who the fuck you are!
You talkin' about you don't like rap, you don't like how I dress!
Yo! Fuck you and pops! I'm outta here!
Both of y'all can kiss my ass...
All cops want me, so does the F.B.I
Because my rhymes are fly
They still tryin' to stop me, shut me down, block me
Make motherfuckas boycott me
But that will never happen, it's impossible
I move straight through all obstacles
They say I'm fuckin' up the minds of little kids
But half of my fans are in college
P.M.R.C. suck my dick, please
You can kiss my ass while you're on your knees
Word! You're listening to the verbal assassinator
E's the crossfader, your factual updater
Until your cranium grows like uranium
Hard as titanium, parents, I'm blamin'em
For teachin' you lies about life, racist viewpoints
And other trite bullshit they learned back in the day
While I learned about death from an A.K
But they'll never quite understand
Bam, bam, bam, no gat is the Walkman
Boom, bash, yeah, yo, it's goin' down
Me and Ice Cube are in town
But the fuckin' pigs cancelled the concert
They're just scared of some niggers that do work
What they do? What did I do?
Just say truth motherfucka and it's comin' through
I tell you what we did: we stole your fuckin' kids
The home invader...
All right! we got the motherfuckin' kids!
We outta here! C'mon...

Song: That's How I'm Livin

I was born in New Jersey, I said it before
But I guess nobody heard me
My mother died young
No sisters or brothers, I was the only son
When I was twelve my pops died too
What a brother was supposed to do?
They sent me out West
To live with my aunt
I guess they though it was the best
But there was no love there
Growin' with no moms
I guess I was prepared to live in a vacuum
The bedroom, the kitchen, the hall and the bathroom
I didn't leave home much, didn't like L.A
Didn't have no friends to trust
Got bused to a school
Blacks and whites, I guess the shit was cool
But in highschool I changed
Didn't wanna bust, didn't wanna play the game
I walked to Crenshaw High, shit was fly
I hooked up with a new crew
Some brothers that seemed like they knew what the fuck to do
You might call it "gang" but we called it a set
And it was our own thang
The whole school was down
And one way or another everybody fucked around
Whether hardcore or not
You wore the right color or your ass got shot
That's how I'm livin'...
I did three years in and made close friends
Havin' no love my homies became my only
I was glad: the family I never had
But I grew up fast, got a girl on 10th grade pregnant
Needin' cash, I had to change my style
Switched from bangin' to hustlin'
No more goin' buckwild
Had to get a cashflow
But my hustle was weak, it was a no go
I joined the army, four years in that shit
Be all fucked you can be
Came back to the hood
My homies had done good
Had elevated their game
About 100 gees a lick, no mothafuckin' shame
Passed for the jewels
Baby sledgehammers with the tools
I speak on this with hesitation
Even though it passed the statue of limitations...

I checked the bank
Bought a porsche and gear, earn high streetrank
But as I grew my whole crew fell through
Cops had us on the books as interstate crooks
Murder robbery rape escape, the whole damn nine
You robbed a nigga blind
I had too much juice, I cut my boosters loose
I was in tread with the pimpgame
Took on the Ice name
But the pimp game moved too slow
Especially for a nigga who was hooked on quick dough
In one night late I was in a carwreck
And I was lucky to escape
Hospital for ten weeks, in bed almost dead
And when I got well, I got caught in a cross
And got locked in a jailcell
That's how I'm livin'...
They cut me loose
And I had to change troops
This time they didn't catch me
Next time they'll stretch me
Cause my time was gettin' short
All my homies was in court
Or locked in a hole, this shit was gettin' old
So I changed my life
Put down the gun and picked up the mic
It took ten years to get from there to here
But I still keep a gun, cops got me on the run
And they hate me more now
Than they ever did before
My homies came back from pen
And we all worked together
True friends but every once and while
Some punk mistakes me as a chump
And he gets in my face
Wrong mothafuckin' place
And I ain't lyin', that's how you dyin'...
Yo, Ice, you been down with the struggle for a long time, man...
Why don't you drop some knowledge for these brothers who
Want to get involved in this war...

Take notes: real gangstas wear trench coats
Grey suits, black ties and they seek votes
And you're not to be misled
They'll kill you in your fuckin' bed
They don't sell dope, yo, excuse me, yes they do
But they don't look that much like me or you
But if you pull up the sheets and expose them
They'll crawl up like snakes and show fangs of venom
Now I've been soldier for years
Representin' the tattooed tears
Other brothas locked up with no choice
Left in the bowels of the devil with no voice
My phones are tapped, my crib is bugged
My car is tailed from club to club
And this ain't no fuckin' joke
They want to see a nigga broke
You can't slip, if you slip you're out
You gotta know what you're talkin' about
Drop science every chance you get
Hit direct and indirect, speak in code
Cause you're never alone
That's why I use this low tone
Follow this and you might grow older
This is a message to the soldiers...
Now they killed King and they shot X
Now they want me, you could be next
All you gotta do is speak too loud
All you gotta be is be too proud
Cause once you let'em know
Who you are and where you're at
You better watch your back
Cause you might think you're just dope
While you're livin' in a sniper's scope
I'm not tryin' to scare you
But there's a danger if you get too deep
Some nights I don't sleep
All you wanna do is tell the truth
All you wanna do is save the youth
Ice Cube knows, Souljah knows, P.E. knows
They throw death blows
And if you got kids or a girl that's true
They'll move on them too
But when I'm gone I need you to carry on
You gotta be strong and fight for our salvation
But there will be retaliation, soldier...

To think that rap couldn't be attacked
Is ignorin' the simple fact
That they never ment us to speak
They had planned to keep the black man weak
But rap hit the streets
Black rage amplified over dope beats
Now they want to shut us down
And they don't fuck around
Check the history books, son
Black leaders die young
They tell us that your words are scary
They're revolutionary
Because we speak the truth
About crime and drugs
And expose the real thugs
This info is not beneficial
To the groups that go by three initals
So they try to discredit
They'll dog you with an edit
Print the words the way you never said it
But we gotta make'em regret it, soldiers...
Word! I know a lot of brothas out there want to get in this war...
You know what I'm sayin'? a lot of sistas got a lot of knowledge to drop on our people. But right now they're movin' to shut down all hip-hop. The first amendment had absolutely nothin' to do with black people, at the time constitution was written, we were considered nothin' but property...The expectation of havin' black people speak on records never came to mind, so we gotta move!
But believe me, all the black leaders have been silenced and most
Of the time it's been violent, so if you choose to get in this war
Realize what you're in for but we gotta move on...
And we gotta stay strong...

Message to the soldiers, welcome to the struggle...
Message to the soldiers, be careful, soldiers...
Yeah! 1993, I'm back motherfucker, this is Ice T
Got my nigga Ice Cube in the motherfuckin house
Yeah! Up here in the Ammo Dump studios I got my
Nigga Aladdin, SLJ's in the motherfuckin place
Behind the mixin boards
We about to do dis shit like this here!

Verse 1:

It's goin down tonight in L.A
Buckshot and uzis spray
Microphone blowa
The bitch checka, the ho wrecka
Ice motherfuckin T, nigga step to me
But grab ya hoes quick
Cause the Syndicate's throwin that crazy dick
Punk motherfuckers run up
You'll get done up
We'll have your ass gunned up
Before sun-up
So what's the color I'm raggin?
Been a millionare for years
Still saggin
Left pocket's stuffed with a huge ass brick
.380 in my right so it sags a little bit
More than the rest of my gear
When I'm on tour
I empty clips, bust lips and I break jaws
Cause I love to loc up
So punk motherfucker don't choke up
When you're talkin to me
Chorus:

Ice, Ice motherfuckin T (x4)

Verse 2:

Bush, Quayle and Clinton got a problem with me:
The motheruckin T
I give less than a fuck about any of them
Or their fuckin police friends
They'd like to take me out
Make me a goner
They even tryin to sweat Time Warner
Why?
For tellin the truth to the youth
That a lot of motherfuckers are hot
And want police shot?
You can't stop the shock (?)
The fires are out
But the coals are still hot
I got juice to bring pain
You tryin to fuck with the Ice
Are you insane?
This shit is bigger than me
Be warned
It's the lull before the storm
And every fuckin thing I write
Is gonna be analyzed by somebody white
Chorus

Verse 3:

Run motherfucker, hide motherfucker, trip motherfucker, die motherfucker
You don't give love and you won't get loved
You don't push and you won't get shoved
No joke, I ain't here to laugh, I ain't here to cry
But every night of the wee kone of my homies die
Eeny meeny mynie moe
Blood's pourin out the naps of your afro
It could be you, could be you, could be you
Could be your whole damn crew
It happens real quick
Screechin tires, next thing you're hit
Your body's cold, your body's hot
You feel your chest, you gasp for breath, you're shot
And now your homies is trippin'
Lookin for a gat to put they clip in
Street crime-
That's the thing I bring, Ice T
Ice-T I rap, BC I sing
They call it controversy
I call it truth with no mercy
The beats are phat, Ammo Dump tracks
The kind that make speakers crack
Not made for squares or the weak punks
That made to bump trunks
Press- get the fuck out my fuckin face
I ain't got no more time to waste
A ho is a ho, a bitch is a bitch, a nigga is a nigga and that's it
I'm through explainin the shit
You just makin me backtrack
The next duck reporter might get hit with a blackjack
Plus, every one of my true fans
Totally understands a nigga like me
Chorus (x2)
* Styled after AZ the Visualizer from the album _Pieces Of A Man_

[Intro: Ice-T talking]
Yeah, Iceberg, 2006
Been out the game for a minute
You know, just checking it out
To tell you the truth; most of y'all niggas sound real soft, real happy
Everyday niggas ask me for that gangsta shit

[Kryst]
It's a new life for me, yeah

[Ice-T]
Confessions of the ghetto nigga, cursed at birth
I brought the guns to the Rap game, bitches and work
Hit your body with the pump shotie, watch you jerk
L.A. Westside, nigga, now in New York
The berg; nothing gave out the words I say
I'm a grown man, ain't got no fucking time to play
Step on the game once, I recruite and parlay
Slide out it for a minute, step right back in it
Why not?.. y'all niggas don't rap that good
The truth is.. y'all niggas ain't all that hood
You act like gangsters but ain't got the heart to be one
I act so I know the fucking actor when I see one
Too much security, too much crew
Too much hype, nigga, not enough you
Me!?, they call me double O.G

[Chorus: Kryst]
It's a new life for me, yeah
Birds flying high, you know how I feel?
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel?
Reeds drifting on by, you know how I feel?
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me, yeah

[Ice-T]
See me in the streets or bowling up in the club
Me and Lil' Ice roll like lawn wolf and cub
Don't worry about the clips, nigga, watch my fist
Watch my bitch, watch my new compact disc
Your album is garbage; filled with love songs for pussies and hoes
I keep it gully, nigga, every one knows
It's all the game, til you see the flame filled the pound and
Security is on their toes every club that I'm in
Cause they know I don't give a Goddamn
Never bust techs cause them fucking shits jam
Respect! but I don't respect that much
I like Mobb Deep and Nore' -- some mothers like Shyne
Game from the Westcoast, them niggas can rhyme
Keep it hardcore, keep the shit gully and street
And don't let soft R&B niggas make your beats

[Chorus: Kryst]

[Ice-T]
Who's the fucking greatest MC and who cares?
Who can fucking shit on my name and who dares?
I straight reinvented this whole fucking game of rappin'
I'm may not be a General, I'm damn sure a Captain
Pull your pants up, nigga, lean back
You're strapped, but ain't got the heart to squeeze that
The rap game's in the ER laying on its fucking back

[Chorus: Kryst X2]

[Ice-T]
Confessions of the ghetto nigga, cursed at birth
I brought the guns to the Rap game, bitches and work
Hit your body with the pump shotie, watch you jerk
L.A. Westside, nigga, now in New York
The berg; nothing gave out the words I say
I'm a grown man, ain't got no fucking time to play
Step on the game once, I recruit and parley
Slide out it for a minute, step right back in it

[Intro: Ice-T Talking]
Yo, shut up! This is Ice motherfuckin' T
And I've been listenin' to a lot of DJ's get on the mic
And try to get busy you know what I'm sayin'?
But can't no DJ get wrecked like my motherfuckin' nigga Evil-E
So right about now I'ma give you the motherfuckin' microphone

[Ice-T] Yo E I think I'm hittin' a seminar in a DJ competition

[Evil-E] And Evil-E is the fuck outta here
It's goin down
From the Ammo Dump
I got my nigga SLJ and DJ Aladdin
Droppin the fat tracks
Hit em with it
Syndicate's in the muthafuckin house
All duck MC's get flat, muthfuckas
Yeah

1993
And it's still me
A rappin brother from L.A., the cool T
Diss a brother, hate a brother, I still come back
With the fat tracks, fuck the pop crap
I got a mind to cold diss a fool
Wack rappers sellin out urge me to pull tools
For no reason
Pop suckers hookin for hits like hoes skeezin
Prostitutes that can't shoot, yet you clock loot
Dancesteps with the weak styles, but you look cute
Bitch, that shit's wack
Let Hammer dance, and you other fools ease back
The microphone in some twist in a clenched fist
Mind locked on ???? load of my hit list
And make duck rappers pray
Many talk shit, but none step this way
Cause I'm quick to beat down a weak clown
Clock crazy juice from L.A. to the Boogie Down
I play the whole map
Got hoes locked like a muthafuckin bear trap
Ice muthafuckin T
Before hoes gee they need two forms of I.D
Never fess, not the best, but I'm hard to shake
Huh, watch the Ice break
Watch the Ice break

Yo, let's see now who's tryin to diss me
Say I sold out cause I rocked with the B.C
Y'all are bitches, you're straight wack
Quick to talk shit, but always behind the back
I do whatever I wanna do, punk ho
I rock a perm, you rock an afro
I wear khakis, while y'all wear silk
Y'all drink forties, and I drink milk
Cause that's my muthafuckin biz
I never sell out, cause it's no sale, kid
Hardcore to my heart from the fuckin start
Whether done over beats or loud guitars
I drop the dope hits
Case you forgot, I invented this gangsta shit
You wanna step to me? New jack, walk
Come back in five LP's, then we can talk
You're just new, kid, you got a hit out
In interviews you talk a lotta shit out
You got paid, you really made out
You went broke when your one jam played out
Now you're searchin for that one more hit
Shhhiiit
I ain't new to this, I got gangs of gold
I come original, then I break the mold
Too many MC's hit, then fold
They're just fakes
Hah, watch the Ice break
Watch the Ice break

Yeah
Syndicate jumpin off 1993
On some old fly smooth shit
All the muthfuckas out there down with us
You know what I'm sayin?
We're rollin strong
All the busters out there that got some static to say
We're settin this shit off physically this year
Like KRS-One says:
Sucker MC's duck down
Muthafuckas ain't takin no shit
I'm swingin on busters, point-blank
Diss me and it's on
Straight up

Now it's the break of dawn
And the mic is still on
All hoes are fuckin and the rhymes are damn strong
Many MC's that choke from the mic smoke
Those who tried to get with me
Lost in rhyme infinity
Or they lost breath
Try to step to the Ice equals sure death
Cause ??it's then I begin?? than you ever assume
Drop the mic, go rap in your living room
I love the quick kill
Swing on a nigga sometimes just to break ill
Knuckle up, buster, fool, in his fuckin eye
All hands, I need no gun, yo punk, why?
Cause if I pull my gun, you die
No second try
I gotta cool out now, so I don't over-freeze
Nut up and start murderin MC's
Start catchin bodies from state to state
Throw on a ski mask and walk the streets late
And do me up a whole damn crew
The Geto Boys was trippin, but my mind's trickin me too
Cause diss me, and I meet you one day
And bet your life it won't be a fun day
I hope, nigga, it's not your fate
That you're around when the Ice breaks
When the Ice breaks
Yeah

Yeah

Check this out: now I'm black
But black people trip
Cause white people like me
White people like me
But don't like them
What's the fuck up
Are you my friend?

Hell no, you're a racist
You say you got one black friend, so you're in
Sorry homie, no win
Check the facts
Mexicans are still gettin pushed to the back
Puerto-Ricans gettin dissed the same
Won't speak on the Indians, shit's insane
Fuck John Wayne
I don't hate whites
I just got a death wish for muthafuckas that ain't right
You got black skin
Still you gotta show and prove, friend
Back to the facts
What about Australia?
A fuckin failure
The Aboriginal people are black
So they got jacked
You ask me about free speech and the Riots?
So what's in store?
I'm talkin bout a race war
(Get yourself together)
(Open your eyes
Get wise)
(Put your brain in gear)

Race war
People gettin killed in the street
Blood on your feet, the ends don't meet
And who they gonna blame it on, me?
Try the media
Try the P.D
Try your TV
Try your quest for wealth
Anybody but yourself
But once the bullets start flyin
People start dyin
It's all because we're lyin
History books that teach hate
A kid has no escape
From the racist fate
And pretty soon South Africa
Will stop chillin
And start killin

Race war (8X)
Every night I pray
That people get this shit together one day
But this country ain't with it
America was founded on that racist shit
I judge the devil by his deeds
It's usually connected to the size of his greed
And keep the hope
Even though they'd love to give a nigga like me the rope
And when this shit hits
There's gonna be a lotta white kids rollin with the Africans
You can't sweat skin
Cause there'll be a lot of blacks is down with the Republicans
This shit don't have to happen
That's why a brother like me's still rappin
Just treat each other right
Either that, or you're lookin for a sure fight
Fuck the police
We already know they ain't about no fuckin peace
You wanna know what I think's in store?
Justice or a race war

(Get yourself together)
(Open your eyes
Get wise)
Race war
(Get yourself together)
(Open your eyes
Get wise)
(Put your brain in gear)
Race war
(Get yourself together)
(Open your eyes
Get wise)
(Put your brain in gear)
Race war
(Get yourself together)
(Open your eyes
Get wise)
(Put your brain in gear)
Korean people live down in the hood
A little mis-fuckin-understood
Orientals were slaves too
Word to this fuckin red white and blue
People from Iran ain't never did shit to us
So why the distrust?
The system wanna keep us at each other's throats
While we're payin the tax notes
Cause bein black ain't no fuckin minority
It's the fuckin majority
So they gotta make us hate each other
Word, check the brothers
Mexicans - black
Jamaicans - black
Iranians - black
Indians - black
Hawaiians - black
Puerto-Ricans - black
Eskimos - black
South-Americans - black
Orientals - black
Yeah, that's right
The Klan says everything's black that ain't white
So we gotta get our facts straight
Cause the shit they teach in school is pure hate
Sometimes I don't know for sure
If somebody want a race war

(Get yourself together)
(Open your eyes
Get wise)
Race war
(Get yourself together)
(Open your eyes
Get wise)
(Put your brain in gear)
Race war
(Get yourself together)
(Open your eyes
Get wise)
(Put your brain in gear)
Race war
(Get yourself together)
(Open your eyes
Get wise)
(Put your brain in gear)
Who wants a race war?

( *quotes repeated until end* )

We're gonna lose

[Verse 1]
I once knew this brother
Who I thought was cool with me
Chilled out together
Even went to school with me
Fly nigga, my ace boon coon
Used to low ride together
Shot dice in the bathroom
Ya want trouble?
Well trouble ya found
Cause we diss ya, then issue
The critical beat down
He needed money
I would always come through
Needed a car? He could use mine too
But bust this!
Out on the street
People say he was riffin'
Callin' me a sucker
Talkin' bout how foul I'm livin'
Someone heard him
Poppin' that shit last week
Frontin' for some pussy
From some big-butt freak
Sayin' I'm his worker
I was on his dick!
Talkin' that craazy old weak assed shit
And after all of that
She still walked away
How ya gonna diss your boy
To get some play?
And when I stepped to him about it
He said, "Who snitched?"

[Bridge 1]
Yo, how did he go out?
He went out like a bitch!
So ladies
We ain't just talkin' bout you
Cause some of you niggas
Is bitches too!

[Chorus]
"You ain't nothing but a... "Bitch!..." "Nigga..."
"Some of you niggas are bitches too"

[Verse 2]
I knew this brother named Mitch
Stone player
He meet a girl, in five minutes he'd lay her
Trucked crazy jewels
Hands smothered in ice
Been to prison not once, but twice
Kept a stupid thick posse
Made of thugs and
Crooks and hoods
And vet hustlers
Who were up to no good
But they all stood behind him
And watched his back
That's the only way
To roll on the track
But yo
Mitch got rushed by feds last week
They snatchbared the trunk
Of his white Cornice
Took a look inside
And what did they see?
Two keys, and a gallon of PCP!
Oh shit! The thought crashed
Mitch's subliminal
Three strikes, that's called
Habitual criminal
So instead of goin' under
He snitched on his whole posse
Maxed at the crib
And sipped Martini and Rossi
Sold out his whole crew
That rat named Mitch

[Bridge 1]
Yo, how did he go out?
He went out like a bitch!
So ladies
We ain't just talkin' bout you
Cause some of you niggas
Is bitches too!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I knew this guy
That was never that fly
Couldn't act cool
Even when he tried
When we played rough
He always cried
When he told stories, he always lied
A Black brother
Who was missin' the cool part
He had the color
But was missin' the true heart
When we would fight
He would always go down quick
So he took karate
And he still got his ass kicked
But now he's married
And he kicks his wife's ass
Says it comes from problems
That he had in the past
Doesn't like Blacks
Claims he's upper class
Joined the police, got himself a badge
Now he rolls the streets
And he's out to jack
Doggin' young brothers
Cause they usually don't fight back
Got a White partner
And he asked for that
And every night
Another head they crack
So now he's big man
But he really ain't shit!

[Bridge 2]
Yo, how did he go out?
He went out like a bitch!
So ladies
We ain't just talkin' bout you
Cause a lot of these pigs
Are bitches too!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Out one night with my crew
And some new kid
I didn't know homeboy, but Evil E did
So I thought he was cool
We rode in his ride
Rag top tray on Daytons
Lifted side to side
We hit the party deep
Niggas was hawkin' me
You could feel the vibe
Of thick artillery
Parliament was on, some O.G. shit
I put my back to the wall
And felt my pistol grip
Al of a sudden
Niggas started trippin'
Flippin', the record started skippin'
Wildin', fools started locn up
Gats cracked
The room started smokin' up
Me and "E" hit the floor
And then the back door
My boys let off an automatic encore
But when we made it out to the ride
It was gone, we had to shoot it out
Side by side
Punk left us there to die in a ditch!

[Bridge 3]
Yo, how did he go out?
He went out like a bitch!
So ladies
We ain't just talkin' bout you
Cause you scary-ass niggas
Is bitches too!

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
So if you're wonderin' why we lookin' at you funny, it's cause
(some of you niggas are bitches 2)
You always tell a brother you're gonna loan him money but you don't cause

(some of you niggas are bitches 2)
I know the real brothers

[Intro: TV Interviewer]
Ice-T, after your tremendous success on your past album
Some have said; you have sold out
Because of the use of rock'n'roll in your music
How do you reply to that?

[Ice-T replying]
You see, a lotta people don't realize that, you know
Rock'N'Roll is truly black music
It was created by Chuck Berry, Little Richard
Even black people like that, who started it off back in the day
You know, and as far as I'm concerned music is music
I don't look at it as Rock or R&B all that kind of stuff
I just look at it as music, you know
And anybody who said that I've sold out, they can basically suck my dick
Cause I really don't give a fuck about that shit, you know
But uhh.. I do what I like, I happen to like Rock'N'Roll
And uhh.. I feel sorry for anybody who only listens to one form of music
You know, right now, I got my own Rock band, it's got to jump off
It's really black hardcore band called Body Count
And uhh.. on some of the records I'm like laying some vocals on it
And uhh.. I got a tape of it right here, yo, check it out

[Song's Intro: Ice-T]
You know, sometimes I sit at home, you know, and I watch TV
And I wonder what would be like to live in some place like
You know, The Cosby Show, Ozzie and Harriet
You know, where Cops come and got your cat outta the tree
All your friends died at old age
But you see.. I live in South Central, Los Angeles
And unfortunately... SHIT AIN'T LIKE THAT!!
It's real fucked up!

[Verse 1: Ice-T]
God damn, what a brother gotta do
To get a message through
To the red and white and blue
What? I gotta die before you realize
I was a brother with opened eyes?
The world's insane while you drink champagne
And I'm living in black reign
You try to ban the A.K
I got ten of them stashed
With a case of hand grenades

[Hook: Body Count]
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!

[Verse 2: Ice-T]
You'd know what to do
If your kid got killed on the way to school
Or a cop shot your kid in the back yard
Shit would hit the fan motherfucker and it will hit real hard
I hear it every night, another gun fight
The tension mounts, on with the Body Count

[Break: Ice-T]
Yo Beatmaster V, take these motherfuckers to South Central

Ha ha ha, yeah, fuck that

I hear it every night, another gun fight
The tension mounts, on with the Body Count

Last weekend thirty seven kids killed in gang warfare in my back yard

NO!!, NO!!, NO!!

Yo Ernie C, take these motherfuckers home, yeah

Yo, we're in the house, Body Count fool, 1991 motherfucker

I hear it every night, another gun fight
The tension mounts, on with the Body Count

[Verse 3: Ice-T]
God damn what a brother gotta do
To get a message through
To the red and white and you?
What? I gotta die before you realize
I was a nigga with opened eyes?
The world's insane while you drink champagne
And I'm living in black reign
Don't you hear the guns?
You stupid, dumb, dick sucking, bum politicians!!

[Hook: Body Count]
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!

[Outro: Ice-T]
The tension mounts...
Off to the studio late night
Time to cut another track
It's gotta be hype
Got my rhyme book in hand
A blue loose leaf
Anybody move on that
They get loose teeth
Evil's got the funky beat
A stupid dope loop
But the record's kind of old!
(What we gonna do troop?)
We gotta clean it up
Cause it's so dope
Tried the rubbing alcohol
Even the Ivory soap
But no matter what we do
The record keeps clickin'
FUCK IT!
Evil E, give me some of that
Damn fried chicken!
Here we go, I'm movin' off death row
Ya gotta keep up hops, ya can't be slow
‘Cause their towers are high, they got the high gats
Check the perimeters good, Read the maps
It's night, they might not see us
‘Cause if they catch us out there, they'll bleed us
Shoot us, kill us, dump us in a dark ditch
Clean it up, call it a gang hit
I gotta make my move, ‘cause I'm a renegade
I recognize when mind techniques are being played
It's a plot they use to keep down another
Here comes another brainwashed brother...

"Yo man, it sounds like you're selling out to me, ‘cause I'm from the ghetto; I lived in the ghetto all my life!
We ain't supposed to leave here! We're black! We're supposed to be poor!"

Shut up! Do you know how dumb you sound?
That mentality's  what keeps my people down!
No one wants to live in an urban war
You live there cause your parents were poor
They live there because theirs were also
Get yourself together, hit the gates bro!

[Hook]
Ya gotta get out! Ya gotta get out! Why?
Ya gotta get out! Ya gotta get out! Why?
Ya gotta get out! Ya gotta get out! Why?
‘Cause the fields are where you die!
I escaped from the killing fields!
I escaped from the killing fields!

You try to keep us running and running faster
But I ain't runnin' from ya; I'm runnin' at ya!
And my posse's thick, about a mil strong
Too late to make up now, cause it's on
I'm the one that's got ya in constant fear
I'm the nigga ya shoulda killed last year
But you played yourself: you let me gain wealth
Now I can change the way the cards are dealt!
I've schooled my homeboys, made 'em all understand
The tricks and twists inflicted on the Black man
How ya make me think to be down
I gotta stay around
Down in the motherfuckin' battleground

"We got the Puerto Ricans where we want 'em, we got the Mexicans and the Blacks where we want 'em... Well, shit, they're all Black! We gotta keep 'em together, the same way we got those fuckin' Indians!"

There'll never be any good schools in the hood
There'll never be any cops that are any good!
The hospital is a great place to go to die
Real estate's cheap, let me tell ya why
The man's got a sure fire system:
A economic prison!

[Hook]

I escaped from the killing fields!
Brainstorm microphone napalm
This is it, words from a timebomb
Attack speed, fast as an F15
Raise the heat, light the gasoline
Overload, it might cause a blackout
Dead end
There's no chance to back out
Hit the tripwire
Duck from the gunfire
Broken glass, screechin' car tires, bodies hit the deck
As I commence to wreck
Eject another clip and drip sweat
Face of danger, increasin' anger
Point blank
I smoke another stranger
Grip the mic tight
I see the brake lights
Hit the back door
I lay down cross the floor
E's on the wheels
He makes the rubber squeal
Blood's on my gear
From caps I've peeled
About a block away I sit up
Look back
It wasn't nothin' but a
Microphone contract!
Dressed in black I stalk my prey
Parabellum in a leather attache
Low tones I speak, I speak to few
Just give me the money
And who the fuck to do
Four blocks away my aim's clean
Night scope on a silence carbine
Place my crosshairs on my vic's eye
Squeeze the trigger
Watch the brains fly
Violent? Yeah you could call me that
Insane? You're on the right track
But turn the sounds up
So I can stay amped
Do another crew and break camp
The only way I sleep is in a cold sweat
You think I'm crazy?
You ain't see shit yet
Cause I live to kill and kill for fun
The microphone it goes off
Like a handgun
It's goin' down now
Grab your girl hops
No excuses when the bodies
Begin to drop
Look in my face fool
It look like I'm play'n
Don't become another
Victim of mic slayin'
What's up?
You want your feet in some concrete?
I got some brothers
That'll do you for gold teeth
But most the time I move, I move alone
Take a bat
Break your motherfuckin' dome
Shoot you dead in the face
With a sawed off
One hundred ten degrees
Ice don't get soft
Cause I'm hard as they come
I come correct
You can't handle the vandal hit eject
If not you better get
Out my face sucka
Or else you better be
A good bullet ducker
Cause I'm a rip shop
Tell that ass drop
Five o Ice, yo fuck a damn cop!
Cause I move hard and cold
With a gangster stroll
Five thousand dollar suits
And fly gold
Rolex, you can't fit no more
Diamonds on it
Pinky ring, worth a house
If I decide to pawn it
What's up now punk?
Yo start to choke up?
You try to move on the Ice
You'll get broke up!
Midnight, time for a homicide
Showtime, somebody's gonna die
E hits the switch
And thouands of volts connect
With the weapon that's in my fist
I see a sucka in the third row
Try'n to riff
A paragraph and a half he's stiff
I start bustin' off barrages ear high
Mothers grab for their children
Tears fly
I'm like a psycho
When the microphone's on
Speakers blown, mind gone
I can't be touched
Once my lyrics begin to fly
Simple stage radiation
Could make ya die
Ya got a problem nigga?
You think your rep's bigger?
Hold your head right there
While I squeeze the trigger
Cause I'm a crazy motherfucker
That's no joke
My favorite smell is
The aroma of gunsmoke
I'm bustin' off another
Lyrical nightmare
Parents hate the Ice!
You think that I care?
Well I don't give a fuck
Cause I rhyme tough
Drop science, still bust the ill stuff
So now it's time for crime
And the rhyme is mine
Track the movement
Hide from the punchline
I rhyme with quickness
Microphone fitness
The assassinator
Stay off the shit list
Let me tell ya a little story
'Bout my homeboy Ed
Use to drink every day
Straight 40's to the head
You try to snap on him
He'd ask, "What, you said?"
You still try to break
He'd start givin' up lead
Love to gamble
And on one knee he stayed
Tryin' to hit seven
And all night he played
Worked tees and weights
So he always got paid
Blew on the hoes
Every dollar he made
Crazy friends, crazy friends he had
Superfly 'drobe, super dope pad
Cars for your ass
And I'm talkin'  about class
Benzes embedded
With his name on the dash
One night he got drunk
And started drivin' real fast...
Ed's dead
Upon initial contact with Ice-T's music, I had envisioned him to be an ill-mannered and psychologically unstable man with an extremely uneducated and barbaric frame of mind, whose raps displayed nothing but ridiculous jargon, shocking sexual audacity, and repulsive images of the ghetto

However, after further analysis of his music I can deduce that he is the epitome of antidisestablishmentarianism who embodies the entire spectrum of the urban experience and struggle

But to make things more plain and simple to the layman, I find Ice-T to be the dopest, flyest, O.G., pimp, hustler, gangster, player, hardcore motherfucker living today

To be honest, I'm totally and completely on his dick

[Evil E]
Yo Ice man, we halfway done with the album man
You be throwin all this strong, dope, stupid fly pimp shit
But what's up with the sex rhymes man?
You ain't throw no sex rhymes yet man, whassup with that?

[Ice-T]
Yo man, I didn't even wanna really do nothing this year man

[Evil E]
Yo why you ain't wanna do nuttin man?
Titties man~! Sex sex sex man, all that
We need some sex

[Ice-T]
{*laughing*} Man I wasn't really about that homes
Y'know I..

[Evil E]
C'mon man! Just throw one sex joint man
For me and my boys man, me and my man
The niggas man, WHASSUP!

[Ice-T]
Aight aight aight check this out E, check this out
The other night I was out at the club aight?
(Uh-huh, what happened what happened?)
I met this FLY-ASS freak, crazy fly
(Word, she was dope?) Dope, had BIG ol' titties aight
(Ohh shit, BIG titties!)
Crazy titties and a BIG ol' ass right?
(Ohhh shit.. what happened?)

I FUCKED HER
Midnight chillin' at A.M P.M
Coolin' drinkin' apple juice
In Evil's BM
The sound's up loud
To attract attention
Armor All-ed tires
On a lowered suspension
Nardi to steer with
Alpine deck was glowin'
Bumpin' Big Daddy
And the nigga was definitely flowin'
I was ridin' shotgun
Donald and Hen in back
Look through the tint recognized a jack
Two brothers strolled up
Talkin' 'bout "Get out"
Donald D blazed
Shot one fool thru his fuckin' mouth
Why would they step
When they know we're strapped?
I never cruise L.A
Without a gat in my lap
The other fool shot
Caught the E in the shoulder blade
I busted through the car door
That's where the nigga laid
Hen jumped out
Dropped two nines in his forehead
Evil was bleedin' bad
The car seats were turnin' red
Looked to my left
There were two more carloads
Niggas in hats and hoods
In an attack mode
And they hadn't yet begun to fight
E hit the gas
It was one past midnight!
"Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang!"
"Take you on a walk through hell"
"South Central"
Yo, E, drive, drive, drive, man, drive, fuck it, let's get the fuck outta here, man!

We boned down Vernon
Made a right on Normandie
Left on Florence
Gettin' through the E.T.G.'s
Spun out on Vermont
Made a left on Colden
Right on Hoover
"E, where we goin'?"
He didn't even answer that
Checked the rear view
They were still out back
Where were these brothers from?
What made these brothers come?
Bang! Our back window
Was removed by a shotgun
Now Hen G was shot
Don caught a ricochet
These motherfuckers was ill
They didn't come to play
Bust a right turn, parked
And then we got left
Hid in the the bushes
Shot the gas tank to fake death
But would this really
Keep them psyched?
Three of us bleedin'
It was ten past midnight!
"Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang!"
"Midnight, time for a homicide"
"South Central"
Come on, man, y'all bleeding bad, man, you gotta keep up, man, we can't stop here!

I really didn't like
How this shit was goin' down
Wrong night, wrong time
Wrong fuckin' part of town
Ya see we was deep
In the Hoover's hood
Three niggas bleedin'
That shit don't look good!
See over there red don't go
Some places red's all they know
But not our luck
Tonight we was real fucked
Broke down an alley
And we instantly had to duck
Fuckin' police on a gang sweep
No time to deal with one time
So we had to creep
Broke through a back yard
Ran through a vacant lot
E, Hen and Don kept up
To be some niggas shot
Shit was gettin' crazy
So I had to get busy
Hen was bleedin' worse
And Evil was gettin' dizzy
Looked in a parking lot
I needed a snatch bar
Had to hot wire
So I moved on an old car
It was a bucket, but fuck it, it had to do
Started it up
And scooped my whole crew
Two blocks later
We saw fuckin' blue lights
The pigs were behind us
It was half past midnight!
"Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang!"
"Take you on a walk through hell"
"South Central"
Y'all just lay down on the floor of this car, fuck the police, man, i'mma handle this

When they pulled us over
Shit got worse
I waited till they got out
And then I hit reverse
Fucked 'em up, I seen one cop fall
Threw it in gear, yo I'm outty y'all
Don't know how
But somehow we got away
Lost the jackers, the cops
Dumped the G.T.A
Made it back to the hood
Fixed the crew up
And even though Evil's car blew up
We made it home and then I crashed out
Thinkin' bout my all-night death bout
Then somethin' woke me up
From my dark sleep
The sound of fuckin' police
When they're tryin' to creep
Broke through my door
With no goddamn warning
Looked at my watch
It was six in the mornin'
It's been a long while
Since I hit you with freestyle
High tech selections
From the vaults of the Ice files
Kick back relax
And watch as I melt wax
Don't ever let a brother like me
Write a dope track
Cause once I hit it with the vocal tone
It's mine, have motherfuckers
Rushing to rewind
Cause I'll flow slow
And still twist your tongues up
Rock the house from night
Till the sun's up
Cause it really ain't
How much you say
It's what you say
I got no fucking time on the mic
To play
I write rhymes
With addition and algebra
Mental geometry
Don't even come at me
Talking that weak and
Popping that bullshit
Get out my face
A fool could get his head split
A lot of doubters
Said it couldn't be done by me
Them same suckers
Are now looking from under me
Wondering what I did
I didn't play myself kid
I respected my fans
And made the high bid
Sometimes I write my rhymes
At night and fall asleep
Wake up with new techniques
Grab the pen
And place it on some loose leaf
Nothing soft, always the tough meat
The white paper and
Blue lines excite my mind
Not allowing me to stop the rhyme
Until the whole motherfucking
Book's complete
Then I write on the
Back of the sheets
I made a promise
To my brothers in street crime
We'd get paid with the use
Of a sweet rhyme
We put our minds together
Made the tracks clever
Now we're checking
More bank than ever

[Hook]
Mind over matter
(So you gotta have mind power, like the fellas say)
Mind over matter
(Mind power)

I can drop rhymes in twos
And threes and fours
And still have much shit
Left for encores
Cause once my mind locks
In on a dope idea
Motherfucking ducks
Should stand clear
Cause I'm a hit the topic point blank
It's jail ya better keep your shank
Cause I got mine
And I'm out on a solo creep
(Uggga!) Your face hits the concrete
You wanna roll
With the niggas that don't play
I think you got false courage
Get out my damn way
Cause the car I'm in
Is rolling full of men
Not kids or boys, E got the Mac 10
Islam's got the Zulu Nation back up
DJ Aladdin to
Hook the fucking track up
Syndicate's making the move
With the ski masks
And I'm housing the long cash
So now you realize
You underestimated the Ice
You thought that I was OK
But now you realize I'm nice
But that's alright
Cause I knew I'd make it in the end
Those who like me now
Might not have liked me then
But I'mma keep impressing
Stressing my lesson
And keep motherfuckers guessing
Armor plate my mind
With walls and shields
As I escape from the killing fields

[Hook]
(I can understand)
Mind over matter
(I know what it means)
(Mind power)
Mind over matter
(Mind over matter)
Mind over matter
(Mind over matter)
Mind over matter
(Mind over matter)

Wise up
Move to the tempo of this hype groove
You know this shit is dope
So what you trying to prove
VU's max as Evil E
My nigga dogs the wax
My brain's a hand grenade--catch
I'mma hit you with an overload
Of bottomless thought
Reversing all the shit you're taught
Then throw words at you
Syl-la-ble-at-a-time
Your brain recites the rhyme
No matter what you do
The power's over you
When you sleep
You'll be saying these rhymes too
Cause the brain has the power
To control all
Think positive
You'll be unable to fall
Brain cells swell
Thought process becomes a trance
Makes you feel possessed to dance
I'll say I want a million
My mind is so deep
I'll be busting a check for it next week

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Hustler, word, I pull the trigger long
Grit my teeth, spray till every nigga's gone
Got my block sewn, armored dope spots
Last thing I sweat's a sucka punk cop
Move like a king when I roll, hops
You try to flex, bang, another nigga drops
You gotta deal with this cause there's no way out
Why? Cash money ain't never gonna play out
I got nothin to lose, much to gain
In my brain, I got a capitalist migraine
I gotta get paid tonight, you muthafuckin right
Pickin' my grip, check my bitch, keep my game tight
So many hoes on my jock, think I'm a movie star
Nineteen, I got a fifty thousand dollar car
Go to school, I ain't goin for it
Kiss my ass, bust the cap on the Moet
Cause I don't wanna hear that crap
Why? I'd rather be a New Jack... Hustler

[Chorus]
Hustler
Hustler
Hustler
H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler

[Interlude: Kid drop in]
Yo man you know what I'm sayin?
You got it goin on my man, I like how it's goin down
You got the fly cars, the girls, the jewels
Look at that ring right there

Man, you the flyest nigga I seen in my life!
Yo man, I just wanna roll with you man
How can I be down?

[Verse 2: Ice-T]
What's up? You say you wanna be down?
Ease back, or motherfucker get beat down
Out my face, fool I'm the illest
Bulletproof, I die harder than Bruce Willis
Got my crew in effect, I bought em new Jags
So much cash, gotta keep it in Hefty bags
All I think about is keys and Gs
Imagine that, me workin at Mickey D's (ha ha ha ha)
That's a joke cause I'm never gonna be broke
When I die there'll be bullets and gun smoke
Ya don't like my lifestyle? Fuck you!
I'm rollin with the New Jack crew
And I'm a hustler

[Chorus]
H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler
New Jack, New Jack..........

[Verse 3: Ice-T]
Here I come, so you better break North
As I stride, my gold chains glide back and forth
I care nothing 'bout you, and that's evident
All I love's my dope and dead presidents
Sound crazy? Well it isn't
The ends justifies the means, that's the system
I learned that in school then I dropped out
Hit the streets, checked a grip, and now I got clout
I had nothing, and I wanted it
You had everything, and you flaunted it
Turned the needy into the greedy
With cocaine, my success came speedy
Got me twisted, jammed into a paradox
Every dollar I get, another brother drops
Maybe that's the plan, and I don't understand
God damn----you got me sinkin in quicksand
But since I don't know, and I ain't never learned
I gotta get paid, I got money to earn
With my posse, out on the ave
Bump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh
Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam
Is this a nightmare? Or the American dream?
So think twice if you're coming down my block
You wanna journey through hell? Well shit gets hot
Pregnant teens, children's screams
Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam
You don't come here much, and ya better not
Wrong move (bang), ambulance cot
I gotta get more money than you got
So what, if some motherfucker gets shot?
That's how the game is played
Another brother slayed, the wound is deep
But they're givin us a band aid
My education's low but I got long dough
I'm raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro
Sleep on silk, lie like a politician
My Uzi's my best friend, cold as a mortician
Lock me up, it's genocidal catastrophe
There'll be another one after me!
A hustler, hustler

[Chorus]
H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler
New Jack, New Jack......

[Verse 1]
It's eight a.m. I roll out my silk sheets
Get fly crash the limo back seats
Lookin' in the faces of some ladies that I never met
On the interview tip, no sweat
They ask me questions, I throw the words back
They say they write facts, I know that's bull crap
They're kickin' drama but then drama's my middle name
That's the price ya pay for big fame
The cellular phone rings, don't wanta pick it up
But it's my J-O-B I gotta kick it up
Another damn reporter on the line with a word quiz
I gotta show cause I'm livin' in showbiz
Out the limo, to the plane, in the pourin' rain
I hate flyin' but there's no time for slow trains
Another show to do, I gotta catch my crew
They left last night in the bus around two
The plane's a small one - No fun at all
Bouncin' round the air like a tennis ball
When it touches down I wanna kiss the ground
But it's time to wreck a new town
Get to the arena, meet up with the crew
They tell me all the speakers blew
The cordless don't work, sound man's a jerk
Somebody's gonna get hurt
I'm crazy mad but my fans want autographs
I turn my angry frowns into fake laughs
I can't be rude 'cause they wouldn't understand
I ain't human no more, I'm a superman

[Hook]
You can try
But you'll never understand this
You can try
But you'll never understand this
You can try
But you'll never understand this
The lifestyles of the rich and infamous

[Verse 2]
Four hours 'til show time oh well
I might as well check in the hotel
Get a little rest before it's time for us to play
Ten brothers standin' in the hallway
All with demo tapes, they need the hook up
They heard that I was the one to look up
I can't ditch 'em 'cause they already saw me
I'll put my head down, maybe they'll ignore me
No chance - "Ice what's goin' on?"
I listened to twenty-five songs
And after that the brothers still wouldn't leave
They started lookin' at my T.V
I was gonna break down if they didn't jet soon
Snuck across the hall and crashed in E's room
But then this freak came in, thought I was E
Straddled her legs across me
Ripped off her blouse, pushed her breast against my face
Started gyrating her waist
Sounds fly, like a hype sex thriller?
But see, she looked like Godzilla
Pushed her off me, homegirl hit the floor
This is what it's like on tour
I hit the hallway it was crawlin' thick
"Could weez take ya picture real quick?"
Jumped into a pose that I used a million times before
Took pictures with the whole damn floor
I couldn't say no, not to my fans
You see, they wouldn't understand

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now it's show time, "time to flow" time
"Evil lost the records but we still gotta go" time
The house is packed, everybody's on their feet
So I say, "Throw on Rakim's beat."
E hits the fader and the crowd is lit
I start bustin' off some new shit
The stage is so smoky that I almost fall off
I start inhalin' it, I'm tryin' not to cough
I'm catchin' problems from every angle
The mic cords are tangled
I try to flow smooth but my words are mangled
Damn near slipped and broke my ankle
If that ain't enough the police are hawkin'
Listenin' real close to the words I'm talkin'
They wanna put a brother like me in the back seat
Just because I curse the beat
They wanna tap my phone, wanna keep my crib bugged
Call all my homies felons and street thugs
You might say i think this lifestyle sucks?
I wouldn't trade it for a million bucks
Although it's all not glamour and gleam
It's still my dream

[Hook]

[Intro: Donald D Talking]
One, two in the place to be, I'm MC Donald D
And in the house Nat the Cat, the Syndicate Mobb boss
And standing after me, Ice-T the O.G. Gangster
Syndicate is about to jump off on a buckwild freestyle
Ice, drop some dope shit!!

[Ice-T]
Everybody step back from the mic cause I set it off
All playing the wall, it's time to sweat it off
Anybody with static, awww, please try
I'll do you like Godfather 3 and do a fly by
Time to rip and hit and strangle
I eat Guardian Angels
And toy emcees with their names on the front page
I bury in shallow graves
I don't rap with girls in my LP
I don't beg for pussy, I love the ladies and they love me right back
Now who's the mack?
Mission accomplished
I came to stomp this microphone and leave suckers unconscious
And if you think you got a 'S' in your chest
You better wear two vests
Watch your back, your front, I always hit, don't bunt
Crazy posse when I'm out on a duck hunt
Emcee Ice-T answers to no one
Load my rhymes and cock them like a shotgun
Let off like frags from a pipe bomb
A low stroll and my mic in my right palm
The cops hate me and that's right they oughta
Before my crew gets to their daughters

[Break: Ice-T Talking]
Ha ha ha, yo, Nat the Cat, you're next baby
Yo, why don't you get on this Mic
And jump off like suicider off the Brooklyn Bridge, baby?
Yeah, you're a player, kick it

[Nat the Cat]
Do you know me?
Right, that's why carry the mic
I'm not flashing my American Express
I'm playing my cards closed to my vest
My name that you say, what, I'm vesting
Listen up and listen close and listen for the lesson
Black panther resisting that situation
Executing with tact, jumping exact
Ripping up slack on the tack
86 didn't mack, turn tales and back up at stack the jack
Cause I'm venerish, Nat The Cat, unloading like the million tons of T.N.T
Yes that's me, you see, you wanna be but can't MC
Cause on the real, the science , the knowledge behind your capacity
The simplicity that's how I say
But I said it, you know you wonder how did he say that anyway
To you it's complex, when I flex for flex flood
Stimulates the opposite sets, and that's dope
Though why you can't cope
I'm throwing you a rope, I'm about to draw you as you don't rock the boat
Or you be back inside the ocean this time it won't float
You be stuck on the bottom with other suckers I got them
Sporting to see me, woof, while I'm banking the loot
Just off the end, you travel around the world in a fly silk suit
My style is custom made suede and leather
Down to fly by in any weather

[Donald D]
Donald D the smuggler, goin' for the juggler
Firing wild out here, police sirens
What's up? Do you wanna die by?
The Syndicate sniper tonight on a fly by
Swing while I came into the tune that grip ya
Flip ya, trip ya, rip ya, I keep dipping ya
In and out, back and forth, up and down
Me be sleeping with the heat, I can't fuck around
City sounds, I proceed with caution
Teach you that B.S.C.s another fortune
I'm here to sink your brain, I'll take the thought you think
Make you walk the plank, to watch you sink
The M.O.B needs a hitman
Well here I'm, Uncle Cocaine, floods your membrane
As the black ball swings from the chain
Learn to steal, learn to wheel and deal
When things got hot, caps got peeled
MC's, come on, step with your rhyme
What's up, put your life on the line
I shall robe them, headlock choke them
While you walk them when the Syndicte Sniper get stalk them
Red Beam on target, you can't dodge it
Wouldn't wanna be ya, ABC ya

[Outro: Donald D Talking]
Aww yeah man, that was MC Ice-T
Nat The Cat and Donald D, you know what I'm saying?
In your face for 1991 and did something
We outta here, for sure, it was a homicidal fly by
So peace to Syndicate's elders

[Verse 1]
Ten years ago I used to listen to rappers flow
Talkin' bout the way they rocked the mic at the disco
I liked how that shit was goin' down
Dreamt about ripping the mic with my own sound
So I tried to write rhymes something like them
My boys said, "That ain't you, Ice! That shit sounds like them."
So I sat back, thought up a new track
Didn't fantasize, kicked the pure facts
Motherfuckers got scared cause they was unprepared
Who would tell it how it really was? Who dared?
A motherfucker from the West Coast, L.A
South Central, fool, where the Crips and the Bloods play
When I wrote about parties, it didn't fit
"6 N' the Mornin," that was the real shit

[Hook]
O.G. Original Gangster

[Verse 2]
When I wrote about parties, someone always died
When I tried to write happy, yo, I knew I lied
'Cause, I lived a life of crime Why play ya blind?
A simple look and anyone with two cents would know I'm
A hardcore player from the streets
Rapping bout hardcore topics over hardcore drum beats
A little different than the average though
Jet you through the fast lane, drop ya on death row
Cause anybody who's been there knows that
Life ain't so lovely on the blood-soaked fast track
That invincible shit don't work
Throw ya in a joint, you'll be coming out feet first
So I blast the mic with my style
Sometimes I'm ill and other times buckwild
But the science is always there
I'd be a true sucker if I acted like I didn't care
I rap for brothers just like myself
Dazed by the game in a quest for extreme wealth
But I kick it to you hard and real
One wrong move, and your cap's peeled
I ain't no super hero, I ain't no Marvel comic
But when it comes to game I'm atomic
At dropping it straight, point blank and untwisted
No imagination needed, cause I lived it
This ain't no fucking joke, this shit is real to me
I'm Ice-T, O.G

[Hook}

[Verse 3]
Two weeks ago I was out at the disco
Two brothers stepped up to me and said, "Hey yo, Ice
We don't think you're down. What set ya claiming?"
E drew the Glock, yo my set's aiming!
Dumb motherfucker, try to roll on me, please!
I'm protected by a thousand emcees
And hoodlums and hustlers and bangers with jheri curls
We won't even count the girls
Cause they got my back and I got theirs too
Fight for the streets when I'm on Oprah or Donahue
They try to sweat a nigga but they just didn't figure
That my wit's as quick as a hair trigger
"He's not your everyday-type prankster."
I'm Ice-T, the original gangster

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
So step to me if you think that you're ready to
Got on your bullet proof? Well mine's going right thru
This ain't no game to me, it's hollow fame to me
Without respect from streets, so I don't claim be
The hardest motherfucker on earth
Catch me slipping, I can't even get worked
But I don't slip that often, there's a coffin
Waiting for the brother who comes off soft when
The real fucking shit goes down, take a look around
All them pussies can be found
They talk a mean fight but fight like hoes
I'm from South Central, fool, where everything goes
Snatch you out your car so fast you'll get whiplash
Numbers on your rooftop for when the copters pass
Gangbangers don't carry no switchblades
Every kid's got a Tec 9 or a hand grenade
Thirty-seven killed last week in a crack war
Hostages tied up and shot in the liquor store
Nobody gives a fuck
"The children have to go to school!" Well, moms, good luck!
Cause the shit's fucked up bad I use my pad and pen
And my lyrics break out mad
I try to write about fun and the good times
But the pen yanks away and explodes and destroys the rhyme
Maybe it's just cause of where I'm from
L.A. (*bang!*) that was a shotgun!

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Just checkin' my microphone once as I test your audio
Increase the bass response, hopin' the speakers blow
I got no time to sit and flip, and pop bullshit
Turn up your stereo hops, insert the rhyme clip
Close your windows up, make sure it's airtight
E.Q. the track exact, so shit sounds right
I rhyme of death and darkness and danger
Your crib or car becomes a torture chamber
I lace my rhymes with violence, what you expect
Sounds of pain, the snap of a broken neck
All alone in darkness I sit each night
Write my rhymes with blood upon a butcher knife
You say the Ice is ill, and ill I am
They try to ban my shit and I don't give a damn
Roll up, your eye'll get swole up
Suckers who flexed, yo their deaths got tolled up, hold up
Plus I'm not the nigga to toy with, boy with the big mouth
Ya got time to riff, there's time to take you out
Put a couple caps in your ass, cut your head off
Send it to your moms with flowers 'cause I'm so soft
Lay on your wack crew, smoke the whole bunch
Bury 'em in my backyard and then I'll eat lunch
'Cause I don't give a fuck about you or him or her
Whenever I'm in the house a death just might occur
Is this real or fiction, you'll never know
While you're locked to the pulse of the rhyme flow

[Verse 2]
Once I lock you up, you can't get loose
You stuck your head inside and I placed the noose
The mic drip juice slow from its steel mesh
My words feel like hooks underneath your flesh
Makin' you twist and turn, scorch and burn
When will you learn, the '90s are my turn
To pitch a vocal fit, like the ultimate
Gangster rhyme, yo I invented the shit
Watch me do it, as I do it and I do it right
Grab the gauge, duct tape on the flashlight
Don the black ski mask and come to your house
Cut off your power and do you with the lights out
Is this real or fiction, well you'll never know
While you're locked to the pulse of the rhyme flow

[Verse 3]
A pool of blood and floatin' body parts would make me grin
A close view of a razor when it's breakin' skin
If you was burnin', I'd use gasoline to put you out
'Cause I walk alone and choose the dark route
Nightmares gotta be loved by some
And I'm the one, you wanna come, bring your shotgun
You ever seen your partner die, no, well I have
You ever seen your father die, no, well I have
You ever seen your mother die, no, well I have
So shut the fuck up punk, and clear the rhyme path
What would make me feel calm and nice
Is a slow slice through your jugular and windpipe
Throw me in jail, I won't even try to make bail
Put me in the gas chamber and watch me inhale
Is this true or false, well you'll never know
While you're locked to the pulse of the rhyme flow

[Verse 4]
Jason, Tales from the Crypt and the Darkside
Another fly murder, another suicide
Did these flicks have an influence on my brain
I really doubt that shit, I think that I was born insane
When I was young I had a lust for knives and guns
Use a magnifying glass to fry an ant with the Sun
And on and on my love for death got bigger
At fifteen I was placed behind a trigger
Although I'm dirty, not the one to be swept up
Step up, I'd love to open your chest up
I've got no concept of life or death
Placing my hands on your neck, all I want is your last breath
Give me a motherfuckin' break, I should behave
Give me a motherfuckin' shovel, I'll dig graves
I break ill in extra large portions
Where's your parents, I'll make you an orphan
So when you're talkin' crazy, you better think of me
The I, to the C, to the E, to the fuckin' T
There'll be no screams, no tears or cries
Just a laser beam between your fuckin' eyes
You feel strange, so now you know
That you're locked to the pulse of the rhyme flow
Yo check this out
A lot of people get mad cause I use the word nigga
You know what I'm saying they don't like the fact that I use the word nigga
They say you a black man I tell em I'm a nigga they don't understand that
So I'm a say what I wanna say I call myself what I wanna call myself
You know what I'm saying
So they can stay off my dick

Damn right I'm a nigga
And I don't care what you are
Cause I'm a capital N-I double-G-E-R
Black people might get mad
Cause they don't see
That they're looked upon
As a nigga just like me
I'm a nigga, not a Coloured man
Or a Black, or a Negro
Or Afro American, I'm all that
Yes I was born in America true
Does South Central
Look like America to you?
I'm a nigga, a straight up nigga
From a hard school
Whatever you are
I don't care, that is you fool
I'm loud and proud
Well endowed with the big beef
Out on the corner
I hang out like a horse thief
So you can call me dumb or crazy
Ignorant, stupid, inferior or lazy
Silly or foolish
But I'm badder and bigger
And most of all
I'm a straight up nigga
That's right I'm a nigga

My man Lord Finesse is my motherfucking nigga
You know Evil E's my nigga, Islam's my nigga
That's right they're my niggas

I'm a nigga in America
And that much I flaunt
Cause when I see what I like
Yo I take what I want
I'm not the only one
That's why I'm not bitter
Cause everybody is a nigga to a nigga!
America was stole from the Indians
Show and prove, what was that?
A straight up nigga move
A low down shame
Yo it's straight insane
Yet they complain
When a nigga snatch
Their gold chains
What is nigga suppose to do?
Wait around for a handout
From a nigga like you?
That's why a low down nigga gets hyped
But I'm not a nigga of that type
I'm a steak and lobster eatin'
Billionaire meetin'
Cash money makin', movin' shakin'
Corporate jet glidin'
Limousine ridin'
Writin' hits, filthy rich
Straight up nigga!
That's right I'm a nigga

Now I'm a write this song
Though the radio won't play it
But I got freedom of speech
So I'm a say it
She wanna be lez he wanna be gay
Well that's your business, I'm straight
So nigga have it your way
Those who hate me I got somethin' for ya
I'm a nigga with cash; a nigga with a lawyer
Not a watermelon chitlin eatin' nigga down south
But a nigga that'll smack the taste from your mouth
A contemplating thinking best champagne drinkin'
Ten inch givin' extra large livin'
Mercedes benz' drivin' strivin' to survivin
All the way live n' and kickin' hi fivin'
Strokin' rap and happenin' deal doing
Fly in from Cali to chill with the crew in
Rhymin' groovin' fly girlie grabbin'
Horny gun shootin' long hair havin'
Nigga
Straight up nigga
Nigga
Straight up nigga
Nigga
Nigga that's right fool look at me
Just the kinda nigga you'd like to hang from a tree
But all you KKK type grave diggers
Ease back fool cause I'm a trigger nigga
I work real hard for my livin
But I don't celebrate bullshit Thanksgiving
Sit up like some fool and eat turkey
That's the day your forefathers jerked me
Shipped us all over here in locks and chains
Split us up twisted up a nigga's brain
Now you keep me in constant sweat
But I'm a nigga that you'll never forget
A black bad iron clad always mad
Fly nigga takin' off from a helipad
Rolex drivin' buck wilin' cash pilin'
Sportin' link chains and medallions
Intellectual hi-tech cashin' seven digit checks
And still breakin' necks
The ultimate male supreme white woman's dream
Big dick straight up nigga
Watch me flip and rip on the freedom tip
Open your mind see the point of the ice pick
I stand tall while my brothers still choose to crawl
Black power, it's in effect y'all
But you don't understand you're still a slave to the man
Prepare for revolution
Some suckers say we're free, I gotta disagree
Half my posse's in the penitentiary
So I'm a drop and kick the science with defiance
Because I have no alliance
With suckas who choose not to act Black when they are Black
Get out my face with that, you better ease back
Cause Mandela did 27 hard ones
Not in a windowed room, but in a barred one
While his wife had tears in her eyes
The man is a hero, he needs a Nobel Prize
But that will never happen, so I'm gonna keep rappin'
Freein' my brothers' minds from their entrapment
To silence the Ice, they'll probably put a bullet in me
But I'm prepared to die and Mandela's free!
You know the house down the street
Where the kids are
And every day
They seem to have a new scar
Something strange is going on
And everybody knows
Doors always shut
Windows always closed
The little girl had a burn
The boy was black and blue
They said it came from play
You know that shit ain't true
The boy's arm's broke
Girl's scared to speak
Their parents drink all day
Couple of dead beats
Some days they go to school
And other days they might
It's hard to stay awake
After you cry all night
You see 'em every day
Tear tracks on their cheeks
But they will never tell
It goes on weeks and weeks
(But what can they do?
They're only children man!)
You ain't no fuckin' kid
Act like you give a damn!
Won't someone save these kids
Do something, call a cop

The other night I heard gun shots
I'm rollin' up in a big gray bus
And I'm shackled down
Myself that's who I trust
The minute I arrived
Some sucker got hit
Shanked ten times
Behind some bullshit
Word in the pen the fool was a snitch
So without hesitatin'
I made a weapon quick
If found a sharp piece of metal
Taped it to a stick
Then a bullhorn sounds
That means it's time for chow
My first prison meal
The whole feeling was foul
It wasn't quite my style
But my stomach growled
So I washed the shit down
And hit the weight pile
The brothers was swole
The attitudes was cold
Felt the tension on the yard
From the young and the old
But I'm a warrior
I got my ground to hold
So I studied the inmates
To see who had the power
The Whites? The Blacks?
Or just the gun tower!
In a blink of an eye, a riot broke out
Blacks put their backs to the wall
Cause it was north and south
A gun man shouts
And everybody had doubt
Until the bullets started fly'n
Took two men out
Then they rushed everybody
Back to their cells
Damn the pen is different than
The county jail
I'm in a one man cell
I know my life's on a scale
I wonder if that gunman is goin' to hell
This is my second day
I got a ten year stay
I learned my first lesson
In the pen you don't plaay
I saw a brother kill another
Cause he said he was gay
But that's the way it is
It been that way for years
And when his body hit the ground
I heard a couple of cheers
It kind of hurt me inside
That they were glad he died
And I ask myself
Just who had the power?
The Whites? The Blacks?
Or just the gun tower!
You see the Whites got a thing
The call White pride
The Blacks got the muscle
Mexicans got the knives
You better be wise
You wanna stay alive
Go toe to toe with a sucka
No matter wht size
A fool tried to sweat me
Act'n like he was hard
I stuck him twice in the neck
And left him dead in the yard
It was smooth how I did it
Cause nobody could see
With my jacket on my arm
And my knife on the side of me
Bam bam, it was over
Another one bites the dust
I went crazy in the pen
With nobody to trust
Bench'n ten quarters, so I'm hard to sweat
Used a tat gun, and engrved my set
They call me a lifer
Cause I'm good as dead
I live in the hole, so the floor's my bed
And I ask myself again
Who has the power
The Whites? The Blacks?
Or just the gun tower
Stick up, hands in the air
You move, you lose 'cause the Ice don't care
No chance to run, don't shout
Flinch an inch I'm gonna take you out
Grand Larcenist, soloist, felonist, vocalist
Crime's my rhyme, but here's a new twist
I ain't here for your gold, bro
All I want is the show
This is Grand Larceny

This is Grand Larceny
This is Grand Larceny
This is Grand Larceny

I lay low for a show, and then I go
Steal the motherfucker, then we count the dough
It's kinda like robbin', but it's legally done
And nowadays if it ain't legal I don't fuck around
I get a thrills when I ill and a jam is filled
With 10,000 screamin' people, now that's the pill
Who's gonna dog the set? The Ice will
And once I'm in effect it's overkill
Kinda like a hold-up, all the tickets sold up
And then the black stretch limo cold rolls up
And then the posse breaks, high off the Cold Duck
And then I set the mic to show destruct
Even if we open up, that don't mean nothing
I rock the rhymes, E does the cuttin'
Call it show-nappin', I take a hostage at night
Do shit and break out on the next flight
This is Grand Larceny
Grand Larceny

I'm a kleptomaniac when a jam is packed
You can fight all night, but you'll still get jacked
By the show stealer, crime rhyme dealer
Rap kingpin, L.A. big-wheeler
Got a posse so strong they could lift a tank, rob a bank
But now we steal shows, the cops say thanks
Breathe easy 'cause the Syndicate deep
Before we start rappin'
They got no sleep
This is Grand Larceny

Grand Larceny

Just give me a beat, give me a stage to stand on
I know that none y'all ever planned on
A dude from L.A. who could rock shit this way
Have his record go gold, with no radio play
But it happened, the Ice is rappin'
Just listen to my fans that are clappin'
Or come to my show,sit in the front row
And watch me steal the motherfucker before your ass can say "ho"
I'm like a time bomb, but I'm a rhyme bomb
Spray the whole audience with napalm
Or something just as hot, I'll bust a rhyme, why not?
Rap hittin' so hard, you'll think you shot
I'll take a show and abduct it
Stone cold house it, and if it gets wild
With gasoline I'll douse it
Set it ablaze, and then I'll stomp it out
Many burnt emcees know what I'm talkin' about
This is Grand Larceny
Promoters on my tail now
Cause they billed me low
Here I am 'bout to steal another show
So they turn my mic down
Fuck up my audio sound
But too late, we just dogged another town
Rappin' like a Mac 10, as soon as I begin
The only way to stop the stealin' is throwin me in the pen
But that will never happen 'cause I'm just cool rappin'
My Larceny is legal, so sorry Captain
I would never steal a style or would ever steal a rap
But I'll steal a show in a minute, it's as simple as that
An interstate crook, my pistol's my rhyme book
Any show that I'm on is a show that's took
Better watch my left hook, or your jaw will get shook
If my posse gets mad, it's best you book
From the Grand Larcenist, Ice-T is my name
Got a rap like a mac, and a game the same

This is Grand Larceny
This is Grand Larceny
This is Grand Larceny

[Intro]
And the guitar's on there?
Do this (do this, do this)

[Verse 1]
Emcee's no time out, it's time to rhyme out
You dug your own grave, now you must climb out
Dig out, crawl out, hide from the fallout
'Cause when I get mad, I go all out
Ice, cooler than the coldest cube, dude
And when I'm micin', boy, I'm known to get rude
Criminal background,it's time to get down
I use a silencer, don't like the loud sound
Of my mic blast, you better run fast
The last punk that popped junk passed
Spit on his grave, laughed, jumped in my stretch
Signed his bitch an autograph
Syndicate boy, I don't fool out
You're full grown, school's out
You try to diss? I think you better cool out
'Cause your butt is smoke, if we ever duel out
This jam is directed to all of those who expected
For me to cold be rejected, but now I'm highly respected
And now their ears are infected with dollar signs I collected
Jealous punks, I said it!

[Chorus]
Take it personal
Personal, personal

[Verse 2]
Take it personal, punk, I'm talkin' to you
And if they agree with you, then your crew too
I never diss an emcee, I wish 'em all good luck
But if you diss me to my face, duck
My style don't ramble, you shouldn't gamble
With your grill, I got a fist like an anvil
I write a record, lock it on the topic
Evil and Iz dog the track, then we drop it
Record stores rock it, stock it, fans buy it
People that never heard of Ice-T, try it
Then you try to diss? You got gall
I got gold on my neck and gold on my wall
Gold in my fingers, gold in my ear
When this jam's spinnin', gold's what you hear
Toy, this ain't Christimas, no time to play
I ain't no child,punk,you'll get sprayed
Illin' on a mega-villain
You must want a pine box to go chill in
Buried deep, creep, no one will weep
'Cause the next night, with your bitch I'll sleep

[Chorus]
Take it personal
Personal, personal

[Verse 3]
I ain't East Coast, West Coast, new style, or old style
You wanna know about me? Check police files
Get out my face or you might have a bruised one
Brass knuckle prints? Yes, I used some
I ain't here to boast, I don't do that
When I talk it's straight dope, pure facts
I rock hard but still called a new jack
But talk shit, you're sure to get head-cracked
I don't drink or smoke or do dumb drugs
But my posse's still labeled street thugs
LAPD's got all my boy's mugs
Can't use my phone for the damn bugs
I live in privacy, don't like suckers hawking me
News reporters, some think they can talk for me
Lies, misquotes, changin' all my words around
But if I catch 'em on the street, they'll get beat down
They get money for hype-type publicity
They don't think twice about dissin' me
But that's a mistake, with the Syndicate you shouldn't mess
I hope those punk reporters wear vests

[Chorus]
Take that personal
Personal, personal

Now the words I speak to some may sound radical
But I'll explain, it's simply mathematical
You diss, I diss, this is creates an equal
You reply to my diss, this is called a sequel
I reply to your diss, this is called a battle
Not intelligent, not very adult
So I don't battle, I just put heads out
A straight line is always the direct route
I write lyrics clear to leave no doubt
Don't even have to say who I'm speakin' about
You know who you are, you just jealous
'Cause you hear my records are million sellers
Try to say I'm wack out on the streets
While your whole crew is jockin' my beats
See me on TV and in the papers
See me at a jam, catch vapors!

[Chorus]
Personal
This shit is personal
Personal, personal, personal

[Outro]
Personal
Once again, my friends, it's time to rock it till the party ends
Rhymin' with timin', while EVIL E lets the record spin
Kickin' it, hittin', rockin', just so dope it's shockin'
Because I be layin' rhymes super sly, 'cause this is do or die
Make it or break it, although most emcees do fake it
I'll say the ICE can't take it, time to microphone bake it
Raise the heatin' level, break out your coal shovel
Pump the temp, I'm sweatin' like a devil
Listen to my heartbeat, it's beatin' like a wild man
But that's natural, cause you know that I am
No punk, no chump, no fool, no toy
Try to get ill and serve you, boy

I'm on a hype tip, this ain't no ego trip
Just rollin' thick as hell, champagne I sip as well
Listen and you'll envision, this rap's metabolism
I think the beat is dope, but it's still your decision
Whether to turn it on, turn it off
Turn it up, make it loud, make it soft
EQ me with new frequencies or
Just rewind me till the tape bleeds
My heartbeat's kickin' like a saturday movie
Some say it's def, some say it's groovy
I say it's fly, you know why?
Because it's spoken by the brother, whose name is spent with the "I"
The C-E-T., Cold Chillin' rhyme villain on the M-I-C
With raps roarin', I'm never borin', I keep tourin'
My record sales keep soarin' and soarin'
I'll make a million, maybe two
Buy some rides, gold blow the dough on my crew
Wake up the next morning broke as hell
But not for long 'cause my records sell
My heartbeat's kickin' like a gunshot
Why not? That's who I made it for, the hard rocks
Better watch your gold when the posse breaks
Because what they want is what they take
But I'm coolin', I'm never foolin', too busy rulin'
Sucker emcees who need microphone schoolin'
Leave'em dazed, dogged, served and droolin'
By the playin' punk slayin' mac of microphone duelin'

Heartbeat (scratch freestyle)

This conglomeration is just a demonstration
Of rap's penetration to the core of our nation
Some rappers get down with toy commercial sounds
I had my choice, I chose the underground
Like me or hate me, now if you want you can rate me
My beats is by ISLAM, the cut's by the great E
My heartbeat is kickin', it's kickin' louder and louder
It's gettin' deffer and deffer, I'm feelin' prouder and prouder
Not robbin' or killin', just mic illin'
The phone rings, "WE MADE ANOTHER MILLION"
Break out the Dom and pop the corks
Catch a flight to New York
Hit the L.Q. watch RED spin, "IT'S CLOSED"
Brooklyn strikes again
Heartbeat (scratch)

Once again, my friends, it's time to rock it till the party ends
Rhymin' with timin', while EVIL E lets the record spin
Kickin' it, hittin', rockin', just so dope it's shockin'
Because I be layin' rhymes super sly, 'cause this is do or die
Make it or break it, although most emcees do fake it
I'll say the ICE can't take it, time to microphone bake it
Raise the heatin' level, break out your coal shovel
Pump the temp, I'm sweatin' like a devil
Listen to my heartbeat, it's beatin' like a wild man
But that's natural, 'cause you know that I am
No punk, no chump, no fool, no toy
Try to get ill and serve you

Boy(fade out)
Cruisin' for a bruisin', I'm takin' no crap
Pipe bomb in my trunk, got a nine in my lap
I'm layin' for a sprayin', tonight there's no playin'
The posse's most strapped, tonight the crew's weighin'
Dust is burnin', the steering wheel's turnin'
I'm out a week, I'm already earnin'
Suckers crossed, tonight it's their loss
Payback time, boy, life's the cost
Gauges out the window, one lay cross the roof
They all die if those suckers ain't bulletproof
I'm rollin' death tollin', of course the car's stolen
But I'm blind to what's wrong, all I want is what's golden
A fool in a fight, too dumb to know right
Fuckin' blue light, read 'em their rights

Drama (x4)

I copped an alias bailed out in an hour or less
I keep a bank for that don't know about the rest
Copped another piece, hit the dark streets
Rollin' once again, fuck the damn police
Called up my boy Joe, a roof job pro, 459 on his mind car stereos
He said the spot was sleek, he cased the joint a week
3 a.m. on the dot inside we creep
Got Alpines, Fishes, JVC's
Motorola Phones, Sony Color TV's
Had the ride packed up 'til we heard "Freeze"
Fuckin' blue lights, read 'em their rights
Drama (x4)

4 in the morning, lights in my face
That's the time, you know the place
Cuffed in the room with the two-way glass
Detects in effect cold doggin' my ass
"What's your date of birth?" "What's your real name?"
I stuck to my alias, I know the game
If they don't know who you are, then they don't know what you've done
"You're just makin' this harder on yourself, son"
I know this shit by heart, I'm too clever
"Have you ever been arrested before?" Nope, never
D.A. reject all over his face
You see, no confession, no case
Then my boy started illin', talkin' and tellin'
Son of a bitch, he was a snitch

Drama (x6)

Under I went, I caught a case and half
He dropped the mallet, then the judge laughed
Now I'm in the penzo, chillin' like a real pro
I can't move 'til the man says go
A puppet of the big game, an institutional thing
I wouldn't be here if I fed my brain
Got knowledge from school books, instead of street crooks
Now all I get is penitentiary hard looks
The joint is like an oven of caged heat
You're just a number, another piece of tough meat
Killers and robbers are all you greet
Act soft you will get beat
On death row they got their own hot seat
For those who feel that they are truly elite
The last thing you see's a priest
The lights dim, your life ends
Drama
Oh yeah, Ha ha ha, i'm back, motherfucker
Ice-T, 1991, fool
Told you, you shoulda killed me last year

Once again I'm back in the place to be
The I, the C, the E, the T
I'll never get a Grammy, so fuck the G
All I need is crowd, and my M-I-C
Got a gangster ass DJ named Evil E
My record label's called Warner B
William Morris is my agency
I'll never go broke, I got property
Got a dope pitbull named Felony
Got four gold albums, so what you tell'n me?
Power was two, Iceberg was three
This one here shipped five hundred G
Now when I roll, I roll stupid deep
Benzes, Beemers, and boomin' Jeeps
I'm always strapped 'cause my money I keep
You move on the Ice and you're goin' to sleep
But when you see me walkin' down the street
You say, "What's up Ice?" and I say, "Peace!"
You give me a dap, I give you one back
Cause I ain't souped so forget about that
We might take pictures, sign an autograph
Kick a little flavor, have some fun and laugh
But step to me wrong, you might get shot
And wind up lookin' out a ziploc
I'm livin' large as possible, posse unstoppable
Style topical, vividly optical
Listen, you'll see 'em sometimes I'll be 'em
Cops, critics and punks, never ever want to see me in POWER
Well, that's too bad, Apocalypse Now I'm back and I'm mad
We're comin', you're runnin' cold and cunning
Ice T on the mic, TopGunning
After your neck, checkin' respect, makin' you sweat
Rhyme Syndicate boy in effect
The rap motivator,teacher,talker,night rhyme stalker
Words thrillin', so real they're chillin', the hit author
Gettin' louder than a shot gun, you don't want none
RHYME PAYS was the name of the album
But that was number one, this is the number two
The posse grew, we're gonna break through

Power

Somebody line up the suckers who refuse to recognize the truth
Tie up the punks who refuse to understand the youth
My posse's growin' and it's gettin' larger every day
Detroit, Chi-Town, Pittsburgh, Houston, L.A
Come on, come on, come on, toys, let's play
Circle the calendar, perpetrator doomsday
ICE T fool man of my own full-grown
I cause havoc when I speak upon the microphone
I'm outspoken, no jokin', get in my face your jaw will get broken
Layin' it, sayin' it, then you're playing it
Lyrics so heavy that you might try weighin' it
Hated by many but I hate'em back
Loved by troopers who know where it's at
You might like me, might think I'm wack
But don't step to me cause the boy stays strapped
I'm taking no shorts, hatin' the courts, hatin' the judges
Punk DA's with their personal grudges
I hate the clubs that think with their butts
No hats, no jeans, no sneakers, no what?
No beepers, no gold? Yo kiss my ass
We'll wait and see who gets the last laugh
We'll have the power
Power (x3)

Power, it starts with P like pussy
She knows she's got it, she doesn't worry, does she?
Spendin' your cash, leavin' you in the trash
While your little head's thinkin', they're gone in a dash
They got it, know it, that's why they show it
The power of sex, if man could overthrow it
He'd be king in a day, no way
We get rich, hard, give it away
We're weak and as we speak, the girls are hawkin'
Sizin' me up straight out as I'm talkin'
You gotta have control if you want the gold
I don't wanna be alone like Stallone
So I keep my mind thinkin' 'bout the green
And stop dwellin' on the in-between
I got the power

Power

I'm on a mission mackin' hard as a hammer
Take my picture, I might take your camera
My posse might move, and they move fast
A fool's move could be a punk's last
Ain't no criminal although I used to be
Ain't no new jack rappin' ain't new to me
I been makin' records on wax since 1982
Now it's 1988 finally I'm coming through
That adds up to six years of makin' ok jams, but now I'm mad
Here comes the body slam
Turnin' out concerts, housin' the industry
Lovin' all the fly girls screamin' for ICE T
Rollin' with the Syndicate my unstoppable battalion
38 Solid gold my medallion
Gainin' velocity, momentum, and energy
ICE Capital T
I got the power
Power

So you say that I'm a fake, think, you really must be a fool
I been to jail more times than you have probably been in school
Shot at, shot back, hit, and seen my buddies killed
That's the foundation upon the raps of Ice-T are built
I say what I think, the system does stink
Money you walk, you short, you're writin' from the clink
Come on, what's up, you know the laws are full of bull
Prey on the lame, release those with pull
Power, I know you wanna try it
Well check out money can buy it
Control and mold the world to do your wishin'
The knowledge of power is mine, so just listen
Money controls the world and that's it
And once you got it, then you can talk shit
Power

You have the power

Power

You have the power

I got the power(fade out)

[Verse 1]
1-2, 1-2-1-2-3, I'm the emcee called Ice-T
That's DJ Evil E, Islam creates the beats
You girls look so sexy
I wish you all were up here with me
You drive me crazy with them big ole butts
Girls, let's get butt naked and fuck

[Verse 2]
Tonight, I'm trying to make this real clear, dear
I've no time to whisper in your ear
No time to remove your fears
I just wanna get near
Get butt naked and roll around
Move our bodies like up and down
Do that stuff that your mama call smut
Girls, let's get butt naked and fuck

[Verse 3]
Come on, you know you wanna do it too
It's good to me and it's good to you
I only speak what's true
You say you don't, but I know you do
Come on up to my room
We'll undress by the light of the moon
Lay down and I'll caress that butt
Girls, let's get butt naked and fuck

[Verse 4]
I mean real stupid and nasty
I know what you want, so you don't have to ask me
Just lay back and I'll operate
Jimbrowski will go to work and penetrate
And then we'll both feel great
Make your move tonight, girl -- don't hesitate
We both want it, don't make it tough
Girls, let's get butt naked and fuck

[Verse 5]
Homeboys, you know the situation
You're trying to rap but they give you frustration
Nose in the air, turning you down
When you really wanna say, "Yo baby, let's get down"
But you don't, you keep fronting
Kicking conversation, ain't talking 'bout nothing
When all that's really on your mind is what?
"Yo baby, let's get butt naked and fuck"

[Verse 6]
That's right, if you're a man you want it
If you're a woman, you tease him and flaunt it
But my crew got to have it
And after they dog it, I autograph it
The Syndicate don't lecture
We move in a group, seduce and capture
And if the posse has good luck
The girls will get butt naked and fuck that night

[Verse 7]
Islam takes the pictures
And girls, I'mma say Evil E's gonna get ya
Get ya illing in a nude mode
A double X-rated episode
Hotel rooms cold explode when my posse unloads
Sex in effect when we're on the road

[Verse 8]
Put your hands up in the air
If you love sex -- I know you're out there
Safe sex that is
Ya gotta be careful with this '88 sex biz
But that's another song
Girls, move your bodies sexy and the brothers will come along
Homeboys, move in on that butt and say
Girls, let's get butt naked and fuck
It was a Saturday night on the streets of Cali
Threw on my dope silk suit, brushed off my suede Bally's
Threw on enough gold for any girl's pleasure
Left a pound and a half of that shit still in the dresser
I slapped a clip in my nine, threw a clip in my sock
Pick three grand up off the dresser, it was ten on the dot
Now my beeper started beepin, I threw that shit in the sink
I didn't need it no more, I had more money than Brinks
See, I was quittin the game and tonight was my fling
You see, on the streets they're players but only one king
Now that's the title I held but the game is real fast
You gotta get in and get out if you expectin to last
Now my homeboy Evil was downstairs chillin in his brand new Benz
I had many adversaries but very few close friends
We broke to the set, E parked the car on the grass
High-signin was his trademark and he did it with class
Hit the door like two titans, the whole jam stopped to stare
And as we walked through the crowd they threw bills in the air
I spied my man Jazz maxin out with two stone cold freaks
"Yo, what's up Ice, you rich now, man, you too good to speak?"
Now Jazz was a player from the east coast, the Bronx
He was known to be hard on the women and a brother he'd stomp
Smack a bitch in a minute, some say just for fun
And he was known for his chrome-plated pearl-handled gun
"Yo Ice, you my brother and I love you and all
But what's up with that six g's you owe me, man
...'member when your boys took that fall?
And I posted the bail cause yo ass was locked up"
Evil gave Jazz ten g's and Jazz shut the fuck up
Just then I saw Donald-D hit the front door
More gold than a Aztec, black leather he wore
Hoes grabbed for they niggas when D hit the set
Cause what Donald-D wanted is what Donald-D'd get
Donald's eyes hit mine and a smile crossed his face
Then a light hit his ring and blinded the whole goddamn place
"Yo Ice, you the coolest and Evil, you mean
But I got the fliest new shit rollin off gasoline"
Everyone in the party moved quickly outside
To see Donald-D's ultimate Superfly ride
It was black, it was low, cost twice that of my Porsche
A Testarossa Ferrari - convertable of course
It purred like a jet, "Yo man, I bought it with cash"
It had 'Donald-D' written in gold on the dash
Then out of nowhere came a shot across the street
I felt pain in my chest and my knees got weak
There was blood on my hands and I fell to the ground
And all I could hear was, "Yo, Ice is down!"
Somebody had shot me that night that I quit
The night that I ended all this hustlin playin shit
It's ironic ain't it, the night I retired
Would be the same night that my whole life expired
People, it's time for the Ice crush
So listen to my words I bring much
Sense, as I commence, my lyrics intense
Your telephoto, break out your big lens
Look, check out the sales charts
My record's kickin', I'm breakin' P.D.'s hearts
They banned me from their shows
Because they said I'm too hard
But no sell-out, I guess I'm just barred
I ain't changin' mine for nobody
They bleeped words from Doug's 'La Di Da Di'
I can't get a bleep? What's the deal?
Maybe my words are just too real
It's not profanity, it's just the man in me
He doesn't want you to see what I see
Doesn't want you to be what you can be
Word, censorship of reality

"Radio suckers never play me"(x3)

Suckers don't, but some do
The real troopers bring the Ice to you
And close friends to me, yea, Public Enemy
These stations have high intellect
They don't pretend to be, too bourgeois to rock a jam raw
Understand what I'm sayin', they're down by law
They play the jams that are right, sometimes not polite
They realize you gotta get some people uptight
Speak the word, your voice will definitely be heard
Lie to yourself, you're destined to be to the curb
Some stations don't care, they'll never put on the air
Nothin' but commercial junk, their brain power's impaired
They don't listen or try to hear what I write
Maybe just think once, or try some school at night
They're makin' radio wack, people have to escape
But even if I'm banned, I'll sell a million tapes
"Radio suckers never play me" (x3)

I make records for music, not for the money
To some of you that might sound funny
But I ain't broke, and I don't joke
And my lyrics are known to make ears smoke
Clear as a gun scope, I speak the pure dope
Can the radio handle the truth? Nope
Uncut, no edits, no censors
You can get a plastic rapper from any ol' dispenser
A penny a yard, to make a record ain't hard
But to make it mean something, that's a job
But then we do it, they refuse it
So I tell them duck suckers to cold go screw it
We shouldn't sell out, we should just yell out
And get them wack motherfuckers the hell out

"Radio suckers never play me" (x4)

Cruisin' down the street what do I see?
Crash Task Force, L.A.P.D
Gangs illin', wildin' and killin'
Hustlers on a roll, like they got a million
Girls on the strap and you know that
You know the guys will stop wildin' if you stop that crap
But you can't, you want money so bad
You'll jock anything with the Gucci tag
You gotta have it, so the men go get it
Robbin' and stealin', soon to regret it
Livin' in a jail cell, feelin' like a dumbbell
While you jump the next jock, well
That's reality, that's what I see
Nobody says that you got to agree
Censorship, that ain't the way to be
I thought you said this country was free?
"Radio suckers never play me" (x2)

Tone it down is what they say to me
The FCC will not allow profanity
Your subject matter's too hard, make a love song
You better get real, come on
I ain't no lover, I'm a fighter
Hardcore radical rap rhyme writer
Pushin' the button, E does the cuttin'
Everything I say amounts to something
More than a single rap, I'm too deep for that
I lay my lyrics with logic, press the wax
Play it on your tape deck, feel the effect
If you can't take the heat, eject
But I know you can, 'cause you're an Ice-T fan
No sell-outs here, my man

Radio....(fade out)

[Intro]
Yo what's up man, I need to get high man
I need to get hold of some big time dope man
You know where I can get a ki?

I know where you can get an LP

LP, man? Have you went crazy man?
I'm talking about some dope man
I need to get high right now man
Why don't you hook me up with a 5-O?

I can hook you up with a 12 inch

12 inch? Man have you went crazy?
You don't even know what time it is
Out here on the streets and don't know what time it is
Man youse a fool

Yo homeboy you a fool
You don't know what time it is
Out here, messing up your mind
You know what I'm sayin'?
This is Ice-T talkin' to you boy
I'mma tell you what time it is

[Verse 1]
Yo, it's time for me to pump the volume
No problem, the record's revolvin'
Evil's the mixer, I'm the rap trickster
Paparazzi on the bum rush for pictures
Ice, coolin', yo colder than ever
Punk executioner E, pull the lever
Rotate the wax then cut an' axe the tracks
Push up the levels till the red lights max
Don't try to size up, you better wise up
To the rap criminals, we're succeeded
Dope beats and lyrics, no beepers needed
For this drug deal, I'm the big wheel
The dope I'm sellin', you don't smoke, you feel
Out on the dance floor, on my world tour
I'm sellin' dope in each and every record store
I'm the kingpin when the wax spins
Crack or smack will take you to a sure end
You don't need it, just throw that stuff away
You wanna get high? Let the record play

[Bridge]
Aww man, I like this dope here man
It's feelin' alright boy
What you say your name was man?

[Hook]
I'm your momma
I'm your daddy
I'm that nigga in the alley
I'm your brother when you need
A true player to emcee
You know me, a true friend
Your main boy, thick and thin
MC Ice-T
I'm your pusher

[Verse 2]
I know you're lovin' this drug as it's comin' out your speaker
Bass through the bottons, highs thru the tweeters
But this base you don't need a pipe
Just a tempo to keep your hype
Groovin' like I see you doin'
Some stupid crack would just ruin
Your natural high, why? That ain't fly
And anyone who says it is, lies
Move like I knew you would, like I knew could
And if you ain't cracked out, then I know you should
Be able to give me a clap, to match exact with the track
And since I know that you ain't, I expect that
Oh now this jam is lit, it's like the ultimate
People high off dope but still physically fit
I'll make a million bucks, pack my dough in trucks
From sellin' dope beats, dope rhymes, dope cuts
I'll be the biggest dope dealer in history
Because all the fly will be high off that Ice-T

[Bridge]
Aww man, you ain't ever lie, man
This dope's alright man
I gotta get back with you man
Let me get your number man

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'll bring it to boil, Evil E rock it up
You want it? I don't think you got enough
Last suckers crossed, Syndicate shot 'em up
Cops found 'em in the lake bottom up
I don't play when it comes to my dope
I check my lyrics close, like with a microscope
I don't clean 'em up with no Ivory soap
I leave 'em hard and pure, hope that you can cope
Because you might O.D. if you overdrive
This record, tape or CD, because the sound I've
Created on this wax is like a chemical
And the knowledge I give makes me invincible

[Bridge]
Aww Mr. Dopeman
I'm lovin' you man
You got it goin' on man
What else you got?

I got some of that Kool Moe Dee
Aww yeah man, I want some of that

Got some Doug E. Fresh
Aww yeah gimme an ounce of that
I want that all night long

I got some Eric B. & Rakim
Aww that is some real dope right there

I got some LL Cool J
Nah, nah man, I don't want none of that
You can keep that man

I got some Boogie Down Productions, KRS-One
Aww now you're talkin' man, come on

Public Enemy
Yeah don't stop, don't stop

Biz Markie
Makin' music with yo mouth Biz
I love it

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
The cops don't know what to do, because my dope breaks through
No matter what they do, my stuff gets to you
Kickin' on the Boulevard, my tempo's hyped and hard
I don't ask, the ICE just bogards
Sire Records puts me out, with Warner Bros. clout
My dope hits the streets with no doubt
Evil E adds the cut, then removes it
IZ checks for purity, then approves it
And then you get it, try it and like it
And if it ain't potent, we remix and spike it
To bring you the pure dope, not a noose in a rope
Because if you're doin' crack, you're on death row
You're just a toy punk, to mess with that junk
You want some real dope, come look in my trunk
The dope I'm sellin' is life, 100% legit
So get real fool, and try some real hit

[Bridge]
Word up my brother
You got me high as a kite
I feel good tonight
Ice-T, man you alright

[Hook]

I'm your pusher

[Verse 1]
Speed of life: fast
It's like walking barefoot over broken glass
It's like, jumping rope on a razor blade
All lightning quick, decisions are made
Lifestyle plush, females rush
This high profile personality, who earns his pay illegally
Professional liar, schoolboys admire
Young girls desire, very few live to retire
Cash flow extreme, dress code supreme, vocabulary obscene
Definition: street player, you know what I mean
The high rollers (x2)

[Verse 2]
People of the city stop fooling yourself
Crime rules the streets, who the hell else
All the police have gone out to play
Because for enough cold cash they'll look the other way
Just look at the cars as they go by
Benzes, Ferraris, trucks up high
Beepers connecting players to big-time deals
With all of this technology who needs to steal?
Just live a life of leisure every night and day
And you're living proof that crime does pay
Your life is dangerous and reckless
You eat fly guys and girls for breakfast
You're a titan of the nuclear age
Your muscles flex with a Uzi or 12 gauge
And you love the game that's why y'all boast
Because you're high priced, high speed, high post
High roller

[Verse 3]
Now when I say high rollers, I mean the best
Forget the half-steppers, eject the rest
Because these high ranked officials of our city streets
Make millions all triggered by electric beeps
They dress in diamonds and rope chains
They got the blood of Scarface runnin' through their veins
Silk shirts, leather suits
Hair always fresh, eel-skin boots
Large hearts – though their sizes vary
Bankrolls that take 2 pockets to carry
Cruising in their 500 Benz Sedan
With their systems peaked out rockin' Pusherman
Yes, their fashion's high and hard to beat
They buy their Gucci from Gucci's, not the swap meet
Eat very well, much clientele
And whatever you need, they probably sell
The high rollers

[Verse 4]
Oh yes, I'm here to tell you females also roll
Drive the same cars, sometimes wear more gold
Cold as an igloo, or hot as a flame
They'll shake ya, break ya and you won't know their name
Gangsters to the max all marks will be taxed
These girls drive Ferraris not Cadillacs
Respect is demanded most men don't understand it
Till they peep the huge bank that these girls have landed
They're junkies for fun love life on the run
And if things get hot, they will pull a gun
Prey on the lame no shame to the game
And they all seek power fuck the fame
The high rollers

[Verse 5]
Now radio stations probably won't play
This record because of the things I say
They'll say I'm glamorizing the hustling hood
And a record like this can do no good
But I'm not here to tell ya right or wrong
I don't know which side of the law you belong
Yes, the game has flash, but sometimes hurts
Behind any mistake, hard times lurks
And jail's not your only problem though it may seem
You just may die by a barrage from an M-16
But to each his own, choose the mobile phone
The tailored suit, the luxury home
You'll never get caught cause you got nerves of ice
And you're much smarter than those crooks on Miami Vice
Right?
You wanna be a high roller
You wanna be a high roller

You better watch your back if you wanna be a high roller
Ice-T back in that ass
Return of the real
Muthafuckas fakin and frontin like they don't know what time it is
Niggas on the streets ain't really got a muthafuckin choice
Muthafucka

(So niggas is forced to do dirt) --] Prodigy

Born hustler

I only run with real niggas who wear gold and jewels
Diamond rings, strapped with tools
I take no shorts cause I been in it for the long one, the strong one
Gotta tell the truth, yo, half my niggas is on the run
Street giant defiant to the laws
That the white man made, nigga
That's why we play, nigga
A/k/a the street hustler from the Westside
Too damn fly, too much finesse for the hoo ride
I rather take a mark off smooth
Cause the skilll of a hustler is to stick and move
And make you say: "Damn, what's his name?
Got to give a nigga props cause the kid got game"
Mad game, fool, I base my hustle not on strength
But think, you say 'the liqor store', I say 'brinks'
Cause my mind's on the massive roll of the dice
The magnitude of my game's insane, precise
So now you're mad cause I got money and you don't
The hustlers win, the busters won't
What can I say, you can't come out and play
With the real ones, dig this
You'll get broke with the quickness
I don't gamble, I cheat when it's on
Two g's on the table, two in my palm
And if I spill up, I pull the nickel .25 strap
Then the place gets flat and then I'm out the back
With my niggas and them 4's on thangs
And if I really wanna floss I flex my Bentley wings
Damn, over your head, got a problem
Keepin lyrics down to earth so normal niggas can solve em
But the game's extreme so quit your high beams
And increase the light, now can you see me, you might
If you ever been to jail or shot, sold rocks
I'm talkin 'bout weight down like movin ki's and pounds
But every nigga in the hood ain't fly
Light-skinned or dark, they're 90% marks
Straight vics and they got money to give
Then without em tell, me how the hell a hustler lives..

I got no love for a lame
I use my strategy from crack to rap, no shame
And now instead of cooking some ki's
I'm flippin million dollar ??? call em wack MC's
But suckers got it twisted, they missed it
Wastin they life when yo, they mentally gifted
The streets ain't the only fuckin hustle in town
You gotta get in where you fit in, gotta stay way down
But a buster is a buster for life
He makes excuses why his ass ain't pay
That shit's played
Cash rules everything around me, kid
I hit a 50'000 lick and never did no bid
Cause I'm bent on a come-up and my shit stays tight
How many fake gangsta rappers will I hear tonight?
It don't matter cause the real don't care
You know I'mma gonna get mine, so I'mma let em get theirs
But I know in the heart what's true
So if you listen very closely, maybe you will too
My mind's blown off Armani suits
Pavet medaillons, 

[Name] boots
Cristal and steak, shrimp big as your hand
I bought a silk robe and it's from Siam
This jam's for the hoods and thugs
Pimps and hoes, the slingers of drugs
Hustlers and thieves, cons and crooks
Bookers and sharks, muthafuck the marks
Nigga

[ Ice-T ]
Yo Rich man, these girls ready to get busy?

[ Big Rich ]
Ah man, you know they on deck

[ Ice-T ]
Yo, what's up with they men, though?

[ Big Rich ]
Come on, men squares, man
Can't no square keep no woman

[ Ice-T ]
Right
I guess they just wanna find out what it's like on the other side
Girls wanna keep it real
Gotta love em for it
I love a woman with courage

[ Big Rich ]
Yeah, there she go right there, man

[ Ice-T ]
Yeah, I'm break her off somethin proper
I'mma represent, check it out

[ Ice-T ]
Now although your friends warned you 'bout us westside macks
Girl, you was willin to take a chance and I respect you for that
And at last we're all alone, baby, just you and I, don't try to lie
I know what's on your mind, I'm lookin straight through your eyes

[ Big Rich ]
So let that hair down and let that body go free
And come close because tonight it belongs to me
No brother's doin it like this westside mack
Ride you like my Chevy, hit that ass front and back
Now tell me

[ Big Rich ]
Now how does it feel to make love to a gee?
Do you wanna go back to your man or, baby, stay here with me?
Now how does it feel to make love to a gee?
Strictly on the Westside where I ride, now, baby, come roll with me

[ Big Rich ]
Now two hours done passed but then it's only gettin better
My body is gettin hotter while yours is gettin wetter
Wanna roll up in your river like a steamboat
Pretend you're takin a bath and I'm your piece of chalice soap

[ Ice-T ]
Oh my girl, can you feel what I'm feelin now?
As you turn around I'm lookin at that brown
Sugar fat coated ass
I just can't let it pass
Gotta move on it fast
Now tell me, baby

[ Big Rich ]
Now how does it feel to make love to a gee?
Do you wanna go back to your man or, baby, stay here with me?
Now how does it feel to make love to a gee?
Strictly on the Westside where I ride, now, baby, come roll with me

[ Ice-T ]
Alright, check this out, girls
Me and my man Big Rich, we got an idea
Why don't we just use body language
Let our bodies do all the talking
And just kick back and enjoy the erotic conversation

[ Big Rich ]
Hello Sunshine, now you did quite fine
Shall we rewind, relive these good times?
I feel your body gettin hot again
Girl, don't you know I'm 'bout to dive on in?
(It's never gonna stop until I know it's truly over)
I got some more oil I wants to stick up in your motor
And kiss you on the grill, squeeze your headlights
Rub your bumper kitten, gettin nasty like a triple x-rated flick

[ Ice-T ]
I know you're feelin what I'm feelin, sexual energy
Time to chill and pour another glass of Hennessy
I hit it again like a gangster should
And give you somethin to tell them girls up the hood
Now how does it feel?

[ Big Rich ]
Now how does it feel to make love to a gee?
Do you wanna go back to your man or, baby, stay here with me?
How does it feel to make love to a gee?
Strictly on the Westside where I ride, now, baby, come roll with me

[ Ice-T ]
Yeah, this is Ice-T and Big Rich signin off
And to all the curious ladies out there
Take your chance
I promise, you won't be sorry

[Ice-T]
Liquid, solid, gas - we'll be kickin ass
In any form, or matter, or mass
(This ain't science class) I know but it's science
From the rhyme boss of the Syndicate alliance
Ballin', makin' ya feel the growth
Rhyme Syndicate brotherhood, we rock a blood oath
Radical posse down to death
While your crew's on the tape, Donald-D break

[Donald-D]
Syndicate comin through, I'm talkin to you
Flexin hardcore, what could you do?
When we roll up you send your girl up to the crib-o
Is it Rambo? No, the mic ammo
Stompin you down on the ground, task forces
Let you know Rhyme Syndicate bosses
Any show, any tour, we house program
Donald-D is who I am, damn

[Hen-Gee]
Attempt to do this, boy, you're takin a risk
Cause my voice sounds doper than a compact disc
Styles and lyrics, precise right in the pocket
Stupid dope beats and Evil E rocks it
( ? ) straight from my heart
My jam is sure to hit the top of the charts
Ram is my sign, he's different from all kinds
Rock you all of the time, just form a single line

[Ice-T]
A lot of MC's like to talk 'bout they self
A first-grade topic, I think you need help
How many time on one album can you say you're def?
"I'm baaaad" - Yo punk, save your breath
That's weak shit from a weak mind
And a weak mind creates weak rhymes
You ain't never kicked knowledge one time
Just livin on your own dick (that's a crime)
Homeboy, why don't you talk about somethin
You just talkin loud and sayin nothin
And if you get mad, sorry brother
And when you're in LA, watch your colors

[Donald-D]
I'm a MD, but no medical doctor
Mic-Dominator Donald-D has got you
Comin to the jamboree to hear the poetry
And when you break north, the melody
Stick to your mind like paste, it can't be erased
Face to face I overpower like bass
To the climax, I don't carry a sax
I carry a axe to tax and wax those who rap

[Hen-Gee]
Born in Brooklyn, crib West Coast
MC's I toast, you that talk most
Trash, noise, can't throw, get with it
Comin from the mouth of Hen-Gee from the Syndicate
Ballers, mafia down to throw
Gangsters, convicts throwin solid blows
Start prayin, your sisters I'm layin
I'm Hen-Gee, a Spinmaster, hear what I'm sayin?
(Party on the dancefloor)
(Evil E's in the place)
(Doggin the wax)

[Hen-Gee]
An organization, alliance, no duplication
Rhyme Syndicate, a strong creation
The Syndicate's stronger day by day
12-gauge leave suckers brutally
Layin in a (?)
Your lines are thin, Hen-Gee came to win
Don't talk a bunch, just known to crunch
My one-two punch will put your butt out to lunch

[Donald-D]
Full-court pressure's what I'm applyin
No relyin on the next man, roar like a lion
Flexin, plexin ultra, the Bronx is my culture
Strikin hard like a vulture
Flingin, I'm slingin my hammer like Thor
No singin, bringin it raw to the core
Shogun assassin maxin in a limousine
You stick your head in, out comes the guillotine

[Ice-T]
(?) the game as I kick it
Don't miss it, get with it
Diss it, you're a knucklehead evicted
From the crowd that's proud to be the Syndicate connection
Respect mandatory, up is the direction
I stand alone, one man that's true
But you, my crew, you're on my side
We're on a ride
Power and pride is our gift
And you're down with
The Syndicate
Yeah
This is Ice-T
I'mma slow it down for a minute
I wanna talk to all the ladies out there
I got my man J-e-ll in the house
I got a message I wanna send out to all the fly ladies, yeah
Check me out

[ VERSE 1: Ice-T ]
It's time for me to kick game
And if I can't do it, then ladies, Ice ain't my name
Now real brothers ain't easy to understand
And it's a long hard road to become a man
Drama seeks and chases him through every year
His homie dies, you might see him shed a tear
But mostly hardcore feelings are all you see
Cause you gotta be raw to be called a gee
But every man slows down
You'll see this side when there's probably no one around
And there's no safer place
Than if you ever are some gee's homebase
But it ain't easy, these brothers got barricades around the hearts
It's gonna take time before the trust starts
But girl, you must be true
Cause if your man's a gee, he'll definitely die for you
Look him deep in his eyes, let him know you're there
Show him that you really care
Trust me, you move with time
Through the darkened halls of his mind
You just might find

[ Bobby Ross Avila ]
The me inside of a gangsta

Yo, Jell
You know what I'm sayin?
I try to represent for all the brothers out there
And I know my latin homies have the same drama with they girls, man
Won't you let em know how it's goin down

[ VERSE 2: Jell ]
Man, I'm lookin for a hina that's down
But you don't have to be brown
If you wanna hang around
All you gotta do is stay in check
Cause if you're rubbin me right
Then you can bet you'll get respect
And that's why I guess my feelings will have to show
How can you hide somethin that's in your soul?
Cause there's more to the l-o-c
Than all the violence, baby, that ain't who I be
I know my dogs and me can still pull straps
But I rather have you rollin in my Cadillac
Cause when we cruisin, thangs is all good
And that goes for every vato in the hood
Now sometimes it's hard to show the other side
Especially when my crew is caught up in a homicide
Cause East L.A. don't play
And if I had my way
I'd kick it with you everyday

[ Ice-T ]
Whether black or brown, the situation's the same
Different hoods, but the same game
Some girls won't take their time
Others will stroll through our souls and find

The me inside of a gangsta
(I cramp your style
With a bullet and a smile) --] Onyx

[ VERSE 1 ]
Ugh, niggas on the d-l casin me out
Truckin my jewels, feelin for the tools
When they come they gots to come correct
Because they know I catch wreck
A well-known wild street vet
Step into the kill zone, baby, it's on
I pack the twin nine-mills that'll lift your dome
Chrome pump with double-eyed slots and such
A fully-auto Mac-dime that is sure to touch
Ya, bust you with the Desert Eagle
Street legal, move against my peole
And the Ice gets evil
Hit you with the .44 Smith & Wes-
Son, you're best to run cause my Tec eats pests
I got a Glock with the laser, hot police taser
Step in real close, I hit your throat with the razor
You wanna live or die, it's your decision
Talk shit, you're dissin, I got you in my night vision
Brain fragments on the street released
Another nigga fronts hard, another nigga deceased
I got a H.K., A.K. and a M-16
A 12-gauge street sweeper with the circular clip
Quick to let projectiles fly, you die
And watch your fat moms cry - bull's eye
(I cramp your style
With a bullet and a smile) --] Onyx

What you think all the guns is for?

[ VERSE 2 ]
What's up, niggas don't seem to hear
Still lookin crazy, let me make this clear
Fool, the Ice ain't havin it
And when I let loose lead, believe I'm accurate
Fat scope on a 30 ot 6
Sawed-off double barrel and a pistol grip
Pump on my lap at all times
I fill my gauge shells with nickels and dimes
Thompson Center spittin .45 slugs
Black Mac-11, Python .357
Snub-nose .38 or .380
Seventy Automatic, full metal jackets
Hollow points comin atcha fast
You feel the slug before you hear the blast

(I cramp your style
With a bullet and a smile) --] Onyx

Muthafuckas frontin hard
Lookin at niggas crazy and shit
Make a nigga break
Nigga don't want me to pull out

[ VERSE 3 ]
I don't like shootin but I do shoot straight
Niggas I be rollin with will shoot up a wake
Why you wanna step in the sights of a nigga
Known hair trigger, the coroner delivers
More cold bodies to the morgue each weekend
One minute you bleed, the next minute you're leakin
Best to listen close cause this ain't no boast
And never forget that I leave you wet
Bloody, sticky, holes in your Dickey's
Oh what a pity, lookin all shitty
My Winchester will get the best of ya
Hand grenades will fade all the rest of ya
I reach out and touch you with the parabellum
You got a crew, you better tell em

[Hen-Gee]
Dear Homie, whats the hap, since your up in the sky?
With God by your side
Homie what's it like?
I know your bein' treated right
No more worries
Plus you're bein heard G
I guess you know niggas is still trippin
I don't know why, they see a future in it
We're headed for self-destruction
Can't function
Only thing I can do is pray
And thank God, for another day
Yes Homie, it's rough down here. I gotta watch my back
Cos it's hard being black
If it ain't the other
It's my own colour
Tryin to work me
Tryin to hurt me
Ain't no L-O-V-E
Please tell me why, Dear Homie

[Ice-T]
Dear Homie, gang-bangin ain't joke
And I'm lookin over ya loc
Always knew there was fools out to get me
I didn't even hear the gunshots till after the slugs hit me
I grabbed for my chest and my neck, hopin
When my head hit the ground my skull busted open
You used to ask for my advice
Well Dear Homie, dyin ain't nothin nice
And the place I'm at is overpacked
With young blacks who crash crack and gats
I can only pray
You don't come this way
You gotta stay alive, you got a kid G
I feel ya partner but I worry alot
Bust shots
I know you're tryin' to comfort me
But I don't want no company, Homie

[Hen-Gee]
Dear Homie, even though you're gone
I still fell your presence
Sometimes I can sleep
Cos I just can't see
Reality like it really should be seen
I still reminisce on how we used to kick it
Strollin' the yard, just hangin' out together
Down for whatever, whenever
And now I'm hopin, you're seeing a true friend in me
We where meant to be

[Ice-T]
Dear Homie, you used to call me O.G
Now ya really gotta look up to me
Cos the place I'm at, is way high in the sky
I didn't want to die
But the life I lived was just to reckless
Too many bad marks on God's checklist
And many many brothers will go out
Just tryin to get that hard-core street clout
But a street reps final test, is when you're lying in a coffin
With you're hands folded on your chest
Then ya hear the girls cry
Then ya hear the brothers lie
Talkin' about how down you was
Then the next week the back on the street, they cold forgot ya cuz'
Don't wanna see ya on your back
So for me stay sucka free, cos you don't need that, Homie

Dear Homie...
Dear Homie...
Ya know I miss ya Homie...
Nobody ever said life was gon' be easy
But damn..

[ VERSE 1 ]
Just a kid, moms died when I was seven
Pops died, eleven, what's up with heaven?
It's hell when you're an orphan at a early age
This impressionable stage, no love breeds rage
In the heart of a child who never knew his roots
Looked up to pimps and to hustlers in the eel-skin boots
Parkin Caddies on the sidewalk, gangsta talk
Truckin diamonds and gold
Rubberbands around the bankrolls
Fly girls to make your head spin
Seemed they partied all night long
I was like, "Put me on"
But they said, "Little fellow, run and go play
Take your butt to school or else you'll have to be like us one day"
I didn't understand, but I tried to get a job
While all the players got the girls cause they'd hustle and rob
I was like makin 'bout 1-50 a week
And after taxes, you know what that is - lunch meat
And I know I can be better than this
I gotta get me a car, man
I gotta get a girl

I know I can do it out there, man
I'm gonna go for it, man
I gotta get some money
Word

[ VERSE 2 ]
Streets of anger, trouble and crime
I had it hard, had to sleep in my car sometime
But I never let another player see me down
I kept my front up, my gear clean
Even when checkin minor green
Brothers knew my game was true
So I hooked up with the real crew
That knew excactly what to do
Bank jobs and jewels, quick to flex with tools
Pimpin hoes on the block
Checkin cash non-stop
Crack spots, armor with interior bars
No lie, I used to own 'bout 15 cars
Every piece Fila made
Drape my women in suede
Pavet Piaget, Cesar's Palace holidays
It was on, crazy out of control
We made up the word 'ballin', that was how we rolled
But the FBI had a-whole-nother idea
It's called multiple indictments for hundreds of years
What
Daff is dead?
Carter got 25 years?
Nah..
Spike 35 to life?
Nah, don't tell me B.O.'s dead, man
I don't wanna hear that, man
I was just with him

[ VERSE 3 ]
The game is vicious, no retirement, you die young
Listen to a fake, he might tell you to grab a gun
I get phone calls from condemned row
Brothers I ran with, brothers I really know
They tell me, "Ice you got much love in the pen
You're the one that got away, don't wanna see you in"
They tell me, "Tell the little homies the deal
Don't let em come up in this hellish habitat of shanks and steel"
I marched two million strong in D.C
Lookin eye to eye with brothers that I used to think below me
Damn, my mind was twisted in my hustlin days
But God spared me, I got a baby son to raise
And bein black ain't easy, prejudice is real
But health and liberty is all we need for us to build
We gotta come together, unseparated
Check yourself like I did, blackman, because we're all related
'96
Ah shit
Ice-T back
Representin, nigga, once again
That real shit, nigga
I thought you knew, bitch
Better recognize

[ Hook ]
Players, check your grip before you get popped
Bitches, get my money before you get dropped
Gotcha - buggin off the words I say
Because this type of pimpin happens every day

[ VERSE 1 ]
Niggas wanna know my steelo
Bitches wanna get with the baddest
Hustlin apparatus
It's the LA cash flow master-roller
No one gets colder, I used to flip boulders
Of caine, on my brain, it's outta control, crime plot
A dead-ass cop and muthafuckas get got
In the game it ain't safe for the weak or the timid
Known to break a bitch but barely rarely slide up in it
So you see me in a club, grab your woman like you wanna
Blink your eyes and the freak is out there freezin on the corner
She got caught by the curls and the jewels
Lookin for a nigga that is quick to pull tools
Now she's breakin herself, makin herself
Respect my technique of pimpin, minus all simpin
Check it bitches, it ain't nothin nice
You're gonna seal or sell pussy if you roll with the Ice

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
Oh my God, the nigga rolls hard..
Every player mentions me
The hustler of the century
(Ice, that nigga ain't nothin nice!)
I got more freaks than Heff', my bankroll's off vice
Commandin straight pimp tactics
None of y'all can match this
Meet a freak in a week, her workplace a mattress
Really though, recognize the pimp type flow
I don't smoke endo, I count cash on my patio
So much love on the streets, don't need no bodyguard
Big up to my homies with the pimp type nod
I'm off the hook, checkin traps in Vegas 

[Name]
Full link mink with the matchin borsalino
I change cars like you change drawers, bitch
I got a stable full of thoroughbreds that make me rich
Niggas hate me, cause they can't control they roll
They see that fat old ass and start givin me cash

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
My mind's blown off fine champagne
So bent on currency, got green in my vein
So damn smooth that every woman wanna touch me
So much sexuality that nuns wanna fuck me
I kick back with my pimpin ballin brothers
Stand over the bed, dump the cash on the covers
The game's got me, I'm a slave to the roll
Hoes belong on the track and I belong in gold
Silk and satin, I deserve a pimpin pattin
Been in the life so long cause I stomp bitches who start rattin
Mostly friendly, but do got that gorilla in me
Save it for the player-hater niggas with the envy
Lot of niggas talk it, but they can't hold a hooker
Ice took her, she was too long a looker
It's strictly straight-lace hustlin on mine
I been pimpin all my life and I don't mind dyin

[ Hook ]

[ Hook ]
The fast lane, half heart, half money
Ain't nobody smilin, ain't nothin funny
Raise the risk, raise the profit
And can't nobody stop it
Unless your game's weak
So baby, don't sleep

The fast lane, half heart, half money
Ain't nobody smilin, ain't nothin funny
Raise the risk, raise the profit
And can't nobody stop it
Unless your game's weak
So player, don't sleep

[ VERSE 1 ]
The streets crawl with ill niggas on the block
Goin hand in hand
Leanin in and out of sedans
Pumpin crack dreams to crack fiends for a fee
Their dream is to re-up to a ki
Cops watch the influx of dope
Through a telescope
Snitches in the game
Give the young g's names
Bitches on the jock
Of the hustlers on the block
Jump from gee to gee
Similar to a flea
Suck the blood out, or in this case the dough
Roll with the blow till considered a ho
Babies are born and pawned off to grandmama
The bitch ain't done, she still lives for the drama
Lookin for another baller
To hit and never call her
All in vain
Life in the Lane
A new crew of hookers on the track from up north
Vice cops, they watch em stroll back and forth
They take a pay-off
Or a blow job just to lay off
The Lane's no joke
Yo, you players stay broke
A ghetto garage makes a nice laboratory
PCP and crystal meth, wars of glory
End of story, gotta watch my back myself
Or else they'll find my body layin on a coroner shelf
It's the Lane

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
Gees take the game on the road to Minnesota
Supermarket's all sold out on baking soda
Gangbangers start to understand the dope game fast
Kidnap the drug dealers for the ransom cash
Gotta represent, what you say you are, that's a star
Feds got a homing device on your car
That made you easy to follow to Denver, Colorado
Birds you had, 12 now you got a l
Crack babies born in the hospitals cryin
Drive-by shootings can't end, kids are dyin
The cream is the ultimate goal
Gots to roll
Till my cash flow's mega
Baller not a beggar
Bitches workin plastic with the fake ID's
Life in the Lane, stackin up g's
Chop shops taggin up Benzes and Beamers
Crack spots boilin full kilos in beakers
Damn, the game's quicker than shit, don't slip
Cause bet your life there'll be another hustler checkin yo grip
It's the Lane

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Brother on parole need a quick lick to come up
The score went bad, now he's back stuck
Bitches settin niggas up jacked and waxed
Small-time workers movin weight in a g ride Lac
Don't talk on your cellular, your phone is tapped
Don't check the rear view, there's no turnin back
It's the Lane, now you're in it, hit the gas and mash
Through the land of the hardcore hoes and cash
Jackers and robbers, hustlers and clockers
Everybody'll squeal, take the l or the deal
Yo, spin the wheel, for the cops you're a meal
Tailor suits gator boots make the fly hoes kneel
But if you miss, my friend, guess what you win
A one-way ticket to the federal state pen
It's the Lane you chose, you fill your shit, ride Rolls
High-priced clothes, baddest fuckin hoes
Anything goes, there's no limit, just mash
The cops will be there when you crash

[ Hook ]
He yo, Ice
This guy here say he wants to get in, man
You're sure homeboy's ready?
Yo Ice, this nigga said he's ready, man
Yo, kid you're sure you wanna be down with this, right?
Yeah, I'm sure, I'm ready
Aight
Know what you're in for, right?

[ VERSE 1 ]
Blood flows like sands in the hourglass
Cash moves everything
Bitches in g strings
Gats flashin, mothers make cream on a stick move
Improve your dope flow
Cold max with the long dough
High rollin, back breakin plot diggers
The ill niggas
Comanche style
Blood letting weapons of death
Stop your breath
If you trip on the click
A hot thump to your chest
And your back just rips
You wanna be a made man
The fam accepts no mistakes
Chopped up bodies, lots of funeral wakes
Make your bones
Bring a rat back dead just ahead
A cop's better
Use this beretta
Snitch, bet your bitch
She in a pre-dug ditch
Cause I command a whole batallion of life takers
Plus the other bosses wanna see yo guts
Check your nuts
Dump the bodies in the desert
Here's the keys to a truck
Me, I'm overloaded, born hard and scarred
Crime intellect
More complex than nerves in your spinal chord
Bank job my forte
Not off of gunplay
Hostage taker
I killed my brother with a salt shaker
He tried to short me a buck
What the fuck?
A nigga that lies
Is a nigga that dies
No cries for the punk
He got trunked and bombed
Since he tried to steal I chainsawed his arm
I drink blood from a cup when I wanna then
Plus the bosses up north made me kill my friend
They told me, "This ain't no game, kid, you're in it
You're down with the Syndicate, but never admit it"

[ Hook ]
Muthafucka, now you're down for life
Rat on the fam and we'll kill your wife
Fuck up a scam and you'll feel the knife
Who is this?
(The Syndicate does not exist)

[ VERSE 2 ]
A thousand ki's, off-shore private yacht
Really ain't no sweat, Coast Guard and customs are bought
Columbian-Mexicano connect
Raise the bet
One DEA woudn't roll, we pulled his tongue through his neck
Just a message to the rest: don't test
Housing developments are built on the bodies
Of punks who wouldn't party
Big shots are called from the pen's inner sanctum
Where the mega-gees
Regulate the streets, fuck release
They got power that you can't comprehend, my friend
They want you dead, yo, you're dead before the daylight ends
Your eyes shiver and you grit your teeth
You sold your soul, now cold blood's how you get relief
Now you do what we do, say what I say
Muthafucka, don't blink unless I say okay
This is a organization, not a one-man gang
And you die if I ever hear you spilled my name

[ Hook ]

My friend, I thought this day would never come
(What do you mean, man? Hey!)
Who was there when your wife had your first child?
(Hey, why you're lookin at me like that, man?)
Who looked out for you when no one else was there?
(Hey, I'm your friend, man!)
Now word's out you're talkin to the feds about me
(..they lyin, man)
There's only one thing I can do
(Hey man, wait a -)
You treat me like a bitch
(Hey yo - )
( *shots* )
Now look at you!
Look at you, muthafucka!
Now look at you!

[ VERSE 3 ]
Cops on the take, I got moves to make
Feds ain't that easy, I still got em to shake
They had my man's bitch wired for a month and a half
Snatched my nigga up in Aspen, bail's five million
Bounced him out in a hour - power
Went and met him quick, hit him with a ice pick
Can't take no chances, he romancin with whores
No tellin what he spilled when behind closed doors
The fam's protection and loyalty is top priority
Violate, your body is found in three states
Cargo is heat on a Hong Kong cruiser
??? contact ???
No cash, they want a ton of crystal meth
High risk'll bring more riches than the national debt
We launder money through he s&l's and pro-ball teams
Ain't no business untouched when it comes to cream
Documents forged from my hitters from Jamaica
In and out of town before you hit the ground
This is the mob, baby, now you're on, no off-switch
Suffocation ??? you snitch

[ Hook ]
It's time to start the party if ya'll don't mind
Me and E clean our Adidas with 409
He rocks the highs, I dog the bass
Ya wanna hear us rock? Here's a taste!

Every day I make a sandwich with ham and cheese
Use miracle whip, I don't like mayonnaise
I eat a can of beans, good for my heart
About 1 PM, I always...
Far from me to bite another's rhyme
They're just too easy to write, I do 'em two at a time
Like doggin' the wax and ya don't quit
And if you didn't like that then suck my...
Dictations how I write my raps
Cold maxin' with two freaks upon my lap
Chillin' on the phone, bookin' more def shows
And if the freaks get illy, I smack the...
Whole days of my life are spent inside my bed
Just maxin' and relaxin' like I'm at club med
Ya say you like this record, you think it's fun?
Party people get stupid, we just begun!
(Break)

You're get, get, gettin' real stupid
As the beat hits your body (get ill)
You ain't dumb, you paid your dollars to party (go off)
The girl you're dancin' with has got great hips (bug out)
Go on, homeboy, and grab her...
Tape recorder, turn up the bass
No time to waste, just dog the place
R-R-R-Rocket like a missile in space
Evil E keeps his 1200s in an anvil case
We fly T.W.A., Pan Am, P.S.A
To places close to home, far away
L.A., New York, Detroit, Miami
If I see a girl and like her then I let her see my...
Jam rockin's how I got my fame
Ice capital T, Evil E's his name
If you can't see who's rockin' you must be blind
You better clean your gazelles with some 409!

Go, Ice, get busy
Go, Ice, get busy
Go, Evil, get busy
Go, Evil, get busy

Turn up your stereo, equalize treble
Bass be kickin' stupid hard as metal
On the mic tonight, you're right, your rhyme opponent
M.C. Ice T just microphonin'
33 and 1/3 revolutions per minute
This record is def because my heart is in it
Vocals laid by the Ice, tempos tight and precise
Special effects will be created by an editor's splice
The funk is in it, ya dig it, so stop that frontin'
Bust a move to my groove, work your body, do somethin'
No way in the world that you can deny my method
As my record rotates, my words get more impressive
I'm an M.C., Evil's my DJ
On Sire Records not M.C.A
C.B.S., Capitol, cause they move too slow
Now Sire/Warner Bros. (clocks all the dough)
As the record revolves money's gettin' made
A.S.C.A.P. pays me every time it's played
I chill in def leathers pure silks and suede
And the gold around my neck will never fade
Down with my Syndicate organized rhyme
Kickin' def tempos that I design
And if you can't hear 'em, that's such a crime
You better wash your dirty ears with some 409
I always rhyme elite, stay on beat
I travel in a posse when I walk the street
I loved to say my rhymes when I used to max
Now I don't speak much, I save my words for wax
I just wanna make a little point in this song
With a little nonsense we can all get along
And on and on till the break'a break of dawn
This jam will never play out because the groove's too strong
Guys grab a girl, girls grab a guy
If a guy wants a guy (please take it outside)
I wanna make ya enjoy yourself
On the mic tonight (Ice T!) Who else?
Evil's on the cuts, Henry Gee's shot gun
Islam's my producer, Bambatta's son
Bronx Style Bob's cold watchin' my back
Melle Mel's just layin' for some punks to act wack
Grandmaster Caz and Donald D
Scott La Rock, Red Alert, Chuck Chill Out
If you're down with my crew, you will be fine
But if you ill we'll get dirty, bring your 409!

(Break)

409

[Verse 1]
6 in the morning, police at my door
Fresh Adidas squeak across the bathroom floor
Out my back window I make my escape
Didn't even get a chance to grab my old school tape
Mad with no music, but happy 'cause free
And the streets to a player is the place to be
Got a knot in my pocket, weighing at least a grand
Gold on my neck, my pistols close at hand
I'm a self-made monster of the city streets
Remotely controlled by hard hip-hop beats
But just living in the city is a serious task
Didn't know what the cops wanted, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]
Word

[Verse 2]
Seen my homeboys cooling way, way out
Told 'em 'bout my morning cold bugged 'em out
Shot a little dice till my knees got sore
Kicked around some stories 'bout the night before
Posse to the corner where the fly girls chill
Threw action at some freaks until one bitch got ill
She started acting silly, simply would not quit
Called us all punk pussies, said we all weren't shit
As we walked over to her, ho continued to speak
So we beat the bitch down in the goddamn street
But just living in the city is a serious task
Bitch didn't know what hit her, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]
Word

[Verse 3]
Continued clocking freaks with immense posterior
Rolling in a Blazer with a Louis interior
Solid gold, the ride was raw, bust a left turn was on Crenshaw
Sean-e-sean was the driver, known to give freaks hell
Had a beeper goin' off like a high school bell
Looked in the mirror, what did we see?
Fucking blue lights: L.A.P.D
Pigs searched our car, their day was made
Found an Uzi, .44 and a hand grenade
Threw me in the county high-power block
No freaks to see, no beats to rock
Didn't want trouble but the shit must fly
Squabbled with this sucker, shanked him in the eye
But just living in the county is a serious task
Nigga didn't know what happened, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Back on the streets after five and a deuce
Seven years later, but still had the juice
My homeboy Hen Gee put me up the track
Told me E's rolling Villain, BJ's got the sack
Bruce is a giant - Nat C's clocking dough
Be-Bop's a pimp, my old freak's a ho
The batter rams rolling, rocks are the thing
Life has no meaning and money is king
Then he looked at me slowly and Hen had to grin
He said, "Man, you out early, we thought you got ten"
Opened his safe, kicked me down with cold cash
Knew I would get busy, he didn't waste time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
I bought a Benz with the money, the rest went on clothes
Went to the strip, started pimping the hoes
My hair had grew long on my seven year stay
And when I got it done, on my shoulders it lay
Hard from the joint, but fly to my heart
I didn't want trouble, but the shit had to start
Out with my crew, some punks got loud
Shotgun blasts echoed through the crowd
Six punks hit, two punks died
All causalities was applied to their side
Human lives has to pass just for talking much trash
We didn't know who they were, no one had the time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 6]
Swat-team leader yelled, "Hit the floor"
Reached in my pocket, pulled my .44
Dove across the room, peeped out the window
Twenty cops jumped behind a Pinto
Out the backdoor like some damn track stars
Broke down an alley, jumped into a car
Suckers didn't even see us, they musta been blind
Black wire touched red, the car was mine
We hadn't done nothing but some suckers got shot
Hit the first turn, goddamn road block
Broke through the block and we did it fast
Cops wouldn't shot us on sight, they wouldn't took time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 7]
The rollers gave chase at a serious speed
One more conviction was all I need
This shit was for real, it was no La-Di-Da-Di
'Cause the boys had to pin the shit on somebody
And me and my crew, we were known to get ill
We carried heat for protection but not to kill
We bust a corner doing 60, one police car spun
And all I was thinking was, murder one
Bust a move into an alley and did it right
And me and my crew, we're gone into the night
Broke to my old lady's who drew me a bath
She didn't even know what happened, didn't care, didn't ask

[Hook]

[Verse 8]
We made love like crazy on top of the sheets
This girlie was my worlie, a natural freak
She ran her tongue over each and every part of me
Then she rocked my Amadeus while I watched TV
A technician with a mission, that's what she was
If there had been a crowd she would've got an applause
This girl did everything on Earth to me that could be done
Then she backed off and teased me so I couldn't cum
Then she cold got stupid, pushed me on the floor
Had me begging to stop as I was screaming for more
After she waxed my body, she let me crash
She knew her loving was def, she didn't waste time to ask

[Hook]

[Verse 9]
Up the next morning, feeling good as hell
Sleeping with a girlie sure beats a cell
Hit the boulevard in my A.M.G
Ho's catching whiplash, trying to glimpse the T
Ring on my mobile, yes, cellular
Got to have a phone when I'm in my car
Was my homeboy Red, some say he's insane
Broke his bitch jaw for smoking 'caine
Told me to meet him at the airport
Said he's jumping bail, said he just left court
Caught the first thing smoking in a serious dash
Didn't know where we were going, didn't care, didn't ask

[Hook]

[Verse 10]
Fell asleep on the plane and so did he, woke up chilling in N.Y.C
Called up my posse when I got there
Hit the Latin Quarter and Union Square
Rooftop devil's nest, the rest we passed
Back-door'd the Palladium just for class
About 4 a.m. we crashed the deuce
We never catch static 'cause my boys got juice
Deuced it to the Bronx to rest our heads
Where a shoot-out jumped off, nine people lay dead
It sounded like it happened with a Mac-10 blast
But it was 6 in the morning, we didn't wake up to ask

[Hook]
Ice-T, nigga
Representin
Strictly Westside, nigga
South Central in the muthafuckin hiddouse
Check the technique, nigga
Representin for my real niggas out there
Fuck all you buster-ass niggas
Word

[ VERSE 1 ]
Saturday night in L.A., time to play
My beepers hummin like a vibrator, gotta make crime pay
I'm packin two gats and I wish I could carry more
Might sound crazy, but I ran out of slugs before
Yeah, I know the feds watch me
But my vest clashes hard with the Versace
So I'm just rollin in the black five hun'
I used to lowride, now it's just for fun
I had 5 cars, but now I got one
Hard to keep up ballin when you're on the run
I got two ki's in my trunk and a shovel
Stepped on the one, so now I gots double
The shovel's for drama, need I say more?
Got the fat stash spot under my passenger floor
That's for the other strap, the automatic type
I gotta keep it close in case shit gets hype
Got a bitch in jail, she didn't snitch, she did three
I'mma have to roll solo till they set her free
Cause I got some other crimeys down, true gees
But they got all day, so now it's just me
And I'mma kick this slang until the day I die
I can't go straight, I won't even try
I'm stuck in the game, so don't ask me why
It's life in L.A
I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
Long Beach and Compton are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where the shit goes down

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now niggas like they credit and they like to get they loans on
So I hooked up with my boy who turns them phones on
He told me bout this nigga who won't pay
He also said he knew excactly where the muthafucka stay
So I went and got some homies I hang with
Some crazy muthafuckas who I used to bang with
We took a trip to his crib
I snatched his ho and his kids, and this is what we did
I tied they punk ass up
I cracked the safe with an axe, and then the phones we cut
I didn't hurt his wife
But I promised next time that I would take her life
I shot a nigga in his neck for disrespect, caught a body
Got a murder in Miami for a shoot-out at a party
Got blood in my trunk from a punk who squealed
Had a partner tried to play me and his cap I peeled
Now I rest with my finger on my heater
Hand on my beeper, a light sleeper

I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
New York and Philly are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where my shit goes down
I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
Frisco and Oakland are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where my shit goes down

[ VERSE 3 ]
I use to sling enough water you could float a boat
You could ski on the mountains of fuckin coke
But now most niggas serve chronic
So I let em check the bank, and then I'm all up on it
I serve em with a cute ho
In a week they tell my bitches 'bout all they dough
Then I jack and I kill
The jack's for the money, the kill's for thrills
I got 9'000 blacks that still serve crack
Got a bitch who works the Plaza too on the track
Got a GTA connection and I fence for jewels
Got some little kids that move my fuckin dope in schools
Got warrants for arrest in about 20 states
Got a bigger body count than fuckin Norman Bates
I'm a killer, jacker, dealer, pimp supreme
I'm livin out the hustler dream

I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
Houston and Atlanta are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where that shit goes down

[ VERSE 4 ]
Tonight I gotta meet this nigga from around the way
Some think he's cool, I think he's DEA
He said he want it bad, he heard that I got it good
I bagged up ten ki's of flour and met him in the hood
I met him at my spot, cause I know it's cool
Pat him down on sight to remove his tool
I made him name 10 niggas he should know
But that still ain't shit in the game of blow
He asked to see the dope, I asked to see the cash
He reached for that briefcase too fast
A fuckin pig, yo, he thought he had the jump
I had my nigga in the closet with a bull pump
And now there's fuckin shot-up body all on the floor
But that's what the shovel's for...

I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
Newark and Miami are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where my shit goes down

I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
Detroit and Chicago are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where that shit goes down

I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
D.C. and Cleveland are some down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where the shit goes down

I lowride and I sag and cuss
I cover my face with the rag and bust
I know all my niggas live in down-ass towns
But South Central L.A. is where my shit goes down
(Make it funky)
So the people can get down to the funky sound
'Cause my crew don't mess around
(Make it funky)
So the girls can get busy, dog the dance floor
Make the guys get dizzy
(Make it funky)
Totally def as Evil E cuts the records and the beat is kept
(Make it funky)

Stupid fly, it's got to be F-U-N-K-Y
So that you can get loose as I produce sounds hard as the deuce
Manipulate the bass gain give the level's a boost
The lyric layer rhyme sayer, born to be player
If politics were my kick then I'd be your mayor
Governator, Senator, I'm your mentor
Rap rhythm is erratic, time is four, four
I'm the microphone scholar, clockin' long dollars
Here to make the place funky while the fly girls holler
Genius vocalist, rhyme style priceless
Pound of gold around my neck, mic in my first
The microphone virtuoso crazy insane I'm loco
With the speed to exceed, make other MC's look slow-mo
Un-lease release words mean as a beast
I eat MC's for lunch and dinner, I can serve for a feast
Their rhymes are elementary, mine deserve a PH D
This beat is F-U-N-Key my name is Ice T
Make it funky

Undoubtedly you recognize this jam is the ultimate cut
Uncontrollably you motivate and move your butt
It's rough the beat is gangsterous, call it tough
If you're dissin' stop frontin', come on what's up?
Complicated voice gymnastics are all in your face
Vegas got my highs, E.V's got control my bass
My break is comin' get busy no time ta waste
Now's the time do bodywork here's the place

Make it funky

Make it funky enough so the tracks lay tough
'Cause I'm tossin' it up and the Ice don't bluff
The girl charmer toy Harmer, juice strong as armor
When I stand upon the stage you could call it melodrama
Intense suspense my voice immense
I wouldn't have you come and see me under false pretense
The girlies do be wildin' as I'm profilin'
Limos lined around the block for about a mile and a half
Autographs the list goes on
If you forgot it, "make it funky" is the name of this song
Stupid dope and you know it, it rates a ten
You pray my DJ cuts the records so it starts again
'Cause I can keep the mic cookin' for an entire month
My rhymes are always hard hittin' I don't know how to bunt
My DJ cuts like a laser E-V-I-L-E
Put your finger on the records
Make it, make it funky
Make it funky
A child was born in the East one day
Moved to the West coast after his parents passed away
Never understood his fascination with rhymes or beats
In poetry he was considered elite
Became a young gangster in the streets of L.A
Lost connections with his true roots far away
But no matter the job or crime
He never lost his hardcore obsession to rhyme
New York's hip hop movement broke loose
DJ's cut records, raps had the juice
Since busting rhymes was his natural thing
He was crowned the west coast MC king
But after his inauguration there was a rush
Of wack rappers with one intention to crush
This master rapper and take his throne
A simple job,he had no crew, he stood all alone
Assassins came in groups of one through five
With raps no mortal MC could survive
But he showed no mercy, he rapped blood thirsty
Battling from Friday on through to Thursday
Never losin a bout, never ending in doubt
Every confrontation K.O. knock out
On his never ending journey to the T.O.P
The L.A. player M.C. ICE-T

[Verse One]
Magnificent rhymer, I'm the ill beat designer
If they ask you if I'm def, don't front and say kinda
Merciless, meticulous, so fresh it's ridiculous
I'm raised in the heart of Los A-N-G-E-L-E-S
King word connector, the vocal projector
Your girl tried to jock me, I had to reject her
Always adventurous voice some say is sensuous
Now, I'm on the mic so I think I better mention this
I don't like Gucci, Fila, Louis, or Fendi
Those are fads and I ain't trendy
But whether your name's Lucy, Terry, Laura, or Cindy
Ice got the beef and this ain't Wendy's
Bust a move while I'm talkin'
Sucker rappers I be stalkin'
When they see me on the street with my homeboy walkin'
They slow down, turn around and ask was that Ice?
Then they see me cold countin' my cash
Rhyme pays!

[Verse Two]
Moves must be busted, girls can't be trusted
I looked at your lady and I was disgusted
Came into the party just to rock the place
And your big zombie lookin' freak still won't get out of my face
I don't mean to diss her, but do you kiss her?
Look at her lips, she got them crazy blisters
Body that smells like the New York Mets
Arm pits all nappy packed full of sweat
I hope this something that you never forget
Tie that freak outside next time you come in the set
Because my jams be crazy, packed with all fly ladies
I'm talkin' def girlies and I don't mean maybe
The way I rhyme no one will ever slay me
And I ain't lyin' rhymes do pay me !
Rhyme pays!

[Verse Three]
I'm notorious, I'm infamous, like a snake I'm venomous
For those who may diss I think you should consider this
I can make a rhyme complicated as a puzzle
Dangerous and as violent as a pit bull in a muzzle
But this record is for radio S-T-E-R-E-O
It's not to be banned or for some underground mix show
My heart's in my pen every time I begin
Sometimes my lyrics go crazy and I just can't control 'em my friend
I try to edit what I'm rappin' about
But I can't write polite my anger just jumps out!
Perpetrators in the business claim they're hard as hell
Talkin' that gangster shit, know'n they're soft as jell-
Oh! I better chill out before I ill out
And my negative potential just might spill out
And then this record won't be gettin played
I'll save that rap for another day

Rhyme pays

[Verse Four]
The front stage area goes into hysteria
As I start to rhyme and unleash my criteria
Of what is to come during the beat of the drum
And Evil agitates the records with the use of his thumb
Using his intricate moves, the record stays in the groove
My boy cuts like Jason, it's easy to prove
That Evil E is the great, his cuts are real not fake
Not emulated effects or a play back tape
So suckers witness your fate while Evil demonstrates
I'm bout to get off this mic, E., dog the break - Kick it!

[Verse Five]
Like me if ya want'a, diss me if you're gonna
But my jam will still be kickin' on your neighborhood corner
As my bass is max'n out the V.U.S. on your box
There'll be no doubt within your mind whether this MC do rock
Like granite, I planned it, So you could understand it
If someone's talkin' when I'm rhymin'
Then just say, "Damn shut up!"
While Ice is breakin' the boy don't be fakin'
Maybe they're just jealous of the dollars I'm makin'
But you're down with me. You know god gifted me
Black kids say I'm trech, white kids say I'm nifty
Spell out my name ya go I-C-E T
But right now it's time for Evil E to hit me!

[Verse Six]
Rhyme pays, buys my food every night and day
It pays my rent my bills I guess I'm doin' ok
But when I say rhyme pays, I mean in different ways
Cause rappin' gets a lot of kids out of the streets each day
It makes me feel real nice when someone likes the Ice
Or some young MC asks me for advice
But there will always be rappers who hate Ice T
Maybe I dogged 'em in a battle or just jealousy
Inevitable situation, sucker rapper frustration
I rhyme too tough to bite, too intricate for notation
Syllables jumble, competitors crumble as they witness mic attack
And the microphone rumbles like hurricane
I maim, sometimes I go insane
Step toward my rap and I inflict the pain!
No shame Ice capital T's my name!!
...Damn there I go illin' out again
Rhyme Pays
Deuce deuce revolver
Was my problem solver
Had a def girl, really didn't
Wanna involve her

In the life of a gangster
Used to rob bankster
But now I'm locked up
I'm just a punk low rankster

Jail cells
Know me too damn well
Seems like I've built on earth
My own personal hell

No matter how high I climbed
Somehow I always fell
Guess a lot of players got
This story to tell

No matter how cold you roll
You simply cannot win
It's always fun in the beginning
But pain in the end
Pain (x4)

Organized crimer
Big trouble finder
In and out of institutions
Ever since I was a minor

But now I'm on the bricks
Deep in the mix
Crime-smart, searching hard
For some new street tricks

I think I'll join a gang
Sling a little cane
Put a beeper on my belt
And get myself a name

Fresh sneakers, silk shirts
24/7 work
Nine-to-five to survive?
You gotta be a jerk!

I clock two grand a day
Yes I was born to play
Who me? At Micky D's?
It wouldn't work, no way
I'm a big money haver
But not the last laugher
For me infamy
Makes me no autographer

Custody haunts my dreams
Nightmares of capture
Paranoid of surveillance
Phobia of cameras

My bank's bigger
But so are my fears
Past records prove players
Live limited years

But I'm unlike the rest
Known to be the best
Fast money, true wealth
My eternal quest

I hustle all night long
There ain't no gain in rest
12 gauge close range
Blood's on my chest

I looked into his face
I thought he was my friend!
My boy had me set up!
This wound would never mend
No matter who you trust
You simply cannot win
It's always fun in the beginning
But it's pain in the end

Pain (x4)

Gold rope wearer
Neighborhood terror
Can't hang around my mother
Cause she says I scare her

Got a light sunburn
From too much pool-side sittin'
Cordless phone keeps me on
Cause there ain't no quittin'

Mind's in a money mode
Seems like it should explode
Girlies on my jammie--
Got a female overload

Young street messiah
Professional liar
19, got a Benz
21, I'll retire

Crazy money it ain't funny
Suckers lovin' my jock
But there's some people at my door
That didn't even knock!

Task force boomin'
Doggin' my crib out
Can't shout!
F.B.I.'s got a gun in my mouth

Threw me on the floor
Called my girl a whore
Pulled ten G's out my mattress
And was lookin' for more

Cracked my safe with an axe
Then they laughed to the max!
When they seem my money kickin' it
In twenty-G stacks

Booked me on ten counts
With bails of different amounts
The charges stuck like glue--
Some that I couldn't pronounce!

They threw my ass the book
My life was surely took
Then they gave my girl ten years
For hangin' out with a crook

She played the game herself
Fast lane quick wealth
No respect for the law
Or the city's health

The sweat of hustler's greed
Is not reserved for men
It's always fun in the beginning
But it's pain in the end

Pain (x5)

Yeah, that ain't nothin'!
Cause when I get outta here, I'mma get right back in the money
Cause they don't know that I know what time it is, ya see
I done learned something. I did half my time, but I can learn more when I was in here
And I'mma go right back out and get paid, you understand what I'm sayin'? Cause I did half my time. Word!
I only got nine years left
PAIN
Ya heard the Ice was rockin', ticket sales were high
Bought some fresh Adidas so you could look fly
Broke out from your crib rushin' to get here
Tripped ans stumbled almost broke your neck comin' down the stairs
Jumped into your ride, pushed the speed to the limit
Jumped out of your car faster than you jumped in it
Now you're at the jam but in for a shock
Stupid big line wrapped around the block
Through the walls of the hall you could hear me rhyme
Methodically you schemed a way to cut in line
But when you got inside the sight straightened your curls
Cause as you look around all you could see were girls

I love ladies

I think it's time that I tell the truth
I been dissin' females since my early youth
But you know that's a drag and there's no doubt
Cause girlies are the one thing that I can't do without
Female companionship is my one vice
I love to buy the girls things, love to treat em real nice
Homeboys you must admit the best part of each day
Is when a beautiful lady comes walkin' your way
Females possess that one commodity that no man will ever have
Not that hangs around me
They got it, we want it, they move it, and flaunt it
They shake it and sway it, we'll die just to lay it
We try to supress it until they undress it
And beg 'em to use it, and cry not to lose it
No man can deny it so don't even try it!!!
I love ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)
I Love Ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)
That sounds nice (You know we love you Ice!!)

I'm junkie for females and that's a fact
I'm not into havin' my homeboys rubbin' my back
Don't dig goin' to the movies alone
Or talkin' to myself on the telephone
Goin' to a disco that's packed with men
That's like tryin' to get a dance in the federal pen
Walkin' through a park with a gang of the guys
And a beach full of fellas never opened my eyes
And man if females are one thing that you don't need
You better get away from me at a high rate of speed
Cause if you don't like them you must like men
And homeboy that's where our serious problems begin
Because to me women are God's true gift
There's absolutely no question who I'd rather be with

I love ladies

I seen this fly girl walkin' down the street
Jammin' a box rockin' to the beat
The girl looked pretty, she really looked nice
So I said to myself she's got to be with the Ice
Walked over to her, started sayin' my rhyme
She said "Ice you're so bad, you damn near blew my mind"
I kept on rappin', runnin' my mouth
The next thing I knew I was at her house
Looked at her closely, said for goodness sake
The girl was cut like a diamond, had curves like a snake
Her top half was heaven, the bottom was the hell
I knew tonight that the Ice was gonna rock well
But then she started talkin' mess about love and romance
Until she noticed the bulge growin' in my pants
You should'a seen the girl's eyes as my body expanded
She grabbed for my leg, raw sex she demanded
My knees started knockin', I tried to run
She said "Please don't leave Ice, I want you to come"
This girl meant business I had no doubt
This is just about the time that the Ice passed out
The next day I woke the girl was through
Room still smokin', my legs black and blue
My eyes bloodshot, my hair pressed straight
My knees still knockin', I knew I lost weight
She was the best y'all, yes on this earth
I would'a paid a million dollars, that's what it was worth
If I had got her name or number it would'a been nice
But I'm here to let you know the girl went off on the Ice
I love ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)
I Love Ladies
Ladies are you with me? (Yeeaahh!!)
That sounds nice (You know we love you Ice!!)

No when it comes to partyin' the ladies know how
When I ask for a reply they always scream owww!!
It's the homeboys always tryin' to act real chill
Sometimes it's jealous MC's mad cause they ain't on the bill
Maybe they scared if they say ho!
They might lose their cool
But I got some news for you: a fool's a fool
But don't get me wrong, most fellas do rock
They put their hands in the air, they take the show to the top
They start rockin' with the ladies once the show begins
They don't stand lookin' stupid like some mannequins
They don't lean against the wall like they're I some trance
They did not come with no intention to party or dance
You know what? yo dead beats should just stay home
Leave me, my homeboys, and the ladies alone

We love ladies

[Ice-T]
Yeah, Shit is going down again!
This motherfuckers want me back in! Fuck!

[Method Man: Word up, our niggas is strapped, ready for war!] 4x
Get out the H-K!

We used to break em at craps

[Ice-T]
Made another car-hit
30 Killers on the hip
Ready to rock, packin, Magnums and Glocks
Mad connections who trips the question
Niggas on the way to play with the laser ray

[Big Rich]
Nigga you got two strikes and I got two strikes
We can't afford to leave no fuckin witness tonight
But if this is what they want is like Christmas to me
It's been a long time since the Big Rich caught a body

[Ice-T]
Fuck it, I Like the way you think my man
I pack 20 motherfuckers in an Astro Van
We pass the crib about 12:30, dirty
Nigga be ready to roll, I know you heard me!

[Big Rich]
Nigga it's on, so don't trip I'm down
I got to sawed off shawty and I'm ready to clown
Blast the nigga in his Face, kill his fuckin whore
Ice, you done did this kind of shit with me before!

[Method Man: Word up, our niggas is strapped, ready for war!] 8x
They want me back in!
Niggas want me back in!
They want me back in!
Damn!

[Ice-T]
Niggas wanne ill, but my niggas get iller
Streets full of hardcore stone-face Killers
One Love my nigga Big Rich puff bud
I don't get high, I wanne see some niggas die!

[Big Rich]
Yo, some niggas hit the corner with the lights of Ice
That shit don't look nuthin nice
But if this niggas wanne rollin my Hood
Yo then fuck it
Brake out the hardware boys
Blow up the fuckin buck it

[Ice-T]
Niggas pulled out but my crew is ready
Return the fire
Rock the punks steady
When the shootin stop, car look like confetti
Went my ass home jump back in the bed G

[Big Rich]
Fuck why they wanna fuck with us
When they know my posse is crazy and they down to bust
Big Rich take no shit from these busta ass tricks
Check a punk ass nigga like we check a bitch

[Ice-T]
I got no love for no nigga flippin, trippin on my fam
Got damn, I make L.A. hot as Vietnam
But ill niggas should be left alone
Please excuse me, while I rest my dome!

[Method Man: Word up, our niggas is strapped, ready for war!] 8x
They want me back in
Niggas want me back in
They want me back in
Why......niggas want me back in?
Yo Evil, what's up man? They be buggin', they won't play our records on the radio, man, say we violent, man. They need to look at the news, you know what I'm sayin'? Somebody need to kill that noise. Man what you doin' with that up under your shirt? Aw, man, it's time we put some head out, word. Let's get busy, E. Come on, home boy

Squeeze the trigger

Man I'm tired of this nonsense, sweatin' my crew, tryin' to come to the show, searchin' my car, man I'm sick of the cops

Rampage on stage, my crew's in a rage
Searched my posse, found the Uzi but missed the 12 gauge
Maniac, I'm a rhyme brainiac, livin' on the edge of a razor, remember that
Cold rollin' thick as a shake, I'm rockin' hard as a quake
I can live on bread and water or lobster and steak
My mind's a riot gun, there ain't none bigger
About to unload the ammo, E squeeze the trigger

("You fight...") Got 'im! ("...to live.")
"Police still have no leads for the apprehension of the south side slayer. Death total stands at ten."
"Has it ever occured to you? The president might be the one who wants you dead."

They say I'm violent, they should watch the T.V
You say I'm brutal, you should check your P.D
You made me, now your kids rave me
I rap about the life that the city streets gave me
Murder, intrigue, somebody must bleed
Miami Vice is small time, L.A.'s the big league
From the Rollin' '60s to the Nickerson G's
Pueblos, Grape Street, this is what I see
The Jungle, the '30s, the V.N.G
Life in L.A. ain't no cup of tea
And they be sayin' I'm illin', yo
Squeeze the trigger
Got 'im!

"Violence erupts at a Los Angeles hip-hop concert. Rap music is blamed for violence
Violence erupts at a New York hockey game. Hockey is blamed for violence
Violence breaks out at a European soccer game. Soccer is blamed for violence
Violence breaks out at a nuclear peace rally. Peace is blamed for violence."

I've been dogged out by cops, shackled and socked
Paid my dues to the streets, took my hard knocks
Disrespected by snobs, damn near trampled by mobs
Persecuted by squares workin' nine to five jobs
But like a panther I prowl, like a lion I growl
Learn to see behind my back like the head of an owl
I'm the voice of the youth, the prophet of truth
What I speak is reality though some may say ruth-
-less tactics are takin' by me to awaken
People to life but I feel no fakin'
No jivin', no lyin', no frontin', no playin'
Say exactly what's up, understand what I'm sayin'
Ban me, try it, you might cause a riot
What the radio won't play, the underground will supply it
I'm an MC pirate that's loud, not quiet
Radical as they make'em, make a rule I'll defy it
Critics may say I'm wise, some may call my words lies
I've lived more in one day than they will in their lives
With most due respect the words I inject
Kick credit for realism and the truth I project
Because I could bust rhymes for fun, or cut MC's like a knife
But the topic I love is the drama of life
So don't diss me don't dare, I feel you should care
You may think I'm soft but you're just unaware
Of the wrath of the Ice enraged, prepare
For a true nightmare
Squeeze the trigger

Cops hate kids, kids hate cops, cops kill kids with warnin' shots
What is crime and what is not? What is justice? I think I forgot
We buy weapons to keep us strong
Reagan sends guns where they don't belong
The controversy is thick and the drag is strong
But no matter the lies we all know who's wrong
Homeless sleep on the city streets
Waitin' to die with nothin' to eat
While rich politicians soak their feet
In the pools at their ten million buck retreats
People hate people for color of face
No one had a choice in the race we were placed
A brother in Queens was beaten and chased
Murdered cold in the streets, a goddamn disgrace
Just because of his race, his life went to waste
And not one went to jail when the court heard the case
Justice or corruption? It's all interlaced
How can you swallow this? I can't stand the taste

Squeeze the trigger

"L.A. drug war continues. Three killed in execution style murders. Film at eleven."
"All flights are delayed at LAX, due to terrorist bombings. Five adults and two children are dead."
I get paid for illin', cold makin' a killin'
My pockets keep fillin', I got dollars to the ceilin'
Got a safe in my floor, car got bullet-proof doors
Every time I rock the mic I leave you wishin' for more
'Cause my raps ain't bull, got cold stupid pull
You wanna eat my rhymes like candy, 'til your mind's over full
But most MC's today ain't got nothin' to say
A to the motherfuckin' K

Get him!

Yo E, man, i'm tired of this, let's call up the posse, let's end this noise, word

Now you think you know what time it is? Word, we out of here

"Los Angeles rapper Ice-T's records banned because of his blatant use of reality"

[Outro]
This album is dedicated to Rhyme Syndicate
They hear my records before they're made
When they're just on paper, when they're demos laid
At 6am when the cops run their raid
We don't worry about suckas 'cause they will get sprayed
PEACE

[Dialougue: Ice-T]
Godfather's in the house..
Grab yo' bitches

Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man
Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man
Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man
Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man


Take a look at me, everything I own's iced out
Pimp baby, you can see my wrists with the lights out
This is how I do it, mad bitches and clothes
Godfather baby, only play to my rogues
Step back, hater make a little room for my hoes
Gators on my feet, take a look at my toes
Money is the reason all the real players know that
Godfather lays punks to rest
He got no chance up against the best
I rocks in the East and I rolls in the West
If you don't dig the pimpin I could really care less
Cause it's, pimp or die, pimp or die baby
Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man (repeat 3X)
Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy..

G-O-D, F-A-T-H-E-R
Hoes start runnin when they see my car
Even though I'ma pro wrestling star
They know I, don't play and I gotta get paid
Everything I wear baby's tailor made
I come into your town and go off like a grenade
And anyone who steps on the mat they get laid
Let me pimp or let me die that's the game I chose
Condos, speedboats, and beautiful hoes
Cartier wristwear, furs and gold
And mad cash baby too much to fold
Cause it's, pimp or die, pimp or die baby

Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man (repeat 3X)
GRAB YO BITCHES!

Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man (repeat 3X)
BIG PIMPIN JUMPIN OFF!

Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man (repeat 3X)
GODFATHER's IN THE HOUSE, BITCH!

Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man (repeat 3X)
Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy..
Break yourself bitch!
..

Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man (repeat 3X)
Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't - pimp or die baby

Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man (repeat 3X)
GRAB YO BITCHES!

Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man (repeat 3X)
BIG PIMPIN JUMPIN OFF!

Pimpin ain't pimpin ain't easy man (repeat 5X)
GRAB YO BITCHES!

[Intro]
Oooooohhhh, oooooohhhh
Oooooohhhh, oooooohhhh

[Ice-T]
It's going down, yo, the girl got a gun
Best run, because she is, quick to flip and empty out the clip
And make the men understand where she is coming from
The hardcore is connected to the base of her fate
She just breaks and brings drama to the situation
Ejaculation of her projectile, she buckwild
Better recognize that she comes, she comes correct
Collects respect, and if not, you'll catch a broken neck, buddy
Look down and your shirt is all bloody
Looks like she caught you with the bad one
For messing with the mad one
Told you about this girl before, you didn't listen to me as I talk
Now you stalked, by the hunter of the fronter
Who's size five and sexy
Quick to catch your body and another one next week
Huh, it doesn't matter cause the girl stays strapped
She said she had enough of men and now she's looking for payback (WORD!!)
And there's no way that you can fade her son
She walks softly but she carries the big gun

[Chorus: Hen-G X2]
She walks softly but she carries the big gun
She walks softly but she carries the big gun
She walks softly but she carries the big gun

[Ice-T] And there's no way that you can fade her son

[Ice-T]
The most venemous feminist, homey she ain't soft
You give her trouble then she might cut your head off
Or something that you like to think's the best
She'll blow big holes in your shest (*Gun Shot*)
She said she gotta cause she says a lot of ladies won't
She said she gotta cause she says a lot of ladies don't
She said she gotta cause she says a lot of ladies can't
She said she gotta cause she knows a lot of ladies
Romance the thoughts of giving men their own medicine
Electrocute them, light them up like Con Edison
She got no fear, five rings in her ear
Holes in her nose, way out clothes
Living life to the fullest, buckshots and bullets
Triggers she'll pull it, Earth she wanna rule it
Maybe she will, cause she is quick to kill
The city lights make her dresses tight, yes she bites
You'll never know where she'll coming from
She walks softly but she carries the big gun

[Chorus: Hen-G X2]

[Ice-T]
She got no time to trip or argue, you're through
I bet she gets you
Homeboy'll catch a stretcher like so many before
She is on the Bodycount tour, but not rock
She couldn't suck the punks and cops
You say she is nothing but a woman then you'll come up shot
You say why you wanna kill me? - and she says why not!
Pop, she got a body that'll make you cry
Pop, she got a shotty that'll make you die
Don't bring drama to her homey, cause you'll wind up flat
She'll put your ass horizontal then she'll pull your cap
She got no love, and love is something that she never had
She loved the mother but she hated the motherfucking dad
So stay the hell out of her way, cause the girl don't play, none
She walks softly but she carries the big gun

[Chorus: Hen-G W/variation X2]
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
She walked softly but she carried the big gun

[Ice-T] So don't even try to play her son
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
She walked softly but she carried the big gun
She walked softly but she carried the big gun

[Ice-T] So don't even try to front son
Yeah
Too many hardcore muthafuckas out here in this business
Ain't gettin their proper loot
You know what I'm sayin?
(Right)
Check the technique
(Aha)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Everybody talkin 'bout the way hip-hop ain't the same
Suckers kidnapped the game
I know the biggest in the business, and no joke
Half of em broke - and none of em smoke
(Bust the facts, loc)
I got into this hip-hop game
Just to try to get a girl and get some light-weight fame
There'd never been no cash made in it
So who thought you could get paid with it?
Just crash the club with my crew and then I'm outta there
Hit some skins, act bugged, that was a rap career
Then Run-D.M.C. jumped the fuck off
Got mad paid, word, kicked the bucks off
There wasn't many rappers out there rockin the streets
When hip-hop was just cuts and beats
I seen _Wildstyle_, dug the scene
I wanna be an MC, rock, rock on - know what I mean?
I started crashin rap contests
Shootin hardcore rhymes through wack MC's chests
I signed on the lines of a wack contract
Didn't even read it, fuck that
They gonna put my record out
I'm gonna be large, know what I'm talkin about?
In the first 2 years I made about 300 bucks
Yo, this business sucks
But I got another chance and I came correct
Got a lawyer and accountant, now my shit's legit
But many won't get no second chance
And get fucked in this biz without a kiss or a dance
The game is to exploit young ghetto kids
A straight pimp game, and there ain't no shame
And the shit's gone too far
100 hip-hop labels with all white A&R's
The game's hijacked
The rap game's hijacked

Let me tell you how it happened

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now while every MC in the game
Was worryin about a white boy gettin the fame
They dug out the foundation
Now let me give a demonstration
Say you got a dope group from the hood
Talkin mad shit like they're up to no good
You take em to a label
Now who sits behind the table?
Some jewish muthafucka that don't know shit
Tryin to tell y'all what's a fuckin street hit
The shit's way off course
It's like me tellin Johnny Cash how to sing about his horse
You go on tour, the white agency says you're wild
Tone down your style
The radio jocks are all pop
So how the fuck this nigga know what shit to rock?
The shit that make your face turn green
Is when you get dissed by a kidnap magazine
I give a fuck about these muthafuckas
I'm doin this jam to save my hip-hop brothers
Get your paperwork straight, kid
Get a lawyer and accountant just like I did
Don't blow your dough, cause you will see g's
But this game has no guarantees
Learn about publishing points, so you won't be blind
Learn to read everything you sign
Then you might have a chance
If not, bend over, pull down your pants
The game's hijacked
(Yeah
I don't they hear you, brother)
Yo, the rap game's hijacked
(Word)
I'm talkin 'bout a hijack
(Say it one more time, baby)
The rap game's hijacked
Check it
(Break it down for these niggas)

[ VERSE 3 ]
You can go gold and still owe the record label cash
Yo kid, check the math
Learn about the word 'recoup', troop
And stop walkin round all hyped and souped
You ain't nothin but somethin to be used and worked
You ain't nothin but a sucker to be duped and jerked
Cause the fuckin record label don't love ya, pal
They didn't love ya on the street and don't love ya now
They're out to make an end, friend
Cause every dollar you make, they damn near make 10
They'll take you for everything you got
Or else they'll sign you and they put on the shelf to rot
I'm tryin to tell you what's up
You best to listen to this record even if you hate my fucking guts
Cause I just can't stand around and watch rap get done
And my brothers ain't gettin none
A nigga like me has gotta spit game
Nigga, get that cash flow. fuck that muthafuckin fame
Cause the white man's rippin us off once again
Real hip-hop, my man
Fool, the rap game's hijacked
You need to listen, nigga
The rap game's hijacked
Need to play this record about ten times
The rap game's hijacked
Black people don't own shit
The rap game's hijacked
Check it

R&B's hijacked
Black acting is hijacked
Just being black is hijacked
(Build, my nigga, build, my nigga)
Nigga
Stupid muthafuckas, they rippin us off
You better get a end..
While the money's there, boy
Silly-ass bitch runnin around with a gold chain
All niggas gotta get some real estate
Muthafucka
Come up
Fuck a bitch
Better get somethin you can own, asshole
White man ain't givin up shit
Word o' life
Although I got a white engineer
But he's gettin minimum wage
So it's cool...

Yeah
Shit's been hijacked

[Intro]
Yo Iz, let's do this

[Verse 1: Ice-T]
I am a nightmare walkin', psychopath talkin'
King of my jungle, just a gangster stalkin'
Livin' life like a firecracker, quick is my fuse
Vendettas of death back; the colors I choose
Red or Blue, Cuz or Blood, it just don't matter
Sucka dive for your life when my shotgun scatters
The gangs of L.A. will never die - just multiply

[Interlude: Ice-T]
You see they hit us then we hit them
Then we hit them and they hit us, man
It's like a war, ya know what I'm sayin'
People don't even understand
They don't even know what they dealing with
You wanna get rid of the gangs it's gonna take a lotta work
But people don't understand the size of this
This is no joke man, this is real

[Verse 2: Ice-T]
You don't know me, fool
You disown me, cool
I don't need your assistance, social persistence
Any problem I got I just put my fist in
My life is violent but violent is life
Peace is a dream, reality is a knife
My colors, my honor, my colors, my all
With my colors upon me one soldier stands tall
Tell me what have you left me, what have I got?
Last night in cold blood my young brother got shot
My homeboy got jacked
My mother's on crack
My sister can't work cause her arms show tracks
Madness insanity, live in profanity
Then some punk claimin' they're understandin' me
Give me a break, what world do you live in
Death is my set, guess my religion

[Interlude: Ice-T]
Yo my brother was a gang banger
And all my homeboys bang
I don't know why I do it man, I just do it
I never had much of nothing man
Look at you man, you've got everything going for yourself
And I ain't got nothing man, I've got nothing
I'm living in the ghetto man
Just look at me man, look at me

[Verse 3: Ice-T]
My pants are saggin', braided hair
Suckas stare but I don't care
My game ain't knowledge, my game's fear
I've no remorse so squares beware
But my true mission is just revenge
You ain't in my set, you ain't my friend
Wear the wrong color your life could end
Homicide's my favorite binge

[Interlude: Ice-T]
Listen to me man
No matter whatcha do don't ever join a gang
You don't wanna be in it man
You're just gonna end up in a mix of dead friends and time in jail
I know, if I had a chance like you
I would never be in a gang man
But I didn't have a chance
You know I wish I did

[Verse 4: Ice-T]
I'll just walk like a giant, police defiant
You'll say to stop but I'll say that I can't
My gang's my family, it's all that I have
I'm a star, on the walls is my autograph
You don't like it, so you know where you can go
Cause the streets are my stage and terror's my show
Psycho-analyze tried diagnosin' me, why?
It wasn't your brother that brutally died
But it was mine, so let me define
My territory; don't cross the line
Don't try to act crazy cause that shit don't faze me
If you ran like a punk, it wouldn't amaze me
Cause my colors death
Though we all want peace
But our war won't end
'Till all wars cease

[Interlude: Ice-T]
See the wars of the street gangs will always get to me, man
But I don't wanna be down with this situation man
But I'm in here, if I had something better to do I think I'd do it But right now, I'm just down here boy
I'm trying to get money cause I'm smart
I'm gonna get paid while I'm out here
I'm gonna get that paper, ya know what I'm saying
If I had a chance like you
Maybe I would be in school
But I'm not, I'm out here living day to day surviving
And I'm willing to die for my colors

[Outro]
Yo, please stop cause I want y'all to live
This is Ice-T, peace

[Verse One: Ice-T]
My mafiaso, rap Cosa Nostro
As we went deadly, cops would say ohh so
Cities we terrorized, concerts we mesmerized
My word is my bond, because the Ice speaks no lies
I kick flavor while the crew watch my back
Kid Jazz, Everlast, Low Pro, Nat the Cat
Donald Dee, Bronx Style Bob, T.D.F
Spinmasters, Bango, my man Def Jef
You want trouble; we got it
You hear a gun; we shot it
Wreckin' and deckin' and sucker ducks we rejectin'
We're clockin' crazy respect'n, collecting money we check in
Dissing, dogging, microphone hogging
Radically speaking, monitor peeking
You get 'noid, worried and scaried
Beats are too different, styles too varied
What ya gonna do? - I'd run if I were you
It's '88 punk! Syndicate is coming through

[Chorus: Evil-E]
Rhyme Syndicate.. yeah, is coming through
Rhyme Syndicate.. yeah.. coming.. coming.. coming through
Rhyme Syndicate.. Rhyme Syndicate.. Rhyme Syndicate..
Yeah.. is coming through

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Evil-E cuts the records, the boy don't be joking
I write the lyrics, my Bic can be smoking
Went on the Deuce, Islam drops the token
And after the jam Syndicate cold be strokin'
Cold cooling while the girlies be drooling
Take 'em ten at a time in the room for some schooling
The hall, the wall, the floor, the pool
And back at the Limo' we got the girls drooling for..

[Chorus: Evil-E]

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
I got a rhymes like spectacular, high grade vernacular
Records I rap for ya, movies I act for ya
You say you're def? - it might be a fact ya are
Prepared to lose your blood because my rhymes bite like Dracula
Don't claim intelligence, cause that's irrelevant
Where power's mandatory just to kick lyrics so elegant
Impressive, aggressive, suckers suppressant
You're talking mess I think that you'd simply do your best to get it
Cold shut up, before the boys nut up
Trying to diss the posse just can get your butt cut up
Rhyme Syndicate's the name of the crew
These simple words of wisdom were delivered to you
Cause..

[Chorus: Evil-E until fade]

[Intro Ice-T, DJ Evil E, Ice-T & DJ Evil E]
One-two, one-two, in the place to be, my name is MC Ice-T
And my name is DJ Evil E
And on the beat rocks, the man, there's none hotter
Son of Bambaataa, prince of charm, Afrika Islam, oh yeah
But wait a minute, E, what's up with this girl right here?
Oh, man, she look pretty down, man (Oh baby, baby, baby)
I think that's what I want (Baby, baby, that's what I want)
Sex in the morning, sex at night
Sex in the afternoon's alright
Ain't a man on Earth that can stay alive
Without a sex drive

[Chorus: Ice-T & DJ Evil E, Ice-T, DJ Evil E]
Sex
Sex
Sex
See (Uh)

[Verse 1: Ice-T, DJ Evil E]
I was in a contest to rock the world
First prize was a virgin young girl
For four days I was up on the mic
All sucker MCs was on the bite
Bitin' all my rhymes, stealin' my style
Bitin' on the Ice like a crocodile
You know I rock so hard, it wasn't true
Won the virgin girl and her mama too

[Chorus: Ice-T & DJ Evil E, Ice-T, DJ Evil E]
Sex
Sex (That's what I want)
Sex (Oh, yeah)
Sex

[Verse 2: Ice-T, DJ Evil E]
When I'm upon the microphone
All the fly young girlies wanna take me home
Party's over, take me to the house
Throw me in the bed, know what we're talkin' about?
Then they say, "Ice-T you are the best
I love your eyes, your thighs, your chest
You put all my lovers to shame
I can't remember my boyfriend's name
You made me feel all hot and wet
The way you move, I can't forget
I came and came, I came again
Felt so good I told my friends
You can have my cars, my jewels, my wealth
I love you more than I love myself
After tonight, fulfilled I'll be
No hundred men could match Ice-T"

[Chorus: Ice-T & DJ Evil E, Ice-T, DJ Evil E]
Sex
Sex (That's what she wanted)
Sex
Sex

[Verse 3: Ice-T, DJ Evil E]
Then she turned out the lights, threw back the sheets
And then our two hot bodies meet
All at once she felt the thrill
The caress of the best, the Ice-T chill
Startin' with the tongue up on the back of my leg
You didn't stop 'til I hollered, screamed and begged
Then she rolled me over, took me to the stage
Like in the nasty book where you tore out the page

[Chorus: Ice-T & DJ Evil E, Ice-T, DJ Evil E]
Sex
Sex
Sex (That's what I want, yeah, brother)
Sex (Oh)

[Verse 4: Ice-T, DJ Evil E]
I put it in they blouse or in they bra
In their little panties that they boyfriend saw
Send it through the mini skirt, up their thigh
Deep, deep girls, I wanna make you cry
Move it in and out, know what I'm talkin' about?
I'm in around your neck until you show respect
Then on your cheek until I reach my peak
Then in your mouth, girl, no joke
I take it out, girl, don't want to see you choke
I'll run it down your back, might cause a heart attack
I put it in your butt until I get enough
And then I'll take it out and put it in my pants
'Cause I fuck with the beat, the only way to dance

[Chorus: Ice-T & DJ Evil E]
Sex
Sex
Sex
Sex

[Intro: Trigger Tha Gambler, M.O.P.]

SWITZERLAND!! (AWWWWWWWWWW!!)
COME ON SCREAM!! (AWWWWWWWWWW!!)
Yo T, let's do this shit baby, dog

[Verse One: Ice-T]
Is it new year God? I'm coming back mad hard
Moving harder than a convict with a shack in the yard
New Jacks wanna hear me rap, begging for freestyle skills
I've served so many rappers, I can make a land field, fool
You've doubt for a mic dude, the Ice is a jewel
Fuck rules, I got more pool than a mule
Matter of fact, you never comprehend the styles I sin
I keep breaking to annihilate fakes and teens
The Yellow nigga from the Westside cheered, I peel libs
What praying that you do, yo when I all ready did
Like your girl gotta admit she was a sexy bitch
But I hit it with the Jimmy so my nuts don't itch
So just check as I pore for the mic core
THE NIGGAZ!! THE NIGGA!! THE NIGGA!!
Six ounces, squeeze the trigger
For you hardcore motherfuckers that's been dying for.. this gangster shit
Time to squab and rob and fight, hit til you through
I got a strain in my brain like pain
But niggas sucking up my shit like I'm some crack cocaine
To you white kids, you better watch your head
As you popping down the street by these words I said

[Break: Trigger Tha Gambler, M.O.P.]
MONTREUX MAKE SOME GODDAMN NOISE!!
YEAH!! COME ON!! UHH!!
GET THEM UP Y'ALL!! YEAH!!
COME ON MAN, LET'S RIP THIS SHIT!!
RIP THIS SHIT UP!!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
Once again I'm back in the place to be
The I, the C, the E, the T
I'll never get a Grammy, so fuck the G
All I need is crowd, and a M-I-C
Got a gangster ass DJ named Evil-E
My record label's called Warner B
William Morris is my agent
I'll never go broke, I got property
Got a dope pitbull named Felony
Got four gold albums, so what you're telling me?
Power was two, Iceberg was three
This one here shipped five hundred G
Now when I roll, I roll stupid deep
Benz's, Bemers, and booming Jeeps
I'm always strapped, cause my money I keep
You move on the Ice, and you're going to sleep
But when you see me walking down the street
You say, "What's up Ice?" -- what would I say, "Peace!"
You give me a dap, I give you one back
Cause I ain't souped, so forget about that
We might take a picture or sign an autograph
Kick a little flavor to have some fun and laugh
But step to me wrong, you might get shot
And wind up looking out a ziplock!!!

[Outro]
YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!
WAR!!!

Our government is fucked
Sure to bring us down
The media incites civil unrest
Hatred can bring you down

[Hook]
WAR!!!
I don't want your war
WAR!!!
WE DON'T NEED YOUR WAR
We don't need your war
WAR!!!
Military beasts starvin countries
Drama brings you to your knees
Spill your blood to save humanity
Dyin for the food we feed

[Hook]
Our government is fucked
Sure to bring us down
The media incites civil unrest
Hatred can bring you down
Injustice drives you crazy
It drive L.A. insane
In this generation
Hatred is the name

[Hook]
WAR!!!
L.A. '92
Bastard magic should make you cry
The answer to the question is we ain't gonna die
L.A. '92

Police can make me under stress
While all L.A.'s a fuckin mess
Don't patronise my fuckin ass
Some heads will get crashed
L.A. '92

Bush has got his upper cut
He's goin to fuckin war
He won't revert to sticks and stones
Just bullet holes and broken bones
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos
Don't give a fuck!

Everybody knock ya down
No weight support so taken down
The juk-jock, by locking us up
We ain't got shit, now had enough
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos
Don't give a fuck!

Disorder!!! (x8)
A man took an ad on T.V
To enroll in the police academy
He's very talented, outstanding proof
From his clean-cut apperance to the shine on his boots
When it comes to graduation, he's number one
An expert with a rifle and also a gun
Three weeks on the beat and his weak nerves crack
And fires four warning shots into a kid's back

Killers! These are the killers
Killers! The coldhearted killers
Killers! Bloodthirsty killers
Killers! Beware of the killers

A young girl marries an older man
With more money than you can understand
He smothers her with pearls and jewelry
And they both seemed as happy as they could be
But three months later, she's sad but content
Seems he had an unexpected accident
The girl said he would be hard to forget
As the papers interviewed her while she flew his jet
Killers! These are the killers
Killers! She was the killer
Killers! The coldhearted killers
Killers! Beware of the killers

It's time for all to work together for peace
'Cause everybody's doomed if the killings don't cease
Street homicide, war, it's all the same
'Cause murder is murder by any name

An young man loses his only job
Too proud to hustle, too honest to rob
He goes to tell his family and his wife
But an argument breaks out, she grabs a knife
Tempers escalate to a total rage
Shots burst out from a loaded twelve-gauge
They call it mass murder, suicide
But somebody tell me why the kids had to die

Killers! these are the killers
Killers! the coldhearted killers
Killers! bloodthirsty killers
Killers! beware of the killers

Vietnam vet, home from the war
Can't get a job in a candy store
Unemployment hurts and he's living proof
So to take out his frustration, he climbs on the roof
He shows no pity as victims are shot
The only thing to stop him are the bullets from SWAT
Ten people died on a sunny day
But tell me who taught him how to shoot that way?
Killers! These are the killers
Killers! You know the killers
Killers! Beware of the killers
Killers! Are you a killer?

It's time for all to work together for peace
'Cause everybody's doomed if the killings don't cease
Street homicide, war, it's all the same
'Cause murder is murder by any name

A known criminal is sentenced to death
Now the legal system controls his last breath
He tries to fight execution with petitions and pleas
And a pardon from the governor is all he needs
He cries out for mercy but nothing's spared
And on his day of termination, he's strapped in a chair
High voltage fills his body in a house-like jail
And all of the people of vengeance grail

Are you a killer? a cold-hearted killer
A killer! a bloodthirsty killer
A killer! a merciless killer
A killer! a killer!  A killer!

Georgie-Porgie-Pudding-and-pie
Couldn't get a girl, let me tell you all why
He tried to be down like all the rest
Had curls in his hair, gold on his chest
He rolled around town in a Coup-de-ville
But he had no money, he was broke as hell
Ladies love money and he needed more
So he tried to steal something out a liquor store
But before Georgie-Porgie could get away
The man pulled out his gun and blew him away
He was a killer! A coldhearted killer
A killer! Are you a killer?
A killer! A merciless killer
A killer! Beware of the killers

It's time for all to work together for peace
'Cause everybody's doomed if the killings don't cease
Street homicide, war, it's all the same
'Cause murder is murder by any name

Politicians plot for power each and every day
We are all just puppets in the games they play
They manipulate the message to attain their goals
And for simple re-election they will sell their souls
Nuclear supremacy is the ultimate thrill
So our tax we pay is paid for overkill
B-1 bombers, super weapons, rockets in the sky
While we all pray to God the missiles never fly

Killers! These are the killers
Killers! They are the killers
Killers! Are you a killer?
Killers! Don't be a killer

It's time for all to work together for peace
'Cause everybody's doomed if the killings don't cease
Street homicide, war, it's all the same
'Cause murder is murder by any name

[Hook 2x]
"You gotta make the money first"
"Then when you get the money, you get the power"
"Then when you get the power, Then you get the woman"

[Ice-T]
The problem is you broke, You ain't got no car or job
You slow with your hustle, You dress like a slob
Ladies ain't looking for no brothers like this
They want the dub-twisting ballers with the ice on their wrist
You gotta get your cash right to get in the game
Might have to pull a pistol, Flip some caine
Get out in them streets and hustle hard in the rain
Take your come up and reinvest to the game
"You gotta make the money first"
You need a lot to go far
What you think is rich, I just spent on a car
What you think is paid, I just blew on a watch
What you think is wealthy, I just dropped on a yacht
Flip the street cash and try to pick some stocks
Kick back in your pad and watch it roll like crops
But it really ain't that easy, Or we all would be rich
One mistake, You're broke, The come up's a bitch
Make the right moves and forget about sleep
Concentrate on the paper chase, Join the elite
Few dun got mad cash and money to spend
Money to straight blow and money to lend
And only then, You made it past stage one, My friend

[Hook 2x]

[Ice-T]
Now you got the money and the cash flow thick
But you really ain't nothing but a richer trick
Just because you're paid, you can still get thick
By your low life homies or skanless bitch
You gotta move it around, put it in the right hands
Maybe a judge, Make a PA your friend
Understand what really moves the world
Recognize what really moves these girls
Juice is more important than cash for real
Money you spend, But true power you feel
It ain't that easy to reach
Respect is about the hardest damn thing in the streets to get
Make your moves correct, Watch your crew
Watch your back, They watching you
Anybody round you has gotta be true
Or you never make it past stage two
Listen, when you get the real true power, You know
People will feel you, Wherever you go
And when you really max this game
You'll never have to say your name

[Hook]

[Ice-T]
Now you got the power, It's on, My friend
Cuz the one thing women love is powerful men
The one thing women hate are brothers that bend
They act like they like 'em, But they only pretend
They wanna be with that man in the V.I
They don't wanna stand in line
You outta your mind?
That other player's got cash, But no juice
Cuz the powerful men get to choose
From a multitude of women that be steppin in crews
Willing to do much more than before
Give you quick brains, It's insane
Just what the woman'll do just for you
Cuz if you got the power, Then they gets it too
If you rollin benz, Then they rollin too
If you livin phat, Then they ballin too
That sounds stupid to you, Not to me
They winning one move when it takes us three
Cars, Big houses, And shopping sprees
While most of us see the penitentiary

[Hook 2x]
* also on "That's How I'm Livin'" EP (Japanese release)

[Intro]
Yeah, Syndicate's in the house
Yeah, Geto Boys in the house
Yeah, Donald D's in the house
Yeah, Body count's in the house
Yeah, Zulu Nation's in the house
Yeah, Ice T's in the house, yeah

[Verse One]
You go on and on and you don't stop
Got sticky sneakers from the blood of a shot cop
Bailed in the club, I'm leavin' tracks on the white rug
Punk tried to riff and he met double-aught slugs
I ain't the nigga to step to
Out catchin' bodies and the next one could be you
Quick on the trigger, yo, I'm a gravedigger
Chop up a body and deep six 'em in the river
A night-stalkin' psychopath
All cops hunt the black male in a ski-mask
But I'm too damn clever
Will they ever catch me? Never!
Because I operate in and out of state
Move at a quick rate
And never hesitate to take a chump sucker down
And my H-K it holds 80 rounds
So when you move be careful and don't play
And watch for the ricochet
Suicide, it's a suicide, yeah (x8)

[Verse Two]
So shut up motherfuckers as I lay the ink
When I'm in Detroit, niggas fight in mink
When I'm in Chicago, motherfuckers get buck wild
When I'm up in Oakland, niggas roll in a huge file
In Atlanta, niggas crash the doors
When I'm in Philly, it's a sold out tour
In L.A., I max out real hard
When I'm in New York, I build with the Gods
So don't try to deny me my proper juice
E cuts the records and the yellow nigga gets loose
No static, just much respect
Truck my Rolex when I cruise the projects
A fly brother that's hard to figure
Why I punch hoes and I smack up niggas
Cause I'm a pimp and a playa
Sometimes I bump hip-hop, the other times, Slayer
You don't like it well stay out of my fucking way
Duck from the gunshot and watch for the ricochet

"Being cool, 'cause i'm ice" (yeah!)
"Being cool, 'cause i'm ice, without a doubt" (yeah!)
"Being cool, 'cause i'm ice" (yeah!)
"the L.A. player"

Suicide, it's a suicide, yeah (x3)

C'mon yeah (x7)

[Verse Three]
Yo D., (what's up?), suckers is popping lip
Grab the H-K and the dum-dum clip and spread out
I'm putting punk's heads out
Doors is shut, there's no chance to get out
I got the motherfuckas tied with bike locks
Raise the auto-loader and let off the buckshot
{*gunfire sound*} That's how I like to do work
{*gunfire sound*} Got guts on my T-shirt
Motherfuckers tried to play the Ice
Because I rhyme smooth and on TV act nice
Soft, that's what you shouldn't have said
Now I'm so mad I'm bustin veins in my forehead
You want to get off, come on let's rock
But have your safety off, and your shit cocked
Cause when I come to get that ass
Leave your whole fuckin' block filled with hot brass
So punk, don't make me pop my trunk
Show you my amps and my Mossberg pump
Cause when I pull it, most niggas run
Fool niggas stay and get hit by the ricochet
Suicide, it's a suicide, yeah (x8)

[Verse Four]
Niggas wanna know about me and the "L", though
We squashed that shit with me and him about a year ago
But there's a new rule starting tonight
Diss me on a record, see me, FIGHT!
Cause in the days, you used to battle on mics
{*gunfire sound*} Now it's '91, I'm using gauges and flashlights
Ease back and don't give me no feedback
(Yo, Ice cool out!), yo, fuck that!
I'm hot, I'm putting niggas in cots
Some get knocked out, some just get shot
Where'd I get all the juice I use
Got a posse full of brothers with nothing to lose
Some just got out, some will never
Some beat their cases cause their lawyers were clever
I love' em all and they know that's true
So they won't blink while they doing a punk like you
Freeze motherfucker
Get on your knees, hands behind you back
Bow your heads, if you will please
I'll swing my axe, watch the bodies fall
Watch your head bounce off like volleyball
So all you motherfuckers down with the fly guy
Look me in the face, if you're strong when you walk by
And all you punk niggas talking shit
Step to the side, bow your head like a bitch
I don't play, you'll get hit by the ricochet

You'll get hit by the ricochet
You'll get hit by the ricochet

Yeah

[Ice-T]
I got a attitude as thick as a convict's
Bomb ticks, my heart beats as I rhyme over hard shit
Watch this, the nigga that you didn't think could do
Break through with the rhythm that'll rock your whole crew
Thought you knew; I ain't no punk or no pooh-butt
Step to me, the cops are still diggin niggas up
What's up? What's up? What's up? You wanna try your luck
You move, you weave, you bob, you got stuck
And now you're trippin with your fuckin brain
You never seen so much blood pour through one vein
You try to scream, you choke
You try to run, your legs are broke
You're bulletproof, I hope
Yo, I ain't no nigga to flex, but I will flip
Fuck up a nigga and dropkick his fuckin bitch
I love to squabble and I'm good widdit
So if you want some nigga come get it
I ain't trippin nigga trippin at all
Yo, I'm fuckin walkin over weak rapper's downfalls
It ain't my fault they fell, it ain't my fault I sell
I pull my ass up from the depths of hell

[Daddy Nitro]
Lawd! Jib-bibbidy-bong, jib-bibbidy-be-bong-ska-dang
Daddy Nitro an' Ice-T come wid a different some-thang
Comin out de ghetto tings are wild like pure 'ell

While other lyrics are full of our style we fill up our clientele
Ice-T an' Nitro from the, depths of 'ell, COME!

[Ice-T]
You punks are jealous cause I'm rollin in fly shit
My shit, all paid for and I don't owe no guy shit
Fuck you, it ain't my fault your ass is on empty
Thought you was it, but you're smooth gettin pimped G..
.. I ain't no ho fool
Got much respect for the new and the old school
But many rappers can rip mics but can't count..
.. zero bank amounts
Word and many critics are hot cause hard rap hits
They like to make it all soft, that weak pop shit
Fuck that, I'll die before I let the hardcore go
Cause I'm a nigga from the G-H-E-T-T-O
I got a posse who's airtight, quick to fight
And got the power to continue or end the night
And if you stepped on wrong, then you're a done kid
The yellow tape's in the club because one did
I got no pity so don't ask me for fuckin any
I'll break a bum off but you niggas can't get a penny
When I was broke, I stole my gold, I pawned
I lived the life of a hustler off and on
I'm just a brother that lived to tell
I brought my ass up from the depths of hell

[Daddy Nitro]
Come! In a de ghetto tings are wild round de clock
Some man a smoke crack and soem man a fire shot

Now watch dis, COME!

[Ice-T]
I met this girl who act like I owed her somethin
Nothin, all I owed her was some good steady fuckin
Fuck that, not the one that's gonna fall on no ho trap
Ease back bitch, before you need all your teeth back..
.. I ain't no fuckin mark
Made all my money workin bowcutters in the dark
Snatch bars and cars and vice grips
Long handled sledgehammers, saws and wire snips
I got an ill side that drips from my brain at times
It still thinks of the psycho and brutal crimes
I still remember when I had a low cash flow
No hoes, no cars, no gear no dough
And times got wicked..
.. I even remember havin to sell all my pawn tickets
But suckers spread out and they left me with few friends
But that's who wit me as we fuck up the true ends
So don't be trippin if your luck's gone bad, be glad
It'll empty out the fake fuckin friends you had
Then get yourself together, nigga aim straight
Shoot point blank at your goals, work hard and wait
You can do it even if you fell
I brought my ass back from the depths of hell

[Verse 1: Ice-T]
This is it, dope from the fly kid
The Ice mic is back with the high bid
Suckers you've lost, cause players you're not
Gangsters you ain't, you're faintin, punk, if you ever heard a gunshot
Yo, the pusher, the player, the pimp gangster, the hustler
High Roller, Dead Pres' folder
Is cold lampin' like a black king on a throne
Evil E... turn up the microphone
So I can ill and break on the rollin' tape
Another album to make? - Great
Islam turn the bass kick up a bit
Hype the snare, now I got a place to sit
And ride the track like a black mack in his 'llac
Hit the corner slow where the girls are at
And kick game the way it should be done
How you gonna drop science? You're dumb
Stupid ignorant, don't even talk to me
At school you dropped Math, Science and History
And then you get on the mic and try to act smart
Well let me tell you one thing, you got heart
To perpetrate, you're bait, so just wait
Til the press shove a mic in your face
Or you meet Boogie Down or Chuck D
Stetsasonic or the Big Daddy
And they ask you about the game you claim you got
Drop science now, why not?
You start to sweat and fret, it gets hot
How'd you get into this spot?
You played yourself

[Chorus: DJ Evil-E scratching quotes below]
Just steppin'
Yo, yo, you played yourself ---] Ice-T
Just steppin'

[Verse 2: Ice-T]
I'm no authority but I know the D-E-A-L
When it comes to dealin' with the females
What you got they want, cash is what they need
Slip sucker and they'll break you with speed
But you meet a freak, you try to turn her out
Spendin' money's what I'm talkin' about
But you fool out, your pockets got blew out
And after the date, no boots, you got threw out
Mad and shook cause your duckets got took
Call her up, phone's off the hook
But who told you to front and flaunt your grip?
You can't buy no relationship
You played yourself...

[Chorus: DJ Evil-E scratching quotes below]
Yo, homeboy, you played yourself...

[Verse 3: Ice-T]
I'm in the MC game, a lot of MC's front
And for the money they're sell out stunts
But they claim that they're rich and that they keep cash
Yo, let me straighten this out fast
Two hundred thousand records sold
And these brothers start yellin' about gold?
You better double that, then double that again
And still don't get sooped, my friend
You think you've made it, you're just a lucky man
Guess who controls your destiny, fans
But you diss them cause you think you're a star
That attitude is rude, you won't get far
Cause they'll turn on you quick, you'll drop like a brick
Unemployment's where you'll sit
No friends cause you dissed them too
No money, no crew, you're through
You played yourself

[Chorus: Ice-T w/ minor variations]
That's right, you played yourself
You played yourself
Yo, yo, you played yourself

[Verse 4: Ice-T]
You got problems, you claim you need a break
But every dollar you get you take
Straight to the Dopeman, try to get a beam up
Your idle time is spent tryin' to scheme up
Another way to get money for a jumbo
When you go to sleep, you count Five-O's
Lyin' and cheatin, everybody you're beatin'
Dirty clothes and you're skinny cause you haven't been eatin'
You ripped off all your family and your friends
Nowhere does your Larceny end
And then you get an idea for a big move
An armed robbery... - smooth
But everything went wrong, somebody got shot
You couldn't get away, the cops roll, you're popped
And now you're locked, yo, lampin' on Death Row
Society's fault? No
Nobody put the crack into the pipe
Nobody made you smoke off your life
You thought that you could do dope and still stay cool?
Fool, you played yourself

[Chorus: Ice-T w/ minor variations]
You played yourself
Ain't nobody else's fault
You played yourself

[King Tee]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, what's up Aladdin?
You think Ice-T's gonna like this mix?

[DJ Aladdin]
I think he'll like it, I think he'll like it

[Outro: King Tee]
Yo, yo, this is some hypes up
You know what I'm sayin?
Check this out
If you don't call this mix, then you want out mixed
You know what I'm sayin?
If all y'all rid out, you know what I'm sayin?
You played yourself
See y'all!

[Intro: Ice-T]
This goes out to all you ladies out there
A lot of you won't grow up to be lawyers or doctors
But you have a dream. And I think you should follow your dream

[Verse 1: Ice-T]
When you was just a little girl, you used to love nice things
Pretty party dresses, candy and rings
You was your Momma's little angel, Daddy's little girl
They used to fix your hair up in pretty ribbons and curls
Your sex drive was much deeper than the rest of the girls
You used to freak your boyfriends, take them 'round the world
As a teen, you didn't like school that much
Your moms drank, your daddy likes to cuddle and touch
Too much, so you hit the street looking for love
Affection and devotion, met none of the above
Met me in the club working your fake id
Looked me in the face like a slave set free
I said walk into my eyes baby, come with me
I can show you things that you dream to see
Take you off the street get you something to eat
Something nice to wear and a place to sleep
My name is Ice, I'm the nicest guy you're ever gonna meet
Tell me what you want, I'll make your life complete

[Hook: Ice-T (Ice's Ho)]
She said, (I always wanted to be a ho
I always wanted to be a ho)
You just had to find the player that was right for you
Now you met the Ice baby, and your dreams came true

[Verse 2: Ice-T "Ice's Ho"]
The first thing we're gonna do is buy yourself a new dress
Take some pictures, put you in the LA Express
Teach you how to walk in some high heeled shoes
Let you strut your stuff by the House of Blues
Or farther down Sunset where the tricks all cruise
"Are you my pimp?"
Oh dear God don't say that
I'm your manager, your boyfriend, you're agent, your mack
Now I'm a do my hair baby, I'll be right back
Because we gotta look good when we hits the track
Now your real name? "Shirl"
Yeah, we gotta change that
I think I'll call you Apple, cause your ass is kinda fat
How old are you? "16"
Well that's just right
But you're 18 if anybody asks tonight
I'm a teach you how to get this long paper right
Catch a trick, suck his dick, break his ass for life
Cause I love you, that's all you really need to know
I'm 'bout to miss my hair appointment, girl I got to go

[Hook: Ice-T (Ice's Ho)]
She said, (I always wanted to be a ho
I always wanted to be a ho)
You just had to find the player that was right for you
Now you met the Ice baby, and your dreams came true

[Verse 3: Ice-T "Ice's Ho"]
"Now what if I meet a trick that got long cash?"
That's when I call the crew with the black ski masks
But right now we'll only worry 'bout the basic stroll
Hooking up my Cadillac, and upping my gold
A hundred for a full hit, 50 for a hand
Throw in a blow job, they'll fuck off grands
I may even put you where the real johns at
Some call the strip club, I call the indoor track
They got lap dancers, table dancers, mad back rooms
And you can double up your profit if you take them home
"I wanna be the best"
Well this game's the test
G-string bikinis and silicone breasts
Suckas break themselves just to sniff your nest
And if you get tired, I got crystal meth
"I think I'm in love..."
Baby doll it's on
You were made for me baby, since the day you were born

[Hook: Ice-T]
You just had to find the player that was right for you
Now you met the Ice baby, and your dreams came true

[Outro: Ice-T]
Yeah baby, we gonna do a lot of beautiful things for each other
You know what I'm saying?
We gonna get me a new car
We gonna get me some better jewelry
Some nicer rags, you know what I'm saying?
We gonna help each other out, you know what I'm saying?
We gonna get me a new pad, you know?
Maybe get me a Rolex
We gonna do a lot of things for each other, it's gonna be beautiful
Me and you
I love you baby
We gonna put a whole lot of money in my pocket
That's what we gonna do. You are so cute in that dress
That's right
Damn, go on
Get your ass out there and do something right quick for a player
Yeah I love you, get your fucking ass out there
I love you, get the fuck out.. aiite..
It starts like this
Gats hit harder than fists
Just cock and lick it
The aftermath's wicked
Brass gets evicted
Another crew shot
Can't put your strap back in your waist
Cause your barrel's too hot
You did it kid
The more dead
The more weight on your head
Plus you ganked a suitcase
Full of black tar H
Baby boy, twenty keys
Dead Colombian Gs
Now you're ballin full speed
One slip you bleed
You had your nigga with you
Hard rock street gorilla hitter
He took a hot one in the shoulder
Now he's bendin over
Mad illegal
Nigga flipped harder than Buggsy Segal
He wet the room up with the rocket launchin
Desert eagle
Blood oozin through his black dickies
Ya nigga say he's getting dizzy
The car seat's fuckin getting sticky
He leaned back, his whole chest plate's cracked
You thought they hit him once
He must of got double clapped
Your niggas dyin but he ain't cryin
Soldier no doubt
He looked you dead in the eye
Said "get that money" checked out
Ballin bent him back in the black
S T S but where he's going no stress
Your niggas dead, but you're thinkin bout head
Fly hoes and condos
Once you flip the kilos
The fact your niggas out ain't shit to ya
More profit for your greedy ass
No one to split the grip wit ya
Chorus:
Common sense will keep you safer than vests
Ambulance, cots, cause real niggas give head shots
LA streets will make your guts leak
Player no doubt
Young killers live for drug wars and shoot outs

You flipped your chip
Motorola, called your hooker
Said you had a little foul up
Told the ho to wet some towels up
She didn't even talk
Clicked the phone off
Might a new some weak niggas
But this bitch ain't soft
Make your next call
Straight to your chicano connect
Said they would flip the boy for girl
Up the weight, give you Peruvian flake
You had to dump the body
Burned it beyond recognition
Back back in commission
Scooped your hooker, cleaned your seats off
Squeezed off
Two in her head
Now the fuckin bitch is dead
You're all alone just how you liked it
Straight laced hustler from hell
Street life you spiked it
It's time to hook up with the mexicanos
Layin in the Dooly parking lot of a McDonalds
Hit the corner they was there
You're prepared
Circled the block, screwed your silencer on
Rock the esse they had
Kickin back to get ya
Crept on the dropped truck
Double crossin ducks got bucked
Check the back of the cab
Suckas had the fuckin math
Ten more keys of uncut pure cash (Yes!)
Now your weighin thirty full keys
Of girl and the pony
Jumped for your lack
Hit the yack threw your head back
The big time is what you wanted
And now you got it
The devil put the strap in your palm
And you shot it
Chorus

It's going down now
On forever
Square life is never
Buck wildin is your life stylin
Mashed out
Hit a motel room
Crashed out
Called up a ho to get your dick sucked though
Bad bitch phat backs green contacts
Real hair, kept her feet all night in the air
Kind of square
Said she only worked the streets a week
Said her boyfriend kicked her out
And she needed to eat
She cuddled to you like a baby
Keep the girl mabey
The pussy was tighter than fuck drove you crazy
She kissed you on your chest and legs
Asked you to fuck her in the ass
Then she started to beg
It kind of got you open, no doubt
When baby doll fell asleep, with your dick in her mouth
Now you're layin there, lookin at the motel door
Hand on your strap, some beautiful whore
You fuckin relaxed, fell a fuckin sleep bad move
Big game take little game, show and prove
Baby jumped up, went for the strap
Dumped off
Three shots in your face
Grabbed the sutcase
Don't forget, grab the blow then jet
Before that ho hit the door she sipped a glass of Moet
Street life sabatoge
Niggas wanna live large
Demon ho out for cheddar
Capped you with your own Berreta
Chorus
Chorus:
It's 99 players check your game
Make sure them young boys respect your name
Keep your heaters at close reach cocked and ready
Cause the streets will catch you slipping, rock ya steady
Watch your back with your homies that you feel is real
Your homeboys from your crew, yeah them the ones that do you
The suckas that got the player hater venom
I wanna take 'em outside and lay some slugs up in em

[King T]
When they need work
They call the cali drug expert
Smashing in a six hundred dollar bill burnt
Looking flossy living costly
Off the edge, out of state
They gots to break bread, for sho
I needs mo' ice drops for the lexo
Briggetts sets blow when I'm sipping the mo'
Freelancing, trying to build a mansion
And stay faded
Have hoes walk around my crib butt naked...

[Ice-T]
True, pop the remy kick back and let the players represent
High floss true boss game and take aim
These sucka wannabe's
Nigga please - you're green
I'll bend hoes on the downlow - banks obscene
Wanna chill with these niggas, bet you wish you could
And suck game out my ass like sponges
I run this
You can't fuck with the steelo
You niggas wanna be low
When I'm on the east I play ceelo
Cash flow
One track mind serial hustler
Quick to break a buster ya snitch bitch?
I'll dust ya
Bentley ballin' bastard
No hustler faster
Game maker
I knock a white bitch and break her

[King T]
But Ice, Chronic got me bruising my brain
But soothing my pain, I'm true to the game
I got my mind made I gotta be that rich motherfucker
Set it up so my grandkids don't suffer
The phat hummer
The phat drummer - what's your choice?
Trying to find a sister with a voice
Make her moist
I'm throwing up the W
Bringing trouble to
Those in sight
King T and Big Ice
Chorus:

[Ice-T]
But T that's trippin' and that ain't my sport
I'd rather lamp in my crib and flip the Robb report
And set my v-dozen on the streets
Bump my beats
Cause when I'm twisting my dubs
Can't nobody compete
Imagine this:
A hundred G 'lex on your wrist
Imagine this:
About ten karrots on your fist
Imagine this:
All dime hoes on your list
Ha - that shit would be nice
But your name ain't "Ice" - kid...
I'll screw the silencer on - rock you softly
How you gonna step to me kid? You grew up off me
TV, Movies, and Records and Tours
So many busters wearing Versace I don't wear it no more...

[King T]
But this will be a classic
Many facets to get that ass kicked
The alchoholic Don, call me King Tragic
Watch me speak the magic
Watch me teach that old habit - full of havoc
And Ice'll tweak the mix when it statics
People pay
Just to have me stay
And say a verse
I'll freak a couple words unrehearsed
Then I burst
I mean I bust
From all angles
Guarunteed platium on your single

[Ice-T]
Yo T, I really must admit I'm blessed
Master V does some other shit TV's in the head rests
Never wear no vests because I got mad love
I catch respect when other niggas catch slugs
1, 2 I bust shit to load guns to
Beats for the hoodlums
Somebody's gotta do'em
Fed's screw 'em
Faggot's got my whole crib bugged
Mad tapps on the phone cause I deal with the thugs
Drugs? never
No, the Ice is too clever
I'm overseas
Checkin G's
Nigga please
Ballin' since the 70's - yeah baby
Blew up in the 80's
Now you niggas hate me
You can't see me motherfucker your focus is off
You can't be me motherfucker, you're broke and you're soft
Too many niggas try to pert my lifestyle - romancing
I was kickin game while them kids was breakdancing
Overlord - so why the wack niggas ain't dead?
Probably because my aim is over nigga's heads/
East coast - west coast, I play the whole map and bounce/
They got a benz but live in their mom's house...

Chorus

[King T]
To all my G's rock on
Get your ride on - when you hear it
The forbidden Gangland lyric
Player Haters fear it
Get you right up close near it
Possessed by the Eazy-E spirit
Ice-T set the limit
And niggas won't cross this line
Suicide - and niggas won't cross this nine
In your mouth
Puffin' with my niggas down south
What the fuck this really all about? man..
I'm coming out
Front and back, 98 brougham
All you fake G's stay home
Leave that shit alone
King Tee's back on the throne
And that nigga on the mic - straight gone
Cra-zy, y'all niggas wanna know the real deal?
I'll freestyle and smack you in your grill
Bomb lyrics, no special effects or gimmicks
The Syndicate will put you in the mix - biatch...

[Intro: Too $hort/Ice-T]
TS: Yeah, man, we just sitting back, chilling
Bunch of players listening to the seventh deadly sin
Short dawg is doing his thing with my nigga Ice-T
Don't fake the funk

I: Ice-T baby, this goes out to all you haters out there
Actin' like a brother done did somethin' wrong
Cause he got his game tight
Don't hate the player, hate the game

[Hook: Ice-T]
Don't hate the player, hate the game
Niggas, sharpen your aim
Every baller on the streets is searching fortune and fame
Some come up, some get done up, except the twist
If you out for mega cheddar, you got to go high risk

[Verse 1: Ice-T]
Sometimes I get illy, cock back the nine-milli
I choose not to bust, smack your punk-ass silly
Just bought a crib, it cost two-point-five milli
Swimming pool in my livin' room, I guess I'mma willy
I don't get high, so I don't split the phillies
Niggas say they gonna kill me and I say: "Oh really?"
Hit my Kawazakie I pull off on a willy
This is straight-lace pimpin', I know you hoes feel me
I come through - make your whole club petrol
You might as well let go, I blast, make the whole cub echo
You don't really wannna test an L.A. vet though
Most of my crews' on Death Row - the real
Quick with the trigger, nice with the steel
Step into the kill zone caps get peeled
You whack, you looking for a record deal
Bow down, on second thought punk bitch kneel

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Ice-T]
Don't hate, cause my game's much tighter than yours
My girls, finer than yours, my jewels shine, brighter than yours
You look me dead in my face
Then you act like you don't see me
You wanna be me, you hate my motherfucking guts
Licking nuts - what's the deal? It's a level playing field
My game's against yours, hustling wars
Roll the dice, risk your motherfucking life
Bank rolls and low hoes, anything goes
Ridin' rolls in a week, clap a nigga who speaks
I'm suceedin', in tryin' to keep from bleedin' in the lane
Crystal Meth, F.C.C., and crack, cocaine
Got a nigga tryin' to figure out the best route
I got cops in my rear view, too, but I'll shoot
Every bitch I meet is fucking up to something
Take a nigga to the crib lay him down and start dumping
Gat pumping, they'll kill your ass for a G
Hate the game, motherfucker, don't hate me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ice-T]
Yo, my name will sell better than rap like the Acropolis
Suckers might as well step back, there ain't no stoppin' this
Whack magazines who tried and tried to toppen this
I still got more Lexus and gators on my shopping list
Make a fist, take your best shot, bet you drop it kid
Hit more licks than you, and never caught a bid
Make the whole world go crazy, they said about the pig
Bald-headed hoes step back; bitch, go and cop a wig
When I do a show, best believe it drop
Every night I got my straps, best believe they cocked
Some bitch talks crazy, then that bitch gets socked
If a man steps up, then he too gets dropped
Fuck the cops, I'm still folding fat knots
Catch me on the weekend, floating my yacht
Say, "Ice, kick some game," and I'll teach you a lot
Knock your bitch no matter how hard your block

[Hook x2]

[Outro: Ice-T]
I don't know why a player wanna hate T
I didn't choose the game, the game chose me

Niggas crazy and shit (Word, yeah fuck them body-o's homes)
Motherfuckers is faggots (call me nigga?)

(Ice-T)
Step back it's the ultimate nigga with the hot shit
The last standin' man, smack you with my backhand
The veteran-er-the games you claim to be in
Let me begin, express it, explain the dilemma

(Chorus: Ice-T)
It's either them or us, niggas that bust
Niggas who ride, niggas that'll kill for this side
Down to get down with the three-o-to-four pound
Hit a nigga dead in his wig - FUCK IT!!
(Ice-T)
It's the National Pass Time, it's blast time - club's out
Niggas break ill, pop-drunks get the guns out
Set the shit off with the full clips
Niggas lookin' hard in the club - now whassup bitch?
Whassup bitch?!! Pull your weapon if you got it
I'da shot it, plus you never live with rockets
Tried to dodge it, caught you all in the arm pit
Easy target, dug you out in the lot kid

(Chorus: Ice-T)
It's either them or us, niggas that bust
Niggas that ride, niggas that'll kill for this side
Down to get down with the three-o-to-four pound
Hit a nigga dead in his wig - FUCK IT!!

(El Sadiq)
Yo, too many bitch-ass-niggas think they got a lot
And I'mma dead these wannabe heads with consecutive shots
Man, they smile up in you, griller wanna give you a pen
Stick it to your crew like glue like they been down
Man listen, kill that bull with the fake-ass handshakes
You can slide by me with the rest of them damn snakes
Flakin' like paper while I'm takin' my life serious
You talkin' and playin', your whole antenna's mystevious
Claimin' that you got juice with an ultimate ???
But when the brother test you, murder and recieved no types of love
You think you got game, with that favour to your brain?
FUCK YA NAME!!! Stompin' the rut got yourself to blame
I represent Castor - bring it to you live
But cool and civilized, despise a nigga's livin' lies
No alibi's I see the weakness in your eyes dun
You wanna run? Plus ya scared to shoot a gun for fun
You bust a couple of slugs off the rooftop
My team, come and touch ya somethin', make ya crew drop
My nigga ICE, twice as nice
El Sadiq free shit but platinum mics
Chorus: Ice-T)
It's either them or us, niggas that bust
Niggas that ride, niggas that'll kill for this side
Down to get down with the three-o-to-four pound
Hit a nigga dead in his wig - FUCK IT!!
It's either them or us, niggas that bust
Niggas that ride, niggas that'll kill for this side
Down to get down with the three-o-to-four pound
Hit a nigga dead in his wig - FUCK IT!!

You wanna get live? Start scaubblin' with the bald-heads
Callin' them family, told 'em nothin' but the feds
That's the blue and red who be dead
When the sunrise come six in the mornin'?
I'm maxin' like a wiseguy
Know the John Gotti but I'm fuckin' up the body
Everytime my poet thug at a party
Ya wanna step to T, go through JEL first
But remember where you see your homicide show rehearsed
Check 'em tag-times like they do with a pencil
No more solitary cause we mashin' in a Benzo
Next who gettin' hitters talkin' shit cause we bit 'em
Seven Deadly Sinner, problem-atic-rhyme-spitter
You a quitter - but I'mma bomb steady
If I was out of slugs, look out for Machette
From ear to ear homes, it's clear, you'll be bleedin'
Not me motherfucker lifestyles I've been devin'
Chorus: Ice-T)
It's either them or us, niggas that bust

Ride as my jabos, cocked my straps watcha back
You know where you at? You in urban combat
So stay alert, use the attack of the tactical expert
Puttin in work, and leavin your troops with wet shirts
Your casuality rate is high, I'm closin in
Prepare for your ultimate end, tell your family bye
Better cool like Egon, and shine like veegon
Pissin on your beons, for decades and eons
You squad has no muscle plus you, my new hustle
Fuck scuffin up my knuckles, rather buck you and watch you buckle
I can't stand a snitch, a switch real bitch
I got some transcripts to say you been runnin ya lips
Now its on, on site, if I see you I'mma sin ya
If I catch you in traffic I'mma gift ya somethin in ya
Letcha battle with death for the prize of life
I learned ta never come empty handed to a gun fight
My advesaries feel fright, his last sight
Was a flash of light, you said lightning could strike
From the same place twice, I have your head on my death
1500, tonights your last night gettin blunted
"The voices could not be stopped, it began to morph
And reinvent themself, I grew like a black blade
Moving like a tornado from the west to the east coast
Leaving behind a path of destruction and mayhem"

(Laquan)
Thick's ice fix ghosts infrared no remorse
And low from the exchange, psycho derranged
Playa lay no feel pain, killa cocka-main
I'm top framin the game, use muscle for the hustle
I zip duffle bags to muffle fags
Scuffle my knuckles bad on niggas that think that they runnin shit
They feel the punishment, uh, blood bath, the wrath
Aftermath, at least the guns in shit
Too under fallin charum leads to send up on the earth
Mix things with daughters with men
Since poured from birth the worth for the others
Go to war with my brothers
I'm unstable like Kane did to Abel
I'm out the stable sinnin from the beginnin
Leavin daddy's little girl pretty linen bloody red
What's said in the book of dead is now all forgotten
My soul's rotten, still the blood's spilled I feel
Chills, I'm still plottin, I'm ill-norm
Take life forms like light storms I laugh at the wrath
Of the guys comin on, visions of the antichrist is risen
The question is now, am I unforgiven?
"Legends tells that the creator of this poison's name was Ice
Although, others have told different stories, no matter
Who or what invented the monster, their souls would be forever
Damned to Hell"

(Ice T)
Enter the death chambre, cash richer, leave ya nutless
Cutless with the raw scope, double ya dope
Feel my back lash, body cash your whole fam and media
Greedy shit, tag ya out the rag Jag, speedy shit
Look in the sky, the four horsemen bustin no discussion
No stoppin its apocalypse, lock and load ya clips
Gonna be rich and dead, copa said don't matter cats scatter
Suckas get touched, niggas get rushed
Watch em transform into animal form, wicked Hell-born
Lord of the Flies, cry and ya die
Mechanama come masses soul snatcher, fallen angel
All angles covered for you fuckin God lovers
Possession, good suggestion run cuddle your funds
Double your guns, watch your kids grow, stay out my flow
Be wise, the magnificence, evidence, decadence mind
Seven sins, the abomination, I'm
That nigga, last nigga, street mack
Hot is my strap, wet is your back
Understand I never forgive, leavin bodies like seive
Clap gats til my fuckin shit's clipless
Niggas bear witness
"Like any deadly disease, it has infected many men
From the east, west, north, and south, gangsta rap is now
Alive, God forgive me, God forgive me"
(Intro: Ice-T)
Yeah, Ice-T nigga, Seventh Deadly Sin
It's all about that hardcore mind
Got my nigga Radzay, my nigga Bazaro, my girl Gripsta in the house
We gonna do it for all the hardcore niggas out there like this...

(Radzay)
A hard hit makes a soft ass, that's what they told me huh!
I'm totally gone, I'm in another zone nigga put me on this
We layin' stick, my lyrics is heat
Havin' visions of ritual mirrors inside my sleep - nigga peep
I remember watchin' the news, dead people in jimmy bag
I got a Nine nigga get me mad
And watch me throw up razorblades and get to trippin'
I'm cats and crippin', lickin' is civil like Jack the Ripper
I'm on a mission drippin'-a-fog
An when it sees a million motherfuckers deceased
Some of police are brutal hog, I'm actor-baitin'
No hesitation to slice a motherfucker in thirty places
Fuck a case - ain't leavin' traces here to Redder-Dip
I'm aimin' a - automatic find a bitch I'm hangin' up
Protainin' up, boss strangler, better save my mother
Flat packs will end as brothers - the bloody covers
Bloody gloves like Yo-J, AK's my brainwaves
I'll strung a nigga all day to my dear play you won't be comin' back
I put that on my dear pops when I blast a fierce drop
My bloody mask revealin' Jason it's non-stop
The cemetary is what you facin'
My steel shot is smokin' like chainsaws, brains call
Recommend that you get your homies and watch your motherfuckin' game fall
(Chorus)
I only like my shit hardcore
(Radzay, South Central L.A. nigga)
I only like my shit hardcore
I only like my shit hardcore
I only like my shit hardcore

(Ice-T)
Prepare for the night that you never wanted
These streets is taunted, blacked out impala with the big rims on it
Hit'cha corner with the lights out, bitch it's on
Duck down wit'cha kids, you know what you did
Motherfuck what your niggas say, watch for the ricochet
It's gonna be hard to hear much, once my trigger spray
That's neither here nor there, just beware
Cause when I bust off my gat flings like a roll flair
You now listenin' to - the most hated and most loved at the same time cuz
Ice nigga what the fuck you wanna do about a T
Most'cha bitch niggas can't fuck with me
Cause your chin-chalked talk I can see through
Like you're rollin' in a phat V-12
Bulllshit - pull quick and have your shit cocked or dropped
Keep a spare clip cause sometimes the shots don't stop
It's motherfuckin' game to rap about, shits' for real
Double action, ain't gotta cock back no more
Got you bitch-ass niggas sweatin' like Taibo
Rather lookin', in my face, I'm just checkin' my flow
So, I advise you to keep it in the studio
Your attittude, you don't wanna meet me dude
My crews' like a fuckin' wild bunch of escaped beasts
Like scientists, cross cells of apes and G's
All the war - get you battle gear, black fatigues
You talk shit, your crews' catch a casualty, uh!
(Chorus)
I only like my shit hardcore
(Ice-T nigga, what?)
I only like my shit hardcore
I only like my shit hardcore
I only like my shit hardcore

(Bazaro)
Aiyyo my style be official, I bust like a pistol
Criminal - the issue, mad shit the nigga been through
Peep now, system, handcuffs nigga listen
Word up, robbin' white boys to buy blunts
The representative - GorTek Assassin thought to be a stallion
Yo I be splashin' Street Wars
The hardcore Ambassador in a black four door Akaror, I attach yours
The Marquise piece, gold teeth and medallion
Heads I be sappin' like the grams I be baggin'
Fightin' women, cut throat and tree smokin'
Violatin', infiltratin', blunt bakin'
Block regulatin', the cake, bake, a brick flippin'
Green expedition thicker to body stickin'
Bazaro, yo I got the hardcore flow
I drop to put a rock from the Bronx y'all know

(Chorus)
I only like my shit hardcore
(Bazaro, Boogie down Bronx baby)
I only like my shit hardcore
(Grip)
On the mic, Grip be flexin'
Who's next to wreck when I mic check, mic check
I'm checkin' any verbal an' steppin'
What the fuck nigga duck you ain't fuckin' with this
Get touched cause I lust to bust when I clutch
With the quickness, killin' lyricist when I spit this
Who's next on my hitlist when I rip this
Lyrically I'm material, the Rap War General
Droppin' hoes quicker than a syllable, yeah you killable
Your style, unfillable, wishin' my shit was stillable
I eel for the fuck of it, queen you know I'm lovin' it
Dick, never suckin' it unless I see a buck in it
You need the whip, cluck it kid, I'm furious
Leavin' your crew delirious so you don't take it serious
I'm guessin' you was serious about the West, none test
I got the rep for my niggas on the shaw
Got the ball, fuck the law and yep I wet 'em out
As I proceed to spread 'em out and dead 'em out
Spray 'em out, lay 'em out
Ain't no surprise, come see me with four eyes
Young Grip I'm a prize, prepare for you demise
Recognize I put a hole in the local aforenor
Nigga this is Coroner

(Ice-T)
Gripsta, Oakland, California

I only like my shit hardcore...
(Intro: KAM)
Aiyyo this is Kam representin' Watts in Compton

(Buckshot Shorty)
Anything can happen
Don't stop, huh, ha, huh, uh, yeah, shit
(Buckshot, Ice-T)
Buckshot, he be the emcee
What, watch your step

(Buckshot Shorty)
Can I hear it for Buckshot? (Buckshot)
Buck's hot, spell it and yell it but the shit don't stop
It be hot, y'all niggas is worthless in the money market
I'm buck you ain't worth shit, nigga what?
Think about it, shorty what you drivin' stoned by your daddy
Oops, you almost had me, geesed up until I saw the truth
And one day I see you standin' at a token booth
It was on a hot wet night, I think it was a Saturday
Right after that party that he lead out down the way
Gunshots spread - everyday, all day (fuck!)
D.T.'s rushed the party in 2K
Buck - The Beef be - fled the scene right before the cops
And the Swats came with the triple beam
Uh, shit is real you know how we do when the young niggas peel out
Don't squeal (*undecipherable*)
(Ice-T)
If you niggas don't know you should know by now
Ice got more game than the law allows
Straight up - the biggest baller in the industry
Went straight from pimpin' hoes on the NBC
Do you feel me? I dealed it, ace off the bottom
Ho's got 'em, I'm the one you just can't fade
Rolex in the tenth grade, hair was laid
Everything I wore to school baby was tailor made
Shot dice in the bathroom on my knees
I'll roll across the break and break that ass with these
Start hittin' jewel-liks, re-investin' in ki's
Drop the top on the flo', let you feel the breeze

(Buckshot Shorty)
Trees make my eyes bleed I come from an ill breed
Thoroughbred born from a strong seed
Led by a bunch of individuals (Ali)
Uh, criminals to generals - this is like wow!
Look at how my brain ay blew you out the frames
Twist of fate cause you say the same shit now
The Local Mobb Grill and let y'all niggas know I'm dead
I'm serious, somebody can get killed
Wait for the fire drill and when you start to smell the smoke
Run nigga Buck ain't no joke I'll buck a shot at your zipped up coat
Chop the throat like a blow from Judo, nigga you know
(Ice-T)
Is it new year God? I'm comin' back mad-hard
Movin' harder than a convict with a shack in the yard
New Jacks wanna hear me rap beggin' for freestyle skills
I've served so many rappers I can make a land field fool
You've doubt for a mic dude, the Ice is a jewel
Fuck rules , I got more pool than a mule
Matter of fact, never comprehend the styles I sin
I've been breakin', annihilate fakes and tens
See I'm a nigga from the West Side cheered I peel libs
What prayin' that you do hill when I all ready did
Like your girl gotta admit she was a sexy bitch
But I hit it with the Gin so my nuts don't itch
(Whta, what, what?)

(Buckshot Shorty)
Buck's got ya locked, body drawn like pit bulls
We don't give a fuck if we have to pull, click, shit
Brooklyn niggas is known to rep-resent
Any nigga happened that's why I left
Niggas get strep-throats, throats get strepped
Get your shit taken then your shit is kept
Uh, shit in a step, if not got your back broke
Plus ya jaw tapped, snapped your 'Adams Ap'
It's just a fact that niggas ain't shit
Ain't shit like Egyptians, nigga trippin'
Beenie-eyed, never slippin', I'm grippin' the four-twenty
Motherfuck the bullshit talk - where the money?
Years ago, a friend of me ask me to start up a company
Duck Down's the name, rap music is the aim
Lyrically I bring the pain and lock the game with no padlock and chain
Some said that Buck went bust
But when I came out, I left 'em all in the dust
Look at your sound scam, original brown man
Makin' million everytime I drop a jam
(Ice-T)
Nigga duck, DJ drop the cut, huh
250 niggas throw they sets up
L.A. style, nigga what? (West Side!!)
If you've never seen it before they'll put a knot in your gut
Stand up, check your areas your group, your troops
These gang killers is real plus they, off the loot
Proceedin' to leave a nigga bleedin'
They love to fuck up in a frenzy, let fuckin' sharks feed me
Bitches start screamin' and stampedin'
Thank God it's evening, I didn't leave the burner in the B.M
Where my nigga Buck, nobody seen him
Probably in the Eye Of The Storm where the ill perform, perform, perform...
(Erick Sermon)
Yo whassup, this the E-Double

Rims so fat, looks will digitise it all
Get your moneyman lock your blocks, cock your Glocks
Really doe - bust until your barrels glow (*gunshot*)

(Ice-T)
Nigga tryin', then got tied up buttnaked
Fuckin' with the master of this, jacker of this
Squeezin' off until I fuckin' sprain my wrist
Slap the clip into Armageddon and start wettin'
Grit my teeth, bring it like the Persian Gulf
Airstrike you, burn you with the mic to might you
Thinkin' about takin' me out - huh you're funny
More guns and more money, think about it
You're dead I'm livin
You're fuckin' with the unforgiven - nigga what?
West Side's up - L.A., nigga bounce all day
Look in my eyes, what you see ain't no bitch or pimp
Nigga from the Central and I'm gonna stay rich
Nightmares of bein' broke keep me flowin' like this
Weak niggas - you're sure to get lost in the bliss
This is for the niggas, quick to slaughter
Resumes held by the D.A.'s, the ballers
(Chorus: Ice-T)
Rock your hammers back cussers that's the way that we ball
Rims so fat, looks will digitise it all
Get your moneyman lock your blocks, cock your Glocks
Really doe - bust until your barrels glow (*gunshot*)
Rock your hammers back cussers that's the way that we ball
Rims so fat, looks will digitise it all
Get your moneyman lock your blocks, cock your Glocks
Really doe - bust until your barrels glow (*gunshot*)

(Ice-T)
To all my niggas on the East and West that rock vests
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get your moneyman
To all the killers that's real, quick to flex the steel
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get your moneyman
To my hard-hustlin' girls all around the world for ice
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get your moneyman
It's ninety-eight, it's never too late playa
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get your moneyman

(Ice-T)
Many casualties caught in the cross-fire mix
While whole crews flash they fo-fo's in the flicks
Magazine after magazine gets stomped in the street
Late night, auto, maga-static
Hit the next turn, hang 'em out and cause havoc
Your cash, your block, I gotta have it
Nigga normally toss it up and live lavish
My traps well lured, I go hardboard
It gets loud, known for bustin' off in crowds
Word 'em up, hurt 'em up, move out, blow the spot
Round two, rounds flew (*shots*) in the parkin' lot
Niggas rallied up to see who got shot
Wait down G, my whole crew surrounds me
We outty, niggas known to sit the stompede and get rowdy
L.A. - niggas know my flow
They see me on the shore, when I'm rippin' my rows
(Chorus: Ice-T)
Rock your hammers back cussers that's the way that we ball
Rims so fat, looks will digitise it all
Get your moneyman lock your blocks, cock your Glocks
Really doe - bust until your barrels glow (*gunshot*)
Rock your hammers back cussers that's the way that we ball
Rims so fat, looks will digitise it all
Get your moneyman lock your blocks, cock your Glocks
Really doe - bust off until your barrels glow (*gunshot*)

To all my niggas on the East and West that rock vests
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get your moneyman

(Intro: Ice-T)
Every year the same shit happens
More fuckin' funerals, dead homies
Niggas out here killin' each other
I don't know why
And when it happens to you
Just can't turn the other fuckin' cheek
Gotta get back for your dead niggas
Yeah I'm caught up to

(Ice-T)
Sometimes I sit and wonder
How many motherfuckers gonna die this summer
Gunshots from the hummer
Now the sawed-off riot pumps lead across your beds
They said: "Mama, less you wouldn't strike back"
Mack ten, eleven, twelve, hit us and then puts us to hell
They started it, there's no way to mend it, we'll end it
My crew'll hit the matresses, G.O.D
Father style - all prepared to get buckwild
Half my niggas ball, other half ain't got it all
They stay up at nights waitin' on a combat call
Drinkin' hard liquor, smokin' mad loop and shit
So high, sometimes I even gotta load they clips
I ain't mad at them though, they dumps the ammo
In you, suspend you in the air, hell yeah
It's the time that the real niggas live for retaliation
Move on 'em, show, improve on 'em
All you punk bitches just stand back and watch
Me, I'm oilin' up the Heckler & Koch
I gots no love, for them busters, who put the work in
I can still see my fuckin' boys' body jerkin'
I ran over to him, put my hand on his chest
Hole like an apple in the side of his neck
His eyes glanced up, his body jerked once more
There's nothin' else to do but to go to war
Slide the hollow-tips in the chrome four-four
Roll down the windows, hang the heat out the door
Catch all the fuckin' bodies that I can tonight
Double-back on your bitch crew, broad daylight
(Chorus: Ice-T)
There's no innocence allowed in these ghetto streets
Grab your guns, buck 'em off, when ya hit ya leak
Tell me what would you do if they killed your best friend?
Could you keep your cool, would the wounds mend?
If I said "peace", I'll be a motherfuckin' liar
("I'm lettin' off until my arms tired" - cut and scratched*)Retaliation

(Ice-T)
Been packin' straps so long
I gots some permanent bruise in my leg
Better that than dead
Now it's time to show you what I'm trained for in this
Rally up the wolfpack-attack relentless
Make ya understand it was the wrong crew ya fuck with
Now it's on bitches, guys are darker than shit
You musta not a known who you fuckin' hit that day
Or maybe you did, you're dyin' anyway
And not just you, some of your family
To tell you the truth any fuckin' body we see
You might just wanna turn yourself into me
To save your hood pain of my crews' treachery
You fucked up, we know who you are, where ya live
We got your place ran up to a cop on the take
We'll hit your block so hard, you'll swear it was an earthquake
Squeeze off the fully-auto, make your whole crib shake
I know you're breathin' hard, livin' on your last day
Or maybe, you're laughin', thinkin' that you got away
I don't give a fuck, I won't sleep
Till one of us lays me and my nigga
That's the fear of these triggers
If ya smart, ya probably make a break out of state
We'll just snatch your kid, grab your fuckin' bitch and wait
I'll catch ya down South, lay your ass out straight
There's no where to run, it's time to meet your make
You got one chance, arm your whole damn crew
I couldn't stop my fuckin' niggas if I wanted to
(Chorus: Ice-T)
There's no innocence allowed in these ghetto streets
Grab your guns, buck 'em off, when ya hit your leak
Tell me what would you do if they killed your best friend?
Could you keep your cool, would the wounds mend?
If I said "peace", I'll be a motherfuckin' liar
("I'm lettin' off until my arms tired" - *cut and scratched*)
Retaliation

("Lettin' off until my arms tired" - *cut and scratched*)

[Intro]
Yo Ice - We heard what happened man
We heard some niggas ran in on you man
Yeah yeah, shit was fucked up man, it was real fucked up
Don't worry - We know who did it
What're you talkin about man?
The shit just happened about 3 hours ago
Yeah - but we know who did it man... it was your boy
What? Naugh man I'm not trying to hear that
Yo listen man, it was your boy man - He talks a lot
I can't believe this shit man, I grew up with this nigga man
This motherfucker, I would've died for this nigga man
And this nigga set me up?

You're now fucking with your last nigga
Quick to blast nigga
Gauge Masturbator
Chest Plate disintegrator, rider
I never wore no mask, wacked the witness - vestless
I'll put you on the graveyard's guest list
ICE - cause I lack all emotions, I'm heartless
That's why I can't figure for the life of me
You'd want to start this
My crew is bottomless
Street Lobotomists
Gun slingers
Glock cocked and diamond ringers
Hustlers
My nigga got shot but still alive
He took a full clip from another player's 25
And he said he's rolling with me, if you're coming
I told him, stay home, rest up, I got enough gunning
Homiciders
Ballin' rag Rolls riders
Blood letters
Money getters
Life betters
The last thing I heard you say you said I was a dead man, bitch
I'll put you right into gun point, you snitch
Now I know your plans are rolling on me, late when I sleep
Why don't we do this man to man? Let them bitch niggas creep
I still remember in the days when we was friends chillin
Now it seems you going to have to be my next killin
Chorus x2:
You wanna go to war, nigga tell me why?
Punk niggas talk shit, bitch niggas die
I never backed down and it ain't no time to start
Let's take it to the streets and I'm a check your heart

You must be death wishing, what's up? You know my steelo
Got love with the illest of blacks and amigos
Your jealousy is outta hand, I can't fuck wit'cha
And all your so-called down niggas, say good luck to ya
They know you're off the hook and you're soon to bleed
My reputation states that I kills with speed
More drama than a rap verse
You'll feel the mack first
In your back first
Then the black hearse
Goddamn, I can't understand the drama why?
To tell the fucking truth I thought your crew was fly
Now you're talking that shit like a bitch on the rag
Don't give a fuck about your set or the pants you sag
I drop a hot one in your forehead, neck and mouth
Then rush a hospital and bank ya if you don't check out
Cause I'm a mad nigga once, a crazy nigga twice
A cold blooded motherfucker, that's why they call me ICE
And if you told me this would happen
I would said never - no, we down forever - we flipped keys together
Now the street talkers say you want my spot
A lotta niggas did, A lotta niggas shot
Chorus

It's obvious some sucka niggas got ya gassed
Let's see if they around you when the gunshots blast
It ain't nothing nice, letting off slugs under the street life
Early deaths, dry gags and last breaths
I seen your time before you want - war till it's on
How to fuck with the king, when you're a bullshit pawn?
I can't comprehend your stupidity, miscalculation
Word to obstetricians show your crews anhiliation
Predicted, Brains get evicted, Fuckin with me kid
Bullets lift your lid
And watch your weak kool aid heart run down the drain
I got the Method Man who came to bring the pain
Let you know quick, niggas suck dick if you trip
Used to be my homie, now you just a punk ho bitch
Frustration leads to aggravation and dismay
Now you're player haten, but that's the wrong game to play
I light your block up, kidnap your moms - snatch your woman
You beg for me to stop, but I'll just keep coming
You're fucking with the illest fool in Southern California
I can roll with ya, or motherfuckin' on ya

Chorus x2

Yeah, I know the real nigga can feel this
This is dedicated to all my "friends"
(Threat)
What they screamin' when they shout?
Who they fiendin' fo' - Zoo rock the house fo' sure
We boom you need some elbow room, that's right
Cause I be chokin' the mic, place me under arrest
I'm on the hit list baby cause I'm one of the best
We on a quest all across the coast to get fresh, yeah, yeah
Nigga fly like the air, been up in the game and you can keep the change
Tried to smash all the beef, turn the leaf over
Cheap Rock-Rolla, can't be seen, bring your football team
Bump your Queen plus we want the chips
Spank the white man on his ass with the whip
The world is fillin' us, killin' us softly, Adolf Khadafi
Still real gangsters don't tell what they do, they just do what they got to
AAAAAAWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOO!!

(Sondoobiest)
Mic smugglers, hustlers, hold your jugglers
Forty guzzlers, muscular, Son'll fuck wit'cha
One of ya, actin' funnier, think you're hungrier
Some of y'all know, the streets stay ghetto govenor
Swash Buckler, Club King, pull the gun to her
For the love of her, punish 'em, drop they juggler
Son's guns stompin' dirt, hurts come at runnier
Son's luckier, put your money up and stumbler
Raise her birthday, cut yo' - Son Gun-the-Gun
Comes from vomit coke, drunk number runs
Club tumblers who thug wit' us - double up
Mother-luggers shots blast, Ice what the fuck?!!
(Intro: Ice-T)
This song is dedicated to my man 2Pac Shakur, rest in peace!!
Notorious B.I.G., rest in peace!!
And all my other homies that have died
In the madness called street life
Rest in peace!!

(Chorus)
I'mma straight up G, let's not pretend
Dedicated to, all of my friends
On the East and the West Coast
Gotta let this drama go

(Ice-T)
Nineteen eighty six, deep in the mix
Me and my team out for cream and jewel-liks
The faster, the better, blood, leather, the baby sledge
Case hitters - me, I'm the point man
Give less than a damn about anything, just let my hammer swing
Come up, give me my cut - what?
Girls don't mean nothin' to me, don't push the button on me
Out for the twist, ya nastically nasty G
Basically makin' me anti-social individual, too hype
Recognize the type?
Then a music called hip-hop came along and saved my life
I had a story to tell about my knowledge of hell
$2.50 for a book, listen and look, now let's do some Math
A gun and a hand, plus an angry man, minus love
Equals and me, the sky's blue and they rags
Toe-tags and body bags - y'all feel me?
Is it too real G? Brothers say drop some heat T
Absoultely, everything's goochie since we realized
This games' the only one we got left
Hip-hop's become the game of death
Some of y'all busters out there tryin' to waste up
It would've took some of us hustlers all this time to lace up
(Chorus)
I'mma straight up G, let's not pretend
Dedicated to, all of my friends
On the East and the West Coast
Gotta let this drama go

(Ice-T)
Ok, let me break it down, they got the one strike law
You go in, you reach the other two before you know
What happen to you - game's over dude
On the next page, they got power in effect
While you two rednecks waitin' to see which one of us
Kills the next brother next
Think about it too long'll make you sick
Believe me the last thing they wanna see is us risin'
Economically, astronomically it could happen homie - follow me
Hip-hop's the black goal - mind and soul
Refined as we roll, another ghetto story is told
I stopped flippin' ki's in eighty three
They need a time machine to carcerate me
I'm square as a pool table, twice as green, know what I mean?
Flippin' from heat, the legal green, the hip-hop scene
Beef, the only beef I got is the steak
I'm tryin' to eat from the players elite
East, West, North, South, Moon, Star
I'm gonna ball wherever the chips are
I hope y'all players listen, ain't out there hatin' and dissin'
Y'all know the game is to be sold and not told
I should be takin' a collection, this time I'll make an exception
I've just been here for the start of this
I gotta come from the heart for this
(Chorus)
I'mma straight up G, let's not pretend
Dedicated to, all of my friends
On the East and the West Coast
Gotta let this drama go

(Ice-T)
Some nights I lay awake tryin' to analyse
And anticipate the moves of the fakes
Wonder if the cancers' in too deep - can't sleep
Tryin' to diagnose the poison that's increased
Injected into a pure hustle born on city streak
Migranes fill my brain as I reach toward the realm of the insane
Wishin' and prayin' that another brother gets
To live the life that I got to play in
Tryin' to represent to the fullest
I gotta come hard y'all, no time to pull it
Y'all fools think illin' and tearin' up
Hip-hop is the thing to do G?
I'm paid I don't need rap no more fool I make a movie
Y'all tryin' to lose me
And to y'all suckers with your afrobatic, player hatin' tatics
Tryin' to jump over the bree and plannin' and hustlin'
I've been corporatin' to this music over these years
Y'all will fall victim to your own lies and the P.I
Will continue to rise, over your eyes kid
This games' immaculate, dramas' irrelevant - stay sucker reppellin'
Invent, incoporate, parlay, play
And I got no reason to lie to you
(Chorus)
I'mma straight up G, let's not pretend
Dedicated to, all of my friends
On the East and the West Coast
Gotta let this drama go
I'mma straight up G, let's not pretend
Dedicated to, all of my friends
On the East and the West Coast
Gotta let this drama go

(Ant Banks)
This is Ant Banks, and it's hella motherfuckin' deadly sins
But don't ever fuck with the seventh bitch

(Intro: Ras Kass)
Yeah, seventh, uh-huh, first things first man you're messin' with the worst
One, come on, come on, one

(Chorus: Marc Live)
Yo, yo, yo motherfuckers can't fuck with this, realness
Seventh sin deadly, raise the key to rock steady
Run son the hour has come, touch ya
Remember this, real niggas don't rhyme
We walk up and buck ya
Stuck ya in the head, rush ya
Trife niggas knife you, seven venoms fight you
Your life's through, fuckin' with the wrong click - kapow!!
From the crackhouse, niggas quick to blow your back out

(Marc Live)
Enough talk, niggas talk too much, let's set it
Time to splash bitch niggas, gun fights, paramedics
Call my regiment up at midnight, tape on a flash light
Youn claim you want beef, it's too tough, called your bluff
Shot you at such close range, blew out your eardrum
Caught you with my mack, blast your cage our your back
Yo, the nigga stepped up and got bucked by my ninja's
Casualty after casualty all up in ya
Ya not a street vet yet bitch, just a beginner
My niggas eat punk like your crew for dinner
Rock ya in broad daylight to make the wrist-double
Hit ya then lower my gun and watch ya chest bubble
Step up, feel the Teflon, black talent
Rip through your vest, hit your chest, lose your balance
You never had no drama with the real, now ya want it?
My skill got you haunted, my ski-mask got ???
(Marc Live)
Aiyyo blackout, my whole click we blastout
The wrong move, show improve you assed out
Venom it, warn the niggas, treacherous
Squeeze automatic, quick to bust fuck with us
Yo the worst niggas, work the bitch to double figures
In new sixes, hennessey with dark mixes
The richest, fuck around, you won't fix it
Toke, heavy metal, settle shit, rebel shit
Fuck a cop, why not, we last niggas on your block
Last standin', coked up, we fucked up
Twenty g's, rope 'em up, you in the trunk - Lex Coupe
I'll leave a nigga with cement boots
Now we off lootin', hold me down, yo I'll start shootin'
In ya double lefts and tell the rest an'
Marc Li-ive, fuck the pad, bust his ass
And slide my fuckin' heat in the stash

(Chorus: Marc Live)
Yo, yo, yo motherfuckers can't fuck with this, realness
Seventh sin deadly, raise the key to rock steady
Run son the hour has come, touch ya
Remember this, real niggas don't rhyme
We walk up and buck ya
Stuck ya in the head, rush ya
Trife niggas knife you, seven venoms fight you
Your life's through, fuckin' with the wrong click - kapow!!
From the crackhouse, niggas quick to blow your back out
(Ras Kass)
She musta kicked off like special teams
I walk rare from a muchy bled nigga all lookin' like Grenedine
Murder scene, three to the head, three to the sline
We tied that motherfuckin' number like Kareem
It seems that I used to wonder why niggas don't give a fuck
Within 2G - niggas is just buck
From hip-hoppers to gangsta's, sportin' stompers at yompers
The mirror has two faces in this room is not proper
So we religiously pray for peace and pack one
I walk softly, carry a big dick
These family jewels is my most important riches
But I still want my liquor, my sorry-ass friends and my bitch
And nigga this me, I only see green like a Marine
Support Calvin Klein jeans, fed a bitch from the Phillipines
With a immoral nose ring (masterbatin' with a magazine!!)
Yeah, I'm acid 9 and half the time undercover
Fuck you, your lesbain lover and your mother with the same brother
The blade runner, my games' tight
I could talk the Virgin Mary outta panties the same night

(Castrophe)
And that's the seventh deadly sin as the terror begins
Me and my friends came to rob ya for your props and your ends
Tuck it in, my niggas want, whatever's costin'
The rings plus the watch, plus thst chain from the slossin'
Son, that's why I go in and shit stop
Last night my nigga Ice-T had to pop a cop
I write the chop-chop lyrics, tryin' not to scratch the detail
I put 'em through the system, slang 'em out at full retail
It's thirty g's for the title and the ki's
Throw in the extra three and take the tyres and the D's
Nigga please, this is lik-wit and I'm the Alki
At three months from now you're gonna read all about me
One cause I smoke 'em, two cause I'm wealthy
Three because I rapped on my nigga Ice's LP
It's Castrophe, lik-wit fam, lik-wit crew
West Coast is in the house nigga, what you wanna do?
(Chorus: Marc Live)
Yo, yo, yo motherfuckers can't fuck with this, realness
Seventh sin deadly, raise the key to rock steady
Run son the hour has come, touch ya
Remember this, real niggas don't rhyme
We walk up and buck ya
Stuck ya in the head, rush ya
Trife niggas knife you, seven venoms fight you
Your life's through, fuckin' with the wrong click - kapow!!
From the crackhouse, niggas quick to blow your back out

(Outro: Marc Live)
Yeah, seventh deadly sin bitch
Ice-T, Marc Li-ive, Ras Kass, Castrophe...
(CJ Mac)
I still sell around the club, grips and bloods and hoodrats, all around me
Ain't nobody guards, but ain't nobody tryin' to clown me
Hehe, my ass motherfucker try an' test
Last six days your whole gay crew, buyin' vests and ass bets
Hit it like DeNiro and Pacino gettin' head like I'm Little Nickie
Play the "Casino", greedy bitches gettin' blown like Sharon gettin' stoned
But this ain't no fuckin' movie, ain't nobody yellin' "cut" and gettin' up
Fuck the bullshit, I pull quick and unload
Leave a nigga ass - bumpy like a toad
And stay trippin', accused of crippin'
And ain't the Nine shit that stay flyin' by in six-hundred giant shit
Ooh wee, look at me, keep it rollin' and I remember
Back when my draws were stolen, but valued to keep it ballin'
Fuck you and a nigga tryin' to speak
Realsome player shit ain't too played out to get deep - motherfucker!!

[Intro: Ja Rule & Jennifer Lopez]
(Murder Inc)
What's my motherfuckin' name?!
R-U-L-E
Blowin' back on this Mary Jane, I'm analyzin' the game
And the game done chose me
To bring pain to pussy niggas & pussy hoes
They're one in the same
Ever since you told me
There's only room for two, I've been makin' less room for you
Now only God can hold me
Hug me, love me, judge me
The only man that hovers above me, holla

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
I met so many men and it's like they're all the same
My appetite for loving is now my hunger pain
And when I'm feeling sexy, who's gonna comfort me?
My only problem is their insecurity

[Pre-Chorus: Ja Rule, Jennifer Lopez, Together]
Tired of being alone, yeah, yeah
Sick of arguing on the phone, yeah, yeah
Are you telling all your friends, yeah, yeah
That your nigga don't understand my love?

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez, Ja Rule, Together]
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

[Verse 2: Ja Rule with Jennifer Lopez]
Girl, I've been thinkin' 'bout this relationship
And I wanna know is this as good as it gets?
'Cause we've been through the worst times and the best times
But it was our time, even if it was part-time
Now they been lookin' at me, smilin' at me
Laughin' like we wasn't happy
But not knowin' that we're growin' and we gettin' married
Hard lovin' and straight thuggin'
Bitch, I ain't doin' this shit for nothing
I'm here to get it poppin', hop in', let's ride up in the Benz
Hair blowin' in the wind, sun glistenin' off my skin, hey
I'm nasty, heh, you know me
But you still don't fuck with your baby

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez, Ja Rule, Together]
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
Now people lovin' me and hating me, treating me ungratefully
But not knowing that they ain't making or breaking me
My life I live it to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again, baby, now I can breathe again
Now people screaming what the deal with you and so and so
I tell them niggas mind their biz, but they don't hear me though
'Cause I live my life to the limit and I love it
Now I could breathe again, baby, now I could breathe again

[Pre-Chorus: Ja Rule, Jennifer Lopez, Together]
Tired of being alone, yeah, yeah
Sick of arguing on the phone, yeah, yeah
Are you telling all your friends, yeah, yeah
That your nigga don't understand my love?

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez, Ja Rule, Together]
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you
'Cause I'm real
The way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk
'Cause I'm real
The way you stare, the way you look, your style, your hair
'Cause I'm real
The way you smile, the way you smell, it drives me wild
'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I can love you (I can love you), I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can
I can love you (I can love you), I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
Sitting here, wondering why you don't love me
The way that I love you and baby
Have no fear, 'cause I would never ever hurt you
And you know my love is real boy I can

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I can love you (I can love you), I can
I can love you (I can love you), love you
I can love you better than she can
I can love you (I can love you), I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
I know sometimes can get rough, but we'll make it
We'll make it through the storm and I know
I will try to make sure that you can trust me
And you know the reason why that I say

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
I can love you (I can love you) a little better than she can
(Ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh)
I know that you (I know that you)
Wish that you could be my man (wish that you could be my man)
'Cause I can love you better than she can

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I can love you (I can love you), I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can
I can love you (I can love you), I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
If I told you once, I told you twice, Q-B
Throw the bootie, like a groupie for more ice
Armor truck heist, get a bonus like N'Bushe
In love with you since the days of "Juicy"
Now I watch you play Columbo, Picasso
Tricks inside colassals, turn you castles to brothels, uh!
Who you lovin? Who you wanna be huggin?
Dippin on ya Ninja Honda with Tanisha and Rhonda, wha!
You work more body than Jane Fonda
Physical fitness, Mary Blige be my witness
Under pressure, I lie for ya, die for ya
Ruger by the thigh for you, right hand high for ya
Because of you, I'm inheritin' trillions
Buryin' billions, Bentley Coupe millions
Playin' good samaritan, in the Sheraton
Crack the Dom P's and Remy's, you better hurry in
Who's gone love you like I do? Huh? Wha?
Who's gone treat you like I do? Huh? Wha?
Mary Blige, Lil Kim, hah-hah
Queen Bees, ah-hah, that's me
That's right, Mary J, Lil K

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I can love you (I can), I can love you (love you)
I can love you better than she can
I can love you (I can love you), I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can
I can love you (I can), I can love you (love you)
I can love you better than she can
I can love you (I can love you), I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can

[Outro]
Who's gonna make you feel the way I do?
Nobody, nobody
Who's gonna make you feel the way I do?
Nobody, nobody
(Intro, Paul Wall & 

[Juelz Santana])
Swisha House baby

[Juelz Santana]
Ya boy Paul Wall

[I mean, I know it's a lot of hater on yo side]
Yo I know they over there hatin on your side too

[Oh yea, but'chu know we don't give a fuck about them niggas, man]

(Hook, Paul Wall & 

[Juelz Santana])
We don't give a fuck about you
We tote big guns, front, we'll pop you

[We be]

[Creepin through ya hood]

[Creepin through ya hood]

[Mask low, mean mug, creepin through ya hood]

(Verse 1, Juelz Santana)
I'm down and I'm dirty with this
I'm down to get dirty, ya bitch
Aww man, aww damn
The pound is just hurtin my hip
Fuck with me
I'll show you how them pounds and them birdies get flipped
Play around clown, you'll get found in the dirtiest ditch (Ey!)
He like, yeah I don't give a fuck about who (bout who?)
I'm like, we don't give a fuck about'chu ('Bout you)
Hat low to the front
Lean back, smokin a blunt (Ey!)
See that button? Hit that, dope in the trunk
Nope, coke in the trunk
Nope, both in the trunk
That gun is on my hip too, I been hopin you stunt (Yup!)
You don't want my niggas creepin through ya hooood (Through ya hoood)
You don't want my niggas creepin through ya woooods (Through ya wooods)

So don't play like that (Don't)
Don't act like that (Don't)
If you ain't like that (You know)
(Hook)

(Verse 2, Paul Wall)
I got them windows tinted, five-percent
Presidential limo tint
I can see you, but'chu can't see me
Two-twenty-three with extended clip
Them fifty shots gon' set it off
So fire drill, bitch drop and roll
Gimme that watch, gimme that chain
Empty them pockets and pay the toll
I hang with killas out on parole
Catch ya cut, run and hide
Evacuate, murder-for-hire
Kinda like Omar from the wire
We'll chop ya up like garlic cloves
And cook ya ass, like Elmer the chef
Take ya last breath, put on ya vest
But I'm aimin at'cha head boy, not'cha chest
Now pack the iron, I'll start'cha dyin
Hit them legs and crease ya up
Then I hit the spot with a bad bitch
That'll slob a knob and piece me up
And when ya wake up, in the morning
To the sounds of them choppers roaring
I wear the heat, just like Alonso
We'll leave ya whole family in mourning
I'm in the hood like wig shops
I'm on the grind, on the block
Posted up like Yao Ming
In a low post, I'm on the box
We'll chop ya up like a Screw tape
And have ya hollerin like the Opera
But with my side-kick goin off
I ain't talkin about no T-Mobile partna
(Hook)

[Intro]
I hear you, I hear you, L-Boogie
Remember they used to call you that?
What you say, Lauryn?
You just keep singing, I'mma tell 'em
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you all when it all falls down
(Oh when it all)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophmore three yurrs ain't picked a carurr
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
Oh when it all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this!"
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
Oh when it all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorties holler, "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gonna act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self-conscious I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
Oh when it all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down

Don't stop that shit, keep that shit
Keep that part where I ran out of breath
We ain't doing no punch-ins, man
That's that fake shit
If I was on stage, how I gotta spit it?
It's from the heart anyway
Might cause shortness of breath, ya know?
Couldn't have got nobody better for the job
Thank you very much this a beautiful
Beautiful young lady that's inspired me definitely

[Verse: Gil Scott-Heron]
Us living as we do upside-down
And the new word to have is revolution
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across our often-entered vagina
We learned to our amazement, the untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard
The illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom, free-doom
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary codenames that preceded the bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling
In the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children, and some food to feed them every night
After all is said and done, build a new route to China if they'll have you
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

[Clapping]
{*The song starts with Jay-Z - Izzo (H.O.V.A.)*}

But it's gon' better than The Truth", and to all my niggas, my nigga ??? said:
"I mean ask these but it ain't no Truth, that ain't no Truth right there!"
And he was all like, the Takeover

[Hook: (Consequence)]
(You got to...) Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
All day long, man, we back in town

[Verse 1: Consequence]
Homie check it out I got her mesmerized
So when your hooker choose Cons, she telling you "bye"
Street poetry is how your boy get paid
In that brand new Escalade, metallic, black or beige
And when I walk up in the club, you know I do not pay
Aiiyo my man Kanyeezy, he got something to say

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Aiyyo my name is Kanyeezy from the Roc-A fam
Where the Glocks don't jam, so when we pop, them scrams
See I showed you on "The Champions" how we get down
So don't twist your lips up like Bobby Brown
You got B2K all on your bedroom wall
But if you be with Kan', I'm gonna work your walls
Straight from the South Side of them Chi-Town streets
The top three in the game, with these here beats

[Verse 3: Consequence]
And if you talk about him, aiyyo I take you out
Either with the nine, or the Tec's in his mouth
And if that dime getting friendly then the orgy's at eight
But y'all niggas don't shine, so you couldn't relate

[Hook: (Consequence)]
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (You couldn't relate)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (You couldn't relate)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (Yo, 'Quence?)
So relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down

[Verse 4: Consequence]
'Quence was out the game, now he's back to ball
Drive you insane, drop a tat at the mall
You staring at my rose-gold way too long
But I ain't scared to ride, that's why I wear Teflon
I took her on the ave' and she expect me to trip
But I made her window shop while I bought me some kicks
So if you want the drama, holler at your boy

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
Original rude boy like Pastor Troy
The G-500 is my favorite toy
They say, "He don't look like a thug or a hood"
"But he keep them gorillas, so he still be good"
By the way my name is K, don't forget the A
And the N-Y-E, out in N.Y.C
I'mma still rep the gold, no matter where I go
Everybody say I'm hot, I'm saying I'm cold
Hate when niggas leave the city and switch up they raps
On the real homie, I don't get down like that
I'mma milk the game, 'til we all can eat

[Verse 6: Consequence]
Now the Chocolate Factory is what I bump in my jeep
So roll me up a L, but don't lace it with leak
'Cause that shit'll have me zoning for a couple of weeks

[Verse 7: Kanye West]
Now your momma told you let the cleavage show
'Cause that's the best way to get a nigga with dough
They'll fake a pregnancy, and then call the attorney up
But she ain't know I'm cheaper than IKEA furniture

[Verse 8: Consequence]
Kanye, White, Malik, Little and D
Menace, Skates to Lou and the Puffs from L.B
They know that Consequence be wearing gold and ice
Cause I got out the projects, where it's flooded with mice
Eh shorty, let me tell you 'bout the rules of my nights
It seems I always keep it moving, I don't hit nothing twice

[Hook: {Consequence} (Kanye West)]
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down {Don't hit nothing twice}
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down {Don't hit nothing twice}
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
So relax yourself, or we'll back you down (Kon Man Produc'!)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (yeah! yeah!)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (It's the ROC!)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Aw, damn, Kon Man, we back in town (We back in town)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (We back in town)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (We back in town)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (We back in town)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (We back in town)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down

[Murphy Lee]
Whooooooooooo
Damn, that girl fine, that girl fine, that girl fine
Yo, yo, Kanye, yo turn it up, a little bit, whoo

[Hook]
Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smoke
One look and murder she wrote
She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead..

[Kanye West {*over the hook*}]
Yo, this is a Roc-a-Fella, St. Lunatics collaboration
Chi-Town and St. Louis
She said she ain't never seen Murphy Lee befo'

[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
I called her back from an earlier beep
Fo' in the mornin' they be like "Nah, I wasn't sleep"
Convenient whore stay on top of convenient stores
Keep pictures of me in their Victoria Secret drawer
I keep somethin' hot on tour
Can ya, Kenyatta, make sure they know before what is really in store
See I adore the ones that call me Torhi, true story
I created 'hood rats so these new mice bore me
See I normally settle for sevens, but eights I can't wait
Nines be wantin' time and dimes be wantin' dates
So know I got elevens and twelves
With at least thirteen or fourteen reasons why they fine as hell
I hit 'em up like Blu Cantrell
Hehehehehehehehe hell, I remember when she smashed LaBelle
See most women kinda sneaky like a six-year old
Hey yo they always in the summer, somethin' wrong with their nails

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
What's the point of havin' a girl that's drop dead
That you know don't like you?
She'll run over your head with a motorcycle
I mean the way you look is nice, but there's more to life boo
Cuz I could go to videos and get fo' just like you
I talked to your ex-boyfriend and took a census
But you don't read the cookbook, you just look at the pictures
Matter of fact, when's the last time you looked at the kitchen?
This is gettin' ridiculous, how you gettin' defensive?
Jimmy Choo, Frankie B., bitch you gettin' expensive
I know you fuckin' around, my sixth sense told me
That ain't no male friend that bought you the stereo
She said "He gay anyway, you don't know nothin' about Jamario"

[Hook]

[Intro]
Yo Hip-Hop, Is niggas still talkin bout I can't rap, come on now

[Verse 1]
Look for me, Young K
Took 2Pac beat and got paid
My favorite rapper is Makaveli, Nas and Jay-Z
Eminem, Mase, Biggie Smalls and me
Now if you was my girlfriend, you don't need no guyfriend
He could get his head bust, nigga ain't my friend
Why the hell you lying? Who the hell you trying?
Who the hell you know that threw away his throwbacks
When they suggested they was made by Majestic?
My Answers cost 350, ya nah'mean?
Doesn't even have got her number, we ain't on the same team
You got the hat, the jacket, shoelaces to match
I got the gat ratching new cases to catch
I got my business manager erasing my debt
I mean my credit was so pathetic, I couldn't get a debit
I fill out for a car but shit, they always debt it
My girl come over, try to help me shine
How you gonna help me get a car, your credit worser than mine?
But every time I get a check, you be first up in line
Told you 'bout gold-diggin', bitch, it's worser than lying
You better grow up before I blow up
Have weed rolled up when I show up
Matter fact, we broke as fuck
Ain't nothing left to do except get tore up from the floor up
Shit, that's how I knew you was my girlfriend
So I promise to never pick up smutts
In my Cadillac pick-up truck
They need to get they sit-ups up
They always be colder than you
A little richer, a little thicker, a litter older than you
Probably a little smarter, so they can drop me some jewels
That I could drop back to you to get your ass back in college
So you can be where they at two years from now
But for now, bartender, two beers for now
The second one is for my girlfriend

[Chorus: JAY-Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend, me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end is me and my boyfriend, me and my boyfriend

[Verse 2]
I'm talkin bout when we was in Nissan's, no Benz or such
We wasn't from Switzerland but we'll still go Dutch
Greater man could prob picture like there go us
No styles, just good times, like they're so nuts
We always thought if we had dough, we could do so much
Like you ain't got to save the roach, we can finish the Dutch
Like we ain't have to go coach, told you I'll be paid soon
We ain't got to sit in this emergency aisle just to get leg room
We ain't got to go back to my room
There's only one bedroom that I call my lair
We was V.I.P; Very Imaginary Playaz
But you was my girlfriend, yea, yea, yea, you was my girlfriend

[Chorus: JAY-Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend, me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end is me and my boyfriend, me and my boyfriend

That's Right (Kanye)

[Chorus: JAY-Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend, me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end is me and my boyfriend, me and my boyfriend
Yep!

[Intro: Kanye West]
Heavy hitters fo' life
Heavy hitters fo' life
Mm, mm
Mm-mm

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You rappers think I give a fuck about the way that they spit
Wanna be on my album, but don't want me on they shit
Everybody thought I was making a compilation
I was really making myself they compe-tation
Fresh off the plane from the All-Star game
Bone girls on TV, so it's All-Star trains
Just picture, man (Uh-huh), no snitchin', man (Uh-uh)
Something for the fiends fresh out the kitchen, man
Last 9/11, I was poor on the ave', 'til I pluraled my math
Now it's Porsche 911 and I'm flooring the gas (Errr!)
Got a lot of problems, money's one that I not have (No more, ugh)
Well, Dame look at how everybody changed
Tell Jay that I'm 'bout to change the game
Tell Biggs that we about to get paid
All my niggas is 'bout to have it made
This makes everything else sound played
"Goddamn, Kanye!" ("Kanye! Kanye!")
Now hold up! Ain't nobody messing with me, dog
Now, you say it! ("Ain't nobody messin' with you at all!")
I told dude, "You can't even rap on my interlude"
Now, does that make me as rude as Jude?
("When the album coming out?") Man, the people is asking
Yamamoto, Adidas, he's sick with the fashion
You already got dough, so you spit for the passion (Ugh)
The way you rhyme give me Tribe Called Quest flashbacks
And let's not even bring up the tracks, man
Nope, nope, let's not do that, man
You eating up the game like Pac-Man
And got the whole world shaking just like crack fiends

[Hook: Kanye West]
Heavy hitters, fo' life (Woo!)
Roc-a-Fella is fo' life
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up
Throw your diamonds (Just let the beat ride out for a minute)

[Interlude: GLC & Kanye West]
Let's take it there, take it there, man
Champ 'posed to be, GLC
Can't be the champ, you ugly
GLC, where you at homie?

[Verse 2: GLC]
How many niggas you know that put their life on the line
To get signed? Did a few high crimes, almost had lights-out
After the sunshine, you thinking it might count
How could I might doubt? Just look at my account
I used to work at the mall with nothing at all
Seeing niggas that ball, that shit was depressing
Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I ain't with the pressing
When I copped them pounds, it was my best investments
Dre got shot (Aww) and that taught me a lesson
For stickin' niggas up in them robbery masses
Mask like Batman, minus the tight pants
Would hit your baby momma, but her elbows is ashy (Uh-uh)
Four different blues, man, your outfit is clashing (Ha!)
You ain't got no muscles, you weak, lame bastard (Haha)
Man, look at your haircut
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, NAW, your hair sucks!
How many niggas you know is really heavy hitters?
'87 Go-Getters, two hoes like John Ritter
Even did it on his crime picture and yeah (Ugh, ugh, ugh)
And offers to sell and yell, ugh

[Hook: Kanye West]
Heavy hitters fo' life
Roc-A-Fella is fo' life
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up
Throw your diamonds

[Outro: Rude Jude]
Yo, what up?
This is Rude motherfuckin' Jude
A.K.A "The Tapioca Stroker"
A.K.A "The J-Man"
A.K.A "Rascal Lovato"
A.K.A "That guy"
Think about it
Now I-
I'm over here chillin' with Kanye 'cause we got a lot in common, you know what I'm sayin'?
He got a unique style, I got a style of my own
I've been listening to the radio and shit and I've been hearing a lot of high pitch singy songs on the background
I'm like, yo, "Yo, Kanye, that's your shit, that's your shit!"
He's like, "Nah dawg"
So you you don't gotta be a mathematician or a muhfucking marine biologist to figure this shit out
Motherfuckers is bitin'
So please, do yourself and everybody else a favor
Take that style that you had
Put it in an UPS package and send it back to Kanye's house 'cause he want his style back

[Hook: Kanye West]
And we gone stay hustling on the block until we caught
And we gone stay showing off that jewelry that we bought
And we gone stay heated in case it's in and out of court
Cause we some gangstas, I don't know what the fuck you thought

[Verse One: Ludacris]
Sometimes I think that I gotta see a little bit of brighter days
Cause I confine myself to a city near you in a solid cage
And you could look to the left and the right, but I'm trapped on center stage
And I could rap to the beat, but I don't know how to change my wage
I still hear a pull and I track 'em, and strack 'em, and whack 'em
Jack a nigga for the Dana Danes and I yak 'em, attack 'em, and sack 'em
Get a weapon and I crack his brain cause I'm hustler, baller, pro
And it wouldn't be right for me to be around busters, and crawlers, and hoes
But I'm a pimp at night so talk shit and I'm gonna lift 'em up off of their toes
With a street sweeper regulating quarters, and ki's, and o's
In the two seater, Ludacris and Twista with bags of 'dro
Smoking and choking, get 'em up and croaking
It's so potent, I'm hoping to keep on floating
Soaking wet and you can bet, people I'm high
I'm seeing lions, and tigers and bears - oh my!
And I can't hide it and keep it hidden, good riddance of feeling good
I'm weapon-concealing, stealing my neighborhood
Would, could, and should break a nigga off
They'll see you later, go to the doctor, hold my balls and (cough)
Because the vapors and I caught the drawn, brain blown, honey I'm home
Give me the microphone, and fools is like, "leave me alone!"

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Twista]
Throw it up if you get high, get blowed, get drunk
If you on what I'm on come on and kick it, let's ride, smoke 'dro, beat the trunk
All the bad ass bitches that want to party, just shake it, great players get pumped
Me and my thugs and hustlers in the party, get money, fuck hoes, get crunk
(Look out) Put a little bit of hash and some motherfucking purple haze
I feel it all over my body, adrenaline with the Bacardi
Got me up and then ripping shit in a rage
In the netti confetti with a belly, gucci
Timberland stepping on the pedal up in the 'lac truck
Want to get me for the wood
Better get the whole motherfucking 'hood to come and give you some back up
We can get into it and if you want to do it
I'm leaking the fluids out of the bodies that want to come at this
If they ever got some blood for fucking with thugs that I bury
My adversaries better not want none of Twis'
Represent for the city, anybody that different with me
Got into thinking its a game
And whether you in my city and I talk shit
I'm going to kill him, especially if he say my name
I've been known to handle my business
Or I'm gonna stick him up for the scrilla, from K-Tilla, smoking on a fat pilla
Murder haters that I'm full of
Niggas claiming they wanna bring a baretta they'll be killas
Balling out so hard the size of my rims grows to a hellafied sight-scene
When the dough become no bigger, I'm gonna still drop that 2003
(Throw it up if you...)

[Hook] - 2X

[Produced by Kanye West]

Holla, holla, hollaaaaa
Holla, holla, hollaaaaa

[Verse 1]
Maybe it's me, maybe I bore you
No, no it's my fault 'cause I can't afford you
Maybe Baby, Puffy, or Jay Z
Would all be better for you
'Cause all I could do was love you

[Chorus]
Baby when I used to love you
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you
Anything you asked me to
But I'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
I realize that I just don't love you
Not like I used to
Holla, holla, hollaaaaa (yeaaahh)
Holla, holla, hollaaaaa (yeah, yeah, uh, uh)

All I could do was love you

[Chorus]
Baby when I used to love you
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do

You're gonna miss me now... ohhh

[Chorus]
Baby, when I used to love you
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you
But I'm not gonna play the fool
No, I can't live this life
And I can't justify
And I can't make up my life
I don't love you
Not like I used to do

Holla, holla, hollaaaaa (yeaaahh)

[Intro: Woman (Kanye West)]
(First of all, this song right here got...)
You say what is it that you want?
(...a long ass intro)
You got everything that a woman could ever need in life
(you got everything)
You got a closet full of minks, Chinchilla
(You got beats from Kanye)
I got a bureau full of diamonds
(What else ya need?)
I can change four times a day if I want to
You even tryin' to eat lobster and drink champagne
Now you know that ain't your roots
For you strictly a collard green and cornbread bit
Now you know if anybody know it, I know
But since you feel like that this evening
Sit down (Know what?) and drink some champagne with me
And let me rap to you

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You'll never catch me in that baby momma Benz again
I'm pushin' a G5
All the girls sayin' that his hair look Indian
And ain't never seen him and MCM
Now I don't like fake boobies but I'd do it to Lil' Kim (Yes I would)
We gon' roll this weed
We gon' play like Sonny Bono and hit these trees soon as we get alone
I'm doin' beats for pro bono soon as we get to bone
Now she like a lot of clothes, I like to see her out of 'em
She got a lot exposed, pump up the volume
Pump up the volume, dance, dance
Don't give Kanye a chance
'Cause I'm a Gemini with two sides and two rides
Y'all talkin' business, I'm peepin' her thighs
Look, I'm tryin' to hit that back end 'fore I get that back in
Called Trina and "Do she need that beat tracked again?"

[Hook: Kanye West]
'Cause I came back for you
To show you that I'm workin' with a little somethin'
And we get the session pumpin'
See, I came back for you
'Cause any rap chick that look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Back when Eve went with Steve before she had her weave
I was sendin' beat tapes like you wouldn't believe
Back when Foxy had a group with Nas and AZ
The way she looked on Chyna Doll, I woulda did them beats for free
'Cause only recently I been gettin' a decent fee
The checks I got from D-Dot was t-teasin' me
I bought some earrings like, "Baby, that may be fake"
But at least it got girls callin' me 'Babycakes'
Now maybe Kay can get a ménage with Lazy K
And Lady May, maybe, hey?
You're lookin' all thick and sweet
You need a nigga that can give you dick and beats
So go and get Angie and tell her

[Hook: Kanye West]
'Cause I came back for you
To show you that I'm workin' with a little somethin'
And we get the session pumpin'
See, I came back for you
'Cause any rap chick that look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price

[Outro: Kanye]
Got a two for head sale
Send, send headshots first though
Will you beat tapes for who? Oh, Trina?
Oh, I'm right there, I'm right there
I'll be the- I'll be in studio in five minutes
Yo yo, she said she want her ass look gushy wet
I told her all I need is my back end check
I told her to—
I ain't finish that verse

[Chorus: Kanye West]
My raps is better than yours
My plaques is better than yours
My tracks is better than yours
You can have one but I have to charge

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
We can start with the hits on my arm I already got the bomb
Now all I need is my first LP to go gold
Then I will have the qualm uh-uh uh-uh uh-uh
I'm Kon the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my Mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom
Still might throw on a little low arm they want me to stop go on go on
They don't want me to shop and me spending that hard
Oh my God is that a black card
I turned around and replied why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express

[Chorus: Kanye West]
My plaques is better than yours
My raps is better than yours
My tracks is better than yours
You can have one but I have to charge

[Bridge: Kanye West]
La La La La La
Off MTV
La La La La La
When you gonna go out with Me

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Brains Power and Muscle like Dame Puffy and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle don't know you don't discuss you
Every rapper want to know when they can get to work
Every stylist want to know where they can get the shirts
Everybody ripping my style like the shit that hurts
But they don't give me my credit that's the shit that hurts
There's something I might say There's something I might play
A beat I might made might make they life change
And save they whole deal They wrist is on chill
They house is on hill You could be Lauryn Hill
See y'all write songs to keep the lights on
I'mma go in Def Jam and turn the brights on
Man I'm just sayin
When I wanted to rap y'all thought I was just playin
Now y'all just prayin

[Chorus: Kanye West]
My raps is better than yours
My plaques is better than yours
My tracks is better than yours
You can have one but I have to charge

[Verse 3: Common]
You was a vic in high school, now you a thug?
Better step in the name of love
Before you giving pain a hug
Needing dope is like pain to drugs
Or aiming slugs til the game unplugged
Like a scoreboard with vice and warlords
Hot merchandise prices they want more for it
You was pink as ice single need to think it twice
Over the bitch and you came out like freaks in the night
Freed your mind at a cheaper price
On the street trying to seek advice
I'm on point like I speak to dice
Took the underground at a steeper heights
May real niggas see the light, got fat girls eating right

[Outro: Kanye West & Common]
Haha, we in this bitch, yeah
Hahaha
It's Common and Kanye
Y'all niggas know what time it is, motherfuckers
Chi-Town, DJ Pharris
Heavy Hitters what up?
Mike Love What Up?
DJ Enuff
Pharrell! That's my favorite producer by the way
That's why I had to rap on this
'Cause his tracks is better than yours
My tracks is better than yours
Just Blaze tracks is better than yours
You can have one but we all gonna
Charrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrge aaawwwww
Plain Pat, what up?
Big John, what up?
John Mnop, what up?
Don C, what up?
J.B., what up?
GLC, what up?
Bang, what up? Yeah
Really Doe, what up?
Arrowstar, what up? Yeah!
Oh, and did I mention the new head of my management, Benny Medina?
Yo G, Hop, we taxin these niggas right now
Plain Pat what up? That's all

[Intro (Kanye West)]
You like to ride... (uh)
(So "why don't) you and your friends (get with) me and my friends"
"(My friends) my friends, my friends, my friends"
Would you like to ride?
(I don't know what happened, it's just like, heh)
"So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
"My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I had that little ass Nissan at your crib showin' up
Liquor store out of Arbor Mist, we Irish Rosed it up
Then we rolled to the movies, you rocked your fake Chloes
You had Gap and Gucci, that's still two G's
But that's that last year purse like it's still too cheap
Ooh you so bougie boo you could have fooled me
'Cause five years ago you was so Fugees
Now you don't want nothin' unless it cost a few Gs
You like the light-skinned Ania, the dark-skinned Aaliyah
The black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita
You remind me of my Jeep, but not no Kia
We can talk on your cell, but not Nokia
It be goin' in and out, that's why I barely hear ya
It be goin' in and out like a robbery ah
I'm tryin' to take this money like Rob and G. Dep
Then I'mma take you to the house like Trick and Trina

[Hook]
Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade
"So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
"My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"
Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away
"So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
"My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"

[Verse 2: Malik Yusef]
Malik Yusef, bet your baby momma know the name
The most critically acclaimed wordsmith in the game
I give you words spit with flames
Stay to myself and let nerves mix with lames
Connoisseur of Kama Sutra, do somethin' absurd with your dame
I used to love this girl who loved shoppin' and smokin' herb
But my job was to hustle 'dro
Now an artist of the spoken word, I just hustle flow
Never a pretty boy, always a beautiful mind like Russell Crowe
Now you in places no cabs'll take you, only the bus'll go
I would love for you and your friends to get with me and my friends
But the problemo is your attitude be on the stank side
And I no longer like you
Fuck it, now you can't ride but ooh, wouldn't you like to

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Common]
Deep as the ocean is the motion of life
Thought you would have been the sister I chose for my wife
Not knowin' you was trife
Stiflin' a nigga's growth
All you wanna do is shop at River Oaks
Watch soaps on the couch, take shit and smoke
I'm workin' hard like a fiend tryin' to get some dope
Thought my real nigga quotes would make you truer
You ain't gon' let me school ya, at least let me tutor
The sex is good, but you ain't a shooter
There's a war goin' on inside, you ain't a trooper
I look through the mirror and see my reflection
It ain't in your direction so I passed her like a reverend
Returned to my Bishop Juan ways goin' Wild West like Kanye
Wherever I lay my kufi is my home, goddamnit I'm grown
Broke broad I'mma leave your ass alone
You still wanna ride though

[Hook]
Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade
"So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
"My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"
Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away
"So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
"My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"
Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade
"So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
"My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"
Like a cloud in our sky, grab your things let's fly away
"So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends"
"My friends, my friends, my friends, my friends"

[Intro: Kanye West]
Long Beach, stand up! (Plain Pat, what up?)
It's your hometown boy Mark Spitz and uh
Now I've been getting fucked up all night long
This weed and this drink I got is almost gone
And I've been doing wrong my whole life long
So here's my song
Here's my song

[Hook: Mark Spitz with (Kanye West)]
Five pounds of dro
Five rounds or mo'
Tore from the flo'
Two sets of hoes
K. West to go
(Okay no more for me
Okay one more for me)

[X2]

[Verse 1: Mark Spitz]
Let me talk on this
Let me walk on this
Mark Spitz extra clips of hollow tips
I'm full throttle with Chicago trips
Hits model chicks without the bread
Moet bottles flip, I'm out my head
Yeah
Okay no more for me
Fuck it, one more for me
Send another round around for all my Gs
Quarterback in the streets
Throw a zip for three
Mr. MC on the beats that still spin when I freeze
In the city by the sea, bitch
Feel the breeze
Hot head, I got steel to squeeze
See easy

[Refrain: Mark Spitz]
The west is on my back, K. West is on the track
'kay?
Now we fiend to get it jumpin' like the jacks
Dimes and hoodrats, get down on the flo'
And pop that ass 'til it's time to go

[Hook: Mark Spitz with (Kanye West)]

[Verse 2: Mark Spitz]
I came to the club with a gang of niggas
But I left from the club with a gang of bitches
Just got my pimp cup now my name is Bishop
In a money green suit, ice cane and lizards
The P chain still hangs but it's changed to Spitz
The blues always authentic gangsta shit
Now take this and run with it
Go have fun with it
But make sure you bring it back when you're done with it
Long Beach done done it again
It's been ten
And we've been it since then as little kids
You niggas can't tell me shit on how to sell with this
I'm hot as hell, we done done it again

[Refrain: Mark Spitz]

[Hook: Mark Spitz with (Kanye West)]

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Don't worry Chi-town
It's ya boy Kanye To The
I got this!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You at the bar tryin' to ask what that Hypno hit fo'
If you gotta ask that you can't afford to get mo'
Dawg, slow down you can't afford to sip Mo'
Leave the club now, come back when you get dough
Many hoes, many many many many many hoes
Centerfolds, especially I'm in the Go
Cadillac back to back, red, black to indigo
Tell me that I ain't pimpin' yo
Especially they in a row?
Keep a least two, that can't keep they cool
Cause I stay G'd up like the first week of school
Broke girls, I take 'em to the Section 8
Where I pass the dick around like a collection plate
White girls said, "La Di Da Di, we love to party"
And that bitch ain't broke so that mean she sniff coke
And she only 17 so that mean she can't vote
So if we do anything, that mean you can't quote

[Hook: Mark Spitz with (Kanye West)]

[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard and Kanye West]
Yo, this is Dirt McGirt
I'm chilling with Kanye West
He's killing y'all niggas on the beats
He's killing y'all niggas on the tracks
Where your plaques at, dog?
The game is officially over
Go kill yourself

[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Now, take that equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore?
Guess not, motherfucker—it's the Roc, motherfucker

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Now, y'all gon' stop talking that shit that you talking
Your broke-ass mama couldn't afford that abortion
Now, tell me, how the hell she gon' afford that coffin?
Now, I done sat back and seen it all too often
The backbone of this, like Marino to the Dolphins
Most hits out the Chi since Sosa and Andre Dawson
My niggas had Pro Tools, I had no tools
Karaoke machine, fuck it, I'm old-school
Only difference is my tracks drove niggas postal
So I drove coastal while they stayed local
How I can't rhyme when my freestyles'll roast you?
Sit down, I'll coach you while we style in posters, dog
Niggas had a chance to sign me, dropped the ball
I'll see you at the awards
Now, after all that it took
I made it to the Roc—I guess I ain't as dumb as you look

[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Now, take that equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore?
Guess not, motherfucker—it's the Roc, motherfucker
Now, take that equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore?
Guess not, motherfucker—it's the Roc, motherfucker

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now, I show you how to do this, dog
Put a few beats on the tape, I saved this one for myself
I heard you niggas' tapes, need a little bit of help
But I'm rapping, and I can't do nothing for you, man
Ask Gee and 'Hop, this 40 grand if you ain't fam
I mean, if you ain't Hov, if you ain't Cam
Damn, I know you say, "He's killing hisself"
"He got a little-bitty deal; now he feeling hisself"—yup!
Just 'cause I play beats and act hospitable
Don't mean I can't get you changed to "hospital you"
I'm from a raw family, dog, and I'll spit on you
So play like a kid in the garden and get little, you
Who your hypeman? I'm curious
It got you souped up like the cars on the Fast and Furious
Here go a new movie for you critics called "Who's Laughing?"
The first producer that rap better than the rappers

[Hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Now, take that equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore?
Guess not, motherfucker—it's the Roc, motherfucker
Now, take that equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore?
Guess not, motherfucker—it's the Roc, motherfucker

[Bridge: Ol' Dirty Bastard & Kanye West]
Aftermath still making them hits, nigga
Lunatics still making them hits, nigga
So So Def still making them hits, nigga
Bad Boy still making them hits, nigga
Wu-Tang still making them hits, nigga
Ruff Ryders still making them hits, nigga
Cash Money still making them hits, nigga
Dirt McGirt still making them hits, nigga

[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo, the game is over, go kill yourself!
Go kill yourself, nigga!
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yeah, yeah - I used to front when I write songs
Talk about havin ice on, and I could barely keep my lights on
And my beats was so sick, I shoulda got a medic
But my credit was so pathetic I couldn't afford a debit
When The Dropout dropped, I had to cop me a money tree
To front on anybody who ever tried to front on me
With so much personality, what do you want from me?
I could be by myself and enjoy the company
My life, this year, my career, is the Lord
Bad chick, this award, is for Melyssa Ford
'94 I could only afford this Accord
From the home of gangbangin and we all outdoors
Southside, outside, Westside, let's ride
Eastside, right B-Side, Lakeshore Drive
And I'm (and I'm) Chi-Town's finest
Where you at? The whole city behind us

[Hook: Kanye West]
Where you at? The whole city behind us
Where you at? The whole city behind us
Southside, outside, Westside, let's ride
Where you at? The whole city behind us

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
It ain't nuttin to it but to do it! I came here
To shut the place down 'til my body stops pumpin red fluid
A-Town I've been through it! And we steady gettin tested
But ready to fill your bubble when we put the lead to it
Out West they still bangin, up top it's really gully
Down South we get buck and turn hearts to Silly Putty
Ludacris I got silly money - you got jokes?
I'll be laughin all the way to the bank - now that's really funny!
Big city bright lights - and many pity cause we like fights
May be long days but it's fright nights
Living out the night life - and people asking 'Where You At?'
Not the club; I stay in the get right!
Hotlanta home of the booties and the really tight skirts
Where if somebody moves then somebody gets hurt!
From Decatur down to CP, and EP
Adamsville to the battlefield it's D.T.P

[Hook]

[Verse 3: The-Game]
It's Compton's prodigy
Obviously I'm from the home of hydraulics
Where they tie bandanas around the steerin column
Of Impalas in to get holla
We fightin pitbulls and Rottweilers
In the projects the objective is make dollars
'Where You At?' It ain't a problem to get it there by tomorrow
Cause I got a female friend, with frequent flier mileage
I ain't never been to college, got the IQ of a Rhodes Scholar
If you follow G-Unit throw up your dubs and yell holla
To all the Y.G.s in khakis and white tees
With And 1's in every color like Ice-T
I might be the city of Compton's right knee
The way I paint pictures with these hip-hop scriptures
Pay attention while The Game shine like a prism
Glisten, show you how canaries can alter one's vision
Not to mention I am Dr. Dre christened on behalf
Of Luda and Kanyeezy, I'm gon' breathe easy

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Verse 1: Rakim]
Uh yeah, is y'all ready for 20-07? It's now another drought
Everybody's a killer, wow, we buggin' out
Since '86 showing the crowd what I'm about
And they still wanna know when the album coming out
Ask the teenagers, OG's and nasty kids
What their definition of "classic" is
Timeless, so age don't count in the booth
When your flow stay submerged in the fountain of youth
Ain't no doubting the truth, I'm off the meters
Everybody cosigning, even non-believers
Since I came in the door became one of y'alls leaders
In a fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers
Uptowns, we call 'em uppies when they're on divas
Probably worn when KRS-One teaches
Nas made you look before the heaters
I bet you Kan' had em on when he walked with Jesus

You can't buy this Superfly-ness, like a shine is
Your Highness is performing; look how long the line is
It's what happens when you make shit that's timeless
It's what happens, these rappers is the pioneers
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is?
That's so novice, I'm so polished
I got a right to be a lil bit snobbish
I did a lil bit of college
Semesters, it took two, like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasn't my place
The beat's slow, 'til you listen to my pace
‘Cause I be killing shit, but that's evident
And y'all feeling it, but I expected it
If it's classic, it's gon' last forever then
I'm everywhere you never been, and better than I ever been

Hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Nas'll rock well

[Verse 3: Nas]
Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper
To them, it hurts to hear this
Oh, you went platinum? Yeah, that's nice
Now let me see you do the same thing twice
Three times, four times, then a couple of mo' times
Please, you're Amateur Night, it's Showtime
It's one life to live, so live it the best you can
The world could use one less man
Not enough air, not enough car factories
To manufacture new vehicles, sedans and vans
When they do make the whip you like, your chips ain't right
By the time you could afford it, the car ain't important
In the streets I'm in, it's just iron
Cops keep firin' in my environment
Leaving you slumped, then they drive home
Far from the hood, brothers they eager to jump on
I like to be the wall that they toast up on
I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong
I'm classic like the Air One's, the hustler shoe
That's what I'm accustomed to, yeah

"Of course - we have Blastmaster KRS-One"

[Verse 4: KRS-One]
How many of y'all got Criminal Minded?
You, you, you; y'all don't be blinded
Me, I got no jewels on my neck
Why? I don't need 'em, I got your respect
KRS-One, twenty years I rock
I do it for JMJ and Scott La Rock
This hip-hop and we's a nation
Don't you wanna hear more KRS-One on your radio station?
Instead of broadcasting how we smoke them trees
On the radio we need to hear more local emcees
Where you at? C'mon, where you at?
This is the difference between emceeing and rap
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal
Emcees spit rhymes to uplift their people
Peace, Love, Unity, havin' fun
These are the lyrics of KRS-One

[Rakim] Kanye West

[Rakim Sample] I'm Rakim, the fiend of a microphone
Yo, I'mma rise to the top cause it ain't in me to fail
Or die bustin' at the cops before they send me to jail
The same nigga ya serve with won't even send you the bail
And sail with some niggas tryin' to send me to hell
So whether
Rap or crack
Beats or streets
This summer I'm rockin' ice to beat the heat
Now I'm gonna cop a Benz 6 and tell 'em "Keep the Jeep
Keep the receipt, keep the change, keep the game."
As long as I keep the fame and keep my name
Kanye to the
Motherfuckin' West
She said, "You from The Outfit?"
I told her, "Motherfuckin' yes."
So every time I spit, it's got to be fresh
So whether freestyle or written
What's the point of rhyme?
I'd rather hear somethin' bitten, as long as it's hittin'
Wack niggas grab my tracks, just get to shittin'
My niggas grab they gats, just get to spittin'
Faggot niggas be like, "Uh huh, no he didn't."
But I did
Ever since I hooked with Syndicate
And shit
I've been blazin' niggas ever since
Ya heard me?
Blazin' niggas ever since

[Intro: Kanye West]
I want everybody to put they hands together for me
I want to talk about somebody real special tonight (whooooaaaa)
Ok, come on

[Hook: Kanye West]
Hey Mama, ahhhhhhhhhh, I wanna scream so loud for you
Cause I'm so proud of you, let me tell you what I'm about to do (hey Mama)
I know I act a fool, but I promise you I'm going back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me, and I, I just want you to be proud of me (hey Mama)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine, I'm feelin' let it shine
I'm feelin' take y'all back to them better times
I'm feelin' talk about my mama if y'all don't mind (hey Mama)
I was three years old when you and I move to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fix me up something that was good for my soul
Famous home chicken soup, can I have another bowl (hey Mama)
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I can keep on my bike
And you would give me anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and the glove, but didn't give me a curl (hey Mama)
And you never put no man over me, and I LOVE you for that Mommy can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
Cause a nigga cheatin', tellin' you lies, then I started to cry (hey Mama)
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said, "Mommy, I'ma love you 'til you don't HURT no more!"
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta WORK no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford (hey Mama)
See your unbreakable, unmistakable, highly capable, lady that's making loot
A living legend too, just look at what Heaven do, sent us an angel, and I thank you

[Hook: Tre Williams, (Kanye West)]
(Hey Mama), Oh your son done turned into a man living life
From the lesson straight from the palm of yo' hand (hey Mama)
And I know well that my words - they just ain't strong enough
If I had to pay for yo' love, my money ain't long enough!

[Verse 2: Papoose]
It's only 60 seconds in a minute, 24 hours in a day
The sun rises, the sun sets & goes away
"How this day went so fast?" is what I thought
Only 12 months in a year - life is short
Before my time is up, you know what I'ma do?
Take this time out to say, "I love you"
Cause right after you finished raisin' all ya kids
You turned right around & raised foster kids
We was the first ones in the 'hood with bunk beds
Popped me in my mouth for somethin' I shouldn't said
& when I caught that case, ya face turned red
You picked me up from the precinct - I was a knucklehead
You told me when I frowned up my face & pout
"I brought you in this world, boy, I'll take you out"
Daddy's stressin' you out? You tired of the drama?
Divorce that fool - I'll marry you, Mama

[Hook x2: Tre Williams, (Kanye West)]
(Hey Mama), Oh your son done turned into a man living life
From the lesson straight from the palm of yo' hand (hey Mama)
And I know well that my words - they just ain't strong enough
If I had to pay for yo' love, my money ain't long enough!

[Kanye West]
Kanye to the...
Yeah, OK

I'm getting spins all day in L.A
We can go the D where Dwele dwell
D.C, P.G or ATL
Back in the Chi, mean my life like a magazine
Honey wanna know the details about my ebony
Well that's XXL
Far as the penthouse, yeah that's upscale
Mademoiselle got a hell of a Black tail
I'm feeling her vibe, her Body and Soul
I heard you stay in a metropolitan home
Well lets kill all the parlayin and offer you a cosmopolitan
Lets jet out the club, get some oxygen
Your friends claim I'm a player, you be lucky to keep me
But you know people gon' be talking 'bout us weekly
My car be in a Robb Re-p-o-r-t but what's more important to me
Is that you..
(Dwele)
Open your ears
Don't allow these words to be ignored by years
Fearing lullibies, containing the same old lies (same old lies)
Dealing just to deal is just a crime
Besides I know you wouldn't mind
Trying something new so..

(CHORUS)
Let's (Let's)Try (Try)
We can work it out
If you let love(love) guide (guide)
The way that you feel for me
Oh(Oh) Why(Why)
Let this opportunity pass (pass) by (by)
You should hold on

Please don't resist (don't resist)
Bless those harmonies to me, escape your lips (escape your lips)
There's no need to go home
Just to dance along (dance aloo-o-one)
I know you can't enjoy it on your own
Really I don't see nothing wrong
With you and I spending some time--

Also let me mention, (Oooh)
My only intention, (Oooh)
Is to feed you every single thing you hunger for---
In my heart I have to (Oooh)
And-- want to have you (Oooh)
So fulfilled that you will never need to ask for more--

[Consequence]
Now someone told my girl that she's a trophy wife
Sorta like Grant Hill and Kobe's wife
So when we at a club, and she be so polite
But when we back at home she be poltergeist
I mean provoking fights
Trying to poke me with knifes
And last time I tried to poke her she just told me goodnight
See her clothing be tight
She was pervert approved
So she gave up on life, now she don't wanna move
Hypnotized by the tube
So she stay with the clicker
In a cup full of liquor
Thinkin its makin her thicker
But its makin her slimmer
So our future is dimmer
I can't remember last time I took my baby to dinner
See I'm sayin' a sister who was freaky and ruthless
In a yorkshire terrier in the pocket with pooches
In a pocket with Gucc's
Was taking my lunch money
Just like the gooches
I'll tell you the truth miss
Intro 

[DJ Boom]
DJ Boom, beats on streets and here with my man Kanye West
Producer of H to the Izzo, Takeover and all that. Let them know man

[Kanye West speaking]
Yo, it's Kanye to the man. Just play my shit man
Let a nigga hear somethin' finally. (Holla)
Yo, DJ Boom, back for the first time. It's really my first time yo
This is...Kanye to the. Not on the beat though
You know what I'm sayin'? ON the beat motherfuckers
What up G? What up Hop? Look, c'mon

[Verse 1]
As a shorty had a Schwinn, look that's the best bikes
Shorty had three friends, that's my best dykes
Said her best friend wanna see what Kanye West like
Cause her man dress like a transvestite
You ain't know I get a deal because I rhyme tight
Sport Rocs before your deal to be an Unsigned Hype
Give a fuck about your rippin' down some open mics
I'm gonna go ahead and give you these beats for free, psych
You rappers too lame, you ain't James, y'all ain't worthy
I fly out to Newark just to get some new jerseys
I be back to Chi about every two Thursdays
I can't buy water around niggas too thirsty
I can't rock ice around niggas too hatin'
Can't rock Motorola, niggas two wayin'
I Alter like Beast in an altercation
Infrared make you juke like Walter Payton
So, grand theft auto
Come up out your auto
Mobile, before I pull more steel than Soprano
Still trying to make more meals than McDonald's
So cut my slice like Giordano's
And they did
I made 500 Gs in this
First beat on what The Truth and The Reason is
She told me if you read music you a genius
I don't play but I'll introduce you to my pianist
Now, tell me that's that regular producer rap
You can listen to the flow and tell I used to rap
You look in my eyes
Think I won't use the gat?
Until
Paramedics gotta use the bag
Cause
In my eyes, you'se the fag
You're like a hermaphrodite dyke dressed in drag
So let's see how many slugs that vest can have
And you ain't really the worst, you just next to last
Uh, Kanye to the...motherfuckin' West
Outro 

[Kanye West speaking]
Yo, DJ Boom, good lookin' out man
Cause ah, niggas is really doubtin'
Niggas lookin' at a lot of motherfuckers they see on TV
And just figure-they be like, "Oh, you rap?"
Naw, motherfucker, I just did beats nigga
To have some shit to rap on nigga
Ha ha, I'm tryin' to understand, why the fuck if a nigga got hot beats
He can't have hot rhymes? Why is that nigga?
Why niggas just can't do a lot of shit good?
What a nigga can chew gum and tie his shoes at the same time?
Fuckin' A&Rs

[Intro] 

[Kanye West talking]
Yo it's your boy, super pro-huhum, I mean super RAPPER Kanye West
I want to shout out all my Heavy Hitters. Yo, G & Hop what up?

[Verse 1]
Was it because of the Roc
That she wanna rock with West?
Because after the Blueprint I got lots of checks
She don't play X-Box but got a box of X
That make her tongue move faster than Das EFX
Uh, white Benz, dyke twins
I ain't gon' lie they only fives but together they tens
And would I do them again?
Hummm, it's like old folks pissin' cause it all Depends
And there's no coke sniffin', just juice and gin
Grey Goose will get you loose then hit the nigga producin'
The track that got you movin'
I never hit a lady but my game might abuse them
Buyin' boots just to tell 'em that I Jimmy choose 'em
And take 'em back to confuse 'em
See she don't know if she's comin' or goin'
Cause mommy after I'm cummin' I'm goin'
Back to the show
Just frontin' and flowin'
Jewelry stuntin' and glowin'
It's like somethin' outta nowhere
Yeah, and I've been known to have a ho or two
Cause my diamond's yellow like a smoker tooth
I tell 'em, "Step into the vocal booth"
Roll a joint, smoke a few
After that I'm pokin' you
After that it's over boo
Baby grab your coat and peeeeuuuun
She said, "I love you K."
"I know you do. If I was you I'd love me too."
Yoooooooou
Not used to what I got to offer
Please get up off me baby, you can't boss me
I wish I would let her dictate
All she can tell me is how the dick taste
How she gonna tell K about L.A.?
When I got three hoes that stay in Marina Del Ray
Well paid, they don't park it, just valet
Waist small like the Motorola Cingular cell-y
Voice high like Mich'elle
I step back like, "Haha
You ever ran for Miss L.A.?"
Cause you holdin' down the city officia-lly
Next time you fuckin' your man, just yell, "K"

[Intro: Kanye West]
Yeah
It's (a million)

[Hook: Kanye West]
I freestyle battle niggas for (a million)
How many niggas bit the soul? 'Bout (a million)
How many hoes did I bone? 'Bout (a million)
Uh-uh, uh-uh, it's (a million), uh-uh
There's (a million) ways to die, choose one
(A million)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Look, lot of people askin' 'bout the money I made, even Just Blaze
How are they for real, is them niggas really paid?
Rappers I met or dealt with direct
Is it true he won't send a beat tape until he get a check?
What's the position you hold?
Can you really match the Neptunes, check by check
If "H to the Izzo" is the only single that went gold?
If Roc-a-Fella shit fold and you move back to the 'Go
Is it back to ghost producer for D. Dot on the low?
For the millionth time askin' me
Questions like Toni Braxton, harassing me
Like, "You don't care about my son's feelings?"
Can I get a minute, you wack bitch? I ain't gotta jack shit
You heard "Takeover", who running this rap shit?
Ugh, fake tits, shut up and make hits
Can't we all just get along, spread love like Take 6?
What, you doin' beats in LA for Eminem and Dr. Dre?
Them niggas sold ten mill, I'm trying to get paid
We do this shit for entertainment
Bring guns to the arraignment
While the judge in the chamber
Let one up out the chamber, BLAOW!

[Hook: Kanye West]
How many years did I wait? About (a million)
How many niggas tryin' to hate? About (a million)
But when a nigga count his cake, it's 'bout (a million)
Yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
'04, College Dropout, I make the game different
I don't know what the hell y'all niggas been sniffin'
'Ye still flicking, hoes is my addiction
Five days out the week, you'll find me in the kitchen
Smashing the game, nigga, unlike you
'Cause these beats change the game and the hook's right too
I'm a crook like you
Cats back in the Chi was buying tracks for dirt cheap
Man, what could I do?
Knowing I'm supposed to style, I'm the fly-boy poster child
'Bout to be on Oprah now
It's ironic and whatnot how I put no ice in the Bulgari watch
Just to make it hot
Now you see me on stages, my hit résumés is two pages
For them niggas who played us
Feet just raises, booming like Masta Ace's
"Stand Up", number one, and there's more to come
All I got for hoes is hard dick and bubblegum
While y'all brick like Fred, Barney Rubble and them
Chi-Town in this bitch, what's fucking with them?
Not a damn thing, nigga, we doing our damn thing, BLAOW!
(A million)
Yeah
(A million)

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole & New Birth]
I've been waiting my life and I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind, it's been way too much time
That's why (It's just impossible)
It's impossible, and you know that

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West & New Birth]
I don't wanna hear that bullshit
I wanna hear that official shit
Kanye and that Twista shit
That's so impossible to get it (It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)

[Verse 1: Twista & New Birth]
Ain't no way that you could pull up to the party
In a Bentley blowing B, gettin' club like this (Oh no)
Ain't no way that you could cook up in the studio
With Kanye and get it jukin' in the club like this
(Oh no, impossible) Ain't no way that you gon' win
Dust some haters off while I'm sippin' on my Henn
Holla at a chick while she sippin' on her gin
And I got the mobsters hollerin' at her friends
(It's impossible) For you to ever be the nicest
You won't get gangsta or get righteous
You ain't never stood on a tip like this
You ain't never stood for no shit like this
(It's just impossible) For you to get it if you don't wanna win
Get up off yo' ass and go for yours, I'm goin' for mine
Now you ain't from the ride what I'm in, know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole & New Birth]
I've been waiting my life and I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind, it's been way too much time
That's why (It's just impossible)
It's impossible, and you know that

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West & New Birth]
I don't wanna hear that bullshit
I wanna hear that official shit
Kanye and that Twista shit
That's so impossible to get it (It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)

[Verse 2: Twista & New Birth]
It's impossible for you to ever get with me
Because of how I ride on the track
Got the bitch in the back of the Bentley 

[?]
Used to have the bitch in the back of the Cadillac
(It's just impossible) Niggas always hatin'
Even before I came out with Po Pimp
You be sittin' back and be talkin' your shit
I can't help but I see you though, I don't get it
(It's impossible) Lil' mama, for you to fit all that ass in them jeans
Movin' kinda wilder, turnin' regular jeans into low riders
Tell me, can I be your man?
(It's just impossible) For you to ever deny that I'm about Chi-Town
Represent the city with the deal for twelve years
And sell a couple of mil' and still hold it down, that's impossible

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole & New Birth]
I've been waiting my life and I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind, it's been way too much time
That's why (It's just impossible)
It's impossible, and you know that

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West & New Birth]
I don't wanna hear that bullshit
I wanna hear that official shit
Kanye and that Twista shit
That's so impossible to get it (It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)

[Verse 3: Kanye West & New Birth]
Get it, roll the weed up and lit it
Smoke a little but don't admit it
Do it like I did, too late, I did it (It's just impossible)
The controversy can't worse me, man
I'm eating but I'm still thirsty and
Thirsty, what is you sayin'?
I got a duel with a couple niggas, that's Thursday, man
Why the hell is I'm worryin'?
Hoppin' out the Benz with the perfect 10
"Man, your life must be perfect, man
Look at how they came up with the perfect plan"
(It's just impossible) It's impossible
Got strip clubs playin' gospitel, flow so sick in the hospital
You know I jammed out like 'Pac'll do
You know you throw your diamonds when I rock with you
Since Michael Jackson made "Rock With You"
I done did shit on Logical
Maybe 'cause we did the impossible
Baby, we done did the impossible

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole & New Birth]
I've been waiting my life and I stayed on my grind
Now I made up my mind, it's been way too much time
That's why (It's just impossible)
It's impossible, and you know that

[Post-Chorus: Kanye West & New Birth]
I don't wanna hear that bullshit
I wanna hear that official shit
Kanye and that Twista shit
That's so impossible to get it (It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)
I don't wanna hear that bullshit
I wanna hear that official shit
Kanye and that Twista shit
That's so impossible to get it (It's just impossible)
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)

[Outro: New Birth]
It's impossible
It's just impossible
It's impossible

[Intro]
Through the wire
To the wall
All my rhymes is raw
All these beats beats beats beats beats
All of 'em coulda been lost
I always got to floss
I almost paid the cost
So before I go...

[Verse 1]
Every sunset feel righter, sunshines feel brighter
Please light ya lighter for the producer and the writer
Feel like God wrote this, I'm just here to quote this
I don't know if you noticed, them accident pictures is bogus
Doctor, doctor, would you please say somethin'?
I know I almost was the final destination
I musta had a blessin' from Pastor Mason
Cause that trip to L.A. coulda been my last vacation
And, man, I know I can
Drop a down payment on that Porsche Cayenne
But, what, I went along with the plan
Paid for my own video, directed by my man
I know God was holdin' my hand
Wouldn't let me go before I went before Def Poetry Jam
Wouldn't let me throw in the towel 'fore I got to throwin' some vowels
'Bout what we goin' through now
Out the blue girls got a crush on me like I did beats for Mr. Cheeks
And since the accident, they tellin' me that it's the cheeks
But if you look at history, the last rapper that almost died
Sold 6.5 'cept I'm comin' from the Chi

[Hook]
Through the wire
To the wall
All my rhymes is raw
All these beats beats beats beats beats
All of them coulda been lost
I always got to floss
I almost paid the cost
So before I go to sleep sleep sleep
Always thank the Lord
For this mic and my keyboard
Hecky naw that boy is raw

[Verse 2]
Now even though I ain't wired up
We-we-we fired up
You ain't seen my concerts lately, they be linin' up
You ain't seen my girls lately, they be tryin' to cut
And they heard about my girl so I still chill
Cause Monica Lewinsky already killed Bill
And that girl that was with Kobe tried to go for the kill
I think he put it in the wrong Holyfield
Can I take a minute with y'all to be totally real?
Far as my jaw and all, it ain't totally heal
If I would have died, 10/23 of last year
That would have threw a monkey wrench in my whole career
But me, I took the worst thing, turn it into the best thing
I'm from the Chi, I guess it's just a Midwest thing
Times like this make life interesting
Times like this make me count my blessings
Cause you could run around like King of the Chi
But God could take that in a blink of a eye
I remember Cedars-Sinai and all those cryin'
Mama, I'm sorry for almost dyin'
Tell Alwe G and Hip Hop man
Tell Don I'ma John Monopolize the game
Add on Benny Medina, we gon' take 'em to the cleaners
I'm Kanye West, the college dropout slash genius

[Hook]
Through the wire
To the wall
All my rhymes is raw
All these beats beats beats beats beats
All of them coulda been lost
I always got to floss
I almost paid the cost
So before I go to sleep sleep sleep
Always thank the Lord
For this mic and my keyboard
Hecky naw that boy is raw

[Outro]
Now if the Roc is in the building say, "Hell yeah!"
Throw your diamonds in the air
If the Roc is in the building say, "Hell yeah!"
Throw your diamonds in the air
If the Roc is in the building say, "Hell yeah!"
Throw your diamonds in the air
Throw your diamonds in the air
Throw your diamonds in the air
Now keep 'em in the air
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
We outta here
College Dropout

[Intro: Kanye West]
You just popped in the Kanye West
Get Right For The Summer workout tape
And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly
You might bear to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude wit' a car
So first of all we gon' work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and get them sit ups right and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick
What's scary to me is Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came..
I came...
I came..

[Chorus: Kanye West]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
'Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out
Then maybe we can work it out (Come on)
Work it out (Come on)
Work it out (Come on)
Work it out (Come on)
Work it out now
Maybe we can work it out (Come on, come on)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set Twista said "Get It Wet"
Ooh girl your breath is HARSH
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS..
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars
Still, kill a nigga on 16 bars
We ain't sweating to the oldies, we juking to a cold beat
Maybe one day girl we can bone
So you can brag to all your homies now
But I still mess with a big girl, if you ain't fit girl, I'll still hit girl
1 and, you brought 2 friends, ok, 3 more now hop in the Benz
4-door: do you know the difference between a 5, 6, 7, 8?
All the mocha lattes, you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers, gangstas, all us ballas

[Interlude: Lil Jon]
STOP! IT'S THA MUTHAFUCKIN' REMIX!!

[Beat changes to Lil Jon's version]

[Verse 3: Fonzworth Bentley]
B-E-N-T-L-E-Y
Yee ain't know, you betta ask somebody
What we gonna do is twirk that body
All day, every day fitness party
Lock them doors, don't tell nobody
Gentlemens in the Gentlemen's Club
And hitting them with an interesting dub
It's upside down that's for the A-Town
What y'all sayin'?
F.J. Bentley caught misbehaving
Yes I'm the captain and I'm saving, all my money
Yes I'm just gonna stand and watch you dance from over here
Matter fact pass the Couvorsier
But I will walk you to your car my dear
Cheers

[Beat changes to original version]

[Chorus: Kanye West]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
'Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out (Come on) 4x
Work it out now
Maybe we can work it out (Come on, come on)

[Interlude: Ladies speaking w/ Kanye in the background]

[Intro]
Yo, it's Kanye To The
I did this beat in '96 and ah...

[Verse]
Is it the because my beats the nicest?
Got me chargin' niggas Dr. Evil prices ("One billion dollars...")
Niggas will sell their soul to go platinum and gold
I'm cold 'cause I got the gold and kept my soul
Drop an album full of soul, sold twelve times gold
That's six-plat, man, that's a sick plaque (Do the math)
Man, don't forget that, that at the top is where you feel the loneliness
Like grabbin' fake titties, I swear, I feel the phoniest
'Cause I'm from a city where you never know who your homies is
'Cause everybody want your spot—No I.D. told me this
Oh, I seen homies get sheisty on me quick
Woooooo! Just imagine if I only spit
But I do beats, too, that's the American dream
Stack to make sure my shawties inherit some things
A couple real estate investments
Got niggas sayin', "There's the Kennedys!"
But oh, yes, it's the Westses
Brand new Roc-A-Fella, most fresh-to-death is...
Definitely Kanye, peace to Sportie LA (Okay, yeah, ugh)
That keep my shoe game early like the grave shift (Uh-huh)
Plus keep my closet cooped up like a slave ship (Woo!)
How you gon' look at me and say I ain't made shit?
Just look at my outfit, I got all the basics (Look)
Air Force, check! Rolex, check!
Call Gee and Hop, did you get the check? (Fifty thousand)
Roc-a-Fella piece, check, don't forget the neck
Is it the money on deck that keeps on the honeys on the dick?
Now, that ain't really rhyme, but I ain't really tryin'
(I don't give a fuck, nigga)
Last 9/11, I was poor on the Ave
'Til I pluraled my math, now it's Porsche 911
And I'm floorin' the gas, got a lot of problems
Money's one that I not have
Date ballplayers' wives, that divorced and got half, shiiiiiit (Oooh! Haha)
I figure they deserve somethin' for all them hours
And that be the realest shit that I never wrote
(Really spoke something on that shit)
Only book I ever read I could have wrote—48 Laws Of Power (What!)
Me, Gee and Hop, uh-huh, the game's ours (What!)
Seems like I got more brain off my fake chain
Than my real one, 'cause on the real, son
If a girl think you broke, she just wanna fuck and smoke
If you paid, then she's thinkin' bout her children, feel him? (True)
Prolly not though, unless you got dough, you know what I mean?
You will think the grass greener when you finally get green
I told Regina, "You ain't been in a Medina" (Quit lying)
Yeah, I seen you grabbin' on my balls like Serena (Uh-huh)
Yeah, y'all the invisible ho, you ain't never seen her
Mhm, she must stay around your grandma crib
Right next door to where the in-laws live
I brought a man from the fifth floor all in y'all crib
Haha

[Outro]
Remember niggas back at school
They didn't have no girl at school
So they be like, "I got a girl, she just stay by my grandma's crib" Hahaha
Yo, Dame, where the fuck you find me? Hahaha

[Chorus]
Goin' back to Honolulu
Just to get that, that Maui Wowie, that Maui Wowie
Goin' back to Honolulu
Just to get that, that Maui Wowie, that Maui Wowie
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high

[Verse]
Yeah, back up in the mix
Aloha nigga, Cudi lookin' for a fix
Got enough dough, just to take a trip
To get a little pinch of the Maui Wowie
Oh man, here we go again
If you ever get a chance, smoke it with a friend
Me and Pat on a mission to get
Lifted like John Legend and shit
Get Lifted
Let's get lifted
What you gon' cop
Maybe a dub, maybe a zone
No matter what you cop, you should smoke it 'til it's gone
Walkin' on the beach with the sand between your feet
And all the Hawaiian girls singin' to the beat
"Hey, what it do boo?
You smoke good?
Yeah, me too"
Livin' in paradise
All through the night
And even in the day
Smoke 'til I can't see
What can I say
Nothin' like this in the world homie
Make you feel great
You forget you in the States, might relocate
So you smoke all the Maui Wowie you could take
Like

[Chorus]
Goin' back to Honolulu
Just to get that, that Maui Wowie, that Maui Wowie
Goin' back to Honolulu
Just to get that, that Maui Wowie, that Maui Wowie
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high
(And I'm so high) And I'm so high

[Outro]
I know, I know, I know
I really need to go, go, go, go, go, go
Really need to go, go
Really need to go, go, go
Man, I need Maui Wowie
I smoke that Maui Wowie
I need Maui Wowie
I smoke that Maui Wowie
I know, I know, I know
You really need to go, go
You really need to go, go, go
Man, I need Maui Wowie
I smoke that Maui Wowie

[Intro]
Cleveland style
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Plain Pat, what up

[Verse 1]
Whoa, Nellie, I don't even think they ready
They flow is too shitty, not me I can't get with it
Gon' with it, Kid Cudi the illy, rep my city
In the navy blue Cutlass, no roof above him
Hoes, they love 'em, model girls I cut and fuck 'em
Hey, I rep that double-O, you ain't on the ho
I got my man Chip the Rip wit' a Spanish bitch takin' flicks
And she gon take a lick, yeah, mami
Later on, we gettin' sushi, mami eatin' edamame
West Coast so I'm ghost, holla at my nigga Travie
We wheelin', pick up the Heroes or the Gym Class topping
The charts with the art that exhibits couldn't exhibit
The grizzle, I live it, run passed the timid livin'
In the bubble, keep the number when I mumble
Wit skill, red-rum them trynna figure out him
Baptize myself in the river of Henn-essy

[Chorus]
Open up your heart and you will understand me
Fall into the music and let yourself go
Open up your heart and you will understand me
Fall into the music and let yourself

[Verse 2]
Go, go, Mach 5 flow
Do you want mo' you shall receive with a sea
Deep in the realm if you felt like you were alone, no fair
Salute the underdog, I am here in the clear
Over there, niggas ain't diff, what if
I was them, I would be a simp, no dopeness
Will ever, ever be my aura (Aura)
Steve Urkel nigga, lookin' for a Laura
Proceed, I am the One, too cliché to call me Neo
If anything dope has arrived rap wise as far as overall killin'
Body, embody him, now that the mores to accommodate the carcasses (carcasses)
My heart is titanium alloy
So if you come up with ploys to destroy my passion
I'ma tell you now, you are better off passin' (Passin')
Stop writin' checks that your ass can't cash in, bro (Bro)

[Chorus]
Open up your heart and you will understand me
Fall into the music and let yourself go
Open up your heart and you will understand me
Fall into the music and let yourself
Open up your heart and you will understand me
Fall into the music and let yourself go

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yo, yo

[Intro: Cee Lo Green]
I got some bad news this mornin'
Which in turn made my day

[Verse: Kid Cudi]
Lord help me out
Save my soul, need to find a new route
I don't even hear what other niggas talking about
Call me a hipster as long as you're a listener
Label me what you like
I'm close to my victory, dozed in the fight
When I open my eyes somehow seeing night
Beyond trying to see what being rich feel like
Six-figure checks, for my mom for peace
Everybody wants to stick on me like leech
Take my blood, give fake love, till I turn them down
I'm the one that who changed, bro?
Ask why I don't call cause when I was starving
You wasn't at all..around,now I gotta shut shit down
Be a man, pick friends, all selective now
You're cool, you're cool, fuck you
And to the bitch that's--oh yeah, fuck you too
Try to shine now everyone knows
Kid Cudi slipped up and loved them hoes
We all make mistakes, yes
No worries I just kill a bitch with success
While she at home stressed out eating ice cream
I'm at the Grammys living out a nice dream
No bitch on arm, just my words and my stoner charm
With my dimples deep, I smile at peace
Cause I went out and got what most y'all seek
Now I'm the one you meet
Who throws you the peace sign, missed not one step
And this is just the first step
God walks with me, but I'm still vexed

[Outro: Cee-Lo Green]
Oh, how could this be?
All this time, I've lived vicariously
Who's gonna save my soul now?
Who's gonna save my soul now?
How will my story ever be told now?
How will my story be told now?

[Chorus]
C'mon feel the noise
Girls grab the boys
Get wild, wild, wild
C'mon feel the noise
Girls grab the boys
Get wild, wild, wild

[Verse 1]
Step it up, let your neck snap back
Uh, saddle up baby-girl put your hair back
Hurry up, barkeep, keep the brew coming
Tryna drank 'til my back start slumping
Like old man, live by them old rules
Fought all the steps in front of the old fools
Got me nowhere, nigga, it's a different time
Fuck '08, niggas thinking '09
I take a look behind, niggas can't form a line
Like Kindergarten waitin' for the water fountain
Standin' up, said, arms crossed, poutin'
Scott Mescudi, boy they was doubtin' him
And 'til they Googled me and found that Imeem
They love a dooder, they love me I mean
I can't believe how I had a dream of Martin King
But they ain't takin' me out on no balcony

[Chorus]
C'mon feel the noise
Girls grab the boys
Get wild, wild, wild
C'mon feel the noise
Girls grab the boys
Get wild, wild, wild

[Verse 2]
Stand up, put your arms to the ceiling man
Show skin, baby-girl, yeah I'm a fan
Won't do you wrong, like a pushover
See my Cutty ridin' through, better pull over
Like I got blue, red lights shining 'round
But if I see the man, slowly put the cup down
"How you doin' Officer? Nice mustache"
Dunkin Donut eatin' muthafuckas hatin', damn
I get my speed-racer on
Playin' Ray Cash, get my Cleveland city on
Brooklyn to Cali, jet-lagged and all
There's still enough time to hit the mall
Shit, one wish when I'm deceased
Bury me in 501's and 10 Deep
And please keep the Bapes on the feet
So I can watch the devil ice-grill me
Haha, yeah, how you like a nigga now?
I'm it like the clown
And Cudi get (Wild wild wild)

[Outro]
I get (Wild wild wild)
Yeah, one, uh
Back, back up in the mix like that
How y'all feel? How y'all feel?
Y'all a'ight? That's right
And it's like that Plain-Pat, holla at me, man
Yeah!
Okay that's the end of my Slade song

[Verse 1]
Listen good, I don't have nobody
But what I might feel are the sounds of sanity
Hoping what I hear loops itself continuously
Then I won't be afraid, no, no

[Chorus]
Oh, whoa, whoa
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right? Do right
Oh, whoa, whoa
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Look at me, you tell me just what you see
Am I someone whom you may love, or enemy?
Am I speaking for you and yours, or someone else?
I need some answers, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, whoa, whoa
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right? Do right
Oh, whoa, whoa
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 3]
My world turns, flippin' the bird
To the ones who figure
Me outcast, no, not the duo
Back in Shaker Heights where they knew who
Dos little brother was a strange one, boo-hoo
Cry me a river, hater, look who
Traveled out an igloo
Cold-cold world wasn't fit for me at all
Look at where I stand at, tall
Clutchin' my Kid Cudi bizzalls
Mute motherfuckers back home, quick pause
Gargle on my mayo
Look at me, I bet I'm the one you think to fail
Floating in my mind, no sail
Ahoy, ahoy

[Verse 4]
Listen good, I don't need nobody
This is, what you feel, are the sounds of insanity
Hoping what I hear loops itself to finish me
No, I won't be afraid, hey, hey

[Chorus]
Oh, whoa, whoa
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right? Do right
Oh, whoa, whoa
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo

[Outro]
Why must it feel so right
When I know that it's wrong? It's wrong
When will I ever learn
From the words in my songs?
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo

[Intro]
We—hm, hm, hm, hm, hm
This one's for Emile

[Chorus]
We, we, we, aight, aight, aight
We, we aight, aight, aight
We, we, we aight

[Verse]
Time to make your mind up, aight
To wake your mind up, aight
It's time to make your mind up, aight
To wake your mind up, hahah, aight

[Chorus]
Ai-aight, we, we aight, aight
We, we, we ai-aight
We, we, we ai-aight
We, we, aight-aight

[Outro]
Make your mind up, mm, mm
To wake your mind up
We ai-aight
We, we, we aight

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Jones
We born to die so i get high just like i'm born to fly
(to the moon)
I'm in the court with marijuana eyes
(sorry judge)
We hit the clubs until the morning rise
('cause of last night)
'cause day n nite
We run the streets hope I don't pay that price
(pray for me)
They got the nerve to tell me press my brakes
And if I do then how will rent get paid, paid
So now I'm thinking that
2OO stacks what would it bring me back
(thinking to flip)
Especially now that recessions here
(it's hard out here)
My only answers to my questions is is
Ok now here's a thought
(1 more thought)
Streets is a marriage that you can't divorce
Life is a bitch but I think I fell in love
So I treat the game just like i'm sellin' drugs

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see, I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Hold the phone
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

[Verse 4: Kid Cudi]
Slow mo'
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new
He seems alive though he is feeling blue
The sun is shining, man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights
They fade away, he slips into his white Nikes
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of, to free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

[Chorus]
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
Wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, I be wild'n 'cause I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chillin' old

[Verse 1]
Liquor all night, love it
Untamed youth, the Coupes moves like bullets
I guess the fact my father smoked and drank
Made it a young nigga destiny to do the exact same
Young wild'n all, me and my Codys
Watch the phonies, and hoes that claim they blew me
Dark skin China doll with the fake tits
Ice grillin' my Spanish chick, word
We all in together, now we off it
Cops be buggin', shotguns on the whip
Fuck 'em, I would never sweat for a piggie
You can catch me high, it's all good, no biggie

[Chorus]
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
Wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, I be wild'n 'cause I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chillin' old
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
Wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, I be wild'n 'cause I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chillin' old

[Verse 2]
Four in the morning, gettin' cozy
So much Goose I let the fires soak it up some
Tuesday weekly, the Legend of the Rager
Most have witnessed the Cud in the club
We don't have Plain Pat ready
Ice is thrown and the whole crew gone
Done off for better and very celebratory
Fuck the blogs, I'ma tell my story
No matter the phase, my name is engraved
In the minds of the youngins who be livin' to they graves
You live and you learn
Doing bumps in the day and keep blunts to burn

[Chorus]
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
Wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, I be wild'n 'cause I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chillin' old
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
Wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, I be wild'n 'cause I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chillin' old

[Verse 3]
Rage, 'cause I'm paid
Take the grey, and create another shade
Awesome, no more bitches playin' possum
Pop and lock 'em and send 'em on home
Tired of hoes, all they want is to get chose
Know the code, want a woman with some toes
Optimos, takin' trips to Australia
Do some blow and hope you make it through the show
Hands, high
Go with your soul and try floatin' through the sky
Hide the pain with some pussy and Mimosas
Costa Rica next on the agenda

[Chorus]
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
Wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, I be wild'n 'cause I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chillin' old
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
Wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, I be wild'n 'cause I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chillin' old

Kcuf a evig t'nod tsuj uoy semitemos
Tihs tuoba erac t'nod tsuj uoy semitemos

[Intro]
Be strong, be strong
You must tell the devil huh, you must tell the devil ha
You must tell these devils, word
You got to tell a devil huh, just tell a devil ha
Word, what? Ha-ha
You must tell the devil huh, haha
Be strong, word
Stand on the rock (Stand up on the rock)

[Verse 1]
When the devil got your soul, and you ain't got control
You know you born again, but you feel like you old
Put your mind on Christ, put your mind on Kris
For everlasting life, you must listen to this
Now you could get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll go with this, yo, Christians, where you at?
Oh, yes, it's KRS, with Church of the Harvest
With Clarence McClendon, hip-hop's winning evangelist
And then there's Hezekiah, his choir brings the fire
He's takin it higher (Tell 'em), the devil is a liar
I know you thinkin' 'bout that Y2K
And I see this fear that makes you lose your way
But we got somethin' that is bigger than bets
And we stand upon the rock that cannot break
Through millenniums, don't you think we been here before?
Through millenniums, God has always opened the door, word

[Chorus]
You must tell the devil huh, you must tell the devil hah
You got to tell the devil, ahh, ha-ha
You must tell the devil huh, you must tell the devil hah
Word, word up, ahh, ha-ha
Word, huh, ha
Ahh, ha-ha

[Post-Chorus]
Be strong (Be strong), be strong
Be strong, word
Be strong (Be strong), be strong
Endure, endure, yo

[Verse Two]
If all you got is money and the little things you wear
You worry 'bout your car note, you worry 'bout your hair
Then you ain't got no faith, and you must live in fear
Now listen to me people, and listen to me clear
So like I was just sayin', I think it's time for prayin'
Don't put your trust in Satan, it's Christ you put your faith in
You minimize your hatin', and stop your hesitatin'
It's faith that keeps you movin', so do not be mistaken

[Chorus]
You must tell the devil huh, you must tell the devil ha
You must to tell the devil, word, ahh, ha-ha, word
You got to tell the devil huh, uh, tell the devil ha
You got to tell the devil, word, ahh, ha-ha, word
You must tell the devil huh, you must tell the devil ha
Word, tell that devil, word, ahh, ha-ha, wo-word
You must tell the devil huh, uh, ha, uh-huh, yo
Ahh, ha-ha, yo

[Verse Three]
Now you listen to these lyrics, they speakin' to your spirit
You shiver when you hear it, but some just cannot bear it
But when you get up near it, there's no need that you fear it
It's KRS O-N-E, you know me, hip-hop be spirit
So you tell the devil huh, tell that devil ha
Tell that devil huh, tell that devil ha
You must tell the devil huh, tell that devil hah
Get out of my life, change your life, word

[Outro]
Be strong, be strong (Strong, strong)
Be strong, be strong (Strong, strong)
Stand up on the rock

[KRS-One]
Gather round, I want to tell y'all a story
See if you can get the meaning
We gonna go real far (all right)
Watch this (God, you alright)

I'm steppin' in this place like it's all right
I got my partners with me, yep we feelin' all right
I got my woman with me, yup she lookin' all right
When it's time to move I'm never left, I'm all right

Well, I met my man "What up Duke?" - "I'm all right"
He said "Listen to this", I said "All right"
He said "This strictly confidential", I said "All right"
He said "Yo, you like this spot?" I said "It's all right"
"You wanna change it?", I said "All right"
"I got a way that we can purchase it in 30 days" - "All right"
"How we gon do that?" He said "All right"
He put a stack of hundreds on the table right there, I said "All right"

30 days later we all right
Limousines, elevators, yo things are lookin' all right
All night everybody feelin' all right
I told my man "I gotta go", he said "All right"
"Let me take your Jeep", he said "All right"
But just as I started the car it got all bright
I started liftin' up, felt my spirit driftin' up
What's goin' on? The Jeep is gone and everything's all white
I heard people sayin' "Is he all right?"
Floatin' above my body I felt all right
How can I tell 'em, really tell 'em, that I'm all right?
Standin' outside my cerebellum I'm all right
The fourth dimension is all right
The fifth dimension is sure right
The sixth dimension is all light
Livin' as a spirit is all right
But then I didn't feel all right
I felt the shock in my chest, it wasn't all right
They revivin' me - all right
I heard a paramedic say to someone "Yep, he gonna be all right"
I'm back alive, people askin' "Are you all right?"
"The Jeep exploded. It's a miracle you all right"
Layin' there on my back, strapped up all night
I smirked and said to myself "God, you all right"
"Ha, you all right"
"Yes, God, you all right"

[Intro: KRS-One]
Call me old-school, but
It's all about love (yeah)
If you ain't doin' this for the love
What you doin' it for?
(Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)

[Verse 2: KRS-One & Carlet Boseman]
When I'm on tour I spread (love, baby)
The greatest law is (love, baby)
For sure, sex is not (love, baby)
Love is love, have you had a hug lately?
I ain't waitin' for the system to save me
I'm standing up, using what God gave me
Old-school, Kris is no fool
How we gonna organize with no tools?
Man, we gotta do it for the (love, baby)
Respect and more (love, baby)
Less checks and get more (love, baby)
K-R-S One!

Put down the gun and show (love, baby)
We ain't never gonna grow without (love, baby)
Hip-Hop started with (love, baby)
Not shooting your man with a slug like Janie(?)
We hangin' out up north with Slim Shady
We hangin' out down south with Lil' Wayne
East coast raised me, west coast pays me
This is Hip-Hop, them critics don't phase me
KRS, I know it sounds crazy, but I do this for the (love, baby)

Boogie Down (love, baby)
Productions (love, baby)
(love, baby)

[KRS-One]
Haha, wha' ya call that?
Boogie Down, Boogie Down, Boogie Down, Boogie Down Productions

You ha fe understand your situation
You create your life through your imagination
Anything you think is a manifestation
Of who you are - you're creation!
Can't you understand?
Everytime you think in bad mind
You attract that to you same time!
Listen ????
Refine, expand your mind
Consciousness go through all space and time!

Look at ?????
We teach the philosophy
Deal with no hypocrisy
The sun is there on top of me
Beaming down that vitamin E
Feelin sick we're not gonna be
Kris in jail you're not gonna see
Take my shots on the ?????
We get you jumpin around
We the number one sound
You want  ????
??????

I'm flippin' the sound, flippin' the flow
Some say I'm stuck back in '84, I don't know
I don't see no nickel bags, yo
I don't see no Word Up mag, yo
All I see is straight up fags, yo
These rappers they brag, though
Til we in the club, not in they castle
Somewhere in El Paso, Texas
That's when Kris gets reckless
Goes down the checklist
You rappers best respect this
It's better you listen to this metaphysician
While people bling and glisten I seek that higher vision

Don't get so high, til you can't see past your eye
Enjoy yourself but don't die
Listen now, listen now, why why?
Why you want to be like a fly guy?
Don't get so high, til you can't see past your eye
Enjoy yourself but don't die
Tell me now, why you ha fe be such a fly guy?
Temple of HipHop and me
We step in any party - top celebrity
See when we come in a dance we never look for grammy
'Cause that's 'cause we got r-e-s-p-e-c-t
I want just one wife - S-i-m-o-n-e
She said she always want fe marry an Emcee
Travel 'round the world and live a life so free
Then she met me - H-i-p-H-o-p
Started countin' up twenty, thirty, forty G
Started gettin' fresh garments now for free
Dealin' with promoters and countin' the money
Takin' trips to Europe on the Queen Mary

What do you see?
You ha fe direct your chi
You must live your life properly
What do you see?
You have to be what you see
You have got to live your life free
What do you see?
You ha fe direct your chi
You must live your life properly
What do you see?
You have to BE what you see
So you can see yourself living free

[KRS-One]
Yeah, Kool Herc!
Kool Herc, this goes out to you
KRS-One, word up, look

Temple of Hip-Hop, non-stop, we rockin you
This is what them b-boys be poppin and lockin to
Head moves, windmills, and yes uprockin to
From Mr. Wiggles, Boogaloo Shrimp, and Shabba Doo
Uh-oh, time for the truth to start boppin through
Stompin through, with somethin new man, we shockin you
This is what hip-hop'll do, perform the impossible
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody OOOH
I'm philosophical, logical, very topical
These rappers man startin to look comical
But I'mma do what I'mma do and never follow
I'ma do, Amadou, even if it leads to Diallo
Victory over the streets that's our motto
Some gotta work for it, others hit the lotto
But big up Luna, Empire, Beedo and Gato
Watch how I spit fire, it's been a long time yo
But really it's a short time, cause I'm already in 2020
Me and Herc yellin MAKE MONEY MONEY MONEY
Hear me sonny while it's sunny release your rhyme
Get your money, ain't nuttin funny, but get peace of mind

[Intro]
Bam Beatz on this one, let's rock out!
Taking you low...

[Verse one]
This The Teacha, I do this for life
Plus I'm psychic, but I ain't gon tell you who's doing your wife
You ain't raw like the coke in your rhyme recital
You been cut so much, you starting to look suicidal
You trifle, trifling, you need to stop and listen
You need to hear 2Pac when he was locked in prison
Man, for real, I'm expanding
This ain't whiling out, you'll get nicked with two cannons
Your team's not loyal, you're not harming me son
If I said "Who wanna go on tour?" you'd be an army of one
What's that shit around your mouth man, cum?!
Face the fact, you lost, we got it, we won
You better off trying on some lottery run
Then to go against The Teacha, I put the Glock to you dunn
I be rockin' them drums, all you doing is shoutin'
What's your address, 69 Brokeback Mountain?!
It seems my skill you doubtin'
I spit lyrics, I flow like a fountain
Listen, you'll get crushed like a kush going into my blunt
I take it way back, all you do is front!

[Interlude]
Yeah... haha, ha...
Yeah, yeah... KRS!

[Verse two]
Spit-tacular, you spit at me, I spit it back at ya
I'm an emcee, not an actor
My lyrics won't trap ya, they'll free ya
But rappers still wanna test The Teacha, let 'em have it!
What you in my face for, in my space for?
This is what you rappers get smacked in your face for
Y'all talk about cutting the bass raw
But you draw the cops, this what you get chased for
I'm forever above your world in whatever you do
Rappers, I will level your crew
When I'm through, they won't even be able to TELL if it's you
I'm an emcee, this tradition goes back to Pebbly Poo
Man, I speak the truth, I'mma show you what God is
I heard your CD; from the start, it was GARBAGE!
Click, click, click, I load the cartridge
Look in the palm of my hand man -- THAT'S where your heart is!

[MM Lyte]
Money - M-o-n-e-y
(Money!)
Money - M-o-n-e-y
(Money!)

[KRS-One]
M-o-n-e-y, what you need to just get by
Money, honey, ain't it funny?
Money, people wanna die
It seems without money, people cry, people will lie
You cannot deny, without money you can't apply
For anything that catches your eye, I wonder why
The root of all evil, let me teach you, now who am I?
The Emcee, teachin' my people "Don't live that lie"
You got to get money, but don't let money get you, guy

I can break it down like whatever you want
Whatever you spend your money on strong, yo that's what you flaunt
Spend your money on these honeys, yo if that's what you want
Spend your money on attorneys if you're goin' to court
If I look around your neck I can see what you bought
What, you think you get respect? No, you takin' a short
Yo, you need the money, of course, you need it to live
(Yo, what you put your money on, Kris?) Yo, right on my kids

[MC LYte]
M-o-n-e-y, don't ask why. It IS the root of all evil
Though very necessary to your livelihood
It's all good when you got enough
Til enough ain't enough and you hit upon rough times
You make your money and I'll make mine
(Yo, we need the...) (Money!)

[KRS-One]
Don't get me wrong, mistakin' this song
Like money is not important - yes, it is, just be strong
It's the reason for the thievin' and that war goin'on
It's the reason that you seein' all these girls in their thong
It's the reason that the radio's on
It's the reason that you believe if you gotta work from sun-up 'til dawn
It's the cravings that connect you to that money you makin'
Your desire is the fire got you feelin' you slavin'

(Free yourself!) Money doesn't make you the man
(Be yourself!) A man gets his money in credit(?)

Ok, I'ma get this money, really, all day
But not to the point where Im goin' the wrong way
I'ma put my money down on rides and all that
Hook up the house so me and my spouse can fall back
Investing my knowledge way beyond college
Write books and fly hooks in my cottage
Cheese - Kris bling-blingin'? Yo, please!
Money is an energy that gets what I need
I can understand them cats that rap flossin' and frontin'
It's all good, they from the hood, never had nothin'
They just got they money and everything's sunny
Hear what I'm saying, they preyin', boy, and lookin for bunnies

[MC Lyte]
Did we floss what we bought
Forgetting that sharing is what we've been taught?
Cause this here gettin' money is an individual sport
Money can get me in to the same place where years ago
My bros and sisters with black skin
Were confined to the back door and the kitchen

[KRS-One]
Last verse, where your cash purse
Reach into your wallet, nothin' alloted, that hurts
Breath stinkin' you're thinkin', but can't afford Certs
Need the dollar and baby hollerin' - no work
I don't know how you gonna get the dough
You could become educated, you could become a ho
You could do both, that's like puttin' butter on toast
The bread is the knowledge, butter is what gets you that close

[MC Lyte]
Money is funny - how a piece of paper can make or break your very existence
Quick as it come, quick as it go - you better know about the ebb and the flow
You get money in droves, trick it on cars and blow
Throw dollars at black queens cause, for the dough they'll strip their clothes
And for the right amount of money
A king will pimp his queen into being a ho on a stroll
Life will always be hard when you choose to make money your god

[Intro]
Buck buck buck-buck-buck, buck-buck buck buck!
All rude bwoy lissen up!

[Verse 1]
Black cop!! Black cop, black cop, black cop
Stop shootin black people, we all gonna drop
You don't even get, paid a whole lot
So take your M-60 and put it 'pon lock!
Take your four-five and you put it 'pon lock!
Lookin for your people when you walk down a block
Here in America you have drug spot
They get the black cop, to watch the drug spot
The black drug dealer just avoid black cop
They're killin each other on a East Coast block
Killin each other on a West Coast block
White police, don't give a care about dat
Dem want us killin each other over crack
Anyway you put it, it's a black on BLACK
Black cop, black cop, black cop
Black cop, black cop, black cop
Thirty years ago, there were no black cops
You couldn't even run, drive 'round the block
Recently police trained black cop
To stand on the corner, and take gunshot
This type of warfare isn't new or a shock
It's black on black crime again nonstop
Black cop!! Black cop black cop
Black cop black cop black cop

[Bridge]
"Don't be the sucker..
Don't be the sucker comin into my face..
Don't be the sucker.."

[Verse 2]
Here's what the West and the East have in common
Both have black cops in cars profilin
Hardcore kids in the West got stress
In the East we are chased by the same black beast
The black cop is the only real obstacle
Black slave turned black cop is not logical
But very psychological, haven't you heard?
It's the BLACK COP killin black kids in Johannesburg
Whassup black cop, yo, whassup?!
Your authorization says shoot your nation
You wanna uphold the law, what could you do to me?
The same law dissed the whole black community
You can't play both sides of the fence
1993 mad kids are gettin tense
Black cop!! Black cop black cop black cop
Stop shootin black people we all gonna drop
You don't even get, paid a whole lot
Take your four-five and you put it 'pon lock!
Take your M-60 and put it 'pon lock!
Take your uzi, put it 'pon lock!
Black cop black cop black cop
Black cop black cop black cop

[Outro]
"Don't be the sucker..
Don't be the sucker..
Don't be the sucker..
Don't be the sucker comin into my face
Don't.. don't be the sucker comin into my face
Don't-don't-don't be the sucker comin into my face
Don't-don't-don't-don't
Don't be the sucker comin into my face
Don't-don't, don't-don't
Don't be the sucker comin into my face
Don't-don't-don't!
Don't be the sucker comin into my face with that yang-yang!"

[Intro]
"Yo stop frontin', and use your head"

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
Bo! Boom bye bye, hip-hop will never die
Despite the fact that I'm fly I'm never dry
You could beat me, cheat me, when you meet me try to defeat me
But nevertheless you'll have stress, 'cause I don't rest
You wanna know what my problem is, if you're curious??
I take this hip-hop shit too serious
I forget that other rappers ain't true to this
So when they grab the mic, I get hyped like LET'S DO THIS!!
All my rhymes are fat, while rappers are skimpy, wimpy
So I simply chew they crew like a Blimpie
Skip me when you dissin, skip me when you on a ego mission
I blow up, like nitroglycerin!
You better tune in to Teddy Ted

[Bridge]
"Yo stop frontin', and use your head"

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
Well if you ain't called it hip-hop, there's a door, I ain't stoppin
I got more flavors than Baskin Robbins!
I flash the funky fresh flavors force-fully
Freak the phonies and flip philosophy constantly (true!)
That reminds me, rappers rock drip-drop
Not hip-hop, they wanna SING and all dem ting
Thank God KRS is still rappin, all that "ooh I love you baby"
And "blink blink blink", this ain't happenin

[Verse 3: Kid Capri]
Yo Kris, there's curtains for these rappers that be frontin on the next man
Lookin down at brothers just because they gettin checks and
Haven't got a skill but they're LARGE on the hum-bum
You wanna step to Kid Capri, COME COME COME!!
I break em up, just for actin like a superstar
Around the way, we got a neighborhood trooper car
We ride by, and spray your crew, and your honies too
And rip you open and drink your blood like a Mountain Dew

[Verse 4: KRS-One]
I descend I lend a friend a helping hand
To stop a trend, again and again and again, I just can't say when
I beg to confess my sins to other men
Reverends guard lips, within there I'll begin
I'll always win, oversaken
The party is ripped, without a hit or with a hit I'm rippin shit
You must admit, I'll never quit the lyrics I flip
I'm tough like licorice, battlin Kid Capri? It's ridiculous
We come to the party inconspicuous

[Outro]
"Yo stop frontin', and use your head"

[Intro: Kid Capri & KRS-One]
Aiyyo Kris, yo yo yo!
That was fresh, come with that next shit
Uhh! Fat fat fat fat beats!
How refreshing is it really?
How refreshing is it really?!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Whoo!
Big shout out to Philly in the house
G. Simone, you know you're not alone
KRS-One on the microphone
Now we gonna come down ruffneck like this now seen?
Mad Lion hold tight

[Chorus: KRS-One]
Brown skin woman, you a queen, not a HOE
Any man that drop the lyric what we give them the BO
Brown skin woman, you a queen and not a HOE
Any man that drop the lyric what we give them the BO

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
We don't come with disrespect, we come with intellect
If you come with disrespect you get a rope around your neck
Some people don't expect me to be so violent
But me NAH violent, just myself I protect
Too many time I see, young gwal pickadee
Pay five ten twenty thirty dollar to see
Some rapper some singer some...celebrity
Talk bout they wan fi sex up and fill up you body
But them NAH talk about peelin off some money
For the pumpin onna bed, when you haf the baby
Whattaya think can happen next? After you're done havin sex?
Too much of ignorance, not enough intellence
Mahn me NOT against sex, but too many DJ
Talk sex but them not talk about the next day
'Cause the next day them gone, and you sit alone
Got em soup up your mic, pon de microphone

[Chorus: KRS-One]
Brown skin woman, you a queen, not a HOE
Any man that drop the lyric what we give them the BO
Brown skin woman, you a queen and not a HOE
Any man that drop the lyric what we give them the BO

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
Brown skin gwal them can't diss yo
'Cause you run the show-ow-ow!
Them call you all type of bimbo
But you know you're not a ho-oe-oe!
Bwoy pickade, check out your history
Brown man is a God in any ci-ty
White, man knew dat, and dat was a shock
So dem whip up your bod', and dem whippin not stop
But dem NAH can't stop us wit de whip and de chain
So dem take away your history, erase your name
STILL, with no name, with no fight, with no fuss
We just, take on the name, that MASSA give us
That name is N-GGA, the correct is NEGRO
It's Spanish for BLACK, white mahn call us DAT
There is also NEGROID, also NEGRO
Now, all nigga pon the corner playin cee-lo
Man you're not a negro, cause you're skin is not black
Take a look at yourself, you're brown and that's a fact
You not jump from no tree, you not live in no cave
That's some GARBAGE dem print, dem want you to behave!
You a African man, some say Asian
You must respect your love, all brown skin 'oman!
If you diss your 'oman, you not come wit no plan
So shut up your mowf, til you must understand!

[Chorus: KRS-One]
Brown skin woman, you a queen, not a HOE
Any man that drop the lyric what we give them the BO
Brown skin woman, you a queen and not a HOE
Any man that drop the lyric what we give them the BO

[Outro: KRS-One & Kid Capri]
I know you want me to call you a nigga...NO!
I know you want me to call you a ho...NO!
I know you want me to call you a bitch...NO!
This is how it go!
Yes Kris, you're large!
Another fat production by the KIIIIID Capri
Big shouts to the engineer Naughty
Big shouts to Luca, and we OUTTTTTTTTA here!

[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Verse 1: KRS-ONE]
After seven years of rockin', how do you rate me?
Poorly or greatly? Everybody seems to be goin' for theirs lately
Yo mad heads be needin' money
So listen very close as I conduct this little study
See it's, funny to me, you can watch TV
And give up your life trying to be all you can be in the Army
Not knowin' your history, you either fight and die or come back home in misery
Yo get with me, I deal with reality
Loosen your mind to the truth, and don't get mad at me
No politician can give you peace
If you trust Jesus, why do you vote for a beast?
Emancipation is long over due
So overcome procrastination
Because freedom is within you
For some reason we think we're free
So we'll never be, because we haven't recognized slavery
You're still a slave, look at how you behave
Debatin' on where and when and how and what master gave
You wanna know how we screwed up from the beginning?
We accepted our oppressor's religion
So in the case of slavery it ain't hard
Because it's right in the eyes of THEIR God
Where is our God: the God that represents us?
The God that looks like me, the God that I can trust?
A God of peace and love, not mass hysteria?
I don't want a God that blesses America
I could never really vote for the devil
Let me take you to a higher level

[Verse 2: KRS-ONE]
Title, take the title from the Bible we can get there
Rip the title from off the front of the Bible, God don't live there
Too many inconsistencies, too many mysteries
Picture the Pope and the Vatican, laughing and drinking and singing and kissing me
I stand with God whether I'm paid or whether I'm cryin' broke
I like to ask these politicians would Jesus vote?
The way we view God is a freakin' shame
Church is to blame. We trust God, but bomb Hussein
We simply lovin' the scripture, same scripture that whipped 'cha
Sooner it'll hit 'cha, religion's gettin' richer
With that European version of Christ made into a picture
Our society's gettin' sicker, and sicker, and sicker...
Like liquor, we are God-intoxicated
Not to the true God, but the one the government created
The same governments tellin' people to vote
I pray to God because the people have lost hope
You either vote for the mumps or the measles
Whether you vote for the lesser of two evils, you vote for evil
Politics and God are not equal
But the education, if you don't guard, is really lethal
People have more respect for a holy book
Than they do for a cow on a meat hook
Believers of Jesus be denouncing Satan on every level
But every Halloween they're dressin' like devils
I pray to you for the light you might give them
Mother make them know that you're livin' within them
You begin them and end them in silence
Frankly, if they knew you, they would understand violence
I pray to you for the Pope and the Vatican
Have mercy Mother, 'cause I know that you're mad at them
The White Jesus deceived us awhile ago
And Pope Julius the Second paid Michelangelo
I know this happened in 1519 yet
This is the image we can't seem to forget
Vote for God, don't vote for the Devil
Let me take you to a higher level
Praise God
YES, I have danced with the devil
- and I learned all the steps!
You watched me God, and inside you wept
You reached out for my hand - I turned my back on you
I thought I knew the plan; but that's not true
I've learned who I was, and I know now who I am
Meet me on the dancefloor God, for you.. I will stand

[KRS-One]
Off beat, what you know about it?
All heat, all street, my dough I be about it
I eat all week, I don't need to shout it
I'm legendary, in many books you can read about it
Well I'm back to let you cats know that
I'm not asleep, I heard your mixtape raps
What, you think I'm weak like one of these old school cats?
You better hear me speak before you get holes in your back

Ain't nothing here sweet except your whole damn pack
Why I gotta return? Cause y'all's so damn wack wack
You never will learn. That's why the teacha's back
Now you gon' feel that real golden age rap

Unfolding the gat
This ain't no place for no amateur block rap
Rappin' about your hammer is cocked back
That means you fuckin' with a six-shooter
And we got big guns that can stop that
All you hear is klug-clack-klug, klug-clack-klug
And you and your man y'all fall backward
Y'all ain't nothin' but actors, bitin' like Dracula
Kris spit spitacular

[Hook] - 2x
To my block - I got you
From the bottom to the top - I got you
When you need that raw HipHop - I got you
I mean that '94 HipHop - I got you
If you ain't got nowhere to go - I got you
VIP passes to my show - I got you
Come to my crib, let's take it slow - I got you
Never forget, you gotta know that - I got you

[KRS-One]
You listenin' to the depth of the heat
I'm omni-hood, that means I rep' every street
When I come around cats get up and eat
On the mic I won't let up 'til the end of the beat

I stay tight when I recite and sendin' you heat
Let's compare, what's your agenda this week?
Me? I be chillin' out in sacred buildings with my children
Free as a fly on the ceiling

[Hook]- 2x

[Intro]
Boom bap, original Rap
Boom bap, original Rap
See how it sounds (bo!) a little unrational (bo!)
See how it sounds (bo!) a little unrational (bo!)
See how it sounds (bo!) a little unrational (bo!)
See how it sounds (bo!) a little unrational (bo!)

[Verse 1]
Now bad boy squad and bad boy crew
Everything I do, I do just for you
Another silly sucker wants the champion belt
But like a microwave, these days I make em melt
Return Of The Boom Bap means just that
It means return of the real hard beats and real rap
The ladies in the place like it just like that
I'm a around the way guy with a baseball cap
You know my style, you know my name
I'm chillin' at the top, but I'm still the same
I never crossed over, never went pop
You know KRS will give you real hip-hop, so...

[Hook]
See how it sounds (bo!) a little unrational (bo!)
See how it sounds (bo!) a little unrational (bo!)
See how it sounds (bo!) a little unrational (bo!)
See how it sounds (bo!) a little unrational (bo!)

[Verse 2]
People always callin me a top celebrity
'Cause when I'm on the mic
I like to speak freely
You hear me chattin' lyric but I'm not an MC
A one poetic member of the crew B.D.P
I looked around the nation but I simply couldn't find
Another entertainer with a rhyme like mine
I pick up the mic and I tear up the phone
At this point in the party, I should be left alone
But uh-oh uh-oh I've come to show
A brand new flow, is the flow wack? NO!
Listen to the pro, come to the show in a b-boy stance
Bogle in the dance
Bogle and a bogle and a bogle in the party
Here's a little stylee, come an wake up everybody
Boom bap, original rap
Boom bap, boom bap, original rap
Refreshin' when you hear it
Hard rap is all that, so...

[Hook]
See how it sounds a little unrational
See how it sounds a little unrational
See how it sounds a little unrational
See how it sounds a little unrational
See how it sounds (bo!) a little unrational (bo!)
See how it sounds (bo!) a little unrational (bo!)
See how it sounds (bo!) a little unrational (bo!)
See how it sounds (bo!) a little unrational (bo!)

[Verse 3]
Bogle in the dance, bogle in the dance
Bogle in a, bogle in a, bogle in the party
Bogle in the dance, bogle in the dance
Bogle in a, bogle in a, bogle in the party
On and on to the PM Dawn
I buck two shots and you squad is gone
You add a little street in your r-a-p
But never do you wanna challenge B.D.P
'Cause smashin' up a crew, one-two is the least
When a sucka wants to battle that just gets me geesed
I never backed down from to an MC feud
Never on stage KRS got booed
Stayed hardcore never changed my attitude
I got the hip-hop juice for the hip-hop food
I eat when I drink, an I drink when I eat
When I speak what I speak, what I speak is not weak
Now Boogie-down, boogie down, boogie down produc
With the buck buck buck buck buck buck BUCK!
Throw ya hands high in the sky
Wave em around, 'cause I get down
Down to the nitty, to the nitty, to the gritty
Peace to all the hardcore kids in the city so

[Hook]
See how it sounds a little unrational
See how it sounds a little unrational
See how it sounds a little unrational
See how it sounds a little unrational
See how it sounds (bo!) a little unrational (bo!)
See how it sounds (bo!) a little unrational (bo!)
See how it sounds (bo!) a little unrational (bo!)
See how it sounds (bo!) a little unrational (bo!)

[Outro]
Fresh for 1993, you SUCKAS

[Intro]
Buck-buck-buck-buck booyakasha!
Of course all the hardcore heads
This one goes out to you
Crank up the volume one time
Peace to all the real DJs out there
'Cause I don't send my music to no garbage DJs
They get me (Mad)
So in the clubs, I get (Mad)
On the mic, I get (Mad)
On the beats, I get (Mad)

[Chorus]
Yo, I got the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)
I'm with the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)
I be chillin' with the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)
I'm rollin' with the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)
Come on

[Verse 1]
See, this is what I'm sayin' and I know you don't see this
Whack, underprivileged MCs think they can see Kris
They watchin' too much television and they rocka
This ain't the TV show "Taxi," and I ain't Latka
I'll break an MC off proper, yo, don't check me
Ask your moms and pops, yo, they respect me
But here you stand, tryin' to get yours, but gettin' nothin'
You probably can't spell "Boogie Down" or "Production"
I play for Jeeps, I play for keeps, I play for streets, believe me
Put down the microphone and consider a squeegee
You're rated PG
Again, I win when I begin
I'm slammin' again, no end
Tryin' to comprehend, I don't bend
I ravage and damage
I'm wild like a savage
I'm kickin' asses
Hot flashes
Your style is with trashes
Stay out of my classes, punk
Stay out of my classes

[Chorus]
Yo, I got the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)
I'm chillin' with the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)
I'm rollin' with the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)
And I be hangin' with the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)
Come on

[Interlude]
Is the Bronx in the house?
I said, is the Bronx in the house?
Fuck that shit
Is Uptown in the house?

[Verse 2]
Twinkle, twinkle to the little rap star
I got all type of MC tongue in a pickle jar
So here's a quick freestyle to my target
My core audience, fuck the rest of the market
'Cause I spark it, styles, I loan shark it
Then break your legs if you try to chart it
I got heart, it
Doesn't take a lot to rock a record, get with it
Some MCs can't rock for five minutes
Sorry
That's not the way to approach me
Use caution
I rip up lyrical crews and MCs often
You probably don't know this
I give birth to MCs
And I also give abortions
I'll do a number to your body structure
You look like supper
And I'm that hungry motherfucker
You don't wanna be on the menu
I'll end you
Twist you up and bend you like Gestapo
Pick up the microphone and crush up MC like a taco
No, we're never sad because we nah deal with sorrow
That's why dem challenge me, jah man, you know dem challenge trouble
Me are number one, of me, there is no double
And you don't want no trouble
'Cause Blastmaster KRS is flashin' lyrics on the double

[Chorus]
I got the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)
I'm chillin' with the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)
I'm rollin' with the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)
I'm hangin' with the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)
And I be comin' with the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)

[Interlude]
Word up
Yo, Brooklyn, where you at? Where you at?
Yo, Brooklyn, where you at, Brooklyn?
Where you at?
Yo, Bronx, make some noise

[Verse 3]
Check
Me comin' in quick, me comin' a dance, now me a sing
KRS-One in a party, man, me do me own ting
Nuff MC test, but you don't hear vowel one
All you hear is when the BDP crew slap them up
We have the champion belt and lyrical cup
Any DJ that want my title filled, no way the man step up
But when you lose, now understand you get fucked up
This ain't no game upon the mic, me bring the noise to you like Chuck

[Chorus]
I got the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)
I'm chillin' with the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)
And I be comin' with the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)
I'm rollin' with the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)
Kid Capri got the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)
Gang Starr got the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)
Ill Will got the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)
Flavor Unit got the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)
Check it out

[Outro]
Make some noise
Bronx is ruling
Fuck that shit
Bronx is in the motherfuckin' house
Big shout out to all the real hip-hoppers in the house
And all the phony DJs that tried to battle BDP this year
Understand
I got the (Mad, mad crew up in the house)

[Intro]
You never will conquer the champion, ooh-wee-ooh
You never will conquer the champion, come down, my selecta
Adjust that treble right now, adjust the bass
Turn it up, stop frontin', c'mon, turn it up
Alright, check it out, '93 lyrics, here we go

[Chorus]
I never want a Jheri curl up under my hat
The woman in my bed has got to be strictly Black
I never want money if my lyrics are wack
So I must rock the mic
I play only the reggae and I play only rap
I rock the African, the European, and Jap-
​anese, I got to show you that I am all that
So I must rock the mic

[Verse 1]
Are you tired of lyrical liars, passing fliers
Wannabe emcees, but really good triers
Tripping over mic cords, getting you bored?
A total fraud, this kind of thing I can't afford, so I
Pick up the mic and kill it, ill it, top bill it
The club is a skillet where emcees get fried in it
You got beef, chill it, blood, I spill it
After seven long years of ripping the party and I'm still with it
You call my name, I don't think about suing ya
I come to the club with that booyaka
Laughin' while I'm doin' ya, the crowd is booin' ya
Gimme one month, record for record or tape, I'll ruin ya
Some likkle old pon sound bwoy wan fi rule de city
His style is lookin' pretty, beats and rhymes are dibby-dibby
Here comes the root-ical radical teacha
I'll eat ya, defeat ya, beat ya 'til ya stagger and ya teeth chatter
You'll be goin' through convulsions as I flash data
Any rapper can be a decapitated rapper, now what's the matter?
You're full of more junk than a sausage
Let me show you what a real hip-hop artist is

[Pre-Chorus]
My posse from the Bronx is thick
My posse from the Bronx is thick
My posse from the Bronx is thick
My posse from the Bronx is thick

[Chorus]
I never want a Jheri curl up under my hat
The woman in my bed has got to be strictly Black
I never want money if my lyrics are wack
So I must rock the mic
I play only the reggae and I play only rap
I rock the African, the European, and Jap-
​anese, I got to show you that I am all that
So I must rock the mic

[Verse 2]
Of course, yeah, I'm the most brilliant recording artist in your life
Never have to repeat a rhyme style twice, precise
In a lyrical drought like water to your lips, oh yes, my lyrics will suffice
I'm nice, like beans and rice, I am delicious
Who's the freshest lyricist on the mic, you don't want to fuck with? Kris is
Lyric for lyric, rhyme for rhyme, style for style I break you like dishes
Either you come fully correct or the lyrics you simply makin' wishes
We got no time for fake Black leaders and dreamers blowin' wishes
You's a fraud, I mean a fraud like in fraudulation
I know what it is, the crown of rhyme supremacy you're tastin'
And, yes, before the flavor hits your greedy tongue
You get ripped up by KRS-One, now
Lyrics? Somebody want lyrics from the lyrical terrorist?
Here's a little somethin' for you all to remember Kris
And remember this
I am no pessimist, more of an optimist
Activist revolutionist, yes, the hardest artist
And the smartest, Premier, spark this

[Pre-Chorus]
My posse from the Bronx is thick
My posse from the Bronx is thick
My posse from the Bronx is thick
My posse from the Bronx is thick

[Chorus]
I never want a Jheri curl up under my hat
The woman in my bed has got to be strictly Black
I never want money if my lyrics are wack
So I must rock the mic
I play only the reggae and I play only rap
I rock the African, the European, and Jap-
​anese, I got to show you that I am all that
So I must rock the mic

[Intro]
Awww yeah! All ruffneck rudebwoy hold tight
Just a little somethin for the Jeep
Turn my voice up a little bit and let's get this started
Comin to you live and direct from the 1986 version
Comin up to 1993
Of course, Premier on the beat
Now check it out

[Hook]
The girlies is FREEE-EEE
'Cause the crack cost money, oh yeah!
I said the girlies is FREEE-EEE
'Cause the crack cost money, oh yeah!

[Verse 1]
Ridin one day in a '92 Beamer
After seven years I seen Denise she still a skeezer
But look what she did, she went and had a kid, no dad
And just released her ass out the rehab
You think she'd act like she don't know
She's still a ho, but umm check my man for the show
"Hiiiii, DJ K-R-S"
She tried to shake her butt, I rolled my window up!
She got pissed and said, "You ain't all that!"
And went and got some other girl schemin for crack
In my car, I couldn't hear what they spoke about
I hit the accelerator and I was out!
I never check my man but I knew the plan
Come to the jam MCs in there be thinkin they Superman
Sure enough, the place is packed with no breeze
Crazy girls and wall to wall MCs
I'm like a cat these MCs are Fancy Feast
I'm thinkin of rhymes but I'm interrupted by Denise
She said, "Kris I really need a favor honey
My girlfriend here really needs some quick money!"
I looked at her girlfriend and her girlfriend was fly
But I ain't stupid, she had that look in her eye
I touched her back, she said, "Denise has he got the crack?
Is he the one? I gotta run back and feed my son"
I said, "How old is your son?" She said, "Three months"
I walked away but my man cold bust her fronts
So she pulled out a gun and shot him in the party
Except for the MCs, I knew EVERYBODY
She tried to let off a shot, one more time
But got stomped so bad, she turned to wine
No one could find Denise for several weeks
You know the time, on this '93 beat

[Hook]
The girlies is FREEE-EEE
'Cause the crack cost money, oh yeah!
I said the girlies is FREEE-EEE
'Cause the crack cost money, oh yeah!

[Verse 2]
I knew a group that had a dope lead singer
Swinger, single guy, that knew his style was fly
After the show he was tired sweaty and kinda sloppy
But of course, a million girls are in the lobby!
He saw a group of girls hangin out and lookin good
So he took one to his room because he knew he could
Inside the room he said, "Make love to me and never stop"
She said, "Sure, but how's about a crack rock?"
I knew my man down the hall had it all
So he called, down the hall, but homeboy wasn't there at all
He turned to the girl and said, "My man ain't there"
So she let down her hair, unzipped his pants down right there
Oral sex in effect, or rather deep throat
But just before he came she bit his dick and slit his throat
As he fell back dizzy, he began to choke
She took his wallet and said, "You ain't broke!"

[Hook]
The girlies is FREEE-EEE
'Cause the crack cost money, oh yeah!
I said the girlies is FREEE-EEE
'Cause the crack cost money, oh yeah!

[Bridge]

[Outro]
{*DJ Premier cuts n scratches*} "Boogie Down Productions"

[Intro]
"Boogie Down was performing, hey they ain't no joke"
"Down with the sound called B-D-P"

[Verse 1: KRS-ONE]
Back in the days I knew rap would never die
I used to listen to Awesome-2 on WHBI
I used to hear all kind of rap groups before sampling loops
Rappers wore bell-bottom Lee suits
Me and Kenny couldn't afford that
So we would go to the park when they was jammin' to hear rap
I used to listen till the cops broke it up
I always thought to myself "Damn, why they fucked it up?"
But nevertheless I was in love with the microphone
And it stayed that way until I left home
On the streets of New York, now I'm free
But with freedom comes big responsibility
I used to walk around driven by the force
I remember how large Super Rhymes was when he fell off
I used to wonder about crews that used to rock
They were large, but none of them could manage to stay on top

[Bridge: KRS-ONE]
Do you ever think about when you outta here?
Record deal and video outta here?
Mercedes Benz and Range Rover outta here?
No doubt BDP is old school, but we ain't goin' out!

[Verse 2: KRS-ONE]
After livin' on the streets alone
Some years went by, I signed myself into a group home
I used to watch the show "I Dream of Jeannie"
And dreamt about "When will I be large like Whodini?"
But I was messin' with graffiti on the subway
And gettin' chased by the cops almost everyday
I knew it had to be a better way, see
So I would go to my room, blast RUN DMC
Around 1984 I left the group home, again alone
Still dreamin' about the microphone
Gimme a chance man, I know I can rock it
But I had to worry about puttin' money in my pocket
So when I reached the shelter I met my helper DJ Scott La Rock
And we both loved hip-hop
I was takin' suckas out in the shelter system
Yeah there was rappers in the shelter but I had to diss 'em
But all along, my vision was never lost
I kept seeing all these rap groups fallin' off

[Bridge: KRS-ONE]
Do you ever think about when you're outta here?
Fly girl and fresh gear outta here?
Five-thousand dollar love seat outta here?
No doubt BDP is old school, but we ain't goin' out!

[Verse 3: KRS-ONE]
While I'm battling these rival crews
Yes, BDP would stay in the Street News
Some said, All they wanna do is battle
They can't write a song, so their careers won't last long!
Around this time I used to hang with Ced Gee
And DJ Scott La Rock used to buy gold with Eric B
I didn't meet Rakim till later with Scott
I remember we were jammin' at the rooftop
It used to irk me when these critics had opinions
Scott would say "Just keep rappin', I'll keep spinnin'"
We had a fucked up contract, but we signed it
And dropped the hip-hop album Criminal Minded
We told the critics your opinions are bull
Same time Eric B and Rakim dropped Paid in Full
Hip-hop pioneers we didn't ask to be
But right then hip-hop changed drastically
People didn't wanna hear the old rap sound
We started samplin' beats by James Brown
In the middle of doin' "My Philosophy"
Scott was killed and that shit got to me
But knowin' the laws of life and death
I knew his breath, was one with my breath
I had nothin' left and it was scary
So I dropped By All Means Necessary
Another hip-hop group that was a friend of me
Was a revolution crew called Public Enemy
It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back
These two albums set off consciousness in rap
But all along, I'm still lookin' around
And all I can see are these rap groups fallin' down

[Outro]
Do you ever think about when you outta here?
Condominium and beach house outta here?
Credit cards and bank accounts outta here?
No doubt BDP is old school, be we ain't goin' out!

[Intro: D.J. Premier & KRS-One]
Tellin' it like it is, right about now D.J. Premier is in the
Motherfuckin' house and shit, ya know what I'm sayin'? But yo
Yo Kris, run that shit, ya know what I'm sayin'? That, that shit
My joint. Run that motherfucker...it's only right kid...
(Do it, do it, do it...)
Drop that bassline...
You want lyrics? We give ya lyrics. Check it out now, one time...
(Do it, do it, do it...)

[Hook: KRS-One]
When we come in all de dance 'nuff D.J.'s shut up, woy!
Gal! Will ya come slap dem up
When we come in all de dance 'nuff D.J.'s shut up, woy!
Ill Will, slap dem up

[Verse 1: Ill Will]
MC's get ate, get broken like a pretzel
And get dissed if they ever try to step to
They can't take a MC with loose lips
Talk a lotta shit but sink no motherfuckin' ships
Lyrics make bigger holes than hollow tips
Watch another rapper body get stiff
Just like in church, we pass the basket
As I preach over his casket
Fuck it, kick the body right over
And say "See ya, hmm...nice to know ya"
Got another rapper to see
Yo Kris, bust that ass

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
Certainly
Either shit or get off the pot
Let the original rapper rock the spot
You stand there and jock, goin' *mumbles*
This is absolutely ludicrous, what can you do to KRS
Chattin' foolishness, step along quick with that stupidness
It's me reppin' this for self, where else ya lookin'?
I got more rhymes than all the Jamaicans in Brooklyn
So beat it or be seated, G, I'm mad undefeated
Young boy, you can't see me, run along and make pee-pee
I was rockin' rhymes when "La-Di-Da-Di" was a demo
Admit you been on my tip for years and just can't seem to let go
Go, go call your mother, tell her you wanna battle KRS quick
I bet the minute you get home you'll get your ass whipped
Crazy ill mad styles is what I give 'em
Not a run-of-the-mill'em, I drill 'em, I got ridiculous rhythm
None of my styles you can get with'em
Still um, will um, your crew come get some so I can kill'em

[Verse 3: Ill Will]
Well I roll by myself but don't let it fool ya
If I got beef my crew'll damn step to ya
We don't play no games, I'll come straight to your rest
Lift up your shirt and blast you in your chest

[Verse 4: KRS-One]
Well that was fresh
A fad doesn't fill the bill, but mad skills will
Don't let me have to kill you kid, god forbid still
Greed will lead your need to succeed
But your speed, your speech
Your outreach is a breach of what I teach
For lyrical styles, you're a leech
If I was Spanish I'd say, "You rhyme like a beech"
Wow-wow-wow-wow, wow-wow-wow, wow-wow-wow...
Wow, for a amateur you really looked hard
But you're really a bitch, when you get it together
Call me, here's my card
Check the list: you lack breath control, mental behavior
Lyrical talent, imagination, and flavor
I got no time for amateur rhyme, you could be hurt
Thinkin' you're hard because you wear a gangsta T-Shirt
I'll smash your wannabe ass in the deep dirt
Black, you'll come up dizzy sayin' "How da fuck he do dat?"
'Cause you're yappin' like you can't be reached
If your name ain't Arrested Development, well save your speech
Time to ill, I got mad skills to fill
Not a fake, I got more styles than Drake's got tasty cakes
Gotta be the best, G, don't try to test me
You'll get jacked son, even if your name is not Jesse
Let's be up front when I meet ya
Peace, uh, I'm the motherfuckin' teacher

[Hook]
When we come in all de dance 'nuff D.J.'s shut up, woy!
Gal! Will ya come slap dem up
When we come in all de dance 'nuff D.J.'s shut up, woy!
Gal! Will ya come slap dem up, up, up, up, up...
(Do it, do it, do it...) x2

[Outro]
Yo...South Bronx, South South Bronx
South Bronx, South South...yo, Uptown
Brooklyn's in the house, lemme tell ya 'bout Staten Island
What about...Queens?

[Intro]
What I want you to do is count to ten
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two
On one, you will be asleep - one

[Hook]
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up

[Bridge]
I'm dreamin...about bein a blunt
I'm runnin around and I just can't wake up, hah!
I'm dreamin...about bein a blunt, ho!
I'm walkin around and I just can't wake up

[Verse 1]
I'm tryin to wake up, I can't wake up
So I run and jump, someone yelled, "Get that blunt!"
Get that blunt, now I'm thinking this is major
I've got a bunch of people chasin me with a razor?!
I don't like this dream as a blunt
But I can't get out of it and I can't seem to wake up
So I'm runnin and racin, blunt smokers are chasin
This is insane, I'm caught by House of Pain
I'm picked up, they said they gonna put my head out
They slit my back and all the tobacco fell out
Now I'm hollowed wet thin and yes ready
They poured the shumpang gently and re-wet me
I'm in the mouth yo, I can't wake up
Yo I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up

[Hook]
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up

[Verse 2]
Check it out now, in the same attire here comes the fire
OW they lit it, now I'm burnin by the minute
But check it out, more heads came to chill
Everlast took a pull and passed me to Cypress Hill
Cypress Hill took a pull, lungs are full
Who's next? I'm bein passed to Das EFX
As they took a mad pull, smoke blows in heaps
It's really smoky but I can still see Black Sheep
Whoa! Black Sheep gets me, relights me
Room is proper, now I'm passed off to Shabba
Shabba's voice gets low like a tuba
He said, "Me no follow no rumor" and passed me to Grand Puba
I wasn't burnin right so Puba got mad at me
And said, "Who rolled this?" and passed it to Kid Capri
Kid Capri said, "I won't front!
Pass it to Redman, he knows how to roll a blunt"
Redman said, "No need to re-roll"
He hit, relit it, and passed me to De La Soul
De La Soul took a hit and kept hittin
Now they're buggin 'cause they passed me to Bill Clinton
Bill Clinton said, "I'll smoke but I won't inhale
I'll only hit it twice," he got slapped by Greg Nice
Now I fell on the floor, Greg Nice picked me up
I'm bein smoked and I can't wake up

[Hook]
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up

[Verse 3]
Get me out of this, somebody wake me up
I'm still on fire and I'm still bein smoked up
Half my body is gone, now they're comin to my head
Now my head is being pinched by Teddy Ted
A crazy nightmare I got to go
I got to wake up and I'm passed off to Yo-Yo
Yo-Yo gets respect as a lady
She didn't smoke, she passed me to Showbiz & A.G
A.G. said, "Respect due seen"
He got one big pull and passed me to Smooth B
Smooth B, although he's talking to Teddy
Took a hit and passed me to Fab 5 Freddy
Freddy said, "Yo! There's nothing left pop"
Looked at me in my face and passed me to Chubb Rock
Chubb Rock said, "Yo Freddy chill!
If you ever catch me smoking, just kick me in the grill"

[Hook]
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up

[Outro]
I'm DREAMIN!!!

[Intro]
You ain't that tough ya
Choose the right friends
You ain't that tough now
Don't make your life end

[Verse 1]
You walk around the town like you a big man
But you never know now that there's always a bigger man
You sling the M-16 and flash the M-1
But you don't know what you're doing never learned to handle one
But true! All you friend thinking you a gangster
While your mother tried to warn you from certain danger
So when you in your room you playing with your Mac-10
Fully loaded automatic, just you and a friend
You posing aw dey mirror like you a gangster clown
But the Mac-10 go off and you friend go down

[Chorus]
Uh oh! What you gonna do now?
Uh oh! They gonna blame you somehow
Uh oh! Tell me what you gonna say
Uh oh! Look, they carting you away

[Verse 2]
Your father telling you "Now son just go to school
Don't go acting like a fool and don't go acting too cool"
You get to the school and meet up with the right bunch
Just a group of kids with no names taking people lunch
You join the clique because you wanna meet some girls
And you want a likkle prestige in you likkle school world
One day you're walking with your crew along the road
And a member of your crew pull out a gun and unload
He shoot a parked car and all you run far
You and your friends laughing like you a superstar
You get home and you thinking it was fresh
And a cop meet you there with a warrant for your arrest
Them ask, "Who shot the gun? Why you walking down the street?
Didn't you see the likkle boy there in the back seat sleep?
Now the boy dead we want to know from you
Who shot the car up, are we gonna take you?"

[Chorus]
Uh oh! Now what you gonna do now?
Uh oh! Boy, them gonna blame you
Uh oh! Now tell me what you gonna say
Uh oh! Look, they carting you away

[Bridge]
You ain't that rough ya
Choose the right friends
You ain't that tough ya
Don't make your life end

[Verse 3]
White kids! You living in the whitest part of town
You are a white kid but you know you hang around
So you and your friends thinking that you are all of that
When you see a youth walk by and yes the youth is black
One kid say "Hey, what you doing on the block
We don't want no niggers here unless he is a cop"
So the kid pull out a big baseball bat
And them him slap with the bat just because the kid is black
Now then the kid fell down but still alive
So he reach in his pants and pull out a four-five
Pop! One friend drop and everyone run
Out of all the white kids now you the only one
You start cry, 'cause now you gonna die
And it's all because what your friends did to this guy

[Chorus]
Uh oh! What you gonna do now?
Uh oh! He gonna blame you somehow
Uh oh! What you think you gonna say?
Uh oh! Now them carting you away, check!

[Outro]
You ain't that rough ya
Choose the right friends
You ain't that tough ya
Don't make your life end
You ain't that rough now
Choose the right friends
You ain't that tough now
Don't make your life end

[Hook: sample from a live performance of "The Bridge is Over"]
Here's another example of the KRS-One (BO!)
Here's another example of the KRS-One (BO!)
They wish to battle BDP but they cannot
They must be on the jock of WHO? (DJ Scott LaRock!)

[KRS-One]
Yeah, one-two, what? What?
Grab any tape that you think is hard
Put it in your tape deck and press record
Get this - what's a real hip-hop emcee?
Is it MTV? Is it BET?
Is it five M-I-C's so the people can see?
I mean, how you think you free when you act like property?
Tell me, how can you judge an MC when he's rockin
I mean, rockin it live, not pickin his cotton
I mean, adjustin his clothes I mean, how do you know
Before you come to the show, and you're not gettin cheated
That you're not gettin heated, that you ain't come to the club
Thinkin, "Uh-uh - I must have been weeded!"
You got to be a educated consumer
Spend your money on MC's cause these rappers'll do ya
All they want is your cash, ass, glass, gas and a flick
When you ask for that autograph, they ass dash quick
Beware of the rapper, he talks like it don't matter
He pulls his gat while we BUST OFF the gatler
He's more of an actor, someone, into theater
Not an upright MC with styles who speaks clearer!

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
MC's have no time for the bar
Unless we politickin a tape to some drunk A&R
We grab the mic and say who we are, KRS
And start takin it to the chest of the best
This is not a test or a demo
This is when you let go of the limo, like many can't do
They may wanna amp you and chant new, record sellin
But movin the crowd is somethin that they can't do!

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
C'mon!
You got to be mistaken, I am not your boy
You fake what you creatin, playin wit'cha toys
G'wan with all that bullshit bout you bringin noise
Time for somethin more than PO-PO-POI-POI
All of hip-hop ain't seventeen
Some of us still go back to "Microphone Fiend"
Back when it was just MC's and DJ's
No video that come on and just replay

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
Uhhh... uh-huh, uh-huh uh-huh
We can never stop, forever we rock, take a listen
The t'cha is back, cause rap's whack when I'm missin
Me, I would never want the future to believe
That when they trust to look back on us there was no dope MC's
There was, all these rappers grabbin more and more money
And now that I'm A&R they look more and more funny
They rap for platinum plaques without buildin
A cultural strategy worthy of our children!

[Intro: KRS-One]
Every once in a while
You got to put aside childish things
And get with the teachers and the kings
K-R-S... Truck Turner...
Bring It To The Cypher
Like this, like this y'all

[Verse 1: Truck Turner + KRS-One]
I'm at the end of my rope, I'm bout to snap
Cut a nigga throat, put a bullet through his hat
With his head attached
What's the deal new jack? Who dat? Got his chest blew back
Clak! Clak! Bullet through his teeth, nigga true that
You in my way, move that, Truck coming through that
Run up in your spot, come out, raising two gats
Move back, give a nigga room, let me hit this
Way back, since up in the womb, I was with this
Every sentence, we doom with consistence
Be the witness, let me spit this, Kris hit this
Yo—if it's all about the hundreds, let's try to get two 50s
Don't stop and switch a temple, let's work and build a city
You see the equation, to this whole situation?
If I'm the God of rap and you battling me, you Satan
And that's why you hating, creating debates
When you know damn well that your title will be taken

[Chorus: KRS-One & Truck Turner ]
Bring it to the cypher!
(You only got platinum?)
Bring it to the cypher!
(You think you got props, son?)
Bring it to the cypher!
(You livin" hip-hop, son?)
Bring it to the cypher!

Bring it to the cypher!
(You only got platinum?)
Bring it to the cypher!
(You think you got props, son?)
Bring it to the cypher!
(You livin" hip-hop, son?)
Bring it to the cypher!

[Verse 2: KRS-One + Truck Turner]
Yo, daytime, nighttime, anytime, I got plenty time
To kick many rhymes, big time, all time
Taking it to you over time, so when I'm flowing rhymes
Bright I shine, simply cuz I'm
Lyrically be kicking out the tighter rhyme, till I climb
Bring in the chime, in your mind, you fall behind
Picking up your rhyming skill, I am fulfilled, when I kill at will
Still number one for fun, kill another one
Battle your bugging son
Look I cut your tongue, KRS-One is never done
I am the proper one, this ass-whipping will make you better son
Go and tell your mum I took a bite out of your bum
Anytime you want it, doggone it, yo put me on it
Never running up on it, you never disappointed, get on it
I simply jam, not that I give a damn
Let me tell you who I am, just ask your buddy
Put your cash on Kris, I bet you double up your money
You can call me Chris Rock, ain't nothing funny
Nigga what, let me change my style up, in a rough
Nigga duck, dropped your face, pick it up, shook 'em up
Automatic fire - Brrrrrrrruh! Brrrrrrrruh!
All up in the party, clip it out, give it up
Where's the money for this single? Get it out, give it up
Blastmaster's coming through Truck, what?

[Chorus: KRS-One & Truck Turner ]
Bring it to the cypher!
(You only got platinum?)
Bring it to the cypher!
(You think you got props, son?)
Bring it to the cypher!
(You livin" hip-hop, son?)
Bring it to the cypher!

Bring it to the cypher!
(You only got platinum?)
Bring it to the cypher!
(You think you got props, son?)
Bring it to the cypher!
(You livin" hip-hop, son?)
Bring it to the cypher!

[Verse 3: Truck Turner]
At night I let the fo'-fo' bark, spark right off the dark
Body parts chalked, where we live, how we get down
Come up on my block making noise, keep the shit down
I cripple you, pull up a wheelchair, permanent sit-down
Perfect fit now, now clown, who the shit now?
Fo'-fo' aimed at your dome, bout to spit rounds
Me and you, getting it on? Don't even go there
Once I bring it to you, you won't be save nowhere
Oh yeah, your mom's funeral don't even show there
It'll be a double burial dukes, when the smoke clears
Love you like a brother, but I'll kill you if you rally
Stay on my good side, my bad side, I annihilate
Don't hold me back, get off me, told these cats never cross me
But they crossed the line, I gotta show 'em
My fo'-fo' snub is what I owe 'em, Kris you know him? (Nah)
Ice pick, Attica style, I'm bout to blow him
Dudes get trifle, catch the barrel of the rifle
Fuck you, until more niggas looking just like you
Dump two when you hear me squeeze off the cycles
I squeeze you load (I squeeze you reload)
I squeeze you reload till this whole shit can roll
Where I'm from, that's the code, BDP got your shit sold
Like bad heads that fold at war, anything goes
Made us, broke the mold, another Bronx episode nigga what

[Chorus: KRS-One & Truck Turner ]
Bring it to the cypher!
(You only got platinum?)
Bring it to the cypher!
(You think you got props, son?)
Bring it to the cypher!
(You livin" hip-hop, son?)
Bring it to the cypher!

Bring it to the cypher!
(You only got platinum?)
Bring it to the cypher!
(You think you got props, son?)
Bring it to the cypher!
(You livin" hip-hop, son?)
Bring it to the cypher!

And represent kickin a freestyle song

[Common]
A freestyle song
The microphone I palm, like it was a Sunday
But today is a Monday, Sunday my day of rest
Yo "I'm Still #1" but I gotta say peace to KRS (HAA!!)
I can say I'm fresh when I come in
Style start to runnin, a hundred styles and runnin
Rappers I start to gunnin
This is what I do when me and KRS get together
I ask Lisa, I will be here FOR-EVER (EVER, AHH!!)
Puttin stuff together
This is how I weather with the brainstorm
Let my name form a lot of things, yo the man of the hour
Peace to, Power 106, they put me in the mix
Like Hammer but I jam a, little bit (hah, what!)
Yo this is what I'm doin when I'm feelin
Like I'm Latrell Sprewell when I start to stealin on cultures
Pullin posters, they just roaches, thinkin they the joint
I'm on point like Rod Strickland, I be the big man
Comin to New York with a new talk from Chicago
Follow, I roll like a model, hold the bottle
Com Sense I never swallow my spit, I just spit on rappers
On they grave, they better save that bull
This is my zone, whack MC's they better call Tyrone
I got me and KRS, you know the time
I show the rhyme, check it out
We show divine, how it goes down

[KRS-One]
Straight to your mental it's the style of the Temple
Worldwide representin the microphone and the pencil
Like Brooklyn Brooklyn be always funky fresh
Dope hooks and dope rhymes, that's always KRS
Their words can't hit me, their dogs can't sic me
Their knives can't stick me... {*fades out*}

[Intro: KRS-One]
Yo, yo, you know what's up!

No need to hype it but KRS-One's the one who pipe's it
These lyrical freestyles meanwhile you're gettin excited
Quickery, inginiery, over my delivery I'm glittery
I'm rhyming against biggetry while youre giving me...
...ignorance, incompetence, inexperience!Im not hearing it!
I battle with expedience and obedience, you macking the ingredients
Hiphop youre not being it!!Youre trying it
My whole style right now youre I and it
I'll take ya dark demo and put the sky in it
You say youre dope but like an Elvis Presly CD I ain buying it
{*Beat Stops and KRS-One speaks with G.Simone adding additional vocals*}

Tell me the relevance of Money without intelligence?!?!
There is none!EXPERIENCE= Wisdom!MC's I flick Dem

Stick Them!

{*Live audience laughs and sound fades.KRS continues rapping*}

Yeah! Yo!

I remind I rhymes yeah I know you opened
For sum'thing more gifted uplifted!
Topical, rocking you, if its possible
Let me give it to you logical
Give it up is what you got to do! Like a bad habit!
To battle KRS you need battle skills and magic
See this talus mineral around my neck can try to grab it
But remember: I don't write rhymes I write classics
You can get your ass kicked, get back up in ya strolla
KRS-One is seven dope albums older, the holder of a boulder
You want a fresh style? Let me show ya...
We will be here forever I told ya!!!

[G.Simone - singing]
Just let it flow...do what you know..
To get you in tha mooooood...(2x)

[KRS-One]
Watch me now, wa-watch me now, wa-watch me now Glock me now
You be looking sloppy now, drop me how?rock me how?
You can't even stop me now!
Watcha really thinking bout when you wanna think it out!?
When I'm bout to bring it out the terror that I sing a bout?
If you do the crime then you must do the time and
If you kick a rhyme and its wack thats your behind and...
Dont be blinded looking this way 'cause you'll be fine dead
My career going up-hill while yours declining
I'm the bomb on foot K-1 land mind
Bumping to this you will shatter same time!!
These rappers be blind - they simply forget
That I'm the god of rap and my pride.. study the rhyme

[G.Simone - singing]
Yeaaaaah!!If youre feelin what we're feeelinnng!
Let it floww.Yeaaahh!!

[Intro]
Be-dee-dee-da-dee, dee-dee-dee-dee-da-de-day
KRS-One comin' with the Tech & Sway

[Verse]
Yo, I rock upon the littlest set and up on the biggest set
As ill as it gets, I still manage to wiggle your neck with sweat
Never forget; the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be willin' to rock in the middle of dry and the middle of wet
But I'm willin' to bet on the Sway and the Tech, they stay in effect
Never been a pain in the neck, they gainin' respect, nevertheless
I'll wreck you, now you know what Sway and Tech do
I'll be back, but for now, just seckle!
Ha, ha, ha, ha

[G. Simone]
She won't play around - the remix

B-Boys in the house, turn it up, turn it up

(I remember..) Big Daddy Kane
(You've forgotten..) Salt-N-Pepa
(To remember..) Outrageous clothes
(I wonder why..) Uhh, oh
(I remember..) Heavy D
(You've forgotten..) Kool Moe Dee
(To remember..) Dope videos
(I wonder why..)

[KRS-One]
Remember the day, 'member the play, 'member the way we used to say
"Dee-dee-dee-da-di-dee-dee-dee-dee-da-di-dayyyyy"
Remember the jams, 'member the plans
'member the plans you made with your man
Maybe you can or maybe you can not
Remember the architects of hip-hop
It's really hard to forget about 2Pac
Respect is what the Crash Crew got
Better we ask you not, to recite the history of Hip-Hop on the block
You could forget about Grandmaster Flash if you try
You know not, the t'cha returns, have you forgotten?
I speak not to idle concerns, I keep it rockin
But you have forgotten I'm the holder of a boulder
Money-folder, we will be here forever, I TOLD YA!
To remind ya, just when them chrome rims blind ya
That them rims come from the expression of what's inside ya
My lyrics guide ya, and they fly too
Why don't you try to find who you rhyme through?
I think it's time to untie you
(I remember..) MC Lyte
(You've forgotten..) Stetsasonic
(To remember..) Fancy bars
(I wonder why..) Oh, oh
(I remember..) Brand Nubian
(You've forgotten..) Nice & Smooth
(To remember..) Those candy cars
(I wonder why..)

[KRS-One]
Some like it slow, some like it off beat
Some like smooth jazz I like it all street
We come in all shades, like coke we always
Thinkin of more ways to leave them all dazed
All hazed, all crazed and all amazed
My last name should have been Letterman like Dave
But I wasn't his slave, I'm referrin to the way
That my lyrics behave, when I rock raves
Let off shockwaves baby it's crazy not too much can stop me
I walk right in, these other cats be knock-kneed
Terrified, they still actin all cocky
When the storm hits they be screamin "MAMI! PAPI!"
"AUNTIE! SOMEBODY!" I'm from the orthodoxy
It takes more to rock me, like in "Attack of the Clones"
These rappers be carbon copies, and they hardly got the
Flow, rhyme style sloppy and old
What's up with "The Show"?
(I remember..) Public Enemy
(You've forgotten..) Dana Dane
(To remember..) Outrageous clothes
(I wonder why..) Yo, oh, oh
(I remember..) Doug E. Fresh
(You've forgotten..) Das EFX

(You've forgotten..) KDay!

[KRS-One]
Yo, oh, ah, yes, do it
Do it, ah, Mad Lion on the hookup
J Rock on the hookup
Oh, we do it just like that, just like that

[Shock G]
Yeah.. aiyyo Kris tell 'em what's up yo

[KRS]
Yo, yo yo, one two!
Comin at you live and direct (that's right)
Digital Underground kid, you know what's up

[Shock G]
Aiyyo Kris is chillin, Shock G's chillin
What more can we say, about the village
The real killers, chillin in the Whi.. I mean the not RIGHT house
Want me to be they lab white mouse
The smile of seedy greedies, deprivin the needies, breakin treaties
Overseas wildin while they profilin on the TV's
Some of 'em cool though.. see I like that nigga Bill
Hittin everything in town, and he got that smile down
Now let's break down the meaning of a smile
Is it happiness and blissfulness, well let's go down the list
You got the real deal for real-real smile
You got the phony they don't know me let me hide my feel smile
The dumb embarassed smile
The ooh she look delicious, yo that girl is lavish smile (uh-huh)
Then you got the shake your head nah black, that shit was whack smile
The across the bar, yeah it's cool, we can hit the sack smile
The crack smile, the caught in the act smile
The over my shoulder caught you schemin on me delayed react smile
The smile you're really glad to see when it comes round
The spot's hot, they got you boxed in, it's bout to go down
You glance back, your man who packs that once in a while
Gives you the - oh I'm strapped, do your thing, baby I got your back smile

[Chorus: KRS-One]
Smilin faces, sometimes
Pretend, to be your friend
Smilin faces, show no traces
Of the evil, that lurks within

[KRS-One]
Whaddya think I joke?  Whaddya think I sniff coke?
Me a wild t'ing like Tone Loc, you better be dope
When the soundclash erupt, rev up, step up to the cut
Whassup?  I show up to blow up and leave the spot TO' UP
You know what?  I'ma go nut, but you know what?  Yeah, so what!
It's the regular, when you checkin the, one that perfected the
Smilin faced people posin as your equal
Knowin they wanna beat you defeat you and eat you, but they greet you
With peace and love, not with the piece but the dove
Not beneath but above, now the cheek give a hug
Snug, no grudge, 'til you turn your back and learn the facts
Called learnin truth, the tree is only KNOWN by its fruits
These smilin faces, in many places, sometime they racist
Sometime they sexist, sometime they want your Lexus
Sometime they be your family members remember
Oh no not my lady, oh no not my fella, with them you thought
You'd never ever sever, but they was two-faced - it happens
With a whole 'nother agenda but clever to say whatever forever
Let me make this relationship better, if you real stay real
Be real, the truth we got to treasure, not these

[Chorus]

[Shock G] And they be lurkin

[KRS] You know what's up, ha!

[KRS] KRS-One, Shock Gigga!

[Shock G] That's me baby

[KRS] HA HA.. word

[Shock G]
Yo, just let the beat breathe
Uhh.. yeah..
Cause they be lurkin
Never trust a big butt and a smile baby
Uhh.. keep it goin, ah keep it goin
Yo Kris that's peace baby (uh-huh)
They know the deal
Smile ain't nuttin but an upside down frown (word)
Never trust a big butt and a smile

[KRS-One]
Word, YEAH~! So we sing

[Chorus: KRS-One]
Me-don't-wan'-me-don't-wan'-me-don't-wan'-me-don't-wan' no whack deejay-uh
Me-don't-wan'-me-don't-wan'-me-don't-wan'-me-don't-wan' no whack deejay-uh
Me don't like what they play, me don't like what they say
Me-don't-wan'-me-don't-wan'-me-don't-wan'-me-don't-wan' no whack deejay-uh

[KRS-One]
New flow, new style, comin in BOOM BAP
Who now wanna throw down, the crew's wild
One flow - you go, two flows - you outta here
We pros, three flows, buck through your outer gear
Let's raise the fahrenheit on these DJ's we don't like
You know who I'm talkin about, yo they might come on tonight
They never hype, never tight, that's not polite
Am I lyin? No you're quit right
So tonight, I be statin facts, most DJ's are whack
They be holdin back, they NBA - Never Broke a Act
Yo I'm hopin that, new DJ's open rap, bring the focus back
And take the crates from these fakes to the lake and throw 'em OVER that
We lead 'em to freedom or poetically beat 'em up
In conventions like meet 'em, see them, we plan to eat 'em up
I'm bein MC'in seein and agreein that this here cut
DEFINITELY will hit them up, so we sing

[Chorus]

[KRS-One]
I SCREAM on these rappers like directors do actors
Hang with computer hackers on farms and ride tractors
Thug spelled backwards is GUT, drop the H
If you ain't got guts and you callin yourself a thug, you a fake!
Not just the guts to bust off 44 calibre
Cause mad thugs turn bitch when you show that ass algebra
It's like... the vexed look, the sex look
The checks look, cause brothers be, scared of that textbook!
You best look elsewhere, knowledge of self here
Never no welfare, echinicea for health care
Outrappin 'em, slappin 'em, ghetto scholar like Pun, Joey Crack and them
On spraypaint we put fat caps on 'em (WORD)
Up in the yard, we go to hittin it harder
Then return to reprieve as mild-mannered Kris Parker
The exec, signin on checks, approvin budgets
But if you want it, meet me at any club, we can THUG IT

[Chorus]

[KRS-One]
N.O.R.E. goes "WHAT WHAT," Cube goes "YEH-YEAH!"
Jamaicans go "BUCK BUCK," MC Eiht goes "GYEAH~!"
Master P goes "UNGHHH," Busta RHymes goes "YAH YAH"
KRS-One goes "WOOP WOOP" like cop cars
Cause I pull over pop stars and arrest they guitars
And sentence them to the turntables, cuttin on 8 bars
Shakin 'em up, rippin 'em down, brother whattup? Gimme a pound
You diggin the sound I'm bringin around, shakin the ground, never a clown
You know that you buggin, but you also know that you love it
Somethin new and bumpin others be frontin
They can't even think about, new flows and techniques
They speak when the check speaks but KRS-One is direct heat

[Chorus] with ad libs

[Chorus]

YES!!!
{*applause and shouting*}

[KRS-One]
Yeah, YEAHHH, yeah... word
For my next number I'd like to bring up a young lady named Courtney Terry
And uh, my name is KRS-One
It's gonna go like this

[Chorus: Courtney Terry]
When the moon is filled with those that died
And you prefer the style of KRS-One
MC's around the planet
Has loved the styles you brung - hit 'em dunn

[KRS speaking over Chorus]
Feel this, feel it
C'mon! Now get your hands up
Uh, uh, uh, c'mon, c'mon
Yeah, c'mon, yeah, yeah

[KRS-One]
Open up the door let me come in the place
Before you recognize the raw yo it's right in your face
Just a little taste, yo I'm kind of nuts like Planters
Behave and your save your money cause this album is bananas
I'm flashin just a little style, for a LITTLE while
Been flowin like the Nile from when you was just a child
Now it's '98, and I will NOT hesitate
You be floatin in the lake, you not no heavyweight
You're lightweight, I devestate, on a equal basis
No I'm not a racist but no race could really face this
I hate this - no I don't; you face Kris - no you won't
You know you broke, cause what you wrote, ain't really dope
Like a billygoat, I'll ram your set like BLAOW~!
Who CARES how you like me now, you underground
Boogie Down, let me make one thing clear
BX baby, this is our year
Try here and die here it's too fly here
As I drew my spear near, think what to do my dear
I'm new and clear, my clarity's amazin
Still blazin, play the low on occasion

[Chorus]

[KRS speaking over Chorus]
You know the deal!!
Yeah, c'mon!
Uhh... c'mon, c'mon!
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah, yo, yo

[KRS-One]
I'm small and not bigger, drink water not liquor
So I smart outquick ya lyric makin move like a ninja
I'm all up in ya like blood
My whole style is devestatin you're renovatin like HUD, what?
You'd expect when I'm on the set don't forget
I'm givin and catchin wreck, you still ain't ready yet
Better yet when I connect ALL Y'ALL HIT THE DECK
Heck, you might as well sign over that publishin check
You ain't worthy, my style is ugly and dirty
If you ain't close to 30 you really haven't heard me
But don't worry, hurry into clubs I get wit 'em
Got styles for the 80's 90's and the new millenium
Only sucker MC's be like "KRIS DOESN'T SHIT WIT 'EM"
Cause they can't get with him, only the best sit with him
Cops don't be friskin him, gangs be enlistin him
Nations be missin him, you really think you dissin him?!

[Chorus]

[KRS speaking over Chorus]
Courtney tell 'em, c'mon!
Showbiz represent
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Yo, yo, yeah, c'mon, c'mon

[KRS-One]
Straight to your mental it's the style of the Temple
Worldwide representin the microphone and the pencil
Like BROOKLYN BROOKLYN be always funky fresh
Dope hooks and dope rhymes, that's always KRS
Their words can't hit me, they dogs can't sic me
Their knives can't stick me, it's GOD~! Think quickly
For those that have picked me and picked me cause I'm witty
I thank you; others, I simply outrank you
You make me laugh B - battle? Don't gas me
You should ask me to make your style more crafty
Rockin for decades a hip-hop and reggae medley
Always right when I write like Betty
Boop, together with a ready loop, and many troops
Kickin better letters with extras like veggie soup
Smashin any group or solo
You better go yo, my style is def, your style is so-so

[Chorus]

[KRS speaking over Chorus]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, c'mon!
UHHH, KRS-ONE!
Yeah, yeah, and
Uh-huh, yo, yeah, yo, now get your hands up~!

Showbiz - now get your hands up!
KRS - now get your hands up!
Courtney Terry - now get your hands up!
Yo yo - now get your...

[KRS-One: repeat 2X]
We don't care anymore (care anymore)
We don't share anymore (share anymore)

[KRS-One]
I'll keep on bringin and singin until your ears is ringin
And stingin flingin and gleamin true MC'n with meanin
It's seemin we fiendin for all the cream and all the screamin
The demon got us believin in schemin, rhymin for no reason
Every weekend we weakened, discipline is what we needin
But we too busy freakin to understand divine speakin
Is anyone out there tryin to make it better?
Or is all of hip-hop about the cheddar? Whatever!

[Hook 2X: KRS-One]
You don't care anymore (care anymore)
We don't share anymore (share anymore)

[KRS-One]
We don't share and care no more, we think this one's about lust
In every debate we create more hate and mistrust in us
Judge not least ye may be judged, show understandin
You don't know anyone's plan in life, it's so demandin
This one rippin off that one, that one rippin off this one
Listen, givin is livin and livin is givin, you listenin?
Our culture we pissin in, pissin on
Rappin for platinum plaques but when live, can't get it on

[Hook]

[DMX]
What a response, from the Bronx, to wreck shit, when it's hectic
Players wanna be stars, instead of being respected
That's somethin that I won't do of course, I break 'em off
Straight from the source, they think they boss, when they lost
Tryin to force it, when it don't fit, I'll bust you down and I won't quit
Mics and money you won't get, when dogs don't do that dope shit
Now turn it around and peep it, make sure to keep it a secret
I come down with that deep shit, straight out the sky I speak it

[Hook]

[singer]
Somehowwwwww, we got lost
And now our sharing, is gone
No one cares, no one shares
We gotta make it right, so we all can unite
Anybody in here right now with tape decks turn em on
And put em on record, I'll give you a second
I want to add authenticity to your tape
So when it's sold out in the street
You all can know this was a real party

These are poems circulating throughout the nation
Everybody's bad and everybody's tough
But how many people are intelligent enough
To open up their eyes and see through the lies
Discipline themselves, yourself to stay alive
Not many
That's why the universe sent me today on this stage
With this to to say
The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer
And in the final hour many heads will lose power
What does the rich versus the poor really mean?
Psychologically it means you got to pick your team
When someone says the rich gets richer
Visualize wealth and put yourselves in the picture
The rich get richer, cause they work towards rich
The poor get poorer, cause their minds can't switch from the ghetto
Let go, it's not a novelty
You could love your neighborhood without loving poverty
Follow me, every mother, father, son, daughter
There's no reason to fear the New World Order
We must order the whole new world to pay us
The New World Order and the old state chaos
The Big Brother watching over you, is a lie you see
Hip-Hop could build it's own secret society
But first you and I got to unify
Stop the negativity and control our creativity
The rich is getting richer, so why we ain't richer?
Could it be we still thinking like niggas?
Educate yourselves, make your world view bigger
Visualize wealth and put yourselves in the picture!

[Intro: KRS-One]
Yeah, listen to the lyric. Here we go!

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
We are the ones prophesized to return
My main concern is for all of you to learn
How to live, yes through the lyrics I give and send my friend
This age is coming to an end -
Not the world - but the age is ending. (ending)
Listen to the astrological message I'm sending (I'm sending) (Tell 'em.)
Truth is truth, whether or not you like me:
We are living now in the age of Pisces
When Pisces is over, at the year two thousand
When the Sun of God changes his house and
Enters the Age of Aquarius
The Sun of God as man is hilarious (okay)
When you think of Jesus, think of the Sun
The flaming Sun, that's where they stole this concept from
Stop believing and read your bible logically;
The New Testament is really old astrology
Jesus is the son of God - no lie -
But they might be talking about the Sun up in the sky
The Sun that hangs on the cross of the Zodiac
The Zodiac with twelve signs to be exact
Each sign is a house, and you should keep in mind
Each house equals, a period of time
The time: two thousand years and that's a fact -
It's called an age or a house in the Zodiac
The twelve disciples are twelve months of reason
The four gospels signify the four seasons
When Jesus fed the multitude with two fishes
It signified the Age of Pisces, not fish on dishes
If you read the bible astrologically it's clearer, (no doubt)
The next age will be the age of the water-bearer
It's called the Age of Aquarius, (word)
When logic and truth will take care of us
So in this age of spiritual dignity
You'll see a rise in femininity
And creativity, meshed with masculinity
You got to get with me, this is your true her-story (rrryyy!)
Do you wanna go higher...
For those interested in higher knowledge
On issues of health, wealth, and self-mastery
You are urged to register with the Temple of Hip-Hop
By filling out the attached registration form and questionnaire
Located on the album's pull-out panel
And here now, another KRS classic
Welcome to hip-hop culture
Where DJ-ing, MC-ing, graffiti art, breaking
And the philosophies are expressed everyday
Within the inner cities of America, and the world
You are not doing hip-hop;
You ARE hip-hop
Love yourself and your expression; you can't go wrong

[Intro]
The beat was supposed to drop right there
The beat was supposed to drop right there
The beat was supposed to drop right there
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh!

[Ad-lib 1]
I send this one out to my right hand man, or mens
Or womens, the whole crew, the real fam

[Chorus]
We can count the dough or kick a flow
Or chill out watchin' videos
Or actin' really silly, yo, but really, though
All that can end
Whether at the bar with superstars
Or cruisin' in the trooper car
I really don't care who you are
All I really need is a friend

[Verse 1]
If we can't have trust, then you can't hang with us
We respond to those who show respect with respect
We respond, we connect on the same deck
Same intellect, my man, never shifty, thinks quickly
If you can't understand, we boys, we boys
We could stand on the corner with a hat sellin' toys
It ain't about your Benz, I hope it ain't about mine
My man, I be dissin' in my freestyle rhyme
Gettin G's around the world, I can trust you with my girl, my man
We chillin' at the jam, what's the plan?
I'm not a yes man and none of my friends are yes men
Or women, I'm drivin', I see my peeps yo get in
Where you fit in? True friends are quick to sit in the beginning of all trouble
And when your bankroll doubles
Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble
Still, I got my own space like Hubble

[Chorus]
We can count the dough or kick a flow
Or chill out watchin' videos
Or actin' really silly, yo, but really, though
All that can end
Whether at the bar with superstars
Or cruisin' in the trooper car
I really don't care who you are
All I really need is a friend

[Verse 2]
Cause don't nobody care about us, all they do is doubt us
Until we blow the spot, then they all wanna crowd us
And wanna shout us, but you my man from way back
I just gots to say that, actin' large, I don't play that
But I can't say that, where I play at isn't fast-paced
A friend can acquire the taste to become two-faced
And that's a disgrace, there ain't nothing you can say to us
When the kid you grew up with betrays your trust
When we used to ride the bus, we had trust
Now we cash checks and drive Lex, and can't show respect to one of us
Yo, the heads I hang with ain't tryin to just get what they can get
Sit quickly backstabbin' the clique
I roll thick, but only some are friends really down to the end
My right hand men and women
Mutual support, from the beginnin'
Been in, exactly what I've been in

[Chorus]
We can count the dough or kick a flow
Or chill out watchin' videos
Or actin' really silly, yo, but really, though
All that can end
Whether at the bar with superstars
Or cruisin' in the trooper car
I really don't care who you are
All I really need is a friend

[Verse 3]
Back to back, we attack corporate America
Gettin' fees that amount to G's in every area
You my man, I ain't gotta drag you along
You pull your own weight, yeah you definitely got it goin' on
I don't see nothin' wrong with a little bumpin' car system thumpin'
Between the crew, we always got somethin'
But if we had nothin', no frontin' whatever
We'd still be crew you and me, me for you together
Word, fake people ain't worth a turd
They only want to be your friend because of what they overheard
I send this record to the well respected
Friends that I've collected
I hope I am what you expected

[Ad-lib 2]
So check it, so check it

[Chorus]
We can count the dough or kick a flow
Or chill out watchin' videos
Or actin' really silly, yo, but really, though
All that can end
Whether at the bar with superstars
Or cruisin' in the trooper car
I really don't care who you are
All I really need is a friend

[KRS] Yeah that's the one -- yo Thor-El just just check your mic

Verse One: Thor-El

So you wanna be the million dollar man, kid what's your plan
Make a deal with the devil settle for a hundred grand
Not enough I call your bluff, hit you with the stuff
Deal with this and think you're tough, gimme a call when things get rough
You get no Vette and, if I could stay leaded
I'm leavin rappers one-legged from fakin like the prosthetic
You're artificial by cripple, rap is like your pistol
Grim Reaper, I got the whistle, death I pull no tissue
Hit you, like the Mac-11, MC's subtract by seven
Callin callin for the reverand, lookin at hell like heaven
I'm on the map, makin it like the crazy on the track
Oh what the hell I get my mail while I raid you til it crack

Chorus: KRS and Thor-El

H, I, P, H, O, P, we are
H, I, P, H, O, P, we are
Verse Two: KRS-One

C'mon, uhh
Dead two in the head before some A&R tell me
I must give up the streets you lift the company can sell me
What's the sense in being large if you can't take a risk?
Thinkin a risk upon a disc means you're written off the list
I'm not sayin you can't have your fame and glory just don't bore me
When I come to see you live, and I paid twenty-five
That's, crazy loot Kris is saying I don't play those games
Killing Rhyme Sessions is the meaning of my name
But don't call my name in vain, cause I will appear
And your livest MC will get slain right here
See I do the homework, and I do the extra credit
You could sell a million records, and still can't set it
Cause the Lex or Beem is probably just the matches and a Jeep so
I'm sure your rap career now if they come before your people
Ohh Lord!! You can't be thinkin about Billboard
With the mic cord, and several thousand people just bored
Being dope live is like being insured for life
You always get called back twice, you are

Chorus 2X

Verse Three: Thor-El, KRS-One
I burn like hy-dra-cho-loric and my city got itty
He's terrible, Thor-El's incredible and terrific
Is it, that you're under the influence of local obvious
Rappers that die, but why, explain the obvious

No stoppin this lyrics from the esophagus
Rockin strictly the hip-hop populace

[Intro: Redman]
Alright everybody move back from the ropes
If you don't move back we're gonna turn this music off
And that's my word, move back!
Word is bond let's get this shit goin
Word up, it's the Funk Doc in the house
Say hell yeah!          HELL YEAH!
Say fuck yeah!          FUCK YEAH!
Word up, it's the Funk Doc Spock you don't stop
It's my man KRS you don't stop
It's the girl Angie you don't stop
With the hah haha ha haha hah!!

[Verse 1: Angie Martinez]
It's the Butter Pecan Rican speakin', deletin'
Other radio jocks that think they competin'
They pre-sweetened, like candy, I'm hot like pepper
Big up to Sandy but my name is Angie
Martinez, what a true microphone fiend is
Steppin up lovely with MY, A...DIDAS
Through your speakers, representin
Boriquas, and all hip-hop rhyme seekers
You may think I'm crazy right, but I'm crazy hype
Slay this nice y'all, everytime Angie grab the mic
I jams it right tonight, not the hardest
But peep the style of this Puerto Rican Goddess

[Interlude: Redman]
Aiyyo yo yo yo, stop the music!
Aiyyo back up off the ropes, man, word up!
Yo get from the off the ropes
Now aiyyo yo yo, KRS-One, come again the selector!

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
It's been a long time but we made it, you waited
You gettin frustrated cause these MC's in trainin
Skills on the mic for a royalty save it
Pullin down rap so that others can't make it
They can't fake it in front of KRS they naked
That same old MC trend I'm here to break it
The highly conceptional multidirectional
Hot in ninety-seven so I guess I'm flexible
Rap relieve stress so yes I guess it's medical
All your wrecking and raping is still theoretical
Redman, you know you must understand (Whatup?)
Redman, you know you gots to understand (Hah! Whatup love?)
Angie, rockin with the one BDP (Ha, haha)
Representin right now at Hit Factory

[Verse 3: Redman]
One two hah, and you don't quit
It's Kris and Angie with the ultimate
One two hah, and you don't quack
It's Funk Doc smoke weed and don't smoke crack
Hahaha, hah, and you don't quit
Hoohahhahah, and you don't quit
I rock jams like, Samsonites with mics
Stage two boomin system and flood the lights
The lyrical, fo'-fo's lettin off like suppose
Reggie Reg is rockin on the ra-dioooo!
Hahh, huh, the oooh-child too chill
Caps peeled, Someone In My Bed like Dru Hill
Raise em up, cause I feel my spot can't be touched
No time for the Pauline jack, hit the clutch
Shotgun what?? It's the high exalted
Ruler of the buddha, the cash make my pockets
Stick out like a tumor, for the consumers
I get busy with La Pluma, detonate the bomb
To make you hibernate sooner, certified luna-tic
My click run deeper than Charlie Tuna
Kahunas, raw for the able key movers
All over the hood like them Crooked I coolers
Bang maneuvers, from Jerz to Vancouver
Back to the Bronx with heartbeats ample looped up
I Blastmast like Kris, funk abyss
Like a phone chauvenist with a Roley on the wrist
Psych!  I can afford it, less I slaughtered
Three platinum niggas and none of em pre-recorded
KRS-One need to be runnin for office
So Butter Pecan Rican -- tell them to get off his

[KRS-One]
Open a de herb gate sellin pure ganja
Babylon come but they undercova
They never really want me stop sell ganja
(They just wanna take a cut of what you make so far!)
But I'm not havin it, I load the SLR
Pack the ganja BOOM! They break down the door
Pop-pop! T'ree shots, exchanged at close range
Out of three Babylon, me hit one in the brain
Pop-pop! Two shots hit da window pane
I exchanged four shots, I drop and feel pain
But I'm not hit, into the bathroom I crawl
I look out the window, it's a one story fall
I'm fallin, hit the ground and start crawlin
Soon I'm walkin 'round, blendin in with the crowd
Another day, I got away, I gotta fix this problem someday
But the very next day...

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Can't stop, won't stop - sellin mad izm
All comeptition - I gots to get with 'em
Me nah go jail and me nah go prison
(Take it to his face kid, diss him!)

[KRS-One]
I'm in another herb gate like a superstar
Eleven A.M., things are safe so far
I used to worry 'bout the competition on the block
But now the competition on the block is the cops
And even block watch doesn't know where we lay
Well.. ("Open up! It's the D.E.A.!")
Aww man, just when I went for more lead
The door opens up, I got a Glock to my forehead
("Get down! Get on the floor!") I felt the stick, I thought I was dead
But I woke up instead in a cell layin on my bed
I lay back down, then I heard the crack sound
Two D.T.'s came in and laid they Glocks down
One was whistlin a love song, as he put some gloves on
I thought to myself, damn something's wrong
Boom bap! Boom bap against my head
I fell back on the bed, down to his feet
The pain was insane but the hit was sweet
Cause these dumb-ass cops punched me right by the heat
The Glock, two shots, three shots they screamin
Then someone said... ("Hey wake up kid, you're dreamin!")
I said, "Yo dreamin?! That nightmare was hell"
But as I look around, I was still in my cell
Damn, I got myself caught up in a jam
The D.T. that woke me up was like, WHAT?!
I wiped the saliva, off my mouth
The D.T. said.. ("Let's make a deal") No doubt!
No question, now we started up the session
No need for guessin, yes they want my supplier
I said, what makes you think there's anyone higher?
He said.. ("Don't be a God damned liar!")
You killed three D.T.'s yesterday, you heard me
But still the cops you knocked off yea was dirty
Now the whole investigation is federal
We want you to point out, the rest of the cops that are criminal
He continued to say, you can't think it through
This whole drug game is BIGGER than you!
Follow our plan man and you'll be free
Let me explain one thing so you can see, we

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
Now I'm back in the herb gate, all wired up
Constantly thinkin about bein tied up
Snap out of it - I'm thinkin, "Damn we like elves!
The federal and local cops got wars with themselves;
And I'm in the middle, and can't solve the riddle
My nose is runny.." {*knock at door*} ("Let me get a 20!")
A 20 of the green or a 20 of the brown?
("Gimme the whole pound, clown, or duck down!") {*gunfire*}
God damn, God damn, here we go again
But this time I'm set up by my federal friend
Suddenly I hear.. ("Yo, move from the door!") {*two shots*}
Followed by the shot sounded like a four-four {*two shots*}
After the violence, then there was silence
Then I heard.. ("Hey yo it's us, open up the door!")
But rule number one in this game is self-reliance
So I picked up the mini-mac in case they wanted more
The door opened up, the feds said WHATTUP?
They was stickin you up, so they had to get bucked
Suddenly a sense of trust came over me
I thought to myself, "Well soon I'll be free!"
But as I turned around, I heard the gun go click {*clik-clak*}
I said wait, but it was too late - {*GUNSHOT*}

[KRS] One, two, three..

[Joe]
Come to da party, come to the dance
Everyone is fightin
So they fired up, up and away
Come to da party, come to the dance
To pull out the vinyl
So they fired up, up and away

[KRS-One]
Yeah, yeah
Hardcore lyric comin at ya they attackin ya
Rappers bite like Dracula the soul of hip-hop
I'm puttin back in ya, with the South Bronx vernacular
Bound to put the crack in your armor, I am much sharper
Than a lot of other mic rockers, slightly eccentric
But everything's authentic, when I said, "I'm hip-hop," I meant it
Emcees wanna debate the issue, but false though
If they studied they would see that they are hip-hop also
Hip-Hop you can't do it, you gots to be it
You can't confine it, you have to free it, so you can see it
As your expression, and learn the lesson, on life in ghetto sections
And what you feel is the forward direction
For black people, not these Star Wars save that for R2-D2
I got five fingers like Bruce Lee do
And with the five fingers I grab microphones and bring the
Stinger to DJ's, rappers, singers and beer drinkers
This MC's a thinker, unlike others but I won't diss yaz
You're still my brothers and sisters, Kris is
ONE aspect of hip-hop rap
Negative rap, positive rap, forget that black it's a trap
To set us back, concentrate on various rap talents
Presently the rap radio format is unbalanced
You either got the player, or the concious rhyme sayer
All day, on your radio, not with a different flavor
Someone has to DIE before you hear a concious record
People don't like gangsta rap, but concious rap, they don't respect it
The truth is people are afraid of black youth
Our expressions, our lessons and gold teeth, so..

[Joe]
Come to da party, come to the dance
Everyone is shoutin
So they fired up, up and away
Come to da party, come to the dance
Everyone is singin
So they fired up, up and away
Right now as we rockin' they shootin' outside
Now we have got to chill
We have got to chill
We can't have no gunfire because hip-hop can't build

Let's leave all the shootin' and the violence outside
I know there's some people in here, armed to the teeth
But understand
It is the conciousness behind the gun
That determines if the gun is positive or negative
So let's not blame it on no pistols, no guns, no gats
Let's blame it on the conciousness of the mind holding the gat
Tell me right now, tell me what's wrong
Please tell me something before I'm gone
It seems like we have come to the end
Should I be listening to all my friends

Is it true what they say?
Is it true what they say?
Is it true what they say?
Is it true what they say?

I'M HEARING THINGS LIKE YOU'LL BE SLEEPING CREEPING BEHIND MY BACK
YOU MIGHT BE LAUGHIN MIGHT BE JOKIN BUT I'm THINKIN IT'S WACK
IF WE ARE OVER LET'S BE OVER AND LET'S LEAVE IT AT THAT
SEE I CAN'T TRUST YOU ANYMORE BECAUSE YOUR LOVE IS AN ACT

Is it true what they say?
Is it true what they say?
Is it true what they say?

Just who do you, think I really am?
One of your mindless and stupid friends?
Why can't you simply tell me the truth?
So I can hold you, or cut you loose?
I'M NOT THE TYPE TO LISTEN TO WHAT EVERYBODY WILL SAY
BUT MORE AND MORE IT'S SEEMIN THAT I CAN'T TRUST YOU ANYWAY
YOU MAKE ME THINK THAT I MUST SLEEP WITH SOMETHIN OVER MY HEAD
FOR FEAR I WAKE UP IN A POOL OF BLOOD AND PROBABLY DEAD
HOW ARE WE LIVIN? HOW ARE WE LIVIN? IT SEEMS
YOU ARE NOT GIVIN WHAT YOU GAVE IN THE BEGINNING
HOW ARE WE LIVIN? HOW ARE WE LIVIN? IT SEEMS
YOU ARE NOT GIVIN WHAT YOU GAVE IN THE BEGINNING

Is it true what they say?
Is it true what they say?
Is it true what they say?

I'M HEARING THINGS LIKE YOU'LL BE SLEEPING CREEPING BEHIND MY BACK
YOU MIGHT BE LAUGHING MIGHT BE JOKING BUT I'm THINKING IT'S WACK
IF WE ARE OVER LET'S BE OVER AND LET'S LEAVE IT AT THAT
SEE I CAN'T TRUST YOU ANYMORE BECAUSE YOUR LOVE IS AN ACT
I'M NOT THE TYPE TO LISTEN TO WHAT EVERYBODY WILL SAY
BUT MORE AND MORE IT'S SEEMIN THAT I CAN'T TRUST YOU ANYWAY
YOU MAKE ME THINK THAT I MUST SLEEP WITH SOMETHIN OVER MY HEAD
FOR FEAR I WAKE UP IN A POOL OF BLOOD AND PROBABLY DEAD

Probably dead!
Probably dead
Probably dead...
It's meant to be evidently
When I rock so eloquently
Put the beat on and let me
Kill another wack emcee
Can't trust them, never test me
I practice and study
But I'm not in it for the money
But to me they look so funny
You can't test the teacher
The teacher won't reach intact
Through the speaker you're weaker, now sit your ass in the back
My lyrical you hear it, you fear it, you can't get near it
Cause the spirit eat Eric
And Eric your rhymes is wack
Like that, that, right back

Check it out!

Check it like this
Just skills  You know you gots to build just skills
*A phone is dialed a man says hello and a woman starts speaking in
Spanish*
You know you gots to build just skills, uh come on get down
Just skills  You know we got to build just skills, come on get down
Yeah, uh come on
I got that rip track, flip that, underground rap
When I kick back
Most of what I'm hearin be weak
So I speak through beats and the streets as I teach
I impeach, through speech, each lyric leech I reach
Have a seat in the lecture
Nothin can protect you
Hard is the texture
Of the mic wreckin rock in your sector
Better than ever remember I am no beginner
I'd like to shout out Eric Skinner
Just skills, you know we gots to build just skills, come on a get down
Just skills, you know we gots to build just skills, come on a get down
Yo, we livin in a world of private jets and limousine
The fruit we eatin as we prepare tangerine to nectarine
See everybody livin in the same routine
We need the telephone, and yes, we need the fax machine
You listen to the sound, well I think you know it's me
Now, let me educate you with my concious poetry
Me want, me want, me want, me want, me want no wack rap
Me want, me want, me want, me want, me want no wack rap
Me love, me love, me love, me love, me love it when it's bad
See if you wack rap you ought be steppin out the back
See emcees on the microphone forgettin that they black
See hear them kick the lyrics that are holdin people back
But when you hear the teacher, KRS will find the track
You bound to see the light, and you don't want return back
So listen very closely to the secret scientist
I'm sending this one out to all my inner city kids
Now you supposed to be apostle what you have inside your head
Can make you more reliable, it can make you feel dead
Now listen very closely to the way I say this rhyme
It's the thing called the brain, and the thing called the mind
But I'm outta time
Chorus (scratching on the word "can"):
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun?
No, you can't cause now you bouts to get done!
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun
Never had a gun, never had a gun?
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun?
No, you can't cause now you bouts to get done!
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun
Never had a gun, never had a gun?

On the block you just yap a whole lot
About the clothes that you got
Yo, or the gold that you got
Everybody sees all the friends in your Benz, yo, it's fat
But they ain't gettin money like that
Word to my brother Kenny, jealous one envy
The rich are few, while the poor, many
But you got gold cuffs and cars and stuff
You eatin well, but still in the ghetto you dwell
You know it's hot, so you make it known about your Glock
To any perpetrator tryin to blow up your spot
You grab the microphone and talk a good ramble
You the hardcore outlaw, criminal, vandal
Burnin emcees like a candle, but you frontin
You ain't got nothin, with your life you gamble
One day you gamble up snake eyes
Talkin all that junk about you don't take dives, you take lives
Nobody on the block tries, cause you claim you got powerful ties
So at the red light you arrive
And to your surprise you get heffed up with just two steak knives
You're terrified, they take your Benz, and what makes things worse
You ain't got guns to burst
Chorus

[KRS-One]
Hah!  They not ready, uhh uhh
Set it off, South Bronx
Set it off, uhh, check it

The real hip-hop, is over here
The real hip-hop, is over there
The real hip-hop, is over here
The real hip-hop, is over there

It's a demo, it's a demo, it's a demo, it's a demo
Steppin out the limo, KRS-One, gettin in you
From the get-go kiddo throw em out the window
Flip em like a nickel
Peep the hottest single
He'll sink them like the S.S. Minnow
That same kid that rocks the Benz rocks the Pinto
Watch my signal, I rock the rap game like Nintendo
Hey diddle, diddle, get played now like a fiddle
I watch you wiggle, in front of the audience that was fickle
Now you can't make a nickle, the sour pickle you are
KRS-One, ninety-seven superstar
I got one thing to say and let me make this clear
Everywhere, now throw your hands in the air
The real hip-hop, is over here
The real hip-hop, is over there
The real hip-hop, is over here
The real hip-hop, throw your hands in the air!

[Mic Vandalz]
Yo, been rockin rooftops, knahmsayin?
Internat', yaknahmsayin?
KRS, vandalizin, yaknahmsayin?  With the Mic Vandalz
Boogie Down, Uptown, yaknahmsayin?
It's dope, check it out

[KRS-One]
When I ain't doin a show, or bringin all the money in
Or at the studio, or home studyin
I'm checkin out Funkmaster Flex on cassette
As he wrecks turntable sets with many subjects
Huff now that's the Blastmaster connects, the larynx
To a high-tech mic set, you get what you get
Tech and Sway, index of singles is complex
On Technics sets, he wrecks, collects a fee next
While you rejects practice, suffix and prefix
Hip-Hop I reads it, and mark your album incompleted
I seen it, saw it, back in eighty-five
Platinum rappers yo that can't rock live
Their mental facilities, lack the ability
For lyric agility -- battle?  You're killin me
The real hip-hop, is over here
The real hip-hop, is over there
The real hip-hop, is over here
The real hip-hop, throw your hands in the air!
The real hip-hop, is over there
The real hip-hop, is it over here?
The real hip-hop, yo it's over there
The real hip.. now throw your hands in the air!

[Mic Vandalz]
Throw your hands in the air (get loose now)
Throw your hands in the air (get loose now)
Throw your hands in the air (get loose now)

Aiyyo I'm breakin, in this rap thing, I've been waitin
Ready for the world, rude like awakening
Homo sapien, ? ? rock every stadium
Scholars and players, here to Las Vegas
Embrace the papers, land of money makers
Brothers hate us cause the brothers ain't us

Yo yo, from coast to coast I'mma overdose you and BDP you
And Kris-Kross your mind, wouldn't wanna be you
A Uptown thing, world premier
Throw your hands in the air baby it's on
How many MC's wanna get they rep torn?
From Joe to Cage and mics in my juvenile days, I abuse
The mic get lifted, the crowd gets amused
I got next.. you lose!
But am I over ya head?
Am I over ya head?
But am I over ya head?
Yo am I over ya head?
But am I over ya head?
Am I over ya head?
Well am I over ya head?
Yo am I over ya head?

Huh?  What?  Where?  Who?
What?  Whattyathinkinabout
When who says what when how
You can't maybe follow my style
You be the child, I be the teacher
Smile, who said when, what
Mouth not shut, what?
Whenever however whenever
Whatever the cut
How you maybe could you ever
Believe, that you could so quickly achieve
These crafts, please laugh at his stupid ass
Upon your knees in glass
You lust, for everything but trust
So we bust back, with conciously charged art
With a mic instead of a brush
But am I over ya head?
Am I over ya head?
But am I over ya head?
Yo am I over ya head?
Am I over ya head?
Yo am I over your head?
Yo am I over ya head?
Listen..

Yes, us must trust us, who?  Us must trust
Not fuss with us, us must trust us discuss trusting us
Us must trust us, who? Us must trust
Not fuss with us, us must trust us discuss thus trusting us
Trusting us, us must trust discuss
Discuss not trusting us must not fuss
Us with us means us discussing trusting us
Us must trust us, who?  Us must trust
Not fuss with us, us must dicuss trusting us

But am I over ya head?
Yo am I over your head?
But am I over ya head?

[Hook]
Step into a world (Klaka klaka, klaka klaka)
Where there's no one left (Buku, buku! Alla de massive)
But the very best (Klaka, bo bo, BDP crew, bo bo bo bo)
No MC can test (but one, one, one)
Step into a world, where hip-hop is me
Where MC's and DJ's
Build up their skills as they play every day for the, rapture
Yeah, what what

[Refrain]
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on

[Verse 1]
I'm bout to hit you with that traditional style of cold rockin'
Givin options for head knockin non-stoppin'
Tip-toppin' lyrics we droppin' but styles can be forgotten
So we bring back the raw hip-hoppin'
Just like the records and tapes you be coppin'
Cop some breakdancin', boogie poppin', and lockin'
Tic tockin', guaranteed to have you clockin'
We only get better and only better we have gotten
This type of flow don't even think about stoppin'
Beware, the length of the rhyme flow can be shockin'
All music lovers in the place right now
That never understood the way that KRS got down
Yo, I'm strictly about skills and dope lyrical coastin'
Relying on talent, not marketing and promotion
If a dope lyrical flow is a must
You gots to go with a name you can quickly trust
I'm not sayin I'm number one, uhh I'm sorry, I lied
I'm number one, two, three, four and five
Stop wastin' your money on marketing schemes
And pretty packages pushin' dreams to the fiends
A dope MC is a dope MC
With or witout a record deal, all can see
And that's who KRS be son
I'm not the run-of-the-mill, cause for the mill I don't run

[Refrain]
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on

[Verse 2]
Everybody on the mic in the party sound alike
Until I recite, in black and white what's right
Let me take flight, my style is TIGHT AN GOOD
TIGHT AN GOOD, come is it TIGHT AN GOOD
Old styles I pass dat, slow down on fast rap
All in yo' ass crack, Cocaine? Don't pass dat
Conjure to ask dat, hyper type of flashback
I publish like ASCAP lyrics for hand clap
No past rappin', youth trackin', talent lackin'
MC's more worried about their financial backin'
Steady packin a gat as if something's gonna happen
But it doesn't, they wind up shootin they cousin, they buggin'
I appear everywhere and nowhere at once
I know my style is bumpin, even though some people front
It's the God of rap, you heard of it
The one that rhymes toward the sky givin airplanes mad turbulence
In rap tournaments, I reign permanent
Don't you think by now the number one spot I'm not concerned with it
The course of rap I'm turnin' it
Back to that good old fashioned way of getting cash money by earning it
No bogus hocus pocus, I bring back to focus
Skills if you notice my position is lotus
Now quote this, MC's are just hopeless
Thinkin record sales make them the dopest

[Refrain]
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on

[Intro]
Okay (Teacha), I've got one question (Yeah)
One question (Yo, Cali) Who am I?

[Verse]
The MC, la-di da-di
I don't wear Versace, I wear DJ's out quickly at the party
Who am I? If you're like me, hip-hop is in your body
Who am I? THE MC
When the jam is slow and you need a proceeder
Who am I? THE MC
When you need a lyrical leader wit oratorical triple features
Who am I? THE MC
When you need to rock your 3000-seat arena, best believe, uh
Who am I? THE MC
When you need to get the word on the street wit' demeanor
Who am I? THE MC
I beg thee, let me splurt rhymes, I have plenty
Who am I? THE MC, Lord have mercy
I hit sudden like Percy
Always New like Jersey, stay thirsty
Who am I? THE MC
Showin' my authority, superiority
An artistic minority, now you startin' me
'Cause party philosophy can only be carried out by
Who am I? THE MC
No doubt, predicting far ahead what will set the party off immensely
With plenty of who? THE MC
Trained at Rooftop, Red Zone, Roxy and Bentley's
Who am I? THE MC
Gently move crowds with harmonious rhythm
'Cause the lyrics we give 'em, they miss 'em
Who am I? THE MC, again, the MC
Her infinite power helps oppressed people sent me to tell you
If you truly study lyrical flows and stay on your toes, you will be
Who am I? THE MC
And as an MC you will study verbal magic
But watch what you say 'cause you'll attract it
Control your subconscious magnet from pullin' in havoc
Who am I? The MC
Non-stoppin' MC, hip-hoppin' MC
Verbal rockin', head knockin', quick droppin' MC
I laugh 'cause I mastered the craft MC
In sound clash I'm the first and last MC
It's sort of like Jim Carrey throwin' that mask to me
I black out and wake up to catastrophe
Three MC's dead from the sound blowin' out massively, wow
Who am I? The MC
Untouchable, can't be caught off guard with fast tracks or slow tracks
Ass cracks get waxed to the max, MC's pack raps for all tracks
Indigenous cultures, Asians, Whites and Blacks
Never missed it the linguistic of
Who am I? THE MC
Meta-lyrical, poetic, mystic MC
Hearin' the voice of an ancient spirit MC
Premeditated worder
Killin' negative concepts out the mind of the observer, MC
You deserve a break from counterfeits, frauds and fakes
Claimin' to be an MC, for Heaven's sake
Well, this MC done raised the stakes
Under the stress of KRS, contracts and mental gaps are bound to break
Who am I? THE MC, again, the MC
Conduct yourselves properly, MC

[Intro: Redman]
Hey baby bring me something to drink in here
Sit down and watch a little TV

[KRS-One]
(static) Yo they comin'. It's crazy but I know it they comin'. Maybe not
Lately I feel it coming. I knew it, they comin'. (static) This just in
President (static) I guarentee (static) Jim...Jimmy, Jimmy wake up. Jimmy!
(static) Only the Lord can save (static) 5.99 no obligation (static) Let me
Start to rock this mic (static) Now the polar bear hybernates (static) And
And what was going through your mind right now

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
Look at these weak MC's getting G's
Never wore BVD's or even bellbottom Lees
Please, with these fantisies about you selling k's
When you know you bees in front of the TV eatin' grilled cheese
On your knees you know my steez
Kris is nice with theses M-I-Cs
I'm Poison like BBD the plot thickens when I be hittin'
And lyric lickin', flippin' any mix and over the skippin'
And cable clippin', still sickenin'
Even though some people ain't admitting
Through they system I keeps it kickin'
And tippin' the scale I pay tuiton not bail
Drink water not ale, MC Hammer hits it right on the nail
I can't fail with my 7 stripes
Strike one pierces the lung over the drum MC's become dumb
Like "um?" They numb, bite the tongue over the bass drum
I am D the MC like Run, spittin' lyrics for fun
And for a sum of the bread crumb
You missed when you swung, I connected whole hum
Another one done underestimated KRS-1, yeah son

[Hook: Redman & KRS-One ]
Say blowe
If you really want true skill
Say blowe
If you want the hip hop to build
Say blowe
I'll be rocking all year round
You better cool the F out before we go up in your mouth

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
It's just beguuuun, to bubble
KRS-Onnnne spells trouble
On the mic soooon there is no double
I emerge from under the rumble
Count the truth poetic construction, audio abduction
Showbiz production for wack lyric reduction
And fly rhyme instruction keep the party hoppin'
Keep the DJs buggin' for the orthodox
Non Xerox hip hop chatter box
It was dope first crack out the box with Scott LaRock
How MC's are washed up like sweat socks
KRS-1 makes the heads nod

[Hook]

KRS-One
Yes, my son?
Tweet tweet
(x2)
You know they can't compete, ain't that right
No doubt. You better cool the F out before we go up in your mouth

[Verse 3: KRS-One]
When it's my turn kid, look at what you done did
Like my head is dreadable you edible
I kick incredible shit, for my poeple
I'm jackin' these like me so sue and Stretch like Bobbito overloops
While you sittin' on stoops I'm rockin' mics for U.S. troops in group
You screwed up, oops, I can read a true crook
Like I can read a good book
I'm hooked on hip hop culture
Look at the tip top lyrical structure
Floatin' like a soap bubble that you don't wann puncture
Or rupture, I write what I udder, mother mother mother
There's too many of us dying still trying and not doin'
Not suceeding still pursueing what you doing?
What you doing? What you doing?
The session is started departed on schedule
I beg you please lookover my lyrical menu
What other can't do I can do
Enhancing 7 levels of your mental
I dismantel stress, you're listening to the advanced lyrical best
Worldwide qualified to administer any MC test
Stop guessin' class is in full session
Now Showbiz show 'em how
{*over beat from "Phucked"*}

[Afrika Bambaataa]
True school, you got to stop BS'in, with this
New school you got to stop BS'in with this
Cause y'all don't know that y'all ALL are bein controlled by corporations
Where's your hip-hop museum? Where's your hip-hop doctors?
Where's your hip-hop judges? Hip-Hop lawyers?
Where's our hip-hop agriculturalists? Our hip-hop army?
We better have some hip-hop police police our hip-hop self
If we gon' do all this killin
We are at war brothers and sisters...

Don't stop
KRS-One
Puff Daddy
Bad Boy remix
Hit me baby

[Verse One: Puff Daddy, KRS-One]
Hear the sound of my money machine
See the 600 Benz see the chrome rims gleam
See the teacher KRS and the Puff Daddy
See the young black and famous Rich like Matty
With the power and the knowledge at our fingertips
With a style make the ladies wanna lick they lips, shake they hips
Shake they rumps, bass thump
Believin they could fly by the way you jump, player, uhh
Hip-Hop mayor, fat rhyme sayer
From the Boogie Down to the Himilayas I'm
Comentating (say what?) illustrating (yeah)
Descriptions given, adjective expert (I hear you)
Let's work, til your neck hurt (oooh)
Like Bedwork I Rock Steady, you ain't really ready
For the teacher, just when you thought you had me licked
I come equipped with another hit, oh shit!
(I hear you, I hear you, I hear you, I hear you)

[Hook]
And we won't stop, cause we can't stop (repeat 4X)
Step into a world, where there's no one left
But the very best, no MC can test

Step into a world, where there's no one left
But the very best, no MC can test

[Verse Two: Puff Daddy]
Politic with the teacher (c'mon) as the hits reach ya
Puff Daddy and KRS-One, double feature (that's right)
Uptown diplomats, watch chips get stacked
So-and-so, this and that (uhh)
Just 'Show me the money!' Ain't nuttin funny (uh-huh)
Have you stuck on stupid broke feelin crummy (ahah)
Ain't no time for Girl 6
Cause I got a ten, holdin my stack of big Benz
Correographer causin your funky dope maneuver (say what?)
Bad Boy represent, keep it sewer
Killin You Softly wit my song
Call from the heist, I know y'all better think twice (what?)
About the still number one (uh-huh) South South Bronx (say what?)
At the Latin Quarter, dancin witcha daughter (ooh!)
You can't handle me, I keep it tight
With my Bad Boy family, that's right

[Hook]
And we won't stop, cause we can't stop (repeat 4X)
Step into a world, where there's no one left
But the very best, no MC can test

[Verse Three: KRS-One]
Uhh, uhh, South Bronx
You sitin and you wonderin, how we keep it comin in
KRS and Puff again to push it, and shove it in (that's right)
The neighborhood be buggin when we we comin in, rulin
(With more Wildcats than Rick Pitino, I mean yo)
Just Coolin', like Levert, I do work
They love me, thick with G. Simone, Puffy
Young black and educated, that's how we made it (oh yeah)
Study and bring the money in, you can't fade it
This scholar, gets the dollars
While these other scholars just holler (remix)
With no dinero, your zero (remix)
You think I care what you whisper
You got the wrong picture (remix)
I'm chillin with G. Simone eatin dinner (haha)
The 1997 winner, of your respect
High tech, you get the album or cassette (that's right)
And don't forget, while you listenin, skills I flaunt it
That Boogie Down Bronx shit, we on it

[Puffy]
Scott LaRock rest in peace, Biggie Smalls rest in peace
Step into a world
We love y'all, always and forever, and we won't stop
Where there's no one left
Cause we can't stop, and we won't stop
Where the very best
BDP, Bad Boy
No MC can test

Cause we can't stop, and we won't stop (repeat 4X)
Step into a world, where there's no one left
But the very best, no MC can test
(repeat last refrain to fade)

Rock on, Bad Boy, remix, for eternity baby, BDP rock on rock on...

[Buckshot]
Yeah - this is also
A message for all y'all heads out there
Who just heard, whatever you hear
This is the Boot Camp Clik, and we everywhere
Right now y'all 'bout to get into the real mindstate
Of where this is all goin, the Temple of Hip Hop y'all
Keep your mind thoroughly placed where it's at
So you can know where it's goin
Understand?
Yeah, yeah, let's switch the flow up a little
Word.. bring the love back, here we go

You ever lost somebody, a member of your party
Your daddy maybe mommy, for them there was no copy
Just know that we all asleep, pray to the lord my Soul will keep
Life is a dream no need to weep, God's gonna wake us up from sleep
Every night we die, we practice for death
Everytime we sleep we say goodbye
But I, still can't get over the fact
That my best friend's awake and not
Comin back
So as the tears.. {tears roll from my eyes}
Uhh, uhh, I never got a chance to say

{Goodbye!!!} Trouble MC, Scott LaRock, Paul Sea, Doctor Rock
Mastadon, Trouble T-Roy, Aaliyah, Cowboy
Sugar Shaft, Eazy-E.. {got to say goodbye}
Yeah.. bring the love back, bring the love back

When you wake up, then you'll know, what was up
You won't live, so corrupt, only love, you'll take up
All the chasin and rushin impatience and fussin
The racin for somethin the hatin and frontin is makin you NOTHIN
So, die before you die so when you die you don't die
You got to die before you die so when you die you don't die
You got to die to all the world, all the guys and the girls
You got to die to lovin money and them diamonds and pearls
So as the tears.. (tears roll from my eyes}
I never got a chance to say to y'all
{Goodbye!!!} Prince Messiah, Bigga B, Freaky Tah, B.I.G
Big Pun, Mercury, June Bug, Buffy
2Pac, Darryl C.. {got to say goodbye}
Bring the love back, bring the love back, uhh, hip-hop

So remember when they die, they have only woke up
It's our wants and our needs that be chokin us up
{And I want and I need and I want and I need..}
Yo, there was a time when hip-hop was on our mind
It wasn't about no crime, just reality rhymes
If you battled me fine, but in the end we reclined
With a bottle of wine, MC's the ORIGINAL kind but
{Why did you stray..} hip-hop
{Why did you stray..} hip-hop
{Why did you stray..} hip-hop!
{Why did you stray....} bring the love back
{Why did you stray..} bring the love back
{Why did you stray..} {Why did you stray..}
{Why did you stray..} rise up y'all
{Why did you stray..} remember where you came from
{Why did you stray..} bring the love back
{Why did you stray..}

[Hook: repeat 2X]
I talk how I talk when I talk cause I been there
I walk how I walk when I walk cause I been there
On your own sleepin in the park yeah I been there
How we really gonna survive?  Let us begin there

[KRS-One]
I'm talkin to the little you but, there is a bigger you
The bigger you is spiritual, little you that is physical
KRS is givin you, somethin more than I get with you
I'm hittin you, splittin you, rippin you down with me
You busted that metaphysical rap, at the pinnacle I'm at
I'm down here just to deal witchu cats
I never bleep you, I just remind you that they don't need you
They gonna keep you for as long as they can eat you
But that mic you speak through goes from here to Mogadishu
And how you represent US is the issue
I'm not here to diss you, or dismiss you
But at any moment we can be hit with missiles

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
How many MC's must get dissed
How many young men must get frisked
How much ice can really go on one wrist
How many shots get fired at a target and just miss
We gonna live like this?
I walk the same path that Ma$e do
But he went in the church, I stayed out to face you
The difference between us is not just man to man
But in fact it's fan to fan
People that buy KRS-One goin places
People that buy your shit, they catchin cases
My people eat, your people cheat
Such is the words you speak and you reap
You can pop that shit if you like
But people that buy KRS-One, they lookin for the light
Like NYCE, Jada, Lizzard, B.C
Harold, Symone, Server yo man see me

[Hook]
{*scratched: "hit you with the real"*}

[L Da Headtoucha]
Geah, it's Headtoucha and KRS combined and
Yes, through the new millenium era we grindin
Yes, this combination right here's one of a kind and
It's Soul Supreme's dream team, we shinin
Clap, I'm tryin to tell 'em there's more to it than rhymin
It's now or never, all and together we climbin
Clap, let's rewind to the beginnin of time and
Back again, words merge over tracks like um, Shaq goes in
I, crack yo' cabbage in, we ain't no average men
My pen takes people to places they haven't been
Like the streets or the gutter, when I speak over beats
You discover I drop heat, don't compete with this brother
No, just compete with each other, I'm deep in the gutter
This underground sound, and I'm keepin it gutter
Music is - the reason I'm livin, the reason I'm driven
And givin my all to all y'all

{*scratched: "Everybody rise!" - Busta Rhymes*}
{*"Learn the techniques of" - KRS*} {*"real hip-hop" - Das EFX*}
{*"no doubt"*} {*"so you don't have to worry and doubt"*}
{*"KRS-One"*} {*"savagely attack*"}

[KRS-One]
Forgive me, I always been an indie-pendant
Hip-Hop started on my block, I remember it
It's in me, others wanna spit what's trendy
But I take it back to Mork & Mindy
Tellin these young cats, Nanu Nanu
Keep my name out your mouth, it's too much to swallow
Big up to my people, Peedo and Gato
Victory over the streets, that's our motto
I ain't forget you Choco-latte
Chocolatte, you the original not the co-py
But enough of that, run it back, we lovin that
Break from them other cats, KRS-One is back
Just look where the sun is at, where the moon is at
If you in tune to that, you can never lose in rap
Astronomy, all in inside of me
For that conscious lyric, you know who you got to see!

[KRS-One]
Listen, I don't know where them other cats be at
But we be in the clubs
We be all over the country, KILLIN IT~! (Yeah)
They can talk that club rock, this that and the other
But when it comes to really gettin down
We gets down, y'all know what time it is
Big up to my people at the 9:30 Club, Washington D.C
Big up Cat's Cradle in North Carolina
House of Blues in New Orleans
S.O.B.'s in New York
King Club in, in in L.A
Aww man it's sick, Aggie P and them in in Denver
(Word up we be smashin 'em Blast, they can't get enough of it!)
(But big up to my peoples at the Electric Factory in Philly)
(Joe guard your grill up in Chicago!)
(Big up to The Destiny in San Fran)
(Big up to the Apache Club, in A-T-L)
(The Hundred Club in Las Vegas)
(And The Spot up in San Jose)

Get 'em, get 'em (yeah yeah!)
Get 'em, get 'em (that's B & NYCE)
Get 'em, get 'em (ha ha)
Get 'em, get 'em

[Hook: KRS-One]
Let's go, let's start the show
Contracts and dough, you came to hear Kris
Let's go, let's start the show
Watch how I flow, you came to feel this
Let's go, live MC rappin
Cut mix and scratchin, you came to see me
Let's go, let's make it happen
For your satisfaction, you came to be free

[KRS-One]
From all the bull, from all the push, from all the pull
From all the critics and the cynics that there happens to be
Relax from the attacks, there's no battlin me
Write whatever you like, I will rattle you G
No hassle for me, with the freestyle skill
Believe I'm ill, chill, I be surpassin MC's
Ain't too many faster than me man
Neck movin, sweat oozin, schoolin, that's how we jam
I write with a free hand, I write with a purpose
If you bought the CD, thanks for the purchase
If you downloaded the album then COME to the concert
Don't sit in front of the computer 'til your eye hurt
Get up, get out, and join the movement
Hip-Hop culture is more than music
And I'mma prove it, whether freestyle or written
Ax yourself how KRS still spittin

[Hook]

[NYCE]
Me and my niggas go to the club with hooded jeans and boots
Fuck a dress code, fuck a tie, fuck your shoes and suits
We rock doo rags to fitteds, and throwback jerseys
Front pockets with cash, paint a wall with a slash
Gettin our drink on, burnin trees, eyes lookin Japanese
Whylin out because the DJ threw on M.O.P
Peepin how the ballers with the gators is hatin
But fuck what they be talkin this is straight from the streets
They got war comin out they mouth but they don't want beef
Cause yo I snatch them outta they ride, click click, surprise
Run your jewels, your shoes, before you make tonight's news
All downs are bet, and I'm playin for keeps
Actin like you gon' scheme, then my man gon' squeeze
Word to the {?} cause I knows you don't want it
You be up in, {?} tear while I be, everywhere
Yeah, it's like that what?

[Hook]
"It was quite evident that something new had to be introduced
In order for the music to flourish as it had in the past."

If you never heard of "My Philosophy"
Check my catalogue, check the glossary
Ministry archives, school society
Temple of Hip-Hop exhibit you got to see
Obviously I flow different from most of them
They radioactive, I don't get too close to them
Hip-Hop in the cypher, commence to roastin them
Or commence to "Edutainment," minds I open them
Up on the rooftop, scopin them
KRS this album is dope AGAIN!

[Ministry Server] + (KRS)
It's up to you and me to walk in our authority (WOOOO)
To understand we got the inner divinity (that's right)

Trust yourself, get with the movement
Www.templeofhiphop.org
Yo teacher, let 'em have it - like this, c'mon

[KRS-ONE]
You get the CD and then, it's time to see me again
You break it open and then, no we not jokin again
Turn on your player and then, the rhyme sayer again
Put in the cd and then, you can't believe me again
Turn up the volume and then, we blowin by you again
You start to listen and then, you see the mission again
You start to listen and then, you get the vision again
U-N-I-T-Y that spells unity man
On G-O-D I demand, as you can see I don't end
Your family I defend, don't battle me you won't win
I'm not livin in sin, but I'm livin with Him
Her/They/Them/Us trust yo let us begin
KRS is unique, you can hear how I speak
I be teachin the streets, I'm fin' ta reach for the peak
I rock a club every week, I keep them thugs on they feet
He's back, just me, please, don't try to compete
I kick that knowledge in college when I club it it gets rugged
And you can see that these others be garbage and I love it
Uhh, what's the state of hip-hop?  Don't confuse it with rap
It's the state of your mind, it's the way that we act
It's that thing that makes you say yo I can never be whack
It's also clickin through my lyric lickings spittin the facts
Hot tracks y'all prep for combat
Baby I'm back, they crazy whack, takin 'em out!
The philosophical flow son, that's live at my show son
I'm soundin like no one, you feelin me though?
The people want me back like they want The Arsenio Show
They want the real, not a video ho!
This is KRS-One, you gotta believe me
I'm sittin in the studio with Nice and B.C
See me tonight, we keepin it tight
It's another from the brother KRS, "Keep Right!"
Ha! Ha! Huh! Huh! What's this?
Yo, huh, huh, huh

[Verse One]
I'm the one that steps in the club, ya not see it
Givin dap, givin pounds and hugs, ya not see it
In the club I'm not lookin for love, ya not see it
Gimme the mic and I'll show you whassup, better believe it
I'm not at the bar, whatever the pub, ya not see it
Still they sendin me these bottles of bub, ya not see it
But I will open the minds of thugs, ya not see it
Who you think really bring in the drugs, ya not see it
60 million people smokin the bud, ya not see it
Cause the American way of life is bugged, ya not see it
You never peep it, yo this ain't a secret, ya not see it
They confiscate it, resell it, you retrieve it, ya not see it!
So believe it while you sit there weeded, ya not see it
Hip-Hop culture who gonna lead it, ya not see it
K, R, S One, ya not see it
Peace love unity and havin the fun, ya not see it

[Hook]
Cocaine business control America
Ganja business control America
KRS-One still causin hysteria
Illegal business control America
Diamond business control America
The oil business control America
KRS-One still causin hysteria
Illegal business control America

[Verse Two]
Yo, rise up brother, raise up sister
Visualize wealth, put yourself in the picture
Very few cats gon' tell you the half, ya not see it
Cause they're really only after the cash, ya not see it
But they wind up sellin they own ass
One album, two album, they gone they don't last
So hold on a minute now, don't be so fast
Knowledge Reigns Supreme with me ya won't crash
Ha, I'm the cat that spits the raw, ya not see it
They can't believe when I hit the tour, ya not see it
I'm not ready to retire for sure, ya not see it
I'm from the 70's, I'm down by law, ya not see it
We passed fliers door to door, ya not see it
Popularity's growin more and more, ya not see it
Conscious rap where the heart is at, ya not see it
We be screamin WHERE THE PARTY AT, ya not see it
But instead of the Bacardi sack, ya not see it
Fallin out in the party in the back, ya not see it
Let me show you where the art is at, ya not see it
Put down your money I'm takin all of that, ya not see it
All the clubs they be callin me back, ya not see it
I'm never short cause I'm taller than that, ya not see it
I'm only showin you the other way out
Maybe I'm preachin but this is what love is about, ya not see it

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
KRS, I speak when I must
This that official underground rap, this you can trust
I stand outside the industry and there's many of us
Talkin mad shit but for those who not bilingual, plenty of stuff
My whole crew is why you can't get with any of us
Reason I'm not on TV cause I'm not sellin you nothin
I'm not rhymin for a Bentley or a house this plush
I spit for the conscious, what about us?
Time's up, time to open that mind up
Temple of Hip-Hop sign up, devils we bind up
When I'm up rhymin cuts your spirit hear it and shines up
Climb up before you wind up takin

[Hook]

{*scratching*}

[Hook - minus instrumental]

[not KRS speaking]
The God of your understanding, has chosen you and you've agreed
To be here in this space and time to do something, that only you can do
Now I won't stand here to try and tell you what it is
But deep, inside yourself
As you take time to uncover, and ask yourself some vital questions
Like - what is it that brings me peace, what is it that brings me joy?
What do I love doing?
What am I willing to become highly skilled at doing?
What part can I play for the betterment of the society
And the world in which I want to live?
When you begin to ask yourself those real questions
And it doesn't have to be done in a formal way
It can be done just like we're speaking, right now
Ask yourself the question
Look at how you see yourself in just a year from now
And then go forward
And if you have children or even if you don't have children
Now begin to, look at your future beyond
The space and time that you are
Now visualize exactly, the way that you desire to live
Don't be afraid to, dream

[KRS-One]
You told me man, you need me man
Who the teacher me man, who gon' lead you me man
Who gon' free you me man, well not mostly me man
But come up close to me man, make a toast with me man
I'm not starvin me man, I be feedin me man
You won't be seein me man, cause I be bookin me man
Them lights be hookin me man, while people look at me man
They sing the hooks with me man, yo read this book with me man
How these rappers slash actors wanna fuck with me man
When we be up inside the spot they be duckin me man
I be movin me man, showin and provin me man
My wife is soothin me man, yo' life is new to me man

[Minister Server]
Aiyyo what's goin on this is Minister Server
Now you've been readin the books, seein the lectures
Hearin the CD's watchin the tapes
Now's the time for you to get rid of your fears
Aiyyo teacher tell 'em what's going on

[KRS-One]
You see me man, it don't take much to be me man
I just stay extra focused on the G-O-D in me man
Not too many ahead of me man
If rappers were television channels I'd be C-SPAN, believe me man
Don't nobody sound like me man, I'm a free man
For that golden age hip-hop, you know you gotta see me man
From 1973 man, to 1993 man
If you unaware of them 20 years you won't understand me man
So here's the plan for you and me man
Hip-Hop is not a product to be bought and sold
Hip-Hop is you and me man
So in the years to come you gonna see me man
On top of a Shaquille like Leland
And you gonna be right there with me man
As you can see man I got S-T-Y-L-E man
Why for 17 years you already knew this about me man
So you be you man, and I'll be me man
But remember Knowledge Reigns Supreme - yup, that's me man!

You wanna bug out you'll get, sprayed up - NOW~!
(Bo bo bo bo... yeah!)

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
It's the Temple, expandin your mental
Inebriated instrumentals believe me nothin defends you
When I spit, rappers be runnin out really quick
They come with that silly shit, but them not really it
Kris is it, them an idiot, if it wasn't for radio programmin
You wouldn't be feelin it, or willin it
Original, metaphysical, meta-lyrical
Forever spiritual, really man, I ain't feelin you
(Yeah! Yeah! Whattup?)

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
I'm somethin like a phe-nom-enon, fast like ramadan
You can never tell what style I'm on
Wise like Solomon, unlike any udda mon
If you lookin for that bling bling, go check dat udda mon
What I utter mon be butter mon, straight from the gutter mon
Boxcutter in one hand, buck in the other one
Lyric I got a ton of 'em, gunnin 'em, not frontin 'em
Back again, it's KRS-One and them, OHH~!
(Woooo! ... So)

[Hook]

In the name of the force who is the source who is called by many names
Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh, Elohim, Jah, El Nu, El Kuluwm, The All
And as we give praise to the creator
And we give praise for all you human beings
Who's down here on this planet, so-called Earth
And to all the extraterrestrial beings
In other planets and other places and other dimensions
Throughout our universe of universes
I greet all of y'all with the greetings words of PEACE... {*echoes*}

[Intro]
Vroom vroom vroom vroom
My mind is racing
Vroom vroom vroom
My mind is racing
Vroom
My mind is racing

[Verse 1]
When you young you talk shit and get slapped up for it
The ice, the cars, the clothes, we already bought it
The streets, the projects, the hood, we already support it
The rep, the respect, them cases we already carted
The gold, the platinum plaques, we already flaunted
The leathers in freezing weathers we already sported
The wise see your lies and you already shorted
Them boys they talkin to boys, we men we ignore it
The whole planet, so-called Earth, we already toured it
My levels be on max with the bass distorted
When the economy is up we getting all of that
When the economy is down we still touring Jack
Look back at '88, where them ballers at?
They was buyin' out the bar, I ain't fall for that
Spending they money, you'd think the club would call them back
But they didn't, that shit was all an act
I go

[Hook 1]
Vroom vroom

Vroom vroom vroom
My mind is racing
Vroom
I said my mind is racing like
Vroom vroom vroom

I'm a warrior
I'm a warrior
In this concrete jungle it's hard to stay humble
I'm a warrior
I'm a warrior
I bring that drama to whoever, whenever, WHAT!

[Verse 2]
Yo, let me tell you 'bout defeating the drama
In the street with the armour
It's the teacher, Kris Parker
I be in the hood, looking good, speaking of honour
Being a father
Not avoid the baby mama drama
Respect myself I gotta, we gotta live proper
The True hip-hopper, hits yes a non-stopper
A no quitter, heavy hitter
Looks within to, be the winner
Now let us begin the orientation
Hip-hop culture is what we call the nation
But annihilation is what we facing
Cats getting killed from Scott La Rock to Jam Master Jason
That's why we was at the United Nations
Laying down the foundation
For hip-hop as a real nation
You know what time we wastin?
But...
Vroom vroom
My mind is racing
Vroom vroom vroom
My mind is racing

[Afrika Bambaataa]
We got to understand rap been here for a long time~!
When God talked to the prophets, he was rappin
And when the prophets talked back to God, they was rappin
And then if people wanna bring it up and get all up to the modern days and ages
We can start to goin in the 60's when you had Shirley Ellis
When she did "The Name Game" and "The Clapping Song"
We can go to the poetry rappin of of sister Son.. Sonia Sanchez
With uh The Watts Poets, or The Last Poets
We can get into the political or the message rap
Of The Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan, Malcolm X
Or The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
We can get into the the the the party and fun raps
Of Pigby Markam{?}, Marks Baby{?}
We can go back to the "Hi De Hi De Ho" with Cab Calloway
We can go back to the radio disc jockey or jocko
Eddie OJ, and all the others that did things
We can go back to the LOVE RAP of Isaac Hayes, Black Moses
To the LOVE RAP of Barry White out there
This is all part of rap
And if all you country people want to get into the country & western thing
We can take it to, Tony Joe White, when he did "Poke Salad Annie"
This is all dealin with the rap
Rap has always been there... {*echoes*}
Where shall we land, there?
Which city shall we destroy today?
This one, or that one?  This one?

[KRS-One]
Take a look a look around, we last forever
We carry books around, manuals are bound in leather
We rock the center, the only point that's in the circle
We free MC's, what we decree will not desert you
We know what we doin, we wise and we chillin
We calculate against the continued cries of our children
They may be cryin now but they won't be cryin later
We love hip-hop, because WE are it's creators
So we, build the Temple, write the books, teach the classes
Create instrumentals, write hooks and rock masses
NONE passes, without studyin this flow
It's all good as long as you know Kris know!

[Chorus: Mad Lion]
While I deal with I, Jah talk to I
When I dem go alike, only de one comply
Whatchu see with de I, look twice toward de I
If you don't unify your children them a gon' cry

[KRS-One]
I stand with the rejected, the unsuspected, the unconnected
The neglected the one you, never suspected
It seems you forget hip-hop plays the back
Sayin that's my sound, and that's my sound
And that's my track, and that's my rap
And that's some chorus they did way back, look honey bringin it back
I'm actually, I'm everywhere at every time
Animating every rhyme and every dare in every mind
KRS is my representative on Earth
Challenge him not, he's been hip-hop since birth
His main objective, is to put hip-hop in perspective
Show pity, and DESTROY these wack cities

[Chorus]

[Mad Lion]
Inna style dem a {?}, yo alla dem a cry
Dey worship slackness and to be under sky
We lead dem to de water but we cyan't make dem drink
Pussy to take a sip, cause it gon' make you t'ink
We don't usually {?} shit {?}, yo alla dem a sing
Wisdom wort more den any diamond and gold
People use it and find it like de Dead Sea Scrolls

[KRS] Take dem Lion, take 'em, take it over!

[Mad Lion]
Cause of dem outer, dem outer, dem outer inter outer inter
Outer inter outer inter out of control
Dey neva find wisdom til dem dead ohhh
Mad Lion make de {?} roll
KRS make up a sea and bulge ya
Of the story of never been told-a
Cause we outer, outer, inter outer outer ese
Out of control, out of control
I'm so serious ay (what?)
We don have no time fi play, ay (tell 'em again)
Some people diss dem {?} hell's in this world
But dey'll come around one day

[KRS-One]
Yo, yo, only Beezlebub think my voice is aggravatin
Children of light hear my voice and start congregatin
The mind's debatin, is he a prophet or is he Satan?
But the tree is only known by it's fruit, what am I creating?
What am I stating?  Have I stood the test of time?
Or am I fading, or has God blessed my rhyme?
Settle your dissin, you better be listenin, forever we glisten
The metaphysician with a better way, makin a better day daily

[KRS-One]
It don't stop, word
It don't stop, we still spittin! Word
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, Over Nearly Everyone
When you gon' get it? Aww man

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
Watch how I spit 'em, watch how I hit 'em
Inebriated rhythm, we get up all in 'em
KRS you gotta get him, we the best we always win 'em
Them cats won't admit I'm in the club rippin they shit
I'm raw when I'm on tour you better be sure when you get 'em
'Til you hit the floor and spin 'em, them elements do you live 'em?
Or are you just usin 'em, confusin 'em and killin them
Your touring is boring, your minimum ain't fulfillin them
So let's start drillin 'em, why we ain't feelin them
Cause we lookin and lookin and don't see that real in them
Cars we be wheelin them, minds we be healin them
With books and CD's, believe me we straight dealin them
Live in the club them thugs hit the ceiling
When they get the feeling KRS-One start delivering
So who's up? (Akbar) You live hip-hop?
Yo, get on the mic and show 'em what you got

[Verse 2: Akbar]
This whole rap game is a gamble, some MC's can't handle
Financial freeze, your record company's at a standstill
While I breeze through a sample, and lead by example
Find fertile minds and drop seeds by the handful
Man you ain't gotta hit me in my head with the anvil
I grow wise, I recognize the lies and the scandal
Once you sign on that line, your career could depend on
These white collar crooks who cook the books like Enron
So I took an oath to speak no lie
While mad rappers die over beef like E. Coli
I guess you thugs won't get the picture until them slugs hit ya
I ain't a hater, but sooner or later "Love's Gonna Get 'Cha"
And if you don't know that, then you dumb fella
And everything I said, went right over your head, like an umbrella
So who's up? (L) You live hip-hop? (Damn right)
Yo, get on the mic and show 'em what you got

[Verse 3: L Da Headtoucha]
Categorize me with the best clique, rhyme majestic
With it I get sick and mo' connected
So electric my energy is remembered I'm limitless
My mind screamin just against the rhythm, intense is the ism
In 'em I long salute the young and hungry to shine
Nightmares of lost time haunt taunt me to rhyme
Been isolated, waitin years to finally reappear
Cheers I made it, all praise due, Inebriated
These words are weaponry, huh, mental telepathy
Rocks for definite, reppin it, 'til the death of me
Pain left in me runs deep, and leaks through the speakers
In Jeeps and tape decks, then connects to your peeps
We keep it, thorough borough to borough, city to ghetto
Rock like, heavy mental on the, instrumental
So who's up? (Illin') You live hip-hop?
Get on the mic and give it what you got

[Verse 4: Illin' P]
I got five on it, you want it, flaunt it without hesi-
Dues paid check the rezzy, the black film be
That of a blunt's ashpassed via the spectacular cast
To get at the mass and choose sets, listen
I rep even when I be fingerin 'em, get it, probably not
Probably thought I meant that snitch talk
Starvin your brain, I never come with the simple and plain
To get at these thoughts, get on the train of
Come mek mi learn ya bwoy, you nah fi toy wit de sum'n
Microphone check one, no frontin
You niggas is mimin your rhymes cause y'all ain't sayin nuttin
So mi dust off mi foot bottom pon unuh mat
Cause fi mi good will stay huntin'
Fi a new day, mon, unuh fi wake up
Industry fi get shake up
Married to the ghetto you niggas fi get break up
Ahh so who live hip-hop
Upon de hip, me ride the Soul Train ock

[Verse 5: Supastition]
Yo I'm not to be confused with these popular new names
I been paid my dues I'm at the top of the food chain
And I should get an award for slept on peeps
So this beat'll be perfect for my acceptance speech
Forever loved in your city, thanks to rap
My album's a continuous seller like fitted Yankee caps
I'm like a demon, crossbred with a ragin bull
I'm from the South but I relate more to "Paid in Full"
So focused on my grind, I'm potent when I rhyme
Tell niggas close your fuckin mouth and open up your mind
It takes more than a few weeks to learn
I make sure rappers and microphones ain't on speakin terms
As far as you concerned, I'm losin my temper and patience
Nobody takes shit serious like an impotent rapist
So who's up? (An Ion) You live hip-hop? (True dat, true dat)
Yo, get on the mic and show 'em what you got

[Verse 6: An Ion]
I'm aggressive, progressive, words young ticker be vital
Rip the game and the name to reclaim any taken title
Directly hand out stares to the needle as it rotates
An agent to decrepit from rigormortis in flow eighths
Not even for a minute can you rap
Let down by the sound that drowns the clowns even dare to step
Don't ride the rhythm, I order you to jock
Your claim to fame was holdin down but you can't hold cock
Damn right we can fight, I stay with grudge
With no prior budge from the previous
And when is it that fourth'll crack cranium, kids come in the picture
Knowin that asshole and Ion and you ain't the perfect mixture
Like Alice, diners become the impeccable haven
That any enter my zone must be stripped down and shaven
I stand before you as a fiendish critter
Creatin causin collision with a pen
Written that hatred of spaced-out squashed men like it was a sin
The only job payin me enough to snuff the rough
Should have never planned the plan to make you perish
Leavin your fan and your uncle and son with somethin he can cherish

[Hook: KRS-One]
Well are you ready for this? (We ready for this)
Are you ready for this? (We ready for this!)
Well we just can't miss (just can't miss)
Well we just can't miss (drop the beat like this)
Well are you ready for this? (We ready for this)
Are you ready for this? (We ready for this!)
Well we just can't miss (just can't miss)
Well we just can't miss

[KRS-One]
Well when I speak this
I'ma be like this, I'mma be like Kris
I'ma teacher, I'mma preacher, I'mma free my kids
I'ma grow dem and show dem what a leader is
I'ma teach dem the laws of receive and give
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, believe and live
You done heard the hype, COME to where the talent is
"I'm Still #1," yup you heard right
People say, "KRS-One you shine bright!"
Others say, "Yo - you rhyme tight"
When you find me, you find light, and that's alright
I don't know about pimpin, sellin women like retail
Or turning coke into crack for resale
But I do know if we fail
In 2020 our children by the million gonna be jailed
We got the victory over the streets
God willin we chillin, we know we gon' eat
I'm a whole different kind of MC, hoes don't like
Not tempt me but the ladies treat me oh so gently
Universities sendin me stretch Bentleys
My seminars and lectures, are rarely never empty
We teach students plenty, honorary degrees
Gold and platinum plaques I got many, ask Kenny
People get shocked when I walk into Denny's
Or the corner Kwik-Stop, they say, "That's Hip-Hop
Right there," and yeah it's really quite clear
2004 might be the right year
For mental and spiritual repair
The solution is in the resolution you just declared

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
When I speak like this
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, hip-hop philosopher
All in the street well I'm very popular
All through the hood I make all the stops and I
Avoid the cops and them random shots well I
Love hip-hop and I, live hip-hop so I
Spit that shit to get you off your block cause I
Can't understand and I, wish I could see dem
Cats that talk bout they love the hood and they
Never bring the hood anything that's good, and they
Rap for the money tree, chasin a company
But I think you can now see, rap is fun to me
I got a ministry, a class, a staff that's under me
KRS in pop rap?  Nah, it ain't ought to be
It'll never happen like, you eatin pork with me
Amateurs hawkin me, DON'T EVEN talk to me
My house is in Atlanta but I still got New York in me
Walk with me, most rappers are short to me
I'm like Chamberlain, dominatin the sport you see
I toss MC's off of me
When you hear KRS you say that's how it ought to be

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
I drop heat like this!

[Intro]
{"Stop scheming!" - Milk Dee}
{"What more can I say?" - Milk Dee"}
{"Stop scheming!"}
{"What more can I say? - Stop scheming!"}
{"Stop scheming!"} (x2)
{"What more can I say?"}(x2)
{"Stop scheming!"}

[Verso 1: KRS-One]
Yo I'm, I'm here to see a friend
He came here last night about 12:10
The charge?  Well he killed his girlfriend
Huh?  Fill this out - yo you got a pen?
What time did I come in?
Yes, yeah I'll follow you
Oh there he go - yo whassup?  Man you went OUT yo!
Tchk, yo how you shruggin' your shoulders?
You lookin' at double life here soldier!

[Joe - singing #1]
Tell me what was on your mind
You should've thought a second time
Now you gotta leave your dreams behind
For life.. {"What more can I say? - Stop scheming!"}

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
See that's what I'm sayin', you gots to change your attitude G
Listen to me, the judge seein' your case is a thirty-three degree
Maybe you can find your pops, a thirty-three degree
And see if you can be free by no later than three
Yo why you lookin' at me like that?  What'chu mean it's whack?
You got a six figure bail and not a dime in the sack
See I told you, one day you'd caught her last time creepin'
You shoulda just let her go but you couldn't stop schemin'

[repeat 2X: Joe - singing #2]
Shoulda just walked away, walked away
Walked away..
Now they got you locked away, locked away
Locked away.. {"What more can I say?"}

{"Stop scheming!"}

[Joe] Whoa-ohhhh!

[Verse 3: KRS-One]
Nah nah, na nah nah nah yo listen man you ever heard of
The fact that you get one time for premeditated murder?
Um, don't argue man just yesterday y'all were kissin and huggin
What you lost your temper or somethin?
Huh?  Yeah well killin a lady WORSE
You should always think FIRST!
Yo I'mma try to.. tchk here comes the C.O
Yo whassup time's up!  Yo I'll say whassup to your P.O

[Joe singing #1]

[Joe singing #2] - 1/2

{"What more can I say? - Stop scheming!"}
Yeah
Y'know when advice is in your face, you need to heed that
Word, you need to read that
Y'know, I put this lil' joint together real quick
You know what it's called?
It's called - NOW YOU'RE FUCKED!
That's right, listen

[Verse One]
Wasn't you the type to mimic what you saw on TV?
Wasn't you the type to mimic what you heard on CD?
You never wanted to work you wanted everything easy
You heard KRS and you said, "That's preachy!"
A wise young man says, "Father - teach me"
A foolish young man wants to live life freaky
Oh yes, Knowledge does Reign Supremely
When I said it eighty-nine you didn't believe me

NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. that's right
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. life is over, finished, done
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. better heed that, read that
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED!

[Verse Two]
Listen - back in the days on the Boulevard of Linden
BROOKLYN!  Kris was a, metaphysician
LOOKIN!  For better ways to live without bein
TOOKEN!  We started our own management and
BOOKIN!  Makin moves with them live cats on
FULTON!  I can't even 'member all the dough that we
TOOK IN!  But you was lookin down on us
Cause platinum never astounded us, so

NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. word, like that
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. ha, you shoulda heed that, you better
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. y'all was chasin the radio, remember that?
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. what they givin you back now?

[Verse Three]
Back when we was all singin "Monie in the Middle"
You wanted to wiggle, jiggle in a tight skirt and giggle
Even when outside was brittle, you still had on little
And KRS warned that you'll get played like a fiddle
Now you havin cravings for pickles cause you pregnant
And don't know where the dad went and you poppin them drugs like Skittles
When the baby is born it's little and sick
But it's no riddle, you was movin too quick, huh

NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. word, look at this
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. you shoulda stayed home and read a book
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. literally, symbolically
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED!

[Verse Four]
When advice is in your life you need to take it
Cause frankly, everybody ain't gonna make it
Back in the days we, showed 'em the way
I put it there in the music but you weren't amazed
You would criticize, debate, and basically hate
But let it be known I wanted everyone to be great
But you would diss and not even try to do better
When we was at the U.N. you said "whatever"

NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. word
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. we movin ahead, you still in the same spot
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. 'member all that back talk, all that?
NOW YOU'RE FUCKED! .. takin over

[Chorus]
(Ah, yeah) That's what you say when you see a devil down
(Ah, yeah) That's what you say when you take the devil's crown
(Ah, yeah) Stay alive, all things'll change around
(Ah, yeah) What?
(Ah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
So here I go, kickin' science in ninety-five
I be illin', parental discretion is advised still
Don't call me nigga, this MC goes for his
Call me god 'cause that's what the Black man is
Roamin' through the forest as the hardest lyrical artist
Black women, you are not a bitch, you're a goddess
Let it be known, you can lean on KRS-One
Like a wall 'cause I'm hard, I represent God
Whack MCs have one style, gun buck
But when you say, "Let's buck for revolution", they shut the fuck up
Can't get with it
Down to start a riot in a minute
You'll hear so many baow-baow-baow, you'll think I'm Riddick
While other MC's are talkin' about up with hope, down with dope
I'll have a devil in my infrared scope, woi
That's for calling my father a boy
And klak-klak-klak
That's for putting scars on my mother's back
Bo
That's for calling my sister a ho
And for you, buck-buck-buck
'Cause I don't give a motherfuck
Remember the whip, remember the chant, remember the rope and
You Black people still thinkin' about voting
Every president we ever had lied
You know, I'm kind of glad Nixon died

[Chorus]
(Ah, yeah) That's what you say when you see a devil down
(Ah, yeah) That's what you say when you take the devil's crown
(Ah, yeah) Stay alive, all things'll change around
(Ah, yeah) What?
(Ah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
This is not the first time I came to the planet
But every time I come, only a few could understand it
I came as Isis, my words, they tried to ban it
I came as Moses, they couldn't follow my commandments
I came as Solomon to a people that was lost
I came as Jesus, but they nailed me to a cross
I came as Harriet Tubman, I put the truth to Sojourner
Other times, I had to come as Nat Turner
They tried to burn me, lynch me, and starve me
So I had to come back as Marcus Garvey, Bob Marley
They tried to harm me, I used to be Malcolm X
Now I'm on the planet as the one called KRS
Kickin' the metaphysical, spiritual
Tryin' to, like, get with you
Showin' you, you are invincible
The Black Panther is the Black answer for real
In my spiritual form, I turn into Bobby Seale
On the wheels of steel, my spirit flies away
And enters into Kwame Ture

[Chorus]
(Ah, yeah) That's what you say when you see a devil down
(Ah, yeah) That's what you say when you take the devil's crown
(Ah, yeah) Stay alive, all things'll change around
(Ah, yeah) What?
(Ah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
In the streets, there is no EQ, no dee-do-ee-do-ee-do
So I grab the air and speak through the code, the devil cannot see through
As I unload into another cerebellum
Then I can tell 'em, because my vibes go through denim
And leather, whatever, however, I'm still rockin'
We used to pick cotton, now we pick up cotton when we shoppin'
Have you forgotten why we buildin' in a cypher?
Yo, hear me, kid, government is building in a pyramid
The son of God is brighter than the son of man
The spirit is, check your dollar bill, G, here it is
We got no time for fancy mathematics
Your mental frequency frequently pickin' up static
Makin' you a naked body, addict, and it's democratic
They press auto and you kill it with an automatic

[Chorus]
(Ah, yeah) That's what you say when you see a devil down
(Ah, yeah) That's what you say when you take the devil's crown
(Ah, yeah) Stay alive, all things'll change around
(Ah, yeah) What?
(Ah, yeah)

[Verse 1: KRS-ONE]
Check, I control your mind with one rhyme I speak
And get you open like a prostitute's butt cheeks (yeah)
Rappers get kicked in they mouth with cleats
Cause they're speech refuses to reach beyond the beach
Have a seat quick (uh) I speak or spit flicks on your cheap hits
Time to complete shit, no weak shit, I mean freak shit properly
I can feel myself becoming a lyric monopoly
Others will copy me but repeat my shit sloppily
Shocking me with inclinations of rocking me
Insanity it got to be
My true identity is never meant to see
I simply use the gifts sent to me mentally

[Busta Rhymes]
Yo! Word up! Get from out my face, before you get bust quickly!

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
That's the hip hop, the hibby
I rip it in a minute cause I'm gifted like December 25th
Now let me flip I'm all knowing, lyrically syllable growing
Even when it's snowing, I'm party going
Free flowing and stomping! Never tip-toeing
Overthrowing the comp Big up Bronx!
I got more styles than the planet got women
I got as many rhymes as is many styles of women (tell 'em)
Don't make me come out on that ass start flippin'
Your mental I'm afflictin', actin' ill and sickin'
Pickin' the victim at random, slammin' 'em
Draggin' them to the stage and dismantlin' them
As my Hydrogen turns to Helium, I shine
None of your lyrics I'm feelin' 'em, you rhyme
Like you should be wearin' an apron scrapin' a pot with a name like Mariam

[Hook: KRS-ONE]
But rappers talk too much shit
And can't back it up with lyrics
Build ya skillz

[Verse 3: KRS-ONE]
It's time for the raw shit, not that on tour shit
That outlaw shit, that real hardcore shit
KRS runs shit like diarrhea
Bitin' motherfuckers hear my name and get up outta here
I don't care this year, a lot of albums is whack this year
"Will KRS bring it?" Ahh yeah!
Thanks for the invite, it's just about to get hype
That straight up raw street type shit is what it feels like
I will be displayin' lyrical styles I'm saying
Lyrical styles from the miracle child
Want a pile of ill styles wildin' on your stereo dial?
Smile, I been here for a while
Peep my style while I go on with the song
I rock the microphone then take it to the streets with the Krylon
Clicka clacka! clicka clacka
Take a spray can and slap a wack rapper!
Stacks of money for videos I don't have it
You're lookin' at the last MC with true talent
Get your tape recorder fast kid
Boombastic another classic
Turn up the cassette!
All my styles are lyrically fantastic and movin'
While soothin' any urges for booing
Ungluing your mouth from my private
The more the merrier syllable superior
East coast- West Coast battles are inferior
Cause I by myself will take out the whole North America
We need to expand rap beyond this land
Set up competitions with England and Japan
World cups for rappers that really fuck shit up for fun
Yeah I know I'll get one

[Hook]

[Intro]
Yeah.. yeah.. yup!
You know I was just downstairs
And I was on my way up here to the studio and
A guy bumped into me and
And he said.. he said, "Yo Kris!
How is it that you stay in this music?
You know, this rap music especially for so long, so long"
I said, "Well you know years ago I made a deal with the Goddess"
He said, "The Goddess?"
I said, "Well yeah, you might know her as God
But I know her as the Goddess"
The universal mother
The mother of everything you see in existance
I asked her for assistance
In lyrical persistance
And she gave it to me, under one condition
She said, "I'll give you the gift
But use the gift to uplift"
I said, "Okay mom!"

[Hook]
So I tell you the truth, really
Me nah gon' need nuttin else
But health, wealth, and knowledge of myself
Me nah gon' need nuttin else
But health, wealth, and knowledge of myself

[Verse]
In the beginning was the word, the word was made flesh
Knowledge K. Reigns R. Supreme S
Some of us guess while others of us are blessed
Take heed to the word, that I manifest
I manifest the future, the present, followed by the past
Everything in nature, rules by kickin ass
What they tellin me, but yo, you a friend to me
So I'mma tell you the secrets of MC longevity
Secret one: if it ain't fun, you're done
And about your career, huh, well choose another one
If you don't like what you do, you're through
Lesson two: make sure you got a dope crew
Not some crew, that's like an anchor on a shoe
A MAD CREW, that's of some benefit to you
Lesson three, might be contradictory or funny
But MC's should have OTHER WAYS of gettin money
That's to say learn other things beside music
Make money elsewhere, Hip-Hop you won't abuse it
Too many MC's, just emcee
So their longevity, is based on an Uncle Tom at the record company
Lesson four: sell your image, never sell a record, image is respected
Records come and go and get collected
Even the records of platinum artists, that used to rip shop
Can be bought, for a quarter at the thrift shop
Which brings me to lesson number five, the illusion
Has me thinkin, the minute they drop a record
They'll be cruisin, in the Acura
Slow down!  You're still a amateur
What seperates the pro from the amateur is stamina
Not how long you can rhyme, but how long you've been rhymin
Changin with the times, and findin yourself
Still climbin for wealth
Blow for blow, you're still growin, still showin
(all knowin) now that's a pro at it

[Hook]

Thank you Mother, I'm out

[Intro]
Some fear de 'matic
Ah hah hah, heh heh heh, EHHH
Check it out

[Chorus]
Some fear de 'matic, yes de automatic
Disrespect, from MC's, me nah go have it
De automatic, get de automatic
Tonight a rapper gwan die

[Verse 1]
Crazy MCs waste they time chasin millions
While KRS-One, holds the minds of the children
I'm buildin a followin of a hundred and forty-four thousand
Chosen few heads up in project housin
A true rapper, street rapper, rappin to the center
I enter any cipher, with tales of adventure
If rappers are ridin beats like cars, I'm bendin mad fenders
Put down your mic and surrender
You's a pretender, Blastmaster KRS rules the pavement
Kickin Edutainment while you wait for your arraignment
Save it friend before your chest I cave it in
I got my way again, I'm classical like a fuckin Harley Davidson
How do you think I kick a lyrical style no end, you figure?
It's simple, I'm a rap God, and youse a nigga
Don't mean I'm bigger, it simply means I'm smarter
For starters, I come at you poetically harder

[Chorus]
De automatic, get de automatic
Disrespect, from MC's, me nah go have it
De automatic, get de automatic
Tonight a rapper gwan die

[Verse 2]
Ha hah, fake ass rapper, how you think you got juice?
When you rock a pair of panties underneath your bubblegoose
(Word) KRS-One will fuck up parties dramatically
My reflex'll slap a wack rapper automatically
When you was home witcha mother, afraid of the dark
I was sleepin out in Prospect Park
Eatin one meal every 48 hours
Writin dope rhyme styles that you now devour
Don't you realize, that I'm all about survival
I got only friends cause I KILLED all my rivals
Show up at the rhyme recitals, took they titles
From '86 to '96 completes my first cycle

[Chorus]
De automatic, get de automatic
Disrespect, from MC's, me nah go have it
De automatic, get de automatic
Tonight a rapper gwan die

[Verse 3]
I spent 40 days, and 40 nights in the wilderness
I'm hard, from head to toe yo there ain't no killin this
I wrote over 100 rap hooks
And sociological books, while you worried about your looks
Now you wanna enter the dragon in sound
But I've got the live club show locked down
Platinum and gold don't hold in my arena
You gots to keep it real on the mic, when they see ya
I manifest, in the West, the East and overseas
Division in rap is wack, and I don't know of these
I represent New York to be specific
The South Bronx, but in Japan I'm still gifted
I grab a jet and land on your set, what the fuck?
Twenty bucks for a rap show is still, twenty bucks
I start from '86, and bring you into '96
No gimmicks, tricks or lip-sync lyrics

[Chorus]
De automatic, get de automatic
Disrespect, from MC's, me nah go have it
De automatic, get de automatic
Tonight a rapper gwan die

[Outro: Fat Joe]
Yeah yeah it's the God Fat Joe
Representin the motherfuckin South Bronx
With my nigga Kris, knockin off frauds
Motherfuckers wanna do what?
Big shout out to my nigga Kenny Parker
Ill Will, BDP crew for life nigga
Naughty Gotto, the Big French productions
Of course the TAT crew, my nigga Brim
The T.S. crew, and the whole Godsville
South Bronx represent nigga, uhh
The South Bronx, the South South Bronx
South Bronx, the South South Bronx
Yeah! Uhh!

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
I'm bringing back the style that others have pushed to the rear
Now you see me, now you don't, now I'm everywhere
Maybe you can see that knowledge does reign supreme
Rap is like a ballclub and I coach the team
Move the crowd, that's what MC mean
How many albums I got? Mmmm...12, 13
I've told y'all before
You are not just doin' hip-hop, you are hip-hop
Them jokers need to stop, be hip-hop
I mastered this and him, her, they, them, that one
She and he did not
I speak a lot, I hit 'em in they weakest spot
Come see me rock, yo, you'll leave in shock
KRS, you ever wonder why he's so hot?
It's because he's not pop yo, he's hip-hop
West to East the sound of the police will rock
If you don't love this you won't have the heat I got
Discipline, if you're listenin, defeats the COPS
Fuck the dumb shit yo, we gotta teach the tots
They say I preach a lot
And last year the took the jeep and shot
But this year the beat will knock

[Hook x2: KRS-One]
I know where
We can go
To see how a real MC flow
No video
No radio
Just a live show
C'mon now you gon' go?

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
I'm still standing, demanding playing my lex jammin'
Cats wanna really see me start blam-blammin'
Put away the cannon for this overstandin'
I'm landin'
Let the music play like Shannon
I'm so hot, why not, I bring all the fans in
Watch me now come alive like Peter Frampton
Listen to me people, listen to me loud and clear
It's time I found out what type of people up in here
When I shout out the classic if you know it say yeah
South Bronx-Yeah!
My Philosophy-Yeah!
Black Cop-Yeah!
You Must Learn-Yeah!
Yeah we gonna do it up in here
I'm still standin'
And rappers be mad-mad
Cause they know they'll give birth like the American
Flag in Baghdad
All they do is blab-blab, that head chatter
Why the dopest MC always a dead rapper?
I'm a real live rapper, I'm out to set it
I pay dues, while your crews still on credit
You talk that shit till I come out the school
And all y'all sound like Trina sayin' "That's Cool"
Time for the streets again
Time for them cats to pop gats into the mic you speakin' in
I'm creepin' in with a hundred soldiers
When I step on the stage it's over

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: KRS-One]
They don't play me a lot
KRS you don't see a lot
On TV a lot, but I do MC a lot
I don't duck and hide when I see the cops
I'm free with the knowledge to free the block
Live on the radio I'm sendin' my rhyme, you can see
I'm behind enemy lines
You already heard about plenty of crime
Now hear about the sciences that could really open ya mind
I only got a little bit of time to rhyme before the
Producer over here says "Ok, that's fine"
So let's get to it, I got my whole squad with me
On top'a all that I got God with me
You can go far with me
From New York, to Atlanta, to LA
You know they all with me
You might not see me on this station cause this is a
Rapcity and KRS leads a Hip-Hop nation
Even though y'all chase ends
Why can't weeeeee be friends, it all depends
Cats wanna thug it out
Isn't it true that Hip-Hop was bigger when we all loved it out?
Look at the difference in raps
See when I'm spittin' the facts
Louder than anyone could rap, the industry collapse
No one's special anymore
Variety is gone for sure

[Hook x2]

[Intro]
Knowledge, where the people at?
Free Mumia!
Channel Live! (KRS-One, come and represent)
(The wisdom)
Hah hah hah hah hah hahaha!
Free Mumia!

Everywhere I look there's another house negro
Talkin about they people and how they should be equal
They talkin but the conversation ain't goin nowhere
You can't diss hip-hop, so don't you even go there
C. Delores Tucker, you wanna quote the scripture
Everytime you hear nigga, listen up sista

[Verse 1: Hakim, KRS, Tuffy]
I met up with this girl named Delores, a prankster
I said I MC, she said, "You're a gangster"
But she was caught up, she hit the floor like a breakdance
Wrapped her up like the arms in a b-boy stance
Recognize moms I'm one of your sons I'm hip-hop
In the form of Channel Live and KRS-One
Representin MC's across America
She said, "You're the one who be causin all that mass hysteria"
Wisdom shall come out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
But you blinded by cultural ignorance and steady judging
But judge not, lest ye may be judged
For the judgment ye judge ye shall surely be judged, you gets no love

She said, "I like it, that's why I jock it"
Then I said, "You only on my back because I fill brother's pockets"
Got em drivin Benzes Jeeps and Rolls Royces
Attackin me will leave youth with no voices
The choice is yours not mine hang with me
I'll have you freestyle and bombin graffiti
We can cut it up like like wax
Claimin I cause violence but America was violent before rap, FACT

[Chorus: KRS-One]
Warner, Elektra, Atlantic equals WEA
Instead of fighting them why don't you go free Mumia
(repeat 2X)

[Verse 2: Tuffy, KRS, Hakim]
Wild recital, I kicks the vital, like The Final Call
As I watch, Babylon fall
I had to Rush Limbaugh, hit that pig with an axe
Tuffy dips to the side, buckin cannons that's phat
Because he censors the usage of the metaphor
You can get the tip of my dick Gore
Because it's you that brings the, real horrorcore
Expenditures be gettin, cut from the poor
Why sure! Back before we were born they sold us out
Yeah J. Jackson we know what you about
Youse a Slave Mason, not a Free Mason
Before long the Goddess Tiamat through hip-hop you'll be facin
Don't start me, cause I be the, lyricist
At the nineteen ninety-nine millenium party held at Giza
Sayin he's a, fraud, oh my Goddess
Never in your life should you disrespect an artist
Instead, focus your attention on astronomy
And the up and coming, shift in the economy
If you can't do that, then heed the final call
To free Mumia, Abu-Jamal

Hate to be so rough, it could be the White Owls
House niggas are full of crap, like my Colin Powell
Kickin vowels, is how we relieve the tension
Until we start to bounce white people like suspension (revolution)
You paint the pictures, the black man on the corner
But tell me, who blew up Oklahoma?
The City, ain't no pity, for the beast
It's Hakim that voice from the East

[Chorus]
Warner, Elektra, Atlantic equals WEA
Instead of fighting them why don't you go free Mumia
(repeat 2X)

[Verse 3: KRS, Hakim, Tuffy]
Buck buck! Buck buck buck!
It sound like gunshots but it could be the cluck
Of a chicken, definition, is what you're missin and
Listen to your children instead of dissin em
Senator Dole doesn't understand the younger
Like they be sayin want to, but we be sayin wanna
They gettin dumber every summer as they walk the raod
Maybe because they cannot understand the code

Word, in actuality, this Norman Bates mentality
Always seems to represent, minus three-sixty percent
Or degrees full circle, dead from the purple
Rays of the sun I gots melanin so check it
Bag your nuts quick or get sick from being naked
Suspect it, was it a means for the end
For just a few to drive the Benz while you eat the pigskins
Turned you into mannequins, cause the trick of technology
A revelation, revalations
Sensation gives me inspiration of revolution
That's my solution, there will be no sequels
I'm audi hundred forty four thousand with my people

From Caligula to Hitler, now it's Schwarzenegger
A lust for the violence is the science of their behavior
Who enslaved ya (it's the Devil) but the God of virtuosity
And of the world created, could it be mental sodomy
Got my mind twisted like the blades of fonta leaf
I sit in disbelief as he crawls underneath
The rock cock back the Glock, cause I don't trust
The Devil I rebel until Babylon is dust

[Chorus]
Warner, Elektra, Atlantic equals WEA
Instead of fighting them why don't you go free Mumia
(repeat 2X)
* train whistle *
Yo right here, right here
It's right through the fence, right through the fence

All graffiti artists hold tight, hooo!
All graffiti artists hold tight, word
Check check check it out y'all
Check check check check check it out y'all

[KRS-One]
I got twenty-five cans in my knapsack, crossin out the wick-wack
Puttin up my name with a fat cap
Suckers that want to be in my face I just slap that
Big respect to Artifacts, Fat Joey Crack and
Mack and, Bio, and Brim come again
With B.G. 183, recognize me
With the mad colors, I'm a fiend for spraypaint
Laugh if you wanna, I really care if you ain't
Cause you don't me see, and I don't know you
But I do know Cope2, he be hittin' walls too
It's the underground community of what we call writers
Worldwide burners, gettin hotter gettin brighter
Whattup Nicer, whattup Razor, whattup Chino
Masta Ace in the place, with the bass
You know we know
My man Rican, my man Zorro, taught me how to draw
In the yards of the 5 train and the 4
So when I'm on tour I represent the hardcore
I'm taggin up your blackbook sure, I'm out for the fame

"I'm writin my name, in graffiti on the wall" (repeat 4X)
* first time, minus "I'm" *
Yeah, check it out check it out check it out one time
Hip-hop music in effect one time

[KRS-One]
When I was growin up, I had no butcher baker candlestick maker
I had rubbing alcohol and carbon paper
Yeah, carbon paper and a blackboard eraser
Got me chased in the bus yards, with Rican and Nazer
Historically speakin, cause people be dissin
The first graffiti artists in the world were the Egyptians
Writing on the walls, mixing characters with letters
To tell the graphic story about their life, however
Today we do the same thing, with how we rap and draw
We call it hardcore, they call it breakin the law
There used to be a time when rap music was illegal
The cops would come and break up every party when they see you
But now the rap music's making money for the corporate
It's acceptable to flaunt it, now everybody's on it
Graffiti isn't corporate so it gets no respect
Hasn't made a billion dollars for some corporation yet, so
In the name of Phase2, Stay High, Presweet
Grab your cans and hit the streets, I'm out for fame

"I'm writin my name, in graffiti on the wall" (repeat 6X)
Yeah, hip-hop culture in the house one time
All graffiti artists in the house one time
Yeah..
Biggin up the other side things here y'all
The visual, not your video (check it out)

[KRS-One]
I'm livin in the city, inner city not a farm
Steady bombin til I get fatigue in my arm
Watchin for the beast cause many artists they shot em
And beat em in the yards, while doin a top to bottom
So pass me a can, not of Old Gold
But full blue, sky blue, watch me unfold
With the cold burner, of names you mighta heard of
Like Fab 5 Freddy, Sam Sever
Word to the wise, Futura 2000 recognize
Nation of creation, G Man come alive
Checkin out Revolt and Zephyr
My man Easy, and Rembrandt, Mitch 77
Oh no with the paint we can never dilly-dally
Big up and respect to Con Art in Cali
The Soul Artists, The Rebels, The Rascals, 3YB
United Artists, TAT and Dondi
Yes the other side of hip-hop is representin the visual
Toys we be dissin' you, I'm out for fame

"I'm writin my name, in graffiti on the wall" (repeat 10X)
Hip-hop in the house one time
Video graf in the house one time
All graffiti artists in the house dig the rhyme
Put up your nine, put up your nine, yeah!

Fresh... for nineteen-ninety-five
You SUCKERS!

[Produced by KRS-ONE]

[Verse 1]
I'm thinkin' real hard about some money I can hold
But everybody I know is deep in the hole
A steady payin' job is too hard for me to hold
I call around for work but they puttin' me on hold
But in my hand a shiny .45 is what I hold
I make a mayonnaise sandwich out of some whole-
Wheat, I'm feelin' weak, I can't hold
I gotta rob somebody tonight and take the whole
Bank roll, some cash I gotta hold
At the bottom of my shoe is a little bitty hole
That's it, my mental sanity I can't hold
I'm walkin' to the store with this pistol that I hold...

[Verse 2]
Half of me is sayin' maintain and uphold
Suddenly I bump into some asshole
He's cursin' me out, but this pistol that I hold
Took control, and in his head I put a hole
Ahhh man, now I'm lookin' around the whole
Area, the gun is still hot that I hold
I'm buggin' out, and I don't know how much longer I can hold
I feel myself sinkin' deeper in the hole
So in my victim's pants I rip a little hole
And felt for the wallet, and took the whole
Bill-fold, forty bucks is what I hold
Suddenly I hear, "Freeze! Police! Hold!"

[Verse 3]
In the penitentiary I see a whole
Bunch of blacks and Hispanics that they hold
In my cell I cry like hell, my head I hold
One day somebody ax if my shoes they could hold
I told this guy, "Listen! My shoe's got a hole
But what's up with that shiny sharp knife that you hold?"
He lunged forth, the first thing that I thought of was to hold
The arm with the knife so that he couldn't put a hole
In me, but then I put him in a chokehold
Took the knife and in his neck I put a hole
Suddenly all the C.O's come to me and it's me they hold
Beat my ass and I spend two weeks in the hole
I'm ready to bug out, my sanity I can't hold
My needs and wants messed up my life on a whole
(Damn, just wasn't satisfied with life)

[Outro]
The moral to the story is...
Your addiction to your needs and your wants
Is what causes problems in your life
Make sure you got what you need
Put at a safe distance all the things that you want
It's wants that get you into trouble
This is the balance of life
The balance to life on a whole
Hah, respect!
All crew, all massive, everywhere in the world
You practice the art of hip-hop
This goes out to every boy and every girl

Give me relief! I sing!

Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us! I sing!
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us!

Check it
All beef can be squashed if you want it
But instead of forgiveness, ego you flaunt it
Everybody gets into two or three quarrels
Leadin to a squabble, someone will die tomorrow
Life is not a thing you can borrow
All beefs don't have to lead to sorrow
Will ya, go out tomorrow
I think, you should think about the beef you got
And confront your enemy before it gets too hot
Never feel ashamed, to say, "Yo G I'm sorry
I apologize," the object is to stay alive
I never ran from the Klu Klux Klan
And I shouldn't have to run from a black man

(a group says it together)
I never ran from the Klu Klux Klan
And I shouldn't have to run from a black man

Yeah!
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us! I sing!
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us!

He said she said, but she said she didn't
Face gets hit, and then, bullets start spittin
No one's admittin to their wrong doing, unfittin
Revenge we're pursuin, look at what you're doin, LISTEN
Release the karma that you're carryin'
Be a mental vegetarian indulge in no beefs, like the
Fish in the aquarium, you'll enjoy it while you're tryin it
There is no seperation between the mind and the environment
Like a bolt of lightning
I'm givin 5000 volts of the occult while I'm writin and recitin
I've come to enlighten black and white to the meaningless fightin
Clash of the titans ain't right
And it's wrong so the song reflects
For too long we've been vexed at each other
Every sister, every brother..
You've gots ta LOVE one another
I never ran from the Klu Klux Klan
And I shouldn't have to run from a black man

(a group says it together)
I never ran from the Klu Klux Klan
And I shouldn't have to run from a black man

Yeah!
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us! Check it
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us! Ha hah

Give me relief! (That's right)
Squash all beef!

If I ruled the schools, from pole to pole
The entire judicial system would fold
I would get rid of the books cause they bogus
And in school, Knowledge of Self would be the focus
Kids would flock to the schools like locusts
Cause school now relates to them, and you would notice
Violence in society would be a minimal
Cause the education yeah, would now be metaphysical
Not livin by laws, but livin by principal
If you disobey, the UNIVERSE gets with you
We would study giving so no one would steal
And we would read each other's magnetic fields
Petty crimes times petty crimes
Equals prison for lifetimes
The universe divided by two
Equals me and you
Me and you, go into the universe once
Or as one united front
But listen up, when I was growin up in hip-hoppin
We had a thing called Jailhouse Boxin
That's why I'm STILL here rockin
Cause my competition never pulled a Glock in, yeah
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us! I sing!
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us! Yeah!
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us! I sing!
Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us!

Whattup Sadat X?
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth

"These are the streets!
Shit is real out here!
This ain't no fuckin joke!"

I lived in a spot called Millbrooke Projects
The original Criminal Minded rap topic
With twenty cents in my pocket I saw the light
If you're young, gifted, and black, you got no rights
Your only true right, is a right to a fight
And not a fair fight, I wake up wonderin who died last night
Everyone and everything is at war
Makin my poetic expression hardcore
I ain't afraid to say it, and many can't get with it
At times in my life, I was a welfare recipient
I ate the free cheese, while the church said believe
And went to school everyday, like a god damn fool
Well anyway, here I am, chillin at the party
Brothers lookin at me like they wanna kill somebody
A cypher manifested in the center of the jam
I got to show these wack rappers really who I am
It's me against them, so I clear the phlegm
And wage the war, hardcore to the end
For someone lookin inside, yeah from the out
It seems like disrespect is what rap is all about
But hip-hop as a culture, is really what we give it
But sometimes the culture contradicts how we live it
Cause every black kid lives two and three lives
The city's a jungle, only the strong will survive
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth

Every single day I hear lie after lie
Like "Black people don't die, we multiply"
So when I kick a rhyme I represent how I feel
The sacred street art of keepin it real
Why I gotta listen, to somebody else?
How they got wealth, let me talk about myself
But all I really got is hip-hop and a Glock
The results are obvious, if I'm confined to my block
Occasionally, in the city I'm released
To meet other beasts, lookin for the feast
We grunt and growl, on the prowl, as the air gets thinner
"Yo yo there he go, him," there's the dinner
White meat, carryin a bag of some sort
Life is short, white meat is quickly caught
A scuffle a muffle yet none of us hesitated
Like Mother Africa, white meat is violated
We quickly disappear, like Santa's little elves
And go into a area to fight amongst ourselves
We say, "peace/piece" cause that's what we really want
A piece of the pie that America flaunts
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth

"Oh shit!"

The truth is that police must serve and protect
REALITY is black youth is shown no respect
The truth is government has a war against drugs
REALITY is government is ruled by thugs
With all this technology, above and under
Humanity still hunts down one another
Rappers display artistic cannibalism
Through lyricism, we fight each other over rhythm
Through basic animal instincts, we think
So the battle for mental territory is glory, end of story

Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
Yeah

"These are the streets!
Shit is real out here!
This ain't no fuckin joke!"
It's not natural If it goes against God
It's not factual Her truth is not hard
It's not natural If it goes against God
It's not factual Gimme the truth!

Listen to the lyric as the negative is shrinkin
It's shrinkin out your life when you decide to change your thinkin
One of the first things we gotta switch around of course
Is Jesus Christ, and him dying on the cross
You're looking at the cross, surrounded in it's mystery
With Jesus on the cross in a, total misery
Now seperate Jesus from the cross so you can see
The truth about the cross, and the cross's history
The cross was created by the Roman government
It's only purpose and use, is cap-i-tal punishment
But Jesus Christ, was all about the revolution
While the cross was used as Jesus Christ's execution
See what if Jesus Christ, was hung upon a tree
Upon every church wall, that's exactly what you'd see
If Jesus Christ, was shot in the head with no respect
We'd all have little gold guns around our neck
If Jesus Christ was killed in electic chair, now get it
You'd be knealing to the electric chair with Jesus, still in it
You gaze upon the cross, and you see the execution
You yell stop the violence but the cross you're still using
It's not natural If it goes against God
It's not factual Her truth is not hard
It's not natural If it goes against God
It's not factual Gimme the truth!

So I say listen, listen, open up your third eye vision
God is not down with religion
Religion they be sellin it, listen up, God is intelligent
Reading of the bible is irrelevant
You gotta look within yourself, not a scripture
KRS-One comes to rearrange the God picture
If you sit and believe, you can acheive
If you sit and accept, you don't know, what's correct
Or incorrect, take for instance Adam and Eve
The first two people on the planet, or so you believe
Their first time in heaven kids they had, Cain and Abel
Huh, now let me show you why the story's unstable
According to the story, according to what you believe
There was only Cain, Abel, Adam, and Eve
On the whole planet, now use your intellect
And tell me, what did Cain and Abel do for sex?
Upon the whole planet there was not another
Could it be for sex, heh, they were looking at each other?
Hold up! I thought the church wasn't into that
But wait, still yet, there is another fact
How did the world get populated?
Now tell me if I'm wrong, but obviously Eve had it goin on
Think for a minute, I know it gets notorious
But yo G, check out the chorus
It's not natural If it goes against God
It's not factual Her truth is not hard
It's not natural If it goes against God
It's not factual Gimme the truth!

[Rich Nice]
Yo yo...
Yo bring that back
I wanna say something on this BlastMaster session
Yo this is Rich Nice
You brothers gotta stop treating these hoes like nice girls
And these nice girls like hoes

[KRS-One]
True indeed, I'd like to welcome the rebirth of the Goddess
Word up it's all about knowledge of self
Yo Busta Rhymes, why don't you take the session over from here

[KRS-One]
Yeah, turn my voice up
Yeah, you make the base bump, you know that
Yo Foxxx, what up man? You killed it on this shit

Listen to the track, this goes back
Stripped down, cats don't get down like this
But true revolutionaries get down like this
Street activists be surrounding Kris
I gets down, I don't just pound my fist
Greedy executives, y'all can like drown in piss
Cause raw Hip Hop, man it sounds like this
I got pounds of this, I spit rounds of this
Man pass me the mic, I go to town on this
Walk out with a cap and gown on Kris
Cause I graduate, man I'm glad they hate this
I float cause I never hesitate, I'm wait-less
Some of y'all can't take this
I'm like the ocean, you what a lake is
Yo, who wanna "rhyme on"?
You cats backing up
When the Blastmaster KRS start acting up
Yeah that gat be up, six-five, I strut with two legs
I see the top of all of you's heads
And that's symbolic of Hip Hop
It's like a jungle sometimes and we like the treetops
Cause when I always spit fly, and rappers get sprayed
I always was taught man, never to be afraid
Who wanna "rhyme on"?
Always spit fly and never be afraid, I'm timeless
We the plus man, they the minus
Nothing sounds like us
These rappers are starting to sound like the black versions of Imus
Me? I'm Akhenaten and writing on papyrus
We old school, don't try us
Let me ask, who wanna "rhyme on"?
Let me get this rhyme on, let me turn my sign on
These lyrics will shine on
If this ain't Hip Hop then I'm wrong
And I'mma be wrong, cause this is it
I take it all the way back to the boom, the boom, the bip
KRS-One, who's gonna jump on this?

[Chorus 2X: Vocalist] + (KRS-One)
I know that you don't like
Things that I like
But just because I write
The things that'll take your mind to sky-high
(I write about life, I write about death
I write about strife, I write about stress
I write about the strong and the weak
I write about the hood and the street
I rhyme about my beefs)

[KRS-One]
Okay, here I go with a flow that be thumping the show
It's the Teacha KRS-One if you didn't know
Man I speak to the streets over beats every week
Forget crime, peace of mind, that's what you seek
Man I'm back with the heat, I keep rapping
Cause when people look at hip-hop today, they be like "What happened?"
Here's what happened, one side is chilling
The other side, they already sold out their children
They want millions, forget nation building
If this was really the mob, we would've took them out and killed them
But this the Gospel, we fulfil 'em
I'm Hip Hop, I'm good, I'm omni hood, Kris rocks every block
Rise up, the lights up when I'm up
Challengers, you know exactly where you wind up
This the hand that fed you, I don't hate y'all
Some of y'all make me sick, it's more like a "hetchoo"
I bring life to your dead crew
My real name is love, and love's gonna get you
I got the TEC too, but it ain't about the TEC
It's about whether the owner of the TEC respects you

[Chorus]

[KRS-One]
What you wanna hear bout central booking for?
Hip Hop, that's exactly what you looking for
If you don't represent the name, what you took it for?
I spit rhymes so raw, you need to cook it more
I'm from the Wild Style, Beat Street breaking
Nope, you're not the king, that seat's been taken
You young'ns on some crazy shit
Me, retire? Why dude, I made this shit!
So yo, get to spitting, freestyling or written
The clock is ticking, stroke your kit and you'll get broken and bitten
Ain't no coke in my kitchen
I got that fish, wheat, bread and chicken, y'all leave limping
I put out more cartoons than the Simpsons
You got them sucker emcee symptoms, look around
You don't even know your english, your verb or noun
You just a sucker emcee, you sad-faced clown

[Chorus]

[KRS-One]
Time to clear out the bullshit!
We ain't gon' never give up this type of sound
Time to clear out the bullshit!
I know what y'all, what y'all after

We ain't never leaving this space right here!
This is what it is
When we took the vow "I am Hip Hop"
This is what we swore to defend, this

Welcome to the Lyrical Ass Beating
I'm not in a mansion or a yacht
I'm right on your black man speaking, I keep teaching
Cats be like "How he still eating?"
Cause I build on skills that never weaken
I ripped a club just last weekend
Y'all sitting around playing XBox and internet freaking
Then you want to get what I got? You want to get in my spot?
You want to click, click and hold on my Glock?
Nah player get your own pistol
My arms become dealers when I'm holding up that mic missile
Stay back with your rap, it might clip you
I use smart mics, my words will hit you
As you can see I'm much realer
When the mic weapon is in my arm, I become that rap arms dealer
So who da best? Who da best out here?
Who claiming the crown when KRS out here
Who da best motherfucker today? My fans are here to stay
Sixteen albums, not one of my producers were fake
Who da freshest motherfucker in rap?
You better dig in your crates, who lives what they state?
Who's the most consistent to date?
If you're talking 2Pac or B.I.G. you late (KRS!!)
I ain't got a Maybach but I takes it way back
Knowledge reigns supreme, watch how you say that
I slept where the World Trade at
Right at ground zero's where my head laid at
New York is where I'm raised at
When it comes to Hip-Hop, we made that
We can never trade that, for any payback
Yo, JS! Where the real DJs at?

[Intro]
"One two, testing one two
Alright party people in the place to be
The party has already started
An-an-an-and it's about to il-il-il-ill *echoes*"

[Verse 1]
Let me introduce you to another type of rapper MC
Where glamour and glitter don't matter gently
I'm tired of the Chattanooga empty
Classical like a German luger
Deep like a tune for scuba diving who am I the hyper
Like I said before my radar's going BIBBIT BIBBIT
The microphone I grip-it grip-it, lyric lyric I live it
Hear it my spirit is where it should be
Don't push me if you pussy, HUH
I spot em, it seems you want to ride the dillz
I got em, KRS got skills in the place
I waste megahertz of bass bottom, chill
As I rock em and get ill, I build the perfect spot to kill
Verbal excitement will lead to your indictment
Whether or not you like it, still, number one I hype it
Your album, rewrite it

[Hook]
How many MCs, wannabemceez
Never be MCs, cause they can't MC
How many MCs, wannabemceez
Never be MCs, cause they can't MC

[Verse 2]
Triplet syllables for minimal criminals
Lyrical riddles that got hard flavors in the middle
Sit back and chittle as I stand and still rebuild on skills
The admission of serial lyrics, calculated to weaken the spirit
Will be diverted by this lyric when you hear it
Ricochet any style any day
Any which way and you'll Cherish the Day like Sade
The advanced oratorical techniques I speak
Keep the heat at full peak! My grammar
With stamina, grabs a rapper like the fresh catch of the day
And crack the back of that DJ
I'm strappin and attackin a pack
And whatever happens after that just happens, FACT
Flamboyant and flashy is one point in time when you're not ashy
Focus on the syllable formats and the cash G
G for guard your grill, I'm hard to kill
Odd but ill, a job to fill is to refill on skills
We built and killed style and skill
While poetically recriminate you like a child I will
Get ill, and switch to earn
Cause I prefer to slur but not blur
Blurring you're stirring up trouble surely you don't need it
Be seated I'm undefeated dem not see it
Observe me then beat it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Let's get back to the point quickly, get with me
The voice from New York City is too witty
I come from a era of ?OJ cars?, Latin Quarter
Fake Gucci and fake Fendi, you can't send me
Nowhere, that I ain't been to
You can't tell me nuttin that I ain't been through
Disrespect the teacher I gots to get you
*cause they can't MC*
But what you really sayin
You sound like a bitch-ass rapper when he's saying
"Yo Kris you hit too hard" stop playing!
Switching and swaying
Day in and day out, your styles are played out, see you way out
Before you're laid out, your bright lights start to fade out
The last thing you heard is "Who let the K out?"
No grey area
Everything is black and white we took the gray out its scarier
Either you're winnin or losin, spinnin the rules of conscience
But lyrically there ain't no stoppin
I'm droppin a lot in your noggin
Cause I know that you're lyrically starvin
Carbon, your name, battle battle
Everybody wants to battle but you BAB-BLE
Who knows ya, battlin me, is the only way that you can gain exposure
I feel for ya soldier
I hate to say it but I told ya so
You know that I know the ancient flow KRS-One
Is the holder of a boulder yo, money folder yo
You want a fresh style let me show you slow
Your blow, I'm not your foe
Battling me? No no no no no no NO!

[Hook]

[Mad Lion: Outro]
If a DJ think he man den he better prepare for war!!
BDP crew get up in that ass like a piece of toilet tissue
General Lion I chase them all and I am on fiyah
Represent the hardest crew, you know how we do
Anything tess, dead! Gun shot to dem head
Gwan *echoes*

[Intro]
Bling Blung
KRS-One
Yeah, Word Up
Yeah
Yo

[Hook]
Bling blung, bling blung, First you see the bling
Then you feel the blung
This is the way that the world is run
Can't you tell
Bling blung rock the bells

[KRS-One: Verse 1]
Move along, move along, along, this is a newa song
KRS-One the supa strong
Move along before you lose your tongue
Before you lose ya lung
Be sure MCs get done
Detour or move along
We teach the young
How many young men hung so we could sing a song?
You need to move along, along, along
The string of injustice stung those that bling cause now they blung
Materialism stings and now they stung
You need to move along
Life is like ding, dong, ying, yang, bing, bang, ping, pong, or ping, pong
Any lyrical battle we won
Yes, this a master flow, this how life go on
First you got it then your gone
So don't get stung
Cause after the bling it's blung
No material thing stays with you long

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Move along, along, we can't get stung
We the one, my melanin stuns right up in the sun
I go and I come, don't mind me son
I'm just a teacher, them cats should't try me son
I'm that lively one
I roll with them grimey ones
At the Temple (of Hip Hop) you can find me son
What I bring and sing reflects what I brung
I be rolling, aling off the tongue
You can check them other ones
Maybe them younger ones
But I be that I witness just like Connie Chung
Some burn the paper
Some burn the bong
I'm burning rappers, I think you need to move along!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Move along you little singers
Never linger round a rhyme bringer
These rap blingers
I break you off a middle finger
Bell ringa, in your mind a dong dinga
Yo, that's what's wrong with these singas
When they sing all they bring is bling
THEY DUMMIES
But after the bling aling, aling is blung
Post bling is blung
A new ting son
I'm rockin these bells like ding dong
As you can see I got no rings on
Cause it got nothing to with what springs song
So ding dong
Open the door to freedom
Any of my books you should read dum and be strong
Or else you need to move along, along, along
Your lyrics are cow dung
There use to be a TV talent show with a gong
And when the gong gonged you were gone
Yes I am the lyrical Don
Beats for art um
But I am unattched to all of thum
The message of the song is bling blung
Don't get caught up in watcha bought up
Be Strong

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
That's right
Up and down, up and down we go
Beatminerz on the track, I'm conducting the flow
Reverse flow, you get wolf if you didn't know
Either way when I play I'm a beast at the show
Like yeast I will grow, to the East I'mma go
And increase what I know, bring relief to my bro
I keep in the dough, but my feast I don't show
I keep on the low and I reap what I sow
When it's time for the concert I creep in the show
Sometimes I walk in off the street to the show
Grab the microphone, bring the heat to the show
Hip Hop, I teach it if you're seeking to know
The introduction to the course is perceive what you know
When Hip Hop is what you perceive, leave, you can go
Others make rap but they don't need what you know
You a divine speaker, what you need is to grow
Believe me, I know, I see how it go
All the doors are shut till you reaching for dough
But if everything's for sale then he is a ho
And if everything's for sale then she is a ho
I do things freely, I don't believe in the dough

[Verse 2]
Up and down, up and down we go
Mr. Walt, Evil Dee, KRS on the flow
Any time, any place—rhymes ready to go
Edutainment from the pavement, man you already know
Never starving, we go, never crawling for dough
We that orthodox Hip Hop that all of you know
Man I lived through the ballers, they ain't balling no mo'
The arenas, the theaters ain't calling no mo'
The budgets from the labels ain't falling no mo'
Them big gold cables are pawned at the sto'
Them cats now thinkin', "Yo, what was it all for?"
Twenty platinum plaques, you still can't tour
All over the radio, you still can't draw
Now listen back to your lyrics, what was that all for?
When you had the opportunity you could've spit it raw
But instead wanted head from the lips of all these whores
Now you fifty-four and you don't spit it no more
Your jams in the clubs, they don't rip it no more
Head in the bed, you don't get it no more
Now you starting to think, "What I'm livin' for?"
That's when you see KRS is on tour
After a two-hour show, he's spitting one more!

[Verse 3]
Yo, let me show you what a legend is
I rhyme as KRS; Krazy Rhyme Stylist
You better keep your eye on this, ain't none higher than this
These clubs don't stop hiring Kris
Time for the light to shine
Too many rappers rapping and they even fight for the right to rhyme
I'm nice with mine, I'm precise with mine
As you can see I don't need ice to rhyme
You a biter, I don't even like your kind
The rhyme you spitting now might be mine
Yo, what they doing here if they don't like to rhyme?
{*knocking*}

[KRS-One]
Come in {*door opens*} sit down
Yeah...
I have a magical mind, a magical body
Ancient metaphysician, you better AX somebody
With one handshake, I can tell if your plan's fake
I am to hip-hop, what flour is to pancakes
I write rhymes 'til my hand aches
In the mountains of Colorado, takin in the landscape
When I'm in the city I can't wait to live again
In the underground hot springs of the Hopi Indians

So you look around your heart and your mind
You will find, I am there
If you're cold and you're broke and there's fog in your scope
Have hope, I am there
Get in tune with me, move with me, boom with me, room with me
Zoom with me, I am there
I can see where you're at, feelin trapped, can't move can't act
I was there
And it's quite clear
My hardware was set ahead of most folks by ten years
The hand of God set it, so on Earth I speak prophetic
Publishin papers with no edit
I speak but most don't get it, but the few that do get it
In their minds my words stay embedded
And they blessed if they don't forget it
They'll never need a psychiatrist, a psychic or a medic
Where we headed? To the ultimate state of freedom
That's where I'll lead 'em, if you let it I'll free 'em
Let's set it, for human beings in recreation
Havin fun recreatin themselves into a nation
Hip-Hop! It's home could never be a station
Sharin a space with R&B, stop fakin
Do you know how much money they makin offa you and I
Just because hip-hop won't unify?

So look inside your heart or your mind you will find
Everytime, I am there
If you're cold and you're broke and there's fog in your scope
Have hope! I am there
Get in tune with me, move with me, boom with me, room with me
Zoom with me, I am there
I can see where you're at, feelin trapped, can't move can't act
I was there

[KRS-One]
Yeah, my next piece goes out to you internet bitches
Hiding behind texts and shit

First of all, y'all don't really grab mics man
You be in the studio with the mic in the mic stand
On your knees you supposed to fall
I'm just superior clearly, I'm over y'all
When you stall, really, you call in dad
Talk hefty, I'mma put you in a garbage bag
All them theatrics be wack shit for sure
You the reason people don't like rap no more
You ain't fresh guy, I bought your CD
Listened to it and took that wack shit back to Best Buy
You'll need +TLC+ like Left-Eye
I'll smash him, him, you and your next guy
You'll be like "KRS why?"
When I come to your day job and hang you from your neck tie
Your whole shit's fake, your manager hyped you
Y'all like two bitches, kiss like dykes do

[Hook: Vocalist]
Yeah, how would ya like it if I rocked just a little bit?
Oh, how would ya like it if I ripped just a little bit?
If I spit just a little bit?
Rip mics just a little bit?
Light blunts just a little bit?
Tote guns just a little bit?

[KRS-One]
My name reigns supreme in every rap index
I'll spray your brains on the windowpane like Windex
You wearing fishnets, peep it
We not the same, I'm jeans and scully, you Victoria's Secret
You not on that street shit, you ain't getting skrilla
You rapping cause you a wack drug dealer
So what's it gonna be? Rapping or dealing?
You can't serve two gods, I'm capping and peeling
What happened? You kneeling, your legs got no feeling
Cause when the gun went under your chin, your brain hit the ceiling
We invented this shit, to them cops you be squealing
Your whole Marvin is Gay, you need Sexual Healing
Them cars I be wheeling, you dudes into stealing
From the weak, I'll leave you in the passenger seat
I'll teach a class in a week, bust yo ass in the street
We get more intelligent after I speak

[Hook: Vocalist]
Yeah, how would ya like it if I rocked just a little bit?
Oh, how would ya like it if I ripped just a little bit?

[KRS-One]
Yo, the Teacha KRS, I got Hip Hop on me
Before Hip Hop, a lotta y'all dudes was corny
You thug? I don't really see it B
I remember when all y'all was dressing like Run-D.M.C
But actually it was your parents, they were fans
You a fan, it's apparent, you're all transparent
See-through, I would never be you
You rap but really, really nobody believes you
They just like the beats you do
In a real club I'm eating you, Glock greeting you
Peekaboo, I'm that Teacha who
Made an appointment for his bullets to meet with you
Are you available? They'll come around two-thirty
I'm with the clean-up crew, aren't you dirty?
You heard me, man I take your heart
When the show start, I show art like Mozart
I take you back to {?}, these rappers got no heart
They not shell shocked, they show shocked, huh
I rock spots with no cop
All in your face like Botox, you like your old pops
You ain't running no blocks
Y'all dudes is corny, chasing ice and cream like Mister Softee
Get off me, your shit is wack man, you lost me

[Hook: Vocalist]
Yeah, how would ya like it if I rocked just a little bit?
Oh, how would ya like it if I ripped just a little bit?
If I spit just a little bit?
Rip mics just a little bit?
Light blunts just a little bit?
Tote guns just a little bit?
{*cut and scratched: "Life"*}

[KRS-One]
With every breath I breathe I choose life for the children
With every breath I breathe I choose a wife and good livin
With every single breath that I ingest I am given
A smidgen to make life-changin decisions, listen
My mission with precision will position our children
By the millions to start buildin our culture for the billions
And trillions of people comin after us
If they doubt, they won't be as fast as us
Cause in our time we kick a new power rhyme
We keep renewin your mind, cause soon you will find
That every single breath that I breathe keeps us conscious
Enough to perceive and achieve if you believe
But oxygen comes from the trees
Without air for four minutes forget it you catchin some Z's
So which is really conscious, us or nature?
Maybe the trees wish to elevate the paper
And maybe this was just the fall
To forget that nature thinks, we doin nothin at all
And this is the way of the world
The world meanin the conscious nature and the earth that swirls
Like buffalo girls we go 'round the outside
Kris is controversial but Kris never lied
In the forest, the mountains and the hills I reside
You gotta follow the purpose you feel inside
{*cut and scratched: "Life"*}

[KRS-One]
With every single breath I choose
With every single breath I move
With every single breath I prove
With every single breath I use
With every single breath I snooze
With every single breath I cruise
With every single breath I choose life
Not strife
Or strain, some like that I came, to rearrange the game
Others blame and remain the same
Same same, but me the plan is plain
We gotta think more humane...

[Intro]
Class gather round right now, the session ain't over
Salaam {?} provide the beat
Uh, I think this will do
Gather round, yeah

[Verse 1]
You don't need to be stressing, you don't need to be guessing
The Obama Deception, that was just one lesson
The military got all kind of weapons
And most of them are pointed at us from different directions
You looking for the same look
You protesting they guns but you using they Facebook
Oh you don't get it yet?
The American military captured the world with the internet
You using military tools
And if you use these tools in school, you're in military school
Don't be fooled, man don't you realise
It's humanity that rules, God will not lose
It's not about what's outside of me
The question is what can you do without the use of technology
Can you sing, can you run, can you weave?
Can you draw, can you dance, can you perceive?
What do you believe?
Do you believe your world was ended on twenty-twelve at Christmas Eve?
Mind over matter, matter over mind
Where's the ladder? Either way we gon' climb
Up, up, up, up
Up, up, up, ho
Up, up, up, up
Up, up

I ain't finished yet, my skills ain't diminished yet
I'm that emcee that shows you how ill it get
Open your eye, tell me if you feel it yet
I hope you rely on your soul, did they steal it yet?
Well if they didn't, to you this was written
Get off the block before the Glock start ripping
(Intro)
When you least expect it
(This is just one style)

(Verse One)
We back up in this piece like yeast to bread
Underground you gotta find me like an Easter egg
No need to beg, I hit the club hard on the reg
While you check for CDs I'm sellin' books instead
I travel the country by car, by foot and leg
What's worse than being behind is being ahead
Prophetic visions of President Jeb
Five storms hit Florida on his head and nobody said
"What's the meaning of this? It's like God is dead"
In the minds of the people hanging onto a thread
You gotta go where your heart is led
I spit truth but some cats, they just got the hardest head
As you can see, I'm artist-led
I take it to the black, to the green, and to the darkest red
I write, recite and of course go off the head-top
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, man -- don't forget that
(Chorus)
KRS and I'm on the mic
(Class is in session, so you can stop guessin')
KRS and I'm on the mic
This is just one style
KRS and I'm on the mic
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
KRS and I'm on the mic
Listen

(Verse Two)
Here's the mission, plain and straight
We gotta nurture and develop what we create
Hip-hop is our activity on the planet
Today it's just an album; tomorrow they examine it
In the future, someone's crammin' fast
Cause they want at least a B in their hip-hop class
I ain't even askin' you how
If our ancestors built nations, why you ain't buildin' one now?
Technology is not civilization
Civilization is not about the tools that you're making
You have an opportunity, at a new start
Truly living hip-hop is a chance at a new park
You can play a new part: Develop new DVDs, new books, new art
Open new food marts with hip-hop food charts and food carts
Playing 2Pac while you shop (Do it)
What's the sense of being a recording artist
At a recording company for a year or two
If after the third or fourth year they can't even hire you?
In fact there is really nothing there for you
If your life is not a can of goo
Hip-hop is not a product; hip-hop is me and you
What I spit will see you through
I'm freein' you with knowledge of G-O-D in you
(Chorus)

(Verse Three)
Foot soldiers, let's go - we got this
The freedom to be really you that's what hip-hop is
What can we really do? Reach for the top, kid
Those that seek the bottom they shot stop and lock, kid
We the inevitable, most credible
And most are leaning back with the terrible squad
Here to beat knock hard, this is the real truth
Everything I spit be backed up with real proof
Welcome to the underground
Don't look for me in the mainstream, this is a whole 'nother sound
Sound set we rock music in the streets
In the schools and over the Internet
Feel it yet? You ain't hear me yet
You ain't really ready to get near me yet
Y'all fear and fret

(Chorus)

[KRS-One]
They slippin Duke

You slippin Duke, you trippin Duke
Rememeber you still livin in a corporate chicken coop
With a hundred other chickens yellin get that loot
Makin a hundred other chickens tryin to spit what's cute
But KRS spits the fruit
My words are not hollow, I'll lead you out the chicken suit
You slippin Duke, I got proof, spit truth in the club
So the colleges man, we get so loose
What's the use, you slippin Duke, how America great
When Iraq, had no nukes, now OOPS
Whatever happened to samples and loops?
The same thing that happened to organs and flutes, and real artists
Thank God for The Roots, the soldier that's home with his family
Support for the troops yeah, now let's start this
I've taught many groups, been through many suits
Teachin new recruits that can't take it back to hula hoops
I know we're on mute, stand up straight
I'm like Skywalker without the loot, you slippin Duke
{*scratch: "At 8 you're a sucker, at 7 a motherfucker"*}

[KRS-One]
YEAHH!
Talk your talk, degrade my character
Your remarks are amateur, the future laughs at ya
I got much stamina, and I know my facts
I am hip-hop, I don't speak for blacks
I speak for hip-hop's preservation, and only that
Peace love unity, I'm known for that
What's your hassle with me man, no man is ownin me
You just mad cause I lead hip-hop globally
Your hassle is that, I'm an international cat
You know in any debate, I'm smashin your crap
When it comes to hip-hop, you behind
Cause I've been organizin this politically since 1989
I stay selective, the objective peace of mind
I am hip-hop and so are you don't be so blind
Use the key next time, you know my roots
But listen dog you slippin Duke!

{*scratch: "You wanna hear a fresh rhyme, you'll come to the source"*}
{*scratch: "Stamp BDP on your head then you're off"*}
{*scratch: "At 8 you're a sucker, at 7 a motherfucker"*}
{*scratch: "Do not attempt to diss cause you're soft"*}

[KRS-One]
Y'know
There's a difference between dreamin, and visualizin
Which one are you doin?

[Verse 1]
Food gone up, gasoline up
Full-time employment passin me up
Bills pilin up, really this sucks
I need a couple bucks, really I'm stuck
Here comes a truck, pullin right up
It says Brinks, now I'm thinkin what's up
But nah, what I'm thinkin about, yo duck
20 30 40 shots at the truck
I'm duckin runnin jumpin lookin for what?
Some cover for this brother, everything's nuts
But yo, I can see some others with gats
Brinks firin, they firin back
Rat, ta-tat-ta-ta-tat-ta-ta, tat
Then I woke up...

[Verse 2]
Doctor help me out, what's this all about
What's this condition I gotta figure out
Am I really out, that I really doubt
Give me the remedy, what is the amount?
Whatever you tellin me sellin me compellin me
Yo the light in me ain't out
Anyway I enter cats remember
Knowledge I sent ya forever they shout
South Bronx, South Bronx
South Bronx, South Bronx
Then I woke up...

[Verse 3]
Well I guess I'm out on my own
With this condition it won't be long
Before for sure my little sanity's gone
I'm livin off of nuttin, losin my home
Kids in the street, wife alone
I want to sell this very microphone
But then my friend the light was shown
It came through my inner cellular phone
Get up and get out my spirit will shout
Commitment is what love is really about
No down and no out, just up and about
I think I'm gonna take the spiritual route
Then I woke up....

[Verse 4]
Then I realized I'm out of my purpose
Out of my purp', not doin my work
I went on a search, inside of myself
For true health, love awareness and wealth
I went to the Temple and opened my mental
I learned that I'm the cause of all that I been through
Your whole environment is really within you
Reach inside your heart and write a new menu
I'mma be the change that I want to see
Now I can see, that I'm really free
Everything is really always somethin else
Tell yourself a different story 'bout self
Do you have the courage to be you
All that talk, that you talk, is it really you?
Oh silly you, oh silly me
Your tongue is killin YOU, not killin me
I'm feelin free, to be, just what I wanna be
Easily, you see, cause I woke up...

[Verse 5]
When I woke up, my debt went down
My locks broke up, my rent went down
My stocks went up, my car sped up
My pockets swell up, my life I found
I'm not so fed up it's time to get up
A clear mind switched my life around
Now I can see where the help is at
The health love awareness and wealth is at
Cause I woke up...
Cause I woke up! I woke up!
When I woke up, I woke up
That's when I woke up

[Outro]
Play that back

[Intro]
YEAH! YEAH!
C'mon...
Let me tell you cats {get what I'm sayin}

[Hook]
Snitchin and squealin and the underhand dealin
That's how you get fucked up!!
Robbin and stealin like you ain't got feelings
That's how you get fucked up!!
Gettin head in the bed with another man's wife
That's how you get fucked up!!
You better always think twice how you're livin your life
That's how you get fucked up!!

[Verse 1]
People walk around just, in a daze and oblivious
To them demons that live in us
Who can you really trust
Is it them demons that got us schemin or is it really us?
People really fuss, and them guns really bust
Brothers dyin over silly stuff
Them streets can get really tough
They ain't playin man, you better {get what I'm sayin}

[Hook]
When you can't forgive and all you spit is negative
That's how you get fucked up!!
When you're dissin your elders and cheatin your relatives
That's how you get fucked up!!
Messin with a man's crib, kids or wife
That's how you get fucked up!!
You better think twice how you're livin your life, cause
That's how you get fucked up!!

[Verse 2]
Yo, I'm a true school cat, just a cool cool cat
Got security tellin these people to move back
I got two new tracks, somethin new from DAT's
Tunnel Rats with Proper and Triune in the back
I don't move with a pack, I move membership
Hip-Hop we livin it and what I'm doin is rap
But cats wanna talk that crap
'Til they see that I'm not playin, you better {get what I'm sayin}
Everyday more betrayin, more lyin, and from friends
More crime and more revenge - HUSH
Things are really rough; cause there's really no one out there
That I doubt that you can really trust
Them guns bust - how many hustlers gotta die
Go to jail for a fiend to get a rush?
From ashes to dust, that man of lust
Is decayin, you better {get what I'm sayin}

[Hook]
Talkin that crap behind another man's back
That's how you get fucked up!!
Spittin gossip and scandal and don't have facts
That's how you get fucked up!!
Bein caught in the hype, flashin off your ice
That's how you get fucked up!!
You better always think twice how you're livin your life cause
That's how you get fucked up!!

[Verse 3]
I'mma close it out, cause all my foes they doubt
I'm rollin out, they know what I'm all about
I don't roam about, I appear and shout
I wear 'em out, then we clear 'em out
I steer the route to where the end be at
Where the peace, where the love, where my friends be at
Where the jealous ones envy that
And they start betrayin, that's right you better {get what I'm sayin}

[Hook]
If you schemin a lot on what another man's got
That's how you get fucked up!!
Dreamin up a plot for another man's spot
That's how you get fucked up!!
If you live by the knife then you die by the knife
That's how you get fucked up!!
You better always think twice how you're livin your life cause
That's how you get fucked up!!
Flashin what you got cause you think it's cool
That's how you get fucked up!!
You better watch yourself cause when you ACT A FOOL
That's how you get fucked up!!
When you act like you better, treatin men like mice
That's how you get fucked up!!
You better always think twice how you're livin your life cause
That's how you get fucked up!! {get what I'm sayin}
.. {get what I'm sayin}

[KRS-One]
And away we go
With a crazy flow, oh!
All the ladies know
And they babies know, we pro
Deep in your mind
While I'm repeatin this rhyme, we glow
I'm teachin this time
That off-beat I speak of a rhyme, flow
They just too slow
If you keepin in time, let's go
That b-boy thang
How long you think we gonna hang, I don't know
My style is complex
I got next, indeed we close the show
Still kickin the truth
To the young black youth, we gotta grow
My message is broader
Hip-Hop's the true world order, see it!
Every son, every daughter
If you think you oughta hip-hop, be it
You can sit on the sideline
Or your mind you can free it!
I can rock for a long time
With more rhymes, cause hip-hop WE IT
Who's it, we don't use it
Or do it as music when we spit
That murder, that crime
Never furthered your mind but you, repeat it
Whatever rhyme goes against
Your inner purpose you must delete it
As you can see it
I'm the average MC and hip-hop we teach it
All over the world
This goes out to all b-boys and girls
WORLDWIDE! {hooo, hooo, hooo...}

[KRS-One]
Yeah, HUT HUT HUT HUT!
I know we ain't gettin soft, HUT HUT HUT HUT!
I know we ain't gettin soft, listen
FIYAH!

[Hook: KRS-One]
When you advertise in New York
You best to beware, oh yes
When you advertise in New York, you best to beware
Cause the bling bling, and de sex t'ing
Dem no care, oh no, you best to beware
Oh no, yo you best to beware, oh no noooo

[KRS-One]
This is how they do it kid, I thought you knew it kid
This is how they set us up listen I can prove it kid
Many don't understand, you see it's all a plan
To keep the black man a child like he's Peter Pan
You'll never see a man, a real black man
Until you see a man with control of his hands
And to control your hands means you control your mind
And to control your mind means you ain't commitin crimes
Man you smarter than that, goin to prison is whack
Even the people in prison know I'm spittin the facts
I'm gettin open, open the class up
Don't smoke crack it'll tear yo' ass up

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
Listen! We got our own problems here in the States
So you know I'm not pointin the finger BUT WAIT
This is somethin y'all got to see
Even the UN knows violence begins with poverty
When you ain't got no money, it's quicker to kill
It's human nature that's way the jails are filled
And the MILITARY? From the time you sign up
To kill your neighbor man it's a SIN already
And SIN meaning Selfish Inconsiderate Needs
Gimme what I want! I don't care who bleeds
These days people ready to steal and rob
All in the name of I'm DOING MY JOB~!
But what about doing your work, what's your purpose?
No human being is worthless
Think about this before you pull the trigger
And you call your sister a bitch and your brother a - WHOA

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
Knowledge Reigns Supreme again, ignorance is weakenin
Truth is what I'm speakin when I'm reachin and teachin my friends
Life is more than just cars and lust
Unity is a must, we need to build trust
Open up your mind to this, raisin up your consciousness
Whether you a pessimist, strategist or optimist
My synopsis is knowledge ain't where college is
Knowledge is for leaders and wisdom is for philosophers
Now I'm hearin London gettin violence like Brooklyn was
Brothers gettin shot just for lookin cuz?
I thought we deaded that, we need to be headed back
Yo France, you need to be coverin your brother's back
Bring the lovin back, cause the government don't love you
They into murder, money, and stayin above you
They want you all in prison
So before you kill your sister or brother stop and listen

[Hook]
{*scratched: "Whattya think makes up a K-R-S?"*}

[KRS-One]
Skinny cat, young cat, with a knapsack strapped to my back
1981 before the crack attack
I used to let the Olde English 800 suds bubble
In the last car of the Franklin Avenue shuttle
Brooklyn, no doubt, Wingate Park, no doubt
Prospect Park I'm all laid out
Homeless, my gear played out and I know this
But I'm an MC I stay focused
I took the shuttle to the D and wrote my rhymes in a hour
Took the D to the E, last stop the Twin Towers
Sittin in the belly of the beast
In the World Trade organization, bein harassed by the police
I wrote my rhymes right there on the spot
New York City, 1984 corruption was hot
Cats sellin uzis out the Jacob Javits Center for a high price
Let me tell you 'bout my life

[Hook]
{*scratched: "The type of shit a young black man
Gotta go through every day of his life"*}
{*scratched: "Hard times I've lived in
Wake up in the morning thank God"*}
{*scratched: "The type of shit a young black man
Gotta go through every day of his life"*}
{*scratched: "Hard times to live in
Wake up in the morning"*} ... {*"Now it's my turn"*}

[KRS-One]
Eighty-five comes in, eighty-six comes in
The marijuana with the cocaine mix comes in
High class hustlers, I'm takin flicks with them
My first songs Red Alert, he's mixin them
This a far cry from a kid sleepin on the bench
Now I'm V.I.P. in the club, this don't make sense
But it does, as I take daps and hugs
From cats that move drugs, they say "Kris rise above"
Everybody knew my style, Kris was no coward
I wanted to get in the game but my peeps wouldn't allow it
They'd say, "Read them books and write them hooks
Save our children, give 'em a whole new outlook"
So I did, I lived like any street kid
But I was handed 20 books, others were handed 20 year bids
Still they wouldn't sell to your mother or your wife
There was respect man~! Let me tell you 'bout my life

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
1987 my career blowin up now
Me and Scott LaRock took the year growin up now
Me I'm just a private cat, whatever you perceive as live
KRS is as live as that
We the livest act, in eighty-eight, eighty-nine, and ninety-now
But them years be far behind me now
In ninety-one, no one can find me now
I chose the underground to rhyme where it's grimy, WOW
Rewind me now, 13 albums for you to see
Or catch me speakin at them universities
My mind stays keen, I'm hardly ever seen
I do a lot of work, just not in the mainstream
{*scratched: "Know what you need to learn
Old school artists don't always burn"*}

{*scratched: "Know what you need to learn...
KRS-One... don't always burn"*}

"Welcome to hip-hop culture"
We stay hot like Tulsa
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, followed by a number ONE
These rappers they do-run-run
Lyrically they flashin two guns with new funds
But politically they do-run-run
When it's time to build, they chill, gettin nuttin done
But they mouth yes they do-run-run

[Hook: KRS singing]
I've, heard, just about all that I can hear
We talk, and talk, but this talkin is goin nowhere
I've, been, to the summits and conferences
And the people man, they'll tell you man
Hip-Hop is the way we live

[KRS-One]
If you're down for this nation, Hip-Hop the nation
Three generations, fourth in the waitin
Look at what we facin, mainstream penetration
Everyone's a biter now, no innovation
No syncopation, lost communication
Here's what we gotta do to fix the situation
First step - know what you creatin
Hip-Hop the culture, the consciousness, a new civilization

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
Everybody, c'mon unite now
Turn on the light now, stop all the fight now
Time to unite now, a new type of life now
No stress no strife, no gun no knife now
No board no pipe now, we seein the light now
Bein the light now, the future is right now
Hip-Hop is like WOW, ready to fight now
Sick of the hype now, just about right now

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
I, hear, uhh, hip-hop is callin me
The fact you must see sir, rap is not all of me
I use that to reach ya, rappers be borin me
Redo the industry with a two dollar royalty
What's the agenda, to hip-hop and politics
Don't you remember? The violence we stoppin this
Kris will defend the, hip-hop populist
The solution is simple, raise up yo' consciousness

[Hook] - sung without KRS

[KRS-One]
"Welcome to hip-hop culture"
We stay hot like Tulsa
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, followed by a number ONE
These rappers they do-run-run
Lyrically they flashin two guns with new funds
But politically they do-run-run
When it's time to build, they chill, gettin nuttin done
But they mouth yes they do-run-run

[Hook: KRS-One]
Get up! What we slowin down for?
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!
We got a whole nation to restore
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!
We gotta really love each other more
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!
When you see my CD in the store
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!

[KRS-One]
It's the teacher, class is open G
Let's get open on the concept of voting, we
Begin the discussion by viewing democracy
People power, a people ruled philosophy
Democracy is a system of government
Where the whole population is the sum of it
Where the goverment can't move without its people
Where, before the law, everybody's equal
But take a look at the police and how they treat you
Take a look at these corporations that cheat you
Democrats and Republicans are all see-through
Now we voting for the lesser of two evils
Man, don't let 'em deceive you
This is an autocracy, not a democracy
But to call this a democracy without mock interest
In the laws of society, that's called hypocrisy

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
Democracy only happened one time
In European history, now keep this in mind
It was practiced in Athens overseas
In 508 B.C. by Cleisthenes
Citizens would get together on a hillside
And decide how and if they was gonna ride
But in 322 B.C. here's what happened
Alexander of Macedon conquered Athens
And that was the end of democracy
Where the people had a say in their society
Today, we gotta get more knowledge
And learn about the function of the electorial college
It doesn't matter who you vote for today
The electorial college has the last say
But that's another day, here's what I came to say
Rise up

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
In corporate sponsored elections, who's winning?
This the wrong direction from the beginning
Every candidate got scandal, they all sinning
Tryin to convince you, tellin you what they've been in
But the real issues, they get avoided
While our children still gettin exploited
Heh, they call me Blastmaster Kris
Edutainment, that's what my tactic is!
Some criticize Kris, some laugh at Kris
But you can't say Kris is not an activist
Social justice, I got a passion for this
Cause equal rights we still asking for this?
So when I do my tours it's not just rappin for Kris
I'm givin you more than gun packing with this
I'm openin doors, you should be asking 'bout this
You listening to them whores and them capitalists
Their game is tight, got you trapped into this
It won't be long before the ring you like have to kiss
That's why I'm an activist
I help people not to get trapped in this
The temptation? You gettin wrapped in this
So get up, stop sitting like a pacifist
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up

[Intro]
And you say New York City!
Duane 'Darock', KRS

Jamaican Ave, Queens
KRS, let's go!

[KRS-One]
New, York, City, get it right, get it tight, get it hype
New York City's in the house tonight
All day, off and on, Broadway
The world's Big Apple is what they all say
Wait, way back in the day
Dudes from the South migrated this way North
Lookin for the higher pay of course
Led by the forces they became big bosses
Like Rick Ross is, the city that never sleeps
Yup, New York is
If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere
What's that?

[Hook]

[Over Hook]
Flatbush! Brooklyn (we live this)
BX Bronx, c'mon
Gun Hill Road, Grand Concourse

[KRS-One]
New, York, City, still part of my heart, still part of my start
As you can see it's still, part of my art
Still part of my lesson plan, listen man~!
N.Y., every year we fresh again
I be doin South Bronx everywhere I go
Everywhere I go, every nation know
I'm a New York dude that's not New York rude
All over the world I eat New York food
Ha, I'm at home anywhere, any place
Right now somebody from New York in this place
Yeah, no matter where I be
I'll always be N-Y-C

[Hook]

[Over Hook]
Coney Island! Brighton Beach
Wooo, Red Hook!
I see you Canal Street, Delancey Street
Hester Street, c'mon, New York let's go

[KRS-One]
New, York, City, metropolitan life, cosmopolitan life
It put the strength inside of my life
But New York City got its challenges also
Racism, sexism, crime, you all know!
Them guns that keep goin off bustin
And another one bites the dust when
Conflicts arise and dudes start bustin
And cussin, I gotta speak to this
New York is not unique in this
But if we keep sewing this we gonna keep reapin this
I'm teachin this, we gotta overcome our weaknesses
Remember man!

[Hook]

[Over Hook]
Big up to the firefighters, rest in peace

Woooooooooo!
Where my men at? Real dudes
Where you at? Look

[Hook: KRS-One]
Me is a mon, understand, not a passin trend
Me is a mon, understand, we provide and defend
Me a mon with a plan, my love it never ends
I'm callin - all my men, ALL MY MEN~!

[KRS-One]
All my men that be holdin down they house and they spouse
Men, y'all know what I'm talkin about
Real men, providin for the kids, no doubt
Holla out, 'gwan shout, you the man of the house
Men! In my opinion if we gonna start winnin
F'real, we gotta respect women
Every mister, hug your sister, it's the
Time to support your woman and not diss her
It's the, teacher, overstand
I'm like a preacher, reachin your upper man
Man, many don't understand
How important it is to have a plan

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[KRS-One]
All my men that be holdin they house down, true workin
All my men that be holdin they spouse down, for certain!
You spread love when you drivin around town, not jerkin
You a healer, you take away what's hurtin
Cause if a man can't do what a man plans to do, his purpose
Then a man makes plans with empty hands, he's worthless
He can't even understand the plan
What the second or the first is
Let me verse this or reverse this statistic
We gotta think futuristic
Strategic, logistical and even mystical
We need a new ritual
I'm tired of jumpin over buildings
And havin to stop to hold adult hands like children
C'mon, you can do it, c'mon
And when they get paid then they quickly run along
This ain't just another song
This is that fruit that reveals the right from the wrong
It won't be long here, before the storm's here
And real men are gonna have to be strong

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[KRS-One]
Be a MON, stand on principle
Just be a MON, let God live in you
Just be a MON, walk in the spiritual
Metaphysical, political, lyrical
Just be a MON! Understand you not a passing trend
And this is the end

[Busy Bee]
I told all y'all before
We comin back for more

[KRS-One]
We used to step inna de club with these murderers
Hustlers, thugs, pimps and burglars
You ain't gettin in the spot if they ain't heard of ya
And if you sneak in the spot they might murder ya
I used to be in them spots just servin the
Raw rhymes flows and yes earnin the
The respect from the streets in a circular
Over the years, an MC I turned into

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
Ladies and gentlemen, the most controversial
MC in hip-hop is about to raise your adrenaline
Settle in and grab a seat, they start meddlin I'mma grab the heat
I already grabbed the streets
KRS, you don't find me on your radio station
You find me chillin on them Indian reservations
I spit like cajun spice
You don't know KRS? Your momma must notta raised you right
Man I blazed your type, done raced your type
Man sit down~! You still on a training bike
I'm the crazy type, you the lazy type
Hey yo, look, I blaze these mics; cause

[Hook]

[Outro - ad libs from KRS and possibly the producer]

[Intro]
FRESH~! For 2008, you suckers
Yeah! James Desmond, yeah, ha ha ha ha
KRS, keep bringin that

[Hook: KRS-One]
Heat, the heat, the heat, the heat
The heat, the heat, the heeeeeat!!

[KRS-One]
I'm called when all falls and yes y'all stalls
And cornballs wanna get smoked like Pall Malls
I'm on all fours, all year on tours
Place your bets I'm takin all yours
All wars, topplin all scores
Teachin street laws, the teacher because I bring the

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
I'm called when no one is talkin
The truth about what's goin on and on and
When you wanna put that New York talk in
You cause the KRS-One to start barkin
Toward the mic, grab the mic, start barkin
Outside the club spot cars start parkin for the

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
Yeah, get it bumpin now, get it bumpin now
Turn up that da-dumb-dumb-dumb-BLAOW
I know you know how, we doin it right now
People in the club like WOW~! For that

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
OHH! It's gettin hot, don't stop
We just about to reach the top of hip-hop
That's why I'm called, with that yes yes y'all
At this very moment you feel no stress at all
No, I'm not testin y'all, this a real lyric
If you can hear it I'm blessin y'all, with the

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
So we can continue to go down the menu
I send you my poetry that critiques the evil that men do
You better attend to, the AC
When I MC I'm bringin heat lately, now fade me
No ifs ands buts or maybes
I'm not crazy, God made me speak with the

[Hook]

[Outro]
That's what I'm talkin about!

[KRS-One]
We need unity in the community
KRS, hip-hop is one
Conscious, gangsters, hustlers
Man

[Hook]
Hiiiip-Hop; I'm livin for that
Hiiiip-Hop; I'm livin for that
Hiiiip-Hop; I'm doin it for
Hiiiip-Hop

[KRS-One]
Yo - we went from nuttin to somethin, bein real and not frontin
No one was givin us nuttin so we resorted to gunnin
Growin up and we comin, up the ladder not bummin
Dodgin warrants and summons, from the cops we were runnin
Goin to school not for nuttin they teachin lies and assumptions
And they tell us keep comin, comin to school now for what? When
Comin back to a system that's whack and really not runnin
Oh I'm sorry it's runnin, it's not PROPERLY runnin
It's a conspiracy hear me man it's got to be somethin
I can get guns faster than I can get an english muffin
And the black church ain't sayin nuttin
We on our own cousin, I'm stickin to this

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
I'm livin for this hip-hop, I'm spittin for this hip-hop
I'm givin to this hip-hop, my life is hip-hop
Culture, and y'all know that
Hip-Hop in the media, y'all know it's whack
But just like them dopefiends who keep comin back
Like the mayor of D.C., buyin Joey's crack
No disrespect to either one of them but look at that
Study the metaphors in this rap
We bigger than crack, but we keep buyin it
We bigger than rap, but we keep denyin it
Justice, equality, keep cryin it
But the only way to get it is to start applyin it
Fat Joe that's my bro shows 'nuff respect
Talib, that's my bro, shows 'nuff respect
50 Cent that's my bro he shows 'nuff respect
Common! That's my bro he shows 'nuff respect
Snoop Dogg is my bro showed 'nuff respect
Dead Prez that's my peeps yo 'nuff respect
Cassidy's an MC who shows 'nuff respect
Hip-Hop is one, don't forget
I'm stickin with this

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
I'm livin for that hip-hop culture, shape it like a sculpture
Touch it why don'tcha, touch it why don'tcha
Hip-Hop is yours and mine and that's fine
But hip-hop's culture ain't about just crime
You caught up in the image and, don't know they rhymes
You caught up in they bodies and don't know they minds
So I'm, here to bring the truth in the place
Like don't think Common won't punch you in your face~!
And don't think Talib won't hold the heat
To stop the violence you gotta know your street
You gotta know who Tanga Reed is
Fat Joe's a leader, Busta Rhymes a preacher
KRS-One's a teacher
But through Cassidy my lessons are quicker to reach ya
We one community
I'm talkin about unity, in other words you and me
I'm with this

[Hook] - 2X
Word.. we stand out, word
We don't wanna sound like that bullshit

[KRS-One]
Let 'em all be aware, not at all will I care
You gotta know it's about the flow when you comin in here
Not how long is your hair, but how long were you here
How many dues you paid, crews you slayed, yeah
How many clubs you done rocked, f'real
You ever rocked outside with cats poppin they steel?
You fake like Ma-Ma-Ma-Max Headroom
You go from the bedroom to the studio back to the bedroom
We be on the front line, pavin the way
For you to do what you do, get what you get, say what you say
Flip what you flip, play what you play at the Grammy's
But you don't represent our family, you a thief!

[Hook: KRS-One]
All up and down the East coast
THINGS IS ABOUT TO CHANGE
All up and down the West coast, down in the South
THINGS IS ABOUT TO CHANGE
All up top and in North Canada, make some noise
THINGS IS ABOUT TO CHANGE
All my cats in London, Birmingham, Brixton, word!
THINGS IS ABOUT TO CHANGE

[KRS-One]
Join the campaign to rearrange the rap game
Don't look at me like I'm insane, the facts remain plain
You to blame, when you take it in vain
The gains and struggles and pains of those that already came
From the beginning we tried to attain, the money and fame
That's not new to the game, it's still the same
But what seems to change is the loyalty
Rappers degrade hip-hop for a royalty
It's all about me and my click and we ballin G
But we fallin, stallin our callin to be free
You can't see, they're gonna judge our poetry
In two-thousand and twenty-three, where will your money be?
Where will your Benz be?  Your friends be?
Your beginnin be?  Your end be?  Gently
You tell me to my face my style you envy
But behind my back you condemn me, you a thief!

[Hook: KRS-One]
All out in Germany, Africa
THINGS IS ABOUT TO CHANGE
Word up, hip-hop, join the nation, movin!
THINGS IS ABOUT TO CHANGE
Word up, all them fake-ass whack rappers, word up!
THINGS IS ABOUT TO CHANGE
Tell 'em, go to they shows and let 'em know it's like this
THINGS IS ABOUT TO CHANGE

[KRS-One]
For sure, it's the people that defend me
Yeah you on MTV, but did you know Ted Demme?
What about Fab 5 Freddy, Red Alert?
You not ready.. ready.. ready.. {*fades*}

{*ends with sound of glass shattering*}
You can't still worry about the charts position
It's the heart that you're missing
It's the art that you're missing

Just a little something to hold you over
The Kris'Style album on the way, Word Up!

When you're number one, everybody come
But when you drop to two, everybody still with you
But when you drop to three, everybody want to see
But when you drop to four, everybody still adore
But when you drop to five, people will help you to strive
But when you drop to six, you selling every mix
But when you drop to seven, people start guessing
But when you drop to eight, people hesitate
But when you drop to nine, it's when you start to find
That when you drop to ten, you start to lose your friends

When you drop to eleven, you record stops selling
When you drop to twelve, it's everyone for themselves
So when you drop to thirteen, you stop working
When you drop for fourteen, no more self esteem
You drop to fifteen, because you live then you seen
When you drop to sixteen, you're now out the scene
When you drop to seventeen, you see things you've never seen
That when you drop to eighteen, you know what it means
So you drop to nineteen, on then to twenty
At nineteen you lose your honey, at twenty your money to a Playboy Bunny
At twenty-one things ain't funny
At twenty-two, you don't know what to do
So you hit twenty-three, you look for security
So you drop to twenty-four, no more can you endure
When you drop to twenty-five, at the bottom you've arrive
When you drop to twenty-six, you're on old-school mix
When you drop to twenty-seven, they tell you to stop step in
When you drop to twenty-eight, you start to meditate
When you drop to twenty-nine, you expand your mind
When you drop to thirty, you see it was all dirty
When you drop to thirty-two, and it occurs to you
When you drop to thirty-three, now you can see
It's all about skill and the love for the art
Not who's above and who's bellow in the chart
You gotta look in the heart, it's there where you start
I and Hip-Hop are never ever apart, Word!

[KRS-One: speaking live]
First of all, I don't know WHO, y'all saw on this stage before me (aight)
I don't know WHO, y'all gonna see on this stage after me (true)
But THIS, is REAL.. HIP.. HOP!  Worrrrrd UP!
I'm gonna find out tonight, where the real hip-hop

[Intro] + (live response)
The real hip hop is (ova here!!!!)
The real hip hop is (ova here!!!!)
The real hip hop is (ova here!!!!)
Real hip hop is (ova here!!!!)

[Interlude]
Bla-blaow! Bla-blaow!
Clear 'em out, clear 'em out - word!
{*scratching: "Aww yeah!", "The real hip-hop, is ova here"*}
{*scratching: "KRS, come get up in they asses"*}

[Verse One]
You ain't Fo'Reel and you ain't Universal
Your whole style sounds like a infomercial
You ignoramus, I'm the baddest with the mic apparatus
Challengin the God of rap is madness, I'll snatch your status
With these elders lookin at Billboard you could stop them
But I got enough albums to make my OWN top ten!
You limited, like the spread of traffic
You bite my style off the radio
So when you speak in fact I hear the static
You better Chillout like Chuck, I kick like three Norrises
One of my sixteen bar rhymes is eight of your choruses
Of course it is, ridiculous
Watch out, I be in the club inconspicuous
Gotcha, on your, hands and knees
Ain't it about time for some real MC's?

[Hook] + (live response)
The real hip hop is (ova here!!!!)
The real hip hop is (ova here!!!!)
Real hip hop is (ova here!!!!)
Real hip hop is (ova here!!!!)

[KRS-One]
Yo yo, Beatminerz, turn up the track a little bit
Gonna do this right now

[Verse Two]
Remix it, don't re-fix it
First brigade, second brigade - all swords lifted
Formation, classified information
Code red rhyme style accurate articulation
Don't test my foreign relation
The cats in Brixton, Birmingham and London just waitin
Got my cats in France like ill
Even Africa's laughin at'cha right along with Brazil
The West Indies?  Jus' wan fi kill
Got Canada mad at'cha, Germany heard of me, they seen the skill
Hip-Hop is more than a thrill to us
A dollar bill to us, believe you will trust in that
Cause if you bust at me, on TV, CD
Internet trust that, I WILL BUST BACK
I turn down heat real quick, when I spit
You need the medicine what I speak is so sick
Then again these veteran be better than many men
Forever we hit 'em again better than ANY trend they could ever say
In any season, hot warm cold or freezin
When it comes to MCin, we believe in rhymin for a different reason
No frontin, my rhyme style tells you somethin
They rhyme style tells you who they freakin
But you was already told - what does it profit a man
To gain the whole world and lose his soul?

[KRS-One] + (voices)
There once was a dreamer named Peter (what else happened?)
Peter was also known as Skeeter (what else happened?)
Peter had sex with Anita (what else happened?)
Anita got pregnant from Peter (what else happened?)
Peter wasn't just with Anita (what else happened?)
Peter knew this girl named Rita (what else happened?)
Peter had sex with Rita (what else happened?)
Rita got pregnant from Peter (what else happened?)
Now TWO girls are pregnant by Peter (what else happened?)
But Rita doesn't know of Anita (what else happened?)
And Anita, doesn't know Rita (what else happened?)
The two of them, only know Peter (what else happened?)
Now Peter's at the mall with Anita (what else happened?)
You know, he runs into Rita (what else happened?)
Well Rita takes a look at Anita (what else happened?)
And Anita takes a good look at Rita (what else happened?)
Well Rita starts to pull out the heater (what else happened?)
The heater now is pointed at Peter (what else happened?)
Anita jumps right on Rita (what else happened?)
Rita busts shots at Anita (what else happened?)
Rita missed Anita by meters (what else happened?)
But Rita's bustin shots at Peter! (What else happened?)
Just then somebody shook Peter (what else happened?)
Yo how many spoons of the dairy creamer? (What else happened?)
It's Keisha sayin WAKE UP PETER (what else happened?)
That's why they call you the dreamer (Now that's happenin!)

[Intro]
First of all
I don't know who y'all saw on this stage before me (Alright)
I don't know who y'all are gonna see on this stage after me (True)
But this is real hip-hop
Word up
I'm gonna find out tonight where the real hip-hop

[Chorus]
The real hip hop is over here
The real hip hop is over here
The real hip hop is over here
The real hip hop is over here

[Interlude]
Blaow-blaow, blaow-blaow
Clear 'em out, clear 'em out
Word
Yo, Nelly

[Verse 1]
You ain't for real and you ain't universal
Your whole style sounds like an N'Sync commercial
Ignoramus, I'm the baddest with the mic apparatus
Challenging the God of rap is madness, I'll snatch your status
With this ugly look in the Billboard, you could stop them
But I got enough albums to make my own top ten
You limited, like the speed of traffic
You bite my style off the radio, so when you speak it back, I hear the static
You better Chillout like Chuck, I kick like three Norrises
One of my sixteen-bar rhymes is eight of your choruses
Of course it is ridiculous
Watch out, I be in the club inconspicuous
Got ya on your hands and knees
Ain't it about time for some real emcees?

[Chorus]
The real hip hop is over here
The real hip hop is over here
The real hip hop is over here
The real hip hop is over here

[Verse 2]
We on the hunt tonight
When you see me coming, I don't front, I fight
People say I'm contradictory
'Cause I'm all about peace, to say the least, with a violent history
It ain't no mystery, these rappers wanna get with me
My people don't see that all they hear is "Stop hittin' me!
Stop beatin' me, Kris!"
You want to help my career, Nelly? Well, you can help if you don't exist
I think it's 'bout time we stop these pop rappers
Fuck these pop rappers, hip-hop does matter to me
Does it matter to you, my crew?
If it does, you know what the hell to do
Throw your guns in the air, pump it like "Yeah"
Let these bitch-ass rappers know we in here
Go to the shows, huh, boo 'em off stage
Tell 'em KRS told you they're at the end of they days
Let me tell you, let's give hip-hop a lift
And don't buy Nelly's album on June 25th
That'll send a message back to all them sellouts
House nigga rapper, your bottom done fell out
You don't even know how
I told you I wasn't talking about you then, but I'm talking about you now
Blaow, one to the knees, blaow
One goes right through
Even St. Louis don't like you
{*audience clapping, beat starts*}
We've been having these gatherings for over 12 years
Uhh, my first one, was ah at Latin Quarters in 1987
With Afrika Bambaataa - he threw the first one, that I attended
We kept the tradition going through the Stop the Violence Movement
Through Human Education Against Lies, Rhythm Cultural Institute
And now the Temple of Hip-Hop
This is Hip-Hop's spiritual base
And as a spiritual base, we look to guide the youth in that discipline
Uhh, no culture is a culture, unless it has principles
Unless it has morals, unless - we are unified
In some sort of principle, something we are not going to step beyond
Something that defines us
What I'd like to do, is just for a moment as we.. deal with this
Think about your role in Hip-Hop
Think about what you do everyday in Hip-Hop
This is not about right now
It's about twenty years from now
It's about ten years from now
The tapes are rolling, the notes are being taken
This is the type of thinking we have to get into
If this is going to survive and last
So again, Hip-Hop Appreciation Week, is a time of self-reflection
A time for Hip-Hoppers to ask
"What am I doing, to preserve the culture?" {*echoes*}
Word up!  It's just a little somethin to tide you over, word up
The "KRStyle" album comin soon, KRS-One all in the room
We gonna bounce these cats this year, word up
Why they do this?  Ha - yo, yo

[KRS-One]
I climb up the back of rappers
Reach over they head, and rap backwards at 'em
Excuse me madam, I used to throw these uzis at 'em
But I'm a teacher, skills I truly have 'em
These clubs I duly pack 'em
Potential lawyers engineers and doctors, I do attract 'em
Go to your professors and ask 'em
If the songs of the "Edutainment" in college they didn't blast 'em
Yes - I'm that ancient one
I set the framework for today's rappers to make they funds
But no you don't know me son
My facial features matches the Sphinx with it's nose redone
You know how many clubs we done rocked?
You know how many guns we done popped?
You know how many funds we done dropped?
You know how many ones we done got?
We been gettin live since the days of Chubb Rock
We know how to survive; these other cats
Be in at nine o'clock then be out at five, uhh
We doin the overtime, on stage I over-rhyme
Makin these whack rappers tow the line
Steppin to me, I know you blind; cause your whole flow
Your show, your style, you know it's all mine!
The first time you learned to spit
It was either me, Kane, Rakim or Slick Rick!
{*water splashes*}
Welcome to the "KRStyle"
This year I had to switch styles and bust off two miss-iles
And that's not all, rappers have the gall
To pray and pray for my downfall - but still in all
I have X amount of lyrics to get 'em all
Live at the club I spit 'em all
Rappers backstage lookin sad and piti-fal
Cause they know I'm the pinna-cle and they mini-mal
I spit the metaphysical, the spiritual
The oracle, the lyrical, the oratorical
Rookie!  I'll mop the floor witcho'
I'm the lyrical foundation to all your flows
All your clothes, all your shows and I'm not alone
You wouldn't even know how to hold the mic or the phone
You couldn't even bite on the bone
While we was rockin mics out in Rome
Now you hyped cause you grown?
You know we internationally known, the people love it
But what they learnin bout is on the whole, look above it
But let us get back to what we call hip-hop
Before you whack rappers went pop
{*water splashes*}

[Intro - sped up vocal sample]
Tonight's a special night
So remember with pride, these 20 happy years

[KRS-One]
I can't leave my b-boys alone
I can't leave my b-girls alone
Let's turn this house right into a home
C'mon y'all let's get into the zone
Vibrate or mute or cellular phone
In here they might already be on roam
Minds are blown, I'm showin
You ain't gotta go major you can do it alone
As I look back on all the years, all the tears
All my peers, in fear
I hear, insecurity, the need for clout
Low self-esteem and self doubt
KRS lays out a whole different route
And shows you what hip-hop is really all about
Then we on the route, release self doubt
And sing with the feds when the fear is out now
Clear 'em out now, from the bottom to the tip-top
Take the vow, I am hip-hop
And recreate yourself, love don't hate yourself
Do not deny or lie or fake yourself
You can make yourself, reawake yourself
You can mold remodel and reshape yourself
You gotta take yourself more seriously
Create yourself to what you really can be~!
Yo the villain is free, look at me, I do what I do
I am hip-hop and so are you
Yo we almost through, but before we go
I wanna invite y'all all, to every show
Where the b-boys and girls are kept on their toes
Like the Rocksteady Crew tribute with Fat Joe
So now you know, if you got what it takes
No doubt, show 'em what you really all about!

[KRS-One]
Yo, now that that is out of the way
Let me continue what I came to say
Breakers, writers, emcees and DJ's
Beatboxers too we've come a long way
Come to the Temple of Hip-Hop today
Our hip-hop week is every third week of May
Hip-Hop appreciation we remember
Hip-Hop history, that's in November
Peace, love, unity, that's the agenda
When I'm on the mic that's just what I send ya
We at the end sir, so what's the answer
Hip-Hop can be more than MC's and dancers
It's time to expand your
Awareness, consciousness, enhance your
Living, tell me, what are you playing for
What are you staying for, what are you giving?
I will demand your respect, with two MC's
Two b-boys, two DJ's on set
Two hour shows you bet!
We get authentically hip-hop as hip-hop can get
Independent, free from debt
2005 you ain't seen nuttin yet
Some like it dry, some like it wet
Some like to give, some like to get
Some like a good soundset
You a b-boy and you ain't been out to the Bronx yet?
No, yes, maybe, someday
Whatever, we bring it to you Sunday to Sunday
Workin for peace love unity and fun day
Just a little somethin to balance off gunplay
So now for the break if you got what it takes
No doubt, show 'em what you all about!

[KRS-One]
Who was the first to flash the heat on the cover?
Who was the first crew to go against another?
Who was the first to go acapella on a video replay?
Who was the first to lose a DJ?
Who was the first to teach at Yale?
Who was the first to hit that hip-hop reggae, on the nail?
Who was the first to say Stop the Violence
And teach that real bad boys move in silence?
You're soon to see the mindbendin rhyme weapon
Get more busy than two-two-three-double-nine-seven
All these rappers, swear they the best
I know whatchu thinkin about, "Where's KRS?"
Eighty percent of these rappers fake they {shit}
The other twenty percent they goin upstate and {shit}
There's no way out except knowledge and wisdom
I got it so I spit 'em you ain't got it you gotta get 'em
Who was the first to produce mix and write
At the same time up in the club rockin the mic?
Who was the first to have a DJ and a side man?
The first to say what is hip-hop? "I AM!"
Who was the first to produce gangster {shit}?
Put out, gangster hits with a gangster click?
Not no prankster {shit}, Steady B, Mad Lion
Just-Ice, Shabba Ranks and {shit}
My Channel is Live, my only battle is Jive
MC to MC, you won't survive
You'll be censored cause my Crew is 2 Live
I ascend like Christ and watch you die

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Breakers (HERE!) MC's (HERE!)
Writers (HERE!) Beat-boxers (HERE!)
DJ's (HERE!) Hip-Hop (HERE!)
Hip-Hop (RIGHT HERE!) Hip-Hop (RIGHT HERE!)

[KRS-One]
I'm like Noah, I'm takin 'em, two by two
I took, them and them and I'll take, you and you
I took, them and them and I'll take, you and you
Be I'm right or be I'm wrong
You'll see I'm tight with this mic, you should be like, "B I'm gone"
But you still in my face Neo, I'm not your girl
All that ice and thug life, that's not my world
I'm the teacher, but you still can't see
Cause while you respect 2Pac, 2Pac respected me
Another thing; don't ever show me another ring
Remember you Rudy Ray Moore, I'm Martin Luther King
Everything you bring sounds horrendous
You need repentance, 'fore I take attendance

[Hook]

{*KRS-One hums a melody for a bit*}

[Hook]
Yeah man, yo Marla what's up
Yeah, Inebriated Beats, big up Boston, the whole Boston
Edo.G what's up man?  I got you
We gon' bounce this now, can I start?  Can I start?
Here we go

[KRS-One]
I'm the newest and the truest MC on the mic
I wrote over 500 songs, pick what you like
It ain't easy bein me, by day or night
But it's easy bein free to recite what you like
Hip-Hop is my inalienable right
When it comes to emceein KRS is a whole different type
Now go get it right, did I flow spit it tight
In a fight I was the type to go get a pipe
BINK! BINK! BINK! BINK!  Movin 'em back
BINK! That's the sound of an aluminum bat
But it seems they new to these facts
Which means they new to the tracks
Which means they do hold us back
Too new to know all that but still runnin they trap
Do the math, radio gets a 20 record a week stream
But only three are ever seen
What happens to the other 17?
It's a PROBLEM.. PROBLEM..
PROBLEM IN HIP-HOP TODAY!
We gotta solve it
Too many players and not enough crime
When they finally wake up they woulda ran out of time
They can't see today how they effect tomorrow
Too afraid to follow, cause they trust is hollow
Because according to the laws they'll harp some sorrow
Yo, "Victory Over the Streets" - that's our motto
But if people ain't got no vision, that's a PROBLEM..
PROBLEM IN HIP-HOP TODAY!
We gotta solve it

People say, "Kris - why you teach so much?
Why you preach so much?  Why you speak and such?
Why you so bent on reachin each of us?"
I reply - because you eatin with us
In the future our children will be meetin with us
Have a seat then with us and start speakin with us
They'll be critiquin us to be sure they believe in us
We don't need a PROBLEM..
PROBLEM IN HIP-HOP TODAY!
We gotta fix it

We live non-toxic, we teach that hip-hop is
The transformation of all subjects and objects
Retrain your optics, to reinterpret the topics
We gotta stop treatin hip-hop like a product
And more of a strategy; I got graphs, charts
Sacred textbooks, these cats can't battle me
But they try, and why?  Cause that's a PROBLEM..
PROBLEM IN HIP-HOP TODAY!
We gotta fix that
These cats need history to get with me
But hip-hop's history's a mystery
So how they gonna find out, trial and error
We can make one the example for all to get better
Inform, KRS is not the norm
I go from hot to warm to cold to hot
But hip-hop's history many forgot
And that's a PROBLEM..
PROBLEM IN HIP-HOP TODAY!
We gotta solve that

[interlude beat]

PROBLEM.. PROBLEM IN HIP-HOP TODAY!
We gotta fix that
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Word
All my people in Boston make some noise
Whew! Inebriated Beats. You got to Believe

[ Hook: repeat 6x ]

Believe it

[ Krs-One ]

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Look, Look
All my rap is street related
How can you spit and not have it hit the pavement?
These beats we created be inebriated
Meaning intoxicating, believe we made it
Now we can see they faded
Them hoes done went from me so horny to me so hated
From Hip Hop, we never deviated
Come to the Temple, hear the flow and you can see me state it
That Knowledge Reign Supreme
I be on the same streets, with them same hustlers and fiends
But Hip Hop, do you know what it means?
It means victory over the streets, check the last Beat Street scene
I leak knowledge, inner-standing, wisdom
KRS the type that get you outta the prison
Elite knowledge, inner-standing, wisdom
KRS the type that get you outta the prison, Believe

[ Hook ]

[ Krs-One ]

Yo, Yo, Believe it
I only come to help you achieve it
You could believe what you want, you can take it or leave it
Slow it up or speed it, but never mind if you dont need it
But I still gotta teach it, I still gotta speak it
There's more to the streets than guns and stuff
To all my fathers, you know one sons enough
But if you have two or three
You know they get -gasm what they see on the t.v
You gotta believe me
We gotta rise up
All my daughters I beg, close your legs and kind of like open your minds up
Before your times up, and you find what?
You was just another stepping stone for him to climb up
I'm what? A player? No
A ho? No. An average rhyme-sayer? No
A neighbor? Yes. A friend of the Savior? Yes
I can honestly say I'm blessed

[ Hook ]

[ Krs-One ]
Yo, its a Hip Hop intellectual heavyweight
That leaves 'em in a truly inebriated state
If you thinking about leaving, you better wait
We only talking about freedom and showing love instead of hate
But no, you dont think it's real
Until you're shackled 'round your wrists and your ankles and your heels
You could brag if you feel
But don't forget to mention the twenty to life is part of the deal
When the DEA flash that shield
The bigger they are as stars
Huh... the harder they squeal
And usually your name comes out
Leading to that knock on the door, and you being led out
That's when my lyrics matter
All them guns and bitches and hoes, you don't wanna hear them rappers
That's when you wanna hear pastors
But if you listen now, you can like avoid them disasters
Turn your life over to God today
Not a little bit, Yo, go all the way
I said, turn your life over to God today
Not a little bit, Yo, go all the way Yo

[ Hook ]

[ Krs-One talking through Hook ]
It's live like that ya'll
It's live just like that
Big up! Terry Andrell
Word up! D.J. Tine E. Tim
Whew! G. Simone, you know you're not alone
G. Simone, uh, uh
Mickey Mic, Yo what up Mickey?
Uh, Yo, Yeah

[Hook: repeat 2X]
If you want a woman to treat you right

[KRS talking through Hook]
That's right, that's right
I think y'all need to listen to this, stop what'cha doin

[Verse One]
Women will treat you right
But you can't be one of them lookin to freak lookin to beat you type
You gotta seek the light in the dark
I used to free this mic in the park
Now I speak direct to your heart
Women want men to show respect for they art
Women don't be checkin for the chart
They go straight to sister to sister and pick it apart
Begin with the heart, our sisters is a living art
Always givin, always deliverin, always making something bigger from just a little part
Big up to the sisters that start up businesses
With nothing but muffins, still liftin kids
Strong women ,work long women
Not them dump-ass dizzy stupid thong women
King-Kong women, bring it all women, independent women with thoughts & opinions
Women like G.Simone, See, I maybe the Pharaoh
But believe she is the crown Let me leave it alone
Cause a lot of ya still wanna rome, they got houses but still want home
Sittin on chrome but forever alone
Cause intelligent courageous women they were never shown
They say they don't love them hoes
But Jesus allowed hoes to wash in all his toes
I don't mean to impose, but if you want a woman to treat you right
I don't think you need to start with the clothes
I think you need to start with what she knows

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
That's what you got to know from the start
Whats in the heart & the mind
Without that you startin out blind
You're going into a direction of what a trap ???? behind
Its like you sittin in a cell with the doors opened
And you decide to sit and do the time
Free your mind, don't pattern your life after some freestyle rhyme
See me, I'm...
Word!!! *echoes*

Uhhh!  Uhh, uhh!  Unh!  (Awww yeah!)
Uhh, unh, uhh!  Unh, uh, uhh, uh, uhh, uhh
(Yeah bring somethin in a little like that yo!)

Break the Chain, Break the Chain! *clink*
(repeat 4X)

Yo, get with your culture it'll catapult ya
Ignorance is like a vulture and it will insult ya
My name is Krash, Joe Krash, Big Joe Krash
Built to last, education for mass
Never take a dive yo, strive for the livin
Today is a beginning, for you to start winning
You cannot walk around town like you a idiot
Livin it with some Boyz N Tha Hood is your affiliate
That's simply ignorant, really that's the enemy
Train your brain to attain your identity
Self construction not Self Destruction
If you're tryin to be a gangster, you're buggin
If you're not movin ahead yo, you're buggin
You gotta look at yourself, and try to change somethin, huh
So check the animation for the nation of the -- money
My name is Krash, I'm way liver than Bugs Bunny
This is the underground way to put knowledge in your brain
But first we gotta break the chain, c'mon
Break the Chain, Break the Chain! *clink*
(repeat 2X)
Word! *echoes*
Break the Chain, Break the Chain! *clink*
(repeat 2X)

Yo, I don't wanna be a dummy walkin round smellin funny
Lookin bummy or crummy with no money (Go!!!)
But when I go to school the teacher ain't teachin
And when I go to church the preacher ain't preachin
Who they think they reachin, the old style is dead
Instead wake up the knowledge in your own head
With new ideas you got fewer fears
And with fewer fears, you can get paid in it for years
Yo, take a look around where you at
If you think it's wack, educate yourself and change that (wack!)
I'm fallin down and I can't get up I ain't buyin it
Change the way you think, you'll change your environment
We weren't always slaves or livin in caves
This is what we learned, so this is how we now behave
You can get new ideas by lookin ALL around
Read lessons, ask questions on what is goin down (yeah)
Break the chain that used to be on your foot
Now it's on your mind, behind your eyes
You can't vote, you can't see it, you can't believe it
I'm breakin the chain of ignorance, anything you can achieve it (yeah)
Open your eyes, realize I'm bein God
Enough of the lies, let's rise and
Break the Chain, Break the Chain! *clink*
(repeat 2X)
Word!! *echoes*
Break the Chain, Break the Chain! *clink*
(repeat 2X)
You know.. life is funny..
If you don't repeat the actions of your own success
You won't be successful
You gotta know your own formula, your own ingredients
What made you, YOU..

1987 I was at the Latin Quarters
Listenin to Afrika Bambaata give the order
The call of the order was to avoid the slaughterA
He said, "Record companies ain't got nuttin for ya!"
Without a lawyer, he taught The Infinity Lessons
In how hip-hop could be a, many a blessing
And that was great, so in 1988
There was no debate, we had to end the hate
The name of the game was "Stop the Violence"
And unity, knowledge, and self-reliance
We - started talkin bout Martin and Malcolm
Had these ghetto kids goin, "Huh, what about him?"
1989, Professor Griff speaks his mind
But his freedom of speech is declined
1990 came with the West coast
East coast, West coast, who is the best coast?
Lookin back now, of COURSE it was bogus
The whole argument was where we lost focus
We got hopeless; not with the lyrics and music
But with hip-hop, and how we used it
Or abused it, you know how the crew get
"You like it cause you choose it"
1991, we opened our eyes
With Human Education Against Lies, we tried
To talk about the state of humanity
But all these others rappers got mad at me
They called me "Captain Human", another message was sent
"Self Destruction don't pay the {fuckin} rent"
Remember that? Nobody wanted conscious rap
It was like - where these ballers at?
Where can they call us at? All was wack
Hip-Hop culture was fallin flat and that was that
So in 1992, I found my crew
They said, "Yo Kris, what you wanna do?"
I said, "Damn - why they wanna get with me?
If I bust they {shit} I'm contradictory
If I play the bitch role, they take my shoe
Tell me what the {fuck} am I supposed to do?"
So I did it, don't stop get it get it get it
All of a sudden these critics they wanna spit it
"Kay Are Ess One is con-tra-dic-to-ry"
Just cause I wouldn't let these rappers get with me
{Fuck} that, {fuck} you and {fuck} your pen
If a rapper wanna diss, yo I'd do it again
But I'm makin these ends, and I got my friends
And I really don't wanna have to sit in the pen
So I go back to the philosopher
1993 hip-hop is uhh.. wack
Go back, check the facts
1994, "Return of the Boom Bap"
It wasn't all about the loot
It was all about Harry Allen Rhythm Cultural Institute
Blowin up, 1995
Conscious rap is still alive
But nobody wanna play it, nobody wanna say it
Nobody okayed it, they'd all rather hate it
1996 it really don't stop
We put together somethin called the Temple of Hip-Hop
Not just DJin, breakin, graf and lyrics
But how hip-hop affects the spirit
"Step Into a World," that's what I did
'97 I was raisin my kid
Or kids, but I, had to go
Cause New York DJ's changed the flows
To clothes and hoes, but that wasn't me
I'll be damned if I dance for the MTV
So in 1998 I began to debate
Should I go now, or should I really wait?
'99, I moved to L.A. you see
And took a gig with the WB
Started studyin philosophy full-time
To have a full heart, full body, full mind
But you know what the problem is or was?
DJ's don't raise our kids, cuz
They so caught up in the cash and jewels
How they gonna really see a hip-hop school?
How they gonna really see a hip-hop temple?
They don't even wanna play my instrumentals, but
Big up Dr. Dre, Snoop, Xzibit
Especially Xzibit, he was there in a minute
Mic Conception, all of them, said
"Yo you need help? I should call them"
When I was in L.A., I held the crown
Bloods, Crips, they held me down
I could never forget Mad Lion, killer pride
With the gat in the lap in the low-ride
Oh I can't forget, Icy Ice, Lucky Lou
Julio G, that was the crew
Davey D, Ingrid, David Connor
The list goes on and on, let me tell ya
FredWreck, and my man Protest
Much respect, no less
To my spiritual and mental defenders
Big up to L.A., temple members
But in 2000, I seen how I wanted to live
I wasn't no executive
So I picked up the mic and I quit my job
Said to Simone I gotta get with God
She said, "Don't worry bout these dollars and quarters
Record companies ain't got nuttin for ya."
Damn, she took me back to Bam!
Took me back to who I am!
Brought me back to the New York land!
Now I overstand!..
{interviewer}
Now KRS-One, now you've been quoted as saying that
Rap is something we do, hip-hop is something you live
{KRS} Yes!
{interviewer}
Explain that to us please
{KRS-One}
Well, well, today hip-hop, we are advocating that hip-hop is not
Just a music, it is an attitude, it is an awareness, it is a way
To view the world. So rap music, is something we do, but HIP-HOP
Is something we live. And we look at hip-hop, in its 9 elements;
Which is breaking, emceeing, graffiti art, deejaying, beatboxing
Street fashion, street language, street knowledge, and street
Entrepenurialism - trade and business. And uhh, that's where y'know
That's the hip-hop that that that we're about. We come from the uhh
The root of, of Kool DJ Herc, who originated hip-hop in the early 70's
And then Afrika Bambaata and Zulu Nation (mmhmm)
Who instigated something called The Infinity Lessons
And added conciousness to hip-hop, and then Grandmaster Flash
With the invention of the mixer, on to Run-D.M.C. and then myself
And uhh, we created the "Stop the Violence" movement, you may recall
A song, "Self Destruction" and and and so on. All of this, goes to
Uhh uhh, the idea of LIVING this culture out and taking responsibility
For how it looks and and acts in society
Yeah.. uh-huh.. underground, never stop y'all
Underground, K.P. y'all c'mon!

[Hook: April S. Williams]
Ain't no stoppin what we done
Don't give up this fight is won
There's no way they can hold us down
Cause with power and strength we gonna take it now
Take that stand realize the truth
Knowledge intellect bringin minds anew
There's no way they can hold us down
Cause with power and strength we gonna save you now

[KRS-One over Hook]
Uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh-huh
Tell them again, tell them again!

[KRS-One]

See these cars, see these checks, intellect
See these thugs, ain't no sweat, intellect
A thousand miles, how do you do it? One step
Now check out this flow, they wanna be down, but they cain't
Original +Criminal Minded+ flow, they just ain't
Ready for the real, ready to peel off the paint
Your style is fake, the teacher returns to debate
You the best? That's bull, you questionable
Highly flexible, wasn't you sexual?
Now you hardcore? You need to see God more
I sit on the faculty; you, you sophomore

[Hook]

[KRS-One over Hook]
Uhh, get 'em up

Yeah, that's right, uh-huh

Another Kenny Parker exclusive!

[KRS-One]
Time to get it, now you did it, tryin to spit it
You don't fit it, ask the critics, already did it, skipped the gimmicks
I don't mimic, metaphysics, you'll admit it, better to live it
Better to give it, so I spit it every minute so you get it
My lyric is wicked an' full of culture y'all
Huh? Battle, nah - get back in your car
Either you never heard of me or you really wanna get with me
But as your teacher let me test you for a learning disability
You feeling me? Cause you can't, get it through your head
This is, sui-CIDE!! You're better off dead
Let me not amp you up, cause this style you can't do what
My stomach can take it and your stomach it'll cramp you up
This is, breath control, breath control stylee
I get up all in that ass that (?) heinie
Try me, back in the days you woulda had sorrow
Try the teacher today, and you won't see tomorrow cause

[Hook]

[KRS-One over Hook]
Uhh, we get 'em up
Uhh, that's right, get 'em up
Yeah, uh-huh, get 'em up
Yeah, ONE MORE TIME NOW!
Uhh, that's right, get 'em up
Uh-huh, uh-huh, get 'em up I HEAR YOU
Uh-huh, I HEAR YOU, WORD UP!
LOOK AT THIS!

[KRS-One]
Like a piss on the streets I exist
Not the meat but the fish
Complete the feat when I'm speakin the heat into this
Witness Kris rippin this
Don't trip on this, skip ahead if you're ready
My show medley is deadly
I'm about a hundred million mic years away
These players I don't hate, but I'm not here to play
I hit it all day, all night, all afternoon
Rock all mics from the days of sassoon
Where the hell was you? On the corner with rats
When we was at the LQ, lockin it down and that was that
Divine speaker, mind keeper, time teacher, time leader
I'll be sittin in the club by the speaker
Waitin for you rappers to choke up then I eat ya
Like some prehistoric winged creature, AHHH!
On your neck, like the American eagle facin East and West
I be the best, Blastmaster KRS cause

[Hook]

[KRS-One over Hook]
We get 'em up
Uhh, yo, we get 'em up
Like, YEAH, I SEE IT OVER THERE
I SEE IT OVER THERE, IT'S.. YEAH IT'S OVER HERE!

Big up, to the Zulu Nation, PEACE!

[KRS-One]
We crush, them, and they click
Let me tell you right now what you supposed to get
You supposed to get free and intelligent
Not a platinum plaque, that's irrelevant
We CRUSH, THEM, and they crew
Let me tell you right now what you supposed to do
While they floss with the chi-ching and all the rings
You stay focused, keep doin your thing
You cannot get the diamond ring, if you can't really sing
Or if you haven't got a skill, that you ready to fling
What you bringin to the table if you not really able
Tryin to get to the top, like the Tower of Babel
Back in the days, remember all the old gold cables
Where they at now?  Sold, when they dropped from the label
All the money they gave you made you very unstable
They really enslaved but you wasn't able with the coke in your nasal
To see, you up in the crib but they rockin your cradle
You a joke and you fatal, they made you an M.C
Meaning: Most Confused
Not E-M-C-E-E, that's what I use
Many people really wanna know from me
When I'mma drop and they can go cop, the next LP
Or CD, or T-A-P-E you see
It's about word of mouth, for me
We crush, them, and they click
Let me tell you right now what you supposed to get
You supposed to get free and intelligent
Not a platinum plaque, that's irrelevant
We CRUSH, THEM, and they rap
Yo, they don't really know where the money is at
And what's funny is that, is if you'd just stay focused
They'd be the one to be the brokest!
I'm from the inner city, that's right
Flashy asses and titties that's right
No pity mad graffiti that's right
Broken gang treaties, that's real
I speak complete broken slang freely at will
I spit what I'm about to spit, get what I'm about to get
Never no counterfeit, movin about a bit
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, only a few like the sound of it
Others can't get down with it (ONE.. TWO.. THREE.. BREAK!)
So why did I have to come off my sabbatical?
Battle you?  My metachromatical will splatter you
I got another track to do, I can't mack witchu
Your rhymes are fictional, mine are factual
I'll embarass you, I'm glad to do
I'm the teacher but in the streets it can be bad for you
I feel sad for you, cause you frontin like you gettin ahead
But you really on E instead
I've come to show these people you're not my equal
All you want is the cash and a ho in a see-through
Yeah; KRS-One comin through with the breeze team
You know how we do
We crush, them, and they click
Let me tell you right now what you supposed to get
You supposed to get free and intelligent
Not a platinum plaque, that's irrelevant
Yo we crush them, and they squad
Let me tell you right now that it's all about God
You can walk around the streets like you livin it hard
But a real teacher know when you scarred
I refuse to be bought, I refuse to snooze
I refuse to come up short, I refuse to lose
I refuse to be caught in the court
I refuse to refuse bein taught, I refuse evil thoughts
Cause they whole {shit's} wack, trap's wack
You're wack, you're pack's wack, in fact I jab-slap that
Cap at that, now, retract that crap, wherever I'm in or at
You better go back and sip that crap
Bring your gat, I'm lovin that
Like football, you'll be, runnin-back
Blazin 'em, merely dazin 'em, barely playin 'em out
These are God's lyrics, I'm just sayin 'em out

We crush, them, and they click
Let me tell you right now what you supposed to get
You supposed to get free and intelligent
Not a platinum plaque, that's irrelevant
We CRUSH, THEM, and they crew
Let me tell you right now what you supposed to do
You supposed to be buttoned up right to your neck
If you a woman, you'll get respect
Let me tell you we crush the, and they crew
Let me tell you right now what you supposed to be
You supposed to be a man of integrity
Above the law, you effect destiny
We CRUSH, THEM, and they lies
This is concious rap, we not hypnotized
Anywhere the action's at, we rappin at
Takin it home and unpackin that-that-that

[Intro]
Uh-huh, whatchu thought? Uh-huh, we was done?
Uh-huh, whatchu thought?! Yeah, yeah
Yeah, whatchu thought? Uhh, uhh, uhh
Yo, yo, back again! What's that? Back again!
What's that? Word! C'mon

[Hook 2X: Nyce]
A North Face and skully hat don't make you a thug
A army suit, a pair of Timbs don't make you a thug
An ill mug and a gat don't make you a thug
A real thug is a thug that's Hush!
(Yo, yo, yo, check it, check it)

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
Let us begin, KRS, winnin again, KRS-One did it again
KRS bigger than them, look at them they bit it again
I think my gun just gonna start clickin again
Click-clack, I always spit back
Anybody call my name I go get that
In fact we draggin 'em out, to a deserted route
The teacher returns, you must learn, the word is out
No doubt highly respected, Front Page Records
Off the hook, yet still connected
Are you teachin yourself, teachin yourself?
I'm like history repeatin itself
"Criminal Minded", you've been blinded again
Lookin for my style you can't find it again
You can find these others that may sound like Kris
But when it comes to the hands they don't get down like Kris!
They never ran up in the clubs with a hundred thugs
Never had the respect of Crips and Bloods
Never knew B.O., they never knew Big Pun
They never battled MC's, they never bust they gun
They don't know that, all they know is that show DAT
That's Digital Audio Tape if you don't know that
Now go back and get my name correct
'fore I snatch that platinum from 'round your neck

[Hook 2X: Nyce]
A doo rag a platinum chain don't make you a thug
A fat ride with chrome don't make you a thug
That tough guy talk don't make you a thug
A real thug is a thug that's Hush!
(Word, yeah yeah, uh-huh, yo Yo, yo, yo hit 'em Kris!)

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
What mean the world to me? H-I-P, H-O-P
And S-I-M, O-N-E, and G-O-D, I stay low key
I go down to hell, and slap up Satan
Then return to heaven, where Scott LaRock is waitin
Resurrection, just like my brown complexion
When I speak, I don't need protection from the heat
I walk these streets and I'm quick to hit first
Throw on any beat I'll be quick to spit first
And rip town, I take one look around
And all you hear is, "Get down, get down, get down!"
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, I stay on blast
That's why these rappers want me to go on last
That's the truth, that's the fact, that's the deal
Forget sex appeal, my tech is real
And my rep is real, K-R-S
Woo-woop-woop! That's the sound of E-M-S
The rag on your head, it best stay white
Cause I can turn that red in a mintue a-ight?
Now go back and get my name correct
'fore I snatch them diamonds from 'round your neck
Once again, get my name correct
'fore I snatch that platinum from 'round your neck

[Hook: Nyce]
A North Face and skully hat don't make you a thug
A army suit, a pair of Timbs don't make you a thug
An ill mug and a gat don't make you a thug
A real thug is a thug that's Hush!
A doo rag a platinum chain don't make you a thug
A fat ride with chrome don't make you a thug
That tough guy talk don't make you a thug
A real thug is a thug that's Hush!
(Yeah.. yeah.. yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 3: KRS-One]
To all my heads who wanna see an improvement
In hip-hop culture, join this movement
We need more Glocks than my man Freddie Foxxx
The knowledge I spit to the click it don't stop
That hardcore God-core, ready to start war
Rock more shock more top your pop tour
I'm sure I'll drop the grade to zero
When the teacher return, I don't chase DeNiro
Like where yo? Where yo? They livin' in fear yo
It's a jungle sometime, but I got my spear yo
The album's called "Sneak Attack", that's what it is
KRS-One spittin' facts to kids

[Hook: Nyce]

[Hook]
My rhymes still be ill
You don't really want it
I suggest you chill
You don't really want it
#1 I'm still
You don't really want it
The prophecy is fulfilled
You don't really want it
KRS in the streets
You don't really want it
I drop the rawest beats
You don't really want it
No ice just heat
You don't really want it
Playa face defeat

[Verse 1]
That was a nice try Nelly, I don't mean to be bold
But put that "Hot in herre" bullshit on hold
And let's get down to the facts of the matter
In the dictionary, under whack rap: you the rapper
It's simply cuz you're lacking the spectacular vernacular
And hip hop's character seems to be in back of ya
Either that or you're truly amateur, I'm asking ya:
How does it feel to have the whole world laughin at ya?
You just too stupid to see
I was made on the streets, you was made on MTV
How you gonna talk about my nose to attack me?
When you steady guzzling them pills for your acne?
My nose comes from a line of kings
Your acne comes from you eatin the wrong things
Your words don't make me hurt, they make you work
You'll hurt when you find it's you getting jerked
I tell ya, it don't take me to say
Don't buy your album, street cats ain't buying it anyway
You telling me make up my mind
Yet on your album, you don't know if you wanna sing, or rhyme

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You trying to diss me? How?
If it wasn't for the true-school your bitch-ass wouldn't be here now
Blau blau, show me respect from the gate
Or I'mma have to drown you kids like Andrea Yates
You can't handle the break, I'm a flamethrower, you a bic lighter
You think I'm cocky cuz you a dick rider
I spit tighter, I'm not like all the rest
I'm not a playa, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express
So nevertheless I'mma teach ya, teach ya
But when them slugs hit you, you'll be screaming, "Momma, EI! EI!"
You never seen me sing? You don't know what I bring?
You'll be singing the blues like B.B. King
I'm all about the unity of Miss and Mistas
You all about grabbing money and dissing our sistas
Take your ass back to TV land
And let this be a lesson, you can't see me, man!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Just when I thought I could do my gospel
And become an apostle I got a whole to get hostile
I don't mean to knock ya Nelly
But ain't you that MTV house nigga with a spine like jelly?
I'mma do this by the book, for the art
I heard what you said on BET's 106 and Park
But what you don't know, is right around the corner on 3rd
I hold a Desert Eagle, and no, it's not a bird
You sound absurd, you're gonna bring me back?
I taught all year round the spot ??? had
You copycat, with sloppy raps
You chill with N'Sync, I chill where hip-hop be at

[Hook]
Ha, hahaha!
("Bring it back, that old New York rap
Bring it bring it back, that old New York rap") -- repeats in background
The only reality
Is now...
Yo!

Verse One:

I rock slow and easy like soul
The New York flow, is strictly for the pro
Hip-hop! Ladies and gents
So you can know, every word yo, of the sentence
Hey la, like De La, I got Common Sense
Save the compliments for after I commence
To evidence of MC's, rockin under false pretense
Yes they get burned like incense
Myrrh and frankencense, you know the consequence
When you rock with KRS and don't make sense
Kris represents all MC's, that rock with ease
I'm not conceited, I got confidence in my abilities
Agility's my credibility
Oratorical artillery in all facilities
It Takes a Village like Hillary
When killin me, KRS has wide range capabilities
On the microphone, in the combat zone
MC's get eaten like the ozone layer
Hey ya, I'm not a playa I'm a teacher
But if I wanted your girl
You'd be Living Single like Latifah
Action Uptown like Monifah
I hit like a beeper, and hot like the bunny on Easter
Lyrically let me freak ya
With moves like Scoob and Scrap
Rock Stready, Stretch, Al and Kiko
I warm up any room like a heater
Bringin a New Balance to the speaker like a sneaker
Still a teacher, prove it, like Madison Square
This Garden of Eden, keeps the party movin
("Bring it back, that old New York rap
Bring it bring it back, that old New York rap") - repeat 2X

Verse Two:

I'm interested in skill and how we build as a culture
I don't eat off old material like a vulture
Repeatin myself for wealth is bad for my health
Everyday I express myself with a dope lyric
From my inner spirit, then I share it with others
As they hear me, enhancin
East and West, overseas, brothers and sisters
Sons and daughters transcended all borders
I deal with mind expansion
Anytime you aimlessly dancin, and romancin
It's your life that you be chancin
Not that I wanna sound gloomy
But I don't rhyme about Judy Judy, cutie and shake your booty
When you gonna grow up and be GOD?
Instead of making a rap a full time job
Yeah, it's a job and not an art
They only rhyme to get money;
Cause true self-expression takes heart, and guts
Rhymes, and cuts
Tight minds and not tight butts
Reach your goal, like a puck
I wish you good skill and not good luck
Cause only skills put you up out the gutter so I utter
("Bring it back, that old New York rap
Bring it bring it back, that old New York rap") - repeat 2X

Verse Three:

That old New York flow means wrote for fun
And if the money come, THEN THE MONEY COME
But today and everyday, KRS speaks the truth
We dealing with unemployment in the city black youth
Usin rap, to put clothes on they back
No culture, or disciplined, way to act
But soon yo, we'll take care of alla that
We're huntin fi de power help supress people tracks
That keep the culture intact, and soon you will see
In the black community, black unity
Not black nudity, after black puberty
For every crew to see, to breakin down the black community
The only one to blame is you and me
For not takin responsiblity for our artillery
Verbally, you heard of me, Knowledge Reigns Supreme
Over Nubians Everywhere, I kick it cause I care
The end isn't near, it's way over there
BLAOW! The only reality is now
But when I say bring back the old flava
That means bring back the ORIGINAL MC behavior
("Bring it back, that old New York rap
Bring it bring back, that old New York rap") - repeat 2X

Verse Four:

Now I got to show you how the BX rocks
MC's, are jumpin out shoes and socks
Body body rock body body rock
I'm the king of rock'n'roll, ahh yeah
Throw your guns in the air! Glocks down
Who the hell is this, pagin me at 5 o'clock in the mornin
Where you gonna be, because...
Fresh is the word, many money missin many
Jenifa, oh Jenny
We make up all these rhymes inside our head!
Yo, let's connect politic ditto
Uh-ha! Uh-ha!
Another Inebriated beat
You know what time it is, straight for the street
KRS-One, hold tight! Look, look

[Hook One: KRS-One]
Crack - don't mess with that
Speed - don't mess with that
It's whack - don't mess with that
Greed - don't mess with that

Look look; dealing - don't mess with that
Crying - don't mess with that
Stealing - don't mess with that
Lying - don't mess with that
Meditation - mess with that
Forgiveness - mess with that
Education - mess with that
Hip-Hop - we lovin that

[Verse One: KRS-One]
I rhyme for respect y'all, intellect y'all
Not sex y'all, move that neck y'all, correct y'all
Checks y'all, cash y'all, don't last y'all
With cops y'all to blast y'all, harass y'all
Flash y'all as they pass y'all, through the glass y'all
These videos gas y'all cause they trash y'all
I ask y'all this fact y'all
Unaired y'all, these cops y'all they scared y'all
They fear y'all they hear y'all they hate y'all
Less than 40,000 a week, they make y'all
Cops y'all with black feet, livin from week to week
Walk crooked beats in the streets y'all
They greet y'all with the heat y'all, to defeat y'all
It's deep y'all, hear what I teach y'all, and speak y'all

[Hook Two: KRS-One]
Hate - don't mess with that
Trends - don't mess with that
? - don't mess with that
Revenge - don't mess with that
Truth - yeah, mess with that
Skills - yeah, mess with that
Proof - yeah, mess with that
Build - yeah, mess with that
Wars - don't mess with that
Freaking - don't mess with that
Whores - don't mess with that
Cheating - don't mess with that
G.E.D. - mess with that
Science of mind - mess with that
Family - mess with that
Hip-Hop - we lovin that

[Verse Two: Shuman]
Yeah, yo.. aiyyo, yo
Who seein us, with an overdose level of free in us
They bring the heat to us
They don't really want the beat in us
Take heed to us
While they plottin and schemin to be deletin us
Best believe in us, they not defeatin us
Them Glocks wanna bust
With twenty-one shots to put the leak in us
So they can bloody the street with us
What does it mean to us
You know what they need from us
Give cream to us, hide the lies and deceit from us
That doesn't equal us
Who's ready to get in the Jeep with us
Form a fleet with us and take back the street with us
Meet with us, drop bombs in the street with us
Never saw it comin, attack on the sneak with us
Thus, they can't compete with us
We flow through your veins like DJ's
When they cut, you'll be bleedin us
I came with Kris to heat it up
Showin my body's the temple, hip-hop is the lock
Now put the key in us

[Hook One]

[Verse Three: KRS-One]
Truth y'all, facts y'all, proof y'all, black y'all
Time to check this map y'all, are we goin back y'all?
Let's make a pact y'all, come together watch your back y'all
Stay in tact y'all, never whack - gimme dap y'all
Comin at y'all, headcrack y'all with the facts y'all
Police y'all, on the attack y'all if ya black y'all
So if this is fact y'all, when we rap y'all
Over the track y'all, why we rap about crack y'all?
That's whack y'all, we trapped y'all
Holdin the gat y'all just to kill another black y'all
Clak clak clak y'all, it's like that y'all
KRS-One yo, let's take it back y'all, listen!

[Hook Two]
Yo yo brand new KRS y'all, Maximum Strength
	5 Boroughs of death we rep to death
	Yo Kris, set it for The Bronx..

[KRS-One]
We hit em and get em, we stick em and jig em
We pick em and kick em
Flippin them whip and I'm wing-clippin them lip
Cause I'm cold sick of them
Much quicker than them lyrically trickin and my Tribe
Be on a Quest like Tip and them
On every avenue puttin the full clip in em
Splittin and strippin em down while spittin a round
Into them soundclash see winnin them, just begginin them
Get rid of ev-ery bit of them with them negative idioms
I don't even consider them
In the new millenium we killin them
Breeze Deep, Kenny and Will and them, KRS-One we thrillin em
Many battles we been in them now we rebuildin them
We blaze, fulfillin them, Keith ?, Jesse, Jamil and them
We originate styles, other be stealin them

[Vigilante]
You got a good rise in your rolodex, who flow is next?
Comin out to {fuck} with the best, put it in your chest
Inhale it and hold that, blow it out when I say let go; let's see
If you can hold your breath, by the time I flip to the next flow
This sho' is real, this is the deal, guns I'm runnin
Gotta make it out of town to flip my {shit} and keep it comin
Then bring it back, with another stack, of raps to blow your back out
How many of y'all wanna go for yours I keep my dogs in the crackhouse

[Buckshot]
Let's take a walk through Crown Heights
Steppin through the city at night, with the ? and two mic
Form a little lynch mob, and stomp through the five boroughs
Head back to Brooklyn in the Expo
Back on the block, I see the cops everybody clockin
Buckshot, when you see the rocks, me I got you shocked
Why not?  You see the recipe
Buckshot, I represent Brooklyn and my {nigga} Biggie

[Keith Murray]
I'm from C-I, L-I, F-L-Y
Where the {niggas} and the {bitches} stay paid fly and high
Where a slut'll get mad if you call her a {bitch}
And a rat'll get mad if you call her a snitch
Where the rich emerge, with the {niggas} from the ditch
And it's a myth, they get {niggas} from the suburbs, that's herbs
Yo this is for my {niggas} on the block all day
Who don't give a {fuck} waitin for crime to pay
Put your money on it, yo we never fronted
Long Island got some of the best {niggas} that ever done it
From Riverhead to C.I. to Brentwood to Wyndanch
{Niggas} comin through will not stand a chance
From Roosevelt to Freeport to Hempstead to Uniondale
Comin deep from the depths of hell
I'm dead serious, even though you see me smilin
Rough enough to break New York from Long Island

[Cam'Ron]
We destroy {niggas}, need advice, cause I heard em sayin Jesus Christ
You should see the sight, cookin ox-tail, peas and rice
Makin about a G a night, they can't read or write
But I got every creed and type, you need a dyke, babygirl I see the light
But sometime y'all get crimey crimey, grimy grimy
But those with a tiny hiney they get whiny whiny
So guard your girl, Harlem World, cock the gun, pop it son
Fila fam, illa players, Killa Cam is still the man

	

[Bounty Killer]
	Uptown massive, Uptown the borough
	Uptown let the ? kali, no sorrow
	Uptown trestle, Uptown of course
	I grab you ? they got me turn up to North
	And if dem turn up North ? hurt no tell de boss
	And if dem tell me off dey are a bunch of ghosts
	And if dem gal are up, well den dem know da gal are boss
	De rap dancehall try on de Mossinos
	And if dem tie me off, dem can call me Cedro
	I put a rap to singalong in all de ? crew
	And if da gal a bitch ? ? the rainbow
	? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

[Killah Priest]
Yo, hit you with the force of an iron horse
Tear your face off the planet, leavin one-third damaged
Witcha back cracked the earth canvas, leavin mountains slanted
Rock the earth of the axle, crabs who
Polar bears beneath the sea gravel
Thoughts be runnin wild like the Lil' Rascals
Puttin dinosaurs inside of figure fours, rip you with nine inch claws
Chasin {motherfuckers} through malls, and clash in halls
Beatin {motherfuckers} through walls, stompin through floors
And jumpin down elevator shafts
Searchin for they {ass}, stayin low in the grass
Wearin a gas mask, wrappin their hands up in plastic bags
On stage like a savage goin mad
WHAT?  Yeah yeah, sooooooooooooo!

[Prodigy]
Yeah, by all means you know you gotta put Queens on it
Put cream on it, Q.B. we rep often
Take over your party, slamdance witcha hood
Took your ladies back to the projects with us
Then sent her {ass} back on the Q-train home
Satisfied, she learned the words to my thug song
See we one big borough of Dons with firearms
And we never use those, til the man act
Other than he's 'sposed to, {nigga} what I'm 'sposed to do?
Shots whistle, damn near missed dat
Shoes get pissed at

[Redman]
From the, tip of my Timbs, to my eyebrows
The hostile, english, Olde E widemouth
Get PCP fiends, jumpin off cliffs
And if you had the balls, you'd be walkin off stiff
My paragraph alone is worth five mics (uh-huh)
A twelve song LP, that's thirty-six mics (uh-huh)
And while you win Un Hype (uh-huh) I spit on your snipe
And tell you {fuck you} and that {bitch} on your bike
Brick City!!

[Reverand Run]
Aiyyo.. now bust it
Never try me crimey I'm grimy so don't deny me
I be Little like your Rascals and stymie to fly that hiney
Buy me keys, to my Benz and my Coupe
Like Jay and Run and D.M.C.'s, that's the name of my group
(now speed it up)
Beat to the rhythm of the rhyme
I'm givin up a dime, there go another line you figured
Never drivin by nine, never givin up a dime if you was
Never been that {nigga}
If you really wanna test me, brother don't stress me
Or you just be bowlin
It's Reverand like a Jesse, brother that's just me
And that's just my colon

	The five boroughs of death, we rep to death
	Step aside little {niggas}, show time yep
	It's goin down the moment we inside the spot
	Let's rock'n'roll, you know the M.O., it gets real
	when the five boroughs of death, we rep to death
	Step aside little {niggas}, show time yep
	It's goin down the moment we inside the spot
	Let's rock'n'roll, you know the M.O., it gets hot

[DJ Premier]
Dedicated to the great Scott La Rock
R.I.P., this one for you, my G
Let's get it

[Intro: KRS-One]
Boogie Down Productions, with Premier, we gettin paid
Y'all write the wackest songs, our shit be better
Remember, you act up, you will not win
Cause then I'll begin to smash you
With rhymin', rhymin', rhymin'

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
Criminal minded, this the jumpoff
My first one blast like you poppin that pumpoff
Yo Premier, why these rappers so soft?
They corny ass raps be makin me doze off
You know I get the whole house open
Got the whole East, West, North, South open
I ain't jokin', you know how many times
I spit rhymes and left rappers wit they mouth open?
Y'all need to fall back
The hip-hop you got in you now, I installed that
I spit a raw rap, peace and war rap
Ten more raps, where the tours at?
Cause the world is so hood, you must always be ready
...TO LET IT BLOOOOOOOW!!! (BUCK! BUCK! BUCK! BUCK! BUCK!)
I'd rather talk about peeeeeeeace, but these rappers won't let me
SO HERE WE GOOOOOOOO!!!
I'd rather mind my business, but these rappers think
They Superbad, that's when they get smothered, chocked, and gagged
I just bought another Jag
Cause when I spit lyrics, I step-father like your other dad
("One-two, one-two") I stay true
I'm a Gang Starr and I'm Guru
Hah! I train like CHOO-CHOO!
Y'all rappers rap crap, BULLSHIT DOO-DOO!!
Who knew?! I don't compare to you
Look at my nose, I even take in more air than you
I'm more aware than you and I spit it
I built this hip-hop matrix then programmed you IN IT!
I would tell you what's gon' happen this summer
But I'mma general, I don't talk to runners
Y'all just rappin and rappin shitty
So when you talk about battle, I get giddy

[Scratches by DJ Premier]
"Wh-wh-wh-when I'm on a mic"
"KRS writes poetry"
"Cause I'm KRS and I'm on the mic
And Premier is on the breaks"
"Boogie Down Productions" (That's right, Primo!)
"UH!!!" (Let 'em know)
(KRS, Criminal Minded)
(Yea) "So here we goooooo..."

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
Criminal minded, you been blinded
By the ice and the way rappers shinin
K-R-S, that's how I sign it
God knows I try to live non-violent!
But rappers be too defiant, no doubt
They make me wanna try this new Magnum out
They be draggin 'em out
Cause of death: Magnum goin off in the mouth
What y'all talkin 'bout?! You better +Walk it Out+
Y'all start mumblin when that Hawk is out
New York ain't out! WHAT CHA'LL TALKIN 'BOUT?!
Y'all POP like when the cork is out!
Stoppin the violence is what I'm all about
STOPPIN THE VIOLENCE IS WHAT I'm ALL ABOUT!
But you raise ya fist to Kris, Ill maim ya wrist
And blow you out like a birthday wish!
I'm much sharper
Including New York State, the whole East Coast is Kris Parker's
But real talk, Digny
The true kings of New York left when it change hands to Disney
I got no time for the kid rap
The gun talk, drug talk, we already did that
These days I'm tryin to give back
Knowledge, wisdom, overstanding - now spit that!
{scratches by DJ Premier}
"Wh-wh-wh-when I'm on a mic"
"KRS writes poetry"
"Cause I'm KRS and I'm on the mic"
"I, I-I-I'll see you folks around the way"
"Wh-wh-wh-when I'm on a mic"
"K-K-KR-S writes poetry"
"Criminal minded"
"So here we goooooo..."

If I, ever make a record

Away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now, but look at me now

[Intro: KRS-One]
Here we go, yo, yea, KRS in the building
Marley Marl, whuttup, Marley Marl, yea, look up

[Verse One: KRS-One]
Yo Nas, this KRS shouting you out
B.R.O.N.X. I couldn't make it to the jam
To be live on your set
But take these sixteen as a sign of my respect
You're Illmatic and you still got it
The crown of Hip-Hop, there's still time you could still grab it
Don't be distracted by them faggots
You still fly, they remain maggots
Nas, you will not lose
Your contribution to Hip-Hop makes you the top two
And with KRS, we're the
Top two
These mothafuckas find themselves laid out on FOX news
Yo Nas, Hip-Hop can't be dead, you brought it back
With the words you said, you are Hip-Hop fo'real
And that shit between you and Jada, y'all gots to chill

[Hook: Nas Sample] X2

[Interlude: KRS-One]
We're all brothers, we're all brothers, rise up, Hip-Hop
Nas you're the man, word up, Hip-Hop, One Nation
Big up, from the Bronx, to Queensbridge, Marley Marl in the house
Come together, rock on, Bronx, Queensbridge come together

[Verse Two: KRS-One]
Uh, you brought Queensbridge back
And like my man Fat Joe, you made the Bronx lean back
Nastradamus I seen that
You was ahead of your time then man, a Prophet, I mean that
People ask where's Dr. King's dream at?
I think it's Hip-Hop, we already seen that
Yo Marley, I know you're in the building
Yo Kelis, I know you're there chilling
Shout-out to the Queen on the scene
Hip Hop is Dead I know what you mean
I seen Hip-Hop die about five times already
But yet, we still rock steady
Stay ready, we're about to resurrect career, the real, fo'real
They gon' feel the steel
K.R.S. - N.A.S., North, South, East, West

[Hook: Nas Sample] X3

[Outro: KRS-One]
Congratulations, you gon' do it this year

Rock on, Marley Marl, another house for hits production

[Outro - Nas Sample]
I'm the N the A to the S I R
I'm the N the A to the S I R
I'm the N the A to the S I R
I'm the N the A to the S I R

Fresh for 2007, you suckers..
I, brrrrrrrrrrrrrring!
Philosophy when I s-rrrrrrrrrrrrrrr-ing!
I step like wildabeasts, killll-llll-lllling!
MC's harming me I sling-lllll-ling!
Rhymes don't copy me you gots to be crazzzyaaayyyyy
Yet you believe that you can slay me play me maybe
Flip the style I be killll-illl-ing, the track
Obey me, easssssse back, you're silly wack and idle
Give me back the title my arrival questions the survival
Of any rival rapper you're simply a promotional data
Me, Kris the Master, beat, this the Master
Seek, Kris the Master, eat, with the Master
Treat, this the Master, but don't compete with the Master
Or you'll seek disaster
Faster than the BlastMaster's folk can say "Oh!"
That means YOU yo, you wrestlin with the style in your mind
But I'm like sumo, doin judo, you know
I go then you go, lyrics we run through run through
You think you got the 4-1-1
But I got the 5-5-5-1-2-1-2
You're done through rhyme sessions with the teacher
You know you shouldn'ta come to
"Once again back is the incredible, rhyme animal" --] Chuck D
	KRS, K-K-KRS (or variations)
(repeat 4X)

Canibus/Can-I-bust, like weed?
And give you what you need
There's the kickoff and KRS-One has the lead!
Indeed I'm all around your neck like beads, raw hell
I knock like doorbells, I'm hot while you chili/chilly like Hormel
I'ma sure sell, no doubt
How you think you gonna battle and take me out
With my phrases in your mouth?
Stop I rock your socks your blocks and set fire
To your Reeboks, can't you see dat de God of rap I be dat
From the highest tree top you'll hang
I ride the fly cars like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
You can't hang, with my mic con-cep-tion
Cause we're not in the same gang, my juice is instant like Tang
You rhyme beginner, wack rap sinner
You attack next snap back CRACK and I'm the winner
But that's simple for me to do as I'm speakin defeatin you
Fairly beatin not cheatin you, heat-seekin and leakin through
All styles be creepin through, in amazement they keepin you
You be thinking, "What were you doin?  The teacher competes with you?"
You can run like the people do or you stay and you see it through
I be lyrically eatin you anywhere I be seein you
On the hip like I'm beepin you in your mental you're peek-a-boo
No limit what we can do metaphorically teachin you
Tell me what can you show me, simply you do not know me
No I am not your homie, yo my lyrics are Epic
But I'm not down with Sony, in the middle like Monie
Scarfacin like Tony, your whole style is baloney
You think you off the hook... but you're simply a pho-ney

[KRS-One]
Word..
Sonja.. you know you saw her in the movie
And my man Saul, he's like THIS!

[Saul Williams] * singing *
There is no ocean like the one, within
Look to the moon rise with the tides, and swim
(repeat 4X)

[KRS-One] * speaking while Saul sings *
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah
KRS-One, coming through.. like this
Uh-huh, do it, do it like that, like that
Uh, uh-huh

[Saul Williams] * sings first two lines *
Saul the road to Damascus, come follow me
The serpent swallow the moon, but it won't, swallow me
(Yeah, speak the word!)
Intellect is like a major city
Laden with concrete, metal
Advanced modes of transportation
Shining buildings, and fenced in parks
Spirit is the mountain's forest wilderness
And vast countryside that surrounds it
Too many people live in the city
Struggling day to day for mere existance
Most have forgotten how to live off the land
They only experience nature on class trips
And short-term vacations
For those that live in the country
Cities are like amusement parks with high prices
And temporal satisfaction
At the end of the day, they are tired
And ready to go home, and relieve their ringing ears

[Saul Williams] * singing *
There is no ocean like the one, within
Look to the moon rise with the tides, and swim
(repeat 2X)

[KRS-One]
Uh-huh, speak the word
Hyper-accelerated meditations talk
The reversal of this word dispersal is thought
There is no difference between thought and talk
Like the blackboard chalk and homicide chalk
They both give outlines
One is designed to outline the mind
The other outlines the body after a crime
Could it be that these two chalks are connected;
Meaning the body gets outlined when the mind is neglected --
-- or poorly directed
Like the teacher with the chalk
Or is the teacher the beginning of the homicide we talk?
Be selective in your speech
Cause the chalk of the two technical teaching has taught each
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone
Nearly every daughter, nearly every son
Ignorance reigns supreme for some
They chase the sum, inviting the I-R-S to come
Make the connection, choose your direction
Use your protection when sexin AND hexin
Things come back cause they really never left
If the secret to meditation is found in the breath
Then speech is another form of meditativeness
Whattya say to this latest rhyme or poem?
Some have been known to quite the mind through
OHHHHHHHHHHHMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
Everything over?
Sounds can't be the end yet
Nah nah nah we can't go that route
Uh-ahh
That's what I'm sayin though!
*applause*
Yeah, everyone gather round, gather round
Now I'm gon' start it off first (why don't you start it off first)
And you gonna follow me, it goes like this

I'm lookin at this girl who's been livin a lie
But I don't know why she's livin a lie
(Perhaps she'll die)
I'm lookin at this girl tryin to be fly
But behind the scenes she breaks down and cries
See she breaks down and cries caise she's livin a lie
But I don't know why she's livin a lie
(Perhaps she'll die)
I'm lookin at this girl she's always high
Cause she likes to get by by stayin high
She's always high cause she always cry
Cause she's livin a lie...
And I don't know why she's livin a lie
(Perhaps she'll die)
Yeah, yeah you got it, here we go (check it out)

I'm lookin at this girl wit her bloodshot eyes
You could really tell now by the size of her eyes
She got bloodshot eyes, cause she's always high
Cause she always cry, cause she's livin a lie
But I don't really know why she's livin this lie (here we go, one more time)
(Perhaps she'll die)

(Yeah, yeah) Last time, last time

I'm lookin at this girl tryin to hide her face
Cause she thinks she looks bad and her life is a waste
See her face she hides cause of her bloodshot eyes
Cause she always high cause she always crys
Cause she's livin a lie...
And I don't know why she's livin a lie
(Perhaps she'll die) Rrrrrrrahhh!

You don't really need-a, lyrical teacha
When I reach you through the particles and ways of the speaker
What I got to say is positive and negative
You draw whatever energy you need to live, give and take
Build and destroy, life and death
Inhale, exhale, of breath
The point is yes, everything in life is a choice
East and West, wack rapeprs or DJ KRS-One
Dunn I come like the ancients with a drum
Come along you can hum along or run along
Sing a song if you wanna sing a song
This meta-lyrical poet will surely put it on
I don't wear or count of frauds
But I can prophesize by lookin in your eyes
If you're right or wrong, it could be all
It's always the little things that control the big things
Undirected mind waves will bring a string
Of unexpected anything until you cipher
Whether niggative or negative you don't need either
You need to direct your thinkin through your speakin
Prevent the negative from leakin out into the atmosphere
Do I make myself clear? Achieve a major goal this year
But don't ever step here
*DJing of 'Spark Mad Izm' by Channel Live and KRS-One*
Expertism, is lyr, lyr, lyr, lyricism
My flow, my flow, my flow'll take you over
My ex, my ex, my expertism
Is lyr, is lyr, is lyr, lyr-i-cism
My flow, my flow, my flow'll take you over
My, my flow'll take you over
My, my flow'll take you over, like
My, my flow'll take you over, like...
You better check this

*sung part*
Plan up your family, ha-high, me say
Plan up your family, ha-high

*sung part again*

Yeahhh...
This one's dedicated to the girl you see
And all bwoy big D, livin in the ci-ty, I sing

*sung part*

Uhhhhh...
Sex is part one but every story has a sequel (try)
Not to live with your parents now people
Let part two be planned by you, not fake (why?)
Cause your baby you'll start to hate (cry)
Like if you can't afford a sausage
You on edge, baby cries, you throw him in the garbage
You know the stories that you hear in the news
Babies being killed, infants being abused (right)
Do people life they live like a movie
Yellin, "Do me!  Do me!"  Too much loose booty
They wanna be Blowfish like Hootie (chill)
Premature pregnancy is ill
You never hear the other side of the story (like)
Like what happens after you hit the shorty
Right (right), you check it before you get butt naked
Heed the science in the record
*sung part* 2X

Yeah...
This one dedicated to the girl, you see
And all bwoy big D, livin in the city, I say

*sung part*

Yeah, yeah...
You know the time y'all, you know the time y'all
Hear the rhyme y'all, time to free your mind y'all
School's open here's the message comin next
Some dumb-ass kid feels proud he had sex
("I knocked it out! Yeah I'm the mack and I'm all that!")
Nine months later, you can't afford Similak (why?)
You look back on your life, you say it can't be
I never asked or planned to have a family
Thinkin back in bed you was a happy camper
And uhh, now your partner can't find the Pampers
Every day more sex you pursuin (sex is good)
But think about what you doin
Everybody yellin revolution
But still on the ave cruisin, not seeing we losin
Control your life and choose your direction
With sex and foreplay use protection
Control your life and choose your direction
With sex and foreplay use protection
*sung part* 2X

Yeah this one's dedicated to the girl you see
And all bwoy big D, livin in the city, I say

*sung part*

You know
I got to add this last piece to the song
So no one gets me wrong, and we can live long
Havin a child is good for your health
But how you gonna have a kid yo, when you a kid yourself?
It's your life, not hers, or his (true)
Now you want someone to come and watch your kids? (ooh)
You try to give em to your moms, she ain't with it
And with no sisters, a job you can't seem to get it
Now you applyin for welfare, medicare for health care
Now your whole life is goin nowhere
I'm gonna say it, you might not respect it
But most pretty little girls wind up pregnant
You wanna wear tight clothes and act loose
But now someone gave you the truth!  Yo

*sung part* 2X

(KRS-One)
Wake up your mind black people, it's ill
Superior people use superior skill
We can defeat any congressional bill at will
The hip-hop nation will fulfill all prophecy in society with inner city philosophy
The hip-hop in me must come out or die to lock in me, no doubt
Executed properly
I begin to shout out, splat out approximately
Three single syllable words per second
Like I am God, you are God, we are God, forget it
Time to sell it in a lyrical battle, I'll never jet it
Like a shot to ya head I'm embedded in your mind
With constant conscience lyrical rhyme
At the end of time, I'll be in my prime
Re-designin', rhymin'
Like an oratorical Shaman
I look still but I'm climbin
Newsflash here's the latest findin
Ya whole environment created in ya mind and in ya heart
Hip-hop displays art
The highest level of mental expression, play your part
Hook:

I'm the intelligent wise on the mic (x3)
Everybody knows

(KRS-One)
All these motherfuckers tryin to be large
With their two car garage dressing like El DeBarge
It's played out, fadin out, over
Talk to ya broker, time to give back that Range Rover, soldier!
I told ya woe onto the hip-hop perpetrator
Posin' like a neighbour stealin all ya flavor
Danger danger ya better rearrange ya thinkin
Check what you eatin and drinkin, ya breath is stinkin
With the stench of a snitch with information, leakin
Linkin up with the enemies of Kris speakin
But I'm already in 1999
Feelin fine while most MCs will be out of sight and outta mind
Rewind cos I got a little bit of time
Negativity will be wiped out by paint after turpentine
I find my rhymes combines mobility, creativity
Positivity, productivity, sensibility
To a wide vicinity, engulfin your facility
Oh silly me, you killin me I begin to see your stupidity
I rock way hard you can't get wit me
Or go wit me or flow wit me
Frankly, this is grown people poetry
Forget your little off-the-head rhyme
It's way past your bedtime, for the tenth time
Forget tryin to get mine
I went from the park with my arc in the dark
A simple spark, the little Park sparked now I'm in ya heart
Everytime you think I'm comin one way, I come another way
If you ain't got no fly rhymes, say today
Run away, run away, run away....little boy
Like the TAT crew I terrorize all toys
Noise is what I hear
When you shout your rhyme into the atmosphere
The blast master's here!
Hook (x2)

(KRS-One)
Now which motherfucker wants their title tooken, defended
I see my schedule it's open-ended
I can move somethin around like ya booty ass sound, beginner
What happened? You couldn't be an Apollo Amateur Night winner?
Now the teacher you reach for
Don't you know I am that lyrical gate keeper
You'll get ran like sneaker
No peep tha, no peep mine, no peep this hard style
That keeps the party floatin like a fetus, meanwhile
You hold your head, you can't belive this godchild
Presented recommend ya and because you're not fertile
Or fertile {pronounced "fertil"}
Your reflex's slow like a turtle
Yeah my picture you circle from papers and journals
Without rehearsal, my dispersal is the worst
A verse, I burst Swa
Into a million children
In Tiananmen buildings
Willing and start illing, comin thru the ceiling
Enough of this rhetoric let's start building

[Verse 1]
Yeah... KRS-One bout to wreck the joint
I was seen openin up at the edge of Detroit
Where the cops go beyond the laws
Where enemies work together by putting they shit on pause
So what does it mean, Assault on Precinct 13?
You are bout to see just what the dirt brings
It's working, that force, I have been searching
Like Lawrence Fishburne when it's time to hurt things
Ethan Hawke, man he face all that
I hold the mic like Ja held the baseball bat
I stay ahead, like a baseball cap
The ways of the world, Kris don't chase all that

[Chorus]
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?

[Verse 2]
Well as I walk through the street, my spirit will speak
To those I meet and great from week to week
I am not my handsome beat. I command the speak
As the observer inside the physique
Many rappers try to compete, of course
But they got smashed and trashed in the streets and tossed
Sometimes I think we all just lost
We just flashin and flossin the disasterous cause
We don't even know the one-ness of the only force
Instead of a golden calf, we got a platinum horse
But what did Moses do with the golden calf?
Threw the log at it and it ended in a blast
Master, get on them quick, get on them faster
In the background you frontin, cuz there's nothing but laughter
I tag church like the shirt king
Turn up the track for Assault on Precinct 13

[Chorus]
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?

[Verse 3]
Wow, what an ending. What a conclusion
They thought they was winning, but they really was losing
He though he was sinnin, but he really was proving
That leadership keeps it moving, steady cruising
Guns up, funds up, from sun up to sun up to sun up
Buck buck buck! Yo, duck duck
We run up, two down, one up
Dope MCs see me and get butterflies in they stomach
Others can't speak, they just shut up
KRS on the come up, liftin Big Pun up. Let me sum up
Dope MCs, wack MCs, thin MCs, fat MCs, commercial MCs
They can't all get done up
Raise the drum up, breath for breath, I'll rip your lung up
On my trophy wall, I'm nailing your tongue up
KRS-One, you know what it means
Turn up the track for Assault on Precinct 13

[Chorus]
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?

[Verse 4]
We gotta start trusting each other right now if we gonna make it
Through this night
From Criminal Minded to Spiritual Minded, and even beyond and behind it, never be afraid to fight
Or be the lazy type. Me, I'm the crazy type
I get them clubs so crazy hype
I throw them glasses on that them ladies like
And years later, rock what they babies like
I blaze the light, there me be 8,000,000 ways to die
But there's 16,000,000 ways to fight
So wherever you are,in the crib or your car, in your tank too
KRS-One would like to thank you, right
That's why KRS on the mic
Wishin you peace for the rest of the night
Cuz at the end of the film, you'll see what it mean
Turn up the track for Assault on Precinct 13!

Fresh (fresh)... For 2005... You suucckkkkaaaa!
All rise!

From around the way to around the world
The ever-sinner of Matthew Netta, gets it together
Every time I manifest the vocals we think
My voice is registered with your local presinct
I lead through knowledge, you don't see me till college
KRS-One is like that oatmeal porridge
When you get older and you realise you need it
That's when you retrieve it, now class be seated
This Boogie Down lingo is produced by Domingo
Wild styles I bring you, now go re-write your single
My last name should be Kringle for the gift
On the drummachine I program songs like Steve Smith
Don't Rif, Kin, you're not loud
You're not listening, I self-create my position
Any room I enter I transform to a church
Before you see through battle you should do some research
For we break

Samples:
-Has more rhymes than a train has tracks-
-Able to leave sucker MC's in a single rhyme-
Break-over, take-over, total make-over
When I rap it slabs a flack on your Range Rover
You's a joke clown plus you broke down
Like a coat of a cardigan KRS-One be flowing at your party
Your whole crew jetting they be seriously threating
My lyric weapon be upsetting the jamsession
Gather round now for a very important lesson
KRS-One is not the one you should be testing
No guessing, we follow strict mathematics
Temple tactics and word magic
So step up if you wanna get hurt
All year around our shows be worth
The force I observe lifts up your skirt
Leave your space cabin Captain Kirk covered in dirt

Samples:
-Has more rhymes than a train has tracks-
-Able to leave sucker MC's in a single rhyme- 2x

You got the long lasting, floors matching without asking
Rhymes with a passion, KRS-One, broadcasting
Never crashing cos I'm never speeding
You should be heading, what do you trick and I be reading
Leading the new school, with new rules for new fools
Flash styles and young MC's it makes they crews drool
Some say you cruel when I bust off like a new tool
Making a man you do as I drop two jewels
Positive and negative, mutualist disadditive, but I'm not giving it
The Godess is my relative, knowledge I be living it
I creep with it, come to elect ya and you'll witness it
Lyrics I'll be flicking it
Don't step this way if you begin in it
Push your hands up if you've been in it
Let me now get into it, straight rhymes hit the innercit'
When it splatter they say "Damn, those rappers"
Switching ya, fixing a glitch in ya
Pulling the bitch in ya out, taking a bum a ridiculour route
Samples:
-Has more rhymes than a train has tracks-
-Able to leave sucker MC's in a single rhyme- 4x

[Intro]
And the Cold Crush Brothers are here to do a sure shot throw down for their very best friends

Let's do it!

[Chorus: Cold Crush Brothers]
When I say "how" then you say "ho"
And if somebody say "thug" then you say so
'Cause there's hell below and you ain't trynna go
So get ready for the throw down
Heads catch wreck and bums get done
B.D.P., Cold Crush, KRS-One
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
So get ready for the throw down

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
Throw down, low down
MCs get thrown down
I mastered the sentence, paragraph, and pronouns
I think you oughta go now
You can't stand the blow of toe to toe now
That you heard all the rap criminals
Skills minimal, despicable
Check out the rhyme originals (Cold Crush!)
Indivisible with justice for all
Before ya learn to walk, you gots to learn to crawl
Before ya learn to crawl, you gots to be born
And before you were born, your folks had to get it on
The point to the matter comin' from the blast master
Is hip-hop culture might be headed for disaster
All these wack rappers don't know the past data
They act like hip-hop history doesn't matter
So when you see KRS-One brace the stage
The difference that you see has to do with my age
Fresh in '74, fresh in '75
Fresh in '76 when MCs rocked live to cassette
Fresh in '77, don't forget
Fresh in '78 on a turntable set
Fresh in '79, fresh in '80
I was Grandmaster G with my man Neville T
Fresh in '81, and fresh in '82
With DJ Mad Mike off of Church Avenue
In the BK, Brooklyn Flatbush
In the BK MCs got mushed
I was fresh in '83, '84 and '85
When I moved back to the BX and got live
Fresh in '86, fresh in '87
Fresh in '88 after Scott went to heaven
Fresh in '89, fresh in '90
I'm fresh in '91, '92 and '93
Fresh in '94 and '95, don't be forgetting
Fresh in '96 and fresher in '97
Fresh in '98 and fresh in '99
In the new millennium I'll be arousin' your mind, so

[Chorus: Cold Crush Brothers]
When I say "how" then you say "ho"
And if somebody say "thug" then you say so
'Cause there's hell below and you ain't trynna go
So get ready for the throw down
Heads catch wreck and bums get done
B.D.P., Cold Crush, KRS-One
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
So get ready for the throw down

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
What does it take to be a real MC?
It means you can't write rhymes for the TV
'Cause a real MC, whether amateurs or pros
Is an MC that knows how to rock live shows
Another thing, while I sing MC talk
A real MC never diss New York
'Cause if you knew the time while you're rhymin', MCin'
You'd know that New York is hip-hop's Garden of Eden
And if this ain't sacred, we never gonna make it
You're dissin' your very own hip-hop tradition
You know why when I grab the mic I'm superior?
'Cause I was at the Roxy and Danceteria
KRS, a product of respect and courtesy
While the rapper is a product of the record company
I'm not braggin' but this is what hip-hop is achievin'
It's becomin' all rap and no MCin'
Still we ain't seein', 'cause still we ain't believin'
The West and the East of hip-hop can cease

[Bridge: Cold Crush Brothers]
Hey y'all, yes it's true
The boys in blue got a plan for you
And don't mess with the suits 'cause they do too
So whatcha gonna do (Stop bitin' on my crew)
Try to be the best
Live positive and free from stress
And don't limit yourself to East or West
Who's the very best? (KRS)

[Verse 3: KRS-One]
I warm up your chest while your bones untangle
The lyrics hit your head then goes down your ankle
I'm saved for rainy days like casseroles
Then rediscovered later like the Dead Sea Scrolls
You wanna get out the ghetto, the projects, and profit
Well first, negativity, you gots to stop it
You can big up the East Coast and the West Coast
But you can't big up no coast when you're ghost
I can see now how the other man stole rock and roll
And guitar rippin', 'cause we was bullshitin'
Sittin', eatin' chicken, what fixes time tickin'
We spittin' and complainin', the world is rearrangin'
Still we doin' the same and who's to blame, we don't need this
It's not black strength, it's black weakness
Now we doin' the same and who's to blame, we don't need this
It's not black strength, it's black weakness

[Chorus: Cold Crush Brothers]
When I say "how" then you say "ho"
And if somebody say "thug" then you say so
'Cause there's hell below and you ain't trynna go
So get ready for the throw down
Heads catch wreck and bums get done
B.D.P., Cold Crush, KRS-One
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
So get ready for the throw down

[all] South South, Bronx!

[KRS] C'mon let's bring it back

[all] South South, Bronx!

[KRS-One]
Raw rhymes for raw times
My albums are underground, but this blessing is all mine
And when it's tour time, we open more minds
You need to rethink who you think is the "Greatest of All Time"
I got this -- I'm raw like Freddie Foxxx is
Hardcore like The LOX is, Scott LaRock is where 2Pac is
Where hip-hop is, Digital-ly Underground like Shock is
Oh yes -- I know where the top is
But I'd rather rhyme about how crooked some of these cops is
My synopsis ain't pretty
I'd stay, off them plains and, out the city if I were you
Do what you gotta do
But while you wave them flags, remember Amadou .. Diallo
Here's what we gotta do, follow
I'll put hip-hop in you if you're hollow
Those that already filled, STILL take swallows
Goin over potholes with Tahoes
You don't think +I+ know?  Huh!  I'm lookin at you right now
You ain't dancin in the club, you in your car, sittin down
You in the crib, on the low
You got them headsets on the go
You just saw me at the show - oh you don't know?
It's the Temple of Hip-Hop, comin, with a whole DIFFERENT flow
Yo where them hoes at?  I don't know
But wherever God at, I'mma go
I give 'em a hard rap AND a flow
That's why when they call back for the show, with no video
We get up and go!

[Hook: repeat 2X]

[KRS] Yo where it started at?

[KRS] Yo where my people at?

[KRS] C'mon let's bring it back

[all] South South, Bronx!

[KRS-One]
Peep it out while I tell ya like this
In every single hood in the WORLD I'm called Kris
It's the, truth for ya, it's the proof for ya
My Cristal passes more bars than lawyers
The underground sound, this is not easily found
You don't need no rings to be down
This is, past the platinum and gold
We already had 'em, it's old
Here's the truth if it be told, gather 'round
Philosopher style is known to be wild
If you only holdin them guns, who's holdin your child?
You got to be thinkin you KNOW that you shrinkin
When the art of Navigation has been reduced to a Lincoln
Change the dial!  I was free then and I'm free now
You free, runnin to MTV?  I don't see how!
You know the real from the fake, you know they stealin they cake
You know it ain't about the art, it's all about what they make
You know the radio's late, you know they play what you hate
That's why you got that Kay Slay tape, tryin to escape
You know the love of the cars and the rims
Tattooed arms and Timbs, are also called sins
You know you got to pay for these spins
You know the rap magazines be wack from beginning to the end
BO!

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
I never was a king and I'm not the Pres
I'm a teacher like that reefer goin straight to your head
I'm a preacher tryin to bring my people back from the dead
I'm a leader tryin to keep you all away from the feds
You my sister I'll be tryin to get you OUT of the bed
I'm a philospher sayin what has GOT to be said
I don't FILL you with lead, I bring that KNOWLEDGE instead
FOLLOW this dread, I'll take you from A to Zed
Who am I?  Just a scholar called K-R-S
You can spend your money on others but THEY AIN'T BLESSED
You can spend your money drugs and STILL BE STRESSED
Look around for conscious rappers yo there AIN'T NONE LEFT
I'm holdin it down; better yet I'm holdin up
Waitin for some young buck to come and sip from the cup
And continue with the menu puttin new knowledge in you
I got a question and a lesson cause I KNOW what you been through
But..

[all] South South, Bronx!

[KRS] C'mon let's bring it back!!
The South South Bronx, boyeee..

[KRS-One]
Uhh! They don't wanna battle
They ain't ready for the battle, uh-uh, uh-uh (Temple of Hip-Hop)
Listen, listen, listen

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Your spirit AIN'T READY
Your church AIN'T READY
Your bishop AIN'T READY
Your deacons AIN'T READY
Your choir AIN'T READY
Your ushers AIN'T READY
At the Temple of Hip-Hop
WE TEACH MANY!

[KRS-One]
Look! To all my people hurtin, all my people searchin
What we know for sure, God is always workin
Workin while you flirtin, workin while you jerkin
Workin while the world is turnin and these cities burnin
God is always workin, workin while you learnin
Workin while you ignorant and when you're not concernin
Christ consciousness, get that, got that
Spit that, rock that, hip that, hop that
You sniff that? Stop that, I give back and got back
Greedy? I'm not that, you needy for that shock rap
Slangin on the block rap, duckin where the cops at
I don't know that, but Jesus done copped that
Not that man on the cross, it ain't like that
You must act like the son of God, that's where the lights at
Stop readin only and start bein show me
Like the resurrection I'll be back, they can't hold me

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
One thing's for sure and believe it hurt
It's when the pastor ain't sure, and deceives the church
They don't know God's law, and can't see God at work
So when they see hip-hop, they push it to the back of the church
Like fig trees or figures they don't bear fruit
They gospel artists, still tryin to chase that loot
Hear the truth now, I come to enhance the light
They women of God, singin while they pants is tight?
They not hot! Really they, regular
They clothes they flows, all that, secular
What's the difference I could stay in the world and wild
If these church girls wear more makeup than Destiny's Child
Keep it real Christian, some of y'all liftin ain't likin
But this is the difference between a Christian and a Christ-ian
Stop readin only and start bein show me
Like the resurrection I'll be back, they can't hold me
.. listen, listen, listen

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
Look! Spiritual minded, you must find it
Find your spirit and go deep inside it
This goes out to the Christians listenin
This is the flow that, gospel's missin it's
Urban inspirational rap
We got our own section in the record stores, in our own rack
We respect tradition from the start
But we now know the true word of God is written in our heart
We gotta say something to the streets kid!
All these churches surrounding the Devil still ain't defeat it?
They the type to get down, I'm the type to get up
From "Criminal" to "Spiritual Minded", now raise your head up
Let me start, these rappers ain't got God in they heart
All they want is quick money and a movie part
Let me begin, what, where, why or when
What's the use of double platinum if you're living in sin
Hear the truth, how long you think you gonna last
Rockin the mic, without having to go back to class?
Now you're forced, to listen to the teacher out rap them
Yes there's life after platinum

[Repeat 2X - *sung*]
Lord live within my heart.. Lord don't you ever stop..
Fill me up with what I need.. just have to ask I shall receive..

[KRS-One]
Look, look!
Ba-bi-di-ba-bi-dang-a-dang-diggy
How many rappers can actually hang with me?
My style is that Kris-style, it's witty
In they style, I have no more Faith like Biggie
I battle on many levels, I shatter so many devils
'Fore you challenge me you better know the essentials
It's the K to the R to the S, to the uno
You know, if you don't know your crew know
When you hear the thunderin sound, you under the ground
You can tell by the way we jumpin around
It's the teacher, breakin it down
I'm an upright MC, these others they be crawlin around, word

[Repeat 2X - *sung*]
Lord live within my heart.. Lord don't you ever stop..
Fill me up with what I need.. just have to ask I shall receive..

[KRS-One]
Yeah yeah, word up, look, look!
You know when the teacher returns, just get ready to learn
Just get ready to earn, health, love
Awareness and money to burn, I'm not really concerned
How the Benz just turn, 'round the corner
For our sons and daughters to yearn, stand firm
If you lookin at these hooks you becomin a mad worm
Danglin from the pole of the fisher, the corporate fisher
The talent scout and no doubt ready to get ya!

[Repeat 1X - *sung*]
Lord live within my heart.. Lord don't you ever stop..
Fill me up with what I need.. just have to ask I shall receive..

[KRS-One]
Look look look look!
I'm anything BUT regular, not even similar
I get rid of the SIN in ya when I spit at ya, my new literature
Now who forever been with ya? THE TEACHER!
Who remembers the kid in ya? THE TEACHER!
I'm winnin ya, or winnin a convert when the rhyme splurt at the concert
Forget the times that hurt, if the mind's alert let the mind work
Uh! Let the body divert
To get to the top of the mountain, you've got to climb dirt
So c'mon climb through, don't get stuck lookin behind you
It'll blind you, however I'm here to remind you
Many of you lost you've got to find you
You'll be found you simply by you finding you, c'mon!

[Repeat 4X - *sung*]
Lord live within my heart.. Lord don't you ever stop..
Fill me up with what I need.. just have to ask I shall receive..
You think this is easy right? (Yeah!)
You think this is easy right? (That's easy!)
You think you got what it takes? (Yeah that's easy!)
Huh, we gon' see.. we gon' see right now (Now what?)
Look

[KRS-One]
So you wanna be a conscious rapper
Can you handle the press and they negative chatter
Can you eat cold platters, and still spit data
Watchin others spit lies and they pockets get fatter
Can you climb up the ladder, and reach the top?
But it still doesn't matter, cause you ain't pop
Can you rock for the love of the art
Can you drop hit after hit after hit and still don't chart?
Can you REALLY stay loyal to God
When your life is full of strife, plus it always seems so hard
Can you handle the criticism
People holdin you up to higher standards, but they don't live 'em?
Can you hear these kiddy flows and laugh at it
But when you spit they callin you arrogant?
You better think about that before you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to pop your Cris', let's do it!

[Hook: *sung*]
Think you can do what I do
Think you can step in my shoes
You have no clue what I go through
You never felt my pain
When they attack my name
All because I have spoken the truth

[KRS-One]
To be a conscious rapper ain't a mystery
You gotta laugh when they call you contradictory
The whole industry, you gotta push and pull it
To really get with me, you gotta dodge they bullets
Blaow, blaow, blaow, every day and every way
You critics got somethin to say
At the same time, you gotta uphold Christ
Uphold life, while others flash cars and ice
It could break you down, take you down, make you frown
It could actually shake your ground
But if you love who you are, and believe in that
Best believe you will BE where the teacher's at
And where's that? In fact, in cold or heat
Yes, I declare victory over the streets
Overstand, over these beats, over the so-called elite
Over the strong, over the weak
I know how to speak, and most of all I know how to eat
I know I want humble and meek
So you better think about that before you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to pop your Cris', uhh

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
Look!
So you thinkin about bein a concious MC
Well you gotta love God and you got to live free
You got to see the life that others can't see
You got to be the person that others can't be
You can't be a S-L-A, V-E
If you sayin to yourself, "This may be me"
Then you know goin in that you work against sin
Your very skills will kill the demons within
So don't expect respect from slaves and hoes
Nor the slavemaster's video shows
Nor the rap mags, you know how it go
Nor the slavemaster's video shows
Nor the rap mags, you know how it go
Especially black mags, you know they don't know
Just go to the crowd that you know will need you
Cause NOTHING compares to the respect of the people
That's what you look for, that's what you work with
Cause anything else, is truly worthless
You better think about that before you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to just pop your Cris'
You better think about that, 'fore you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to just pop your Cris', uhh

[Hook] - repeat 2X
You ready to go? I'm ready to go
What about y'all, y'all ready to go? (yeah aight yeah) I'm ready to go
Look

[Repeat 3X]
Know thy self, and thou shalt know
The universe and God (whoa-ohh-ohh)

God is the mother, the father, the friend
Know ye not that ye must be born again?
What does it mean to be in the world but not of it
It means you want the cars the cash the jewels the house but you don't love it
It means to taxes regulation state law you live above it
It means you a FREE hip-hopper, you ain't nobody's puppet
You don't see no money on me, you see it up in the cupboard
You see me up in Toys'R'Us, with my seeds cause they love it
You see insurance flash out, if my kids pass out
You see seven acres of land where we can all spaz out
To all my fathers that fathered, hold your head up for starters
Teach your toddlers, not to be thieves and robbers
This that other kind of rap, that leads to true hip-hop
There's other kinds of raps, but they lead you to get shot
The choice is yours, you gettin older now
You got a kid comin, how you gonna hold it down?
It's one thing to be iced out and rocked up
What's the point if you're gettin locked up?

[Repeat 3X]
Know thy self, and thou shalt know
The universe and God (whoa-ohh-ohh)

God is the mother, the father, the friend
Know ye not that ye must be born again?
It's really time we seperate the young men from the big men
The young girls from the women, whatever the title that fit them
My style designed to open a child's mind when I spit them
I only got a little bit of time to really rhyme and uplift them
You see them brothers talkin about that crime? Forgive them
It won't be long before they words manifest and they live them
Sometimes you gotta go back to the beginnin to learn
After fifteen years I'm just BEGINNIN to burn
To all my true hip-hoppers, that pay bills and live proper
Never allow a negative thought to stop ya
Correct ya posture, stand upright not uptight
Don't be scared of the light, just prepare for the fight
We say "Criminal Minded", cause our thoughts are illegal
We represent the very thinkin of, inner-city people
Real people, people that take care of theyself
They need health, love, awareness and wealth
Not to mention, knowledge of God
Not college, the job then dead - if you agree nod your head
It's one thing to be iced out and rocked up
But what's the point if you're gettin locked up?

[Repeat 3X]
Know thy self, and thou shalt know
The universe and God (whoa-ohh-ohh)

God is the mother, the father, the friend
Know ye not that ye must be born again?
C'mon c'mon yo, tonight is it
We gonna steal away together, through these rhymes I spit
When the student is ready, the teacher, shall appear
So I'm here, but are you really ready to face your fears?
Mo' money, mo' money, is that your credo?
You've been livin in a dream world Neo, power to the people!
Nobody's equal, everybody's diversed and different
My lyric'll never cheat you, my verse is gifted
So manifest what you believe is God almighty
It could be Allah Jesus Krishna Buddha Aphrodite
It could be Nefretire come hear me and never fear me
It's like at some point in your life you gonna have to hear me
I represent them teachers preachers comin through your speaker
Manifestin another lesson to them true believers
Instead of pickin up our women ready to mistreat 'em
You better get yourself a wife and kid and never leave 'em
You better teach 'em you better read 'em you better feed 'em
The system will defeat 'em if you don't teach 'em the cops'll beat 'em
The style that I be kickin quick is "Edutainment"
Hip-Hop culture needed a teacher quick so I became it
Instead of rhymin about my history and what I been through
I'd rather rhyme about awakening the God within you
Yo, it's one thing to be iced out and rocked up
But what's the point if you're gettin locked up?

[Repeat 3X]
Know thy self, and thou shalt know
The universe and God (whoa-ohh-ohh)

God is the mother, the father, the friend
Know ye not that ye must be born again?

[KRS-One]
Yeah.. yeah.. FRESH, for two-thousand and two
My sisters and BROTHERS, my sisters and BROTHERS.. {*repeats to fade*}

[KRS-One]
Yeah, once again, word up urban inspirational
KRS-One, Professor Ecks, whattup Dan? Woo
Temple of Hip-Hop, let's do it

By the sound of the track, you know who is back
It's the teacher, philosopher of conscious rap
Rappers tired of me sayin where hip-hop is at
Cause they know they unoriginal, copycats
Watch me bump this gospel rap, never wack
In fact, I tell you where the tracks is at
TV is wack, they wanna show us beatin Iraq
When the question is, is where is Chandra Levy at?

[Professor Ecks]
Murdered God and left for dead like hip-hop
And admit to Condit like conduct, to kill Ecks the dread
And Kris crucified the false prophet
John F. Kennedy to these MC's, I draw and cock it
Cock on cocky cops for the love of the art
Punish the part, partition
Pardon the pause, poison pens penetrate the mental
I walk with Kris so my body's a temple
Body instrumentals and body your squad in the body of a God

[KRS-One]
Just think, just think, what if Malcolm X returned
Or Dr. King returned, tell me what have we learned?
As we takin our turn, tell me what have we earned
Or is the ice and the cars our only concern
Mo' money, mo' money, you be yellin it out
And on TV can't you see you be sellin us out
So in 2010, look to 2002
Who you think they gonna respect, me or you?

[Professor Ecks]
Behold, the God, in the form of the man
Walkin off water and (?) flesh absorbs in the sand
Moor gets the land, divorcin the clan, I'm off into sand
Off and I'm slayin delicate arms from porcelain hands
Slaughtered the lambs, charge it to the game
Cats take hip-hop's name in vain
Disrespectin the forefathers who came (uh-huh)
Goddess hurt 'em right now, like when Marvin was slain

[KRS-One]
They don't want it, nope, they don't need it, nope
Just stay weeded and hope, I don't read what you wrote
Best believe they ain't dope, they deceivin these folks
With they meaningless quotes, I got my feet on they throat
What they speak is a joke, they really weak and they broke
Have a seat and take notes, on the streets I'm the Pope
MTV is they hope, they repeat what they wrote
I'm an MC that won't, let them tempt me with coke

[Professor Ecks]
Nope, flesh of my flesh, blessed by KRS
Used to love her, they (?) haven't made a date with death
Follow no man, enslave the Ecks, Professin the student
I vibe with the teacher obliged to drop (?) liver than heaters
Lyrics liable to eat us like the survivors of Jesus
Now the, blind is the leaders, your styles is egregious
Gets now the brow beateth to underground emceeth
The game is overheated, overweeded, and misunderstood

[KRS-One]
Word, just a ride in they boat, with a platinum rope
No doubt, they sellin us out, what's happenin loc?
Quit this rappin I won't, cause MC'n is dope
If I can't do it for the love then do it I won't
How many times we note when these rappers is dope
Satisfied, that's why I'm renewin your hope
Broaden your scope, when cleaned out your mind
My rhyme is like a new bar of deoderant soap

[Professor Ecks]
In this land of men mice and mimes, I holds right for the laws
Live life like Christ, makin bread from mics and applause
The snakes fight with Tyson like jaws for what's rightfully yours
I might (?) 'em all, tell me - is it life or it's war?

[*singer*]
Goooyyyyiiyyyiyyyyod, Goooyyyiyyiyyyiiiod, Gooyyyyiyyiyyyod
My God, your God, our God.. is God, is God
Change is gonna come, where you goin to run, but to God?
To God, run to God, run to God
Run to God, and let him in your heart
Change is gonna come, the change is gonna come
Make it your change, run to God, in your heart
Let God in your heart, he will fillt he part
Goooyyyyiiyyyiyyyyod, in youuuuuuur heart
Take it to God, take it to God God
Take it to my God, your God, take it to God
Take it to Goooyyyyiiyyyiyyyyod, take it to Goooyyyyiiyyyiyyyyod
Take it to Goooyyyyiiyyyiyyyyod, take it to God
Just take it to God, run and, take it God
Take it to Go-awd
"At midday today, some Americans attended memorial services
For victims of Tuesday's acts of terrorism. Thousands
Gathered at Chicago's Daily Plaza. Hundreds more looked
On from the windows of surrounding office buildings
Many waved flags, and traffic came to a complete standstill
On the rooftop of City Hall, which faces Daily Plaza, a
Police sharpshooter watched the crowd, even as he saluted
The flag. After a minute of silence, church bells rang."

{Ain't no need in all the tears, oh no no, yeah yeah
Yeah cause things will be better tomorrow}

[Hook: repeat 2X *sung*]
No need for tears, no need to cry
No matter what we face, we shall get by
When the problems you face are too much to bear
Know I'll be there

[KRS-One]
Hold that head up y'all, don't get fed up y'all
C'mon let's get up y'all
Make that bed up y'all, life is a set-up y'all
Sadness comes from a lack of knowin, not knowin
Where the one that you love is goin
We all gonna reap what we all are sewin
There is no death, just constant growin
We can't stay here forever
We all gotta go to a place we believe is better
So why be sad, why be mad
Now you can see it ain't about the cheddar
It's all about the time that we spend together
Not the rhyme or the crime or the Gucci sweater
The house that's built on a rock can stand the weather
Faith, can stand the weather
But is your house, upon the rock
Or is it on sand and about to drop
Here is the question that you got to ask
Do I live for today or do I live for the past?
Think fast, but do not hurry
Life is a class and we should not worry
But tell me, how long you gonna ignore
Tell me how long you gonna ignore God's law?
How long can you really endure
Livin like pimps, livin like whores
The choice is yours, or really ours
Think about this while you lay the flowers
On the grave, uh, let's talk about how you behave, uh
Do you come out the neighb' or out the cave?
Better change your ways, we comin up on some stranger days

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
Uhh, uhh
Don't step where the danger lays or danger lies
Open them EYES UP, better to RISE UP, WISE UP
Raise your MINDS UP
Look to the left, look to the right
Pray in the day and the night
Be prepared for the fight, not scared of the fight
He's the way, the truth AND the light
J to the E to the S to the U to the S
You can remove the stress
Yes, we do need you here
Yes, we wanna be free from fear
Yes, we wanna start seein clear
Havin you here, not over there
Lookin around sayin where, does anybody care?
Yeah, I'll be there
At the door, not at the war
At Matthew 5:44
"But I say, unto you
Love your enemies, bless them that curse you
Do good to them that hate you
And pray for them which despitefully use you
And persecute you"
This goes for them terrorists too
But them publicans, done put themSELVES up above again
Lookin for blood again, hate no love again
Got them soldiers runnin in, with a gun again
With a ton of sin, in a holy war, how we gonna win?
I think it's time for KRS-One again

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[KRS-One]
The time is now, you gotta make your choice
Which side are you on? Turn now to Matthew 5:46
"For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye?
Do not even the publicans the same?
And if ye salute your breddern only, what do ye more than others
Do not even the publicans so? Be ye therefore perfect;
Even as your FATHER which is in heaven, is perfect.." {*echoes*}

[KRS-One]
C'mon, gather round now, gather round now, look now
How many times did you pre-meditate
What you thought was your fate, cause you couldn't just wait
You had to have it the way that you thought in your mind
But in the end, everything came in time
But before the time, you was losin your mind
You was racin and rushin and fallin behind
But let me tell you bout God and the way that She works
I mean the way that He works, I mean the way that We work
You gotta trust in your Lord, everything is in accord
Don't rush or fuss, you gonna get yours
Close your eyes, your heart, your ears, your mind
To the ways and thoughts of mankind
And seek ye first the Kingdom of God
And things won't seem so hard
You gotta trust your Lord, uhh, uhh.. tell 'em bout

[Hook]
Trust and obey, trust when afraid
Trust when you paid, trust when betrayed
Trust when you fear, trust when you unclear
Trust when you here, trust when you near
Trust when you down, trust when you found
Trust when you clown, trust
C'mon, let's do it again, uh, uh
Let's raise it up, c'mon, look

[KRS-One]
After you live and you learn then you see
You will learn how to trust in your G-O-D
You will be so free, you won't see no me
You will only see the will of the almighty
You sick of what? Well ya will, give it up
Stop thinkin and begin to, live it up
Everytime you think it's one way it's not
Everytime you wanna start you really stop
Trust in the inner the outer is for the sinners
In fact this whole rap is for beginners
Those that have talked and walked upon the path
Know that they get what they want before they act
So why rush, if your respect is due
Whatever you DON'T have is protectin you
Here's what you DO have that be bringin the drama
Ask and it shall be given, with a comma

[Hook]

{*singers*}
You trust in her, trust in him, trust in them, and then
Trust in men, trust in sin, trust in friends
You trust in her, trust in him, trust in them, and then
Trust in men, trust in sin, trust in friends

[KRS-One]
Uh uh, soundin good, soundin good, look, look
So when will you be it, when will you see it
That thoughts and things they manifest when you decree it
But God be lookin out for you
Puttin a stop to what you're about to do
In your life, and in your circumstances
Everytime you speak you be takin chances
Talkin bout things that you really don't have to have
So when you get 'em, your life turns sad
Your life turns bad, now why would your God be allowin that?
Trust in God, that's where the crown is at
It's not in what you get, it's what happens after that
So if you think your life is shrinkin
It may be cause you keep thinkin
Not that intellect is wrong
It's just the beginning, it might be time to move on

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
Y'all don't know?  Y'all don't know your body is a temple?
A temple to the living God?  Don't get gassed y'all
All my sisters out there, here's the truth
You, a you've got to.. {TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME}
Look, look!

You don't want no unsteady relationships, you want it tight
You don't want no man beggin and always gonna get, am I right?
You don't want no man sleepin cheatin freakin behind his wife
There's no such thing as make love, it's really make life
I don't care what nobody say; you sleep with a man, that's your husband
So make sure, before you lay down, you love him
And learn him, yes it's still sacred to be a virgin
Relax, it's curiosity that always burns 'em in fact
Sex is like candy, be disciplined, no splurgin
You don't want your stomach hurtin
Girl, you gotta.. {TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME}
Listen!

Cash is an issue with that he can never diss you
Even if he makes you cry, you bought your own tissue
Witcha own case, witcha own hand, wipe ya own face
And throw him out, no doubt, out of your own place
If your heart is broken you can mend it
If you're independent, your womanhood, that's when you defend it
Just.. uhh, just {TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME} woo!
Look!
{TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME}

Don't come witcha hand always out
If he buys you somethin thank him, but that's not what a man is about
Real men are real friends, showin their real commitment
He tells you he really loves you, a boy can't really admit it
If a man really wants you, that man really flaunts you
In public or private a real man really supports you
'Member what Guru taught you?  Of course you "Royalty"
You dress how you like when a QUEEN is what you ought to be
And ought to act like, and also ought to manifest
How you dress makes you constantly blessed, or constantly stressed
{TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME} Yo!

{TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME}

Yo, yo
So while you burnin off those calories, think about reality
Get a skill for the salary, a man for the family
Not a boy, that's a catastrophe, don't get mad at me
Instead of always clubbin visit museums and art galleries
Pick the single man, admirin the ancient sculpture
He's cultured, chances are he won't insult ya
Give him your number only after you know what he does
Ask him what it is, not what it was
You want the good life (GOOD LIFE)
You want the good life (GOOD LIFE)
You want the, you want the, you want the
C'mon, you gotta {TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME}

Word up

[Hook]
I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've got-ta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me

[Verse 1]
Let's come together once and for all
Before our children cannot walk in the mall
Before we can not talk or walk at all
Already aviation is stalled
Now everybody wants to drive, bringing our highways to a crawl
Just about three weeks on back
I was talking to a journalist about my album, the Sneak attack
Now I know, why I felt that way
Why the cards God revealed to me was dealt that way
Be prepared for the unexpected, that was the theme
But if your booty's shaking, you can't know what that means
Look, we all, in the, same, game
It's that world bank game that got struck with two flame
But we, yes the people, are struck with true pain
Coz the world Bank'll do the same under a new name
We gotta recognize the prize, and the people at the door
No more lies, you can no longer ignore

[Hook]
I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've got-ta see yourself in victory
The respect I give to you, you give to me

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've got-ta see yourself in victory
The respect I give to you, you give to me

[Verse 2]
I know 

[Know what?]
I know! 

[What you know?]
What do I show? 

[What you show?]
Capitvating lyrical flow!

[They don't play it on radio!]
Yeah, but the spirit know
But only a few can hear it though
The metaphysical lyrical blow
The minute you're in it and hear it, yo
See the evil and clear it, yo
See that for as many that died there was twice as many miracles
Uh, So let the dead bury their dead
Life is but a dream, and in the dream we gotta get ready for bed
Better we look ahead instead, to the ones that survived
Pray for them too, coz there grace of God kept them alive
Yes we mourn for the dead and will still kill for them
But what about the injured that must still rebuild again?

[Hook]
I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've got-ta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've got-ta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me

[Verse 3]
To all the people, that never lost someone
Consider the cost of the loss of a lost daughter or son
These cowards slaughter and run
And to know that there's more than just one
Makes you wanna store up your gun
And withdraw all the funds, but

[Hook]
I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've got-ta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've got-ta see yourself in victory
The respect I give to you, you give to me

[KRS-One]

All I wanna do is recite my poetry

(Alright, check it out..)
Well my ladies and gentlemen
This is a rapsession and my name is "KRS-One!"
And when I talk about "Hip-Hop Music!", I know

[Kris]
One : Breaking or breakdancing
Really b-boying, freestyle, street dancin'
Two : MC'ing or rap
Divine speech what I'm doing right now, no act
Three: Grafitti art or burning, bombin'
Taggin', writin', now you're learning! uh!
Four : DJ'ing, we ain't playing!
{*scratch*} You know what I'm saying!
Five : Beatboxing
Give me a {*beatboxin*} Yes and we rockin'!
Six : Street fashion, lookin' fly
Catchin' the eye while them cats walk on by
Seven: Street language, our verbal communication
Our codes throughout the nation
Eight: Street knowledge, common sense
The wisdom of the elders from way back whence
Nine : Street entrepreneurialism
No job, just get up call 'em and get 'em
Here's how I'm tellin' it, all 9 Elements
We stand in love, no we're never failing it
Intelligent? No doubt
Hip-Hop? We're not selling it out, we're just lettin' it out
If you're checkin' us out this hour, we teatchin' hip-hop
Holy Integrated People Having Omnipresent Power!

[Hook]
Rap is something you do!
3x Hip-Hop is something you live! *scratched*
Rap is something you do!
Hip-Hop is something you live! *scratched*

[Kris]
Skaters, BMX-bike riders rock
Don't you ever stop! You are hip-hop
You doing the same things we did on our block in the suburbs
You know you be packing that black block
Selling that crackrock and ecstasy
Gettin' pissydrunk, fallin' out next to me
But like I told those in the ghettoes
Here's the facts! True hip-hop is so much more than that
Some much more than rap, so much more than beats
Hip-hop is all about victory over the streets
What you see on TV is a lie
That's not something you wanna live or pattern your life by
But, huh that's too much preachin' ain't it?
You don't want the edutainment, you wanna be dead on the pavement
Well, so be it, some of ya'll ain't gonna see it
Others wanna enslave your mind! Kris wanna free it!

[Hook]
Rap is something you do!
5x Hip-Hop is something you live! *scratched*

"Oh yea" *scratched* --- From "P is dead"

"I have spent my whole life livin'", "hip hop to the fullest", "no doubt"

[Kris]
You know that's why these rappers can't hang
Cause the essence of hip-hop is not a material thing
They so careless, hip-hop is in awareness we give
Rap we do, hip-hop we live
How many times I gotta say it? How long the radio ain't gonna play it
And you hip-hoppers sit back and okay it
Think about it! (think about it)
The present course of action, we have got to reroute it!

[Hook: repeat 3X]
Hip-Hop is something you live!

[Hook]
Ya feel dat? (HO!) Ya see dat? (HO!)
Ya hear dat? (HO!) You believe dat? (HO!)
Ya follow dat? (HO!) Could it be dat? (HO!)
Ya follow dat? (HO!) Can you believe dat? (HO!)
Ya hear dat? (HO!) Ya see dat? (HO!)
You believe dat? (HO!) You can feel dat (HO!)
Ya follow dat? (HO!) You believe dat? (HO!)
Ya see dat? (HO!)

[Verse One]
Show me an MC that think he's too hot
Bring him to KRS-One, I'll show him he's NOT
Blowin the whole spot up when I spit up
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, when I walk past, get up
My wrists ain't lit up! I don't even live that life
Gold, diamonds, platinum, I give to my wife - you see
Diamonds are a girl's best friend, not mine
You got it, FINE - but what about that rhyme?
Can you rhyme? Can you spit it quick
Like watermelon pits at a picnic? Ha!
Or are you just dressed up with nowhere to go?
Or is the record company the pimp and you the ho?
LET'S GO!

[Hook] w/ variations

[Verse Two]
I write my own books like I write my own hooks
Step in the spot and these rappers be so shook
They don't look here cause KRS is BOOM!
Platinum rappers be hidin out in they dressin rooms
Yo, get away from me
You got a million dollar video but I'm the one they wanna see
The capital E-M-C-E-E
A repitition of words, I been divorced Melodie
I'm out, confident, no doubt
I get what I gotta get when I spit I don't shout
This New Yorker, Kris Parker's a quick talker
You can get what I spit or get the klik-klocker
Overseas I got the breeze as a hip-hopper
Where they speak eat and drop the beats proper
Street doctor, I'm +Brown+ and +Foxy+ like the +Ill Nana+
Whoever you think is hot, I'm hotter

[Hook] w/ variations

[Verse Three]
RADIO! These suckers never play me
Or Chuck - but do you think we really give a...
Southside, Westside, Eastside, North
I spit the hot flame, you get your flesh torn off
I come from that place where you cats can't face
Where cops can't chase or invade my space
We turn up the bass, you tremble in the place
Phones ain't traced and flows we don't waste
Hoes we don't chase or kiss, they know they place
With Kris or Christ, they'll lose their life
You don't lose if you come in two's, you and a wife
But you crews wanna be bruised, so choose your knife
Choose your gat, choose your rat, when the smoke clears
You'll be like, "God damn - who was that?"
Loosen that noose around your neck and back
Embarassin blacks, ain't no respect in that!

[Hook] w/ variations

[KRS-One]
Let's do it! (HO!) (HO!) (HO!) (HO!)
Everybody up top! (HO!) (HO!) (HO!) (HO!)
Yo, all my cats in the front! (HO!) (HO!) (HO!) (HO!)
Yo, yo, all my cats in the back (HO!) (HO!) (HO!) (HO!)
Yo, we out!

[Hook]
I've got the illest live show (Now what you sayin?)
I drop the illest rhyme flow (Now what you sayin?)
But you still want to act like you don't know
Well, that's alright with me
People sample me like James Brown (Now what you sayin?)
When they want to hear that (donk-a-donk) sound (Now what you sayin?)
But you still want to put me down
Well, that's alright with me

[Verse One]
The Kristyles is officially on blast
Don't worry about what he say, cause he won't last
If you want to learn the way take a seat in this class
I write albums like singles and release them so fast
I get around the whole country on foot like Flash
I don't fly across country I be there with the mass
Drivin, drivin, pulling up to your hood spot
You sayin to your son, "now this how radio should rock."
I pray for these radio cats cuz they don't know
How fast I be movin when they be movin slow
This ain't no fast food rap dude, get it and go
This that home cooked type meal, lyrical flow
Spiritual grow, ya know cuz ya was there, fo sho
Like Joey Greck I'm not the average Joe
(Yo, welcome cats to the BDP show
With KRS, Kenny Parker, G Simone, and Chalk-o)

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
I spit when I speak, when I speak I spit
When I spit what I spat it splits ya clique
Spit, spat, speak, spoke, either way
I spat that your rap's not dope any way
When you spoke I spit that splattered your scope
I split that and spit that unanimous quote
No hope when I battle I'm staggering folk
They slip-sliding away there rappers ain't dope
Get my coat, I make sure you can see shells
For sure you gon' see them cuz all you see is sales
Forget it you ain't wit it, admit it
Every thing you did I already did it

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Too many emcees not enough time
Nine out of ten niggas say they wanna rhyme
Four out of nine talk about drugs and crime
Three out of four say they wit it but they not
Two out of five spit fire plus the underground
One out of three spit righteous but they never shine
One out of two claim they ballin all the time
And only one make it to prime
Do that math, only one Biggie, one Pac, one Jay-Z
One Nas, one Fifty, one X, one Slim Shady
One KRS-One, one L, one K, one Busta, one Pun, one Love, only one me
Take that TNT, that spit is my property
You copy me, fuck you, pay me (nigga)

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
Gather 'round, gather 'round, ha
Metaphysical style, spiritual style, the ORIGINAL style, ha
Yes.. let's do it

[Hook]
- you can never give up, you should never give up
- you can never give up, we can never give up
- you can never give up, you can never give up
- you should never give up, we can never give up, you can never give up

[KRS-One]
Yeah, yeah
Y'all don't really know about the KRS rap
Y'all don't really about why we stay trapped
Y'all don't really know hip-hop ain't rap
But let me tell you how we can get it all back
First realize givin up is wack
Say to yourself I can never be wack
Then realize that we must go back
And the reason you can't seem to get on track
Is you, keep, buying, HOES, simple and plain
You, keep, buying, HOES, all y'all know my name
And how I get down and move around
I've already been to the proving ground
In conscious rap, who rule the sound
The question is are you down?

[Hook] w/ minor variations

[KRS-One]
Look - KRS-One, I've learned already
Everything they doin is temporary
No matter how big you live
You still the creation of a music executive
And when you get old no matter what you did
They throw you away and they pimp your kid
Yeah kids, on the TV whylin
You know why we got racial profilin?
Cause you, keep, buying, HOES, simple and plain
You, keep, buying, HOES, all y'all know my name
So there in the future we'll look back
And then we will see we were under attack
But it'll be too late, the loss'll be too great
You'll see, just wait!

[Hook] w/ minor variations

[KRS-One]
C'mon, c'mon, yeah c'mon
You see how they shuttin down KRS-One
Cause I'm not sexy, thuggin or dumb
Ask yourself -
- why they only promotin criminal activity and nothin else?
On the videos and on the radio
Teachin our kids which way to go
And the way that they tell our kids to go
If you listen, heads right straight to prison
While you, keep, buying, HOES, simple and plain
You, keep, buying, HOES, y'all better peep the game
You got to release that temptation
Get a brand new affirmation
Your life is what you make 'em
Peace, salaam alaikum

[Hook] w/ minor variations

[KRS-One]
Where the real at!
Where the real at!
Yeah!

[KRS-one]
Yo
Where I come from gats bust for nothin'
Thugs, ministers, cops, teachers, all be hustlin'
Your family's the only one ya trustin'
Clubs be jumpin', redesigned cars be bumpin'
Now there's ranks supreme KRS is a free man
In Hip-Hop culture, I'm like Allen Greenspan
I tell the culture what's hot and what's not
Now look who's on top and look whose shit just dropped
We ain't about sellin' records, we ain't music merchants
We emcees we go straight to the club and hurt shit

[Hook]
New York, New Jers', Boston, COME ON!
California, D.C., Baltimore, COME ON!
Texas, Atlanta, New Orleans, COME ON!
Philly to Chicago, Carolinas, COME ON!
Memphis to Nashville, Colorado, COME ON!
Detroit to Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, COME ON!
Seattle to Miami, Arizona, COME ON!
San Fran', Oakland, Hip-Hop, COME ON!

[KRS-One]
Down to the spot this is real Hip-Hop
Join this movement; them other cats steal a lot
You can feel the knowledge of self or feel this Glock
I'm authentic, KRS I'm really hot
Yo, what up Fat Joe that's my nigga for life
Remember when Pun fell off the stage, right on my wife
In the Bronx, we all laugh about it today
What up Freddie Fox, 2 Glocks, Pik and Spay
Dr.Dre all day, both of them
Dr.Dre with Ed Lover and the one with Eminem
This a movement, all over the world we reach
I can prove it, all over the world I teach
You hear that Dr.King, "I Have A Dream" speech a lot
But no where is it manifested but in Hip-Hop
While them other cats be lookin' for a radio song
I'm in Washington Heights, puttin' them Dominicans on
You can feel it I'm strong, I last longer lets do it
You want the real Hip-Hop well join this movement
We ain't about sellin' records, we ain't music merchants
We emcees we go to the club and straight hurt shit

[Hook]
Utah, Minnesota, Mexico, COME ON!
V.A., Arkansas, Portland, COME ON!
Indiana, Oklahoma, Kansas, COME ON!
East St.Louis, Milwaukee man, COME ON!
Montreal, Toronto, Canada, COME ON!
East Coast, West Coast, Dirty South, COME ON!
Mid-West, Bible Belt, Up-Top, COME ON!
Hip-Hop, COME ON!
Hip-Hop, COME ON!

[Verse One: KRS-One]
Yo turn me up just a bit, so I can hear it and spit
Reverse spit, and get tips, rehearse a hit and take tricks
Research the art just a bit, don't let me start I won't quit
But if I start I'mma flip, just like I'm startin the whip
Puttin the key into it, mentally seein it
G.O.D. believin in it, I get a fee when I spit
C-L-U-B's I just rip, I'm lyrically well equipped
Over the beats and the mix, I keep the streets in a fit
When it comes to lyrical spit, I'm the t'cha of it
Higher consciousness, truth, I'll be reachin for it
Metaphysics, here's an example cause I'm speakin of it
Put your hands in the air, but you must be aware
That even if your hands are down, ain't they still in the air?
I be takin you all the way down the road, takin you there
I'm livin and givin just a smidgen of what I share
The style that I'm kickin, lyric lickings from over there
We rockin forever, we get better with every year
With letters and intercessors I sever every fear
Lookin here, like UPS KRS takes it there
Let's make it clear, thought waves go through the air
You can act like you busy or you dizzy or you don't care
But listen here, everybody got a fear
An insecurity, some type of thing they gotta clear
So that's when I, reappear, from the rear
Philsopher, follow the bright light to right here
I might wear, light gear
Appear when you least expect it, tellin you now how to fight fear
With faith, you hear the bass, well clear the waste
You gotta get the negative cats out your face
Get that irrelevant crap out your space
Conceive it believe it decree it achieve it with HASTE!

[Hook]
Nuttin in the world is impossible
Listen to the shit that I drop on you
KRS-One, philosophical
Believe and achieve what you got to do

[Verse Two: KRS-One]
We rawwwwwwwwwk, we don't stop
Hip-Hooooooooop, we don't stop
Tick-tooooooock, we don't stop
We at the top we never drop cause true hip-hop is so hot
Some people thuggin, some be pimpin, I be teachin a lot
I be teachin about the meaning of a deeper hip-hop
That don't make me any better than a thief or a cop
All I know is when I flow, the people be shocked
You don't really want the teacher to come step on your block
With my whole Glock takin everything that you've got
I'm a different type of deeper intellectual rock
For when you really wanna compete and get up off your block
You are not just doin hip-hop, you ARE hip-hop
Like if you have a badge and a gun, you ARE the cop
Like if you practice medicine, you ARE the doc
You just forgot rappers rap about cars a lot
And the magazines worry about stars a lot
But I'm the sun and they avoid me BECAUSE I'm hot
The orthodox hip-hop is sure to rock
With or without a video, I'm leavin 'em all in shock, OHH!

[Hook] - repeat 4X

[Intro]
Oh, do it now, oh, do it now
Yeah, we celebrate diversity in the university
Everybody can't be a queen, everybody can't be a ho and a bitch (Ha ha)
Everybody can't b e a philosopher
Some of y'all gotta load up the clip
Word up, watch this

[Hook]
It goes 1, 2, 3 we the best
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, as you can see, or KRS
You don't wanna test the team, why get a vest
You don't wanna be cursed in a verse, by the blessed
KRS with the sound for the east and the west
Follow no, follow no, follow no, follow no beast on a quest

[Verse]
Somebody gotta be fresh
Somebody gotta be whack
Somebody gotta be the emcee
Somebody gotta do the rap
Somebody gotta be smart
Somebody gotta do that
Somebody gotta do art
Somebody gotta be black
Somebody gotta have heart
Somebody gotta be white
Somebody gotta do their part
Somebody gotta be bright
Somebody gotta be up
Somebody gotta be down
Somebody gotta be the teacher
Somebody gotta be the clown
Somebody gotta be lost
Somebody gotta be found
Somebody gotta be in the economy making the money go round
Somebody gotta be the president
Somebody gotta get down
Somebody gotta be hesitant
Somebody gotta be relevant
Somebody gotta be celibate
Somebody gotta be having their sex in a lex for the hell of it
Somebody gotta be intelligent
Somebody gotta be illiterate
Somebody gotta go all the way
Somebody gotta go a little bit
Somebody got to be an idiot
Somebody gotta be belligerent
Somebody gotta be hip hop
Cause somebody else is living it
Somebody gotta be spitting it
Somebody gotta be ignorant
Somebody gotta be holy
But somebody gotta have sin in it
Somebody gotta be losing it
Somebody gotta be winning it
Somebody gotta be flippin' the style I'm kicking just a little bit
Somebody gotta be into it
Somebody gotta be out of it
Somebody gotta be up for it
Somebody gotta be doubtin' it
Somebody gotta be running it
Somebody gotta be all that
Somebody don't even know that
Somebody gotta come right here
Somebody else gotta go back
Somebody gotta be scheming
Somebody gotta be a witness
Somebody gotta be seeing in the meaning is different
Somebody else gotta be somebody, for some else to be somebody
Somebody else to run into to wealth, to try to create one body
One aim, one God, one destiny
I'm not non-violent, you can back up off of me
I sip my tea, and cock back three
One for Tiny Tim, Mr. Walt, and Evil Dee
I hope you all see, the need for unity
I'll never stop speaking about Marcus Garvey
Kwame Ture or Malcolm X all day
Black leadership today is all play
Y'all play, y'all immature black behavior
Is worse than being a traitor
Do on to others, as you would have done do to your neighbor
Big up to my philosophy majors
Free Mumia Abu-Jamal from the cages
We writes the pages and teach all ages
Justice, tell me what we want now
Justice, for Mumia Abu-Jamal
Or justice for Amadou Diallo
Justice, there is no peace without (*Justice*)
All dem mercy, now watch this

[Hook]

Follow no beast, on a quest
Do you hear me?
Follow no beast, on a quest
Word
Hip Hop ya don't stop
Tiny Tim ya don't stop
KRS ya don't stop
Get by us

[KRS-One]
Uh-huh!  Y'all forgot about this shit right?  Haha
Haha, TURN THE RADIO OFF!!
Word!  Yeah, whattup Choco?  Haha
Yo turn it around for me one time
Uhh, uhh, yo

[Verse One]
I don't despise thugs, I +ADVISE+ thugs
I teach y'all thugs, cause that's what I was
Yeah I say was cause today I'm above
All the guns, illegal funds, the crews and the drugs
ANY HOOD I walk in, they show me love
They say 'Knowledge Reigns Supreme, WHATTUP CUZ?'
Cops wanna get sit down and get all bud
They wanna think as they drink drink down to the suds
I respect it, but I don't get down with the fuzz
I don't drink with DT's I don't hang with the judge
But truth be truth and I got the proof
Most ministers were straight thugged out in they youth
See if you're over 25 and you never got live
When it was time to ride, you ain't got no heart
But if you're over 26 and you're still in the mix
And your life you ain't fixed, you ain't doin your part
You see them cats on TV, playin the role?
Gassin y'all, them cats be over thirty years old!
Actin all dirty and cold
NONE OF MY CLASSIC ALBUMS they was worthy to hold
I'm concerned with the soul, overstand?
When we was slappin up rappers they was doin the running man
You don't know my style, we be straight gunnin man
If you don't know you better ask your older brother man
Shit gets realer than, Real TV
From eighty-six, ain't no rapper realer than me
Or Just-Ice, I.C.U. or Steady B
What y'all waitin to see?  Somethin faker than me?
Don't let me have to pull out the Jamaican in me
I'd rather pull out the as-salamu alaykum in me
Wa-alaikum salaam, yo you wan' tess de Don?
BLAOW BLAOW BLAOW-BLOAW-BLAOW, bwoy gone!

[Hook]
They don't really wanna learn - well start gunnin 'em down!
Yo they really ain't concerned - well start gunnin 'em down!
They don't wanna get the book - well start gunnin 'em down!
They don't want a conscious hook - well start gunnin 'em down!
They don't wanna pay dues - well start gunnin 'em down!
They be actin brand new - well start gunnin 'em down!
They don't wanna get the light - well start gunnin 'em down!
Yo, pass me the mic - we'll start gunnin 'em down!

[Verse Two]
Watch dis!  Your crew is my crew and my crew is my crew
Your crew you lied to, my crew will find you
The light I recite will blind and outshine you
Street cats be wonderin why they even signed you
Where they find you?  WHO is the first cat to rap
"wa-da-da-ding" and show you what the nine do?
You ain't never seen me behave with them firearms
Maybe not, cause you just a slave to Viacom
Me, I'm a free MC hip-hopper
I teach real gangsters, hang with real Godsters
I am to hip-hop what Selassie is to rastas
Watch your mouth before someone I don't know pops ya
Lemme stop, don't-a-stop the street rhetorhic, ha
Your soul you sellin it ha, come wit some better shit, ha
In five years your whole catalogue's irrelevant ha
You spit the ignorance while I spit intelligence
You got it backwards like sayin hop-hip
That's why when you battled your whole crew got ripped!
{*needle drags across record*} You wanna battle?

[Hook]

[KRS-One] Yeah, all my fathers

[Tekitha] That survive, gotta ride to break the illusion, confusion

[KRS-One] Uh.. uh, word

[Tekitha] Keep on fightin, strivin

[KRS-One] Uh.. hold your head up!

[Tekitha] Survivin, survivin

[Tekitha] That survive, gotta ride to break the illusion, confusion

[Tekitha] Keep on fightin, strivin, survivin, survivin

[Verse One: uncredited - possibly Shuman]
Yo, time to do what we gotta do
These days, livin ain't true, but I ain't mad at you
I don't got time for the stress and the nonsense
So I try to stay blessed, but it's all tense
When I awake, feel the sun on my right side
It make me wanna grab a gun and change my lifestyle
But it only goes so far, so live it up
Or realize what you know star, and give it up
Or either switch it up, gotta keep reppin on
And lookin out for our kids, like the rest of em'
Now I know how it is, and what you're handin me
So I can calculate the right moves for my family, yo

[Tekitha] That survive, gotta ride to break the illusion, confusion

[KRS-One] Keep on!

[Tekitha] Keep on fightin, strivin

[KRS-One] C'mon, c'mon!

[Tekitha] Survivin, survivin

[KRS-One] C'mon, that's right

[Tekitha] That survive, gotta ride to break the illusion, confusion

[Tekitha] Keep on fightin, strivin

[KRS-One] Word up!

[Tekitha] Survivin, survivin

[Verse Two: KRS-One]
C'mon, let's do this
When it comes to the cash, we ain't equal
Rich man, poor man, poverty defeats you
Where my people? Yo, Kris see you
There's only one of you, that's why you gotta be you
Them others be see-through, flashin and flossin
Me I'm with Inebriated Beats in Boston
Strivin, survivin, we get cash often
But do you really know what daycare be costin?
All my fathers, all my mothers
All my sisters, all my brothers
Hold your head up and teach them younger cats
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at!

[Tekitha] That survive, gotta ride to break the illusion, confusion

[Tekitha] Keep on fightin, strivin, survivin, survivin

[Tekitha] That survive, gotta ride to break the illusion, confusion

[Tekitha] Keep on fightin, strivin, survivin, survivin

[Verse Three: uncredited - possibly Priest]
Now see I'm livin just to die without most any reason
So I keep on chasin paper 'til it's time to go
But should I really go for mine and put the clip all in the 9
Or stay at the 9 to 5 a day I just don't know
But a brother got a daughter I gotta support her
Caught up in a system that's outta order, man I can't afford
A kitted Escalade, or bling bling
And so I gotta keep survivin, is the song that I keep singin
I try to keep my head off the floor, the country's goin to war
While Bush is givin dough to NASA and ain't feedin the poor

We keep it tight.. we keep it right..
We're comin strong.. we're movin on.. (yeah)
It's time to rise.. and unify..
Keep comin strong (uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh!)
Just keep movin on..

[KRS-One]
Yo, where's my people at?
We be where the elite be at
We really never need the gat, we comin with a sneak attack
In fact, best believe we back
What we rap it heats the track
Kenny Parker sees to that, my job is to teach these cats
Present the clear speech they lack
And show 'em how to eat from rap

[April S. Williams]
We keep it tight.. we keep it right.. (that's right)
We're comin strong.. (uh-huh, yeah) we're movin on.. (tell 'em again!)
(Uhh) It's time to rise.. and unify.. (yeah, yeah)
Keep comin strong (uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh!)
Just keep movin on..

[KRS-One]
You know why the devil can't get with me?
Cause he's a liar, I've got victory
You can stick with me, my click is free
Negativity, that doesn't live with me
These rappers on one, I've skipped to three
These rappers on A, I've skipped to C
My image, heads ain't quick to be
So I thank you for pickin me
I know why people got to know, these wack rappers got to go
Let a MC rock the show
I'll show 'em how it 'posed to go
We forgot simply what we supposed to know
We still must defeat the foe
So what you got the dough? Your words don't make us glow
In fact they make us slow
How long this gonna take to know you ain't gotta be a ho?

[April S. Williams]
We keep it tight.. we keep it right.. (yeah)
We're comin strong.. (yeah, yeah) we're movin on.. (uh-huh)
(Tell them again!) It's time to rise.. and unify.. (yeah)
Keep comin strong (uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh!)
Just keep movin on..

[KRS-One]
Look at the teacher, I stay attuned
People are blessed when I walk in the room
Snakes(?) don't stop me, and if they did
They'd be askin for a tag 'fore they kids
Medical students lose it when I enter any hospital
Doctors wanna talk music and whatever's topical
It's all logical, I perform the impossible
Through words I put hip-hop in you; listen
Here's what we got to do, unify
Defeat the flesh, defeat the beast in you and I
Win or lose I never shout, believe in yourself and never doubt
Discipline is simply a better route

[April S. Williams]
We keep it tight - we keep it tight
We keep it right - we keep it right
We're comin strong - comin strong
We're movin on - movin on!
It's time to rise - it's time to rise
And unify - unifyyyy
Keep comin strong - comin strong
Just keep movin on - keep on movin on
We keep it tight - we keep it tight
We keep it right - we keep it right
We're comin strong - we're comin strong
We're movin on - movin on!
It's time to rise - it's time to rise
And unify - it's time to unify
Keep comin strong
Just keep movin on - keep on movin on
..
Just keep movin on - keep on movin on
Just keep movin on - we gotta keep on movin on
Just keep movin on - wake up and realize
Just keep movin on - that you just keep movin on
Just keep movin on - it's time to realize
Just keep movin on - that you gotta keep movin on
Just keep movin on - keep movin on, keep movin on
Just keep movin on - you gotta keep movin on, you gotta take that time
Just keep movin on - you gotta realize, that it's time
- keep on movin on, keep on movin on

[Hook]
What does it mean to be underground?
It means you gotta be free to be underground
Yo, you got your own key when you're underground
If you're listening to me yo you underground

[Verse One]
It's time that I open with a thunder sound
Now look around your own town for the underground
Yo, you rhymin for the TV, or a million CD's?
You ain't a MC, you ain't underground
You could be platinum or gold, hot or cold
But it's the respect you hold that's underground
When the critics don't get, that for the streets you spit it
When your lyric they fear, that's underground

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Yo, white kids, black kids, skinny kids, fat kids
Them Asian cats be underground
Chicanos, Palestinians, Milanos, fuck the Lone Ranger
Where's Tonto? That's underground
Freddie Foxxx, Blackalicious, Kweli
M.O.P., GangStarr that's underground
Mad Lion, Smif-N-Wessun, Buckshot
Armageddeon T.S. that's underground, UHH!

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Yo, the t'cha returns, I told y'all I went to Cali to learn
And that shit was underground
If the cops be eyein you, cause survive is what you try to do
Yo I'm wit you, you underground
If it's justice you want, and you protest the ice they flaunt
You want skills that's UNDERGROUND
Yo it's not about a rugged rapper, or an actor
It's about your subject matter, that's underground
LOOK!

[Hook]

[Verse Four]
Chevonne Dean from Ruff Ryders, all the Outsidaz
Young Zee, that's underground
When all your money's spent, and you're still hangin on
To 50 Cent (get it) you underground
When you rep the collective consciousness of hip-hop
Not hip-pop, you underground
Yo it ain't about jewels, bitches and cars
It's about Nas, that's underground, yo!

[Hook]

[Verse Five]
To be underground simply means that you're down
For the struggle, get 'em up, that's underground
You could be a classy lady or a whore
But if you protest the war, for sure, you UNDERGROUND
If the government can't see you, or deceive you
You love your people, believe you underground
If you refuse to play the game, you go against the grain
You ridin the train, you underground - get it!

[Hook]

[Verse Six]
Yo, yo, that blast from the past, like Grandmaster Caz
Bam and Flash, that's underground
Doug E. Fresh, Lord Finesse, KRS
If you listenin to this you underground
Turn it up now KRS about to show you how
They go wow, BLAOW for the underground
Mr. Walt, Evil Dee, KRS, BDP
Kenny P, that's underground - do it!

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
(Alright!) Turn it up ah, turn it up ah
Turn it up ah, turn it up ah
Turn it up ah, turn it up ah
Turn it up if you underground - Listen!

[KRS-One]
Okay now, listen to this..
{*sound effect: seagulls*}
A mystical teacher sat by the seaside
It was about five o'clock cause we heard the free ride
Anyway; the teacher was talking in stride
Sitting upon a rock that was wide
And warning against false pride
"Come to where I reside!" a woman cried
And the teacher replied, "Do you serve your fish fried?"
"Yes," she replied, "with potato salad on the side."
And the teacher replied, "Well where do you reside?"
She said, "Up on the hillside, it's not a far ride
If you came to have dinner, I would be so gratified."
The teacher replied, "It's six o'clock, seven o'clock, you decide."
She replied, "Seven o'clock, do you like stir-fried?"
She was mystified and felt so dignified
The teacher was coming to the house where she resides
So she purified with pesticides
{*sound effect: chemicals sprayed*}
Called her friends up nationwide
{*sound effect: phone being dialed*}
Some of her friends were tongue-tied they felt so glorified
She made steamed fish, baked fish, fish that was fried
Soup, steamed vegetables, potato salad on the side
{*sound effect: food cooking*}
You could smell the bread in the oven far and wide
Natural juices and water purified
Organic fruits brought from the countryside
With silver forks and knives placed side by side
{*sound effect: silverware clinks*}
You could not be dissatisfied;
Looking out the window staring at the mountainside
You would have died
6:59 she's swollen with pride
As the moment intensified, there's a knock from outside
{*sound effect: door knocking*}
She opens the door, for the teacher has arrived
{*sound effect: door creaks open*}
But to her surprise, it was a bum who cried
"Please, I smelt the bread from outside!
One piece," and then she replied
"The teacher is coming, he's soon to have arrived
You're making me look bad, come on now, step aside!"
The bum then replied
"When I say I'm hungry I haven't lied
Give me some of that chicken that you just fried."
{*sound effect: food cooking*}
She replied, "Chicken - fried?
No that's for the teacher, you're not purified"
Then she slammed the door and went back inside
{*sound effect: door closes*}
Sat on the couch with the TV Guide
She looked at the clock, it was 7:09, then 7:30;
He still hasn't arrived
Eight o'clock, she's on the downside
Nine o'clock, by now she's teary-eyed
She's pissed off and her anger multiplied
She cried, then fell asleep dissatisfied
Next day she woke up, and was preoccupied
With meeting the mystical teacher who lied
Where could he hide?
She ran down by the seaside
{*sound effect: seagulls*}
He was there teaching about - false pride
"You lied!" she replied, "You lied!
You said you'd be there at seven o'clock, you lied!"
He replied, "No I have not lied
I came at 6:59, and you told me to move aside
I asked for bread and the chicken that was fried
{*sound effect: food cooking*}
And you said, that I wasn't purified."
She replied, "I wasn't notified!
I had no idea that you was the bum that cried!"
And the teacher sighed, then replied
"This concludes our lesson on false pride."
"Why do you listen to KRS-One?"
"Cause it's more than just music
He speaks to my way of life."
"KRS is the best.  Listen for the inner meanings."
"Never heard, anyone like this."

[KRS-One]
Feel this!  Feel it!
Feel the power, of DJ Kenny Parker, word up.. huh!

C'mon, yeah.. uhh.. {"Yeah yeah yeah"}
So we gonna come down one time for your mind, you know whassup
Turn it up, turn it up turn it up turn it up
Look!!

We spit out hits, ghetto chicks, chromed out whips
Philosophers rockin your corner movie scripts
Ghetto lifestyles, keep watchin..
{"Protect yourself"} - that's right!
We spit out hits, ghetto chicks, chromed out whips
Philosophers rockin your corner movie scripts
Ghetto lifestyles, keep watchin..
{"Protect yourself"}
Yo, all summer they bump the KRS-Oner
From the microscopic atomic structure of the under
I spit thunder, which hunts ya, runs you down and stuns ya
I'm at the center of all rap worlds like a rotunda
Then again, I rock you and your friend again
In any club in the country when you say KRS they say, "Let him in"
V.I.P. passes for intellectuals with glasses
Ignorant asses get left outside with the masses
Next day we attend classes and gatherings
Shattering, those that be rattling about battling
Battin 'em down from the Bronx like Don Mattingly(?)
The black African snappin backs again and laughin again
You won't be askin again, my album I'm already masterin
Whoever you think is dope I'm already blastin him

We spit out hits, ghetto chicks, chromed out whips
Philosophers rockin your corner movie scripts
Ghetto lifestyles, keep watchin..
{"Protect yourself"} - that's right!
We spit out hits, ghetto chicks, chromed out whips
Philosophers rockin your corner movie scripts
Ghetto lifestyles, keep watchin..
Yeah
Who will be standing when the smoke clears?

[(KRS-One) --] Redman](1831239)

Word up!
What's up with this?
We're coming through
Boogie Down style, kid
What's up
This is KRS-One
The light at the end of the tunnel

Yo, they not HOT, all they do is talk a lot
That's not HOT, where's your respect on the block?
That's HOT, not cause you're friends with the cops
That's not HOT, a real MC you're not

I'm HOT, been hot, repeatedly heated
Don't call the teacher, hah, you best be seated
You got these kids gased up like you own the inventory
Fake muthafuckas ain't tellin the whole story
Tell em how you borrow from everyone you knew
And now that you're on top, they can't borrow from you
That's not hot, tell em how you love bein pop
Cause you was so broke before, sleepin cold on a cot
You don't rock, you grab money
Your crocks rock the spot and you grab them honeys
It's about to get ugly
I don't even go to these bullshit kiddie-ass clubs
You wanna be a thug? Let's thug
First of all, soldiers speak to soldiers
Captains speak to captains
Lieutenant/lieutenant, cool?
But your first mistake is: he's steppin to me, rookie
Like you a O.G. and you just a run-up, fool
Who really got these streets on lock?
Whose name really holds high respect on the block?
Who opened up these clubs and taught you how to mix?
Who opened up these thugs from Compton to the Bricks?
I don't even sound like the rest of you kiddies
I study the ways of God, you studyin titties
And ass, I pity your class
Cause you come out with a blast
But you're trash, so you really don't last
They not HOT, all they do is talk a lot
That's not HOT, where's your respect on the block?
That's HOT, not cause you're friends with the cops
That's not HOT, a real MC you're not
They not HOT, all they do is talk a lot
That's not HOT, where's your respect on the block?
That's HOT, not cause you're friends with the cops
That's not HOT, a real MC you're not
This is hotter than heat, too deep, I'm on top of the streets
You weak, you ain't really rockin these beats
You ?????, you dress straight, eat straight
But you're a slave, and yo, you can't come up in a heat tank
G-o-d we thank, we watch what we sell
You better hope these Christians are wrong cause you goin to hell
Think about that when you're spittin your raps
And you call out KRS, I'll put you flat on your back
You're not HOT, all you do is talk a lot
That's not HOT, where's your respect on the block?
That's HOT, not cause you're friends with the cops
That's not HOT, a real MC you're not
What's HOT?
(KRS-One)
That's HOT!
What's HOT?
(KRS-One)
That's HOT!
Who's HOT?
(KRS-One)
That's HOT!
Where's your respect on the block?

[Hook: KRS] + (guest)
It's all a struggle (tryin to make it day to day)
It's all a struggle (from my hood to around your way)
It's all a struggle (single parents all by theyself)
It's all a struggle (diseases decreasin your health)
It's all a struggle (fiends swearin that's they last puff)
It's all a struggle (hustler tryin to avoid handcuffs)
(No matter what you do, who you are or where you from)
(Rich poor black white, at the end of the day)

[Verse One: KRS-One]
It's all a struggle - and most people's struggles are doubled
You ain't the only one with a challenge facing some trouble
Look at the woman chewed up by the dog with no muzzle
Or the workers that got trapped underground in that tunnel
Some kids are playing in pools, others in puddles
When they listen to the news the propoganda is subtle
But it's time for you to know that the cryin got to go
Release the guilt that you built and let it flow
Slow and low, that is the tempo
Move slow and on the low, this you gotta know
You don't get the muscles without the hard struggles
You ain't the only one out here tryin to get dough
From the hustler to the preacher to the government leaders
From the airline pilot to the chef to the teachers
We linked in the same huddle, in the same tussle'n'bustle
Cause at the end of the day, it's all a struggle

[Hook]

[Verse Two: KRS-One]
It's all a struggle - but don't let the challenges bug you
Or the government drug you, or the thieves in the street
Beat and mug you - build your tunnel under the rubble
Come up on the other side eye to eye with the trouble
Look at the Twin Towers crumble
Look at the religious leadership stumble, everybody struggles
But not everybody comes through nifty, it's fifty/fifty
The city itself will outrun you quickly
Whether you be healthy or sickly
Whether you be wealthy or thrifty, ugly or pretty
Everybody's tryin to get 50's and 100's
I taught this at UCLA just off Sunset
Now run get "Ruminations"
It's a book that I published for the healing of this nation
In just a few chapters we run through, some possible solutions
Cause at the end of the day

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
It's all a struggle
Yeah
(Yeah)
Yeah
(Yeah)
Ah-ha
(Ah-ha)
Ah-ha
(Ah-ha)
Hardcore!
Word
Hardcore!

[*live excerpt*]
(You really think they're ready, black?)

Let's break it all the way down
All the way down

Huh-huh
Don't be fooled...
Don't be fooled...
Rap is something you do
Hip-hop is something you live
Rap is something you do
Hip-hop is something you.. ( *crowd responds "live!" )
Rap is something you do
Hip-hop.. ( *crowd responds "is something you live!" )
You are not just doing hip-hop..
( *crowd responds "You are hip hop!" )
Yeah
Let's get this started
Word up

[Chorus]
You gotta - get - your - self - up
You been knocked down?
Get yourself up
You been shot down?
Get yourself up
You been locked down?
Get yourself up
Get - your - self - up
Been knocked down?
Get yourself up
Been shot down?
Get yourself up
You been locked down?
Get yourself up

What is a real hip-hop MC?
Is it MTV?
Is it BET?
Is it five M-I-C's so the people can see?
I mean, how you think you're free when you act like property?
Tell me, how do you judge an MC when he's rockin'?
I mean, rockin' it live, not pickin his cotton?
I mean, adjusting his clothes? I mean, how do you know
Before you come to the show that you're not gettin heated?
That you're not gettin cheated?
That you ain't come to the club thinkin', 'I must've been weeded'?
(Word)
You got to be a educated consumer
Spend your money on MC's 'cause these rappers'll do ya
All they want is your cash, ass, grass, gas and a flick
When you ask for that autograph they ass-dash quick
Beware of the rapper, he talks like it don't matter
He pulls his gat while we bust off the gat-ler

[Chorus]

This is "The Sneak Attack"
The "Edutainment" style returns like that
Take it off your shelf
'Cause all we deal wit is knowledge of self, health and wealth
Not Stealth bombers, leather goose bombers
Original hip-hop armor on cd-rom - uh
You got to get with a
21st century philosopher
Representin' the religion of hip-hop sir
Those that oppose are foes and will get rocked - uh
Stop, uh
I rise like a helicopter
Like Zulu I'll Shaka, crowd
With a beat that's loud
Huh, I'm black and I'm proud, irrelevant
I'm black and intelligent
I teach my kids to watch the education they give 'em
'Cause it's really all about street wisdom

[Chorus]

True hip-hoppers don't bleed
True hip-hoppers don't need
True hip-hoppers don't speed
No time for greed
True hip-hoppers do read and will lead
Not plead
Will sow seeds that breed
Ah-ha that's safer than weed, indeed
True hip-hoppers don't slave
True hip-hoppers don't crave
Silver and gold, we're not amazed
We live F-R-E-E
If you not into lyrics you can't really hear it nor see me
My philosophy keeps it plain and simple
Here it is: the kingdom of hip-hop is within you
Or is it the kingdom of hell that sends you?
I'm ringin a bell within you
You only seekin to sell
That's what sin do
It tells you to put your craft on a menu, a chart
So they can sell you and your art

[Chorus]
Yeah, whassup?

Whassamatta you? (You) Why you lookin so sad (so sad)
KRS is back (he's back!) But you don't look so glad
Ahh shutupayouface!

Look at this place!
Why was I chosen to pick up the race?
And carry the flame, the torch, the name?
Millenium games, it's all the same
Sinners repent, many for fear
End of the year, everyone cheers
Only a few hear my voice in they ears
Everyone else well they really don't care
But what if I told you I could read the future
And in the future, they the losers
We the winners, cause they the sinners
Well it's all mathematics, can I eat my dinner
And think (think) why was I made to link
Between them and the universe; battle, who the first?
I don't really care, cause I'm really not here
I'm showin you skill, but you still sayin "Where?"
Whassamatta you? (You) Why you lookin so sad (so sad)
KRS is back (he's back!) But you don't look so glad
Ahh shutupayouface!

Every race, walkin around with they head up in space
They cannot see that we all really one
In any battle I already won
Thank the creator, it's already done
KRS-One? Leavin 'em stunned
Dunn duh-duh dunn dunn done it again
Me and Will and my brother named Ken, now let me tell you
The bass in your face, the highs in your eyes
Will make you real-IZE
If you down with the Temple of Hip-Hop, you not no average GUY, or girl
C'mon take a critical look in my world
See the metaphysical books that I twirl and twist
Forces the ventriloquist
I'm just a dummy gettin money at this name Kris

Whassamatta you? (You) Why you lookin so sad (so sad)
KRS is back (he's back!) But you don't look so glad
Ahh shutupayouface!

KRS-One, Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone
Look, I be chillin readin a book
While the hip-hop nation repeats my hooks
All I wanna see is y'all healthy and wealthy
Yeah we already did it, really what can they tell me
About the pimps and the hoes, players and the clothes
You gets no money if you got no flow, no skill
C'mon y'all it's time to build
If you got no skill, how you gon' build?
Build, c'mon y'all it's time to build
If you got no skill, how you gon' build?
Whassamatta you? (You) Why you lookin so sad (so sad)
KRS is back (he's back!) But you don't look so glad
Ahh shutupayouface!

Negative ass..
We bring the light!

North Carolina - they got me
Florida - they got me
Texas - yeah they rock me
In New York City they got me
L.A. - ha hah, they got me
Canada - Up North they rock me
D.C. - Atlanta, they got me
Ha hah - none of y'all can't stop me

Whassamatta you? (You) Why you lookin so sad (so sad)
KRS is back (he's back!) But you don't look so glad
Ahh shutupayouface!.

Give it to 'em..
* H.W.C. harmonizes a melody (no words) where this appears

So gather round now for the raptism
Cause if the dogs don't get 'em
The cat'll get 'em, or the gat'll get 'em, or the crack'll get 'em
Time for spiritual activism, life is a journey
And Kris got the map with him
Teach latinos and blacks with 'em
It's amazing when whites and asians kick raps with 'em
Cause out of a thousand MC's, believe I taught half of 'em
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, I beam through many images
My origin is a mystery like capstones on pyramids
We live it kid, challenge the teacher you will regret that
I'm giving careers and taking careers away, did you forget that?
Better check that, you can rock this track and the next track
But when I correct the spirit hit, you'll always be set back
So gather round now for the raptism
Only those that got hip-hop in 'em
And not rap in 'em and no crack with 'em
Step up now and receive a holy dose
From a holy host, and take a break from these rappers that only boast
{HWC} Wake up, to make up

[KRS] Yeah yeah, yeah
{HWC} Wake up, to make up

[KRS] Huh, huh, yeah yeah, yeah
{HWC} Wake up, to make up

[KRS] Yo, yeah, yo..
My intellectual battle will make your brains rattle
I'll unwrap you and your crew from the same shackle
I'm on many different planes like a airport
Psychologically you be rethinkin your identity and cuttin ya hair short
Now there's a thought, that exposes your insecurity
You put no fear in me, I break the M from the C
And reverse it to say "See 'em? See 'em?"
They allow the devil to lead 'em, and they be givin up they freedom
So, huh, gather round for the raptism
{HWC} Wake up
When the spirit hear it the lyric long before the track get 'em
{HWC} Wake up
I spit 'em out, gotta get 'em out, the world I never been about
I see them glitter but their spirit's goin in and out
We see them fading, we also see them hating
We also see those living for musical chart ratings
Hear what I'm stating or trading for what you're paying
Replace fear with faith and you'll stop decaying
Gather round for the raptism (word)
Gather round for the raptism (word, word)
{HWC} Wake up, wake up, wake up
* Gather round for the raptism
{HWC} Make up, make up, make up
* Cause if the dogs don't get 'em
The cat'll get 'em, or the gat'll get 'em, or the crack'll get 'em
Yo, yo, gather round for the raptism
{HWC} Wake up
Word.. word..
{HWC} Wake up
Word..
{HWC} Wake up
The dogs don't get 'em
The cat'll get 'em, or the crack'll get 'em, or the gat'll get 'em
{HWC} Wake up
{HWC} Everyday, when you wake up
{HWC} You got a chance, to MAKE UP!
Remember, you are not just doing hip-hop, you ARE hip-hop
{HWC} Wake up to make up
{HWC} Wake up to make up
Twice a year, hip-hoppers come together
To celebrate the unity of hip-hop
We come together, during Hip-Hop Appreciation Week
{HWC} Wake up to make up..
Which is every third week in May
{HWC} Wake up to make up..
Then, we come together in Novemeber
To celebrate Hip-Hop History Month
I will see you there - PEACE!

Thou knowest not what thou sayeth in speech?
Doth thou know what thou teacheth to each?
From thine own mouth, thy corrupt thine own house
Thy corrupt thine siblings and thine own spouse
Satan has hold of thy spirit
So evil has hold of thy lyric
Whomsoever shall hear it shall adapt it
And walk the talk of evil just as ye rapped it
But I cometh forth today to say thus
Evil is an illusion, in GOD we trust
In Satan we lust
Coveting thy brother's vehicle while riding the bus
Feeling unjust
Trust not sinners in the flesh they aren't winners
But in the spirit they art children, beginners
Eat not of the dinner they serve
Seek the experienced MC, not the beginners in word
There's no such thing as a government
There's only people rulin over people
People jerkin around people
People lendin a hand to people..
What part of the system do you play?
Who do you oppress? .. Uhh!

[Hook]
What kinda world are we livin in?  Yo
What kinda world are we livin innnnnn?
Can I get with my people?  Can I sit with my people?
Break bread with my people?  Move ahead with my people?

[Hook] - 1/2

[KRS-One]
When every day, seven thousand kids are gettin locked up
When every day the justice system seems to stay stocked up
When every day they cuttin 'em down 'fore they even pop up
When every day you gotta duck 'fore you get shot up
What kinda world are we livin in, spinnin in
Winnin in, sinnin in, let us begin again
Churches are ran like corporations makin me holla
Corporations are ran like churches praisin the dollar
There's no way out, or is it?  Release your doubt and live it
Teachin metaphysics don't listen to these critics hear it
What kinda world are we livin in?
Believe in yourself, achieve for yourself, see for yourself
Speak for yourself, never weaken yourself, by deceivin yourself
Believe in your wealth, c'mon!

[Hook]

[KRS-One]
Yo, yo, yeah
What kinda world are we livin out, we move about
In fear and doubt, tryin to get more clout
Just check it check it out, we took the wrong route
To a morality drought, basically I'm callin 'em out
What kinda world are we livin in, when a song
Will not get on, unless it talks 'bout thongs
Now where did we go wrong?  We don't have long
Preference all torn all worn not norm and all gone
What kinda world do we live around, when we lay around
Let me break it down, they shuttin us down
While we play around, we fallin, stallin
While God's callin, all in to fall in

[Hook]

[Hook] - 1/2

[KRS-One]
When every day another unwanted pregnancy ends
When every day another person is betrayed by a friend
When every day it never ends, and the people pretend
Like the President is there cause of them, let me ask
What kinda world can we really trust
When the cops they can shoot at us?  Bo bo!
What kinda world can we really grow (ohh)
When our daughters wanna be hoes (ohh)
And a father that nobody knows (ohh)
And a mother wearin them sexy clothes (ho)
What kinda world are we livin in, yo
What kinda world are we livin in, uhh

[Hook] w/ variations

[KRS]
Can I get with my people?  Can I sit with my people?
Break bread with my people?  Move ahead with my people?
Can I sit with my people?  Can I get with my people?
Break bread with my people?  Move ahead with my people?
Can I sit with my people?  Can I get with my people?
Break bread with my people?  Move ahead with my people?

Fresh.. for two-thousand-one.. you SU-CKAZZZZZZ!

[KRS-One] Class in session. What, is, democracy?

[student] Yo it's the rule of the people.  The self rule

[student] It's what the people want!

[K] That's right. But is this a democracy?

[s] Nah, democracy is a goal to be attained

[K] That's right. The character of the people should be reflected

[K] in the laws and the institution of the state

[s] Psssh, I don't see my character reflected!

[K] Tell me

[Hook One: KRS-One]
WHY, are all the schools they fallin apart
And WHY, the youth not takin no musical art
And WHY, the professionals really don't know where to start
No, one, really, cares, about
WHY, the people ain't trustin the law and the order
And WHY, the hookers from 70's look like our daughters
And WHY, the radio station they help with the slaughter
No, one, really, cares, about

[KRS-One]
The mind, they usin until it's time they doin a rhyme
Will ruin what you doin if you crime pursuin
Let me tell you bout gettin your family out the mean ghetto
To green meadows, where you can finally be settled
That street level, freak level, pullin out heat level
Eatin meat level, deceit level, that's that beast level
You gotta stand upright in a house with three levels
Where you don't even see devils unless he shovels the snow
Many philosophers live on the low
Never crazy hazy or lazy we get up and go
Whaddya know, I'm always teaching after the show
Not messin with hoes, I'm with my wife, changin my clothes
Blowin my nose, deliverin blows to foes
With new flows; then disappear where nobody knows
Cause I got too many questions, too many lessons
I gotta go, too many people stressin but I gotta know

[Hook Two: KRS-One]
WHY, these officers gunnin us down on our block
And WHY, the President never steps in on these cops
And WHY, the mayor don't even look like he in shock
No, one, really, cares, about
WHY, the call of the poor is always ignored
And WHY, the senators governors breakin the law
And WHY, they taxin and taxin and taxin the poor
No, one, really, cares, about

[KRS-One]
You, me, or themselves you can tell, they livin in hell
But they come on the TV lookin so swell
Sellin you dreams of schemes of you gettin green and cream
But they never explain the work and all it means
You got to visualize, close the lid on your eyes
And visualize, minimize lies
See yourself bigger in size, quicker to rise up
Wise up climb up, before your time's up but

[Hook One]

[s] The votes

[K] That's right

[s] The politics

[K] That's right

[s] The government you know!

[K] Uh-huh, people basically have the government they want

[s] If people felt dissed, they'd be out rebellin right now

[KRS-One]
Instead of reading the word of Christ, BE the word of Christ
Instead of following God's word, BE God's word
That's the conciousness of hip-hop
You are not just doing hip-hop, you ARE hip-hop
You are not just reading the word of God, you ARE the word of God

[KRS] I will make it

[HWC] I will make it!

[KRS] They can fake it

[HWC] (??)

[KRS] Time that I state it

[HWC] I can create it

[KRS] I create it

[HWC] No one can make it

[KRS-One]
For me, what you see is what you get in these days
I'm so hungry you can throw my dinner right on the stage
You can bite down on my rage, bite down on my anticipation
With no doubt or hesitation, repeat this affirmation
(I WILL MAKE IT) Not I wanna make it
(SHOW 'EM HOW WE MAKE IT) In fact, we've made it
Every time we state and believe it we create it
The power of your very word is highly underrated
Sleepin in the dark in the park watchin others push they cart
Say this whole thing in your heart

[KRS] I will make it

[HWC] I will make it!

[KRS] They can fake it

[HWC] (??)

[KRS] Time that I state it

[HWC] I can create it

[KRS] I create it

[HWC] No one can make it

[KRS-One]
For me, I ain't askin I ain't beggin I ain't pleadin
In a positive direction my lifestyle I'm leadin
I'm readin about ways of achievin what I'm believin
Every time I'm speakin I'm seein myself leapin
Over buildings, over the one on the corner chillin
Straight into knowledge of self, countin up millions
Changin my situation, with creative visualization
Givin libation for this ancient information

[KRS] I will make it

[HWC] I will make it!

[KRS] They can fake it

[HWC] (??)

[KRS] Time that I state it

[HWC] I can create it

[KRS] I create it

[HWC] No one can make it

[KRS] For me

[HWC] I will make it.. cause you're gonna make it!

[HWC] I will make it.. cause you're gonna make it!

[HWC] I will make it.. cause you're gonna make it!

[Hook x2]
First thing we must do is make up our - MIND
Then we must go and really clear our - MIND
Erase the doubt and the fear from our - MIND
Share our - MIND, speak our - MIND

[Verse 1]
Stand up brother, stand up sister
I told y'all before, love is gonna get'cha
Lovin that money, lovin that liquor
Lovin that sex without respect you gets no bigger
I ain't got time to chill, only got time to build
You find that in those with skills
This a real MC, of the highest degree
With no video, my show they dyin to see
Not whether I'm buyin 'em three
When you watch television just keep sayin they lyin to me
Cause they are - how long you gonna stay at the bar?
I'm not desperate for money, maybe you are, but listen

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
Don't you think it's time we thought about the future?
Whether our children they gonna be winners or losers?
Don't you think it's time to advance the rhyme we spit?
Whether you know it or not, you deep in politics
All inside of it, in fact YOU the issue
Don't let this government diss you!
They really do not want you to vote
They really do not want you to hope
They really want you sniffin' they coke
You look around yo we missin' the boat
I could've wrote about ANYTHING to get on, but this what I wrote
And what I'm writin', is guaranteed to enlighten
Like Dr. Cornel West, Michael Eric Dyson
This is how we do it today, enough of the crime talk
KRS got somethin' new to say
Rise up, and put aside childish things
This is the message we bring; listen

[Hook x2]

[KRS-One]
Last verse, KRS, blast first
Ignorance is bad, but temptation that's worse
They hide they purse, cause of the way we spit the verse
No one ever told 'em that the style's rehearsed
And even if they did, it wouldn't be new to they mind
Cause all day rappers confess to doin' these crimes
So when the cops see you, they're not thinkin' about me
They thinkin' about takin' you out of society
Keep it right, don't lie to me
You think it's too much preachin' teachin'?
Huh, well fine, we'll see
When you're locked up in J.D.C., or even prison
The truth shall set you free, just listen
You want health, and really that's about prevention
You want love, real love, and not depression
You want awareness, which come from discipline and will
You want wealth, which come from skills
When you really ready to talk, let's build
You ain't gotta be a scholar to know the next 4 years gonna be ill
I believe you already know the drill, don't lie
Don't steal, seek peace and don't kill

[Hook x2]
(ENEMY OF THE STATE)

[Intro: Diddy]
Uh huh
It's that dirty money
Uh huh
It's that dirty money

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I see, diamond flooded demons, Lamborghini angels
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
Windows up, system bumping, you the one they sang to
Same two, who said they the ones you should send your thanks through
Pockets full of blessings, they can sanctify and saint you
You can hear them revving/reverend up in heaven now, can't you?
Sandals made of chrome, his soul made of leather
An engine full of sinning and candy painted feathers
The sound of the motor only revving/reverend you confess to
I see this all in the eyes of the girl I'm next to
I asked her "Where we going?" and she just told me "Pleasure"
Hands on the wheel and her heels on the acceler-
-rator, told her wait up, she kept going like et cetera
Or like a broken record, we've come too far to just wheel it back selector
So we going ride forever, forever, forever, forever, forever

[Diddy]
It's that Dirty Money...
Came from heaven just to sing a song for you...
To the rhythm of my love for you, and now it's beatin slow
And you know, this the ennnnd of the road
When I sing that slow song for you...
And love was nothin but another gun for you ('nother gun for you..)
And I would hide it in my helpless soul
I'm not afraid to go down the road where we go
I don't know, you can hear 'em callin, don't you?
When the angels call like..

[Hook: Diddy] (Dawn)
You!
If you don't wanna stay you can go, oh
It seems love don't live here no more
The angels are flyin so loooow, singin to you
(Don't you hear me callin you?)
He's the one you love... (cause I hear 'em callin me...)
And he's the one you trust... (...like our time is almost through)
Time is runnin out (There's nothin left to do)
When they're callin you...
When the angels call like.. (I answeeeeer)

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, said she was a fan of mine
Knew she was New Jersey, but said that she was Anaheim
Butterflies turn to suicides, now it's phantoms flying
Used to whisper in my ear, but now she trying to Vander mine
That holy feeling/Holyfield all gone, slowly feeling all wrong
None of this is satisfying, pull it over, let me out
I'll just hitchhike back to mine
Nothing's really as it seems, yeah I should of known that
Thought I called a angel, devils had my phones tapped

[Intro]
(ENEMY OF THE STATE)
(ENEMY OF THE STATE)
Uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go

[Verse 1]
Microphone check, I make them all bounce
Every teller in Bank of America, make them all count
You gone need the whole staff to add up the amount
It's going to take to pay me off to keep me out your house
To keep me in my zone so that I don't zone out
I'm Rich and Po like Zone 4, thoughts is deep like Tone Loc
Walk with me like old folk, cross your street a score's goaled
I don't rap, I hockey rink, cause my flow is so cold
I am on my "mmhmm," they are on they "Oh, No!"
I am really in here/hair, they ain't real like Soul Glo
Don't you know I'm so sure, them nigga's got no glow
Find a master 'fore you can come back into the dojo
Lupe got his mind right, nigga this is my mic
And I've come to take it all back like Miller High Life
He must not be tied tight, back against the wall
He will throw a ball like he playing Jai Alai
I'll do the register, you just get them fries right
I don't trust America after watching Zeitgeist
Take a look at my stripes, chest looks like a tiger arm
And I'm hot as tiger balm, fire like a five-alarm
And it's set to Tire Barn, Get your fire-fighter on
I ain't worried about you hoes/hose, I don't even need to roll
I turn down your ex like how you put your tires on
Once I get these tires on, I buy a bomb and tie it on
And ride this around the entire song, find a line to drive it on
Park it near a metaphor, wait for it, the timer's on
You can turn your hydrants on, I'll just turn my wipers on
Wipe it off then wipe me down but don't forget about my bomb

[Hook]
The champ is here

[Verse 1]
Flow can't be seen
Like it took one in the face
I'm heavy nigga, tow can't be seen
Like I'm repossessing a Chevy nigga
Don't hang with those niggas those can't be safe
Even in they panic rooms
I will soon be forest to the floor of this
Stethoscope to the door of it
Listenin for the break
And I don't care how long gettin the combination takes
I be concentrating on the crack, get it straight
I was so high up the food chain that which I mentioned before
I ain't know how to make
I master shake like Aqua Teen Hunger Force
Already number one in the hood, G
It's like my third deal off Could Be
Get it focused, one of the coldest you gonna run across
Like it was stolen from a under boss
Spent for stack and sold to another boy
He might never get it back
So whoever got it getting whacked if they ever get caught
Now that's what I call reaction to a chain snatching
Game got bout as much compassion as The Passion
So it gotta make a comeback, just like a champion

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I run it back to that last piece of action
My necklace was took-en by detective
I don't stress it I just gather up my essence
As real as the view through my Cartier correctives, yeah
But now back to the punchin
Back to flo' like crunching
Got a 6 pack on the low now I'm sunk in
Look like I'm driving from the back seat
With a bird shotgun like I'm hunting
You see what happened
I made a call, and she got fly
I was pumping, hit her up
Then I sent my dog to go and pick her up
Camouflaged fitted cut to the left velours, how I did it up
And to the whole Westside, I tip it up
And over to the single baby mama with no job that gotta WIC it up
To all my niggas in the CCDOC waiting on they quick collect to come
So they can live it up
And to my niggas that liquor they livers up and distribute cut in the belly
Sit it up

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
In the abdomen is Madison from which I came
But this my gang
FNF crew, first and fifteen
Bear arms like Labatt Blue
Oh yes its bullets in the toasters as many as the clips that the gun hold
And they itchin to come up out the magazine like the posters that unfold
So my heat like Tigerbeat
I got the shotgun and the driver's seat
So if Lupe's a coupe, my man is a sedan
If there's more than 2 of us, then you up against a van
If I'm leavin, then you leavin
If your niggas wanna come, y'all can ride with me
It's just gonna be a lot of squeezin
Ya understand?
That I don't need Caroline calculator to divide defeat
Just lean a little closer
The flows are his as roses is
So override your pride and decide retreat
It's suicide to meet
Like a broke stock broker and a sidewalk
Y'all niggas ain't fly as me
That's why I defy physics and y'all niggas collidin, peace
I'm up here with the Leers
Y'all down down there with the airs
Emperors in the mirror, you're playing with a pair
Nigga I is we
Twice the MC like mc-squared
Trust, I make it relate
I got the poker-face and I'm hiding a flush
Still riding the beat
With a air that still smells like roses from André 3000
My housing surroundings is what made me me
And that's two times the G
You see how I doubled that the third time, nigga please

[Hook]
See I live it, Charlie
And then I write it, pimping
Then I record it, dirty
Then it's a song!
But then they hate on me
Cuz they can't take, homie
That I might break, homie
From my home

Which is the west side
F I wicked as the witches from the
West side in the wizard
You see I live it, scribble it
Deliver it, then I distribute it
To my niggas, But yet I
For the life of me
Can't understand the rivalry
Said about my number one fan, my man
He used to ride with me
But now he spitefully uses fighting words to frighten me
Slightly perturbed I war at his words rightfully
I should be lightning like in his ass
But I pass and lightly brush off the ash
From the square of that square
You see I really don't care
But it's a whole lot of insulted niggas over here
Bear in mind some of them mind, all of them won't
Some of them rhyme, all of them don't
Most of them grind, all of them inclined
To see you signed and combined
To be on your ass so serious
You see I live it, Charlie
And then I write it, pimping
Then I record it, dirty
Then it's a song!
But then they hate on me
Cuz they can't take, homie
That I might break, homie
From my home

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
So I think you had enough
What up Chuck? FNF up
RKF tux, adjust my cuffs
John Lennon Chucks, Independent Trucks
Yup, a little bit of dust
Brush my shoulder
Plus, a little bit of church
Uh, I showed you
Just a little bit of what can happen
If you open up your eyes and imagine
Expand your horizons with rhyming and rapping
Quit rapping and rhyming bout coke and supplying
And clapping is anyone out there or are y'all all absent?

[Hook: Gorillaz]
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last to get away
To some another day?
Or do we know why we love?
Doesn't seem to be conveyed that way
Are we the

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Fahrenheit 1/15 part III
One time to the FNF army
After party in the Angel Nights RV
Don't forget your cell phones and car keys
Don't forgot to tip the valet where you park please
I wish you well
Good night, drive safe, A Rhyming Ape t-shirts on sale

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Once upon a time not long ago
An idea, yeah, that's what I had
To take "Demon Days" and a little Pro Tools
With my MCing ways and make them mash
Just having fun not chasing cash
Apologize now if it make you mad
Had to call G Ball, tell him warm up the mic
Put the padding on the wall, time to make some magic
Studio is nothing lavish
Matter of fact, it's just an attic
Background noise from the fan
That hitting the mic stand and the outside traffic
Still turns out fantastic
Turn my vocals up just a tad bit
Fresh from the 1st & 15th
Quarantine touching you, super cool, now that's sick

[Chorus: 2-D]
Windmill, windmill for the land
Learn forever hand in hand
Take it all, let on your stride
It is sticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
So sit on back and enjoy the show
Then lean on forward and enjoy some more
And then, sit back again
And keep on enjoying like you was enjoying before
Whether you enjoy the beats or enjoy the flow
As long as you enjoying it, it bring joy to Joe
And Joe is me but woe is me
If you and yours ain't enjoying the show
So, don't worry about the time it take
If you ain't got one better find a date
A beautiful inside or a dime that take
I proudly present to you A Rhyming Ape
My rhymes are straight
If you ain't got one better find a date
A beautiful inside or a dime that take
I proudly present to you A Rhyming Ape

[Chorus: 2-D]
Windmill, windmill for the land
Learn forever hand in hand
Take it all, let on your stride
It is sticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

[Intro]
Neeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrdd!
Westside, Baby, what's good?
I'm only gonna do this once, man, once
Till the album come
So, check it out

[Verse]
From the M-A...D-I, to the S to the O-N
Potent, to get ya open
Moving like a nigga supposed to get the dough
In the 'Go with the flow that I'm holdin'
Yo, man, they ain't "On Enuff" or up on enough
To stay in the zone that I go in
That I go in, when I go in and go in
Of the poems, that were wrote and
Crucial Conflict was smokin'
But a nigga like me, I don't be chokin'
So I proceed at a low speed, low key
Like a OG in a '03 Loc-in'
Rollin' like a OZ, in a b-leaf
Both pins, like a bowlin' ball when I ball
But I never fall for the okey-dokin'
Whitewalls and the slow-speed motion
Stash-box for the police pokin'
Rolie showin, shorty showin, Hokey Pokin'
Turnin' it around with me
To bust 'em down cause they know he golden
Exactly, I'm in it from the minute I was in it
'Til the minute that I spit it and I'm finished
And it's sad for me
Until the second wind, and reinvent it with a vengeance
Revisit it and make 'em give it back to me

[Outro]
All right, that's all you get
I'm done, you know what I'm sayin'?
In the streets where the traffic be, nigga, what
Shout out to all of Chi-Town
Crucial Conflict!
Wildstyle, what's good? Coldhard, what up?
Never, what up? Kilo, what up?
Psycho Drama! The Snipers!
Do or Die! Um, let me see
Twista! C-Wall! Legit Ballaz!
Um, Traxster, what up, baby?
Um, who else out there?
Oh! Triple Darkness!
Um, Soldiers at War! Um, who else?
Y'all gotta forgive if I, if I can't remember everybody
But, y'know, there was some people that had a lotta influence
On the kid
Revenge!

[Lupe Fiasco]
Whattup, this Lupe Fiasco
And you're watchin the Pepsi Max NFL Audible

[Nick Javas]
Hello sports fans, we're comin down to the nitty gritty
Who will be representin the city?
It's the moment that motivated you back in two-a-days
Allow me to pass it off to Lupe, get 'em!

[Lupe Fiasco]
Welcome to Chi-Town, lie down, nah never that
Packers and the Bears in the battle that, never lacks
They go forever back, to the days of Butkus
And Nitschke was simply on this planet just to run blitz

[Nick Javas]
Up against each other in this
The 182nd clash of titans, do the math
They're bitter rivals for 10 short of a century
No time to be friendly, who's applyin the better D?

[Lupe Fiasco]
For Chicago, comin off the end is a beast
Far as I know, Julius the Pepper to beat

[Nick Javas]
Put the season on it but Jennings steadily beats
The best of the DB's to get him his TD's
12 on the year like his quarterback wears
But he won't be signin any autographs here
The cornerback Bears got their hands to a button hook
Like you ain't got your guard up like when that man pulls

[Lupe Fiasco]
But the Packers better punt it out of bounds
Or Hester's, gonna turn them into clowns and jesters
And 22 be runnin through, they hummin blues
While beat jacks stay outside of the beat gaps
And why would you insist on tryin to split, Brian and Briggs
Supplyin the hits, denyin them six
So cue the violins for the losers, a bruise to the ego
A Superbowl ring is bein repo'd

[Nick Javas]
And it was right there, but now it lives in your nightmare
The pride of a Packer verse the fight of a Bear
The lion's share could only go to the king
See you next week, or see you in the spring

[Lupe Fiasco]
Dreams of rings that gleam upon the mantle are cancelled
If you plan to win it playin timid

[Nick Javas]
Quite the challenge; who's gonna be tryin their talents
In that one final fight in the Palace? ...

Pepsi Max
Zero calories, maximum Pepsi taste

[Verse 1]
I'm feelin' like, I ain't feelin' right
I'm feelin' like, I'm finna fly
Right in the sky, unidentified
Flying object, that I sit inside
You can get a ride, just get in line
Hand by your heart, like memorize
Ask Scotty please, could you energize?
Beam on up, to the Enterprise
From the inner city, or the Windy City
Where's Mini-mini? Not Mini-me's
Only Mini-me's, not a lot of hymns
Only one eye, whole lot of them
Saw a cyclops, that's a eye clock
Like a Rolex, with a eye patch
See what I got, matches on the wall
Plus a crazy flow, suicide watch
I'm just killin' time, plus I'm insane
In a straight jacket, but it's Romanelli
I'm just gettin' back, for now it's kinda poor
Want to have things, couldn't afford a Pelle
So don't mind me, cause I ain't got a mind
I don't front hard, I ain't got a mind
I'm just gettin' mine, but don't step here
Because it's something buried, that I didn't find
And if I’m on top like a mohawk
I remember when, I was so not
It was no locks, man I couldn't ball
I was so bald, Robocop
I was Mr. Clean, now I'm Mr. T
But a different team, F&F rules
Call me F.I., from the Westside
And I'm underground, pepperin' you fool (yeah homey)

[Hook 1]
Creepin' on a come up, history, we gonna rewrite that
Left for a minute but I told you I'll be right back
I know you're slummin' and you feel me want to be like that
Well you can't see me, that's cause everything is black
(Black, black, black, black, black, black, black)

[Verse 2]
And I'm feelin' good, like a villian would
If he was doin' bad, kill Superman
Tied to a log, pushed into a saw
Take a little dog, right through the fan
And it mean man, like a dictionary
Like a definition, like you never listen
Not the "ition" endin', but the deaf part
Break it in half, like an intermission
You'll see then, what I mean then
Or what I meant there, doesn't impair
Now you're learnin' it, keep rehearsin' it
'Til it's permanent, like pimp hair
Got an empire, I'm the emperor
Like the cat were, I'll be faster
You're tryin' to add syrup, just to slow me down
But I blow 'em down, like I'm half-were
That's wolf-man, you got a full house
I got a full moon, then I pull out
The ace up my sleeve, like my hand hurt
Lend me your chips, what they took now
What they put now, gotta look down
And check your shoulder, cause I'll be over
Like a boater, you got boulders
In your loafers, put your foot down
While I Ottoman, or a Laz-E-Boy
Or a handstand, see I elevate
Like Otis, my toes is
And my flow sick, let it marinate
Try to break it down, might take a while
All good though, I'll wait around
While you chase it down, that white rabbit
Down that long hole, like paper towels (yeah homey)

[Hook 2]
Creepin' on her, come up mystery, we gonna rewrite that
Left for a minute but I tell you I'll be right back
I know you're slummin' and you feel me want to be like that
Well you can't see me, that's cause everything is black
(Black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black)
(Black, black, black, black, black, everything is black)
(Black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black)
(Black, black, black, black, you can't see me)

[Verse 3]
So this light's out, like a lighthouse
In the daytime, make it lay down
Make it go to bed, make it go to sleep
Like Deebo, when he was chokin' Craig
That's a headlock, it's what I said I got
The whole game in, like shooter box
Then the Sho Kosugi, if you don't know the movies
I ninja vanish, Michael Dudikoff
I get super low, I get super lost
I be super cool, like a super boss
Say they super bad, but they super soft
Like super chicken, without the super sauce
Let's step out, it's a rap now
Blow your candles, and your lamps out
When I pull up, you can pull the plug
Cause it's game over, it's a black out

[Hook 2]
Creepin' on her, come up mystery, we gonna rewrite that
Left for a minute but I tell you I'll be right back
I know you're slummin' and you feel me want to be like that
Well you can't see me, that's cause everything is black
(Black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black)
(Black, black, black, black, black, everything is black)
(Black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black)
(Black, black, black, black, you can't see me)
And now, the tale from the darkside...

[DMX]
Uh, I got to remind y'all niggas
What the fuck flow is all about
Huh, its about this
Anywhere from forty-eight and up
Straight, you feel me?
Fifty fifty

Aiyyo, I gots to hear the beat so I can eat, ahight?
If I can't live, you can't live, ain't nothin sweet
Bitch ass niggas think its all about Versace
A week later them niggas talkin about (Yo, X got me)
I thought he was my man, but he act like he ain't know me
I knew he had the joint, but I didn't wanna make him show me
That nigga be buggin, stickin cats up and random
Doing his dirt and disappearin like the phantom
Niggas can't stand him, but ask me if I care
'Cuz what I used to give a fuck about, just ain't there
And ain't nothing fair, I knew this for a long time
Thats why with ever wrong crime comes another strong rhyme
And thats mo' time under the belt, you felt what I had
And I shouldn't have even done it, thats what made this shit sad
I'm doin' bad, but if I gots to feel it, you gots to feel it
And if a nigga can't afford it, I gots to steal it
And that's how real it, GETS, when this shit hits the fan
You still tryin to get the man, first catch up with the man
Then we gon' see what'choo made of
If your shit ain't pumpin Kool-Aid, what you afraid of?
The monster under the bed, three or four slugs to the head
Or ya babies mother missin for a month, found dead
Worms comin' from places you stuck ya dick in
Maggots got the bitch coverered and the smells sick'nen
Plastic don't hide the smell for too long, I do wrong
And so I don't have nightmares I forget about it, move on
Keep gettin my groove on, 'cuz that shit could fuck with'choo
Keep dwellin on it, and its gonna get stuck with you
Niggas try their luck with you, 'cuz they smell ass
And money if you pussy, I'm gonna be able to tell fast
So cop I'm about to smack across the face in this robbery
I'm on a robbin spree, and ain't no STOPPIN ME
On this real, thats why a nigga stay writin
'Cuz kid this shit is real, what you think we play fightin
You must of saw som'thin funny, or never saw som'thin bloody
Or you don't know I'll bring it to your door 'cuz I'm cruddy
Like puddy, when I hold you niggas, I mold you niggas
I done told you niggas, that I been owed you niggas
For that shit you did that you wasn't built for
Shit I guess you didn't know you do get killed for
I done filled niggas up with the extended clip
Its like I blew this joint down with the extended rip
Or that non-stop, when the bomb drops
I'mma take it from where you at and then end up on ya moms block
From here to Comstock, niggas gettin bust wide
Cell cagers last night from lock out just died?
Ain't no where to hide, ain't no wear to run
What more can they do to a man that ain't been done
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
Especially if its all over the place, your mind all over his face
How do brains taste, when they mixed with gun powder
Semi to fully automatic makes the gun louder
I got som'thin to fix pain when I kicks game
'Cuz I'mma flowed off more tracks than the 6 train
You 'bout to get flamed, from ash to ashes to DIRT
You gon' go with the dough that your life was worth
MOTHERFUCKER...

[Chorus 1]
Everything is everything
What is meant to be will be
After winter must come spring (Must come spring)
Change, it comes eventually
Everything is everything
What is meant to be will be
After winter must come spring (Must come)
Change, it comes eventually

[Verse 1]
I wrote these words (I wrote these words) for everyone who struggles in their youth
Who won't accept deception in, instead of what is truth (Gotta know the truth, y'all)
It seems we lose the game
Before we even start to play
Who made these rules? (Who made these rules?)
We're so confused (We're so confused)
Easily led astray
Let me tell ya that...

[Chorus 2]
Everything is everything
Everything is everything
Everything is everything (Everything)
After winter must come spring
Everything is everything

[Verse 2]
Our philosophy possibly speak tongues
Beat drum, Abyssinian, street Baptist (Word)
Rap this in fine linen, from the beginning (Word)
My practice extending across the atlas, I begat this
Flipping in the ghetto on a dirty mattress
You can't match this rapper slash actress
More powerful than two Cleopatras
Bomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti (Ooh, uh)
MCs ain't ready to take it to the Serengeti
My rhymes is heavy like the mind of sister Betty (El Shabazz!)
L-Boogie spars with stars and constellations (What?)
Then came down for a little conversation (Huh)
Adjacent to the king, fear no human being
Roll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum (What?)
Now hear this mixture, where Hip Hop meets scripture (Uh)
Develop a negative into a positive picture

[Chorus 1]
Now everything is everything (Everything, y'all, everything, y'all)
What is meant to be will be (What is meant to be will be, yeah)
After winter must come spring (After winter, must come spring)
Change, it comes eventually (Change, it comes eventually)

[Verse 3]
Sometimes it seems we'll touch that dream (Sometimes it seems we'll touch that dream)
But things come slow or not at all (They come slow, know what I mean?)
And the ones on top won't make it stop (Ones on top, they won't make it stop)
So convinced that they might fall
Let's love ourselves and we can't fail
To make a better situation (Better situation, uh-uh)
Tomorrow, our seeds will grow (Tomorrow, our seeds will grow)
All we need is dedication
Let me tell ya that

[Chorus 2]
Everything is everything
Everything is everything
Everything is everything (Everything is everything)
After winter must come spring
Everything is everything (Everything is everything)

[Chorus 1]
Everything is everything
What is meant to be will be
After winter (After winter) must come spring (Must come)
Change, it comes eventually
Nothing can be done against the truth
No matter how we remain in denial, yeah
Wasting time, replacing time with each empty excuse
But that'll only work a little while
Coping with despair, knowing you're not there
Ashamed to just admit I've been a fool
So I blame it on the sun, run away from everyone
Hoping to escape this ridicule
Trapped in misery, wrapped so miserably
And this deception, I wear it like a skin
Dying to maintain, oh I keep trying to explain
A heart that never loved me to begin
Oh I'm such a mess, I have no choice but to confess
That I've been desperately trying to belong
Lieing to myself and everybody else
Refusing to admit my right was wrong

[Refrain:]
And then He came
Selah, oh and it means
Praise and meditation, and then He came
Selah, oh and it means
Did you think about that, and then He came
Selah, oh and it means
Praise and meditation, and then He came
Selah, oh and it means
That it is seen
How beautiful is fruit still in denial of its roots
My guilty heart behaves so foolishly
This treason from within that reasons with my sin
Won't be happy till it sees the death of me
Selfishly addicted to a life that I depicted
Conflicted cause it's not reality
Oh what's left of me, I beg you desperately
Cause me to agree with what I know is best for me
Please save me from myself, I need you, save me from myself
Please save me from myself so I can heal
The choices that I've made, oh have been nothing but mistakes
What a wasted use of space, should I die before I wake
In all of my religion, I've fortified this prison
Obligated to obey the demands of bad decisions
Please save me from myself, I need you
Save me from myself, please save me from myself so I can heal

[Refrain]

And then He came
And then He came, then He came, then He came
And then He
And then He came

[Intro]
Yo, y-yo, yo, y-yo
Yo, uh, yo, y-yo, yo, y-yo

[Verse 1]
It could all be so simple (Ba-ba-ba-baby, baby, baby)
But you'd rather make it hard (Huh, uh)
Loving you is like a battle (It's like a battle)
And we both end up with scars

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me who I have to be (Who I have to be)
To get some reciprocity
See, no one loves you more than me (More than me)
And no one ever will (No one ever will, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Is this just a silly game (Silly game)
That forces you to act this way? (To act this way)
Forces you to scream my name
Then pretend that you can't stay (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, who I have to be (I know what we gotta do)
To get some reciprocity
See, no one loves you more than me
And no one ever will

[Chorus]
No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't working (It ain't working, no), it ain't working
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, this is crazy (Oh, this is crazy, uh-huh)

[Verse 3]
I keep letting you back in (You back in)
How can I explain myself? (I don't understand why)
As painful as this thing has been
I just can't be with no one else

[Pre-Chorus]
See I know what we've got to do (Yeah)
You let go (You let go), and I'll let go too (And I'll let go)
Cause no one's hurt me more than you (No one's hurt me more than you)
And no one ever will

[Chorus]
No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't working (It ain't working), it ain't working (It ain't working)
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, (This is crazy) Oh, this is crazy (This is crazy)

[Breakdown]
(Care) Care for me, care for me
I know you care for me
(There) There for me, there for me
Said you'd be there for me
(Cry) Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me
(Give) Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me?
(Care) Care for me, care for me
You said you'd care for me
(There) There for me, there for me
Said you'd be there for me

You said you'd die for me
(Care) Where?
(There) Where?
(Cry) Where were you
(Give) When I needed you?
(Care, there, cry, give)

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
(Da, da, da, d-da, d-da) Where were you
(Da, da, da, d-da, d-da) When I needed you?
(Da, da, da, d-da, d-da) Where were you?
(Da, da, da, d-da, d-da) You, you, you, you, you
(Da, da, da, d-da, d-da) You, do, do, do, do, do, do, do

(Da, da, da, d-da, d-da)

[Intro]
Uh-uh
Uh
And yo
Uhh, uhh (Like fungus among us)
Yo, yo (Haha), uh

[Verse 1]
Yo, I treat this like my thesis
Well-written topic, broken down into pieces
I introduce then produce, words so profuse
It's abuse how I juice up this beat, like I'm deuce
Two people both equal like I'm Gemini, rather Simeon
If I Jimmy on this lock I could pop it, you can't stop it
Drop it, your whole crew microscopic
Like particles while I make international articles, and on the cover
Don't discuss the baby mother (Nah)
Business, I been in this third LP you can't tell me
I witness first-handed, I'm candid, you can't stand it
Respect demanded, and get flown around the planet
Rock Hard like granite or steel
People feel Lauryn Hill from New-Ark to Israel
And this is real, so I keep makin' the street's ballads
While you lookin' for dressin' to go with your tossed salad

[Chorus]
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour

[Verse 2]
I'm about to change the focus from the richest to the brokest
I wrote this opus, to reverse the hypnosis
Whoever's closest to the line's gonna win it
You gonna fall trying to ball while my team win the pennant
I'm about to begin it, for a minute, then run for senate
Make a slum lord be repentant, give his money to kids to spend it
And then amend it, every law that ever prevented
Our survival since our arrival documented in The Bible
Like Moses and Aaron, things gon' change, it's apparent
And all the transparent gonna be seen through
Let God redeem you, keep your deen true, you can get the green too
Watch out what you cling to, observe how a queen do
And I remain calm reading the 73rd Psalm
'Cause with all that’s going on I got the world in my palm

[Chorus]
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour

[Verse 3]
Now I be breaking bread sipping Manischewitz wine
Pay no mind party like it's 1999
But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine
Say your rhymes, let's see if that get you out your bind
Now I'ma get the mozzarella like a Rockafeller
Still be in the church of Lalibela, singing hymns a cappella
Whether posed in Mirabella in Couture
Or collecting residuals from off The Score
I'm making sure I'm with the 144
I've been here before this ain't a battle, this is war
Word to Boonie, I make salat like a Sunni
Get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community
Had opportunity went from Hoodshock to Hood-chic
But it ain't what you cop, it's about what you keep
And even if there are leaks, you can't capsize this ship
'Cause I baptize my lips every time I take a sip

[Chorus]
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour

[Intro: Shelly Thunder]
Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us
Although them again we will never, never, never trust
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Them nuh know what them do
Dig out your eye, while I'm sticking like glue
Fling, skin, grin, while them plotting for you, true!

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & Shelly Thunder]
Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do (Me a tell you, dem nuh know)
Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do (Fi be real, them nuh have a clue!)

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
Beware the false motives of others
Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers
And you never suppose it's those who are closest to you
To you
They say all the right things to gain their position
Then use your kindness as their ammunition
To shoot you down in the name of ambition, they do
Oh

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do
Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]
Why every Indian wanna be the chief?
Feed a man till he full and he still want beef
Give me grief, try to tief off my piece
Why for you to increase, I must decrease?
If I treat you kindly, does it mean that I'm weak?
You hear me speak and think I won't take it to the streets
I know enough cats that don't turn the other cheek
But I try to keep it civilized, like Menelik
And other African czars, observing stars with war scars
Get yours in this capitalistic system
So many caught or got bought you can't list them
How you gon' idolize the missing? To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition
Even when they coming, gunning I stand position
L's known the mission since conception
Let's free the people from deception
If you looking for the answers, then you gotta ask the questions
And when I let go, my voice echoes through the ghetto
Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto
Why black people always be the ones to settle?
March through these streets like Soweto, uhh

[Bridge: Lauryn Hill]
Like Cain and Abel, Caesar and Brutus
Jesus and Judas, backstabbers do this

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do
Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do

[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill]
It took me a little while to discover
Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers
Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves, to themselves
A friend once said, and I found to be true
That everyday people, they lie to God too
So what makes you think, that they won't lie to you?

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & Shelly Thunder]
Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do (Forgive them, forgive them)
Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do (Forgive them, forgive them)

[Verse 4: Shelly Thunder & Lauryn Hill]
Gwan like dem love you, while dem rip you to shreds
Trample pon yuh heart, and leff you fi dead
Dem a yuh friend, who you depend pon, from way back when
( 

[?] to grace)
But if you, gi' dem yuh back, then you must meet yuh end
Dem nuh know what dem do do
(Who's gonna be the one?)
Dem nuh know what dem do do
(Gotta be the one to say)
Dem nuh know, dem nuh know, dem nuh know, dem nuh know
Dem nuh know what dem do do
(Oh, yeah, oh)

[Outro: Lauryn Hill]
(Forgive them, Father, forgive them, Father...)

[Verse 1]
It's funny how money change a situation
Miscommunication lead to complication
My emancipation don't fit your equation
I was on the humble, you on every station
Some wan' play young Lauryn like she dumb
But remember not a game new under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from Bricks to Kingston
My ting done made your kingdom wan' run
Now understand, L-Boogie, non-violent
But if a thing test me, run for mi gun
Can't take a threat to mi new born son
L been this way since creation
A groupie call, you fall from temptation
Now you wanna bawl over separation
Tarnish my image in the conversation
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion?
You might win some but you just lost one

[Chorus]
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one

[Verse 2]
Now, now, how come your talk turn cold?
Gained the whole world for the price of your soul
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control
Now you're all floss, what a sight to behold
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
I was hopeless, now I'm on Hope Road
Every man wanna act like he's exempt
Need to get down on his knees and repent
Can't slick talk on the day of judgment
Your movement's similar to a serpent
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?
Consequence is no coincidence
Hypocrites always wanna play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it time for punishment
I know you don't wanna hear my opinion
There come many paths and you must choose one
And if you don't change then the rain soon come
See you might win some, but you just lost one

[Chorus]
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one

[Refrain]
You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly, how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from (Gain from)
What you done done? It's so silly, how come?
(You done, how come?)
You just lost one

[Verse 3]
Now don't you understand, man, universal law?
What you throw out comes back to you, star
Never underestimate those who you scar
'Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard
You can't hold God's people back that long
The chain of Shatan wasn't made that strong
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song
And some don't know what they have ‘til it's gone
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
Now, some might listen and some might shun
And some may think that they've reached perfection
If you look closely you'll see what you've become
'Cause you might win some but you just lost one

[Chorus]
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one

[Refrain]
You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly, how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done? It's so silly, how come?
You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly, how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done? It's so silly, how come?
You just lost one
You just lost one, you just lost one
You just lost one, you just lost one
(How come, you lost one? It's so dumb)
You just lost one, you just lost one
You just lost one
What a bam-bam!... hehehe

[Skit]

[Verse 1]
I was just a little girl
Skinny legs, a press and curl
My mother always thought I'd be a star
But way before the record deals
Streets that nurtured Lauryn Hill
Made sure that I'd never go too far

[Chorus]
Every ghetto, every city
And suburban place I been
Make me recall my days, in New Jerusalem

[Verse 2]
Story starts in Hootaville
Grew up next to Ivy Hill
When kids were stealing quartervilles for fun
"Kill the Guy" in Carter Park
Rode a Mongoose 'til it's dark
Watching kids show off the stolen ones

[Chorus]
Every ghetto, every city
And suburban place I been
Make me recall my days, in the New Jerusalem

[Refrain]
You know it's hot
Don't forget, what you got
Looking back.. looking back, looking back, looking back
You know it's hot
Don't forget, what you got
Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back

[Verse 3]
Bag of Bontons, twenty cents and a nickel (well that's a quarter)
Springfield Ave. had the best popsicles
Saturday morning cartoons and Kung-Fu (wuh-TAH!)
Main street roots tonic with the dreads
A beef patty and some coco bread
Move the patch from my Lee's to the tongue of my shoes
'Member, Freling-Huysen used to have the bomb leather
Back when Doug Fresh and Slick Rick was together
Looking at the crew, we thought we'd all live forever

[Refrain]
You know it's hot
Don't forget, what you got
Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back
You know it's hot
Don't forget, what you got
Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back

[Verse 4]
Drill teams on Munn street
'Member when Hawthorne and Chancellor had beef
Moving Records was on Central Ave
I was there at dancing school
South Orange Ave. at Borlin pool
Unaware of what we didn't have
Writing my friends' names on my jeans with a marker
July 4th races outside Parker
Fireworks at Martin Stadium
The Untouchable P.S.P
Where all them crazy niggas be
And car thieves got away through Irvington
Hillside brings beef with the cops
Self Destruction record drops
And everybody's name was Muslim (children playing, women producing)
Sensations and eighty-eight
Attracted kids from out of state
And everybody used to do the wop (wop it out, wop it out, wop it out)
Jack ya, jack ya, jack ya body
Nah, the BizMark used to amp up the party
I wish those days, they didn't stop

[Chorus]
Every ghetto, every city
And suburban place I been
Make me recall my days, in New Jerusalem

[Refrain]
You know it's hot
Don't forget, what you got
Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back
You know it's hot
Don't forget, what you got
Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back
You know it's hot
Don't forget, what you got
Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back

[Outro]
Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back
Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back
Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back
Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back
Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back

[Intro]
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
As I look at what I've done
The type of life that I've lived
How many things I pray the father will forgive
One situation involved a young man
He was the ocean and I was the sand
He stole my heart like a thief in the night
Dulled my senses and blurried my sight
And I used to love him

[Chorus]
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige & Lauryn Hill]
I chose the road of passion and pain (passion and pain)
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain
Gave up my power ceased being queen
Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend
See, torn and confused, wasted and used
Reached the crossroad which path would I choose
Stuck and frustrated, I waited, debated
For something to happen that just wasn't fated
Thought what I wanted was something I needed
When momma said no then I just should have heeded
Misled I bled 'till the poison was gone
And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn

[Chorus]
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't

[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill & Mary J. Blige]
Father you saved me and you showed me that life
Was much more than being some foolish man's wife
Showed me that love was respect and devotion
Greater than planets and deeper than any oceans
See, my soul was weary but now it's replenished
Content because that part of my life is finished
I see him sometimes and the look in his eye
Is one of a man who's lost treasures untold
But my heart is gold, see, I took back my soul
And totally let my creator control
The life which was his, the life which was his to begin with

[Chorus]
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't

[Outro]
I used to love him but now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
See, I used to love him

[Intro:]
"Every man has the technique; and they're all different. But when you know mine, you'll be DEAD"

Yo... (Can I see you?) Lauryn Hill on the track...
(In the morning) New Ark got my back...
DJ Skribble, just relax, haha! I'm a get you the joint! haha!
Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh!

[Verse:]
As I span the cosmos
Mahogany travel at the speed of sound
Span the mainstream but still esteemed underground
My parameters, and wrap up contaminants
Travel twice Earth's diameter, intimidating amateurs (what?!)
At the Apollo, I played the shepherd, sheep followed
Chicks try to model after me like I'm Tyra
Banks; wanna thank me 'cause my statements are prodigious
Styles so prestigious, make a sinner act religious
Street academics, seen alot of girls mimic (Huh)
But when it's all over you can tell who's the gimmick
L slang-bangs like a dub plate (Bing!)
Jericho Sound System, mash up your club dates!
Sweeter than a cherry on a fruit cocktail
Whenever, Wherever, Whatever like Maxwell (Unh)
My pentium makes more chips than Intel (Intel)
I didn't mean to turn you on like Cherrelle!
Kids move they body like they're tripping off of acid
Anthony, not even fantasy can surpass it
Once you blast it, one starts to feel kinky
I think he, goes by the name of Young Slinky
And just when you thought it was safe to relax
L-Boogie spits with perfect syntax!
Then, DJ Skribble make you dribble on the wax (What?)...
DJ Skribble make you dribble on the wax!
Can I hear you in the morning
Like I hear you late at night?
Chance to hear you, amp the party
DJ Skribble, keep it tight!
Just a short time in the morning
Like I hear you late at night
Chance to hear you, amp the party
DJ Skribble, keep it tight!

[John Forte: ]
L' Boogie
Y-yo.. y-yo.. uhh Y-yo.. y-yo.. uhh Y-y-yo.., yo, y-yo.. Y-y-yo..

It could all be simple but you'd rather make it hard
Loving you is like a battle we both end up scarred
Tell me who I have to be to get some reciprocity
No one loves you more than me and no one ever will
Is this just a silly game that forces you to act this way
Forces you to scream my name, then pretend, that you can't stay
Tell me who I have to be to get some reciprocity
No one loves you more than me and no one ever will

[HOOK:]
No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't workin, it ain't workin, uhh
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, this is crazy..

I keep letting you back in, how can I explain myself?
As crazy as this thing has been, I just can't be with no one else
I know what we've got to do, you let go I'll let go too
No one's hurt me more than you and no one ever will
Yo, y-yo, yo yo- I'm here now, not just because it's my year now
I'm clear now, only feelin cats that's sincere now
Heart of lioness, scientist, street Zionist
Don't twist it, it's consistantly consistent
If you missed it, this train is bound for glory
End of story, my whole repoitory is Psalm 40
They bomb for me
Thinkin they can mess with your plan, but I'mma play lamb
Knowin that the Kingdom's at hand, and showin those who want it
You gon' bring em the land, descendants of Ham
Not concerned with the platinum status
Cause every joint I threw, I would do for gratis
I'm on the train with my Pips like I'm lil Gladys
Or in the Range throwin chips to the kids in Addis (Ethiopia)
Ababa, two kids and and a baby father
Hot to lava, we Don Dadda, Don Dadda

[HOOK]

Care for me, care for me, I know you care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me!
Give to me, give to me..
Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me!
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
Ohh noo.. why won't you live for me?
Why..hahhhihhhhhh, won't you live, for me, for me, for meeee
Care for me, care for me, I know you care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me!
Give to meeeeeee..
Give to meeeeeee..
It could all be simple, but you'd rather make it hard..
Loving you, loving you, is like a bat-tle..

[Intro]
I gotta find peace of mind
I know another cord...
I gotta find peace of mind
See, this what that voice in your head says
When you try to get peace of mind
I gotta find peace of mind, I gotta find peace of mind

[Hook]
He says it's impossible, but I know it's possible
He says it's impossible, but I know it's possible

[Verse 1]
He says there's no me without him
Please help me forget about him
He takes all my energy, trapped in my memory
Constantly holding me, constantly holdin' me
I need to tell you all, all the pain he's caused, mm-mm-mm-mm
I need to tell you I'm
I'm undone because, mm-mm-mm-mm

[Chorus]
He says it's impossible, but I know it's possible
He says it's impossible without him, but I know it's possible

[Verse 2]
To finally be in love, and know the real meaning of
A lasting relationship, not based on ownership
I trust every part of You, 'cause all that I...
All that you say you do
You love me despite myself, sometimes I fight myself
I just can't believe that you, would have anything to do
With someone so insecure, someone so immature
Oh, you inspire me, to be the higher me

[Verse 3]
You make my desire pure, you make my desire pure
Just tell me what to say, I can't find the words to say
Please don't be mad with me, I have no identity
All that I've known is gone, all I was building on
I wanna walk with you, how do I talk to you

[Verse 4]
Touch my mouth with your hands
Touch my mouth with your hands
Oh I wanna understand, the meaning of your embrace
I know now I have to face the temptations of my past
Please don't let me disgrace, will my devotion last?
Now that I know the truth, now that it's no excuse

[Pre-Chorus]
Keeping me from your love, what was I thinking of?
Holding me from your love, what was I thinking of?
You are my peace of mind, that old me is left behind
You are my peace of mind, that old me is left behind

[Chorus]
He says it's impossible, but I know it's possible
He says it's improbable, but I know it's tangible
He says it's not grab-able, but I know it's have-able

[Bridge]
'Cause anything's possible, oh anything is possible
Please come free my mind, please come meet my mind
Can you see my mind? Oh
Won't you come free my mind?
Oh, I know it's possible
Anything, anything, anything, anything, anything, yeah
Anything, anything, anything, anything, yeah
Anything, anything, anything, anything, anything, yeah
Oh free! Free, free, free your mind
Free, free your mind... free, free your mind
Free, free, free, free your mind
Oh, it's so possible, oh it's so possible
I'm telling you it's possible, I'm telling you it's possible
Free, free... free, free... free, free... get free now
Free, free... free, free, free, free... free, free

[Chorus]
You're my peace of mind, that old me is left behind
You're my peace of mind, you're my peace of mind
He's my peace of mind, he's my peace of mind
He's my peace of mind, he's my peace of mind

[Outro]
What a joy it is to be alive
To get another chance, yeah
Everyday's another chance
To get it right this time
Everyday's another chance
Oh what a merciful, merciful, merciful God
Oh what a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful God

[Repeat till fade]

[Intro]
Whoa, ooh, umm, yeah, yeah
Whoa, ooh, whoa, ow yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
Now the skies could fall
Not even if my boss should call
The world, it seems so very small
'Cause nothing even matters at all
See, nothing even matters
See, nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all

[Verse 2: D'Angelo]
See, I don't need no alcohol
Your love make me feel ten feet tall (Yeah)
Without it, I'd go through withdrawal
'Cause nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing matters at all

[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill]
These buildings could drift out to sea
Some natural catastrophe
Still, there's no place I'd rather be
'Cause nothing even matters to me
See, nothing even matters (Yeah)
See, nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me

[Verse 4: D'Angelo]
You're part of my identity
I sometimes have a tendency
To look at you religiously (Baby, baby)
'Cause nothing even matters, to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me
Said it don't matter, baby, baby
Don't matter

[Verse 5: Lauryn Hill]
Now you won't find me at no store
I have no time for manicures
With you it's never either-or
'Cause nothing even matters no more
See, nothing, it don't matter
See, nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters no more

[Verse 6: D'Angelo]
Now my team could score
And make it to the Final Four
Just repossessed my four by four
'Cause nothing even matters no more
(No more, no more, no more)
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters
No, no more

[Outro: Lauryn Hill & D'Angelo]
To me, to me, to me, to me
To me, to me, to me, to me, to me, to me
(FREESTYLE SINGING TO END)

[Intro]
Yo hip-hop, started out in the heart
Uh-huh, yo
Now everybody tryin' to chart
Say what? Hip-hop, started out in the heart
Yo, now everybody tryin' to chart
C'mon now baby c'mon now baby c'mon now baby c'mon, uhh
C'mon now baby c'mon now baby c'mon now baby c'mon

[Chorus]
C'mon baby light my fire (Come on)
Everything you drop is so tired (Everything)
Music is supposed to inspire (Music is supposed to inspire)
How come we ain't gettin' no higher? (How come, how come)

[Verse 1]
Now tell me your philosophy
On exactly what an artist should be
Should they be someone with prosperity
And no concept of reality?
Now, who you know without any flaws?
That lives above the spiritual laws?
And does anything they feel just because (Just because, just because)
There's always someone there who'll applaud?

[Chorus]
C'mon baby light my fire (Come on)
Everything you drop is so tired (Everything you drop is so tired)
Music is supposed to inspire (What are we here for, what are we here for)
How come we ain't gettin' no higher? (Gettin' no higher)

[Verse 2]
I know you think that you've got it all
And by making other people feel small
Makes you think you're unable to fall
But when you do, who you gonna call?
See what you give is just what you get (What you give is just what you get)
I know it hasn't hit you yet (I know it hasn't hit you yet)
Now I don't mean to get you upset (Get upset, get upset)
But every cause has an effect, uh-huh!

[Chorus]
C'mon baby light my fire
Everything you drop is so tired (Yeah)
Music is supposed to inspire (Music is supposed to inspire)
How come we ain't gettin' no higher? (We ain't no higher, we ain't no higher)

[Verse 3]
I cross sands in distant lands, made plans with the sheiks
Why you beef with freaks as my album sales peak? Uhh
All I wanted was to sell like five hundred
And be a ghetto superstar since my first album, Blunted
I used to work at Foot Locker, they fired me: I fronted
Or I quitted, now I spit it, however do you want it?
Now you get it!
Writing rhymes, in the Range, with the frames lightly tinted
Then send it to your block and have my full name cemented (Lauryn Hill!)
And if your lines sound like mine I'm taking a percentage (ka-ching!)
Unprecedented, and still respected when it's vintage
I'm serious, I'm takin' over areas in Aquarius
Runnin' red lights with my ten thousand chariots
Just as Christ was a Superstar, you stupid, star!
They'll hail you then nail you, no matter who you are
They'll make you now then take you down, and make you face it
If you slit the bag open, put your pinky in it and taste it

[Chorus]
C'mon baby light my fire
Everything you drop is so tired (Everything you drop, everything you drop)
Music is supposed to inspire (Oh yeah)
How come we ain't gettin no higher? (We ain't getting no higher, getting no higher)
C'mon baby light my fire (C'mon baby light my fire)
Everything you drop is so tired (Everything you drop is so tired)
Music is supposed to inspire
How come we ain't gettin no higher? (How come we ain't gettin no higher?)
C'mon baby light my fire (Come on baby)
Everything you drop is so tired (Everything you drop is so tired)
Music is supposed to inspire
How come we ain't gettin no higher? (We ain't no higher)

[Chorus]
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch (heaven to touch)
I wanna hold you so much (hold you so much)
At long last, love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

[Verse]
Pardon the way that I stare (the way that I stare)
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak (words left to speak)
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you, baby, and if it's quite alright
I need you, baby, to warm a lonely night
I love you, baby, trust in me when I say, "It's okay"
Oh, pretty baby, don't let me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, oh, baby—let me love you, oh, baby—

[Chorus]
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you (eyes off of you)
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much (hold you so much)
At long last, love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you, baby, and if it's quite all right
I need you, baby, to warm a lonely night
I love you, baby, trust in me when I say, "It's okay"
Oh, pretty baby, don't let me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, oh, baby—let me love you, oh, baby
I need you, baby, and if it's quite all right
I need you, baby, to warm a lonely night
I love you, baby, trust in me when I say, "It's okay"
Oh, pretty baby, don't let me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, oh, baby—let me love you, oh, baby

[Intro]
Yo, he-he, tell him um, (Huuu)
It's like, uhh, you know, uhh
Sweet, sweet, sweet
Tell him
Uhh
Mmm-m-m-m

[Verse 1]
Let me be patient, let me be kind
Make me unselfish without being blind
Though I may suffer, I'll envy it not
And endure what comes (Daah)
'Cause he's all that I got (Uuu) tell him (Aha)

[Refrain]
Tell him I need him (Yeah)
Tell him I love him (Tell him who it hit)
And it'll be alright (It'll be alright)
And tell him (Tell him)
Tell him I need him (Be alright)
Tell him I love him (Tell him I love him)
It'll be alright (Be alright)

[Verse 2]
Now I may have faith (I may have faith) to make mountains fall
(To make mountains fall)
But if I lack love, then I am nothin' at all
I can give away (I can give away) everything I possess
But left without love then I have no happiness
I know I'm imperfect (I know I'm imperfect), and not without sin
(Not without sin, nah)
But now that I'm older, all childish things end (Ohh)
And tell him (Tell him)

[Refrain]
Tell him I need him (Tell him I need him)
Tell him I love him (Ha-ah)
And it'll be alright (It'll be alright)
Tell him (Tell him)
Tell him I need him (Tell him)
Tell him I love him (Tell him) (Be alright)
It'll be alright (Be alright)
Oh, yeah

[Bridge]
I'll never be jealous (I'll never be jealous)
And I won't be too proud (Houu)
'Cause love is not boastful (Noo)
Oooh and love is not loud
Tell him I need him (Tell him I need him)
Tell him I love him (Tell him I love him)
Everything is gonna (Everything), is gonna be (Everything) alright
Ya-eee-ya-eee-ya-eee-ya-eee-ya-eee-ya-eee-ya-eee-ya-eee
Uuu-u-uu (Uuu)
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Uuu-u-uu (Uuu)
Ah-ah-ah

[Verse 3]
Now I may have wisdom (I may have wisdom)
And knowledge on Earth
But if I speak wrong, ooh, then what is it worth? (What is it worth?)
See what we now know is nothing compared
To the love that was shown when our lives were spared (Uuh)
And tell him (Tell him)

[Refrain]
Tell him I need him (Tell him I need him)

Oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah (I need you)
When the, when the evening comes, oh
In the night time
In the morning
In the evening baby tell him
Tell him

[Verse 1]
My world, it moves so fast today
The past, it seems so far away
And life squeezes so tight that I can't breathe
And every time I've tried to be what someone else has thought of me
So caught up, I wasn't able to achieve

[Chorus]
But deep in my heart, the answer, it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny

[Verse 2]
I look at my environment
And wonder where the fire went
What happened to everything we used to be
I hear so many cry for help
Searching outside of themselves
Now I know that His strength is within me

[Chorus]
And deep in my heart, the answer, it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny (And deep in my heart)
And deep in my heart, the answer, it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny

[Hook]
I get out, I'll get out of all your boxes
I get out, you can't hold me in these chains
I'll get out, Father free me from this bondage
Knowin' my condition is the reason I must change

[Verse 1]
Your stinking resolution is no type of solution
Preventing me from freedom, maintaining your pollution
I won't support your lie no more
I won't even try no more
If I have to die, oh Lord, that's how I choose to live
I won't be compromised no more
I can't be victimized no more
I just don't sympathize no more, ‘cause now I understand
You just wanna use me
You say "love" then abuse me
You never thought you'd lose me
But how quickly we forget that nothin' is for certain
You thought I'd stay here hurtin'
Your guilt trip's just not workin', repressin' me to death
‘Cause now I'm choosin' life, yo
I'll take the sacrifice, yo
If everything must go, then go: that's how I choose to live

[Interlude]
Heh… hehehehehe…
Ok, we gettin' there
At least I had a chunk
Aight, okay, it's how I choose to live
Hehehe, awww

[Verse 2]
No more compromises
I see past your disguises
Blinding me through mind control
Stealing my eternal soul
Appealing through material
To keep me as your slave

[Hook]
But I get out, oh, I get out of all your boxes
I'll get out, oh, you can't hold me in these chains
I get out, oh, I want out of social bondage
Knowin' my condition, oh, is the reason I must change

[Verse 3]
See, what you see is what you get
Oh, and you ain't seen nothin' yet
Oh, I don't care if you're upset
I could care less if you're upset
See, it don't change the truth
And your hurt feeling's no excuse
To keep me in this box, psychological locks
Repressin' true expression
Cementin' this repression
Promotin' mass deception
So that no one can be healed
I don't respect your system
I won't protect your system
When you talk I don't listen
Oh, let my Father's will be done

[Hook]
And just get out, oh, just get out of all these bondage
Just get out, oh, you can't hold me in these chains
Just get out, all these traditions killin' freedom
Knowin' my condition is the reason I must change

[Verse 4]
I've just accepted what you said
Keeping me among the dead
The only way to know is to walk to learn and grow
But faith is not your speed
Oh, you’d have everyone believe
That you're the sole authority
Just follow the majority
Afraid to face reality—the system is a joke
Oh, you'd be smart to save your soul
Oh, and escape this mind control
You spent your life in sacrifice to a system for the dead
Oh, are you sure, where is the passion in this living?
Are you sure it's God you serving?
Obligated to a system
Getting less then you're deserving
Who made up these schools, I say
Who made up these rules, I say
Animal conditioning, oh, just to keep us as a slave

[Hook]
Oh, just get out of this social purgatory
Just get out, all these traditions are a lie
Just get out, superstition killin' freedom
Knowin' my condition is the reason I must die, ahh

[Outro]
Just get out, just get out, just get out
Let's get out, let's get out
Knowin' my condition
Is the reason I must die, just get out

[Verse]
The conquering lion
Shall break every chain
The conquering lion
Shall break every chain
Give him the victory
Again and again and again and again
Give him the victory
Ohh

The conquering lion
Shall break every chain
The conquering lion
Shall break every chain
Give him victory
Again and again and again and again and again and again
Give us some victory
Ohh, yeah
Ohh, conquering lion

Shall break every chain, every chain, every chain
The conquering lion, yeah ohh
Shall break every chain
Give us some victory
We need some victory
We need some victory
Again and again and again and again
Give, give, give, us some victory
Ohh, ohh, ohh
The conquering lion
He'll break every chain
Every one of your chains, every one of your chains
The conquering lion
Hey, he's gonna break all of those chains if you just let him
Give him, give him the victory, give him the victory
Again and again and again and again
Give him the victory
Ohh, ohh, ohh

[Verse 1]
I find it hard to say
That everything is alright
Don't look at me that way
Like everything is alright
'Cause my own eyes can see
Through all your false pretenses
But what you fail to see
Is all the consequences
You think our lives are cheap
And easy to be wasted
As history repeats
So foul you can taste it

[Refrain]
And while the people sleep
Too comfortable to face it
His life's so incomplete
And nothing can replace it
And while the people sleep
Too comfortable to face it
Your life's so incomplete
And nothing can replace it

[Verse 2]
Fret not thyself I say
Against these laws of man
'Cause like the Bible says:
His blood is on their hands

[Chorus]
And what I gotta say
And what I gotta say, is rebel
While today is still today, choose well
And what I gotta say, is rebel
It can't go down this way
Choose well, choose well, choose well
Choose well, choose well, choose well

[Refrain]
And while the people sleep
Too comfortable to face it
Your lives are so incomplete
And nothing, and no one, can replace it
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Chorus]
And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say
And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say
And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say
And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say
Is rebel – rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel
Rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel
Repent, the day is far too spent – rebel, rebel!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up and rebel
We must destroy in order to rebuild
Wake up, you might as well
Oh are you… oh are you satisfied?
Oh are you satisfied? Rebel, ohhh, rebel!

[Outro]
Why don't you rebel?
Why don't you rebel?
Why don't you rebel?
I'm fading myself down now

[Hook]
Everybody knows that they guilty
Everybody knows that they've lied
Everybody knows that they guilty
Resting on their conscience eating their inside
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
Time to get free, or give yourselves up now
It's freedom, said it's freedom time

[Verse]
Yo, there's a war in the mind, over territory
For the dominion
Who will dominate the opinion
Skisms and isms, keepin' us in forms of religion
Conformin' our vision
To the world church's decision
Trapped in a section
Submitted to committee election
Moral infection
Epidemic lies and deception
Insurrection
Of the highest possible order
Destortin' our tape recorders
From hearin' like under water
Beyond the borders
Find the sin in disorder
Bound by the strategy
A systematic depravity
Heavy as gravity
Head first in the cavity
Without a bottom
A fate, worse than Sodom
What's got 'em, drunk off the spirits
Truth comes, we can't hear it
When you've been, programmed to fear it
I had a vision I was fallin' in indescision
Apallin', callin' religious
Some program on television
How can, dominant wisdom
Be recognized in the system
Of Anti-Christ, the majority rules
Intelligent fools
PhDs in illusion
Masters of mass confusion
Bachelors in past delusion
Now who you choosin'?
The head, or the tail
The bloodshed of the male
Or confidence in the tale
Conferences is Yale
Discussin' doctrines of Baal
Causin' people to fail
Keepin' the third in jail
His word has nailed
Everything to the tree
Severing all of me
From all that I used to be
Formless and void
Totally paranoid
Enjoy darkness as Lord
Keepin' me from the sword
Block for mercy
Bitter than cerasee
Hungry and thirsty
For good meat we would eat
And still, dined at the table of deceit
How incomplete
From confrontation to retreat
We belong, in true enemies defeat
Destitute in a necessity
Causin' desperation to get the best of me
Punishment 'til there was nothing left of me
Realizin' the inescapable death of me
No options in the valley of decision
The only doctrine, supernatural circumcision
Inwardly, only water can purge the heart
From words to fiery darts
Thrown by the workers of the arts
Iniquity, shapen in
There's no escapin' when
Your whole philosophy is paper thin
In vanity
The wide road is insanity
Could it be all of humanity
Picture that
Scripture that
The origin of a man's heart is black
How can we show up for
An invisible war
Preoccupied with a shadow, makin' love with a whore
Achin' in sores
Babylon, the great mystery
Mother of human history
System of social sorcery
Our present condition
Needs serious recognition
Where there's no repentance there can be no admission
And that sentence, more serious than Vietnam
The atom bomb and Saddam and Minister Farrakhan
What's goin' on, what's a priority to you
By what authority do to you
The majority hasn't a clue
We majored in curses
Search the chapters, check the verses
Recapture the land
Remove the mark from off of our hands
So we can stand
In agreement with his command
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand
Everything else is damned, let them with ears understand

[Hook]
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
It's freedom, I'mma be who I am
It's freedom time, said it's freedom time
Everybody knows that they've lied
Everybody knows that they've perpetrated inside
Everybody knows that they guilty, yes
Resting on their conscience eating their insides
Get free, be who you're supposed to be
Freedom, said it's freedom time now
Freedom, said it's freedom time
Freedom, freedom time now

[Verse 1]
See, the road to hell is paved with good intentions
Can't you tell, the way they have to mention
How they helped you out?
You're such a hopeless victim!
Please don't do me any favors, Mr. Intentional

[Verse 2]
All their talk is seasoned to perfection
The road they walk, commanding your affection
They need to be needed, deceived by motivation
An opportunity to further situation
Why they're so important is without explanation
Please don't patronize me, Mr. Intentional

[Verse 3]
We give rise to ego by being insecure
The advice that we go desperately searching for
The subconscious effort to support our paramour
To engage in denial, to admit we're immature
Validating lies, Mr. Intentional
Open up yours eyes, Mr. Intentional

[Verse 4]
Stuck in a system that seeks to suck your blood
Held emotionally hostage by what everybody does
Counting all the money that you give them just because
Exploiting ignorance in the name of love
Stop before you drop because that's just the way it was
Please don't justify me, Mr. Intentional
Oh one-dimensional, Mr. Intentional
Oh don't you do me any favors

[Verse 5]
Wake up, you've been sleeping
Take up your bed and walk
Stop blaming other people
Oh it's nobody else's fault
Accept the truth about you
You know that life goes on without you
And your expensive misinventions
Disguising your intentions
Don't worship my hurt feelings, Mr. Intentional

[Verse 6]
See, I know you can't help me, Mr. Intentional
The only help I need to live is unprofessional
The only wealth I have to give is not material
And if you need much more than that, I'm not available
Please don't entertain me, Mr. Intentional
Oh I don't need your sympathy, Mr. Intentional
Stay away from me, Mr. Intentional
So one-dimensional, Mr. Promotional
Mr. Emotional, Mr. Intentional

[Intro]
Ohh, this feel good, alright, Ye
Carter Trey, all day, let's play, haha

[Chorus]
Okay
I know two girls that done did it before
But I wonder if they know that we did it before
If the other girl know that we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it before

[Verse 1]
Okay, put your hands up if you did it before
Now your girl lookin' at you cause she didn't hell know
And now everybody sayin' that you did it before
And you know that's because they probably did it before
Cause if they did it before it would be different though
I wonder if Tammy knows, that I did it before
With Nisa, I wonder if she didn't hell know
That we did it before I know they did it before
The day we did it but oh, if they did it before
And we did it before, we can get it fa' sho
Cause if she with it, I know she should be with it fa' sho
I'm a tear that pussy up, like I didn't before
And after I did it they be history though
When I see em I act like I didn't hell know
That we did it before like we didn't before
But we did it before, hehe

[Chorus]
Okay
I know two girls that done did it before
But I wonder if they know that we did it before
If the other girl know that we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it before

[Verse 2]
Yeah, so if you did it before, be a pro
You gotta act like you didn't before
And everytime I meet a girl
They say that she didn't before
You know I gotta act like I never did it before
But she would be dumb if she didn't hell know
Cause I did it before and she will be dumb
If she think that I didn't, hell know
That she did it before, she probablly didn't go low
So we did it some more and we did it some more
Like Busta Rhymes said, she holla "give me some more"
So we did it some more, yeah, we did it til' four
And when four-o-one came, she was hittin the door
Not fixin' to go but she was hittin' the door
And I was probably butt naked just twistin' an O
Then I call my homies up, kick the shit how it go
And I know they gon' laugh cause they did it before

[Chorus]
Okay
I know two girls that done did it before
But I wonder if they know that we did it before
If the other girl know that we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it before

[Verse 3]
Okay, a lot of folks don't like to say they did it before
Wishin' that everybody didn't hell know
That they did it before, like if they did it'd be low
Or if they did it with more, than one, or did it for dough
Well if you didn't, then so, be cool with it and flow
And just rock with everybody, that done did it before
I know I did it before, you know you did it before
How come you ain't with it now, but you was with it before
Oh, that's your best friend, yeah, ya'll kick it I know
Ya'll probablly did it before, she probably licked it before
Like it was liquid before, yeah, I can vision you both
Like I done did it before cause I done did it before

[Chorus]
Okay
I know two girls that done did it before
But I wonder if they know that we did it before
If the other girl know that we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it before

[Verse 1]
Adam lives in theory
Trying to turn stone into bread
Masquerading like he got it figured out
Cut off from the sunshine, only smart in his own head
Leaving his descendants to hope and doubt
Left to his devices, those worthless sacrifices
Praying to the altar of himself
Making pilgrimages, thinking he's religious
Like he's got all the light, and no one else
He takes the unsuspected
Cause he knows they're not connected
And he shows them how to be just as he is
Virtually real, and commercially appealed
To the lust of all the people where he lives
Eve was so naive, blinded by the pride and greed
Wanting to be intellectual
Drifting from the way she got turned down one day
And now she thinks that she's bisexual
Caught up in emotion
Burning up in her devotion
To the king of exploitation in the field
She handed him her virtue
Cause he told her "I won't hurt you"
So she lay with him to see how good it feels

[Hook]
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now?
Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now?
Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?

[Verse 2]
Now after the sensation, and the empty fornication
She brought affection home
Into her bed, quickly multiplying
Now the 3 of them are dying by the poison she perceived to be good (head!)
Now Eve and her husband are perverted in their judgment
Cause everything appears to be the same
They entertain suggestion
Next time just use protection
Desiring to cover up their shame
But much to their demise, poor decision closed their eyes
To the very antidote to their dilemma
Burning in their lust
Both of them adulterous
Destroying the original agenda
Praying to the sky, in order to maintain a lie
They exhausted every possible conclusion
They can't even entertain the solution
In a brain filled with vain information and pollution
Hiding from the truth
He provided an excuse to explain away his desperate situation
When confronted, blamed his wife
Giving birth to carnal life
Refusing to acknowledge what he done
Now if we can agree with who created us to be
Who says we're guilty everyone before his eyes
Making no exceptions, since the day of our conception
Predisposed to hating truth, and loving lies

[Hook]
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now?
Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now?
Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?

[Verse 3]
Stop walking in pride, let the thief be crucified
Un-learn everything you know, and let Him teach you
Line upon line, and precept upon precept, say goodbye
To this decaying social system
He wants to know how far we're willing to go
If we love him like we say we do
He will try us
Just you don't regress
Or slip into hopelessness
Once He's satisfied His love
He won't deny us

[Hook - Shift]
And then He'll tell us, what, what we gonna do now?
Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?
And then He'll tell us, what, what we gonna do now?
Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?

[Verse 1]
I remember
When you look into my eyes
You saw right through me
And I could not hide
I was exposed
Just like a child
All of my heart
You hold it in your hands
I'm yours to command
I'm yours to demand
I, I feel so humble
With you in my life
With you in my life

[Verse 2]
I remember
When I looked into your eyes
I saw a reflection of myself
And I could not lie
Out of control
Too weak to deny
All of myself
Is naked before you
But what can I do
There is nothing I can do
I feel so beautiful
With you in my life
With you in my life

[Outro]
I remember
I remember
I remember
I, ohh, ohh, ohh
With you in my life
With you in my life

[Intro]
Oh Jerusalem
Oh Jerusalem
Oh Jerusalem
Oh Jerusalem

[Verse 1]
Realizing that there's no place else to go
And there's nobody I know who can help me
Textbook solutions are so improbable
Cause everybody else is just as empty

Naked as the day that I was born, I tried to hide
Behind education and philosophy
Hopeless explanation to describe a situation
I can't see because the world's on top of me

[Verse 2]
Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me
From the body of this death?
Freeing me from dust, and the superficial trust
Of an enemy that seeks to take my breath
Failing to connect cause I'm morally defect
By reason of the God inside my head
Causing me to see only what pertains to me
Believing I'm alive when I'm still dead

[Verse 3]
Limited to earth, unable to find out my worth
Cause I can't see past my own vanity
If I'm not included, then I just have to remove it
From my mind because it has to be insanity

Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me
From the body of this death?

[Verse 4]
Can I even factor, that I've only been an actor
In this staged interpretation of this day
Focused on the shadow, with my back turned to the light
Too intelligent to see it's me in the way

What a paradox, having God trapped in a box
All this time professing to be spiritual
Naturally pretending, that I'm actually defending
God through my facade, don't need material

[Hook]
Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee?
Oh Jerusalem, keeping thee from perfection

[Verse 5]
Submit to truth, leave the deception of thy youth
So we could walk in the council of authority
Forget the proof, our generation so aloof
Only follow in the steps of the majority

Trust in the Lord with all thy heart
And lay not to thine, oh an understanding in all thy ways
Acknowledge Him, and He shall direct our paths
Be not wise in thine own eyes and you can follow him

We judge and condemn, just as ignorant as them
Who religion tells us that we should ignore
Perpetrating we're in covenant with Him
Exposed by the very things that we adore

[Verse 6]
We grin and shake hands, then lay ambush for the man
Who has a different point of view then us
Infuriated cause he doesn't understand
Bringing up those things we don't want to discuss

Why still do evil, we don't know how to do good
Walking on in darkness running from the light
Led to believe, because we live in neighborhoods
Telling us what's going on will be alright
Oh so repressed, so convinced that I was blessed
When I played with my game of Monopoly
Oh to suggest, that my life is still a mess
Who reveal the pride I'm hiding is what's stopping me

[Hook]
Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee?
Oh Jerusalem, keeping thee from perfection

[Verse 7]
Abide in me and I in you, as the branch cannot bear
Fruit of itself except in the vine
I am the vine, ye are the branches, he that lives in me
And I in him, the same bring forth much fruit

Without me, you can do nothing
Oh Jerusalem, you're traditions have deceived you
I've chosen you, you haven't chosen me
Do whatsoever, you asking my name he may give to you

But in vain they call my name
Teaching doctrines just the same
Justified among themselves
But God know with the heart, what man esteemed as smart
Is an abomination to Emmanuel

[Verse 8]
Just repent, turn from selfish motivation
So iniquity will not cause your demise
Make you a new heart and a new spirit
For why would he die? Oh Jerusalem, please tell me why

I have no pleasure in the death of him to die
Says the Lord God where forth turn yourselves and live
It's not the talkers, but the walkers and His Word
Are the only ones the Father will forgive

[Hook]
Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee?
Oh Jerusalem, keeping thee from perfection

[Outro]
Oh Jerusalem

[Spoken Intro]

[Verse 1]
Moving down the streams of my lifetime
Pulls the fascination in my sleeve
Cooling off the fire of my longing
Boiling off my cold within his heat
Melting down the walls of inhibition
Evaporating all of my fears
Baptizing me into complete submission
Dissolving my condition with his tears

[Hook]
He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years

[Verse 2]
Coursing through my senses, he's prevailing
Floating through the space of my design
Drowning me to find my inside sailing
Drinking in the mainstream of mind
Filling up the cup of my emotions
Spilling over into all I do
If I only I could get lost in his ocean
Surviving on the thought of loving you

[Hook]
He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
He's just like the water, the water
I ain't felt this way in years

[Verse 3]
Bathing in the fountain of his essence
He causes my expression to remain
Humbled on a mountain by his presence
Washing my intentions with his name
Sealing off the floodgates of his passions
Saving all his liquid for his own
Moisturizing me to satisfaction
In my imagination? No no!
He's pouring out his soul to me for hours and hours
Drawing out my nature with his hands
Yearning I'm so thirsty for his power
Burning to be worthy of his land

[Hook]
He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years

[Bridge]
Cleaning me
He's purging me
And moving me around
He's bathing me
And he's claiming me
And moving me around
Around and around and around
And around
Watching me, claiming me
Moving me around
He's purging me
He's been cleaning me
And moving me around
And around
And around
Around
Around
Moving me around

[Spoken Outro]

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yey
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, Why, heh

[Hook]
They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say
They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say

[Verse 1]
I'll never forget no way, how they crucified Jesus Christ
I'll never forget no way, how they sold Marcus Garvey for rice
I'll never forget no way, how they turned their backs on Paul Bogle
So don't you forget no way...
Who you are, and where you stand in the struggle

[Hook]
They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say
They've got so very many things, to say right now
They've got so much things to say

[Verse 2]
And I don't come to fight flesh and blood
But spiritual wickedness in high and low places
And don't you fight me down
I'll stand firm, and give Jah all the thanks and praises
I don't expect to be justified, by these laws of men
Though the wicked find me guilty, Jah will proove my innocency
'Cause when the rain falls, it don't, fall on one man's house top
Remember that
See when this rain falls, it don't, fall on one man's house top

[Hook]
They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much, so much things to say
They've got, heh, so much things to say right now
They've got so, so much things to say

[Verse 3]
But let them keep talking, oh let them keep talking
'Cause non of them walking, oh non of them walking, no
And while they still talking, see I'mma be walking
I'mma be walking, so let them keep talking

[Verse 1 Reprise]
Said I never forget no way, how they crucified Jesus Christ
And I, I'll never forget, how they sold Marcus Garvey for rice
Said I, never forget, how they turned their backs on Paul Bogle
So non of you, non of you forget...
Who you are, and where you stand in the struggle

[Verse 2 Reprise]
'Cause when this rain, 'cause when this rain, rain, rain, rain, rain falls
It don't fall on one man's house, I'm telling you the rain...
I'm telling you the rain, rain, rain, rain, rain don't fall
It don't fall... they...

[Hook + Outro]
They've got, they've got, so very many things to say about me
I'm telling you lie
They, and they, and they will have so many things
They'll have so many things to say about you...
To say about you
'Cause they don't know me, know me
They don't know me, oh they don't know me, oh they don't know me
Oh they don't know me well
They, they, they, they, they, they, they don't know my Father
'Cause if they did, if they did... hey ey... theeey...
Heh..

[Chorus]
It's the mystery of iniquity
Said it's the misery of Inequity
Said it's the history of Inequity
When it all, all falls down
Telling you all, it all falls down

[Pre-Verse]
Children, eat your bread
Little children, eat your bread
'Cause it all, all falls down
Telling you all, it all falls down

[Verse]
Yo! Y'all can't handle the truth in a courtroom of lies
Perjures the jurors, witness despised
Crooked lawyers, false indictments publicized
It's entertainment, the arraignments, the subpoenas
High profile gladiators in bloodthirsty arenas
Enter the Dragon, black-robe crooked-balance
Souls bought and sold and paroled for thirty talents
Court reporter catch the circus on the paper
File it in the system not acknowledged by the Maker
Swearing by the bible blatantly blasphemous
Publicly perpetrating that "In God We Trust"
Cross-examined by a master manipulator
The faster intimidator receiving the judge's favor
Deceiving sabers doing injury to their neighbors
For status, gratis, apparatus and legal waivers
See the bailiff representing security
Holding the word of God soliciting perjury
The prosecution, political prostitution
The more money you pay, the further away solution
Legal actors, Babylon's benefactors
Masquerading as the agency for the clients
Hypocritical giants, morally non-compliant
Orally armed to do bodily harm
Polluted, recruited and suited judicial charm
And the defense isn't making any sense
Faking the confidence of escaping the consequence
That a defendant is depending on the system
Totally void of judgment purposely made to twist 'em
Emotional victim blackmailed by the henchmen
Framed by intentions
Inventions whereby they lynch men
Enter the false witness slandering the accused
Planting the seed openly showing he's being used
To discredit, edit, headed for the alleged
Smearing the individual fearing the unsuspected
Expert witness (the paid authority)
Made a priority to deceive the majority
Of disinterested peers, dodging duty for years
Hating the process, waiting to be returning to their careers
Do we expect the system made for the elect
To possibly judge correct? Properly serve and protect?
Materially corrupt, spiritually amuck
Oblivious to the cause, prosperously bankrupt
Blind leading the blind, guilty never defined
Filthy as swine, a generation purin it's own mind
Legal extortion, blown out of proportion
In vein deceit, the truth is obsolete
Only two positions: victimizer or victim
Both end up in destruction trusting this crooked system
Mafia with diplomas keeping us in a coma
Trying to own a piece of the "American Corona"
The Revolving Door, insanity every floor
Skyscraping, paper chasing, what are we working for?
Empty traditions, reaching social positions
Teaching ambition to support the family superstition?
When the Son of Perdition is Commander in Chief
The standard is Thief; brethren, can we candidly speak?
Woe to the men, trusted in the chariots dem'
Leaning on horses, they run their intellectual sources
Counterfeit wisdom creating the illusion of freedom
Confusion consumes them
Every word they speak it turns them outwardly white
Internally they absent of light
Trapped in the night and bonded to the Cain of the night
Under the curse, evil men waxing more worse
Faxing the first, angelic being cast to the earth
It's time for rebirth, burnin up the branch and the root
The empty pursuits of every tree bearing the wrong fruit
Turn and be healed, let him who stole, no longer steal
Oh it's real, surrender for Jehovah is real
How long will you sleep, troubled by the thoughts that YOU keep
The idols YOU heap, causing the destruction you reap
Judgment has come, find it and return to the One
Abandon the flesh, self-interest: Broadway to death
Pride and the Greed, hide and subdividing the seed
The knowledge of Good and Evil is what caused us to lie
Caused us to die, let your emotions be crucified
Renounce all your thoughts
Repent and let your mind be re-taught
You'll find what you sought
Was based on the deception you bought
A perception of naught where the majority remains caught
Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die
Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die
Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die
Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die

[Chorus]
It's the mystery of iniquity
Said it's the history of Inequity
Said it's the misery of Inequity
When it all, all falls down, yeah
I'm telling you all, it all falls down

[Intro]
I just want you around
I just want you around
I just want you around
I just want you around

[Verse 1]
Thought that I had lost you
I can hardly make a sound
When I thought I couldn't hold you
Knew the world had let me down
Should have took the time to tell you
You keep my feet on the ground
I hope that you can hear me
Cause I know its not profound

[Hook]
I just want you around
I just need you around
I just want you around
I just need you around

[Verse 2]
When I thought I was without you
I got used to being down
It was my fault I used to doubt you
But that ain't me next time around
Please believe me when I tell you
Cause all my words are bound
This is my cross now let me bare it
I was lost but now I'm found-found-found

[Hook]
I just want you around
I just need you around
I just want you around
I just need you around

[Verse 3]
Took this love for granted
Kept my feelings underground
Should have watered what I planted
Should have known what I have found
I'm not used to being lonely
I don't like the way it sounds
You're the only one I know-yeah
Who don't turn my upside-down

[Hook]
I just want you around
I just need you around
I just want you around
I just need you around
That's right
Um, I wouldn't care if you was a prostitute
And that you hit every man that you ever knew
See it, wouldn't make a difference if that was way before me and you, girl
And you won't never have to worry about me, as long as you keep it real
Whatever's on your mind, speak on how you feel and
Stay truthful to me and never lie to me
And don't you ever keep no secrets, no matter...
Know what I mean... yeah
Well if you don't then I'll explain

[Verse 1]
Listen
I wouldn't care if you was a prostitute
And that you hit every man that you ever knew
See it, wouldn't make a difference if that was way before me and you girl
And you won't never have to worry about me, long as you keep it real
Whatever's on your mind, speak on how you feel
Stay truthful to me and never lie to me
And don't you ever keep no secrets, no matter whatever
You know what I mean yeah
Well if you don't then I'll explain
You could be Mrs. Wayne
And we could do the damn thang
Had to tell my brother Maine I met a girl like you
And I ain't never met another girl like you
But I know what to do with a girl like you, I do
I wouldn't care if you was a prostitute
And hit every man that you ever knew
See it, wouldn't make a difference if that was way before me and you girl
And you won't never have to worry about me, long as you keep it real
Whatever's on your mind, speak on how you feel
And stay true for me and never lie to me
And don't you ever keep no secrets, no matter whatever
You know what I mean yeah
Well if you don't then I'll explain
See I'd give up the game
At the top of the arena there's a jersey with my name, baby
What's happening baby? What's happening baby?
I know you need to roll with a champion baby
And every time I see you I get asthma baby
Like *exhales* that's my baby

I wouldn't care if you was a prostitute
And that you hit every man that you ever knew
See it, wouldn't make a difference if that was way before me and you girl
And you won't never have to worry about me, long as you keep it real
Whatever's on your mind, speak on how you feel
And stay true for me and never lie to me
And don't you ever keep no secrets, no matter whatever
You know what I mean yeah
Uhh, yeah, uhh, yeah-uhh, see cause
I ain't the kind that kiss and tell
But my man say that he really know you well
But I don't care, I wanna know you for my damn self
Yeah, and even though Stunna say you scandalous
And you're known to go from one man to the next
I don't care what he say, no I don't care what he say
Because, they can say what they want girl
But they will never change my views
Cause they would never know you the way that I know you
And I'm trying to share to rest of my whole life with you
And if it gotta be a down, so be it baby
And if your friends can't understand
You don't need 'em baby
You don't need 'em baby
You don't need 'em baby
Don't need 'em
Guitar...

This is the life, nigga, this is the life of a
N.O. nigga, that 5, nigga
That 0, nigga, that 4, nigga

[Verse 1]
The streets make the hustlas
Hustlas make the world go round
The world is made of keys, ounces and pounds
The keys, ounces and pounds is made from hustlas
See how shit come back round for ya
Gotta cop it, chop it and cook it
See how shit come back round for ya
Gotta kick in the oven now watch it bubble
And you can knock on my door
But you can't knock the hustle
But I- it's like a game of twenty-one and I got nineteen
And my J butter put more 'd' on me
Lil Weezy Wee gon eat that's how it is
Got insurance on the floor man I'm that positive
And I'm shaggy in the saggy lens
Me an my squad in the paddy wagon tally Benz
And you know I put the mags on that
.45 mack with the flash on that
Who want it
Everybody sing along

[Hook x2]
Now I'mma ride cuz I got riding in my bloodline
And I'mma shine cuz I got shining in my bloodline
I get that dough cuz I got hustle in my bloodline
I bleed concrete

[Verse 2]
And when I move, I move out with the raw
I move out with the squad
Tools out when we ride we so mob
I throw lives and lowest to live
For my loaf of bread the people's player
I did what the culture said
And I live by La Costra Nostra set
Fuck around I'll knock your shoulder from your head
Get it right I'm a soldier till I'm dead
This kid is white with buttonholes inside that bled
I'm pumping o's with lots of hay
I'm so high and really I don't even know why
And oh I just go buy a whole house
And lay my mat down lay her back down
But I never put my mack down
You see the thug in me
You know Weezy he the young son of Bubba-B
Buy my basketball shorts with a thunder B
If you want it then come to me
I'm right here

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I'm G'd up
Only follow the code of the streets
Live bad to die good
Know how to move when hustling by the days with no food
But just so I can eat
And ain't it a bitch
And if you see me getting fat I'm probably getting rich
And you probably can see me for some crack before six
And after that it's all bricks
A fake and my palm is wrapped around this eight
And my arm because the dirty south is straight Vietnam
I skate with the bomb
I'm asking you don't play with me at all
Shots hit your ass and make three of y'all
It'll take three of y'all to fill one of my shoeprints
Cuz I did and do shit that's better than new shit
Fit for two clips
The kid is a nuisance
Awww man, he's inspired by his own gangsta music
And the Blueprint
Cruising through stoop with the ewe lit
Like ooh shit this is more than weed, it's 500 Degreez

And ooh, I could GPS you—ooh, what you going through?

Okay, ma, the mood is so right
Light two and take flight
My big bro T.I. is the king, I am your prince, your knight, right
You don't need a Superman
You just need a man like Weezy (Baby!)
Haha! And I can make you feel the same way
We can postpone and stay home like a rain-day
"She'll have the salad, just put her on Wayne's plate"
What you know 'bout having syrup poured on that pancake?
Nasty as I wanna be, or nasty as you like me to—
Be; I hope you like me too
But now, you know I like you, too
Three A.M. room service, serve ya
You can be my dessert, be my caramel sherbet
Call your mama, we can make a baby
And the way you work that mic in the video is so (Crazy!)
And that chair or stool move was cool
You make me wanna "ooh!"
But I'ma be cool, I need a moment
I think you are the finest human on earth
We can get together, I can help you with that homework
Take your ass to school, too, boo
Teach you all the rules you never knew
We need a moment
I could be your future, I could be your teacher
Be your professor, write down this lecture
You want some extra credit? Let me check your homework
I could be your tutor and help you with exams
No failing, or it's summertime for you, haha
You got them "Goodies," and I got a sweet tooth
Now, can y'all blame me?
Shit, Hov got Bey
And I just want Ci
See, I just wan' see if you're taller than me
No, really, I want see if you're my "Mrs. Carter"-to-be, haha
Yeah, I know, this is pretty awkward for me
But I just act like you are talking to me when you say...

[Interlude: Ciara]
(Oh!) I mean everything that I say
From the bottom of my heart
I would never, never ever hurt you

[Lil Wayne]
(I open my heart) Believe that, and I agree that
Open up your heart to me and you won't get the key back
Ms. Ciara, you are colder then blue
And baby, I ain't talking to nobody else but (You)

[Refrain: Ciara]
(There's nothing I won't do)
There's nothing I won't do, baby
(To spend my life with you)

So, when I come through the ladies praise me or something
Like, Weezy's the man
If you be's where he be's then you leaves with a tan
Cuz he's 500 Degreez
I need a fan, whew
Cool me off wipe me down
Daddy is back in town
With the back of my Caddy slanted down
And the MAC goes black if you ask around
Put some hash in that grass that you pass around
Then I stash a pound by my ave with rounds
I'm a gangsta until they put my casket down
You can ask around
And they tell you like me
There ain't nobody like me
It's Weezy Baby

[Hook]

[Outro: Lil Wayne]

Slide on them skinnies in the bike with an ill hood
Pipes, rally stripes and fog lights
T-shirt white, three stripes with all ice
What that boy name

Four was mild but five is so wild
I can smoke a green mile
Got a chrome need a Rolls shined up for you baby
Bling-blow, I rock a throwback Jordan 23
Rolling on hot 23's
Tote a big Glock 23
You're looking at the seventeen ward of New Orleans
My block living me
I want you to look hard at some easy money
Stop playing this is Weezy company
Uh-huh

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm the son of Cash Money
The fodd of the squad
And Baby bout to buy me a house in the sky
Cuz I'm so fly
When my feet touch the ground sometimes I gotta ask myself why
Coupe kinda wide but I move sorta quick
Looking for my roof where it went
Mink on the floor big shoes on the bed
Windows are the tint more wood than a bench
Working in the hood more green than the Grinch
Please don't play cuz I'm connected like Sprint
Ladies on the tray popping up the back-end
Peppermint leather with a feather in my brim
It's Lil Weezy
Somethin' on my wrist real breezy
And this is what I say when you see me
Look, and leave your broad at home she get took
Cuz I'm a player hold the game by the book

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Some call me Weezy
But hoes holla look at Lil Wayne
In that booger-green lay like should've been Mace
Sweet, do speak when I should've put trays
Forget it I'mma slam it on bubba-bubba-blaze
So move over what you say shortie
We could do rent pussy
Normally I wouldn't but beating through the Texas
And beating went to the A
Eat with Jazze Pha
But yeah I'm on my way
Cuz I know he got that hay
Hey little mami

You come to my post on the island
Come on that chronic
He-he empty vodka bottles

When I stop rims don't keep spinning they keep shining
Money don't stop keep spinning and keep grinding
Cash Money what you hollering, huh

Ay, let me slide in the Benz with the fished-out fins

Cause you know it ain't trickin if you got it
Copped baby girl what she desired
It's chump change ma, marijuana scholar
Know'n what I got up in my styrofoam cup - that purple stuff
It was given to me at birth to stunt
So that's why I cop the Bentley with the leather and the furry cups

[Baby]
Hey, hold on mami them whips on dubs

Slide in the Benz, fins, bubble-eyed lens
Car show in New York, y'all know who wins

Slippers, white to breate, 500 Degreez

All these, naked women that pop champagne
And these, marble floors stay high as Rick James
If you know my name then you know my game

[Lil Wayne]
It's lil whoadie from the hot block with serious flow
Gotta get dough, cha'll won't feel me broke
But, y'all don't hear me though
Til I'm rolling down my window where my grill is show
And you know I probably pump it through the hood on them 24's

Glock, have ya ribs poking out the side of your shirt
I'm a 17 nigga and I ride through the turf

[Hook: TQ]

[Lil Wayne]
Tats in my face, my back and my arm

[Hook: TQ]
Baby, I'm a stunna

[Outro: Mannie Fresh]
Yo, there it is, ya lil' low life

Oh yeah, believe that

Piece of mind, ya know

My block pumping, and I'm tryna keep that ho pumping

Or his throat from him; these lil niggas? (Pay attention!)
Thinking they fresh—get whipped out your clothes, young'un'

Stop playing, I know what I'm doing, let me get 'em

I don't hate—never, not on my time
I'll put that little red dot on your mind
Talking that crime, but a lot of 'em lying, I'm—
Caught on the grind, never get off my grind, I'm a—
Pimp to these hoes, not a pimp in my mind, nah
And everybody know I'm sharp when I ride
Hop out that new Ferrari with that little horse on the side, yeah
Zoom-zoom, bitch, ride a nigga broom, witch
Half a ki', wet, stinking up your whole room, bitch
Now, break out the perfume, bitch
And niggas come from off that beach, I'm in that water like a cruise ship
Straight up, tell ‘em, I do’s this
One pistol, two clips; I aim at lips
Wayne that shit, shit on y'all
Given to you from the God: I am the God

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne, DJ Drama, & DJ drops]
Yeah, money on my mind, money-money on my mental
Super-super soaker, wet a nigga like a swimsuit
I think they sipping on that "I Can Fuck With Him" juice
Test me if you wanna, bad man, I knock a limb loose
I ain't never scared, I'm protected everywhere
And if a nigga disrespect me, then he shall be buried there
That's my word, got a urge to hit a nigga and swerve
And them birds in the tree get shot down to my feet
It's me, motherfucker, what's better to see?
And when you greedy like me, ain't nothing better than beef
See, I would meet each one of you niggas in the street
Then eat, and pick you little bitches out my teeth
Shout-out to the green and red stitches in my tee, nigga
With no Gucci, I'm a double-G, nigga
My brothers, you have sinned
And the God, I am, amen

[Intro: Lil Wayne, Rick Ross sample, DJ Drama, & DJ tags]

Want it, I'ma bring it—let Diana Ross sing it
I'ma pull it, I'ma bang it—that's that Nina Ross singin'
I be way in Opa-Locka with that Rick Ross bangin'
If you try me, I reverse you—now, you Kris Kross-swingin', yeah
Whip soft, top seats soft—let her feet prop
Heat cocked; something on my neck—look like a peacock
You need not talk that street hop to me, akh'
'Cause we pop, like thousand-dollar bottles of that Cris' Rock
Bitch, stop trippin': I been hot—when not?

Bitch, I bet I'm hustlin' when your nigga not (Every day, I'm hustlin'— E—Every day, I'm hustl'—)

Racetrack jacket with the racetrack Locs, yeah
All-black Maserati—taste that smoke (Gangsta!)
I'ma crack that egg open, beat that yolk
Let it soak, let it soak; watch it come back bulk—yeah!
Then, I hit the streets up and talk that talk
Let it float, let it float, never come back broke, naw!
Run that shit, I'm Cash Money's bread and butter—no sugar
Bring me all the beef: I'm the motherfucking pressure cooker
Yeah, yeah! I could change the weather for you
Lose your ass—the neighbors tell 'em that they never saw you
Close your mouth—it'd be better for you
All that snitchin', like the cops got a medal for you, ha!
I'm a hustler: got work, hoes, and metal for you (Every day, I'm hustlin'— E—Every day, I'm hustl'—)

And this album's a three permer and a clutch

[Hook]
24/7 (Yes, sir)
I go hard (Go hard, go hard, go hard)
Not here

[Verse 2]
I claim squad game till no more Wayne remain
Bang my thing till no more lane remain
Use the left lane man cook up the cocaine
Dudes a lil game and get her to do brain
That boy Weezy is a bad mother-feezy
Me and Young Jazze at the back of one tweezy
I'm so breezy off the Velvie and the perk
Now I'm getting head on the balcony on Bourbon
Apple and Eagle is the street that I shop
The Birdman my daddy and we fly south
And we don't go to work man we get work out
And the bricks may go as low as ten up in the drought
Niggas is selling and you should be buying
Niggas is telling and you should be dying
Niggas is yelling Cash Money till they kill me
C-M-B, I know you gotta feel me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You know if I'm doing it I'm probably doing it for the block
I'm out here bitch I got this here on lock
Come out here bitch I bet this here gon pop
I got ya slick this my year don't knock
Speakers from the front to the rear gon rock
Wood-grain handles to steer it's all hot
I never drove factory and I don't own stock
I drop that bitch on chrome chops, yeah

[Hook till end]

[Hook]
All my niggas if you with me

Hustlers if you with me

[Verse 1]
Aye (Oh!)
I come and do my thang and hold down my side
Eagle Street man throw my set up high
Weezy we gang call them boys that squad
That squad, squad up! you know
And we get a lot of dough on the strength of me
Get a lotta dro on the strength of Fee
Get a lot of blow
But keep that on the D
D what?...DL! you know
And oh you don't wanna fuck with a nigga
'Cuz a nigga might fuck with the trigger
Leave a nigga on the floor
Truly I don't buck with you nigga
Let my tooly talk, talk to you nigga
Bitch man is an itch to a rich man whoa
'20s on the six with the kicks sitting low
Sticky in my swish man gasoline floor
Fire spit man Weezy is about to blow
Ya know!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Aye (oh!)
Pass the pine to the pimp old juice killer
Catch your eye in one glimpse old school with the
Ass up high the front dip drip bam
Mami like damn, Lil Wayne stop playing
Baby I'm a baller I hustle with my father
It's the Birdman and Birdman Jr
I flip them birds man eighteen grand just order
Eighty-five for half and forty-five for quarter
Yeah! Tity baby put it in the air
I'm jumping out this atmosphere
And I'm jumping in your bitch if she had a player
Jumping in the painted thing on them dang-a-dangs
You see the arm when I pass nigga bang-a-lang
You now I'm armed we can mash man it ain't a thing
You know I'm calm but I'm a gorilla ain't a game
I got a banana clip for all you orangutans
Let's bang!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Aye (oh!)
It's young Weezy can't none see me dawg
I get you done easy with one easy phone call
And the sawed-off make your arms fall off
Like a short sleeved polo, won't bother me no more
Ice like strobe light, look like I'm moving slow mo'
Ferrari look nice on low pro Yokohomas
With '20 inch chromes poking out 'em
Chrissy till the dome tote the ganja
Red-bone in the shower
Hello! Pocahontas give a long stroke poke for hours
Floating vagina hoe, I'mma holla
Sold coke in the '90s,  I'm honest man
Nothing big maybe ounces, grams
But I know how to double, and sometimes it's scams
But I know to hustle, and some Glocks'll jam
But I know how to bust 'em, and some drops'll slam
All alloy buttons that's all stunting
That boy's something
Yeah!

[Hook]

[Intro: Lil Wayne - talking]
I met her when I was young and she was younger
With a body like woman so her age meant nothing
I had to get her number
After how she made them daisy dukes fit her all summer
I'm wishing I could hit her all summer
And all she ever wanted
Was for young Weezy to love her
But all I ever wanted was to cum easy and dump her
But that didn't come easy
'Cuz she ended up being my baby's mother
And then I felt smothered but little did I know
I'd never find the same girl inside another
But I never thought that I'd be looking for her
And I never thought that late at night
When I'm in the mix...laying down with some chick
That suddenly it'll click
How this broad in my drawers dont know shit
Bout what I did 'fore I was big
When's there's a woman with my kid where I should be
She screamed to me (What?)
My love, my patience, my pain (OK)
Nigga please

[Hook]
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)

[Verse One]
I met her after the fame
And she ain't even like me but I got her after the game
Mami was a nice piece, young Cali sweet thang
Made her into wifey and then reality changed
It was going good...I was happy again
But then things got rapidly strange
And it had to be Wayne
She was still a virgin
What more could I ask from a dame
But I was a bastard...I asked for the pain
Now my ass in the rain
And she got a new life...the picture flipped
And none of it includes Weez and all his bullshit (Shit)
And I remember the Bahamas for the weekend
We was freaking in the suite
And she looked sweet enough to beat it up
Till we began to sleep and I
I'm dreaming 'bout the Victoria Secret lingerie
Told me keep it..she ain't want moms to see it
And just think I once saw it on the girl's body
Now all I'm seeing is nobody

[Hook]
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)

[Verse Two]
You see I never really ran, but no gentleman
All I know is big pimpin' ma'am
I'm just tryna be Weezy
And the perfect husband just might be too hard to find in me, Weezy
Baby girl you gotta work with ya boy
'Cuz all of that cursing it be hurting ya boy
Look for the better not the worst in ya boy
And maybe I can be ya boy...Ya know what I'm sayin'
But see this here is not your everyday love tune
It's the story of your everyday thug dude
And in your mind you prolly thinkin we don't love you
But on the real we just not used to what love do
And please consider that
We were taught to love money, ice, cars, and clothes
Love pussy but you dont love them ho's
Love ya niggas love ya children
Now if they got a bitch you could love that
Holla back

[Hook]
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
Young Weez'got the young'n blues y'all
(da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
