t cop if you wanted to
Because something near your leg
Is haunting you, such a disgrace
You're rock hard in a funky place, ow!

[Chorus]
Rock hard in a funky place

[Verse 3]
You was working on the line
You could drop on her
But you couldn't concentrate
When your dick so hard
Maybe if you cop a nut in the car (Maybe if you cop a nut in the car)
Maybe you could think
About playing guitar

[Bridge]
(Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
(Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
Rock hard in a funky place

[Vesre 4]
All you're looking for is love
Or a reason to believe there's a God above
Pretty soon you'll get enough
And head back to a life so tough
I just hate to see an erection go to waste
I'm just-a rock hard in a funky place

[Chorus]
Rock hard in a funky place
Say it
Rock hard in a funky place
Rock hard in a funky place
Oohh for rock hard in a funky place
You rock hard in a funky place
Say it, you'all

[Bridge]
(Rock, rock)
What? (rock, rock, rock, rock)
We got to go, y'all
Tune in next week (rock, rock)
Same time (rock, rock)
Same boogie (rock, rock, rock, rock, rock hard)
Oohhh yeah (rock, rock, rock, rock)
We will rock, y'all (rock, rock)

[Outro]
But until then keep your finger on the trigger
That's the only way it'll get bigger
(What kind of fuck ending was that?)

[Verse 1]
My baby lives in shades of blue
Blue eyes and jazz and attitude
He lives in California, too
He drives a Chevy Malibu
And when he calls, he calls for me and not for you
He lives for love, he loves his drugs, he loves his baby, too

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't fix him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather

[Chorus]
But you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

[Verse 2]
My baby lives in shades of cool
Cold heart and hands and aptitude
He lives for love, for women, too
I'm one of many, Bonnie's blue
And when he calls, he calls for me and not for you
He prays for love, he prays for peace, and maybe someone new

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't help him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather

[Chorus]
'Cause you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

[Bridge]
Your hot, hot weather in the summer
High, high, neglectful lover
Hot, hot weather in the summer
High, neglectful lover
You're crumbling, sadly
You're sadly, crumbling

[Chorus]
You are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

[Outro]
Pa pa da pa
Pa pa da ah, oh
Oh, oh
Oh

[Verse 1]
Why should i feel discouraged?
And why should the shadows fall?
Why should my heart be lonely?
And long for heaven and home
When jesus is my portion
A constant friend is he
His eye is on a spar-a sparrow
And i know he watches, he watching me

[Chorus]
I sing because i'm happy
I sing because i'm free
His eye is on a spar-a sparrow
And i know, and i know

[Verse 2]
Do you know? Do you know?
If you get lonely, do you know?
He watch, he watch you

[Chorus]
I sing because i'm happy
I sing because i'm, i am free
I'm telling you god's eye
His eye is on a sparrow
And i know he will watch
He will watch me
My country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of liberty
Of thee I sing

Land where my fathers died
Land of the pilgrim's pride
From every mountainside

Let freedom ring
Let freedom ring
Let it ring

[Intro: Andy Samberg]
Seems like these days the whole world's on fire
Things keep blowing the hell up
And while all those rubberneckers and looky loos stand slack jawed staring
The real men have the nuts to walk away
Yeah!

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg]
Cool guys don't look at explosions
They blow things up and then walk away
Whose got time to watch an explosion?
There's cool guy errands that they have to walk to

[Chorus: Andy Samberg]
Keep walking, keep shining
Don't look back, keep on walking
Keep strutting, slow motion
The more you ignore it, the cooler you look

[Interlude: Andy Samberg and Will Ferrell]
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming
Mr. Neil Diamond!
Ha ha ha, where are we?

[Verse 2: Will Ferrell]
Cool guys don't look at explosions
They stride forward in their diamond covered boots
They wear jumpsuits of glittery rhinestones
And walk away in slow motion

[Chorus: Andy Samberg and Will Ferrell]
Keep walking, you're cruisin'
"Cherry, Cherry," "Sweet Caroline"
Denzel walks, Will Smith walks
Mark Wahlberg is wearing a hat

[Andy Samberg]
Keyboard solo, J.J Abrams!
(Yeah!)
(Now you're talking!)
(Woo-Hoo!)
(Okay!)

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg and Will Ferrell]
Because cool guys don't look at explosions
The flames are hot but their heart is chill
Walk fast from that boring explosion
And don't think about the people you've killed

[Andy Samberg]
Two, three, four!

[Intro]
Yeah, it's young
Ya know?
Crack that shit down
Roll that shit up
Light that shit
Pass it
Nah, fuck that
Face this one, yeah
This for all my true weed smokers (Yeah)
Nigga ask me what's wrong with me?

[Hook]
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
(That dicky, that icky, that sticky)
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
(That dicky, that icky, that sticky)
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
(That dicky, that icky, that)
Purple, purple in my pocket and my jeans sag low
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
(That dicky, that icky, that sticky)
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
(That dicky, that icky, that sticky)
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
(That dicky, that icky, that)
Purple, purple in my pocket and my jeans sag low

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank, ridin' in my ride
So blowed, don't how to think but I'm stayin' high
I'ma roll me a nice, long Swisher, filled with light green
Oh, I think they like me, let me get a light, B
(And then I'm gone)
Off that Cali bud, what the fuck you chokin' on?
Mr. Blow It by the Zone, O's like Omarion
And we ain't tuckin' nothin' cousin, what's the hold up?
Keep 'em comin' back to back to back, we roll up
('Til it's all gone)
Get a pound, break it down
I ain't stingy, it's enough to go around
And I'm blazin' right now, niggas tellin' me to hold on
Crank it, twist it, light it, take a pull and hold on
(And then I'm gone)
I gotta have it, gotta have it, that's unheard about
Rollin' up another blunt, before I put the first one out
My eyes low, heavy chiefin' 'til I choke
Niggas askin' me what's wrong
Blew some smoke up out my nose and said I'm gone

[Hook]
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
(That dicky, that icky, that sticky)
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
(That dicky, that icky, that sticky)

I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
(That dicky, that icky, that sticky)
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
(That dicky, that icky, that)
Purple, purple in my pocket and my jeans sag low

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I said, I'm gone off that brownish drank, niggas know how I roll
It look like my eyes closed, Hennessy and Hydro, rhyme slow
Nigga, I'm on a different type of a vibe
This a different type of weed and I'm a different type a high
(My nigga, I'm gone)
To a place that you probably never been in life
Smokin' Purple Kryptonite, make sure you curl that Swisher right
Cause I ain't tryna have this home grown runnin'
Homie thinkin' he gon' smoke for free, I duck 'em, roll somethin'
(And then, I'm gone)
In my ride, doin' 80 in a 45 Zone, half a zone
Got me blown, I get more than high
Fresh up off the plane, head straight into my hotel
Weed man in every city, yeah, I smoke well
(Even when I'm gone)
I ain't the only one, all my niggas puff pounds
Swingin' blunts 'round, sun up 'till sun down
My eyes low and my words are getting slow
Niggas askin' me what's wrong
I blew some smoke up out my nose and said I'm gone

[Hook]
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
(That dicky, that icky, that sticky)
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
(That dicky, that icky, that sticky)
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
(That dicky, that icky, that)
Purple, purple in my pocket and my jeans sag low
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
(That dicky, that icky, that sticky)
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
(That dicky, that icky, that sticky)
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
(That dicky, that icky, that)
Purple, purple in my pocket and my jeans sag low

[Chorus]
Every girl wants my guy (My guy)
And I can understand it (They want my guy)
Well, they're never going to get him (My guy)
Why can't they see that the boy loves me?

[Verse 1]
Oh, I'm hot tonight like dynamite
So I know I can keep that man
When it comes to love I'm a cut above
Ooh, any other woman
I'm a rough and tough and ready girl (Ow)
So don't you even try it
He can never find any love like mine
So don't you know you're wasting time?

[Chorus]
Every girl wants my guy (My guy)
And I can understand it (They want my guy)
Well, they're never going to get him (My guy)
Why can't they see that the boy loves me?
Every girl wants my guy (My guy)
Ooh, and I can understand it (They want my guy)
They're never going to get him (My guy)
Why can't they see that the boy loves me?

[Verse 2]
Ooh, when they see my guy walking down the street
The other guys are mesmerized
He's the kind of guy that they want to be
Oh, but they know not to even try
He's a rough and tough and a ready guy (Ow)
So I don't even worry about
Any girl who thinks she can turn his eye
Huh, I feel bad for her when she finds out

[Chorus]
Every girl wants my guy (My guy)
Ooh ooh, and I can understand it (They want my guy)
Well, they're never going to get him (My guy)
Why can't they see that the boy loves me?

[Bridge]
Check it out
Dig on it, dig on it

[Interlude]
Hello? Hey, Kitty Girl - what's happening?
Oh, same old thing, girls trying to jerk me for my man
Mhm, oh yeah, mhm, Miss Thang is really after him
Uh huh, ha ha, yeah, but you know, I'm going for a black out with him
Oh yeah, girl, he's been snatched by me now
We are full sitch, for sure
He is so totally tubular (We want your guy)
Who is...who is that? Who else is on the line?
Kitty, do you have a party line?
Well, let me tell you all something (We want your guy)

[Verse 3]
I'm hot tonight like dynamite
Mmm, so I know I can keep that man
When it comes to love I'm a cut above

[Outro]
And as for you, as for you, Dolly Poo
Don't even worry about it
Have you looked in your mirror lately?
You better dust it off because you are r-u-i-n-t
Ha ha

[Verse 1]
Sunshine, blue skies, please go away
My man has found another and gone astray
With him went my future, my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain

[Chorus]
Ooh yeah, yeah (Rain)
I wish it would rain (Rain)
Oh yes I do

[Verse 2]
Because so badly I, I want to go outside
But I know deep in my heart, that I shouldn't to cry
But I just got to cry, ooh yeah
Because crying eases my pain
To the world outside my tears I refuse to explain
Just wish it would rain

[Bridge]
(Rain, rain)
Uh-huh (Rain, rain)
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
(Rain, rain)
Oh (Oh), so bad (Oh)
So bad (Rain, thunder), thunder
(Uh-huh) Uh-huh, (Uh-huh), Uh-huh
(Uh) Uh, (Uh) Uh, (Uh) Uh, (Uh) Uh
Well, ooh well, oh well, oh well

[Verse 3]
Day in day out my tear-stained face
Stays pressed against the window pain
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain
Because raindrops will hide my teardrops
No one will ever know that I'm crying, crying
This hurt I feel inside, words could never explain
Oh, I wish it would rain

[Outro]
(Rain) I wish it would rain (Rain, rain)
You're walking all over, walking all over my heart, boy
I wish it would rain
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain all over the world, baby
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
All over the world
I just wonder why you wanna be so cold with me, ah baby
Why you, why you, why you wanna be so hard with me? Ooh boy...

[Verse 1]
Why are we fighting?
Why do we scream?
Seems all we do now is treat each other mean
We used to be so understanding (We used to be so understanding)
About each others ways (About our ways)
But since we've come together
Seems all we do is get in each other's way

[Chorus]
We're better friends than lovers (We're so much better friends)
We used to have a ball (We used to have a ball)
Let's not wait until the friendship breaks
We don't have to lose it all
We're better friends than lovers (We're so much better friends)
Honey, can't you see? (Baby, can't you see)
You need you and I need me
So it's time now to set each other free
(It's time to set love free)

[Verse 2]
You get mad when guys stare at me
And I'm mad when girls look
I don't believe we're ready now
For living by this book
The things we love about us (The things we love about us)
Are the things we seem to hate (Nothing but hate)
And when we go out for good times
We just come home with big headaches

[Chorus]
We're better friends than lovers (We're so much better friends)
We used to have a ball (We used to have a ball)
Let's not wait until the friendship breaks
'Cause we don't have to lose it all
We're better friends than lovers (We're so much better friends)
Honey, can't you see? (Baby, can't you see)
You need you and I, I really need me
So it's time now to set each other free
(Hey hey hey, it's time to set love free)

[Bridge]
(You need you, and I need me)
We were both out there fishing (Out there fishing)
We weren't ready to care (We weren't ready to care)
And no room in our hearts for love
To love each other back (Let's get it back)

[Chorus]
We're better friends than lovers (We're so much better friends)
We used to have a ball (We used to have a ball)
Let's not wait until the friendship breaks
'Cause we don't have to lose it all
We're better friends than lovers (We're so much better friends)
Sugar, can't you see? (Baby, can't you see)
You need you and I really need me
So it's time now to set each other free
(It's time to set love free)
We're so much better Friends than lovers (We're so much better friends)
We used to have a ball (We used to have a ball)
Let's not wait until the friendship breaks
We don't have to lose it all
We're better friends than lovers (We're so much better friends)
Baby, can't you see? (Baby, can't you see)
You need you and I really need me
So it's time now to set each other free
(It's time to set love free)
We're so much better friends (We're so much better friends)
We used to have a ball (We used to have a ball)
Let's not wait until the friendship breaks
Well, we don't have to lose it all
We're better friends than lovers (We're so much better friends)

[Chorus]
I got your love
It's all that I got
I got your love
It's all I ever think about
I got your love
Every last drop
I got your love
It's all I ever think about
It's all I ever think about
It's all I ever think about

[Verse 1]
Baby In the heart of my heart I want more
Of the man who just walked through that door
The only one that my eyes see
Baby the moments have drifted away
And the hours became lonely days
You're the answer to what I have prayed
I, I will be good to you
I, I will be good to you

[Chorus]
I got your love
It's all that I got
I got your love
It's all I ever think about
I got your love
Every last drop
I got your love
It's all I ever think about
It's all I ever think about
It's all I ever think about

[Verse 2]
Baby, losing you's all that I fear
And I'm losing it when you're not here
I never could go on without you
Baby, I feel like a shower of light
And I need you right here by my side
I'm craving you all of my life

[Bridge]
I, I will be good to you
I, I will be good to you

[Chorus]
I got your love
It's all that I got
I got your love
It's all I ever think about
I got your love
Every last drop
I got your love
It's all I ever think about
It's all I ever think about
It's all I ever think about
Aah you move me
Baby
Aah you move me

I got your love
It's all that I got
I got your love
It's all I ever think about
I got your love
Every last drop
I got your love
It's all I ever think about
It's all I ever think about
It's all I ever think about

Oh, na, na, na, na, na, na
You're body, na na na na

[Verse 1]
Turn the lights down low
I'm ready to break it off
Since computer love
Been wanting to set it off
Like a hotel room
I'm checkin' into you
I'm diggin' like a shovel
All the things you do
Take a leap over the broom
That's how you're makin' me feel
Come on in this room
And let's keep it real and go

[Chorus]
Half on a baby
All I need is your body next to me
Singing ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your body, your body, na, na, na, na

I'm singing ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your body, your body, na, na, na, na

[Verse 2]
Now tell me what the deal is
Are you ready to bump
It's gonna take a lifetime
To give you all of this love
So baby, open up
And get ready to receive
A miracle of love
Gettin' down wit me
Like a baseball field
Wanna hit a home run
Me and you get together babe
And raise a little one

[Chorus]
Half on a baby
All I need is your body next to me
Singing ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your body, your body, na, na, na, na

Singing ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your body, your body, na, na, na, na

[Verse 3]
Set it off in a six
Baby, that'll be cool
Take a trip downtown
Between me and you
Trippin' on Perignon
Conversation like what
Not afraid to go down
Once you open up
After nine to five
You deserve some twelve
Makin' future plans
To be where I dwell

[Chorus]
Half on a baby
All I need is your body next to me
Singing ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your body, your body, na, na, na, na
Half on a baby

From my toes up
To my knee caps
To waistline
Now slowly lady
Can we go half on a baby?
From my toes up
To my knee caps
To waistline
Now slowly lady
Can we go half on a baby?

[Chorus]
Half on a baby
All I need is your body next to me
Singing ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Give me your body, your body, na, na, na, na
Half on a baby
All I need is your body next to me
Singing ooh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Can't you see that i'm lonely?
Rescue me, rescue me.......

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
This is war with no weapons, marching with no stepping
Murder with no killing, illing every direction
First, no sequel, do the math, no equal
John with no Yoko; more power, less people
And no, I'm not afraid of that, print it in your paperback
Every rap is made in fact to act as a delayed attack
Every phrase a razor blade that's saved until they play it back
To slay and leave 'em laying on the pavement, bang, fade to black

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the wastelands of today
When there's nothing left to lose
And there's nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose
In the wastelands of today
Where tomorrow disappears
While the future slips away
And your hope turns into fear
In the wastelands of today

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Roll credits, you get it, the show is done
They're talking for just talking, but meaning, they got none
None of 'em come proper, they talk like a shotgun
But how many got bred with integrity? Not one
So no, I'm not afraid to see you suckers hold a blade to me
Ain't no way to shake the ground I built before you came to be
Take it how you take it, I'm the opposite of vacancy
And this is not negotiation, y'all can hate and wait and see

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the wastelands of today
When there's nothing left to lose
And there's nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose
In the wastelands of today
Where tomorrow disappears
While the future slips away
And your hope turns into fear
And your hope turns into fear

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
In the wastelands of today

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the wastelands of today
When there's nothing left to lose
And there's nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose
In the wastelands of today
Where tomorrow disappears
While the future slips away
And your hope turns into fear
And your hope turns into fear
In the wastelands of today
In the wastelands of today
In the wastelands of today

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
And I try

Believe me, I try
I sure enough try
But I can't get no
I can't get no
No

[Verse 1]
When I'm driving in my car
And a man comes on the radio
Telling me more and more
About some useless information
That's supposed to power my imagination
I can't get no
Oh, no-no-no
Hey, what I say, yeah
Aw, baby, that's what I say
Yes, it is
Hey-hey-hey
Aw, baby, baby, that's what I say

And I try

Did you hear me, I try
And I try, and I try, and I try, try, try
I can't get no
Oh, oh, I can't get no, no, baby

[Verse 2]
Well, I don't know what I can do
When I just can't do no more
Each thing new and different I try
Seems to turn out to be one big bore

[Outro]
I can't get no
Oh, no-no-no
Hey, yeah-yay-hey
Oh, baby, that's what I say
Said I'm fed up
Hey-yeah-yeah

[Intro]
Oh baby
Ohhhhh

[Verse 1]
Love was always supposed to be
Something wonderful to me
To watch it grow inside yourself
To feel your heart beside itself

[Chorus]
Sometimes it hurts to love so bad
(When you know you've given all you can)
Sometimes it hurts to even laugh
(You do your best but it's still much too bad)
Sometimes the pain is just too much
And it hurts like hell
That's the way it feels

[Verse 2]
True love
It has no hiding place
It's not something you just put away
It's always there inside of you
Ohhh, and it shows in everything you do

[Chorus]
Sometimes it hurts to love so bad
(When you know you've given it your best)
Sometimes it hurts to even laugh
(You feel a thousand miles from happiness)
Sometimes the pain is just too much
And it hurts like hell
That's the way it feels

[Bridge]
Here we are, the two of us
So full of love, so little trust
But dying for some tenderness
Ooohhh, but too afraid to take the step

[Chorus]
Sometimes it hurts to love so bad
(When you know what it can put you through)
Sometimes it hurts to even laugh
(There's nothing funny if it's killing you)
Sometimes the pain is just too much
And it hurts like hell
That's the way it feels

[Verse 3]
I know if there is any chance
For us to find our happiness
We've got to learn to let it go
Ohhh oh, forget all the pain we knew

[Outro]
Sometimes it hurts to love so bad
Sometimes it hurts it hurts to even laugh
And it hurts like hell
That's the way
Oh baby
That's the way it feels

[Verse 1]
Jeremiah was a bullfrog was a good friend of mine

But i helped him a-drink his wine
And he always had some mighty fine wine, singing

[Chorus]
Joy to the world

Joy to you and me

(There's a rose in black at spanish harlem)
(A rose in black at spanish harlem)

[Verse 1 - Aretha Franklin ]
It is the special one
It never sees the sun
It only comes up
When the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street
Right up through the concrete
But soft sweet and dreamy

[Chorus - Aretha Franklin ]
(There is a rose in spanish harlem)
(A rose in black at spanish harlem)

[Verse 2 - Aretha Franklin ]
With eyes as black as coal
That look down in his soul
It start a fire there and then he looses control
I'm gonna beg his par-ar-ar-ardon yeah
He's going to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows
In his garden

[Chorus - Aretha Franklin ]
(There is a rose in spanish harlem uum uum)

And start a fire there and then he loses control
And i wanna beg his par-ar-ar-don
He's going to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows
In his garden

[Verse 1]
They put the world in a tin can
Black market contraband
And it hurt just a little bit
When they sliced and packaged it
In a long black trench coat
Two hands around the throat
Oh, you wanna get it right sometimes

[Verse 2]
There's so much to be scared of
And not much to make sense of
How did the clowns ever get control?
Oh, if you hear can you let me know
How can they invade it
Oh, when it's so complicated?
Oh, you wanna get it right sometimes
You just wanna get it right sometimes

[Chorus]
That's how you see the world
How many times can you say
You can't believe what you heard?
That's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
You're not gonna get hurt
Oooh

[Verse 3]
Is there's something missing
There's nobody listening
Are you're running in a circle
How can you be too careful?
We don't wanna be man-trapped
We don't wanna be shrink-wrapped
Oh, just wanna get it right sometimes
We just wanna get it right sometimes

[Chorus]
That's how you see the world
How many times have you heard
That you can't believe a word
That's how you see the world
Oh, don't you worry yourself
'Cause nobody can hurt you

[Outro]
That's how you see the world
That's how you see the world

And this don’t come from the store it’s from the weedman
Roll it up don’t give a fuck about police man
Burn a pound look like we’re gonna need a fireman
Thought I had a problem, went to see the preacher man
Said “Ain’t nothing wrong you been smoking gas man”
Even used to get in trouble with the teacher man
He said “Next time you come to school high be the last man”
I be teaching bitches how to clear the bong man
All these plants you would think I was a farmer man
Eyes low, blowing smoke, need a driver man
Even though it’s against the rules, let me smoke man

Smoke so much you would think I was an island man
Told them “Don’t need to knock it ‘til you try it man”

On the boat I get high like a pilot man
Learn the rules, check the pack, ‘fore you buy it man
Roll it up, light it up, that’s that fire man

Ball hog, go hard for a living
Still cheese eggs in my kitchen
Still even though we gettin' stoned, we still stickin' to the mission
Still take a nigga bitch
Still put a nigga on his feet and make him rich if you fuck wit em
Destiny ain't no luck just a couple niggas with felonies that I grew up with
Aww shit's what they sayin'
The shit we smoke cut through everything that the owners spray The money coming like every day
But never let this shit control me, fuck what the teacher told me!
Of course that weed I keep it on me
I paint pictures, don’t forget to bring a brush for all my niggas
And niggas think they ill when they rap but I'm the sickest
C'ause where I'm from its about who go the hardest not the quickest
Little nigga, big engine, big units, big business
Been doin' it, been spendin', me and you a big difference, yeah
Still ridin' in my whip with the old suspension
Grindin' hard like I ain't got the rent, I need every cent

Yellow tape, first forty eight
Don't give a fuck if they catch a case
Done gunplays in broad daylight
No mask on they barren face
Barren face when we get them
Don't become a victim
Shoulda used his intuition
When I caught him slipping
Open banana peel ass, nigga
We got your number
Put them in the trunk
Yreat them like some Louie luggage
Just in case a nigga think he finna take mine
Imma give his ass a clip
Tell the pussy nigga, take five
Real street niggas, get it how they live
Cut that gangsta shit out
'Cause that ain't who you is

[Hook: Juicy J] 

[x2]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Niggas telling, aw, man, they ain't getting money
How you get caught up for a strap and tell on your homie
Nigga, there's rules to this game and you ain't living by them
Like you don't talk about them drugs, if you really buy them
You don't talk about them goons, if you really got them
And you don't talk about them bodies, if they really dropping
You from where I'm from, you don't do no talking
When the police come, we just change the topic
In my hood niggas really robbing
You get your brains blown off, if you don't use precaution
Take off your head just be like what the cost is
In Pittsburgh it's Taylor Gang and nigga I'm a boss man, uh

[Bridge: Juicy J]
Word on the town, that you niggas snitching
Word on the town, I'm fucking niggas bitches

If you run up on that Bentley, bitch, your life is on the line
Yeah, bitch, I'm on parole, but that thing in my possession
Ain't gon' be no ho and pimping, ain't gon' be no disrespecting
And I don't owe you niggas shit and I don't need no new buddies
I don't wanna fuck your bitch, cause the ho is too slutty
Jaws too nutty, kiss her lips, you eat a dick
I ain't came out here to play, I'm out here representing this shit
I'm not the king of the south, y'all can fight over the title
But I got more hoes calling me, than American Idol
Young Pimp C holding it down, come around with that fuck shit

Big bag of that, coming back for that
Roll ‘em back to back, keep a sack of that
Don’t imagine that, that’s a matter of fact
Eyes down in the clouds where you find ‘em at
In my MCM bag where the magic at?
Come back to my room, jump on the broom
Swear the magic happened, she hit the magic dragon
Her ass started clapping, I was glancing
Smoking kill, that’s that extra pack
Tell the DJ to bring it back and tell the weedman to bring a sack
I got a bong and I got a biatch, ass fat, body full of tats
Pick her up, fuck her on the jet, nothing less

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]

Where's the 'dro?
Drama Wiz
Count 'em up bitch
28 Grams

[Verse 1]
You know I stay high
I pull up in my ride
Shades so dark that you can't see my eyes
Smoking on loud, blowing on clouds
Just did a show but don't know the amount
Taking your bitch if you're leaving her out
You niggas so broke, you so homie the Clown
There she go over there
Other hoes don't compare
Throw them 1's in the air
Throw them 1's in the air
Kk with hash, a nigga with cash
I'm taking the money, smack it on her ass
She give me good brain, she ahead of her class
I came in her first but I'm leavin' her last

[Pre-Hook]
Baddest bitch in the club, gon' work somethin'
Bend it over for me baby, gon' twerk somethin'
Aww shit, don't hurt nothin'

[Hook]
You gon' pick up all this money when I throw it
You gon' pick up all this money when I throw it

You gon' pick up all this money when I throw it

[Verse 2]
I roll one, I roll two
One for me, one for you
When we high, ain't no tellin' what we do
No where to go, so much to blow
Keepin' it private so nobody know
Doing your thing when you slide down the pole
Give you a drink, you get out of control
On your line cause you're nothin' like the rest of 'em
Oh, you know you're fucking with the best of 'em
Shots of that gin, her and a friend
We leave the club then I'm goin' in
Soon as I'm done, we do it again

[Pre-Hook]
Baddest bitch in the club, gon' work somethin'
Bend it over for me baby, gon' twerk somethin'

One minute on the team, next minute they ain't withcha
Like the ho from the Clippers
Laid up watchin' movies in my Bathing Ape slippers

Kush conin', at the table taking shots and it's gone then
As I called it
(Your bitch want me, woah
Aw man, shit, aye! 28 grams nigga)

[Intro]
Y’ll already know what it is
We the last…

[Verse 1]
At night that’s when all the lights shine
Ask the stewardess what’s the flight time
Know we grown we all got shit to say
But we drunk so it’s the right time
Outer Space they got a high climb
Out of sight, I’m out of my mind
I did everything on my own, so
I could give a fuck how your advice sound
Who you know sick as Ca-P though
Flow tight as the clothes on the niggas who fight crime
It’s cool to dream I suppose, you never know how far it might go
You might need some love, it might get shown
You might stumble down the right road
Got problems with the structure? Time to renovate
Boy tighten up your circle, keep your business straight

[Chorus]
Cause we're the last free souls in the world on our own
Just roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'
Cause we're the last free souls in the world on our own
Just roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'

[Verse 2]
We the niggas who could have it all
We the ones who only dream of it then do it on our own
Smoking one and got another roll
Came a long way from no direction now to formation
More legit, more to make, more to spend
Got a thing for champagne? Order it
Waking up in my trap house burning hella spliffs, grinding
Listening to Dolomite rhyming, I’m in
Exclusive bay, break you off something and I’ve got moves to make
Don’t be acting bougie ‘cause you came through with Nate
No Reuss, real nigga before Protools
Got game from niggas that's from the old school
But we them new niggas,  you should roll through
Woke up in the morning fucked up but that’s part of it
I got weed smoke and all this gin, Khalifa always wins

[Chorus]
Cause we're the last free souls in the world on our own
Just roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'
Cause we're the last free souls in the world on our own
Just roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'

[Intro]
Uh, what is you saying? My money insane
I’m fresh off a plane, I'm rolling a plant
Girl why is you playing? Let’s stick to the plan
That weed is so good that it stick to my hand
It come from the land, I know I’m the man
Bought a few packs so they throw a few in
I don’t understand, I know what you payin'
I smoke ‘til it’s gone and grow it again (Huh?)
It ain't nothin’ to get that zip off
It ain't nothin’ to get that zip off

[Verse 1]
I was smoking trees at the party acting gnarly
I got hundred pounds of weed, talkin' shawty, what ya need?
Kush be so strong, hit it once it’s hard to breathe
Have you coughing up a lung, so much smoke you tryna leave
Blowing up a nigga phone, what I tell your ass?
Talking about that pack I ain’t tryna sell your ass
(God damn) Rollie on my wrist, doobie in my fist
Sipping on that Cris, definitely going to jail if I take a piss
It ain’t nothin’ to get that tip off
Arm out the window, it ain’t nothin’ to get that clip off
It ain't nothing to knock your clique off
Put it in her mouth, I swear she tried to suck my dick off (God Damn)

[Hook]
It ain't nothin’ to get that zip off
It ain't nothin’ to get that zip off
28 grams in a Ziploc
It ain't nothin’ to get that zip off

[Bridge]
Got one rolled up, you should roll one too
Let’s get fucked up, girl you know how we do
What time? What place? Drink gin, no chase
First time all out, next time call us

[Verse 2]
Don’t hit the bong, get the smoke is bad
Say you smoking strong, but you wrong, you been smoking trash
It ain't in my lungs if it ain’t that pressure
First thing in the morning grab my joint from out the dresser
Keep my OG in a jar ‘cause I like it fresh
Said he hit the weed, he ain’t ready yet
Steady flexin’ on these children like I’m WIllie Nelson
No discretion, come to drugs, I got a big selection

[Hook]
It ain't nothin’ to get that zip off
It ain't nothin’ to get that zip off
28 grams in a Ziploc
It ain't nothin’ to get that zip off

[Outro]
(Laughing) 28 grams nigga
The fuck you wanna do nigga?
I’m coning the joint while we talk right now nigga
Fuck wrong with you?
A zip at a time bitch, put that lil’ ass shit away
Fuck wrong with you niggas man
We do it big over here man, Taylor Gang
I’ll be in motherfuckin’ Denver on 4/20 nigga
Weed’s legal there, so that’s sweet
Y’ll niggas smoke like two joints a day
And you talkin’ bout you gettin’ high motherfucker
That’s cool, we gon’ continue to get dumb high
We ain’t abusing it, we using it

Wake up in the morning, time to smoke a joint
Talkin', talkin', to me - better get straight to the point
I talk a lot of shit cause no top is on my whip
I'm mobbin' with my chick and we coppin' all the shit
I'm rubbin' with my chick, paparazzi on my dick
Everytime I come around, they wanna take a pic
Got so many cars, I don't know which one to drive
Grab a flight to Vegas and the pilot let me fly

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Fuck niggas hate, real niggas get money all day
Fuck niggas hate, real niggas get money all day
Fuck niggas hate, real niggas get money all day
Fuck niggas hate, real niggas get money all day

[Verse 2: Gab3 of Uzi]
When I wake up in the morning then I gotta get stoned
And when I'm on the internet all I see is clones
I get cameras on me like my name is Mike Jones
Cameras with me and cameras flying on drones
You know I'm talkin' money if I'm talkin' on the phone
If it's not about the money, will you please leave me alone?
Met this little freak in Hollywood
She’s a Twitter freak, all she do is twerk and tweet
Everything changed, everything got strange
I've been making plays so the money's going crazy
I spark another one up when I'm hoppin' out, ballet
Always got my swagger, I’m Uzi McConaughey

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Fuck niggas hate, real niggas get money all day
Fuck niggas hate, real niggas get money all day
Fuck niggas hate, real niggas get money all day
Fuck niggas hate, real niggas get money all day

[Outro:]
Fuck niggas hate, real niggas get money all day
Fuck niggas hate, real niggas get money all day
Two cellphones hooked up when I'm tryna make a play
Everything's changing so fast
Fuck niggas hate, real niggas get money all day
Everything got different so fast
See ya'll on the tour, stay under the influence
Taylor!
Get money all day, get money all day, get money all day

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Kush in my hands, wake up smoking them grams
She say I'm the man, can't keep her face out my pants
Hand full of rings, gold on my sink
Don't even fuck with you, fuck what you think
Covered in ink
Bitches in love with me cause of my money
I know there'd be days like this
But, never knew I would wake up, roll a joint, do my thing, and get paid like this
I walk in the bank, the shark out the tank
I give 'em that thing, he gone aim and don't blink
He aimin', don't blink
I'm doing everything that you can't

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Talkin' G's but you ain't 'round none
Get a pound in your city man, it ain't 'bout nothin'
If I gotta send it on a plane, I'mma get it
Give a fuck what a nigga think, boy I'm with it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tuki Carter]
You niggas some haters

You niggas is faker than ghosts by (?)
You niggas did salty, high sodium

You suckers is pussy
You focused on fuckin' the plans
Roll through the city, I'm rollin' with your ho
My nigga have no hope
I'm fuckin' your bitch and her pussy is so-so, be rolling up your dough
Your niggas ain't loyal, your whole crew was po-po but one of them rich
The rest of them (?), but most of you flex
A nigga that don't know you, don't know
My niggas got six cals more than your four-four
Pop up your top, one more shot to the top of your block
With that chop, you drop
You be talkin' no mo'
My bitches get bitches that come with more bitches, ya'll niggas ain't got no hoes
We come to your city, we takin' your biddies and leavin' out with bolos

As bad as you are
Why would you wanna fuck with a nigga like me girl?
Why would you wanna roll weed for a nigga like me girl?
Why would you wanna throw the ass for a nigga like me girl?
Grind on her when you throw that ass for a nigga like me?
You, you, you, you, know what you want
You remember where you came from
Oh yea, you know the business
I swear that pussy is the business
Might give your ass the business
You, you, ugh

[Verse 1:]
We going away
She riding for the kid
Riding for the squad
Riding on this dick
Gone with the wind
Gone with the whip
Gone on the liquor
She going to my crib
Phone blowing up
Kush coned up
Sheets all wet
Hair messed up
Tied around my neck
Face on deck
Just let a nigga know what it is
Still want you (x3)



You! for real

[Outro:]
Yea, bitch

Hey, hey, woah, church

Word on the streets, Khalifa's a beast
Shit, 'bout to go D-Wade, hit 'em with the heat
Fuck with me, I'm the realest, realest, nigga, I'm the realest
Blowing on killer while I'm listen to Killa
Body full of tattoos like a killer
Word on the streets that I got these niggas upset
All my niggas from the bottom, from the projects
I take a bitch home, give her long dick, that long dick
Yes, hit it then I quit it
And when I'm in it get the pussy so wet think I'm 'bout to go swimming
God damn

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Nigga got cash, talking big cash, nigga blow kush, talking big bags
Niggas still hating on a nigga, hit the weed once, do the Wiz laugh
Got faded in a mug, god damn I'm tailored up
Got - papers in my lungs, got it straight from the plug
Got - what you smoking, nigga?

[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]
This a whole P, it ain't no seeds
But on the real I'mma probably need the whole tree
Can't fuck with you acting like the police
The way your bitch pop the pussy, had to go see
It ain't nothing for your girl like ho, please
Let you down to do a favor like you owe me
Soul Train diamonds dancing in this AP
Taylor Gang, pussy nigga, you don't know me
Droptop with some twins in it
Ha, what you doing, boy, I been did it
Yeah, roll up, let your friends hit it
Ha, around my city, boy, I been did it
Man, I can't even lie, y'all don't get high like that
In the ride like that with a ride like that
Trey pound like that, but it's all in them raps
Stop lying to them people acting like you got the pack right now

[?] it's how you act a real round
Got a ticket on your head, let my homie hit the lotto
Big niggas, I don't fight it, see the boom or a bottle
Word on the street I'm a suspect
Helicopter too now, I'm a subject
Face on the news nigga, for the public
Gotta hide at my cousins in the projects
Smoking weed with the Crips in the complex
Twisting OG's with the Bloods in the comments
'Cause only killer they see is green
And they gon' do anything for the commas
T.G.O.D., now they wanna call the feds
I'm a king smoking all this, all this grass
What you smoking on, nigga? That's a thread full of trash
I was in the 9th grade smoking weed after class
Just a tilt door looking like your car on fire
This the weed mix, you gon' need a few lighters
You ain't never smoke no fucking KK, nigga
And we don't smoke no motherfucking AK, nigga
Word on the street buy a whole one
Get good with the plug, he gon' throw one
Serve your homie who ain't never gon' say shit
Chef it up in the face like a shogun

Come back, come back, come back, come back to me
I wanna roll one up, wanna roll one up with you

[Verse 1]
Met her at a party, I was sippin' gin
She was burnin' on the chronic
Thunder beat the Lakers now there ain't no Super Sonics
Chain hella flossy
Waitin' for you to come over here and put it on me
You down to ride and you like say no more
Try to hide it but I can't no more
And God blessed me with game but I ain't playin' though
Instead of fuckin' with lames
(I just want you)
You ain't ain't said nothing but a word
Twist up the herb
Tell your friends they ain't gotta catch feelings
There's enough room for all ya'll - skinny, fat, tall
Believe me, I done seen it all, done it all
Born to ball, do it big, never small
The weed I'm smokin' on
Come over here, tell your homegirls go ahead
Roll another joint and get straight to the point

[Hook]
Come back, come back, come back, come back to me
I wanna roll one up, wanna roll one up with you
Come back, come back, come back, come back to me
I wanna roll one up, wanna roll one up with you

[Verse 2]
Now the hoes done shown up, the money done blown up
But every time you callin' a nigga, I pick the phone up
Don't care about my pockets being swole up
Long as I show love, show up, my top won't go up
Everyday's a new flight, at night's a new hotel
Fuck you on plane, it don't matter girl I won't tell
Both feet in the sand, you know I'm the man
We gone stick to the plan, watch 'em shit on demand
Early morning eatin' breakfast in the hot tub
Pedicure, Manny, full massage with the face scrub
Smokin' OG, fuck the police
Sun glowin' off your skin
Said she never been there before, she tryna do it again
I can't only fuck once, I'm tryna do it again
Hold up, it's meant to be
No luck, here's some weed, roll up
Make sure the neighbors know us

[Hook]
Come back, come back, come back, come back to me
I wanna roll one up, wanna roll one up with you
Come back, come back, come back, come back to me
I wanna roll one up, wanna roll one up with you

[Outro]
You know what it is!
Hey, hey, hey, shit, damn

That ass is lookin' special
You make everything in the world look special
And you rep that gang baby girl
Sledgro, RMB, Thundercat, what up Drew, Chev what up cuh

[Verse 1]
He used to call me DN
That stood for Deadly Nightshade
'Cause I was filled with poison
But blessed with beauty and rage
Jim told me that, he hit me and it felt like a kiss
Jim brought me back, reminded me of when we were kids

[Chorus]
With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence

[Verse 2]
He used to call me poison
Like I was Poison Ivy
I could have died right there
'Cause he was right beside me
Jim raised me up, he hurt me but it felt like true love
Jim taught me that, loving him was never enough

[Chorus]
With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence

[Bridge]
We could go back to New York
Loving you was really hard
We could go back to Woodstock
Where they don't know who we are
Heaven is on Earth
I would do anything for you, baby
Blessed is this union
Crying tears of gold like lemonade

[Interlude]
I love you the first time, I love you the last time
Yo soy la princesa, comprende mis white lines
'Cause I'm your jazz singer and you're my cult leader
I love you forever, I love you forever

[Chorus]
With his ultraviolence (Lay me down tonight)
Ultraviolence (In my linen and curls)
Ultraviolence (Lay me down tonight)
Ultraviolence (Riviera Girls)
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence

[Hook]
I woke up in a bed full of bitches that I ain't even fuckin'
Fell asleep in a bed full of bitches that I ain't even fuckin'
Like Jimmy, like Jimmy, like Jimmy, like Jimmy
I smoke a joint and wrapped a band around my motherfucking head like Jimmy

[Verse 1]
Niggas mad at me cause the hoes that I leave with so pretty
I'm a badass, do my own thing when I'm in your city
Purple haze, I'm on purple haze
To come down, I need a couple days
Bitches kissin' on me
Drinkin' liquor, takin' naked pictures for me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Fuck you with my vest and my boots on
Skinny but it's wide and it's real long
Red wine got her zonin'
Flip my tongue, now she open
If she bad I want it
Ass fat, got my name tatted on it

[Hook]

[Outro]
Don't call my phone with that fuck shit, nigga
If you call my phone it better be about some money
It better be about a God damn appointment that I missed
Or your hand better be on fire
Don't call my phone with that fuck shit.com
Follow me at don't call my phone with that fuck shit

[Intro]
For real man, we need that whip
That's the car I need
Motherfucker hit a plane and the plane blew up
Ugh, yup

[Verse 1]
Standing in the mirror
My vision of that money getting clearer
Scratch that, it's getting nearer
Some of this actually happened
I was weed nappin'
Wasn't shit
Now they pay us for the raps we kick
My hotel smell like confidence
They hate us but that weed smoke bring on compliments
So roll this paper
Tell the waitress - get my drink from off the coaster
Bring the bitch that love to smoke and get the weight from off my shoulders

[Interlude]
Yeah, I be flying everywhere nigga
Sometimes I don't even know where the fuck I'm at
I be waking up, random motherfuckers be knocking on my door and shit
Like "who the fuck is that?"
Nosey ass cleaning lady
You wanna hit this weed?

[Verse 2]
Stains from your make-up
Roll me up a joint soon as I wake up
Young nigga, but got my cake up
Now I'm hoppin' off of the plane
Smelling like the sweetest scent, weed is lit
Look at my bitch, we the shit
Probably high - what they say when they see us
But they never say that we broke
Kush in every J that we smoke
Putting rings on every finger
Never put 'em out, just let the smoke linger
Champagne for the girls, straight shots for my niggas
Started small but now the money getting bigger
It all get better with time
Rather go hard instead of unwind
And play your part and I'mma play mine

[Interlude 2]
Feel me?
Motherfuckers always speakin' out of turn
They don't know nothin' about this shit
That's why I'm me and you're you
Matter of fact, fuck that
This Taylor Gang
T.G.O.D. nigga
Ain't shit changed gang
What up Ricky P
Richard
Don't smoke that pound without me Richard
Don't eat your dinner in the bathroom

[Outro]
Jim Brown smash baby
Oh shit! We get to see the tits?
Here we go!
Get her Jim! Get her Jim!
Oh shit!
I don't get no sleep
I'm fresh off the plane
I don't get no sleep, God damn

[Intro:]
One thing's for sure, two things for certain man
I be on one, Young Khalifa man, burn up

[Hook:]
All my nights that I spent on my own tryna find my way
All the chances we take right or wrong' now we counting all day
I done been through the pain - seen it all for the fortune and fame
And did it for a first class flight on a plane

[Verse 1:]
Can you stand the rain?
Can you niggas really stand the pain?
Can you stand to sit for 14 hours on the plane
If you get caught, you'll never smoke again
I'm leaving niggas with no bitches and cruel intentions
Make 'em dig in they pockets, makin' 'em pay attention
I don't gotta talk it cause God I live it
Say the competition, they all gonna be missin'
That's part of the mission, we ball and they missin'
Order all them rooms up, let all of my nigs in
We hop out them bitches, stay on our toes
Money over hoes, man that's just the way it goes
Weed in a bowl, pack shows, me and my bros
Nominated for Grammy's so, you don't hear me though
Say that I changed, I just say that I've been laying low
Try and play your role, that's the way it go
Ya'll already know

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
Blacc Hollywood on the way

[Produced by Metro Boomin]

[Intro:]
Hey Wiz, they tryna lock a nigga up
How many grams they asked you you had?
What you tell 'em?
28 right?

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Bad bitch come to my crib, handle my business
Let a nigga know shit's real, handle my business
Handle my business, nigga, I handle my business
Handle my business, nigga, I handle my business
Smokin' pounds of kush, handle my business
Ridin' in a brand new car, woosh, handle my business
Handle my business, handle my business, handle my business

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Smokin' on the kush, ridin' in a brand new whip
Feelin' like a pimp
Damn my money good
I wish a bitch nigga would, I wish a bitch nigga would
Handle my business, I'mma handle my business
Handle my business, I'mma handle my business
Handle my business, got a handful of Benji's
Hand on the strap, I'mma handle that witness
I'mma handle that car, I'mma handle that bitch
She gonna handle this dick
After that, roll some weed up
Chill with my feet up
Ya'll some hand-me-down niggas
Posted in the car with the top down smokin' on the shit that'll paralyze niggas

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

[Verse 2: J.R. Donato]
High as fuck and it's 28 grams later
Keep the Ruger, I'mma shoot it in a damn skater
I'm from the Chi but Atlanta where I'm gonna take her
If I put her on the corner then I'm gonna break her
(Make her handle my business, straight up out the trenches
Young nigga tryna double my digits while I'm kickin' this pimpin')
Two white cups sippin', ride around piped up gettin' it
Chain so bright that it might cause tension
Rock the Benz all Spring, so they know it ain't rented
Feelin' like a Beatle, god damn, John Lennon
Put my finger on the trigger, I be sprayin' for a minute
I tell 'em, wait, wait, let me handle that
Little steak, Little eggs, let me scramble that
Two guns, two clips, finna Rambo that
Tell their hoes I'm bouta fire, where they candles at?
Where they candles at?
Cause I be sippin' on somethin'
Never been a Goofy, shootin' a movie
Table full of shroomies while I'm rollin' the doobie
You starin' at me like you wanna hit it or somethin'
Your bitch lookin' like she want the dinik or somethin'
I prolly give her the somethin' in addition to somethin'
Cookin' like I'm in the kitchen or somethin'
You lookin' broke boy, get you some money
Donato

You the late night type, you would spend a little, too
Ride with me, spend time with me
Unwind with me, so I could read
And be on top of me
In front of me
Having fun with me
Girl, for none of me

And when we smoke, we gotta use some incense, babe
And when I stroke, you gonna remember my name when I'm in it
Go longer than them candles burn

You want it all? You get it all
Where my down-South girls? Where my Eastcoast girls?
Where my Westcoast girls? Where my Chi-town girls?
My Toronto girl
Oh, I know you with it
Out of France, they say that I'm the man

[Hook]
And when we smoke, we gotta use them incense babe
When I stroke, I'mma go slow when I'm in it

Hey I got a joint and I ain't even roll it, here roll it

Prices going up, down, I ain’t got no problem spending all of my money
Tryna see what’s up now, I’mma smoke it all with me and my homies

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Rolling up ‘cause that’s all that I know
Joint in my hand when I walk through the door

Tryna get high while I’m already stoned
Yeah, bomb weed and its all that I know
Feeling like a boss ‘cause it’s already rolled up
Go hard ‘cause that’s all that I know
Get a little money then I throw it on the floor
Girl, champagne I’mma pour a little more
We can smoke cones ‘til four in the morning

A millionaire and it’s all that I know
Probably with your girl getting blown

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]

[Verse 2: Berner]
Bring it back, bring it back
Gold ropes and new leather on my coat rack
Four stacks, these dudes hold no pack, throwback
Jerry Rice running gold hat, hold that, I ain’t even roll that
Smoke fat on the corner where the blow at
OG from the city, where the SKO at?
Broke boys made they ain't got their ho back
Blow big I’m world-wide touring

New foreign, new foreign, blue cookies more champagne pouring
Gon' get it, gon’ get it girl, got a bitch that will hit the road with it, cold business
Out of town it go up down, we celebrating when it touch down

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Hey I got a joint and I ain't even roll it, here roll it

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
I roll ‘em thicker than a Snicker
Girl drink this liquor
I got game from the bishop
Bust that thing down for Winston

[Verse 1]
Hey, I feel like I just blow on up
Anytime I could just lose control, caught up
In your loving, everytime I feel your touch
Second thoughts, more doubts started building up

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're everything I wanted
Before I knew just what I wanted
And hey, hey, you're killing me on the inside
And you're the only one I want, I can't deny

[Chorus]
Don't know what to do, what to say
I'm not sure what to tell you, confused
Which way do I take your hand or let go?
(Do I) take your hand or let it go?
(I can't) take this feeling much more
(Do I) take your hand or let go? (Go)
Don't know what to do, what to say
I'm not sure what to tell you, confused
Which way do I go?

[Verse 2]
Hey, I feel like I just blow on up
Every time I feel your love, I get so caught up
It's your kissing, your touch, it's just everything
But I'm feeling like I wanna just run away

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm here to tell you what I want
But you're everything I want
And hey, hey, it's killing me on the inside
'Cause you're all I ever wanted, so I can't deny

[Chorus]
Don't know what to do, what to say
I'm not sure what to tell you, confused
Which way do I take your hand or let go?
(Do I) take your hand or let it go?
(I can't) take this feeling much more
(Do I) take your hand or let go? (Go)
Don't know what to do, what to say
I'm not sure what to tell you, confused
Which way do I go?

[Bridge]
Somebody tell me (Oh)
Is it that I'm so wrong? I can't say (say)
Or is it my life? So young, careless ways
And in your eyes, so much love you wanna give
But the more I hold you in my arms
The pressure starts to build (Build)
Build it up (Build, build, build)

[Chorus]
Don't know what to do, what to say
I'm not sure what to tell you, confused
Which way do I take your hand or let go?
(Do I) take your hand or let it go?
(I can't) take this feeling much more
(Do I) take your hand or let go? (Go)
Don't know what to do, what to say
I'm not sure what to tell you, confused
Which way do I take your hand or let go?
Take your hand or let it go?
Take your hand or let go?
Take your hand or let it go?
Take your hand or let go?
Take your hand or let it go?
Take your hand or let go?
Take your hand or let it go?
Take your hand or let go?
Take your hand or let go?

[Verse]
Ahh

Look how far we've come
You're still here (ummmmm)
This is us (yeah)
These (these are my) are my confessions
Still going strong
(So far to go, ahh, ahh)
(Yeah) Yeah, man
Let it go...

[Verse]
This goes out to you, you
My number one (Number one, number one)
I won't stop until I see you, sugar
You know who you are
This is for my number one (I see you), number one
So many shows
Swear wherever I go, I'm gonna keep on lookin', yeah
Lookin' for my number one, number one
Oh, this goes out to you, baby
Wherever you are (My only one)
Just know that you're mine (Number one, number one), yeah

[Break]
Are you there? I can't hear you
On the road, doin' shows
Girl, I can't get you off my mind
All around the world
So many faces, all these places
And I just need one
My number one
This is for you (Looking for my number one)
You, my number one

[Outro: crowd chanting]
Usher! Usher! Usher! Usher! Usher!

[Verse 1]
I've got two-dozen roses
And a card that says, "Baby, I can't wait to see you later"
We made dinner reservations
At Nobu, Mr. Chow's, you just pick the location
Now we're sitting at the table, sipping the finest wine
Having a damn good time, I know what's on your mind
I want you, you want me too
Stop fronting, I know exactly what you want, you wanna...

[Chorus]
Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch my body, baby, body, baby
Do it to me, I guarantee you won't regret it
Let me set it out like you ain't never had it
Do it to me, I want you to grab me, talk to me
Tell me how you like it, when you want it, when you all up on it
Do it to me, I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna make this a night to remember

[Verse 2]
Watching you work the stick in the ride
The motion how you move from 3rd to 5
Can't imagine what it’s gon' be once we get inside
And you put that ooh wee on me and you work me the same way
Ooh, I can't wait
(I'm tired of thinking about it, speaking about it
Baby, it's time to be about it
Turn off the lights, tear off your clothes
Jump in the bed and let it flow)
Squeezing, holding, biting, scratching, spanking, screaming
Pulling my hair when you need me
Everything goes, baby, when you...

[Chorus]
Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch my body, baby, body, baby
Do it to me, I guarantee you won't regret it
Let me set it out like you ain't never had it
Do it to me, I want you to grab me, talk to me
Tell me how you like it, when you want it, when you all up on it
Do it to me, I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna make this a night to remember

[Bridge]
So long I've waited for this night to get inside you
Look in your eyes and tell you, "Baby, take me, I'm yours"
And if you feel anything like I feel
By the end of the night, I'm certain you'll be screaming for more
I wanna do anything and everything to your body
'Til you break down, can't take no more
From the bed to the floor, to the top of the stairs
You gon' get it, baby
Please, please, oh… do it to me

[Chorus]
Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch my body, baby, body, baby
Do it to me, I guarantee you won't regret it
Let me set it out like you ain't never had it
Do it to me, I want you to grab me, talk to me
Tell me how you like it, when you want it, when you all up on it
Do it to me, I'm gonna give it to you
I'm gonna make this a night to remember

[Intro]
What we gon' do now? (Oh Lord, try some if you like it)
Is slow it down on the floor (you know you like that)
(Try some if you like that)
Oh Lord, uh oh
Uh oh, yeah, peep game
Come on

[Verse 1]
When you look from outside
All you see is videos and shows (yeah)
But there's more to my life than people could ever know (uh huh)
Sometimes I gotta smile (smile) when I don't feel like smiling
Sit back and ride (ride) when I feel like driving
Nobody understands but you, girl (fo' sho')
I can always be myself with you, girl
That's why I'm singing

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooooh, I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way

[Chorus]
Uh oh, that's why I had to say
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me
That's why I had to say
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me
Uh oh, that's why I had to say
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me now
Right now (right now)

[Verse 2]
Since you've been in my life, when I'm away from you, I hurry home (aww yeah, I hurry home)
You live in my mind, so I never feel like I'm alone, yeah (alone)
Sometimes I gotta go (go) where I don't feel like going
And when it gets too fast (fast) and I feel like slowing down (slowing down)
No one understands but you
That's why I only see myself with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooooh, I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way
(Real girls stay down, that's fo' sure)
Ooooh, I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way

[Chorus]
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me (come now)
Come follow me, come follow me
Come follow me (girl come follow me now)
Come follow me, come follow me
Come follow me now (oooh), right now (right now)

[Bridge]
You've been there for me and I'll (so I'll)
I'll be there for you girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooooh, I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way (oh, shorty)
Ooooh, I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way
Ooooh, I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way

[Chorus]
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me
(What we gon' do now)
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me
(Is slow it down on the floor)
Come follow me, come follow me
Come follow me now, right now
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me...

[Intro]
It's crazy
I can't believe that you
Would be the one to do
Do me like you do
Get back here, baby

[Verse 1]
When you let me have my way
I was thinking I could get it again
Baby, we could be friends if you're lonely
And then you showed me just how quick your tires could spin
You were off in the wind, tell me, where did you go?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When you left, I'm thinking, "Which way did she go?"
I should have known that you led me on, girl
I'm in the wind on cruise control
I gotta be dreaming 'cause I never felt like this before

[Chorus]
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
But she's got me sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
So why am I sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her?

[Verse 2]
Now it's raining and I'm looking over at the passenger side
Thinking back in my mind how you set me off
She was stopping and dropping me, switching from fast to slow
But that had nothing on how you got when I got you home

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When you left, I'm thinking, "Which way did she go?"
The way you touched yourself had me up the wall
I'm in the wind on cruise control
I'm searching for you 'cause I can't seem to let you go

[Chorus]
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
But she's got me sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
So why am I sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her?

[Interlude]
You know
I really only thought
That this would be a one night stand
What you doing to me?
Come on
What you doing to me?

[Bridge]
Maybe she's running home to someone else
Or maybe she lost my number in her cell
Or maybe she's run it down like this before
'Cause I can't see her not coming back for more, more

[Chorus]
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
But she's got me sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
So why am I sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her?
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
But she's got me sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
So why am I sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her?

Sensuous, sexy, voluptuous, hah

If you got it, you got it
Seduce me baby, seduce me

[Verse 1]
Just to get my attention, send a note and a drink
When we made eye connection, she nodded and winked
On this note it said, "It's 'bout time we get together
Let's dance now, hook up later, we can do whatever"
She had confidence, it's all part of the game
'Cause to her, who I'm with don't really mean a thing
She knew what I liked and now I'm thirsty for more, baby

[Chorus]
Seduction
Sensuous, sexy, erotic

Down with you (down), down with you (down, down)

Baby, you got my attention, what you gon' do with it? (Ha ha)
Baby, turn around, stick it out, I wanna see it
She'll make the first move, smooth, intoxicating
She crazy (I like it, I'ma be honest)
I'm fighting not to lose control
I'm feeling a little tension, don't know whose watching
Getting big (in too deep, and I can't stop it)

How you working your body
You gon' make me do it, do it to you
Seduction (oh oh)
You thought out your best to get me out of control, baby
More I play around with you
Make me wanna get down with you (down)
Down with you (down), down with you (down, down)

[Bridge]
Baby, whatever you want, girl, you got it
Long as you're satisfied
'Cause it's so hard to resist
Ooh, your body got me on fire
Got vivid thoughts in my mind
The positions that I'm gonna try
But is it worth all the hurt?
Should I risk it just for one night?
Once I give in
She's gonna win
Either way I lose

[Verse 3]
I'm trying to chill, but she got me on the spot
She's so cocky and the way that she watching me
Got me feeling hot, uh
Shorty know that I got a girl and I really can't break the rules
Plus paparazzi snapping shots
And it's hard for me to shake these fools
So do I one: put it on her, work my way to the front?
Do I two: play my part and sure, don't try to pull no stunts?
Or maybe three: (yeah) chase the cat 'cause she's sending me on the hunt
Nah, bump that, I ain't no punk
I'ma give the shorty what she want
Watch this

[Chorus]
Seduction (ready to go)
Sensuous, (taking you up on what you said earlier) sexy, erotic
How you working your body (when we danced)
You gon' make me do it, do it to you
Seduction
You thought out your best to get me out of control, baby
More I play around with you
Make me wanna get down with you (down)
Down with you (down), down with you (down, down)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Small World
(Let's go!)
Let's give it to the mind of a man
Who the mind over manner, won't beef like rude Chris
You gotta know that you gotta go through
Me and my clique if you want to get to Ludacris
I'm a real street dude with a chip on a shoulder
The size of a boulder, my heart got colder
Since I got signed and I got
My pinky ring frozen up like I'm polar (yeah)
Young but I act like I'm older
Cause my money got growed up, my gun got a motor
That I crank like that Roosevelt
For that bread I pop that toaster (uh)

Brolic, Shareefa, Shawnna, Bobby, BlockXChange and
Serious Jones, and jackpot hotter than a sauna (sauna)

Catch me in a party in ATL and
I bet your baby don't got more bottles (no)
I'm from Raleigh North Carolina (yeah)
Get in line 'fore I get you lined up
Push your weave back, to where your neck at
At the top of your spinal (yeah)
When my album drop, they'll worry in Compton
To see how much I have been copied (yeah)
Lil' mamma don't want me to stop it (no)
Cause I keep goin' like an energizer
I'm worth more than your billion dollars (yeah)
And, my swag's phenomenal
See me in Prada, Louis Vuitton
It's why I get compliments from your momma
Cause my

[Hook]

[Verse]
I've walked alone and felt as if no one cared
All the days so dark and dim
But it's like the rays of the sun somehow came down
To shine when you are around
And I always thought that I'd never find that one
To make me feel forever young
But if I had one wish
My life to share would be with you and no one else
If I had open arms, would you have a heart to spare?
If ever you want me near
I'll be there to run and say and I'm here
Giving you someone that understands
And a love that will never end
I can be all that you need and more

[Verse 1]
I'm doing alright, most of the time
In fact, yesterday, I was even doing real well and I
Think that I might claim you as mine
So that my head can rest and everybody can tell, and I

[Chorus]
Had a strange dream and I
Called you at night and I
Had to make known that I wasn't alright
And say that I had you on my mind
Had you on my mind

[Verse 2]
I make it a point to rest through my day
To close my eyes and visualize my troubles away and I
Think of you here and I close my eyes tight
Somehow the vision of you near makes me feel alright and I

[Chorus]
Had a strange dream and I
Called you at night and I
Had to make known that I wasn't alright
And say that I had you on my mind
Had you on my mind

[Outro]
Had you on my mind
Had you on my mind
Had you on my mind

[Verse 1 : Pharrell Williams]
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care, baby, by the way

[Hook : Pharrell Williams]
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

[Verse 2 : Sky Blu]
I'm a shining star dreaming of a brighter day
Where I can go through the meditation is my hideaway
Mind elevation, getting paid off creation
While all you suckas hating me and Shwayze rocking aces
There is a method to my madness, opposite of sadness
Sometimes its weed, sometimes its a bad bitch
Sometimes its giving somebody hungry a sandwich
The world is so cruel man I dont understand it
People doubted me, people doubted me
By any means necessary I will succeed
Its in my DNA, it's what I breathe, it's what I bleed
And bringing the world together is the legacy I lead

[Hook : Pharrell Williams]
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

[Bridge : Pharrell Williams]
Bring me down
Can't nothing bring me down
My level's too high to bring me down
Can't nothing bring me down, I said
Bring me down
Can't nothing bring me down
My level's too high to bring me down
Can't nothing bring me down, I said

[Hook : Pharrell Williams]
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Can't put my finger on it
But I know I want it
I'm willing to try another way
That is, if I get by another day
Back and forth, I don't get anywhere
And I've been searching everywhere

And I'll try tonight
Just try tonight

Happy as the moon shine
Sifting in the night-time
Clichés find a home inside of him
When he enters all of the lights go dim
He's so sure he's got a tragic lifestyle
And I'm so sure I can make that man smile

And I'll try tonight
Just try tonight

A dark room in the night-time
Is how he spends all his time
If he could go on without your help
Then he would do it all by himself
But I don't think he got strength to muster
And he don't got a lot - lacklustre
He'll try tonight
To not get high
He'll try tonight
To not get high
But he will, he will, he will, yes he will

[Chorus: Future]
I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm at Pluto, I'm at Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles, at the same damn time, ayy

[Verse 1: Akon]
I'm far with this shit, it's a lot going on at the same damn time right about now
I put that on my block, nigga this ain't nothin' new to me
Rollie on my wrist, designer shoes and a Gucci treat
Supermodel bitches and they frizz all in my bathroom'd up
Team money said they like 'er, I said fuck it then I'm passin' up
Got money to blow, I get it like I print it all
A million at the show, ain't no way that I could spend it all
Monday I be all up in my Lambo, cross me pocket chips
Tuesday pull the Rrari up, say I'm on some floss 'n' shit
Wednesday I'm confused, I don't know which car to head on with
I want something new, I'm about to buy some other shit
But I don't know which car to go in yea
I said fuck it, went and bought a lil' jet

[Chorus: Future]
I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time

I'm back up on my gunner shit, I fuck the bitch you comin' with
No squares in my circle, not the niggas that I haller with
God no, make no noise when I bust cause I muzzle it
1500 mill on the real I'm tryna double it
Fuck 'em with my diamond shine, fresh up off that diamond mine
Niggas come and get you like they propin' up in columbine
Columbine, propin' up in columbine
You don't want no problem, where I'm from they do this all the time
And you don't wanna gamble with your life
Like the chalk up on that sidewalk, my whips are all white
Crib is all white and that jewelry so bright
Multitask with this pimpin', we could do this all night

[Chorus: Future]
I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time

Start riding round with a rich nigga
Start riding round with a nigga thats rich

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
High-flying glider, spread your wings; flying high on a cloud
Borne on the air, spiral around
So busy making circles, you never touch the ground
You see the sea, feel the sky
Don't know where you go when you die
Don't know the answers to what's in my mind
Riding on the wind, turning with the tide

[Verse 2]
Light takes you up; it brings you down
Changes the pain that remains
Keep moving fast, through the wind and the rain
And if the world keeps spinning round, you'll be back again..

[Intro]
Ayy
They crowning me
They crowning me
Ayy

[Chorus]
Come try it, baby, come try it
Come try it, baby, come try it
Come try it, baby, come try it
Come try it, baby, come try it
Come try it, my diamonds a riot
We slippin' and slidin'

[Verse]
We ball 'til we fall
We got so many racks to blow
We got so many racks to blow
My shirt by Louis Vuitton
She think I'm the one
Just a young nigga that ran through the city
Whippin' and flippin' them chickens
I ride through in the Bentley
My niggas, they all from the country
VVS diamonds and pristine cuts
I'm shinin', I'm stuntin'
Yayo, yayo, all I know is yayo
Whippin' them chickens
Whippin' them chickens, no Crisco
We seeing money, it's simple, Rolex Presidential
You know I'm official, she know I'm official
You know I'm official, she know I'm official

[Chorus]
Baby, come try it
Baby, come try it, baby, come try it
Baby, come try it, baby, come try it
My diamonds a riot, we slippin' and slidin'
My diamonds a riot, we slippin' and slidin'

I say, "Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
I like the way your name echo
You are so fine"
I say, "Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
Do you wanna help me let go
Of my dark mind?"

[Chorus]
If you want it, it's yours
It's free, but of course
You're my sunshine
I say, "J, you're the boss
Without you I'm lost
You're my sunshine"

[Verse 3]
I say, "Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
You are on another level
You are so fine"
I say, "Hey Jimmy, let's go
I've been in love since I met you
You are all mine"

[Chorus]
If you want it, it's yours
It's free, but of course
Take a high ride
I say, "J, you're the boss
Without you I'm lost
You're my sunshine."

[Bridge]
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, take me to the park
Buy me a hot dog, kiss me in the dark, dark
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, take me to the park
Buy me cotton candy, kiss me in the dark

[Verse 4]
I say, "Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
Hey, I like your heavy metal
Do you like mine?”
I said, "Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
You were smashing from the get-go
This is your time"

[Chorus]
If you want it, it's yours
It's free, but of course
Take a high ride
I say, "J, you're the boss
Without you I'm lost
You're my sunshine”

[Bridge]
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, take me to the park
Buy pink cotton candy and kiss me in the dark, dark
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, take me to the park
Buy me something pretty and kiss me in the dark

[Outro]
Jimmy Gnecco, Jimmy Gnecco, Jimmy Gnecco
You are so fine

[Intro]
Yeah, you need to turn this up
All the ladies report to the dance floor
Yeah, it's just you and me
Feel that?
You know what's gonna happen once I get you over here you, right?
You scared, yeah

[Verse 1]
Baby, I can't wait to get you up in my room
Baby, first, let me go and set up the mood
Now, I'm gon’ do you up and then I'm gon’ do you down
I'm gon’ have that body, baby, floating all around
And all you gotta do is get close to me
Bring it all to me, it's going down

[Chorus]
We ain't having sex, we're making moments that will outlast the world
And this ain't sex, this is the symbol of the true makings in love
I'm open all night
Oh, baby, oh, look at what you're doing to me
Makes me believe
I'm not blind, I see everything you giving to me
Oh, baby

[Bridge]
This is love, this is real, this is how you make me feel
This is love, this is real, this is how you make me feel

[Verse 2]
Baby, I can't wait to deliver you
(Like a FedEx box, baby girl, sign your own name)
Baby, I can't wait to remember you
(Can I make the first phone call on your birthday?)
How I did you up and then how I did you down
Yeah, I had that pretty body floating all around
Thinking back to when you were close to me
And I thought that we would never come down

[Chorus]
We ain't having sex, we're making moments that will outlast the world
And this ain't sex, this is the symbol of the true makings in love
I'm open all night
Oh, baby, oh, look at what you did to me
Make me a believer
I'm not blind, I see everything you giving to me
Ah, babe
Ooh, baby

[Bridge]
Feels so good, I can't get carried away
Need to stop and think before it's too late
I can't, it feels so good inside
I guess we'll turn this moment into a lifetime
Cut loose, bring it back, bring it back

[Chorus]
We ain't having sex, we're making moments that will outlast the world
And this ain't sex, this is the symbol of the true makings in love

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
I'm in a real Dually, My life a real movie
Your girlfriend want to change her heart she is a real groupie
I'm rockin' real diamonds, you rockin' real 

[?]
And this is not a water gun this is a real Uzi

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got more motherfucking money than a preacher, ho
I'm like a million dollars richer than a week ago
Got so much jewelry on I look just like a jewelry store
If you a bad bitch, why you wearing sneakers for?
You say your ballin', what you sittin' in the bleachers for?
Rolls Royce a head shot but my charger is a body blow
If you don't suck it right, then I guess got to teach the ho
I'm smoking swishers not the same shit Wiz Khalifa smoke

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm smoking real gas, spend money real fast
Lil' momma sexy but I wonder if that’s a real ass
I want her real bad, I got a real bag
I got it on with a long way I got that real cash
I roll with real niggas, I'm talking real killas'
And I suggest you stay in line we got bad tempers
I'm rockin' real Prada, I'm rocking real Louie
These other suckas' out here imposters, I'm the real Gucci

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
This is a one stop shop selling weed, mollies, xans
Steal from me I'm killing all close friends
He smoking dope out of chicken bones and soda cans
Clayton county that’s gangland
My shooters they got shooters man
He wanna rob better change his plans, when they run in his house everybody backin' out and they shooting man
If you want the pounds I’m in Riverdale i'm out here send 100 bands, on 85 that's real shit, flex to much get your dome kicked
Can't stand a lame and a broke bitch
It ain't hard to tell nigga' I'm the man
Can't fuck with soldiers or middle man
So I'm a boss nigga, I do boss shit
Like a GD I'm a boss bitch, hanging out the window with a chopstick
Got leather gloves with no mask, when I hit a lick
Just to let you know who took your shit
You lame as hell you a free pick, my young niggas they'll murk your ass for a half a brick
Need to rob that's my 

[?]

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm smoking real gas, spend money real fast
Lil' momma sexy but I wonder if that’s a real ass
I want her real bad, I got a real bag
I got it on with a long way I got that real cash
I roll with real niggas, I'm talking real killas'
And I suggest you stay in line we got bad tempers
I'm rockin' real Prada, I'm rocking real Louie
These other suckas' out here imposters, I'm the real Gucci
You have this way of making me
Say the opposite of everything I mean
I kiss you, I hug you
But I could not feel less connected from you

[Chorus]
I know I wanted
All this in the beginning, I really tried
I know I caught you
At a not-so-happy time of your life
My dreams are bigger than your junky pride

I don’t quite fit the part of
She who loses everything and falls into insanity
The sun beams mean nothing
If you can’t find the light shining in one thing

[Chorus]

It’s fine if you’re hateful
As long as all-in-all you remain grateful
It made me nervous to know you didn't like me
I really tried
The way I’m feeling in this moment
It can’t last my whole life
My dreams are bigger than your junky pride

[Verse 1]
I need someone that I'll look to
In the lonely hour
That we all go through
To give me comfort
And love me through
In the lonely hour
I need you
I need you
I need you

[Chorus]
I don't need diamonds
I don't need jewels
No amount of riches will cover up these blues
I don't need suggestions on how to start anew
In the lonely hour I need you
There's nothing I can do
I'm hopeless without you

[Verse 2]
It's a lonesome point of view
And there's a wistful silence in an empty room
These other voices they don't cut through
In the lonely hour I need you
I need you
And I need you
I need someone that I'll look to
In the lonely hour I need you
I need you
I would be you, you would be me, we would be one, we would be just fine
The ice caps wouldn't be melting and neither would I
I would just drive my big old car, and everything would be alright
And energy would just fall down right from the sky, yeah

Words would fly right from out of my mind, out of my mind into your heart, into your life
And everything would sound just right, and no one would stop me from drinking my wine

That's my dreamworld, that's my dreamworld, it's more than a dream
My dreamworld, that's my dreamworld, and I wanna live in my dream, (dream)

For the real world just don't feel right
I wouldn't spend my days searching for, searching for lost time (ooh ooh, dream)
I wouldn't be so damn sensitive, I'd let things go by
No matter what the weather, I'd learn to change, I'd change with the time, yeah he

And every time I need a woman, she'd appear right by me
She hold me tight, treat me right, and tell me that everything is gonna be, is gonna be alright, alright

That's my dreamworld, that's my dreamworld
I would tell Van Gogh that he was loved, there's no need to cry
I would say Marvin Gaye your father didn't want you to die (dream)
There would be no black and white, the world just treat my wife right
We could walk down in Mississipi and no one would look at us twice
That's my dreamworld, that's my dreamworld, it's more than a dream
That's my dreamworld, that's my dreamworld, and I wanna live in my dream

[Verse 1]
Little bits and pieces fall into the corners
Box of broken laces, lined up in an order
I'll do what you tell me, we can have it your way
I'll tell you the future, you tell me your story

[Chorus]
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang

[Verse 2]
Smiles from a stranger, seem to change your day when
You were just about to go and throw your towel in
Lately I've been thinking about making changes
It's been on my mind for some time and I'm anxious

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Scowling like the sunshine, set on Sarasota
Happy like a twister over Oklahoma
Clear as Penny Mason lying in a coma
This is how I feel when all my hurt is over

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Meet me in the morning, wrap your arms around me
Tell me that it's over, now that you have found me
Walk me to the river, see the willow bowing
Carry me into the water, now we're drowning

[Chorus]
We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
We're going to go home again
You didn’t think about anyone else
You didn’t think about any of us when you left that place
You didn’t wanna go anywhere else
Nothing could satisfy you 'til you left
So you went away

Where'd you go?
Where are you now?
I ask about, so many of my friends
Oh, about their ends
What about us?
Are we just dust on the floor again?
I thought we were on the mend

You really put me in quite a position
You got me struggling as a musician with a song
You like to write about all of your problems
Put them in songs because you think it would solve them
But you’re wrong

Why did you go?
I guess I know
Maybe my question is, why must it come to this?
You talk about being strong, yeah
And how I want to be you and your melody
Trying to learn about something important
But you keep taking up space, you’re annoying
But I love you so
Yeah, you already know

They're trying to teach me about new ways of living
They’re trying to teach me about ways of forgiving
But you make it hard
You’re such a bad, bad boy

I love you anyway
No matter what they say
You are not a prude, but you are on the move
I care about how this turns out
It’s just more than I ever knew how to fight
I guess I won't

Tell me I have to, tell me I have to
I know you could
I said I know you could
Where are you now?
I ask about
You have a right to live your life
Like no one else does, like no one else might
If you have visions, come on and live them out

All you need is some peace while you are here
Just let go until you are home, dear

I had a dream when I was young
I dreamt our lives were going to be fun
We were always waiting to live

All you need is some peace while you are here
Just let go of it all, dear

You have a choice to hear the noise
Or hear the sweet sound of your sweet voice
I know I've heard it, I heard it in my sleep

All you need is some peace while you are here
Just let go, don't say no, dear
Wake up each night at the same time
Roll up the blind and look outside
And in the orange light, the fog is rising

This is life, this tonight, peace in the quiet
Happiness is the sky
What an unusual name, you said
What a spectacular redhead
You really seem like a prize to me
And you are so mysterious
When you are not delirious
Oh what you mean to me

And she said, how do you know me so well
After only one night?
How do I love you, tell me
With all of my might

I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you
Always

There's something she doesn't know about
A secret he doesn't show about
A sensitive side all his own, oh my
She got her skeletons as well
Some secrets he know she'd never tell
People who keep her alone
And she said
"How did I know you so well, why am I not surprised?"
He said, "Baby, go to hell."
And that was the demise of their love

Don't ever pick up a man if you don't think he'll understand
Don't ever trust yourself if you have a history of being a loving fool

So that's what she got when she married him
A lifetime promise to carry him
Him and his every second of need
I do not know you so well
Not more than that one night
Do you still love me, oh tell me
With all of your might?

I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you, my love
Pretty baby, if you don’t like the way that I touch you
Then I won’t touch you no more, yeah
Pretty baby if you don’t like the way that I love you
Then throw my love on the floor

[Chorus]
My mean daddy, my bad baby
Don’t you want me?
I don’t believe you when you say
You want to leave

Darling, honey, if you don’t think that you're gonna want me
Then, honey, let me know
Listen, honey, I don’t wanna keep thinking you love me
Just to find out you don’t

[Chorus]

Aren't you gonna miss me?
Honey, I’ll miss you
I just wanna kiss you, tonight
Pretty baby, if you don’t like the way that I hold you
Then, honey, let me go
Pretty baby, if you don’t like the way that I told you
Then, baby, tell me so

[Chorus]
Snow is coming down like rain
I'm at it myself again
A little tired, even more confused

Come on, baby, don't be shy
You can say what make you high
I see the way you be lying, be abused

I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, don't you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
I don't care what you think

Breathing getting fast again
Now I'll start my worrying
When will I learn that there ain’t nothing I can do?

Jesus was a dying man
If he can't do it, no one can
When will you learn that we ain't nothing without you?
We don't need anybody when we're down
We don't really find it hard to get around
We'll find our own way back to town
And oh, don't you tell us how we need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
We don't, we don't care what you think

I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, don't you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody but me
And I don't care what you think
Wait a little longer kid
What you want to grow up so fast for?
Why you doing like I did?
Didn't you say I got what I asked for?

But you're afraid to find out
Like me and climb out
But you're always close to me
You got a different story
It's the same damn thing
Got a long way, rest your feet
I know you can do anything

You were such a handsome boy
Don't you give up your glory
Why you want to hit them streets?
Didn't you never hear my story?

And it's fine to waste time
But you got a beautiful mind
And you're always close to me
You're a different kid
But it's the same damn thing
And it's a long way, you better rest your feet
I know that you want everything
That's what you told me
I still believe you
I still see it's true
I need you and I know you, dear
But if you've gotta make it then
I can take it from here

Wait a little longer kid
Didn't I never say I would miss you?
Don't go until I come home
Please don't go until I kiss you

And it's hard to grow up
But we all know it's tough
Yeah, you're always close to me
You have a different story
It's the same damn thing
You got a long way, c'mon and rest your feet
I know you can do anything

[Verse 1]
Little boy
Living without you won't be easy to do
Little boy
You are the love of my life
And if you don't wanna talk to me
Well, then I think that's alright

[Chorus]
Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
My love

[Verse 2]
Knowing you are hurt inside
I think of all your happy times
Oh, my
When I ask what I can do
You say remember me the way I was six months ago, oh
I could do so much more for you, y'know
I could make you well if you just asked me to
Oh

[Bridge]
Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
I'll do anything
For you or for him
Or whoever else needs some help out there
I swear, I swear

[Chorus]
Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
Always

[Verse 3]
Think of you on quiet nights
At traffic lights and
Every highway and
I get a little scared sometimes when
Everyone I meet I find has
A friend

[Chorus]
Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
My love

[Verse 1]
I top every mountain there's a hurdle in the sky
When at last you've found them you will understand as I
There is no solution
Life is without resolution

[Chorus 1]
You must ask yourself what you really want in life
You must trust in me when I tell you it's alright
It's alright tonight
It's alright tonight

[Verse 2]
I remember New Year's that your everything seemed right
We had not made plans and we just drove all the whole night
Let's all go find a friend
Don't stop until the end

[Bridge]
You must ask yourself, am I really the one?
You can't be of help if you can't have any fun
I'm your one if you want me to be
Please leave me be
Who are you to say a soul won't live forever
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Atop every mountain there's a hurdle in the sky
When at last you've found them you will understand as I
Each breath is sent from angels
These people, they are not strangers

[Chorus]
You must ask yourself what you really want in life
You must trust in me when I tell you it's alright
It's alright tonight
It's alright tonight
Well, dark clouds they'll subside for awhile
And sit down, I can make my friends smile
I have lost a lot but I'm sane, you know
And I'm calling you up just to say hello, so
Hi, my lovely, hi, my lovely
I am someone else

I did think I would live life alone
I was sure I was made out of stone
I have lost a lot but you helped me find
What was really real and some peace of mind
And I'm awfully thankful and I am so grateful
I need no one else

Will you think of me when I am gone?
Will you comfort me when I am wrong?
I have a lost a lot but I'm feeling fine cause I
Finally found out nothing's mine and I'm
Only human, I'm so human
I am nothing else

[Chorus]
Hey, stranger, my strange love
Would you be mine?
Am I what you're dreaming of?
Hey, stranger, my strange love
What makes you shine?
What makes you fall in love?

[Verse 1]
It's strange the way we met
A desert road and then
My car had stopped and you pulled up
On your black motorcycle
You rode me to the bar
We danced all night under
The Christmas lights and the dark black night
With the lightning and the thunder

[Chorus]
Hey, stranger, my strange love
Would you be mine?
Am I what you're dreaming of?
Hey, stranger, my strange love
What makes you shine?
What makes you fall in love?

[Verse 2]
You took me to the edge of town
That's where you slept
You liked it best when no one else
Could find you or could bother
You poured us mint juleps
And kissed me the lips
You held me tight in the TV light
And you said you never loved her

[Bridge]
You have a dark heart, like mine
Things that you've seen in done time
Let me love you, let me touch you
Let me show you, you'll be fine

[Chorus]
Hey, stranger, my strange love
Would you be mine?
Am I what you're dreaming of?
Hey, stranger, my strange love
What makes you shine?
What makes you fall in love?

[Outro]
You have a dark heart, like mine

[Verse 1]
Platinum and vale acrylics
Skim the paper for the critics
Baby's breathing Elvis lyrics
On the copper bar
Late in motel lounges singing
Spotlight on the band is swinging
Chateau Marmont memories fading
Hope is very far

[Chorus]
Elvis, where are you when I need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my chantilly lace catching
Baby, on the chandelier

[Verse 2]
Sweeping scents and blue hydrangea
Summer hail and summer stranger
Baby, he's in constant danger
Help is very far
You look like a Florida native
"Are you?" I said, at the rate of
Slow molasses from the state of
Vermont with a Southern drawl

[Chorus]
Elvis, where are you when I need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my chantilly lace is catching
On the chandelier

[Bridge]
He said he'd come to welcome, warn me
Just your diamond to adorn me
Come to be and see the one and only
For my final year
Well, thank you

[Chorus]
Elvis, where are you when I need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my chantilly lace is catching
On the chandelier
It's catching on that chandelier
It's catching on that chandelier
Where are you when I need you most?

[Verse 1]
All dressed up, with nowhere to go
That's the story of the girl you know
Me
I'm all smiles but inside I frown
Cause I've seen you walkin' around with Betty Lou
Didn't I tell you what I heard about her?

[Chorus 1]
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you what them other girls do
You'll date anyone, you'll date anyone

[Verse 2]
Are they more fun than me, baby?
I'm smiling, the New Jersey queen
And you're the best thing I ever seen
So won't you pull up your white corvette
Jimmy, let me get a better look at your face
I know it ain't doing
But I know what you like
So come on inside and I'll fix you ice-cream
A little banana split for you, Jim

[Verse 3]
You're so fine, you're like silk la roux
Guess that's why you keep slipping through my fingers
You're the state's number one
Everybody knows it
You smile all the time
Cause how can you not show it
When even you know
That you're so
To die for, to die for
What do I need to get high for?
When I have you
When I have you

[Chorus 2]
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you what those other girls done
I'm gonna prove to you
I'm gonna prove to you
You'll never find nobody more fun
Dah, dah, dah
More fun

[Verse 1]
Tell her that you love her
If you really love her
But if your heart just ain't sure
Let her know

[Verse 2]
Growing by the hour
Love just like a flower
But when the flower dies
You've got to say goodbye
And let her go

[Chorus]
Let her go
Let her go

[Verse 3]
Tell her that you'll be there
If you'll really be there
Separation's supposed to
Make the heart grow fond
But it don't

[Verse 4]
So tell her that you love her
If you really love her
But if your heart just ain't sure
Let her go

[Chorus]
Let her go
Let her go
Let her go
Let her go
Yeah!

[Spoken]
Or you can keep her
It's okay
It's up to you
Make your own choice
But you got it
God bless

[Verse 1]
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talking so brave and so sweet
Giving me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the street
But those were the reasons and that was New York
We were running for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left

[Chorus]
Ah, but you got away, didn't you baby?
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

[Verse 2]
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said, "Well, never mind
We are ugly, but we have the music."

[Chorus]
Ah, but you got away, didn't you baby?
You just turned your back on the crowd
And you got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

[Verse 3]
I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
I can't keep track of each fallen robin
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
That's all, I don't even think of you that often

[Intro]
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1]
They say I'm too young to love you
I don't know what I need
They think I don't understand
The freedom land of the seventies
I think I'm too cool to know ya
You say I'm like the ice, I freeze
I'm churning out novels like
Beat poetry on amphetamines

[Pre-Chorus]
I say
I say

[Chorus]
Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Post-Chorus]
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-ya-da
Pa-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 2]
They say I'm too young to love you
They say I'm too dumb to see
They judge me like a picture book
By the colors, like they forgot to read
I think we're like fire and water
I think we're like the wind and sea
You're burning up, I'm cooling down
You're up, I'm down
You're blind, I see

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm free, ooh
I'm free

[Chorus]
Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Bridge]
I'm talking 'bout my generation
Talking 'bout my newer nation
And if you don't like it, you can beat it
Beat it, baby
You never liked the way I said it
If you don't get it, then forget it
'Cause I don't have to fucking explain it

[Chorus]
And my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get high on hydroponic weed
And my jazz collection's rare
I get down to Beat poetry
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Post-Chorus]
Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-de-da
Te-de-de, da-da-ah
Ooh, oh, woah-ah

[Chorus]
Yeah, my boyfriend's pretty cool
But he's not as cool as me
'Cause I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Outro]
Pa-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da, baby
Ah-ta-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, baby
Pa-da-da-da-da-da
Pa-pa-da-pa-da, yeah
Yeah, yeah
I wanted to give all of my fans something extra because this album was so special to me. And it came so effortlessly after I finished the film of my life, "Dreamgirls". Because I was so inspired by Deena, I wrote songs that were saying all the things I wish she would have said in the film. And I wanted to give you an extra special song that Deena sings. It's a pivotal moment when Deena finally does get the strength to stand up for herself and does know who she is and knows what she wants. I'm sure all of you women can relate to the lyrics. This is "Listen"...

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
If you need somebody say "Yeah yeah"
And if she love somebody, say "Hell yeah"

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I can't even lie, baby girl you super cool
And I got a crush on you just like first day of school
Every time I bought some shoes, I bought your ass some shoes
Every time I bought some Trues, you got a pair of Trues
And you left me by myself, now girl I'm so confused
Tell me why you do the things, you do the things you do
I like the way you walking when you walk, the way you move
Ain't no secret 'bout it baby, that's what made me choose
One girl ain't enough for me but fuck that shit, I'm straightenin' up
Them bitches know shit 'bout me, them hoes just wanna break us up
Come on girl, let's fall in love cause I'm so tired of being tough
This might be beginners luck and I don't wanna fuck it up
I'mma get your hair fixed baby just so I can mess it up
Grab that skirt when you get off of work so we can dress it up
I'mma be here thick and thin and God gon' keep on testing us
I said I wouldn't do it again but I just keep on messin' up

[Chorus: Young Thug]
If you need somebody, say "Yeah yeah"
And if she love somebody, say "Hell yeah"
If you got somebody, say "Yeah yeah"
But if you love that nigga, say "Hell yeah"
I wanna know, I wanna know if you gonna say "Yeah yeah"

But if you really love that bitch, say "Hell yeah"

The challenges we faces on the world is this
The banks are telling government to do that & do this
No ones taking a truth risk, no ones the looser
We need to make trades with Cuba
Open up the borders all away to Aruba
Give taxes brakes to all teachers and tutors
But Cats don't like how the teachers be talking
Cause cats don't walk where the teacher be walking
(L)ove (A)nd (D)evelop (Y)ourself, that spells L.A.D.Y
I teach it to young girls and women go crazy!
Philosopher, criticism don't phase me
I walk in the truth even the wind obey me
Standing with a protest sign FREE HAITI!
My rhymes blows your mind like «A380» (Explosion)
I made a million dollars last year didn't change me
I Make money man, the money does not make me
Lately my popularity just heighten, cause Krs-One Enlightens!

It ain't about stupid white man with Blacks, Latinos & Asians just act just like them!

Illuminati this!, Bilderberg that!
The White, how long «the dollar» goes way back
If the proof mask the truth, the truth i say that
So the TRUTH is that we in a debt that we can never pay back
So «..The balance the budget..» we can never say that
When the laws are on the flaws the justices lays back
It's the May! Back though, that given us hope
When the «Mercedes Corporation» is trying to stay up float
The whole things a JOKE! & FALLEN PART!
The Only Institution you can really trust is ART
AND WITH ART(Backspin Instrumental, Krs Still Emceeing)

You can start up a Civilization
We're already Worldwide Man! so WHY are WE! Waiting!
Hip-Hop! is THE SPOT where the money be making!
& If We UNITE TONIGHT, WE can start up a NATION
Get Free From The GREED In The Heart Of This Nation
& Create Our OWN NATION from the words that I'm Stating
Hip-Hop MAKE NOSE if you part of this nation & you ain't Gettin' Sucked in the GLOBALIZATION!!!!!!!

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci
Burrr

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
30 inches on the truck, nigga, no rub
And I don't give these cocksuckers no love
I'm double cupped up, nigga, straight mud
So, your first impression is a nigga sell drugs
I got ball player money, I be pieced up
And if you gettin' money, nigga, we can link up
I might pull up to the club in a Brinks truck
I'm smoking out the pound bag, nigga, straight bud

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Loose leaves, fuck the shoestrings, let the bitches hang
I'm just a East Atlanta nigga, spend this East Atlanta game
Make a girl sprain her ankle when she see my chain blang
I wear so many diamond necklaces, her head turn like the exorcist
Just came back from Texas, I just re-upped with the Mexicans
Ran off on the plug, all while I delete all his messages
Gucci Man, the glacier I started out as flexin' shit
Bells of Kush and bells of purp, man two different addresses
This white shit that I'm sellin' will make you go turn on your relatives
Fuck your block, come shop with me, you know I got them better deals
Kush so strong, gotta smoke it in the restroom
Niggas say they got that gas, well Gucci got that jet fuel

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
30 inches on the truck, nigga, no rub
And I don't give these cocksuckers no love
I'm double cupped up, nigga, straight mud
So, your first impression is a nigga sell drugs
I got ball player money, I be pieced up
And if you gettin' money, nigga, we can link up
I might pull up to the club in a Brinks truck
I'm smoking out the pound bag, nigga, straight bud

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I put fours on the coupe, they said they wouldn't fit
And I drop 30's on the truck, they say the same shit
Told 'em 30 for a brick, they say I'm insane
But it's a drought and they Gucci say the same thing
All I rock is 'Sace, 600 for a T-Shirt
I got 30 on my hip, extended clip, that how the heat work
Cold-ass niggas, they should call a nigga A-C
Got these niggas hot cause I dropped Freon in my A-P
Froze!
And when it come to hoes, yeah, I got 'em
And he was playin' games with that chain, so I shot 'em
Gotti! Realest nigga in it, don't you doubt 'em
400 for that 'Rari, bitch, I'mma jump up out 'em

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
30 inches on the truck, nigga, no rub
And I don't give these cocksuckers no love
I'm double cupped up, nigga, straight mud
So, your first impression is a nigga sell drugs
I got ball player money, I be pieced up

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
It's Guwop, what's happening baby, what's going on?

She been working all day, working all week
She wanna freak with me
Ain't no problem cause I'm not cheap
I got money all week I give her
I got the money, I'll buy somethin'
Call your friend, let's try somethin'
She like girls and boys, so she trisexual
She eat pussy, don't eat vegetables
That ass fat, it irregular
Is it an ass shot, or did God bless her?
She a bad student on the 10th semester
But she give good head like the damn professor
Red bottom pumps like Cinderella
Red bottom pumps like Cinderella
Butt naked on some damn suspenders
Ain't gotta catch her out to impress her
Gucci Man, I'm getting money, got bad bitches on my itinerary
Born on the 12th of February
12 diamond chains and they all canary
And you're not a virgin, so don't act scary
Cause I'm not the one to bust your cherry
It's Gucci Man and I hip-hop
But I smoke guap like I got dreadlocks

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I ain't really have a paper problem
M-P-A in the building, I pay for it
I ain't really have a paper problem
If you workin' overnight then I stay for it
I ain't really have a paper problem
If I really, really, like it, I wait for it
I ain't really have a paper problem
I turn into a Christian like Ma$e for it
I ain't really have a paper problem
I ain't really have a paper problem
I ain't really have a paper problem
I ain't really have a paper problem

[Verse 2: Peewee Longway]
I ain't really have a paper problem
Rock this shit the long way I'm talkin' about U.S. currency
Hell yea, I give you two hunna, give your ass three
Just to make this shit a guarantee
Payin' for the pussy ain't a problem
Bitch, you finna get a beatin gone off the seeds and molly
I ain't really have a paper problem

[Intro:]
Ice Cream Man Gucci
Brick Squad's finest

[Verse 1:]
I got a trap house, time to check my crack house
I got a lean house, I got a stash house
It's right next to my juug house
My baby mama moved out
My ex-girl kicked me out
I still pass bricks out
Zone 6, I got my middle finger up, screamin' fuck a hater
I put my money on a motherfuckin' escalator
And I'm up like I'm in a fuckin' elevator
Sixes on my Charger, sittin' like a skyscraper
Hi hater! Wave at ya as I fly by
I'mma fly ass nigga since the junior high
You a lie, say you see me in some Levi's
Got these number nine J's and I'm too live
Going down in this motherfucker
I'm a rich motherfucker, I don't wear Chuckers
I don't do nothing, just got a 40 Cal
I'm in the Louis Vuitton store signing autographs
It's Guwop

[Hook:]
I'm talking cash shit, I'm talking cash shit
They say I'm feeling myself, feeling myself, feeling myself, bitch
I'm talking cash shit, I'm talking cash shit
They say I'm feeling myself, feeling myself, feeling myself
I'm a millionaire, yeah, yeah, I'm a millionaire, yeah, yeah
Say I'm a millionaire, yeah, yeah
Guwop

[Verse 2:]
I'm a millionaire, got millionaire friends
And a millionaire Benz, I'm a millionaire trend
Million dollar matching nigga, Gucci Man going in
Million dollar haircut, million dollar grin
When I walk in - you can't hear the wind
Blowin' money in the wind, screamin' fuck a friend
Found a pen, Rumpelstiltskin
You don't like Gucci? Fuck your opinion
A bad bitch in lingerie playing pig skin
I'm 4th and and long and you niggas 3rd and inches
I stick it, make a Saturday outta Wednesday
Black cat pulled up, she superstitious
It's Gucci

[Hook:]

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Baby keep me on my P's, let's break down a hundred P's
Gucci gas go thirty-three, but gotta get thirty P
I don't even need a reason to hit you with the heat
These shoes don't come out this season, but still they on my feet

[Verse 2: Peewee Longway]
Old folk keep calling us heathens
Too many drugs on the street
I'm servin' right there by Four Seasons
Niggas from the pen won't weep

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Peewee got the bricks and the bales
Listen up to the story I tell
The bricks, they came from the mail
My plug, his name is Miguel

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
I'm in the kitchen, counting up Benjis
Your bitch washing dishes and wrappin' up fishes
Used to run from the cops on the block
Hit for a hot box, took it to the chop shop
If I fuck with you, I'm making you straight drop
If I don't know you, I'ma give you rerock
Got a bando in Boston
The way I pitch them eight-balls, shoulda played for the Red Sox

[Verse 5: MPA Wicced]
Just took a loss, 'bout to take somethin' off
Put it to her head, make her open up the vault
Say you got birds hid all in the loft
Soon as you turn the key, boy, you 'bout to get off

[Verse 6: Lil Duke]
Bought a brand new AP
But I'm always late
Every day my birthday
Now watch me bake a cake

[Verse 7: Takeoff]
I finesse the plug for the drugs
Even though a nigga always show love
If he ain't Migo, he ain't MPA
Brick Squad, nigga, you ain't my blood
Tryna hit my blunt, tryna sip my drank
What the fuck you think?
Ain't shit soft around my way
Unless you talkin' 'bout cocaine

[Spoken Word]
God
Come in, God
God, come in, God
Damn, you're a girl? Wow
I guess the reason I'm talkin' to you tonight is
Because I've been doin' a lot of thinkin' and
And I consider myself a pretty cool guy
And I've never cheated on any of my girlfriends
Well, well, except that one little time in Japan, but
That was just some head, and head don't count, right?
Ah, thanks God, I knew you'd understand
Well, I just feel like
Well, to be honest with you
God, I just need a sweet bitch
You know somebody not too
Not too fast, but not too slow
'Cause I don't have it all my damn self
And life ain't easy
You know, you just want somebody by your side
To help smooth that thang out, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
And at this point, I mean, I'm not bein' picky
She doesn't even have to have a big ol' ass, you know?
Just something well proportioned to her body
You know, a nice little tail, you know?
What? You say you, you say you found somebody?
Is she cute? So when do I get to meet her?
Oh God, you're the greatest
Well, I guess I'll talk to you later
Amen
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
A-lady

[Verse 1]
I'm cryin' everyone's tears
And they're inside our private war I died the night before
And all of these remnants of joy and disaster
What am I supposed to do?
I want to cook you a soup that warms your soul
But nothin' would change, nothin' would change at all
It's just a day that brings it all about
Just another day and nothin's any good

[Chorus]
The D.J's playin' the same song
I have so much to do, I have to carry on
I wonder if this grief will ever let me go
I feel like I am the King of Sorrow
The King of Sorrow

[Verse 2]
I suppose I could just walk away
Will I disappoint my future if I stay?
It's just a day that brings it all about
Just another day and nothin's any good

[Chorus]
The D.J's playin' the same song
I have so much to do, I have to carry on
I wonder will this grief ever be gone
Will it ever go?
I'm the King of Sorrow
The King of Sorrow

[Verse 3]
I'm cryin' everyone's tears
I have already paid for all my future sins
There's nothing anyone can say to take this away
It's just another day and nothin's any good

[Outro]
I'm the King of Sorrow
King of Sorrow
King of Sorrow
King of Sorrow
Sorrow
King of Sorrow

Time to pull those toys out man skrr
Let's do it

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Hey where the party at? Let's go, let's ride, Let's roll
Yeah, everywhere I go them girls follow, na, na, na, na
Let everybody know that I'm here tonight, as soon as I walk in the door
Hey, pretty lady I think I need you in my life, in fact I know I need you for sure

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Tonight might be the night
You might mess around and fall in love
And then I might be the guy
That'll make you want to fall in love again
Girl, what's your name? Happy that you came
I'm the man in this, stick with me, you can't lose
Looking everywhere around the world, don't you know, girl that
I'll be looking for you

[Chorus: Quavo]
Is it her? Lookin' for you, lookin' for you
I'm not paparazzi or a stalker
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you
Not the feds or a cop

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I got money in my pocket and I ain't afraid to spend it
Ain't a problem baby girl, when you’re winning
Tell me what you wanna do, we can make a move now
Girl you ain't gotta fight the feelin', tell me why you grinning
I think you're likin' what I'm sayin'
Do I really gotta say any more?
You need to know that I ain't playin'
Baby what are we waitin' for?

Tonight might be the night
You might mess around and fall in love
And then I might be the guy

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Bad bitches in the party, alcohol on me
Tell the waitress put the sparklers on my 20 PTs (lean!)
I asked her what's her name, got to know she said Hannah
On the way to the mansion, said she loved the Panamera
In the trap with J. Bieber with my phone chirpin' like beepers
Mona Lisa, Anna Mae is in the pot when I beat her
Take her 'cross the country, I got plugs on the Visa
Cut your man off little mama, you don't need him

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Yeen never seen a nigga like me
Hopping out, Giussepe steppin' with a mink, gold chain, Mr. T
In the summer, in a V12 Hummer with the leather seats
Would tell you 'bout my mansion but I think they watchin' me
I'm a vegetarian
All I want is some lettuce and some broccoli
Mansion out in Beverly
Yo bitch call me call me "Your Majesty"

[Verse 5: Offset]
My bitch is so gorgeous, I might pay her mortgage
I run to the money like Forrest
My life is historic
Travel 'round the world like I'm in orbit
I take your bitch and dunk her like Ben Gordon
I watch her like a telescope
I beat it and kill it like I'm Lil TerRio
I got your bitch, she watchin' me like Tyler Perry shows
I'm young and I'm rich, ridin' in a Phantom Ghost
I paint a picture for niggas like Michelangelo

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Tonight might be the night
You might mess around and fall in love
And then I might be the guy
That'll make you want to fall in love again
Girl, what's your name? Happy that you came
I'm the man in this, stick with me, you can't lose
Looking everywhere around the world, don't you know, girl that
I'll be looking for you

[Chorus: Quavo]
Is it her? Lookin' for you, lookin' for you
I'm not paparazzi or a stalker
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you
Not the feds or a cop
Lyrics from Snippets

[Verse]
I hear the girls scream soon as we arrivin'
You can ask Ibn, we be straight mackin'
Y'all work at IBM, hotels they be in
Ooh la la, tres bien magnifique
Any street, life before this is hard…
…
Now he on a sandy beach
Mix 

[?], sandy peach
Mixed bitch, and she a freak
Ooh la, oui oui, I'm like…
…
If you talkin' 'bout marriage, you mean multi-million heiress
…
Father is the black Bruce Wayne
Only shorty in preschool rockin' two chains
Tellin' them lil' niggas he is not the same, not the same (Not the same)

[Verse 1]
Cherry says that anytime
I think I have a good idea
That I should do the opposite
Of whatever it is I feel
And that’s because I have a bad mind
And I have gold in my veins
But he says I got the purest heart
That he’s ever seen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What'd God give me a brain for?
He won’t help me use it
What'd God give me a plan for
If he won’t help me do it?

[Chorus]
You’re gonna love me
I’m gonna make you
You’re gonna love me
I’m gonna make you

[Verse 2]
Well I can tell that you’re the type
To never trust a beauty queen
But I was never voted for nothing
And high school never meaned
Anything to anybody
Never ever gave myself away
But even when I’m funny
You think I’m acting, so I say

[Pre-Chorus 2]
What'd God give me a brain for
If he won’t let me use it?
What’d God give me a plan for?
He never helps me do it

[Chorus]
You’re gonna love me
I’m gonna make you
You’re gonna love me
I’m gonna make you

[Bridge]
You say that you don’t want to be hypnotized
But baby I, I don’t want to hypnotize you
There’s nothing from you that I want to take
I just want to be like you
(Maybe love you just a little bit)
Please

[Verse 3]
Jim, I'mma dedicate this whole album to you
You told me to get my way
That’s exactly what I’m gonna do
I’m going to strike out, right now
I’m striking out right now with this song
But I can’t help myself;
I can’t do right for long
You know that

[Pre-Chorus 3]
What God give me a brain for?
He knows that I can't use it
I don't know why he'd give me a plan for
He never lets me do it

[Chorus]
You’re gonna love me
I’m gonna make you
You’re gonna love me
I’m gonna make you
I think we're losing what we used to have, you know
You loved me better one year ago, oh
Don't let me down, don't let me down so low

But I won't be ashamed if you leave me
I won't be all that mad if you go
'Cause I know, yes I know

You always spending all that stupid time
With your band on the road
But your band is all the rage
So I've been told
But you can still come home
You can still come home when you want

And I won't be ashamed to take you back in
Won't be ashamed to put a kiss on your lips
'Cause I know, I know

Boy, don't call me up quickly on the phone
It's been five nights since I heard the tone of your voice
You act like everything's alright
But we both know, we both know that it's not
And it's far from ever being good again
Darlin', I'm gonna love you forever
If you come back, I'll take you back in baby
Back in, baby, back in, back in
I love you more than I will even know
You're so special
I guess that's why you got it where you go
But when you get real big, baby
Remember that little old cowgirl
Waiting for you back in that Red River Valley
Waiting back in that Tallahassee
I love you

These niggas playin games, now they got me fed up

[Hook]
Playin with the money, playin with the money
Havin money nigga, I ain't havin paper problems

[Verse 2]
It's Gucci Mane the playa, feel like Nino at the cop
Only difference bout it, I'm the East Atlanta jug
Used to get the work and the pills came from Florida
And you my protégé but I can never ride a Mazda
Hoppin doors with your main hoes, calamari pasta
In the Ferrari California, sittin on Forgiatos
And your girlfriend said she pregnant but you know you not the father
If my plug would have been a pussy, then I would have robbed him
Got them green and white Air Max 95's cause I just came from Boston
Try to follow me on I85, well fuck ya I done last ya
Amigo say don't like to fuck with blunts cause all these niggas didn't cross school
I cross the trash, ran up the set
These hoes say that I'm awesome

[Hook]

[Eminem]
Yo yo, back again
Ha-ha-ha (Agh!)
Turn it up a little bit, pick it up pick it up
Yo pick it up, pick it up
Yo pick it up
If you find a phone call in a Tim Westwood line, what the hell you gonna do?
Pick it up! Pick it up!

[Proof]
If your ball falls out with a pad on the floor, what the hell you gonna do? (Pick it up! Pick it up!)

[Eminem]
While I'm smacking up girls to keep the hoes in check
The double S-Slim Shady wreck the London set
Sit back and relax while my squad smokes crack
And tap your man back and be like (Did you see that?)
Ah yes, coming from the mother freaking Midwest
Lift your shirt up and let me see them big breasts
We molest girls three times a day, three times a night
I got G-fulls of criminal peoples
Jumping out when we ten deep
Beat you down and speed off in a Benz Jeep
Brothers be like: Eminem changed his style up!
Shut the hell up, I'm still seven miles slut!
It's '97 so get with it
Peep that back in the day stuff when that Infinite tape was hitting
Listen, must we forget
I originated all that rough shit, that talk drug shit
That left motherfuckers who said our sound like 

[?]
Detroit city is where I grew up bitch
Peace to all my Outsidaz in Jers
Forget what you heard, this is three and one third

[Proof]
If you got an STD and your penis falls on the floor (What the hell you gonna do?)
Pick it up! Pick it up! (Ahhh yeah yeah yeahhh pick it up, pick it up)
If you see a Slim Shady tape on the fucking rack
What does Dre do? (ooohhhh)
(On the uckin rack, on the uck without the f)

[Eminem]
I get deaf MCees stepped to the left
I bust MCees and my name is Wyclef
How you doing? I play the banjo, piano whatever it is I rock like Barry Manilow
Yo it's Slim Shady on the freaking deck
Y'all don't check it out I wreck the Frim Shady set
The Frim Shady is what I said because I'm freaking drunk
I pick it up, pick it up, I sound like a punk

[Proof]
Ayo they wish that they could ban me black
Yo, you standing back
Def methods, ayo got my hand in that
Who ever running it, ayo you get a jammed knee cap
Make the healthiest in your fam, handicap
You a fan of rap, my clan will tap your school, home, ya bitch house
Pull my nine millie, you gonna die with your fist out
Enemas is over with
Venomous is cobra spit
Aggressive dialect with aggressive sober pitch
My bionic phonics, demolish your logic, demonic can't stand the chronic impossible to hold on like vomit
Mics I palm it, cause they the bomb-it
Like terrorist is Islamic, I enter your atmosphere like a comet
The new god of rap, call me bigger Thor
Snap your back when I slap your ass in a figure four
From miles around they can feel us lethal
I make hardcore groups like Wu Tang sound like the village people (haha)
Be no sequel, of the energize, finish style, bust 'em down right now, the winner is... me
Then my man Mr. Paul we gonna star
Make your heart beat for your trying get down with us
We ball to the end, it's time to pretend
My friend to the left of me, the death of me
Me recipe to be with this don't even test MCees
Y'all can't get with us it's the dress, dress on ya

[Biggie smalls]
(Verse1)
Money, hoes, and clothes
Blunt smoke coming out the nose, is all a nigga knows
Flipping on foes, putting tags on toes
Watching the stash grow, clocking the cashflow
The neighborhood gravedigger
Getting paid so much, all the bitches want to see a nigga
I guess they figure I'm paid, I want to get laid
Or since I got loot, I want to knock boots
I'd rather beat my dick than trick
And if she don't suck, then we don't fuck
I'd rather make a buck, drive a fat-ass truck
Grab the 9, two clips, and run amuck
Yes, flex at the two or three Benzes
I wreck shit, what the fuck you expected?
A fly guy? Well fuck it, I'm the high guy
From Bed-Stuy, putting the swelling on your eye
And your nose even; when I choke ya, you stop breathing
And when Jake come, I'm leaving

[Biggie smalls]
(Verse2)
When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case Dread want to riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
Not your ordinary: we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad, do a quarter, flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the DA, cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rips it quick
And kicks it quick; you know how black niggas get
With the hoods, fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, making crazy G's
Hitting buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue--take my loot, and I'm bagging you
Pimping hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make her wet in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga's style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga want to act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfucking back out
That's a real nigga for ya

[2pac]
(Verse3)
Im stuck in jail the DA's tryin' to burn me
I'd be out on bail, If I had a good attorney
Wanna label me a criminal and cuff me up
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up
I ain't trippin' in the county and im mad as fuck
Got a record so they put me with the baddest bunch
Everybody wanna talk cause im rappin'
They asking me what happend
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson?
I can't sleep they taking polaroids
And im tryna' use the phone but they making noise
Man I wish I had my Glock cause its major
Im making shanks out the plastics in razors
These motherfuckers won't, leave me alone thats my word
'Bout to turn a violation to a motherfucking murder
Im making collect calls to my old bitches
Send mo' pictures, and make me some mo' riches
To all the suckers on the block, talking shit while I was locked up
Be prepared to be socked up
Cause the game is deep, and the fame is brief
And you bullshitting bitches ain't changing me
I came straight up out of gutta' I was saved from hell
Im a thug I was raised in jail, now im out on bail

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
We making movies bitch, go get ya popcorn
I was selling butter way before I got an arm
Mac eleven with a ladder in the top draw
Staring at my chain and get ya watch gone
Feeling like Tony, straight back from MIA

[?] murder any rapper in my way
No pics, leave em MIA

[?] said I 

[?] down in MIA
Rawer than a brick, harder than the cook
Party where the law at, ya niggas shook
Betta tuck ya chain homie before ya get it took

My goons ready to shoot, I'm like be cool ya niggas

[?] small money to remove ya niggas
Lookin' at my Rolly it's about that time
Time to get that money know I'm on my grind
Omelly in the kitchen bout to drop that nine
I got no love for niggas that drop that dime
I'm in the mitt, jump up out the hood to the sticks

[?] passager like Meagan Good in a whip
Riding in the trenches with the wolfs and the pit
On the way to see my OG, he good with the brick
North Philly nigga, Bird street exactly
Wrist should tell you how I'm feeling, you ain't gotta ask me
That's cold as fuck, we be rolling up
Windows smoked out, shooters loading up
Nigga rep ya set, go head throw it up
Time bomb on you niggas cause I'm blowing up
Nine-eleven, July the fourth
Flaming on these niggas, cause I got the touch

[Hook]
Straight cash, straight cash
Bitch I'm like a register
Straight cash, straight cash

Look at the jack boys, let 'em run up on 'em
And I be dumping on 'em

Glock seventeen, in my seven jeans
Do them niggas dirty, it be a bloody scene
I like my yayo white and my money green

[?]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Twenty grand, you don't understand

Let's cut the bullshit, is we fucking, man?
Somebody wake me up, swear to God I'm dreaming
Lamborghini, hundred miles an hour and I'm leaning
Banging flames too, they say my style the meanest
Swagger on 100, I got it from 

[?]
The money here, the bitches too
You need some paper, this what you do
Call my nigga up, he say sending you
You tell him "me" you pay for one and he gonna give you two
Dope boy, turned rapper now
Somebody let them haters out, I back them down
Benjamins, we count them by the pound
I was broke as a joke, but guess who's laughing now

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fuck a money machine, I'm a money machine
All my niggas they get it, yeah running the team
I ain't chasing the paper, it be running to me
Niggas talking that money shit till they run into me

Twenty a the joint? Ok we playing ball

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Heater in my tire, crack up in my draws
Watching out for Shamrock?, he trynna get us all
They want cases up, they trynna send us off
Head me upstate, working all up out the yard
Taskforce Tuesday, watch out where the cars at
Tell my youngin watch out for the molly, booze, and 

[?]
Taskforce swinging through the jungle like they Tarzan
Slowing down, staring at me like they see the market
I pulled out the stack pack trynna bring a stack back
Break it down, headed up, run through it like a 

[?]
Flip it once, flip it twice, then put it where my stash at
Tipee say he got a lick and I say where the cash at
And I'mma bring my ladder out of storage, where my men at
He say he got twenty keys and we gonna go and grab that
Interception, that's a touchdown
We was fucked up, but we up now

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 2: AR-AB]
They say money make the world spin
I'm at the Louis store, spending like a whirlwind
Put ya AR crying about a girlfriend
I'd rather get the Pyrex and drop girl in
I get straight to the pussy, no foreplay
I was sitting in jail for a short stay
Let a nigga show up on court day
I'mma show 'em the moon in broad day
AK, street sweep, no dustpan
Cut grams, play the corner like the cut man
I left school and used to hang in the hooky house
I dropped powder in water and pulled a cookie out
Big money, gotta account for three days
White girl, I make her drop like D. Wade
Purp wind, Sour D or the P Haze
I had a girl telling me I got three legs

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 3: Shizz Nitty]
The way we got them pies in, nothing with this grinding
Take it to the kitchen, find a flame and get to frying
Grab the sixty-two, got a point they grip the nine
Scratch my head, look at my man like yo we grinding
Used to play the crib, now we block it like a line
Raised from the street where them coppers wait in line
My boys ain't doing great, but they doing kinda fine
They 

[?] or they ain't, never stuck up in the line man
Heard about them niggas, how they sing like Frankie Lineman
Crying like my bitches, used to nickel now I dime shit
Niggas want me fail like the prison system jail
When we vision all whipping all till I'm in a cell
I got niggas pushing Ls, cause a nigga took an L
On the pill, hope he win, come home bringing hell
Get the orders from the kitchen then I sit it on the scale
Break it down, take the orders, then we send it like it's mail

[Hook] 2x

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
But she's a PYT (A pretty young thing)

Will.I.am non-stop
MJ on top
Our father
Who art in heaven
Please watch over me
24/7
Please give me
Something to believe in
I'm either driven or crippled by these demons
Sometimes it feels like the power I wield is a blessing and a curse
And I wanna shine up on my brothers like the sun
But when my light is gone
Change to be ugly
I wanna be happy I don't wanna hurt the ones I love
They the ones who only getting hurt the most
Please send your angels
To save me from myself

I wanna feel free
I wanna feel please
Well I can feel pleased
If I'm feeling guilty
Please forgive me
For all my sins please
And forgive them who keep sinning against me
May my enemies live long so they can see me progress
I know that my biggest enemy is me and that pain is weakness leaving my body
And if I dance with the devil in the pale moonlight it's alright
But deliver me from evil with my soul intact
And no regrets
Amen

[Verse 1]
I never been a bitch in my life, I never ran from a fight
I was told when niggas bark you should bite
And these puppies ain’t eatin' enough Pedigree to scare something
They play with the word gangster til some lead dumpin
Until the ambulance coming pressin' on they chest
Calf and stomach, you grabbin' the hand of a woman
I never took the stand, snitched on my man and came back home Like it was nothin', actin' like I ain’t do somethin' wrong
Fuck it, and if I did i would look 'em in the face
Tell hop out that bucket and spray
Tell 'em to make sure they hit my head and my waist
Tell them to circle round the block twice in case
Shit, cement pump in my veins, hard body to the death
Scream fuck the world with a capital F
Everybody extinct, it’s just me and my niggas left
And this is how we think

[Hook]
No tongue tissue niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war
Tell em'
No teddy bear niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war

[Verse 2]
And when I say hard body, homie, not in a physical
You either born with it or real niggas around real kids
And it’s passed on like a ritual, not sworn in it
You ain’t livin' it because you put it in sentences
And you ain’t givin' it if it’s ten percent, it gotta be a hundred
Walkin' down the block, K in my hands, fuck it, who want it?
I got a hundred shots for any one of you blood clots
Motherfucker, we will fuck ya
Spray your coupe and leave smoke in it like Chris Tucker
I’m no gimmick, we smell out the timid
We lift something out the trunk that got a kickstand with it
You either fall now or stand with it
You either crawl now or get laid down
Think about it, I’m only giving you one minute
Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, bloaw, you’re too late
Motherfucker, meet your fate

[Hook]
No tongue tissue niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war
Tell em'
No teddy bear niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war

[Verse 3]
Look between my eyes
You can see the fire burning like my Lamborghini tires
And my burner from the four fifth which is the four five
Which is that ninety-five Jordan shit
Jordans on your feet, we gon' take them shits
Put them on our feet and reshape them shits
Now don’t they look sweet?
Wear em for a minute, sell them the next week
That’s good profit, y'all ain’t thinkin' logic
You talkin' ass backwards like criss cross pockets
Mel Gibson, you just actin'
Lethal weapon, I take you niggas to target practice
Teach you niggas a lesson or two
Won’t you listen when a grown man is lecturin' you?
Cause any weapon will do in the process of fuckin' up you, nigga
You rappers ain’t built like us
Y'all just lift a lot of weights and look tough
We see through that, we shoot through anything that’s buff
And we ain’t thinkin' about handcuffs
The police runnin' from us, we so hard bodied, trust

[Hook]
No tongue tissue niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war
Tell em'
No teddy bear niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war

[Outro]
Tongue tissue ass niggas man, ay wait, we say, either go hard or go home, tha- tha- tha- that’s what we go by, either stand for something or fall for anything nigga, bite that, o- open your mouth, bite that go ahead, you’re suicidal
Yeah, , oh fuck, I’m winning anyway, I’m winning, I’m winning any mother fuckin' way, I can’t lose

Hold up, no, no, no, you—
Actually, you know what? I'm not gonna fucking drop the fucking beat
Fuck you guys

Okay, well then
Fuck a beat

[Verse 1: Ninja]
Yo, I don't fuck up or suck up to anyone
I wake up when I want, make our props, get paid out my asshole
My DJ's the mothafuckin' business
Every time he hits me with a beat I'm like Jesus!
I don't need anyone to help me
Dropped my record label I'm still very fuckin' wealthy
Money's not a problem, cash flow healthy
Vodacom was too expensive so I switched to Cell C
I don't ask famous people for their picture
When you see me on the streets just, be cool with the Ninja
Don't lose your fuckin' mind just say "Hi, how you feelin'?"
I'll say fine
Now stop freaking out and tweaking and start eating up my time
I don't hand people my fucking demo
Plus I never used to
Just make a track and drop that shit on YouTube
Quit steppin' to me dwankin' out
Try to fucking suck up
Just let your shit speak for itself and shut the fuck up!

[Yolandi]
Yooo.. fuck!
Drop the fucking beat Hi-Tek

[Verse 2]
Fuuuuck.. Jissis

Yo get off my back he's the gangsta, I'm just a fuckin' rat
I come from below, I run the show, rat's rule (Ya!)
You down to me, that's cool
You not down to me, what the fuck's down witchu?
Brah, you got issues
What?
My shit just so hot
And we won't stop 'til we fuckin' go pop
Life's a fuckin' soap opera
When you so popular
Don't fuck with little Miss Visser cause I'll fuck you up
I don't care
What you fuckin' think
Next time you try fuckin' with me maybe stop and think
"Why the hell am I so bothered by this chick?"
Am I maybe jealous or just fuckin' retarded

[Verse 3: Ninja]
Hahaha
Yo
I don't queue
I walk right through
You know who I fuckin' am man
Who the fuck are you?
When I'm in the club I get more chicks than I can manage
Grinding me front and back like a Ninja fuckin' sandwich
So don't stress
Everything I do is so sex
My style is so sex
My smile is so sex
My vibe is so fresh
My rhyme's are so next
Zef god with the spark might as well flex
Don't send mothafucka's "Please call me!"'s
Uh-uh
I send mothafucka's airtime
By my fuckin' stressed life
Me a little blessed life
Mama I don't lose
Betta' luck next time
Sucka's step back
You don't want to see Ninja snap
When I'm in South Africa I speak like I'm black
If you not a fan, why you keep coming back?
Exactly motherfucka you bumping this track
You stupid (I-I-I I don't dwank!)
You stupid (I-I-I I don't dwank!)
You stupid (I-I-I I don't dwank!)

[Verse 1]
Down the way where the nights are gay
And the sun shines daily on the mountain top
I took a trip on a sailing ship
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop

[Chorus]
But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston Town

[Verse 2]
Sounds of laughter everywhere
And the dancing girls sway to and fro
I must declare my heart is there
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico

[Chorus]
But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston Town

[Verse 3]
Down at the market you can hear
Ladies cry out while on their heads they bear
Ackee rice, salt fish are nice
And the rum is fine any time of year

[Chorus]
But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston Town

[Verse 4]
Down the way where the nights are gay
And the sun shines daily on the mountain top
I took a trip on a sailing ship
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop

[Chorus]
But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston Town
Sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston Town

When me look up in her eyes then she got me mesmerised
Picture perfect like a Kodak moment
When she kiss me goodnight and she feelin up on me

Safe to say that I'm hooked
on every single tattoo
Marveling in your looks
I just like to pass through
To see you. I just wanna see you
Even though we ain't together
It's your tattoos that I'm feeling
And I don't need to touch
I don't even need to look
Baby skip the wedding dress
We ain't going by the book
Everybody else tripping
They thinking that you be stripping
Just cause it's on your lower waist
They feel some type of way cause you different
Tattoo they notice that
PHD it's like it don't exist
Put all of that aside and just ride
stay tatted up cause I'm in love with it.

[Chorus:]
Girl you know it's my fetish
(I'm loving them)
Baby girl you don't get it

Love the way that they look

Girl they off the hook
(I'm down for them)
(Repeat)

[Verse 2]
Lotus on the side of your thigh
Took it like a champ said you wasn't gonna cry
Didn't shed a tear looking stronger than these guys
Not asking for the shake but I will take the fries
Cause you more than
An object to be used
Here to show you some love
Cause baby I know that you been abused
But girl you don't show
Told me watch where the tide go
Told me watch how the tide sweep
Loving you like a rough flow
But I'm down for it don't swim
Shawty got a yoga flame dhalsim
Artist she rap I rap we rap we clap
She sing I sing we sing
I drum while she play strings
I go she go we go you know
I see she see we see
This future bright between her and me
If I'm 22 then she 23
If I'm in the books she on CDs
If I'm trynna win she trynna win too
Outdoing me I'm out doing you
Love hate well just love will do
Just think this all started with a tattoo.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Tattoo on her back
On her arms on her wrists
Got my logo on her shoulder

She got more than enough
Know that I can't enough
Every time she get another

(Repeat)

[Chorus]

Back then I didn’t know you was a fake bitch
U couldn't try to apologize later, save it
U were hit n miss, motherfucker, face it
Yolandi is an anomaly
Told you you don’t wanna fuck with me
If you don’t like my shit unfollow me
I still believe in my dreams, yeah ya know I mean?

I’m caught up in this fucking rat trap
First they front then they back stab
U dwanky right hand bitch got no flavour
Looking at me like a fucking screensaver

[Ninja]
Uh

She bit off more than she could fucking manage
Boy, you stuck in the middle getting damaged
By a siff, soggy, whack bitch sandwich

[Chorus]
Me, I tell it like it is
Mama said “Baby, you should never tell a fib”
You used to think you the fucking shit
My friend, you got no idea who you fucking with
Me, I tell it like it is
Mama said “Baby, you should never tell a fib”
You used to think you the fucking shit
Motherfuckers got no idea who they fucking with

[Ninja]

Omnipresent motherfucking zef god
Everywhere you look I’m right there (Boo)

[Yolandi Visser]
I started this motherfucking zef shit
Yolandi Visser always on that next shit
I’m a fucking rat not a copycat
This happy cats take my style and molest it
Versace all up over my shit
Self-made motherfucker I'm rich

I’m caught up in this fucking rat trap
First they front then they back stab

Now look you make me change to be ugly
I’m caught up in this rat trap
First they front then they back stab
U keep trying to fuck me
Now look you make me change to be ugly

[Chorus]
Me, I tell it like it is

My friend, you got no idea who you fucking with
Me, I tell it like it is
Mama said “Baby, you should never tell a fib”
You used to think you the fucking shit
Motherfuckers got no idea who they fucking with

[Verse 1]
I'm stuck on the bench
And I'm crying
Watching all of my boys
Out there dying

Behind line two
But not for long

[Hook]
Young Blood
Baby let me back on the ice
Just for one more night
Young Blood

About your daughter

If I knew you were her father

Her ass is so fine
I'm breaking away
Past the blue line

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
"Ah, well, looks like we've got number 10, Youngblood, out on the ice tonight. This is the final game of the, uh, Junior Championship Hockey League. We've got the, uh, Thunder Bay Bombers, really lookin' tough out on the ice tonight. Let's see how, uh, referee, Hannah, calls the puck. Huh aw, looks like Youngblood's ready to get feisty out there, aw yeah, yaw to the shit."

And if I'm wrong, then the beach that I'm from ain't row
But it's strong, and you can see
Even if you ain't starin'
You weak, You can't rap, There ain't no comparin'
East Side's Greatest outlaws
No flaws, No slips, Pump your breaks, Hit the Disc

Ain't too much, just to hot to rush
Sit back, relax, and let me go ahead and buzz it up

So please, don't feel hesistant
Cause you know the dogg collar is president, in his resident
And the message is
No money, drink, no weed, all you need
Is this prestige, collar

Diamonds in the bank, like an impala
And I wouldn't trade mine for a million dollars

[Verse 1]
Uh, I’mma tell you that you not my competition
I’mma always win, throw me in and I’m going in
I ain’t running, I’mma come until you leave
I'm 'bout to get it, talk about it ‘cause I really live it
On them nights on a mission, no fear, no hope in my vision
Don’t need no intervention, you ain’t down to rider
And even if you was I come out, point ‘em out, they all gon’ be missing
Wonder why I’m still here act a fool if you met me (act a fool if you met me)
You try to be brave and step up with you crew it’s too scary
Plus I’m too legendary, It’s what we go hard for
I’m rocking your block, you on top you get knocked off
I’m taking your place yeah, I'll make it my property
May be a game to you, probably, that’s a way of life for me
And so it’s only right for me, annihilate ‘em if they in my way or sight
Keep 'em up off of me, a weakness in you only make an appetite
Anytime I get into it I be looking at them, looking pitiful
And their condition it be critical, nothing less than original
Cross me once that's the end of you - who’s next?

[Intro: Miley Cyrus]
If you came here to have a good time
If you came here to have a good time
One shot, two shot, three shot, four
This the one that brings the pretty girls to the floor
Swag drip drop, eatin' molly in here
Party turnt up long as molly in here, and

[Hook: Miley Cyrus]
All pretty girls just wanna have fun

[Verse 1: E-40]
I made a detour out the game when I was hustlin' crack
Made a couple of dollars, made a little bit of change, never looked back
You can find me at the shootin' range practicin' bustin' gats
Or in a vocal booth in the studio, bustin' raps
Put some gold on my body, got my body off Carlos Rossi
I'm sloppy, I treat my luxury scraper like a Bugatti
La di da di, she like to party off molly, Bacardi
Let her get naughty, a hotty up in the lobby, she stopped, she said
"Fortywater, where you 'bout to be?"
I said, "Follow me, follow me, follow me, bitch, room 223"
You got to pay me or pay me no attention, that's how I do
When you're born and raised in the V, Northern Cali, Silicon Valley

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]x2
Your baby momma love me
Your baby daddy hate me
Your bitch wanna fuck me
I said your bitch wanna fuck
So we gon' get it like

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
If you came here to have a good time
If you came here to have a good time, turn up
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the flyest of them all?
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the flyest of them all?
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the flyest of them all?
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the flyest of them all?

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Hey nigga, I'll make it happen, turnin' her ratchet
Thick chick under my arm make your chick look average
Thick bitch, yeah, a big ol' ass, poke it like a cactus
And she got a face that belongs up in a beauty pageant
It's ya boy, Juicy J, trippy, I got realer pimps
Balling hard everyday, ratchet bitches can't resist
I stay laughing to the bank but my dough ain't funny
I run out of rap before I run out of money
When I pop a pill, that's foreplay
Now I'm all in her face like Olay
I'm like "okay", I kill the pussy like OJ
When I'm finished with ya woman, she gon' think we soulmates

People think I’m interesting, 'cause I have fun and do my own thing
I don't smile, I snarl for the camera, golden tooth go shing

[Verse 4: Ninja]
Some people think I’m insane or they think I’m pain

[Bridge: Yo-landi & Ninja]
Love is strange, love is dark
Love sucks when you've got a broken heart
Love is weird, love ain’t smart
Love can fix a broken heart, make it glow in the dark
Techno heartbeat, techno heartbeat
Tech-tech-tech-tech-techno heartbeat
Techno heartbeat, techno heartbeat
Tech-tech-tech-tech-techno heartbeat

You know how I feel inside, too
Because I really, really, really, really like you
Roar! Hear me roar
My motherfuckin' selection is so incredible

Plus, I know you're for real and you'd kill for me
Baby, you're so rugged and raw
And you’re sweet, but I like it that you’re fokken hardcore
God bless you, baba, you a dream come true
That’s why i really, really, really, really love you

[Outro: Yo-Landi]
Cooking is so fun, cooking is so fun
Now it's time to take a break and see what we have done
Ah, it’s ready!
Wait a minute, what we’re doing isn’t cooking at all

[Verse 1]
We've been together for so very long
But now things are changing, oh, I wonder what's wrong
Seems you don't want me around
The passion is gone and the flame's died down
I guess I lost a little bit of self-esteem
That time that you made it with the whole hockey team
You used to think I was nice
Now you tell all your friends that I'm the Antichrist

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, why did you disconnect the brakes on my car?
That kind of thing is hard to ignore
Got a funny feeling you don't love me anymore

[Verse 2]
I knew that we were having problems when
You put those piranhas in my bathtub again
You're still the light of my life
Oh darling, I'm beggin', won't you put down that knife?
You know, I even think it's kinda cute the way
You poison my coffee just a little each day
I still remember the way that you laughed
When you pushed me down the elevator shaft

[Chorus]
Oh, if you don't mind me asking, what's this poisonous cobra
Doing in my underwear drawer?
Sometimes I get to thinking you don't love me anymore

[Verse 3]
You slammed my face down on the barbecue grill
Now my scars are all healing, but my heart never will
You set my house on fire
You pulled out my chest hairs with an old pair of pliers
Oh, you think I'm ugly and you say I'm cheap
You shaved off my eyebrows while I was asleep
You drilled a hole in my head
Then you dumped me in a drainage ditch and left me for dead

[Chorus]
Oh, you know this really isn't like you at all
You never acted this way before
Honey, something tells me you don't love me anymore
Oh no, no
Got a funny feeling you don't love me anymore...
As a young man, I didn't understand the power of certain words and how they can hurt. I thought it was ok to repeat hurtful words and jokes, but didn't realize at the time that it wasn't funny and that in fact my actions were continuing the ignorance

Thanks to friends and family I learned from my mistakes and grew up and apologized for those wrongs. Now that these mistakes from the past have become public I need to apologize again to all those I have offended

I'm very sorry. I take my friendships with people of all cultures very seriously and I apologize for offending or hurting anyone with my childish and inexcusable mistake. I was a kid then and I am a man now who knows my responsibility to the world and to not make that mistake again

Ignorance has no place in our society and I hope the sharing of my faults can prevent others from making the same mistake in the future. I thought long and hard about what I wanted to say but telling the truth is always what's right

Five years ago I made a reckless and immature mistake and I'm grateful to those close to me who helped me learn those lessons as a young man. Once again.... I'm sorry
This feels wrong
But let’s go
Our bones are sinking
Deep into the ocean

This feels wrong
But let’s go
We’re drowning in the
Flames of our devotion

I can’t feel it
‘Cause I’ve just thrown it
In the waves

I can’t feel it
Won’t you just save me?
OH!

[Verse 1]
Don’t make this hard for me
It’s not about who’s right or wrong, no
If it’s how it’s supposed to, really supposed to be
Then this love will carry on, girl
If we leave how we began
Then just know, that

[Chorus]
I only want what’s best for you
It’s not what’s good for me
It’s not about what I want
But it’s all about what you need
I want what’s best for you
But I don’t want you to leave
It’s not about what I want
But it’s all about what you need, I want what’s best for you

[Verse 2]
'Cause you're the sweetest thing I know
If I said I loved you, really loved you so
Then I could let you go
Girl, doesn't mean I'm giving up, no
So just know that

[Chorus]
I only want what’s best for you
It’s not what’s good for me
It’s not about what I want
But it’s all about what you need
I want what’s best for you
But I don’t want you to leave
It’s not about what I want
But it’s all about what you need, I want what’s best for you

[Bridge]
I want whats best for you, don't matter how bad it feels
Don't matter how much it hurts, you deserve your worth
I only want what's best, I don't wanna tell no lies
I don't wanna make you cry, I only want whats best

[Chorus]
I only want what’s best for you
It’s not what’s good for me
It’s not about what I want
But it’s all about what you need
I want what’s best for you
But I don’t want you to leave
It’s not about what I want
But it’s all about what you need, I want what’s best for you
I only want what’s best for you
It’s not what’s good for me
It’s not about what I want
But it’s all about what you need
I want what’s best for you
But I don’t want you to leave
It’s not about what I want
But it’s all about what you need, I want what’s best for you

[Outro]
What's best for you
Only want what's best for you
Only want what's best for you
Only want what's best for you
Only want what's best
Only want what's best
Only want what's best
Only want the best for you

[Verse 1]
I take a little powder
Take a little salt
Put it in my shotgun
I go walking

[Chorus]
Jubba jubba, wolly bully
Looking high, looking low
Going to scare you up and shoot ya
Mister Charlie told me so

[Verse 2]
I won't even take your life
Won't even take a limb
Just unload my shotgun
Take a little skin

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well you take my silver dollar
Take those silver dimes
Fix it up together
In some alligator wine
I can hear the drums, voodoo all night long
Mister Charlie tells me
I can't do nothing wrong

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Now Mister Charlie told me
Won't you like to know
Give you little warning
Before I let you go

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Going to scare you up and shoot ya
Mister Charlie
Mister Charlie told me so
Well, the first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
'Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door

Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Woah, oh, what I want to know
Is are you kind?

It's a buck dancer's choice my friend
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice

Will you come with me?
Won't you come with me?
Woah, oh, what I want to know
Will you come with me?

Goddamn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like
Their walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home

It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go

Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Woah, oh, what I want to know
Where does the time go?

I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune

Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-ho what I want to know
How does the song go?

Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

Whoa-ho what I want to know
How does the song go?

Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide

Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh (To fade)

Songwriters:  Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter

[Intro]
We're gonna
We're gonna make this a night
Listen

[Verse 1]
When you love someone, it's natural not demanding
That's one thing I'm proud to say I found in you
I'm so glad we reached that understanding
Now I know my heart is safe with you
So now my love to you, baby, I surrender

[Chorus]
Get ready, tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready, oh baby, tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember

[Verse 2]
Celebrations and my heart could stay united
And there's nothing in this world to come between me and you
We're together and it keeps me so excited
To think of what the power of love can do, ooh
And I'm filled with a love that's oh so tender

[Chorus]
Get ready (Get ready), tonight (Oh)
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready, oh baby, tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
(We're gonna make this a night to remember)
Get ready, tonight (Remember, baby)
Gonna make this a night to remember (Hey, hey, hey)
Get ready, oh baby, tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember

[Bridge]
We're gonna make this a night
We're gonna make this a night
You won't forget, I won't forget

[Chorus]
Get ready (Baby), tonight (Darling)
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready (Darling), tonight (Baby)
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready, tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember

Tonight...make this a night to remember
Tonight...make this a night to remember

[Verse 3]
Let's make a toast to those who helped make this occasion
They turn their backs on love
But that's what drove you straight to me
Now to you I'll make a lasting dedication
I'll show you all the love that life can be, ooh
And each day that I live I will deliver

[Chorus]
Get ready (This night you won't forget), tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready ('Cause your love I won't regret), tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready (We're gonna make this a night), tonight
(We're gonna make this a night)
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready (Oh, baby, tonight), tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember

[Outro]
We're gonna make this a night
We're gonna make this a night
We gotta make this a night
Make this tonight...

[Intro: Yolandi]
Ah, love... Lovely love, love, love, love, love, love
Makes you feel so trippy!
Like you're stoned and drunk at the same time
Strunk! 24/7 baba

[Verse 1: Ninja]
You make me feel like every day is Saturday, my friend
Go to sleep, wake up it’s Saturday again
I'm a busy man, I'm goin 'round the world
Got me fucked up by this pretty little girl
You know all I really wanna do
Is get on a plane and come and visit you
Fly close to the sun, Jesus, what's going on?

[Chorus]
Oh, my God, I'm so strunk
Stoned, drunk... Oh, fuck
Help me, Lord, I'm so strunk
Fucked up, love drunk

[VERSE 2: Yolandi]
I’m zoning out in my room all alone
Staring at the fucking telephone
Is this for real or are you just playing games?
Haven't heard from you in three whole days
You told me, you want me to be your girl
Look into my eyes and promise me the world
Tell me, is this really true romance?
Or are you just trying to get in my pants?
Party tonight everybody's goin' on tellin' me we gotta go
Just close the door, switch off the light, leave me alone
I don't wanna fucking go
Fuck your pinky promise playboy
First you steal my heart and then you go
And just leave me so desperately lonely

[Chorus]
Oh, my God, I'm so strunk
Stoned, drunk... Oh, fuck
Help me, Lord, I'm so strunk
Fucked up, love drunk
Oh, my God, I'm so strunk
Stoned, drunk... Oh, fuck
Help me, Lord, I'm so strunk
Fucked up, love drunk

[Bridge: Ninja & Yolandi]
Love lifts you up like an eagle, baby girl
You're so cool, you're so next
You're so natural, you're so sex
Love fucks you up like an evil angel
You so cool, cool as ice
But playboy you tell fucking lies

[Chorus]
Oh, my God, I'm so strunk
Stoned, drunk... Oh, fuck
Help me, Lord, I'm so strunk
Fucked up, love drunk
Oh, my God, I'm so strunk
Stoned, drunk... Oh, fuck
Help me, Lord, I'm so strunk
Fucked up, love drunk

[Intro: Yolandi/Ninja]

Ho-ho-hold up! When I'm on the mic it's like 'oh fuck!'
Mad pussy on tap when you blow up
'Who's you're favourite rapper ninja?'

All around the world they say they miss me, aw
Nice to see you again, how you been sweetheart?
'Whatcha gonna do today ninjie huh?'
Whatever I feel like I wanna do, fuck
'Cause not doing whatever the fuck you wanna do sucks
Girls wiggling, giggling, telling me I'm the man
But every time I take off my fucking underpants

[Chorus: Ninja]
Some girls start crying, some girlies run away
I'm like huh what the fuck? Man okay
Just relax yourself baby it's gonna be okay
It's not my fault I was born this way

Brave girls always got a lot of love
For my raging ZEF boner

[Verse 2: Ninja]
Wow! I'm a big fucking rap star now

They say time is money so I'm sellin' swag
Time is money (x8)

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Time is money

Bad bitch with me while I'm on the script

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Walkin' around with the cheddar
Young nigga trendsetter

Pull up in Bentley with Soulja
Young nigga I’m selling that coca no cola

Rel-money he pulls up extra-money

That AP cost 50 my diamonds go dummy
He wanted a brick so I jugg him finesse I'm wrappin' a mummy

Momma said she want a Rove'
Gotta know I'mma get it trappin' off a Motorola
Ion' trust no bitch Ion' love no bitch
Put her in the kitchen with the baking soda
Walkin' on Louboutins
Young nigga I pull up in coupe again
The money is coming in
Young nigga I roll with the hooligans

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I've seen the blood, I've seen the broken
The lost and the sights unseen
I want a flood, I want an ocean
To wash my confusion clean
I can't resolve this empty story
I can't repair the damage done

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
We acted out, we wear the colors
Confined by the things we own
We're not without, we're like each other
Pretending we're here alone
And far away they burn their buildings
Right in the face of the damage done

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion
Rebellion
Rebellion
Rebellion

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Rebellion, rebellion
We lost before the start
Rebellion, rebellion
One by one, we fall apart
We fall apart
We fall apart
We fall apart

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of, imitations of...
We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion
Rebellion
Rebellion
Rebellion

[Verse 1]
The beautiful days are long gone
I can’t seem to breathe
It feels like it hasn't been that long
Since you walked away from me
Now I can try to act real strong
But you and I both know I still think of you that way
You should know… that
The beautiful lights, the star filled nights
They don’t mean a thing
'Cause you were my star and so it don’t seem right
Without you here with me
Now I can try to act real strong
But you and I both know it's hard for me to say
You were my soul

[Chorus]
Now I could say that I don’t love you no more
And I could say that I’ve closed the door... for our love
And I can tell you I feel It’s time for us to go our separate ways
But baby, I just wouldn’t be the same
'Cause girl, your love is still on my brain

[Verse 2]
Now when you're in love, it takes time to heal
When someone's broken your heart, it changes how you feel
Girl, I thought that you’d never do me that way
But even after all, I still think of you that way

[Chorus]
Now I could say that I don’t love you no more
(I could say this and I could say that)
And I could say that I’ve closed the door... for our love
And I can tell you I feel It’s time for us to go our separate ways
But baby, I just wouldn’t be the same
'Cause girl, your love is still on my brain

[Bridge]
Now love is a game that we both like to play
But will I win or lose if I go or if I stay? Yeah
Even though I try to hide my broken heart inside
Girl, you know me inside out and I can’t get you off my mind

[Chorus]
Now I could say that I don’t love you no more
And I could say that I’ve closed the door for our love
And I can tell you I feel it’s time for us to go our separate ways
But baby, I just wouldn’t be the same
'Cause girl your love is still on my brain, yeah

[Verse 1]
Just a little rush, babe, to feel dizzy
To derail the mind of me
Just a little hush, babe; my veins are busy
But my heart's in atrophy

[Pre-Chorus]
Any way
To distract and sedate
Adding shadows
To the walls of the cave

[Chorus 1]
You and I, nursing on a
Poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined
With the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we
Can feel none of it

[Verse 2]
Something isn't right, babe; I keep catching
Little words, but the meaning's thin
I'm somewhere outside my life, babe; I keep scratching
But somehow I can't get in

[Pre-Chorus]
So we're slaves
To any semblance of touch
Lord, we should quit
But we love it too much

[Chorus 2]
Sedated, we're nursing on a
Poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined
With the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we
Can feel none of it

[Bridge]
Darlin', don't you
Stand there watching, won't you
Come and save me from it?
Darlin', don't you
Join in, you're supposed to
Drag me away from it

[Pre-Chorus]
Any way
To distract and sedate
Adding shadows
To the walls of the cave

[Chorus 1]
You and I, nursing on a
Poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined
With the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we
Can feel none of it

[Chorus 2]
Sedated, we're nursing on a
Poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined
With the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we
Can feel none of it

[Verse 1]
You say that you wanna go
To a land that's far away
How are we supposed to get there
With the way that we're living today?
You talk lots about God
Freedom comes from the call
But that's not what this bitch wants
Not what I want at all

[Chorus]
I want money, power and glory
I want money and all your power, all your glory
Hallelujah, I wanna take you for all that you got
Hallelujah, I'm gonna take them for all that they got

[Post-Chorus]
Baby…

[Verse 2]
The sun also rises on those who fail the call
My life, it comprises of losses and wins and fails and falls
But I can do it if you really, really like that
I know what you really want, b-baby
I can do it if you think you'll like that
You should run, boy, run

[Chorus]
I want money, power and glory
I want money and all your power, all your glory
Hallelujah, I wanna take you for all that you got
Hallelujah, I'm gonna take them for all that they got

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, baby…

[Bridge]
Dope and diamonds
Dope and diamonds
Diamonds
Dope and diamonds
Dope and diamonds
That's all that I am
Dope and diamonds
Dope and diamonds
Diamonds
Dope and diamonds
Dope and diamonds
Diamonds

[Chorus]
I want money, power and glory
I want money and all your power, all your glory
Hallelujah, I wanna take you for all that you got
Hallelujah, I'm gonna take them for all that they got

[Post-Chorus]
Baby…

[Verse 1 (R. Kelly)]
I feel that the time is here
For you to bring your body here
And give me what I've waited for
Hurry up and come on in and close the door
I'm about to get up on it
Feed me girl cause I'm so hungry
Got plenty money but I'm still lonely
Gotta have you now cause me so---
Black and Asia girl
Tattoo on your tummy
Thugged out and scared
But I'm uh make you love me
Say some aphrodisiacs
Baby girl its on
I promise you I will do all these words to the song

[Chorus]
Showdown

(Rodeo be like) up and down
(Bout to show you how I) roll down

Showdown

Baby its about to be uh...

[intermission]

[Verse 2 (R. Kelly)]
I'll be making you my lady
S.E.- got me going crazy
Any-thing that you want me to do
I'll do anything cause I'm feeling you
All through the club girl you dance so freaky
Tall diamond pierced with a look that kinky
Ac-ting like you want me to turn you---
Attitude like what, Kelly turn me now
Black and Asia girl
Tattoo on your tongue
Thugged out and scared
But I'm uh make you love me
Say some aphrodisiacs
Baby girl its on
I promise you I will do all these words to the song

[Chorus x1]

[intermission]

[Verse 3 (R. Kelly)]
Now gimme the mic so i can get buck wild
Like fiesta, fiesta still moving the crowd
Out of all the girls I've loved before
Got plenty of honeys--
Puff puff give now let me hit it once more
Fake ass niggas get out and close my door
Its my house for me to live not yours
If I wanted to I could- on the floors
Through the doors like a western flick the club is crunk
Penny and Chris you know that boys tow up
About 8 or 9 black stallion riding up
Its Mr. Big screaming showdown I'm like what...

[Mr. Big]
Now Kelly-
Its not enough room in this town
For you and me so lets get down
I'm sick and tired of you and this down low fight
From contagious all the way to Mrs. Price
You done it now with Ms. Black Asia
I knew something was funny when she stopped paging
House, cars, shopping mall
Man I tell you its a battle call
Like a raging bull
I'm about to charge
Kelly, you won't see tomorrow
Its time to put a end to your late night creeps
Now any last words before my pistol speaks...

[(R. Kelly) -spits-]
Mr. Biggs-
Now no disrespect but man I'm tired
Cause all these years its my back you've been riding
We've been in and out of fights on these videos
Now its about time you felt the real rodeo
See I dated lila '98 of September
You took her from me yea right you don't remember
I remember so clearly we were coming from an opera
How clever you were when you slipped her your number
(ooh) I know that makes ya'll wanna know
(ooh) Who's really on the down low
You wonder why we're always at it there it is
Sleeves up Mr. Biggs
Cause I'm about to get- wild, wild, west
Sick and tired of your mess
You put me to the test
And now I'm sticking out my chest
So any last words before I draw these cannons
Cause when the smoke clears I'll be the last man standing

[Chorus x2]

[Intro]
Hello world, how you do
All my life, I played the fool
See I don't understand you
Please won't you help me to

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm cursed and I'm damned, I can't find my way out the dark
I'm cursed and I'm damned, I can't find my way out the dark
I need you to be, world
What I imagine you to be, world
See it's so funny to me (oh-oh, ha-ha)
It's so funny to me

[Verse 1]
The Lord works in mysterious ways but me gettin' what I dreamed ain't mysterious mane
How I ended up, after being stuck in a rut
Drinkin' warm beer outta red cups
Thinkin' 'bout the model girls, throw some D-cups
Wanna bone me 'cause I make some G-cuts
But what about the good days with them genuine girls with curls
Playin' double dutch on Kingsmen with Ben and them
Man this craze, remember the days, when it wasn't 'bout bills
Or finer tip drills or china chrome wheels, plus chrome on the grill
The smile of the moon is savin' me from my doom
And starin' four walls down in a small room
My Momma tell me that my dreams will come true
As I sit back and I smoke my weed
I collapse off my feet, it's funny to me

[Bridge]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, woah
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

[Verse 2]
Walkin' down on Broadway in broad day
I some how feel there's somethin' wrong with me
My homie said "I don't know what's wrong with you man, don't you know this, this life was made for you" word? I'm cursed

[Chorus]
I'm cursed and I'm damned, I can't find my way out the dark
I'm cursed and I'm damned, I can't find my way out the dark
I need you to be, world
What I imagine you to be, world
See it's so funny to me, it's so funny to me
Woah

[Verse 1]
Your baby's falling
You know I'm talking now
You know I'm dancing
You know I'm racing round

No no you're so juiced
You said you'd kick the booze
You know I'll get bruised
You know I'm just a boy

[Chorus]
Come back baby, don't you cry
Don't you drain those big blue eyes
I've been crawling
Come back baby, don't you cry
Just you say the reason why
I can calm you

[Verse 2]
You say I'm bawling
I say I'm begging while
You take my photo
I fake my breaking smile
I'm fucking loco
I can't get through to you
You turn your nose you
Spark up and I can go

[Chorus]
Come back baby, don't you cry
Don't you drain those big blue eyes
I've been crawling
Come back baby, don't you cry
Just you say the reason why
I can calm you

Hey what's hattin' its Big Gucci, I make music, I make money, I make enemies. But my fans make me the Trap God. Big Guwop. 

[?]
June 17th, 1017, the empire’s declaring war, I’m dropping the World War 3D. Three albums in one day. The Green Album by the Migos, The Purple Album by Young Thug, and The White Album with Peewee Longway. I would like to thank Mike Will Made It, 808 Mafia, Sonny Digital, Metro Boomin, C4, DJ Plugg, and The Honorable C Note for their help in producing the 2014 soundtrack for the summer…July 4 I’m dropping Trap House 4 and Sept 13 I’m dropping Trap God 3. Even though I’m locked up, I still run the streets from jail. It’s Guwop Coreleone

[Verse 1]
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
If you can use some exotic booze, there's a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

[Verse 2]
Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
In llama land, there's a one man band, and he'll toot his flute for you
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue

[Chorus]
Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near
You may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together

[Verse 3]
Weather wise, it's such a lovely day
Just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near
You may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together

[Verse 3]
Weather wise, it's such a lovely day
You just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly

[Outro]
Pack up, let's fly away

[Verse 1: Mac DeMarco]
Maybe when we're older
We can try this over
Lovin' on the sidelines
Another one of my kind

[Chorus]
Robson Girl
Sit down by your daddy
Robson Girl
Sit down by your daddy

[Verse 2]
No one else's shoulder
I felt, could be colder
Lovin' on the sidelines
Just one street on my mind
(AH!)

[Chorus]
Robson Girl
Sit down by your daddy
Robson Girl
Sit down by your daddy
Robson Girl
Sit down by your daddy
Robson Girl
Sit down by your daddy

[Outro]
That's a wrap

[Verse 1]

The real deal Holyfield CTE killer
And I can't lie I done robbed a lot of Cali niggas
I know some real OG's in L.A nigga
Last time I checked I was the shit in the Bay nigga
A Sacramento nigga used to send the dope to me
Humble County kush my plug sent the smoke to me
CEO Gucci, Eazy-E my idol nigga
I heard your brother is a gangster, you not your brother nigga

[Verse 2]
The realest nigga in the rap game, hands down
You showing your ass nigga yeah you got your pants down

I'll take your life and you'll never meet your grandchild
If you ever had a plug nigga stand up
If a nigga tried to rob you nigga man up
You ever ran off just to run your bands up
You ever went broke damn fuck the lights cut
These niggas would suck a nigga dick to make a hit record
I'll never dick ride that's why I'm a legend
I never snitched now time not even 60 seconds
Got so much street cred that these niggas disrespected

[Verse 1]
Hey, man
Heard you were your brother's keeper
That can't be
Judgin' by the way you treat her

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, you've done it again
No use when you already know how it ends

[Chorus]
Treat her better, boy
If havin' her at your side's something you enjoy
If havin' her in your life's really so important to you now

[Verse 2]
Hey, man
Who's been keepin' brother?
Hey, man, how old is your mother?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, you've done it again
No use when you already know how it ends

[Chorus]
Treat her better, boy
If havin' her at your side's something you enjoy
If havin' her in your life's really so important to you now
Treat her better, boy
If havin' her at your side's something you enjoy
If havin' her in your life's really so important to you now

[Chorus]
Treat her better, boy
If havin' her at your side's something you enjoy
If havin' her in your life's really so important to you now
Treat her better, boy
If havin' her at your side's something you enjoy
If havin' her in your life's really so important to you now

[Verse 1]
Pack it up and leave it
Leave it all behind you
Startin' fresh in someone else's town
And though we may be leavin'
I'll be right beside you
To pick you up, until you come around

[Chorus]
So please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy
Please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy

[Verse 2]
Honey it can be tough
Without your friends beside you
You built up, just to knock it down
So when you're feelin' rough
I'll be right behind you, to pick you up
Until you come around

[Chorus]
So please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy
Please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy

Please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy
Please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy
So please, go easy with my baby

So please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy
Please, go easy with my baby

And put that ass to work
We got Ciroc
And patron on lock
If you wan' another shot
Then put that ass to work
Sexy girl I can tell your a rebel
Low cut skirt and five inch stilettos
Pink top
Piercing with heavy metal
And you're looking at me
Like whipped cream on jello
If you, if you, if you wanna go with me
Then you gotta be a pro indeed

Let me see you shake it 'till you make it
In my phone book, then maybe I get you naked (Ow)

Let me see you shake it 'till you make it
In my phone book, then maybe I get you naked (Ow)

[Chorus x2]
You call me up at six, come 'round
Undressing in my house again
Your t-shirt’s on the floor
Yeah we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Used to come around
You'd be knockin' on my front door
Playing board-games
Horror films with the super gore
Thought that you were cute from the start
Yeah I’m pretty sure
You were like the medicine
The medicine I wanted more
All along I wanted someone to vibe with
Found the guy I want the rest of my life with
We on some husband and wife shit
I don’t really care, ‘cause I know that I like it

[Pre-Chorus]
And when the clouds part open
When the last word is spoken
When the last heart’s been broken
We’ll be sitting on your bedroom floor still smoking
And when the clouds part open
When the last word is spoken
When the last heart’s been broken
We’ll be sitting on your bedroom floor
Still smoking
Smoking, smoking

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Don't stop just get it
Let me see what you workin' with
Baby girl is you wit'it?
Don't stop, keep twerkin' it

Let me tell you what I like
Look at you, you just my type
Lookin' in your eyes
It blows my mind
Let me look back at it one more time
She pop, she pop, she know just what she doin'
Real cute in the face
But real slim in the waist
So you know that I'm pursuing

So tell me what we doin'
Baby girl, where we go from here?
Wanna tell you what I like
Let me whisper in your ear
So go and break it down
I'm ask you once
So you know I got to make it count

Now don't just listen
Baby girl, don't make a sound
When I get you back home all alone
Gonna make it bounce
Okay I'm getting off track, so what

I'd like to spend some time with you
Maybe share a glass of wine or two
Talk all night, share a joke or two
Maybe get a smile or laugh at you

But first, but first
You ain't gotta keep searchin'
Just hit me up where you workin'
I'll tell you what I like in person

[Verse 3: Charli XCX]
Oh now I got a plan, I hope you gonna be my man
I can see us cushy in the house right by the ocean sand
And when I’m one to cry
I hope you gonna hold my hand
And when they gonna shake us down
I hope you're gonna make a stand
This shit is super wild, this shit is super cool
This shit is kinda gangsta, I think I’m into you
This shit is super wild, this shit is super cool
This shit is kinda gangsta, I think I’m into you

[Chorus  x2]

[Pre-Song]
I was in the winter of my life
And the men I met along the road were my only summer
At night I fell asleep with visions of myself dancing and laughing and crying with them
Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me
And my only real happy times

I was a singer
Not a very popular one
I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet
But upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky
That I wished on over and over again, sparkling and broken
But I didn’t really mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is

When the people I used to know found out what I had been doing how I had been living, they asked me why, but there’s no use in talking to people who have a home
They have no idea what its like to seek safety in other people
For home to be wherever you lie your head

I was always an unusual girl
My mother told me that I had a chameleon soul
No moral compass pointing due north
No fixed personality
Just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean
And if I said I didn’t plan for it to turn out this way I’d be lying
Because I was born to be the other woman
Who belonged to no one
Who belonged to everyone
Who had nothing
Who wanted everything
With a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldn’t even talk about it
And pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me

[Song]

[Post-Song]
Every night I used to pray that I’d find my people
And finally I did
On the open road
We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore
Except to make our lives into a work of art

Live fast
Die young
Be wild
And have fun

I believe in the country America used to be
I believe in the person I want to become
I believe in the freedom of the open road
And my motto is the same as ever
"I believe in the kindness of strangers"
And when I'm at war with myself
I ride
I just ride

Who are you?
Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies?
Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?

I have
I am fucking crazy
But I am free

[Verse 1]
We came a long, long way
Through the wind and rain
I nearly sank my heart in the empty glass
Spent my time alone, but you're at the phone
And when I fall apart, I'll swim with the sharks

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll always be right there
And I will always love you
You changed my vision when you said to me...
(Uh...)

[Chorus]
You, you are my shining star
Don't lose your glow
Don't fade away into the darkness
You, you are my shining star
Don't lose your glow
Don't fade away into the darkness

[Verse 2]
In the box of doom, in a hotel room
You're across the sea, but you're near to me
You know you gave me hope, and now I stay afloat
I used to sleep to scream
And now I sleep to dream of you

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll always be right there
And I will always love you
You changed my vision when you said to me...
(Uh...)

[Chorus]
You, you are my shining star
Don't lose your glow
Don't fade away into the darkness
You, you are my shining star
Don't lose your glow
Don't fade away into the darkness
You, you are my shining star
Don't lose your glow
Don't fade away into the darkness
You, you are my shining star
Don't lose your glow
Don't fade away into the darkness

[Intro]
One Umbrella millionaire
Seen money, such a young nigga

[Chorus]
We was just some little niggas
On and off the corner, just wanna be a baller
I was just a little nigga, just a little nigga
And I hit my lil lick, same day I got rich

You'd think that my women are only Jamaican
I know that she think she my only
But that bitch is only mistaken
You trickin', she know that you weak
And that's why that bitch don't be behavin'
Nigga, I'm amazin', send a subpoena
The name is Argentina and Jesus could save me
I see that you hatin', ignorin' a nigga

I give my people the pay
But niggas is evil
They really gon' get all their people in place, Swavey
So call off the ventin' and call up the Lord
And call up the waiter and tell all them bottles come to me with a sparkles
I got to bills when them bitches come out and they parkin' the car though
Now tell all them bitches to tell all them bitches they talkin' to  Fargo

[Chorus]
We was just some little niggas
On and off the corner, just wanna be a baller
I was just a little nigga, just a little nigga
And I hit my lil lick, same day I got rich
Then I drop 600, tell them bitches I'm big homie
Told them niggas they done turn me to the old me
Godfather, putting .40 in the '03
Fallin' down to my knees

Let a young nigga win
Please Lord, let me win win win
Let a young nigga win

[Verse 2]
And the top get dropped and the spot get locked
I'm a dog, get guap and my broad give top
Nigga go so hard we should all get knocked
Nigga hatin' on us, they can all get shot
Young nigga, did it all for the Balmain
Whip foreign and the car leather
J$EAN in the " Wait"
Brrrr, I'm ignorin' when the call ring
High rise, big views in the high rise
We be livin' no more leasin', nigga
Uh, now it's 7k on that feature, nigga
And for any nigga with your side murkin'
Gonna pull up on 'em like I'm side skirtin'

Grind certain, while my side hurtin'
Nigga broke, why? 'Cause they did not work it
Bad broad, and she be fire twerkin'
Like a north tape but it's the live version

[Bridge]
Like Ho, ho, ho
Fuck it, I'm killin' these niggas
Ho, ho, ho

Ho, ho, ho

[Chorus]
We was just some little niggas
On and off the corner, just wanna be a baller
I was just a little nigga, just a little nigga
And I hit my lil lick, same day I got rich
Then I drop 600, tell them bitches I'm big homie
Told them niggas they done turn me to the old me
Godfather, putting .40 in the '03
Fallin' down to my knees

[Outro]
Please Lord, let me win
Please Lord, let me win

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Tearing me apart with the words you wouldn't say
And suddenly tomorrow's a moment washed away
'Cause I don't have a reason and you don't have the time
But we both keep on waiting for something we won't find

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
The final masquerade

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
All I ever wanted, the secrets that you keep
All you ever wanted, the truth I couldn't speak
'Cause I can't see forgiveness and you can't see the crime
But we both keep on waiting, for what we left behind

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
The final masquerade
The final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade
We said it was forever, but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
The final masquerade

[Pre-verse]
To my freakers
To my freakers

[Verse 1: Skyblu]
(Shit!) Got the flow whip, we the new thang

Until we getting dizzy
We don't stop
Until they turn on the lights or call the cops

[Bridge]
Ayo, I'm a gigalo
Dancing on the floor with a packet of dough
If you're C-walking
If you're two-stepping
If your cranking that
Then it don't matter pimpin'

[Verse 2: Skyblu]
Even on Myspace they call my shit the bomb
If I keep it up I'll have more friends than Tom
Skyblu baby, I'm something new baby
How you describe your style?
Call it the new 80s
Gold chains, Just frames
The women all up on us 'cause we entertain
Stay fly, no lie
My momma named me sky
So high
I ain't your pusher man
But I got what you need
A double dose of Foo
A double dose of me
So if you C-walking
And you two stepping
And if you cranking that
Then it don't matter pimpin

[Hook]

[Outro]
Bounce, bounce, make it hot
Let me see that booty pop x10

[Verse 1]
Life is awesome, I confess
What I do, I do best
You got nothing, I got tested
And I passed, yes

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay me down tonight in my linen and curls
Lay me down tonight, Riviera girls

[Chorus]
I fucked my way up to the top
This is my show
I fucked my way up to the top
Go, baby, go
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show

[Verse 2]
I'm a dragon, you're a whore
Don't even know what you're good for
Mimicking me's a fucking bore
To me, but, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay me down tonight in my diamonds and pearls
Tell me songs at night 'bout your favorite girl

[Verse 1]
Heavy metal love of mine
I should have learned to let you stay
You didn't want me all the time
But you were worth it anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were so much better
Than the rest of them
Out of all the others
You were the honest man

[Chorus]
He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns
And roses, roses, roses

[Verse 2]
Motorcycle love divine
I should have learned to let you play
I wasn't the marrying kind
I should have done it anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
We should have left Las Vegas
And then began again
Took your bike to Detroit
Back to the promised land

[Chorus]
He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns
And roses, roses, roses

[Bridge]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
See you walking on that blue Pacific
I can see you bathing in the summer light
Turning tan and you look terrific
You got game, boy, game, boy
You got game, boy, game, boy
You got game, boy, game, boy
You got game

[Chorus]
He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses

[Outro]
Roses, roses, roses

[Verse 1]
White lines, pretty baby, tattoos
Don't know what they mean
They're special, just for you
White lines, baking powder on the stove
Cooking up a dream, turning diamonds into snow

[Verse 2]
I feel you, pretty baby, feel me
Turn it up hot, loving you is free
I like it down, like it down way low
But you already know that
You already know
(Fuck!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime
Chic-a-Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side

[Chorus]
Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the dope fiends
Yayo, yayo, yayo
(Fuck!)

[Verse 3]
Gun in my mouth and gold hoops
You like your little baby like you like your drinks--cool
White lines, pretty daddy, go skiing
You snort it like a champ, let the winter we're not in
(Fuck!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime
Chic-a-Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side

[Chorus]
Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the dope fiends
Yayo, yayo, yayo

[Bridge]
We could get high in Miami
Ooh, ooh
Dance the night away
People never die in Miami
Ooh, ooh
That's what they all say (Yay)

[Interlude]
(You believe me, don't you baby?)

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on down to Florida

[Intro]
Ah, ah

[Verse 1]
Being a mistress on the side (Ah, yeah-ah)
It might not appeal to fools like you (Ah)
Creeping around on the side
Might not be something you would do
(Ah, ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
But you haven't seen my man (Man)
You haven't seen my man (Man, man)
You haven't seen my man (Man)
You haven't seen him (Whoa-ah)

[Chorus]
He's got the fire and he walks with it
He's got the fire and he talks with it
His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl

[Post-Chorus]
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a bad girl

[Verse 2]
Being a bad bitch on the side (Ah, ah)
Might not appeal to fools like you (Ah, ah)
Creeping around while he gets high
It might not be something you would do (ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
But you haven't seen my man (Man)
You haven't seen my man (Man, man)
You haven't seen my man (Man)
You haven't seen him (Whoa-ah)

His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl

Watch what you say to me
Careful who you're talking to
Watch what you say to me
Careful who you're talking to
I'm on fire, baby

[Chorus]
He's got the fire and he walks with it
He's got the fire and he talks with it
His Bonnie on the side, Bonnie on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl
His money on the side, money on the side
Makes me a sad, sad girl

[Post-Chorus]
I'm a sad girl

I'm a sad girl
I'm a sad girl
I'm a bad girl
I'm a bad girl

[Verse 1]
All the pretty stars shine for you, my love
Am I that girl that you dream of?
All those little times you said that I'm your girl
You make me feel like your whole world

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll wait for you, babe
That's all I do, babe
Don't come through, babe
You never do

[Chorus]
Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry

[Verse 2]
All those special times I spent with you, my love
They don't mean shit compared to all your drugs
But I don't really mind, I've got much more than that
Like my memories, I don't need that

[Pre-Chorus]
I wait for you, babe
You don't come through, babe
You never do, babe
That's just what you do

[Chorus]
Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry

[Bridge]
Don't say you need me when
You leave and you leave again
I'm stronger than all my men
Except for you
Don't say you need me if
You know that you're leaving
I can't do it, I can't do it
But you do it well

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry

[Intro]
Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne, and white sunshine
Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine
The kids were young and pretty

[Verse 1]
Where have you been? Where did you go?
Those summer nights seem long ago
And so is the girl you used to call
The Queen of New York City

[Chorus]
But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 2]
The power of youth is on my mind
Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time
Will you still love me when I shine
From words but not from beauty?

[Verse 3]
My father's love was always strong
My mother's glamour lives on and on
Yet still inside, I felt alone
For reasons unknown to me

[Chorus]
But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Bridge]
And if you call, I'll run, run, run
If you change your mind, I'll come, come, come

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Outro]
Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne, and hot sunshine
Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine
And we were young and pretty

[Verse 1]
The other woman has time to manicure her nails
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair anywhere

[Verse 2]
The other woman enchants her clothes with French perfume
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
And there are never toys that's scattered everywhere

[Bridge]
And when her old man comes to call
He finds her waiting like a lonesome queen
'Cause to be by her side
It's such a change from old routine
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
The other woman will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by, the other woman will spend her life alone
Alone

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby, do, do
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, oh
Oh, oh
Alone

[Verse 1]
High up in the Hollywood hills, taking violet pills
Writing all of my songs about my cheap thrills
You're a hard man to love and I'm
A hard woman to keep track of
You like to rage, don't do that
You want your way, you make me so mad
Got your gun, I've got my dad

[Refrain]
Hmmm
Hmmm
Hmmm

[Chorus]
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?

[Verse 2]
High up in the Hollywood hills, crushing violet pills
You've been trying to write a novel about your cheap thrills
You think you're Hunter S. Thompson
I think you're fucking crazy as the day's long
Man to man, heart to heart
I love you but you drive me so far
Wish you well on that star

[Refrain]
Hmmm
Hmmm
Hmmm

[Chorus]
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?

[Bridge]
Witch Hazel, Witch Hazel
Betrayal, betrayal
One gun on the table
Headshot if you're able

[Chorus]
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?

[Outro]
Hmmmm
Hmmmm
Hmmmm
Hmmmm

[Verse 1]
Are you gonna hurt me now?
Or are you gonna hurt me later?
Are you gonna go to town?
Maybe you should play it safer

[Verse 2]
You've got me all dressed up tonight
Springsteen on the radio
You've got me all freaked out tonight
Somethin' you're telling me, what? - I don't know

[Chorus]
You don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry, but
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again

[Interlude]
Drinks on the patio

[Verse 3]
Are you gonna tell me now?
Are you gonna tell me later?
'Cause if you think that I don't know
I'm gonna have to say you're crazy

[Verse 4]
I'm getting all dressed up tonight
Dressed up just to hear you, boy
I already know what you got in store
Why I go? - Baby, I don't know

[Chorus]
'Cause you don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry, but
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside I could catch me again

[Bridge]
So you think you're in charge?
Do you?
Acting like a big shot
I'm sure
So you think you're in charge?
Do you?
You're acting like a big shot

[Chorus]
You don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry but
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again

Now rub me wrong and fuck up my massage
And it’s flowers for the dead, better get em a corsage

And everything I do, I San Diego Charge
While you niggas just starve
I’m eating so much I'mma fuck around and barf
And, red is the color of my scarf (B's up)
And understand – to a giant, you’re a dwarf

I got a thing for them big trucks
Big, fine bitches with good jug and big butts
5, 4 mommies with nice head and fake tits
That don’t get loose off Goose and probably act up
5, 7 bitches with bowlegs that take dick
All they really need is like two pills and 6 blunts
Wake up in the morning and count money and make grits
She don’t really know no English so we don’t say shit
(Mack Maine) Yeah, Wayne said let it rain on them (I did)
Mother nature with the paper, doing a Mack Maine on em
Like, there go 1000, like swoosh
Like, there go 2000... (ballin)
Now shake that ass like you can’t
Pay your cable bill and you tryna watch the Saints
On the 60 inch Hitachi, living like Liberace
Sporting the latest Versace, shotty and Maseratis
Dodging the paparazzi, AC cold like the heart of Nazis
This here a classic like old school Hirachis
Then get your grill cooked like it was Hibachi
Word to cousin Rodney

[Hook]
I said my niggas gon ride if there’s drama about me
It ain’t about a murder than it ain’t about no beef
Cause all we know is homicide, nigga I’m a G
And if them pussys looking for me they can find me in the street
I said my niggas gon ride if there’s drama about me
It ain’t about a murder than it ain’t about no beef
Cause all we know is homicide, nigga I’m a G
And if them pussys looking for me they can find me in the street

[Verse 1]
I said my niggas gon ride if there’s drama about me
I told em “line up boys and put the ladders in the street”
And it gon be a homicide, somebody got to bleed
That chopper hit him 20 times, put that boy up on a tee
Now RIP, last nigga that played got his pussy ass sprayed
Now he stiffer than a stone, bones chilling in the grave
Hey, I’m lighting Philly when I blaze
Bullets smack him in his head, had blood dripping through his waist
I’m a North sider rapper, South sider rider
My niggas move for me, but ain’t nothing like my chopper
Where they at? Right there, pull up when we spot em
See them niggas running, if he trip I know I got him
I’m riding for my niggas that’s down for me
And when I die, nigga don’t cry, just bust your pound for me
Yea, like open bar boy, you give em round for free
If they ain’t riding, get em round for me

[Hook]
I said my niggas gon ride if there’s drama about me
It ain’t about a murder than it ain’t about no beef
Cause all we know is homicide, nigga I’m a G
And if them pussys looking for me they can find me in the street
I said my niggas gon ride if there’s drama about me
It ain’t about a murder than it ain’t about no beef
Cause all we know is homicide, nigga I’m a G
And if them pussys looking for me they can find me in the street

[Verse 2]
I’m like, same niggas used to be speaking, now they grilling
Osama asked me what it’s hitting for, I’m like kill em
Fuck em, shoot em in they face, make em suffer
We smoke em, then we joke about them pussy motherfuckers
Strapped up, I’m never sleeping
I’m on point, and better him than better me
Memory, forever sleep, an enemy, can never be
A threat to me, a stress to me, if he ain’t got the breath to breathe
All we know is murder homicide
Kill him on his doorstep and really make his mama cry
Leave her traumatized, let them holler fly
Rock a baby boy to sleep, that chopper singing lullabies
If it ain’t about a murder I ain’t heard of it
We don’t do the hospitals, we do funeral services
And gymnastics get a nigga’s casket dirty
In other words we laying niggas out, you heard me

[Hook]
I said my niggas gon ride if there’s drama about me
It ain’t about a murder than it ain’t about no beef
Cause all we know is homicide, nigga I’m a G
And if them pussys looking for me they can find me in the street
I said my niggas gon ride if there’s drama about me
It ain’t about a murder than it ain’t about no beef
Cause all we know is homicide, nigga I’m a G
And if them pussys looking for me they can find me in the street

[Verse 1]
Hey everyone, listen up, your attention if you please
Really wanna give you a warning 'cause I found out this morning
'Bout a dangerous, insidious computer virus
If you should get an e-mail with the subject "Stinky Cheese"
Better not go taking your chances
Under no circumstances should you open it or else it will
Translate your documents into Swahili
Make your TV record Gigli
Neuter your pets and give your laundry static cling

[Pre-Chorus]
Look out! It's gonna make your computer screen freeze
Look out! Erase the Easter eggs off your DVDs
Look out! Erase your hard drive and your backups too
And the hard drive of anyone related to you

[Chorus]
Virus alert! Delete immediately before someone gets hurt
Forward this message on to everybody

[Verse 2]
Soon, very soon, it will make all the paint peel off your walls
It'll make your keyboard all sticky, give your poodle a hickey
And invest your cash in stock in Euro Disney
Then, it will tie up your phone, making prank long-distance calls
It'll set your clocks back an hour and start clogging the shower
So just trash it now, or else it will
Decide to give you a permanent wedgie
Legally change your name to Reggie
Even mess up the pH balance in your pool

[Pre-Chorus]
Look out! It's gonna melt your face right off your skull
Look out! And make your iPod only play Jethro Tull
Look out! And tell you knock-knock jokes while you're trying to sleep
Look out! And make you physically attracted to sheep
Look out! Steal your identity and your credit card
Look out! Buy you a warehouse full of pink leotards
Look out! Then cause a major rift in time and space
And leave a bunch of Twinkie wrappers all over the place
That's right, it's a

[Chorus]
Virus alert! Delete immediately before someone gets hurt
Forward this message on to everybody
Virus alert! Delete immediately before someone gets hurt
Forward this message on to everybody
Warn all your friends, send this to everybody
Tell everyone you know, tell everybody now

[Bridge]
If you get infected, you'll wish you had never been born
So before it emails your grandmother all of your porn
Turn off your computer and make sure it powers down
Drop it in a 43-foot hole in the ground
Bury it completely, rocks and boulders should be fine
Then burn all the clothes you may have worn any time you were online

[Chorus]
Virus alert! Delete immediately before someone gets hurt
Forward this message on to everybody
Virus alert! Delete immediately before someone gets hurt
Forward this message on to everybody
Virus alert! Delete immediately before someone gets hurt
Forward this message on to everybody
Warn all your friends, send this to everybody
Tell everyone you know, tell everybody now

Reminiscing on days that I didn’t have shit
Just to book me for a show that’s gon cost you a half a brick
If I ain’t had that haze, baby know I had that white
The DA want to roof a nigga like a satellite
Cause I was up and trapping, trapping ‘fore I grabbed the mic
And I had the 38 special ‘fore I had the Mike’s
And I was riding on niggas ‘fore I had a bike
I tell a nigga he a bitch like a hermaphrodite
I got bad bitch dollar sign appetite
You kept me on the corner shine like a traffic light
Yeah, on post like a mail box
Cops watch my every move and I don’t even sell rock
Just a couple months ago, I was on the cell block
Me and Peed, Gunna state rolling in the cell lock
Whole hood know I’m flame, they say that I’m hell hot
Drop 50 on you, cops see the semi shell shot
And you gon rat like Splinter
Catch you wrong time, nigga snatch your whole dinner
I was down for the summer, Imma grind the whole winter

Yeah

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
So what'cha waiting for, anticipating more
While you debate what it could take to instigate a war?
Yeah, I been hated more than time I wasn't hated for
There's nothing they can fucking say they didn't say before

But you could never see it, your battle's not mine
Wanna skate and play it safe, but this is take a shot time
While you're waiting for a purpose, I already got mine
While you tell me step to it like "one, two, three, four"

[Pre-Chorus: Page Hamilton & Chester Bennington]
And if I do what you demand
(You say!) You'll let me understand
(You say!) You're gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away
(You say!) I'll have no debt to pay
(You say!) I'm gonna get what I deserve

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Your word, obeyed
My debt, repaid
Our trust, betrayed
All for nothing! All for nothing!

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Kick back, there's no other way to say it
So let me break this fucker down for you, I really don't know you
You talk, but let me show you where to put your paranoia
You're joking, I don't have a half a sucker bone to throw you
I'm disgusted
Wonder what could've made you tuck your tail below you

And no, I'm not your soldier, I'm not taking any orders
I'm a five-star general infantry controller
Need a lesson? Let me show you
Have you checking your composure
While I make you step to it like "one, two, three, four"?

[Pre-Chorus: Page Hamilton & Chester Bennington]
And if I do what you demand
(You say!) You'll let me understand
(You say!) You're gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away
(You say!) I'll have no debt to pay
(You say!) I'm gonna get what I deserve

[Interlude: Page Hamilton]
And if I do what you demand
You'll let me understand

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Your word, obeyed
My debt, repaid
Our trust, betrayed
All for nothing! All for nothing!
All for nothing! All for nothing!

[Outro: Mike Shinoda & Brad Delson]

[Mike:] “We're (going?) too far”

[Brad:] “I don't think we're too far”

[Mike:] “We are”

[Brad:] “There's a difference. Put the heavy shit there”

[Mike:] “The heavy shit right here?”

[Verse 1]
Your love is bright as ever
Even in the shadows
Baby, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Your heart is glowing
And I'm crashing into you
Mhh baby, kiss me, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Before they turn the lights out
Oh, baby, love me lights out

[Chorus]
In the darkest night, I'll
I'll search through the crowd
Your face is all that I see
I'm giving you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out

[Verse 2]
Oh, we don't have forever
Baby, daylight's wasting
You better kiss me
Before our time has run out, oh
Nobody sees what we see
They're just hopelessly gazing
Oh, baby, take me, take me
Before they turn the lights out
Before time has run out
Oh, baby, love me lights out

[Chorus]
In the darkest night, I'll
I'll search through the crowd
Your face is all that I see
I'm giving you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
Oh, you can turn my lights out

[Bridge]
I love you like XO
You love me like XO
You kill me girl XO
You love me like XO
Is all that I see
Giving you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out

[Chorus]
Oh, in the darkest night, I'll
I'll search through the crowd
Your face is all that I see
I'm giving you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
Oh, you can turn my lights out
Fargo
Put the money in the duffle and sit yo bitch ass down, how bout that?

Aye that’s yo boo, boy I know you love er
I can’t say but don’t do Danny Glovers
I was stashin paper in my granny covers
I ain’t tryin to date, I just want petties from er

Every time I walk inside the trap I need a new kitchen
Thuggin up the pots, I need some new dishes
Take yo bitch to Chili's, I be at Ruth Chrissin
She can’t fuck with me unless a roof missin
Bitches is waving, a nigga ignoring
I’m sorry I gotta go hard on my interest, I’m whippin’ a foreign
Number 6 on the Jordans, I got your bitch on my organ
I might have an orgy, and just pick from the orges
It’s Tory I do it, I’m poppin’ a magnum in Story to prove it
I love my money, bitch I love my money
These hoes wanna put me on Maury to lose it
SO del uno, he told me to do it
Fuck out of towners that don’t know the movement
Roll with them hitters, you don’t know I do it
I hit then I Insta the photo to prove it
I kill these niggas fuckin with my Philly niggas
On that dream chase, even Millie fuckin with me nigga
All my doors slap jaws over silly nigga
Really get em, put em on ice like vanilla with em
Niggas talk straight, they ain’t never hood
Sound like Ye, they ain’t never could
And uh, maybe I fuck a broke bitch
But only if her credit good
Uh, top money I got it
And a nigga hand talk funny, I’m ridin
But anytime I see cops comin I’m quiet
Cause I ain’t tryin to see who talk to me through the wire
You ain’t never gotta talk, pussy nigga you on fire
Do or die and he’s with me pullin up the suicides
You a liar, who am I? You and I both know
Nigga you don’t blow no smoke
Hold no scope, hoes do my chores no joke
Walk through the door, no hopes, no strings, no rope
Fuck niggas throw things, hoes feelin so cold
Me? I’m a nigga, no joke
Me, I’m in the big time league nigga
Multiplyin all the big top G niggas
You these niggas tryna play me on a map though
18, 6 top three nigga
I done came from the bando to the basement
And you real but yo chain on that fake shit
When I’m standin on the money bitch I’m A6
And my chick better than cake mix
Yo chick could scam on that fake shit
Her Instagram need a facelift
I’m back in the street on that take shit
I’m back in the heat if you say shit
These niggas fowl and I ain’t playin Broady
Send the wap, no I ain’t playin on it
30 thou on this Laker game but if I lose the bet then I ain’t payin homie
Ridin round with that new Beretta
Don’t believe me? Aks VC nigga
Hit the town with my new vendetta
You got Stevie Wonder, try see me nigga
Put yo money up, nigga put it down
Go to school wit ya, you a juggernaut
See you soft then, you a pussy now
Take a look at me, take a look around
See the clique with me, gotta shook em now
See the grip with me, I don’t look around
Every chick with me had to book em out
But I hit em all and never took em out
I can go 100 years on the beat
Go until the top, all them niggas undefeated
What about all them other niggas underneath you that they talk about it to me, motherfucker let me see it
Bad woman, let me beat it
I could never eat it
Only if she got a millie in a villa real city
Yea these niggas say they ball hard
I never see the kush still I’m rockin quarter for the sign of a speed up damn
Nigga
Hit it up

[Verse 1]
I'm not really the type of nigga to play the gangsta
Cause you's probably coolin'
But straight off the motherfuckin breast
I ain't comin for no foolishness
100 volts on the mic kept knowin' (?) then I'm probably chillin'
Tilt that crazy off bottle 'til I'm blitzed
Look-a here nigga yall know that feelin'
But I ain't that type of nigga to shoot the shit if you on my shit list
But I'm that type of nigga that's quick to handle my business
Im makin' a run with shit that I've done
Im wavin' a gun at shit that you've brung
Make niggas get brung strung and hung with the slip of a tongue
I unfold a truck-load as I explode
You bitches can't hold the side-door when I'm in my front-load
Im keepin'em (??) I'm keepin'em hype
I'm leavin'em right I'm even uptight
Holdin' the mic and say the word FUCK more times then Dolomite
I'm the nigga that got the last words you got served
Smokin' fat herbs and gunnin' niggas down like black birds
With fast words, observe I'm funky like raptures
But I'm much much more then a mouth full of adverbs and bad words
Stick dick to your lips like chop sticks
My (?) I rock with with
More paid well no fade but bout colder than a cub of Kool-Aid
It never been done before so nigga then why try
Hittin' harder then Popeye slappin' motherfuckers like Cha-Cha
I fuck with a capitol "F" put (?) to death (??) crowd def
And I'ma continue to flow until I come up on my last breath
So homie raise up (OH!)
Hold these tricks up (OH!)
See I'm that nigga that tells whether or not a nigga stay now look here

[Hook: Mystikal & Michelle Tyler] (x8)
I'm not that nigga
I'm not that nigga
I'm not that nigga to fuck

[Verse 2]
You'll get picked off
Keep fuckin' with a nigga like me get hip-tossed
Fuck fightin' fair get every nigga I know
And jump your bitch ass like Kriss-Kross
And look at a riddle that I belittle
When I'm a jumbo now a fiddle
I jump in your eardrum and play (?Baradiddle?)
Stop wanting to ditch'em
I'm in this bitch and comin' out rich
In case yah haven't noticed I'm 'bout a foul mouth son of a bitch
Inch by inch as I drench
I'm a sense clench
That bullshit that yall niggas throw is equivalent to the pain of a pinch
I got the gimmick to make them bitches bounce like DJ Jimmy
They can't get near me cause they fear me but yall don't hear me
It's like that bitch I saw
Who hit my fucking car
Look-a-hear, I ran that ho from Chippawa to Witchita
I'm steady for 'fessin, so niggas can kick this funky lesson
I'm effervescent as a fluorescent from that fuckin' crescent
A nigga that know how
Making them bitches say, "Go Child"
Poppin' that pussy and shakin' that ass just like they at a luau
So come with the pussy the paper the pen and the pussy now pass me the mic
Show you around jump on yo' ass just like a (???)
I shot more shit than Shawn Kemp but got more bitches than a world pimp
And got more flavor than a brown shrimp
I'ma be comin' up on some shit that make a nigga wanna talk some shit
But if you ain't brought shit
Then I ain't the nigga to start shit with

[Hook]

You couldn't fuck with the old but all of a sudden what make you think you can fuck wit the new shit
You stuck on stupid
I ain't that nigga to fool with
A nigga might sprout up talkin' about what
The only way to keep my muthafuckin' name out your muthafuckin' mouth
Is keep your muthafuckin mouth shut
I don't step (?) fire then a gutter
I'm takin'em 10 at a time cause I ain't SCARED of you muthafuckers
I'm strippin'em up
I'm rippin'em up and flippin'em up
And just to continue to flow on rhymes I single and double and triple'em up
Making passes
See massive titties and pussies and asses
But got more hoes than the Bayou Classic
More vicious then BooBoo wash you up like we do
I'm blacker then Voo-Doo, harder than a raw Ramen noodle
Black like Sheep, I'm Cool like Jay in effect like Rex
I'm Grand like Pub huh, huh daddy how you?
I'm Ice like T, rock like Kim fuck it
Spice like One but got more Enemies then the Public nigga
I kick it at random standing and dumpin until the band come
Bitchin and pitchin a temper tandrum, to the hand drum
The bigger opponent nigga that flow
You can't compare a nigga like Mystikal to Skidrow or Ugly Kid Joe
But yet you steadily pickin dirt with me
You irkin' with me you jerkin' with me now  tell your bitch to stop flirting with me
Im (?) as a man I'm strong as a fan belt, I can't melt
I know y'all niggas can't fuck with me cause I can't fuck with my damn self
I'm making em mumble as I utter
Nigga you beating me is like cuttin' a field of grass with wire cutters I
Get deeper than Lou Rawls Im breakin em off
Inatead of fuckin' with me you faithful walk in a lion's den with pork chop drawers
I'm ready to graze and blaze pump up the gauge and pick up the pace
I'm more deadly then having safe sex, with a bitch with AIDS
A nigga like myself is bad for your ho health
I fucked that bitch one time and now that ho can't help herself
That shit be kicks and niggas be smokin' in cliques and fuckin'em tricks
I rollin' from that Big Easy
Where the buddha B-yotch? and niggas they rumble, over the least mumbo-jumbo
Standing taller than Mutumbo but talkin more shit than Briant Gumble
That's how we do it when we kick it back on my block
It's pop or get popped
Kill or get killed
Drop or get dropped
And niggas be wondering why they always finding themselves in some dumb shit
Cause I ain't, cause I ain't, cause I ain't that nigga to fuck with bitch

[Hook]

[Spoken Intro]
On the streets of LA
Where the future is now
We dance like nobody is watching us
And we live like we want to
But it can also get a little crazy
Unless there's something to hold on to
For me, that was true love

[Verse 1]
I was a young girl, selfish and wild
Like a fire in L.A
Hot like the summer and mean like a child
Who keeps crying 'til she gets her way
(Like a true star)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There were roses in my hair
Rock and roll on blare and I was in trouble
No one could rock me like you could
I was a bad girl gone good

[Chorus]
Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
And it brought me to my knees
And it's all because of you
(You know what I'm talkin' about)

[Verse 2]
It was a mad world, we lived for fun
And we got shit for free
Had a face like an angel but inside my heart
Was as black as a broke movie screen
(It was pretty sad)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But then I saw you standing there
Like a millionaire, give me your number
Call me before I get stupid
Make me uncrazy like you did

[Chorus]
Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
But you brought me to my knees
And it's all because of you

[Bridge]
It isn't hard to see you've got a hold on me
Give me your money, love me to death
Talk like a baby cause I'm so elated
He tell me that I ain't seen nothing quite yet
I don't wanna lose it
I'm in love but I didn't choose it

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Roses in my hair, dancing in the air
Feels like I'm flying
Tell me you love me, boy, do it
It's just like I thought, I just knew it

[Chorus]
Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
You bring me to my knees
And it's all because of you
Yeah, it's all because of you

[Intro: Chester Bennington]
No control, no surprise
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty
I fuck up everything I see, fighting in futility

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
We start the final war, tell me what's worth fighting for
When we know there's nothing more
We take the hand or fist just to sell ourselves for this
The path we least resist

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No control, no surprise
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty
I fuck up everything I see, fighting in futility

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I give you what you came for, this is not the same though
Got a different method, but I still can bring the pain, so
Y'all all get that same flow, I got that insane flow
High as y'all can get, you're never really in my range though
Yes, I'm half Anglo, half-fried panko
All prime-time rhymer, let the bass bang low
All you fucking lames go aiming at my name, know
Careful what you shoot because you might hit what you aim for
Careful what you shoot because you might hit what you aim for

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No control, no surprise
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty
I fuck up everything I see, fighting in futility

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
No control, no surprise
Tossed the keys to the kingdom down that hole in my eye
I'm my own casualty
I'm my own casualty

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
"I'm not allowed to say certain things! AHH!"
Try and do... Try and do the other thing, real quick

[Intro: Chester Bennington]
One, two
One, two, thank you

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's no peace, only war
Victory decides who's wrong or right
It will not cease, only grow
You better be prepared to fight

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And it will not apologize
For laying down your life

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
War

[Verse 2]
There's no pain, it will spare
Fear has become your only right
And once you're lost, in your despair
Forever black eternal night

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And it will not apologize
For laying down your life

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
War, destroyer
War, destroyer

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
It needs no side to justify
Laying down your life

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
War, destroyer
War

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's a fragile game we play
With the ghosts of yesterday
If we can't let go, we'll never say goodbye
No trace of what remains
No stones to mark the graves
Only memories we thought we could deny

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
There was so much more to lose
Than the pain I put you through
In my carelessness, I left you in the dark
And the blood may wash away
But the scars will never fade
At least I know, somehow, I made a mark

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the dark, in the light
Nothing left, nothing right
In the dark, in the light
Nothing left, nothing right

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the dark, in the light
Nothing left, nothing right
In the dark, in the light
Nothing left, nothing right!

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Nothing right!
Nothing right!

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Today, we stood on the wall
We laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns
We laughed at it all
And when they, they told us to go
We paid them no mind like every other time
But little did we know

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Today, I looked for a sign
With flames in my hands
A line in the sand between yours and mine
And it came like fire from below
Your greed led the call, my flag had to fall
But little did you know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you've
Pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours and face your crime
You'll tell them, "Give me back what's mine"
"Give me back what's mine!"

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I'd never been a coward, I'd never seen blood
You'd sold me an ocean, and I was lost in the flood
We were counting on a leader, we were driven by need
But couldn't take temptation, and we were blinded by greed

You were steady as a sniper, we were waiting on a wire
So we never saw it coming when you ran from the fire
You can try intimidation and you can try to ignore
But when the time comes calling, yeah, you are gonna get yours

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you've
Pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours and face your crime
You'll tell them "Give me back what's mine"
"Give me back what's mine!"

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And so today, your truth has come
You're gonna pay for what you've
Pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours, you're out of time
And you will give me back what's mine
Give me back what's mine!

[Post-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Give me, give me back what's mine!
Give me, give me back what's mine!
What's mine!
Give me, give me back what's mine!
What's mine! What's mine!
Give me back what's mine!

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Today, we stood on the wall
We laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns
We laughed at it all
And when they, they told us to go
We paid them no mind like every other time
But little did we know
God Blesser
Word Processor
I'm in the nerd I professor
Like confessions but I never snitch
I'm never this
I never swerve off the road and fall into a ditch
But if I did like my car accident I kid
Khalifa, I see ya
And two things I'll never be, I never been a repeater
Always solo, no no, I live like a hobo
Work for billions, maybe millions, not a trillion
Maybe like a trillionaire, have you seein' things that aren't really there
And have you searching for it, this, look
Like my homie thought drug dealing, Kick, Push, how so?
On the outro, so long, on my first shit without 'cha
I'm still the shit, without hoes
Without toilets never spoil it
Royalties trying to oil me
The royal penis is clean your highness
I look down at my finest
Blinded by the shininess of my dick
That's how good she do it
I had it, but I lose it
Losing, that's Lu, that's still my name
I still got fame and no shame, uh
My shit is wild, it's never tame
Your shit is child, your shit is trash, I'll take your chain
Like 50 on stage, Summer Jam shit got me going in the rage!
But then I turn another page
I don't smoke, but I sure do blaze
Blaze niggas like I'm Just Blaze on the beat
MPCs bangin' in the streets
I'm too deep for these niggas to weak
Never sweet and no hurt shes
I'm no Hershey's but her shes love me so

[?] niggas like "Wurd!"
Yours is not better than mine
I ain't gotta curse, fine
Shit, fuck, damn, pussy, other expletives
I never rest, you gonna need sedatives
Shit don't registers
I am like a teller with propellers, I fly
And I count cash fella
I bounce pass shout to Dame Dash, yella
Yes sir, it's like a MC for NWA NGs mp3s
I keep 45 calibre's, HKs and MP3s for these Gs
Shout to GDs, shout to BDs and MC and Mickey Cobras
We need the peace treaty for the summer
Free Rondo! By him a condo, shout out to Lil Durk
OTF Nunu rest in peace
Hope you just was a lil hurt, nothing you need to get snubbed over
Put the guns down like Chance say
You see Beyonce on the knees, yea

[?]
You see me ride through the hood in the Maybach, stay back
Glocks shootin' way back my aim's too far
I'm too far gone, 

[?] my arms, yea, they reach

Shout out to Nipsey Hussle, shout out to my boy Ty Dolla

I'm from the 'Go, never stop, on the row
Gettin' dough on the low
Lupe Fiasco

[Intro]
Yeah, girl, I don't want you to hold back any longer, baby
'Cause tonight, I'm gonna give you all the things
I know you've been waiting for
So, brace yourself, and listen

[Verse 1]
I hear you calling, here I come, baby, to save you, oh oh
Baby, no more stalling, these hands have been longing to touch you, baby, woo
And now that you've come around, to seeing it my way
You won't regret it, baby, and you surely won't forget it, baby
It's unbelievable how your body's calling for me
I can just hear it calling, calling, calling for me

[Chorus]
My body's calling for you (baby, I can hear it calling, baby)
My body's calling for you (your body's calling me)
My body's calling for you (oh, oh)
My body's calling for you (come on, baby)

[Verse 2]
Tell me, what's your desire, baby, your wish is my will, oh yes, it is
Baby, let me take you higher and show you how you should feel, baby
Oh, so I speak now and forever hold your body
Whatever it is you want from me, lady
You see you don't have to say nothing, I know when your body wants something
And it's easy for me to see that your body's calling for me

[Chorus]
My body's calling for you (oh, oh, I hear it calling me)
My body's calling for you (I can hear it calling me)
My body's calling for you (oh, oh, oh, calling me)

My body's calling for you (and I like it, baby, it's yearning for me)
My body's calling for you (yes, it is, you see I'm wild enough to know)
My body's calling for you (when a body's yearning, for me, yeah)

[Intro]
It's your boy Meek Milly
More Flamers
The In My Bag Remix
Me and Gilly the Kid
Cash do you know what we did too, we flamers
Make sure you call up the radio, request that
Yamean? It ain't too much rap
DH boys, we in the building, and they ain't drop that shit

[Verse 1]
When we first met, I was just a Sophomore
We spent the night on Lydia’s couch
I didn't know you were gonna break my heart then
I didn't know the pain I’d feel right now

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I smile, yes I smile
But underneath are memories
That I’m trying, yeah, I’m trying
To let go

[Chorus]
But it’s not that simple
Type of misery
All these mixed up signals
In my head
I still hear these echoes
Of when you loved me
But now you’re just someone in my mind
That used to be mine

[Verse 2]
People used to say I didn't deserve you
I was cool with that, cause I felt the same
But then they played my song on the radio
And I don’t think you liked who I became

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And so you left, yeah, you left
On someone else's arm now
And I’m trying, yeah, I’m trying to let go

[Chorus]
But it's not that simple
Type of misery
All these mixed up signals
In my head
I still hear these echoes
Of when you loved me
But now you’re just someone in my mind
That used to be mine

[Bridge]
'Cause baby, your beauty marks
Are like shooting stars
In my goofy heart is one of Cupid's darts
I’m just a nervous guy
And these words of mine
Won't reverse the time
To when you were mine

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it’s not that simple
Type of misery
All these mixed up signals

[Chorus]
No, it's not that simple
Type of misery
All these mixed up signals
In my head
I still hear these echoes
Of when you loved me
But now you’re just someone in my mind
Now you’re just someone in my mind
That used to be mine

[Bridge]
Drank, drank, drank, drank
Lean, lean, lean
Oil, oil, oil, oil
Mud, mud, mud, mud

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Had my first drank on my birthday
Was a whole pint
Gucci Mane you must be thirsty
Cuz' you can sho' drank
Niggas say the Wop broke
Must be an illusion
Gucci got the narc work
Mess with the conclusion
Gucci got the good wood
Wanna walk the damn plank?
Fuck around with PeeWee
And damn that boy can sho' drank
Her pussy sweet
Her pussy kiwi
I poured it on her hole
I told her ride me like it's PE
And suck it until she can't
Got her smoking on that good weed

[Intro]
Free my nigga lil
BH

[Verse 1]
I fell in love with the streets, yeah I was 16 (youngin)
Grinding like Clipse, tryna get cream (let’s get it)
A little nigga in the field, was doing big things
Big hammers, big work, and had a big team
It was popping round the time we had it in green
Yeah we was dirty, narcs tryna sweep the strip clean
Plus we had that white girl, you know, that Christine
Aculera, that should dare her, make a rich fiend
Go broke tryna fix dreams
Watching niggas cook the coke it looked like whipped cream
And I was tryna get cake (I was hungry)
My old head would tell me just wait
But I was crooked, tryna get straight
The hundreds with the big face
The money made me feel great
Like Tony the Tiger, when he get flakes
Talking the frosted ones
My heart was so cold had to defrost my lungs
Getting high, was paranoid and going hard with guns
Ready to squeeze on any nigga with ease
Nightmares of being murdered I believed
How the judge gon blame me
Cause when them niggas come to kill me nobody gon save me
Label me a felon ‘fore you label me as telling
Upstate jail and tuna soup and getting melon
Tell em, was raining yesterday but now it’s hailing
It’s death up in the air, you can smell it
Man they got the reaper round the corner tryna catch a body
The hungry youngins up the street they tryna catch somebody
Slipping, they got their smith and they gon stretch some bodies
If they don’t get paid, somebody gon get sprayed
And one love to my niggas in the twist cage
No commissary chow without the lid tray
Guard spit in it, but you can feel your rib cage
Touch it so you’re like fuck I got to live today
You niggas fucking with them hoes, I’m fucking with them Benjis
I be cutting up them O’s, fucking with that stove
That shit you made last week, I fucked it up on clothes
Spend half of that on Prada and the other half on dros
Woah! (woah Meek Milly!)
I said nigga do you, Imma do me
That haze it got him in the zone like a 23
Them niggas need a smoke, we got that oohwee
Purp by the pound, ounces of the sour D
We 32’d the Glizzy’s, compact to max
Sliding through they hood, tinted down, back to back
Looking for these pussys, now where these faggots at
Skis, dickies, and hoodies show where they trapping at
Murder murder graveyard, funeral service for em
Embalming fluid, obituary and hearses for em
That choppa do him, his mama mourning and hurting for him
We collect bosses, they flunkies, whoever working for em

[Outro]
Yeah, Meek motherfucking Milly
You niggas know what it is
BH we straight to the motherfucking day that I die nigga
Free my nigga lil
GT franchise we got the game on motherfucking lock
And if you think you fucking with me nigga, hit that stu' hard
And get your fucking game right
Plain and simple
Boss

[Intro]
Ay Snoop Dogg
Ay ay ay Snoop Dogg~!
We the people, wanna know
What's it like to be a boss mayne?
I mean, what's it really like to walk in yo' shoes mayne?

[Snoop Dogg]
(Yo!) This ain't no cake walk nigga
Your cuz keep it pimpin man I made y'all niggas

I'm 19 in, kush and a Swisher
(Yo!) Cash by the bundles and bundles at wholesale
No bail the feds tryin to give me mo' jail
But I'm a superstar, ridin in my super car
Ponytail swangin, gangbangin, lookin super hard
(Yo!) I wake up every day and blow a zip
Count grams, contraband on my HIP
Outstanding with my pimp hand, handing me my GRIP
Outlandish on my tip like nigga this Crip
(Yo!) The bouelvard star, red carpet walker
So +Famous+, feelin like +Amos+
Fuck the police, one time cain't contain us
I'm rich as a motherfucker ain't I? Ain't I?
(Yo!) I'm the boss and you know dat
Send two I send 'bout fo' back, dead
(Yo!) Don't let the names do you wrong
I'm so involved with the heat I need meds
(Yo!) My whole life is like a video
I make good music like really doe
Standin on my own two, lookin at you suckers, what'chu gon' do?
{*shhhhhh*} Ballin ain't a thing that's what I'm gon' do
(Yo!) Back at 'em, the 'llac with a chandelier
With a +Foxy+ bitch, I call her Pam Grier
(Yo!) This my part of town, you can't stand here
You say you gangster? The Runners gettin ran here
Chop 'em up, sit 'em down, please don't disturb the Dogg
Ain't worth the call, shit I ain't even heard of y'all
The nerve of y'all, to face what you cain't see
I don't give a fuck who went down, she he ain't me
(Yo!) Khakis creased, All Stars, blue barette
So much money on him shit the city tried to sue the set
Boss Dogg, here I go, hoggin in my own lane
In 1988, I was cookin up the whole thang
(Yo!) And now I'm involved with slangin raps
Million dollar deals, movies and countin stacks
The critics try to fight the facts
But I'm loved everywhere, go and fight that
(Yo!) I think they love it when I'm trippin
That pop shit make it hard to listen
(Yo!) But when it sounds like this
It make a nigga wanna pop his clip in, now listen
(Yo!) Turn that beat up, that bass got 'em feelin froggy
Quit your talk, I got homies bigger than John Coffey
(Yo!) And they'll tear this whole place up
Got gangsters puttin on makeup, ya dig?
(Yo!) The West coast king is on his shit again
They in panic like "How do we get rid of him?"
The answer is you cain't
And even if you could, then motherfucker you ain't
Beitch!
He SKIRT around the issues, he SKIRT when I'm around
Cause his worst don't work when I'm around
At worst he a round from a pistol around a missile
A pack of peppers around a pound of pickles
A pound around a soundless nickel around town soft as down
And wouldn't put sound through a whistle
A clown that I would to love see wear a crown of sickles
Who comes out to the sound of crickets
And buys his own tickets to his rounds to diss you
You hear the distant sound of different styles of life you wish you Had but too bad, you had the chance
But now you can't even get an ass to kiss you?
The issue is you fight on the wrong side of the tissue
You supposed to be the shit, not try and shit on THE shit
And sit on the wrong side of da pistol
I'd really like to stick you with the drawing side of a pencil
Or stab chisels right into the side of ya mental
That makes them boring rhymes you into
Some of the homies is gay
Maybe we can all get together and make you a closet
Go to Home Depot this weekend
You know really make it a project
Diz, I would love to get you in da ring and make you a hobbit
But you ain't even religious
So why would I put these crosses on you just make you a profit?

Eminem riddled everyone by posting the squared picture of "The Equalizer" on Instagram - the movie with his favorite actor, Denzel Washington.

Just a day later, trailer has arrived.

It features Sia's singing and Eminem, most likely, singing a bridge to song. This snippet would be from their second collabo, with "Beautiful Pain" being first.

Eminem is most likely to do a full soundtrack, maybe even a music video for this song and/or make a cameo.

Stay tuned for more info on the song. As for the movie, it's coming 26th September.

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Rat nigga got my chain snatched
And he didn't even get the chain back
On the news with the police, now he talking on twitter I ain't playing that
Fuck all that Meek you gotta chill shit

Oh lord oh lord what you yelling nigga
Penthouse nice fresh out the cellar nigga
All that white like what you selling nigga

I be on money since nineteen, twenty
I may be twenty-one I have bout 3hunnid
And I ain't talking bout Chief Keef or Lil' Reese
But all my niggas keep heat a little piece
With a drum on that bitch no chicken all beef
For you fuck ass rappers that be talking they all sweet
Last night I hit my hood with all my chains on
Two hundred fifty thou had a Mulsanne on
A broke nigga get it from me and his pain gone
But he'll never get it from me he'll get rained on
I tell em wear it to your funeral be stuntin' while they viewing you
Everybody goons 'til we send that 32 at you
Sipping on lean with the percs pharmaceutical
Just so I can get in my bag in the studio
Headshot we ain't shooting low
So many holes in ya they gone call you Julio
Oops I mean Hole-I-O, Holyfield knows he’s broke
Shooting at your Rolls Royce turn it to the holy ghost
Holy smokes, caught the whole thing that was overdose
Overkill watched the news so I know its real

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
That's why I'm like fuck y'all niggas
Cause I ain't never trust y'all niggas
And I be like fuck y'all bitches
And I'll never cuff y'all bitches
Cause these hoes ain't loyal and niggas ain't either
When it go down you calling for hittas that you ain't feeding
You ain't real nigga
Your day ones ain't even still with you
You left them starving you an ill nigga
Same niggas you calling to kill with you
But I be in the field nigga
And when it come to money I get it
I fill up banks like Uncle Phil nigga word
Word fuck these bitches get a bird serve
Whoever got it never splurge splurge
Cause when the money going that's when all the honeys rolling
They gone kick you to the curve

[Outro: Meek Mill]
One time for Lil' Snupe R.I.P
Whole squad on that real shit
And you know I was always taught
If them niggas ain't feeding you how you going to ride for them

Loyalty before royalty

Heels on me saying gimme 6 inches of space
Courtside while designer frames cover my face
Now everybody in the game wanna get 'em a taste

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I'm in Brazil with a bitch
Catch me in a mansion in the hills with a bitch
Get her out them tennis shoes, throw some heels on a bitch
I’m the type of nigga split a mil with a bitch
Hold up, only if she bad though
Out here trying to find someone that better than my last ho
Take her to my castle, drown her in my cash flow
Say your dick so little she can fit it in her asshole
Told me she can't ride this shit no further than a cab go
Said I got that dumb dick, she wanna be my tutor
So she give me brain, getting head on the scooter
Had sex on the beach from Bermuda up to Cuba
I done fucked a lot of dimes but I’m looking for a cuter bitch
You the shit, what she say when she got to sit
When I ain't around, give a damn who you do it with
Super thick, pretty face, ménage à veinte
20 at the same time, wanna get ya rent paid?

[Intro: B.o.B]
I don't do much talking, let the money do it for me
And I don't need no promo, cause the haters do it for me
I just tell it how it is, while they be telling stories
When you come up from the bottom, that just mean that you was chosen

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hey now you know I don't do no talking, I let my diamond do it for me
But I'm blowing on loud, yea that's another story
Catch me in the building on the 37th story with a bad bitch screaming like I'm bringing her to glory
Glory, yup, we the bank roll mob, she can run from the dick but she can't go far
I'm in the Dominican Republic, got a couple bitches fucking on some cherry red seats and a mango card
A mango card? I know you heard about that, still a dope boy got birds on deck
Talking parakeets though, cause you a stool pigeon know you can't wait to run and spread the word bout that
And I never will let 'em, a pussy nigga keep me from being dope boy fresh
And they ain't gon' get it cause it is nigga, you can bet the bank on that

[Hook: B.o.B]
I don't do much talking, let the money do it for me
And I don't need no promo, cause the haters do it for me
I just tell it how it is, while they be telling stories
When you come up from the bottom, that just mean that you was chosen
(And what it mean when you come up from the bottom?)
That just mean that you was chosen
And I don't need no promo, cause the haters do it for me
I just tell it how it is, while they be telling stories
When you come up from the bottom, that just mean that you was chosen

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
I can bet every chain on every verse I ever wrote, on every phrase on every note
No wedding ring, but I'm married though to the game for forever more
You in the game but you never score, in every lane I'm exceptional
I'm on a plane where you never go
And they tell me that life is a bitch but I much prefer mary jane as a better ho
Aye, you see most of y'all niggas just fake to me, stories made up like Maybelline
My niggas good for life, y'all still trying to get from point A to B
And they say silence is golden, so my wrist be talking shit for me
And haters can't help but hate, shit I can't help but be chosen

[Hook: B.o.B]

[Verse 3: Spodee]
A up on my fitted cap, my momma told me always give the critics (snap)
Balling with the homies they can try and run up on me
We gon' start tripping like they invented maps
Jordan's with denim vests, spending more than your mortgage on Vino Pet
Roll up the cigars, amino fat
Not so big, hunnits come out the side
She ain't sucking dick, she gotta jump out the ride
Another one that's choosing, that's the one I'll oblige
Focus on the money, only vocal for the moment
Niggas scavenging the hunger, wondering how I survived
For them beat the double but the triple
Burn em like a griddle, play a sucka' nigga like a fiddle
I don't say a word if I'm a kill em
Soon as I get the watch, just put em in the Nets Kerry Kittles

[Hook: B.o.B]

[Intro]
Go!

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
This love is so dangerous
But I kind of like the thrill
It's like a sugar rush
It's all in the way you make me feel
I didn't see you coming, but you broke me down
'Cause you got some nerve about you
Walk up like I know you
Both hands and your tattoos
One smile, and oh

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
I gotta admit you're fly
And I love it how you talk, babe
Getting all in my mind
Running it like a field play
I didn't see you coming
But you broke me down
'Cause you got some nerve about you
Don't you walk up like I know you
Both hands and your tattoos, and

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
This ain't no ordinary boy
This ain't no ordinary boy
See the funny thing about you
You got me doing things I wouldn't do
You ain't no ordinary boy
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
I, deep down know I should be good
I ain't blind, you're the kind of guy
That always got all these girls running after you
Do I entertain or play with you? Or just be cool?
'Cause you got some nerve about you
Walk up like I know you
Both hands and your tattoos
One smile, and oh
Don't sleep, I think I'ma burn too fast
So close, wrapped up in the heat of love
I'm having fantasies of how it's gonna be
'Cause you got some nerve about you
Walk up like I know you
Both hands and your tattoos, still

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
This ain't no ordinary boy
This ain't no ordinary boy
See the funny thing about you
You got me doing things I wouldn't do
You ain't no ordinary boy
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux

[Verse 4: Nas]
Yo, got Henny in the cup, Jenny knows what's up
She with a real one, not pretending to be tough
Got three cases, might have a warrant I don't know about
Beef I don't know about, weed I can't go without
My money used to pile up every beginning of the month
Unconditional love, in the beginning it was lust
Hustler, shooter, was a dealer on the block
Now my future's on top, no longer dealing with the thots
I don't go nowhere without the handle
Like I heard Lil' Boosie was out in Louisiana
Got friends in the feds, some dead over drugs
Fucking with me is high-risk but she still in love (We in love, baby)
Benny Medina might wanna pay me to leave ya
I'm bad for your image, the ghetto menacing diva
'Cause some say Nas is trouble
We all in, just ignore them nice guys is boring, I got you

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
This ain't no ordinary boy
This ain't no ordinary boy
See the funny thing about you
You got me doing things I wouldn't do
You ain't no ordinary boy
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You gon' be troubeaux
The Roc is in the building
Homegirl Mela
So I don't miss a thing

[Kanye West]
Now the Roc in the buildin', UIC Pavilion
Two years ago I was just a civilian
Now every chick in here swear I got millions
In area codes with unidentified children
Hear barbershop talk, niggas want to kill him
Throw my hoodie on, blend in like chameleons
Take my hoodie off, they like "What up Ye, you chillin'?"
Swear to god they just like children
Just like high school, back at my school
Just like Halloween, minus the costumes
The nigga that's flickin' be the ones that's trickin'
The girls two seatin' be the ones that's treatin'
Do a test on relationships, everybody cheatin'
I used to want the Jordans most recent
Throw Jordans on the truck now just to look decent
Just for me and Mela, derci-arrive

[Intro: Kanye West (Monica)]
Yo Monica, I know you shootin' that video in there
Aw, you just ain't gon' let me in the video, huh?
No no, i-it's me, Kanye West (It's funny how the tables turn)
You know, th-throw your diamonds up? Through the wire? (turn)
You ain't seen my video, heh? (turn, turn)
You know, I- like me and Missy we did this song
Together whatever
Um, okay, well

[Interlude: Kanye West]
I can't keep knockin' and keep rockin' and keep poppin'
I keep droppin' and keep poppin' and keep rockin'
But I can't keep knockin' and keep knockin'
And keep poppin' and keep rockin'
Let's get it poppin'

[Missy Elliot {*overlaps Kanye West Interlude*]
So upset
This that hot shit
Uh huh, yeah
New Monica!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Now you ain't let me in the video (true)
Play me like Semi did Arsenio (true)
I'm Kanye from the Chi city yo (who?)
I'm the nigga that did the beat yo
You know we too old for this like Holyfield still boxin'
Ya will watch and I look back, ya still watchin'
What he got that I ain't got? I got Benz
I got rims, not 20s but I got 10s
Real real clean, come and get your rear wheel cleaned
She did what with who? Man I hear things
Like when I was doin' my dirt and she heard things
Up worryin' while she wore her ring
Now she got a fling and where's her ring?
That 

[?VVS?] is in the purse now, feelin's in the dirt now
Somebody buyin' the bar, quenchin' her thirst now
Somebody bought her a dress, she in the church now
And what's worse now, she ain' gotta work now
She cuffed an NBA player from the first round
I grabbed her neck and made it hurt to breathe
She said "Security, this jerk could leave"
And uh

[Verse 2: Monica]
So do just what you want anytime that you really like
I put a payment on my place, you'll be sleepin' alone tonight
So don't you come knockin'

[Hook (Monica)]
Knock knock knock, stop knocking
Don't come knocking at my do'
(Don't you come knockin' at, whoa)

But you gon' turn your beauty right into a beast (Uh)
Now, this is the business or pleasure, let's keep 'em separate (Separate)
I ain't tryna be second, just for the record (Record)
I see you slippin' you trippin', thought I should let you know
I admire your effort but I need better love
See many men try to play me 'til they get scared away (Right)
I told 'em that's a fall, try out another day (Right)
This is different, now I'm seeing that it isn't (Mmm)
Promise I'm not gon' cry here like Mary J
Now ain't that funny, that you was something special 'til
I noticed that you just like these losers who come in severals
But I, know that if you leave you comin' right back
So my question boy is, why you acting like that?

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
Been down for you, don't get it confused

[Intro: Trae]

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
I'm the man in my city like biggie, so haters they probably can't stand him
Should've been part of the opera the way that I play in the Phantom
This bird on my seat kind of bright for me, fuck it I told them to tan em'
First rapping nigga that powered the streets so the radio banned him
I'm looking for something to surf on the night with a body so vicious
If she not fucking I tell her get lost and I send her the worst of my wishes
I'm helping my niggas get dinner we eating, they talking bout dishes
Fuck with my money I'm pricing your head, blow the rest on these bitches
Nigga we made it
Nigga we made it
Nigga we made it
Nigga we made it
Try to keep that on the low, cause them people find out we gon' probably get raided
Find me a tutor, head game was smart to the point I was searching for knowledge
She just got her masters, something amazing you would think she fresh out of college
Shout out to Drizzy and OVO, and this shit I just got from Tokyo
That alley hoop helped me, I'm finna' score
Gotta let my nuts hang on before we go
I'm patiently waiting, swang is patiently skating
Just incase they ain't hear what I stated, I ain't worried
My niggas we made it

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Nigga we made it, aye
We made it
Nigga we made it, aye
Damn, we made it
Nigga we made it, aye
We made it, aye
Nigga we made it, aye
We made it

[Verse 2: Drake]
She said she workin' for Walgreens but not in the store, at the head office
The head was so good it makes sense why you work at the head office
In 2007 I sat in the lobby of Motown and waited
Now I walk into the buildin' and go off like "Nigga we made it!"
When I walk through these halls, man this beat should be playin'
I just came to make sure you not missin' no payments
Now turn this shit down while I issue my statement
It needed a moment of silence, nigga we made it!
You fly out your lady, I fly out my latest
Bitches can't front on the kid anymore, man they know what my name is
And if by chance she don't know who I am, she just know that I'm famous
I'm a just hand her a business card and say, "Nigga we made it!"
And she gotta come through the hotel and pop it off for me
Then she gon' text her best friend like "Girl he got some good dick and money"
Her friend hit her back like "I know that already, that nigga's amazin'"
Then I send a message to both of they asses like "Nigga we made it!"

[Hook: Young Thug]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'm a save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'm a call my partner 'fore her, I fuck her mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each other
Every time I fuck, I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Boy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet, just like two midgets

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
Who the fuck told them that Trae not the king of the streets, shit I rep like no other
Yea I get money like Diddy, but everything else by me came out the gutter
That's why I pull up with no ceilings like Weezy, yelling fuck a hater no rubber
Dare one of you pussies to run up on me, it be over put that on my mother
I-I am not backing down, hang up my chopper, no fucking round
Fucking with me, I'm a shut it down
Bullets come flying, no ducking down
Won't nothing be funny, I'm not a clown
Have killers and (jail) niggas touching down
Shut the fuck up, not a fucking sound
You no longer shit cause I'm back in town
Money so long, I ain't got a fucking limit
Haters get brushed, name shit (shouldn't been in it)
Hoes ain't shit, give em' back like they rented
Trusain bolt, every night I run up in it
Everything black, presidential lose city
Niggas can't see me like a young nigga tinted
Home town temple, for the crown I'll win it
Stay on point, other niggas can't pin it

[Hook: Young Thug]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'm a save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'm a call my partner 'fore her, I fuck her mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each other
Every time I fuck, I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Boy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet, just like two midgets

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Who the fuck told you that Young Thugger Thugger don't fuck up the beat?
I got six cars and I also got rentals and all of 'em tinted
No, I'm not Nipsey, not from L.A., but I got keys to the city
I fuck it, I suck it, I beat it down, then she beat me to the ceilin'
Stoner my lifestyle, I'm livin' too wild
I came to make you proud, that money keep her around
In love with her head, I can't turn it down
Can't wait for my time to come back around
She see that you don't got Lil Haiti's style
Plus I just seen Snoop on Girls Gone Wild
I just bought a Bentley and a bitch came with it
Young rich nigga hittin' million dollar licks
Balling in New York like a motherfucking Knick
You better have them racks, you ever want to hear me spit
And everywhere I go I got a pass like the staff
I'm goin' off top like a motherfuckin' lay up
357, six shots like Al
I left ten bands in a motherfuckin' cab

[Hook: Young Thug]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'm a save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'm a call my partner 'fore her, I fuck her mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each other
Every time I fuck, I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Boy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet, just like two midgets

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Every time I come out I ain’t never with no new bitches
These bitches is stealing, I'mma sue bitches
Dripping down his dick, this pussy too vicious
Every time I fuck him I say "Whose is it?"
Who the fuck tell 'em that they was like Nicki? Oh no, bitches didn't!
I'mma give bitches a minute of shine then I'll tell 'em good riddance
To raise a child, it might take a village
But I wouldn't know cause these bitches my sons; yes, they was, and they still is
Gave him the kitten, now that nigga smitten
Told him to hop in my foreign and then I said "No, I'm just kiddin'!"
Hell of a livin', you bitches on chitlins
When I come out of my mansion I sprinkle some bread to the pigeons
Bitches is lyin', they lyin', they lyin', they lie in they bio
So I ain't fuckin' with chickens unless I got pico de gallo
Girls is plottin', what more could they steal?
Tell Justin Timberlake that I am comin for Jessica Biel
Bitch I'm a star-rah, you niggas, I holla tomarrah
Doors go up cause I am too rich to cop a Gallardo
No regular doors, on Aventadors
Painted it pink just so I could take pictures while you rented yours
Hell of a ticket, hell of a price
I want it, I get it, I wire the money, I never think twice
I am not gay, but lesbi precise
Cause if she pretty, then watch it cause I'mma be fuckin' ya wife

[Verse 4: T.I.]
Ok, cool, ok, bu, I love her
I'mma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'mma call my partner befo' I fuck the mother
I pay them in molly, now kiss each other
Everytime I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Boy, tha doppy whip, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got 2 digits
Money stand like 8ft, just like 2 midgets
So shawty gonna trippin get some new chicks
Let me tell you what I did
And I bought a new whip
Filled it with some cute, bitches
While they was on IG, taking a new pic
I was in the bushes in the Valentine day
With a K, tryna shoot Cupid
Think im playing, for the cab 50 bands
And whateva's stacked in that Minnie Van
You pro'ly can't relate to what I'm saying, yall niggas
Talking up foul
I do some shit you pro'ly neva did in yo life
Well I don't talk about it
Trust me now, nigga, cause you ain't 'bout that life
Hustle Gang nigga, got a pro'lem with that?
Bring the motherfucking mob and the pro'lem begins
If you ever leave from me, ain't no circling back
I bet your bitch hang up the phone, you be callin' her back
Go hard as a mother fucker
Getting head from a couple broads in this motherfucka
Ain't no more fuckin credit cards in this motherfucka
Bank Roll count 50 large in this motherfucka

[Intro: Jennifer Lopez]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

It's a countdown

It took you too long to find out
What you want right now

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Now that you're tuned in
I suggest you zoom in
And claim Puff dead
I'm out the tomb then
I'm married to the game like the bride and the groom is
If you don't want to move then leave the room here
See you the type of nigga believe the rumors
But I'm the type to show y'all what the truth is
And show you how the coupe is
And you don't know where the roof is
And the interior is stupid
So I'mma shoot my shot and just do it
Cause I can't stop my love for the music
Been a decade since Biggie dropped "Juicy"
When I think back sometimes I still lose it
And feel the ambiance
From the screams of the audience
And y'all response

[Chorus: John Legend]
I'ma give it everything I got, just to stay on top
For the love of the block, cause it's still part of me
And we from Harlem, we
Gonna give it everything I got, just to stay on top
For the love of the block, cause it's still part of me
And we from Harlem, we

[Interlude: Termanology]
Cause we can't stop, and you don't stop, cause you can't stop
What's up, rap world
I figured I'd take this opportunity to look outside of myself and say
What would I say if I was them

[Verse 2: Termanology]
9-1 Heavy D, 9-2 Mary J
No more Uptown
Bad Boy on the way
9-3, 9-4 B.I.G.'s in the door
9-5 making hits, Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique
Craig Mack, "Flava in Ya Ear"
Don't stop there, Lil' Kim posing in the panties and a brassiere
Sayin' "Biggie Biggie give me one more chance
"Biggie Biggie give me one more chance" ah man
Fly chicks, rolling in fly whips
9-6 Bad Boy invented the remix
These hits got the whole world loving my clique
They loving the sound
The whole world hitting my hit
9-7 Big passed and he went up to heaven
Only on the second album he already a legend
Man I wish Big could've seen the world in '07
Matter of fact sometimes I wish I just died with him

[Chorus: John Legend]
I'ma give it everything I got, just to stay on top
For the love of the block, cause it's still part of me
And we from Harlem, we
Gonna give it everything I got, just to stay on top
For the love of the block, cause it's still part of me
And we from Harlem, we

[Outro: Termanology]
I miss him
He's still part of me

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Them niggas talking reckless I get them gunned down
Choppa style goons lurking when the sun down
Niggas throwing bullets trying to get a touchdown
You catch them like Fitzgerald nigga when that clip spill
I've seen niggas go upstate with wills
Beat their appeal make it home then get killed
Cause shit real nigga up in Philadel
I wet you and leave a hole in your head like killer whale
Free Willy and Meek Milly
He really bout that ask a nigga vouch that
Pussy nigga softer than a pillow top mattress
Rappers actors like Samuel L. Jackson
Niggas throwing money, they don't even own a crib yet
And they ain't send no money to their niggas doing the bid yet
You ain't even buy that Playstation for your kids yet
But you making it rain you a fucking lame

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I got a bullet with ya name on it
Catch you slipping sunny day come and rain on it
Niggas talking that shit 'til we slide up on them start sparking that shit
You get a concrete pillow in the coffin for your bed
I have niggas looking for you like there's money on your head
I'ma kill you when I catch you I'ma kill you ya

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I hear them pussies talking
They talking reckless about me
But when I see them niggas I going to catch some wreck a body
I'm talking shots fired, got a man down
Coppers walkie talkie, over stand down
Shots still shooting choppers still chopping
I ain't trap in like a year but the block still popping
Niggas hating on me they don't got an option
Cause I'm shining perfect timing
Like a diamond VVS shit
Niggas can't fuck with me I'm like their ex bitch
I'm on that homicide ride or die x shit
44 revolver wild wild west shit
Niggas talking reckless now they on my wreck list
Death wish bullets hit your front back exit
Ya hollow heads just to bobble heads
And if we spot him there then we drop him there

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I got a bullet with ya name on it
Catch you slipping sunny day come and rain on it
Niggas talking that shit 'til we slide up on them start sparking that shit
You get a concrete pillow in the coffin for your bed
I have niggas looking for you like there's money on your head
I'ma kill you when I catch you I'ma kill you ya

[Verse 3: Manny Wellz]
Many many men

But fuck a vest I keep a tec up on me
Fuck his chest I hit his head hit his face and hit his neck when I squeeze

Look we really do this here
We all shooters here
Thirty rounds in that four pound Ruger ya
Come through here like you gon' talk shit out
You won't be walking out you be walking down
Bullets pounding from front to rear
Doctors yelling clear and the nigga flatline
He been dead shots hit his chest came out his backside

Take them to their stash spot
Search the premises until some money holler jackpot
I'm on my own, thirty shots in the clip of my chrome
I'm on your top little niggas is on
I know some real live street niggas I can hit on the phone
And get you shot broad day in your dome

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I got a bullet with ya name on it
Catch you slipping sunny day come and rain on it
Niggas talking that shit 'til we slide up on them start sparking that shit
You get a concrete pillow in the coffin for your bed
I have niggas looking for you like there's money on your head
I'ma kill you when I catch you I'ma kill you ya

[Verse 1]
See that girl, bare-footing along
Whistling and singing, she's a carrying on
There's laughing in her eyes, dancing in her feet
She's a neon-light diamond and she can live on the street

[Chorus]
Hey hey, hey, hey, come right away
Come and join the party every day
Hey hey, hey, hey, come right away
Come and join the party every day

[Verse 2]
Well, everybody's dancing in a ring around the sun
Nobody's finished, we ain't even begun
So take off your shoes, child, and take off your hat
Try on your wings and find out where it's at

[Chorus]
Hey hey, hey, hey, come right away
Come and join the party every day
Hey hey, hey, hey, come right away
Come and join the party every day

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Take a vacation, fall out for a while
Summer's coming in, and it's going out of style
Well, light up smoking honey, have yourself a ball
'Cause your mother's down in Memphis, won't be back 'til the fall

[Chorus]
Hey hey, hey, hey, come right away
Come and join the party every day
Hey hey, hey, hey, come right away
Come and join the party every day
Hey hey, hey, hey, come right away
Come and join the party every day
Hey hey, hey, hey, come right away
Come and join the party every day

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round
It trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind
I like to blow away
But the heat came round and busted me
For smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]

[Brige]
Coming, coming, coming around, coming around, coming around in a circle
Coming, coming, coming around, coming around, in a circle
Coming, coming, coming around, coming around, in a circle

[verse 2]
Escaping through the lily fields
I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded
Left a bus stop in its place
The bus came by and I got on
That's when it all began
There was cowboy Neal
At the wheel
Of a bus to never-ever land

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
We need so damn many things
To keep our dazed lives going
Many things to keep our lives
Lives going, so many things
We need so damn many things
(We need so damn, we need so damn many things)
To keep our stupid lives going
(Keep our stupid, keep our stupid lives going)
Many things to keep our lives
(To keep our lives, to keep our lives, many things)
Lives going, so many things
(So many things, so many things, lives going)

[Verse 2]
We can be bound, run around
(We can be bound, we can be bound, run around)
Fooled animal bite it's tail
(Fooled animal, fooled animal bite it's tail)
Animal, he has been bound
(He has been bound, he has been bound, animal)
Run around, around and 'round
(Run around, round, run around, round, run around)

[Verse 1]
We need so damn many things
To keep our dazed lives going
Many things to keep our lives
(To keep our lives, to keep our lives, many things)
Lives going, so many things
(So many things, so many things, lives going)
Many things to keep our lives
Lives going, so many things

[Verse 1]
Dark star crashes
Pouring its light
Into ashes
Reason tatters
The forces tear loose
From the axis
Searchlight casting
For faults in the
Clouds of delusion

[Chorus]
Shall we go
You and I
While we can?
Through
The transitive nightfall
Of diamonds

[Verse 2]
Mirror shatters
In formless reflections
Of matter
Glass hand dissolving
To ice petal flowers
Revolving
Lady in velvet
Recedes
In the nights of goodbye

[Chorus]
Shall we go
You and I
While we can?
Through
The transitive nightfall
Of diamonds

[Verse]
High green chilly winds and windy vines
In loops around the twining shafts of lavender
They're crawling to the sun
Wonder who will water all the children of the garden
When they sigh about the barren lack of rain and
Droop so hungry 'neath the sky, Ai-yi
Underfoot the ground is patched
With climbing arms of ivy wrapped around the manzanita
Stark and shiny in the breeze
William tell has stretched his bow
'Til it won't stretch no furthermore
And/or it may require a change that hasn't come before
No more time to tell how, this is the season of what
Now is the time of returning with our thought
Jewels polished and gleaming
Now is the time past believing the child has relinquished the rein
Now is the test of the boomerang tossed in the night of redeeming
Seven faced marble eyed transitory dream doll
Six proud walkers on the jingle bell rainbow
Five men writing with fingers of gold
Four men tracking down the great white sperm whale
Three girls waiting in a foreign dominion
Riding in the whalebelly, fade away in moonlight
Sink beneath the waters to the coral sands below

[Verse 1]
Without a warning you broke my heart
Taking it baby, tore it apart
And you left me standing in a dark clime
Said your love for me was dyin'
So come on baby, baby please
I'm begging you baby, I'm on my knees

[Chorus]
Turn on your light, let it shine on me
Turn on your love light, let it shine on me
Let it shine on me let shine, let it shine, let it shine

When I get a little lonely in the middle of
The night
And I need you darling to make things all right
So come on baby, baby please
And I'm begging you baby, 'cause I'm on my knees
Turn on your lights let it shine on me
Turn on your love light let it shine on me
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

[Verse 2]
Without a warning, you broke my heart
Taken it baby, torn it apart
And you left me standing, in a dark clime
Said your love for me was dyin'
So come on baby, I'm on my knees

(Post-chorus)
Well I get a little lonely in the middle of the night

[Verse 1]
Why know death don't have no mercy in this land
Death don't have no mercy in this land, in this land
Come to your house, you know he don't take long
Look in bed this morning, children find your mother gone

[Chorus]
I said death don't have no mercy in this land
Death will leave you standing and crying in this land
Death will leave you standing and crying in this land, in this land, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Whoa! Come to your house, y' know he don't stay long
Why look in bed this morning
Children you find that your brothers and sisters are gone
I said death don't have no mercy in this land

[Bridge]
Death will go in any family in this land
Death will go in any family in this land
Come to your house, you know he don't take long
Look in the bed on the morning, children find that your family's gone

[Chorus]
I said death don't have no mercy in this land
Death will leave you standing and crying in this land
In this land. Whoa! Come to your house
Y' know it don't stay long, y' look in bed this morning
Children find that your brothers and sisters are gone
I said death don't, death don't have no mercy in this land

[Chorus]
Lay down my dear brothers, lay down and take your rest
Oh, won't you lay your head upon your savior's breast
I love you, oh but Jesus loves you the best
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

[Chorus]
Lay down my dear brothers, lay down and take your rest
Oh, won't you lay your head upon your savior's breast
I love you, oh but Jesus loves you the best
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

[Verse]
Walking in Jerusalem, just like John
(Bid you goodnight,  goodnight, goodnight)
I remember right well, I remember right well
(Bid you goodnight,  goodnight, goodnight)
His rod and his staff shall comfort me
(Bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
Tell "A" for the ark, that wonderful boat
(Bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
Tell "B" for the beast at the ending of the wood
(Bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
You know, it ate all the children that would not be good
(Bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)
Walking in the valley in the shadow of death
(Bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight)

[Chorus]
Lay down my dear brothers, lay down and take your rest
Oh, won't you lay your head upon your savior's breast
I love you, oh but Jesus loves you the best
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

[Chorus]
Lay down my dear brothers, lay down and take your rest
Oh, won't you lay your head upon your savior's breast
I love you, oh but Jesus loves you the best
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 1]
This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
About a quarter to nine
Hits river junction
At seventeen to
At a quarter to ten
You know it's traveling again

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 2]
Trouble ahead
A lady in red
Take my advice
You'd be better off dead
Switch-man sleeping
Train hundred and two
Is on the wrong track
And headed for you

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 3]
Trouble with you is
The trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But we still don't see
Come round the bend
You know it's the end
The fireman screams and
The engine just gleams

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Outro]
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind

[Verse]
You told me goodbye, how was I to know
You didn't mean goodbye, you meant please don't let me go?
I was having a high time, living the good life, well I know
The wheels are muddy, got a ton of hay
Now listen here, baby, 'cause I mean what I say
I'm having a hard time, living the good life, well I know
I was losing time, I had nothing to do
No one to fight, I came to you
Wheels broke down, leader won't draw
The line is busted, the last one I saw
Tomorrow come trouble, tomorrow come pain
Now don't think too hard baby, 'cause you know what I'm saying
I could show you a high time, living the good life, don't be that way
Nothing's for certain, it could always go wrong
Come in when it's raining, go on out when it's gone
We could have us a high time, living the good life, well I know

[Verse 1]
In the timbers of Fennario
The wolves are running 'round
The winter was so hard and cold
Froze ten feet 'neath the ground

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 2]
I sat down to my supper
It was a bottle of red whiskey
I said my prayers and went to bed
That's the last they saw of me

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 3]
When I awoke, the dire wolf
Six hundred pounds of sin
Was grinning at my window
All I said was, "Come on in"

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 4]
The wolf came in, I got my cards
We sat down for a game
I cut my deck to the queen of spades
But the cards were all the same

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
Don't murder me

[Verse 5]
In the backwash of Fennario
The black and bloody mire
The dire wolf collects his due
While the boys sing round the fire

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Outro]
No, no, no
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
Please don't murder me
Please don't dominate the rap, Jack
If you've got nothing new to say
If you please, don't back up the track
This train's got to run today

I spent a little time on the mountain
I spent a little time on the hill
Heard some say: Better run away
Others say: You better stand still

Now I don't know but I been told
It's hard to run with the weight of gold
Other hand I have heard it said
It's just as hard with the weight of lead

Who can deny? Who can deny?
It's not just a change in style
One step done and another begun
And I wonder how many miles?

Spent a little time on the mountain
Spent a little time on the hill
Things went down we don't understand
But I think in time we will
Do we keep on coming or stand and wait
With the sun so dark and the hour so late?

You can't overlook the lack, Jack
Of any other highway to ride
It's got no signs or dividing lines
And very few rules to guide

Spent a little time on the mountain
Spent a little time on the hill
I saw things getting out of hand
I guess they always will

I don't know but I been told
If the horse don't pull you got to carry the load
I don't know whose back's that strong
Maybe find out before too long

One way or another
One way or another
One way or another
This darkness got to give
One way or another
One way or another
One way or another
This darkness got to give
One way or another
One way or another
One way or another
This darkness got to give

[Verse]
I can't stay much longer, Melinda, the sun is getting high
I can't help you with your troubles, if you won't help with mine
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, I gotta get down to the mine
You keep me up just one more night, I can't sleep here no more
Little Ben clock says quarter to eight; you kept me up 'till four
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, or I can't work there no more

A lot of poor man make a five dollar bill, keep him happy all the time
Some other fella's making nothing at all and you can hear him cry
"Can I go, buddy, can I go down take your shift at the mine?"

Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
Gotta get down to the Cumberland mine
That's where I mainly spend my time
Make good money, five dollars a day
Made anymore, I might move away

Lotta poor man got the Cumberland blues he can't win for losing
Lotta poor man got to walk the line just to pay his union dues
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again

[Verse 1]
All of my friends come to see me last night
I was laying in my bed and dying
Annie Beauneau from Saint Angel
Say "The weather down here, so fine"

[Verse 2]
Just then, the wind
Came squalling through the door
But who can
The weather command?
Just want to have
A little peace to die
And a friend or two
I love at hand

[Verse 3]
Fever roll up to a hundred and five
Roll on up
Gonna roll back down
One more day
I find myself alive
Tomorrow
Maybe go
Beneath the ground

[Verse 4]
See here, how everything
Lead up to this day
And it's just like
Any other day
That's ever been
Sun going up
And then the
Sun, it going down
Shine through my window and
My friends, they come around

[Bridge]
Come around
Come around

[Verse 5]
The people may know but
The people don't care
That a man could be
As poor as me
Take a look at poor Peter
He's lying in pain
Now, let's go
Run and see
Run and see
Run and see
Run, run, and see
Hey, hey
See

[Verse 1]
I been ballin' a shiny black steel jack-hammer
Been chipping up rocks for the great highway
Live five years if I take my time
Ballin' that jack and a drinking my wine
I been chipping them rocks from dawn till doom
While my rider hide my bottle in the other room
Doctor say better stop balling that jack
If I live five years I gonna bust my back, yes I will

[Chorus]
Easy wind 'cross the bayou today
'Cause there's a whole lot of women, mama
Out in red on the streets today
And the rivers keep a talking
But you never heard a word it said

[Verse 2]
Gotta find a woman be good to me
Won't hide my liquor try to serve me tea
'Cause I'm a stone jack baller and my heart is true
And I'll give everything that I got to you, yes I will

[Chorus]
Easy wind going 'cross the bayou today
There's a whole lot of women
Out in red on the streets today
And the rivers keep a talking
But you never heard a word it said

[Verse 1]
The first thing I remember knowing
Was a lonesome whistle blowing
And a young'un's dream of growing up to ride
On a freight train leaving town
Not knowing where I'm bound
And no one could change my mind, but Mama tried

One and only rebel child
From a family meek and mild
Mama seemed to know what lay in store
In spite of all my Sunday learning
Towards the bad I kept on turning
'Til Mama couldn't hold me anymore

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame, cause Mama tried

[Verse 2]
Dear old Daddy, rest his soul
Left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Working hours without rest
Wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right but I refused

[Chorus]
And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame, cause Mama tried

And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame, cause Mama tried
That leaves only me to blame, cause Mama tried

[Chorus: Jerry Garcia]
Well, my mama told me, my papa told me too
Now my mama told me, Papa told me too
Well, I shouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

[Interlude: Jerry Garcia]
Oh!
Woo!

[Instrumental]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1: Jerry Garcia]
Well, I went to the depot, I never got there on time
Went down to the depot, never got there on time
Well, my train's going down, she's a-rolling down the line

[Verse 2: All]
Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies!
Mister jailer, go away, don't tell me no lies!
Well my train's going down, she's a-rolling down the line

[Interlude: Jerry Garcia]
Down the line

[Instrumental]

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Jerry Garcia]
Well, my mama told me, my papa told me too
Now my mama told me, Papa told me too
Well, I shouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust to nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just look to see the sights
I can tell your future
Look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While I'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Outro]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak daybreak on the land

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, West Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about half way
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they're loaded down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame;
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
High-low jack and the winner take the hand

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
My uncle starts winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
And I'm as honest as a Denver man can be

[Verse 5]
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
And I shot him down, lord he never saw
Shot me another, oh damn he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
And we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Verse 6]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I loved my uncle, god rest his soul
Taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

[Verse]
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
You ain't so big, you just tall, that's just about all
You got me working boss man, a working around the clock
I want a little drink of whiskey, you sure won't let me stop
Big boss man, can't you hear me when i call?
You ain't so big, you just tall, that's just about all
I'm going to get me a boss man, one going to treat me right
I work hard in the daytime, sure get drunk at night
You ain't so big, you just tall, that's just about all

[Verse 1]
Busted flat in baton rouge, waiting for a train
Feeling nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby flagged a diesel down, just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was blowing sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slapping time, Bobby clapping hands
We sang every song that driver knew

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to do
Nothing ain't worth nothing, but it's free
Feeling good was easy lord, when bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me, good enough for me Bobby McGee

[Verse 2]
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standing right beside me, lord, in everything I done
Bobby's body kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, lord, I let her slip away
Looking for that home, I hope she finds
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holding bobby's body close to mine

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing was all she left for me
Feeling good was easy lord, when bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me, good enough for me Bobby McGee

Lelela, lelelala, lelela, lelela, laleleha, laleleha, lalala
Leleleheee, lalala, leleleheee, lalala, leleleha, leleleha
Lala, lala, lala (heyyy)

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to do
Nothing ain't worth nothing, but it's free
Feeling good was easy lord, when bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me, good enough for me Bobby McGee

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back in the woods among the evergreens
There in an old cabin made of earth and wood
There lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar like ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go, go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go, go Johnny go, go, go Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit up in the trees by the railroad track
The engineers seen him sitting in the shade
Strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by would stop and say
"My my, but that little country boy can play!"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go, go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go, go Johnny go, go, go Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 3]
His mamma told him "someday you will be a man"
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Johnny B. Goode tonight

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go, go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go, go Johnny go, go, go Johnny B. Goode

[Verse]
Old man down, way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty, asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine, more than my maker, though he's no friend of mine
Everyone said, I'd come to no good, I knew I would pearly, believe them
Half of my life, I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The other half found me stumbling 'round drunk on burgundy wine
But I'll get back on my feet again someday
The good lord willing, if he says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should
I'll get up and fly away, I'll get up and fly away, fly away
Pearly's been true, true to me, true to my dying day he said
I said to him, I said to him, "I'm sure she's been."
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you."
Got up and wandered, wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just hang around
I've got a girl, named bonnie lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Verse 1]
I want to tell you how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I want to love you night and day
You know my love will not fade away

You know my love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're going to know just how I feel

Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, yeah, yeah
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Verse 1]
Going where the climate suits my clothes
I'm going where the climate suits my clothes
Going where the climate suits my clothes
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Well I'm goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Verse 2]
Going where the water tastes like wine
Well I'm going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Outro]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way
Well I'm goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Verse]
Well you know Katie Mae is a good girl
Folks say she don't run around at night
I made a mistake and she don't run around at night
Yes, you can bet your last dollar Katie Mae will treat you right
Well some folks say she must be a Cadillac
But I say she got to be a t-model ford
Well some folks say she must be a Cadillac
But I say she got to be a t-model ford
Yes, she got the shape alright, but she can't carry no heavy load
And she walks this life
Her daddy got oil wells in his backyard
Every time she got to working that woman she never has to work too hard
I say bye-bye poor Katie Mae
These are the last words I got to say
'Cause if I don't meet you tomorrow
I'll get you early in the next day

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be in some dark hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Then to be at home alone and knowing that you're gone
Would cause me to lose my mind

[Chorus]
Well blow your whistle freight train carry me far on down the track
Well I'm going away, I'm leaving today
I'm going, but I ain't coming back

[Verse 2]
I'd rather be in some dark hollow where the sun don't ever shine
Then to be in some big city, in a small room
With you upon my mind

[Chorus]
So blow your whistle freight train carry me far on down the track
Well I'm going away, I'm leaving today
I'm going but I ain't coming back
So blow your whistle freight train carry me far on down the track
Well I'm going away, I'm leaving today
I'm going but I ain't coming back

[Outro]
I'm going away, I'm leaving today
I'm going but I ain't coming back

[Chorus 1]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus 2]
Now, he's gone, now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone, like a steam locomotive
Rolling down the track, he's gone, he's gone
And nothin's going to  bring him back, he's gone

[Verse 1]
Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride
Hot as a pistol but cool inside
Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile
Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
Going where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
Lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

[Chorus 2]
Same old, rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus 2]
Ne

[Outro]
Like a steam locomotive
Rolling down the track, he's gone, he's gone
And nothing's going to bring him back, he's gone
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back

[2x]

[Verse 1]
I went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up into heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
Get prepared, there's going to be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, Hey! Saturday Night!
One more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night!

[Verse 2]
Everybody's dancing  down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, the whole place going to fly

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, Hey! Saturday Night!
One more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night!

[Verse 3]
Turn on Channel Six, the President comes on the news
Says, "I got no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues
His wife say "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know what to do
Crank up that old Victrola, put on your rocking shoes

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, Hey! Saturday Night!
One more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night!

[Verse 4]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought he'd have a big old party, thought he'd call it Planet Earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord, you'll know it when it comes
When the rock and roll music meets the rising, shining sun

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, Hey! Saturday Night!
One more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night!
Uh-huh, Hey! Saturday Night!
One more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night!

[Verse 1]
Up on the blue ridge mountains, there I'll take my stand
Up on the blue ridge mountains, there I'll take my stand
A rifle on my shoulder, six shooter in my hand
Oh lord, I been all around this world

[Verse 2]
Lulu, my lulu come and open the door
Lulu, my lulu come and open the door
Before I have to walk in with my old 'forty-four'
Oh lord, I been all around this world

[Verse 3]
Mama and papa, little sister makes three
Mama and papa, little sister makes three
They're coming in the morning, that's the last you'll see of me
Oh lord, I been all around this world

[Verse 4]
Hang me, oh, hang me, so I'll be dead and gone
Hang me, oh, hang me, so I'll be dead and gone
I wouldn't mind your hanging, boys but you wait in jail so long
Oh lord, I been all around this world

[Verse 5]
Up on the blue ridge mountains, there I'll take my stand
Up on the blue ridge mountains, there I'll take my stand
A rifle on my shoulder, six shooter in my hand
Oh lord, I been all around this world

[Chorus]
Wake up Little Susie, wake up
Wake up Little Susie, wake up

[Verse 1]
The movie wasn't so hot, it didn't have much of a plot
We fell asleep, out goose is cooked, our reputation is shot

[Chorus]
Wake up Little Susie
Wake up Little Susie

[Verse 2]
What are you gonna tell your mama
What you gonna tell your pa?
What are you gonna tell your friend when they say ooo la la

[Chorus]
Wake up Little Susie
Wake up Little Susie

[Verse 3]
Well I told your mama that you'd be back by ten
Now Susie, baby looks like we goofed again

[Chorus]
Wake up Little Susie
Wake up Little Susie, we gotta go home
Wake up Little Susie, wake up
Wake up Little Susie, wake up

[Vesre 4]
The bullfrog's sound asleep, wake up Little Susie and weep
It's four o'clock and we're in trouble deep

[Chorus]
Wake up Little Susie
Wake up Little Susie

[Verse 1]
Baby, here I am and I'm a man upon the scene
I can give you what you want, but you got to come home with me
I got a whole lot of good ole loving and I got some in store
When I get through throwing it on to you got to come back for more

[Chorus]
Boys and things will come by the dozen
Ain't nothing but drug store love
Pretty little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama, I'm sure hard to handle, now yes I am

[Verse 2]
Action speaks louder than words and I'm a man with great experience
I know you got another man, but I can love you better than him
Take my hand, don't be afraid I'm gonna prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free so won't you place your ad with me?

[Chorus]
Boys and things will come by the dozen
Ain't nothing but drug store love
Pretty little thing let me light your candle

[Outro]
Give it to me baby, I got to have it, some of your love
It's all I need, early in the morning, late in the evening

[Verse 1]
Red and white, blue suede shoes
I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do?
Give me five, I'm still alive
Ain't no luck, I learned to duck
Check my pulse, it don't change
Stay seventy-two come shine or rain
Wave the flag, pop the bag
Rock the boat, skin the goat

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Verse 2]
I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am
Been hiding out in a rock and roll band
Shake the hand that shook the hand of P.T. Barnum and Charlie Chan
Shine your shoes, light your fuse
Can you use them old U.S. Blues?
I'll drink your health, share your wealth
Run your life, steal your wife

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Bridge]
Back to back chicken shack
Son of a gun, better change your act
We're all confused, what's to lose?
You can call this song the United States Blues

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my
My my my oh my my my my
Summertime done, come and gone, my

[Verse 1]
A pistol shot at 5 o'clock
The bells of heaven ring
Tell me what you done it for
No, I won't tell you a thing

[Verse 2]
Yesterday I begged you
Before I hit the ground
All I leave behind me
Is only what I found

[Verse 3]
If you can abide it
Let the hurdy-gurdy play
Stranger ones have come by here
Before they flew away

[Verse 4]
I will not condemn you
Nor yet would I deny
I would ask the same of you
But failing will not die

[Verse 5]
Take up your china doll
It's only fractured
And just a little nervous
From the fall

[Verse]
Blue light rain, whoa
Unbroken chain
Looking for familiar faces
In an empty window pane
Listening for the secret
Searching for the sound
But I could only hear the preacher and the baying of his hounds
Willow sky, whoa
I walk and wonder why
They say love your brother
But you will catch it when you try
Roll you down the line, boy
Drop you for a loss
Ride you out on a cold railroad And nail you to a cross
November and more
As I wait for the score
They're telling me forgiveness is the key to every door
A slow winter day, a night like forever
Sink like a stone, float like a feather
Lilac rain, unbroken chain
Song of the sawhet owl
Out on the mountain, it'll drive you insane
Listening to the winds howl

[Outro]
Unbroken chain of sorrow and pearls
Unbroken chain of shy and sea
Unbroken chain of the western wind
Unbroken chain of you and me

[Verse 1]
Loose Lucy is my delight
She come running and we ball all night

[Chorus 1]
Round and round
And round and round
(And round and round and round)
Don't take much to get me on the ground

[Verse 2]
She's my yo-yo, I'm her string
Listen to the birds on the hot wire sing

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah, yeah) yeah
Singing, "Thank you
For a real good time!"

[Verse 3]
I got jumped coming home last night
Shadow in the alley turned out all my lights

[Chorus 1]
Round and round
And round and round
(And round and round and round)
Don't take much to get me on the ground

[Verse 4]
Loose Lucy, she was sore
Says I know you don't want my love no more

[Chorus 2]
Singing yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah, yeah) yeah
Singing, "Thank you
For a real good time!"

[Verse 5]
Be-bop baby, how can this be?
I know you been out and cheating on me

[Chorus 1]
Round and round
And round and round
(And round and round and round)
Don't take much to get the word around

[Verse 6]
Cross my heart and hope to die
I was just hanging out with the other guys

[Chorus 2]
Singing yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah, yeah) yeah
Singing, "Thank you
For a real good time!"

[Verse 7]
Went back home with two black eyes
You know I'll love you till the day I die

[Chorus 1]
Round and round
And round and round
(And round and round and round)
Don't take much to get the word around

[Verse 8]
I like your smile but I ain't your type
Don't shake the tree when its fruit ain't ripe

[Outro]
Yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah, yeah) yeah
Singing yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah, yeah) yeah
Singing yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah, yeah) yeah
Singing, "Thank you
For a real good time!"

[Verse]
The news is out, all over town
That you've been seen out running around
I know that I should leave her there
I just can't go Lord, You win again

[Chorus]

[3x]
This heart of mine, could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trustin' you was my great sin
I just can't go Lord, You win again

[Outro]
What can I do Lord? You win again

[Verse 1]
Out on the edge of an empty highway
Howling at the blood on the moon
Big diesel Mack come rolling down my way
Can't hit that border too soon
Running hard out of Muskrat Flats
It was sixty days or double life
Hail on my back like a shotgun blast
High wind chimes in the night

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, the Pride of Cucamonga
Oh, oh bitter olives in the sun
Oh, oh I had me some loving and I done some time

[Verse 2]
Since I came down from Oregon
There's a lesson or two I've learned
By standing in the road alone
Standing watching the fires burn
The northern sky it stinks with greed
You can smell it for miles around
Good old boys in the Greystone Hotel
Sitting doing that git on down

[Chorus]
Oh, oh the Pride of Cucamonga
Oh, oh silver apples in the sun
Oh, oh I had me some loving, and I done some time

[Verse 3]
I see your silver shining town
But I know I can't go there
Your streets run deep with poisoned wine
Your doorways crawl with fear
So I think I'll drift for old where it's at
Where the weed grows green and fine
And wrap myself around a bush of that bright, whoa, on Oaxaca vine

[Chorus]
Yes, it's me, I'm the Pride of Cucamonga
I can see golden forests in the sun
Oh, oh I had me some loving, and I done some time

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Verse 2]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Outro]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
You said you was hurting
Almost lost your mind
'Cause the man you love
Hurts you all the time

[Chorus]
But when things go wrong
Wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Verse 2]
You love him a little more
When you should love him less
Why pick up behind him
And take his best?

[Chorus]
'Cause when things go wrong
Wrong with you
It hurts me too

[Verse 3]
You love another man
Little girl, you know, you know I love you
But you love him darling
Stick to him just about like glue

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Well, he better leave you
Or you best put him down
'Cause you know, I just can't stand to see
See you pushed around

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
My baby gives me the finance blues
Tax me to the limit of my revenues
Here she comes finger-popping, clickety-click
She says furs or diamonds, you take your pick

[Chorus]
She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
Money money, money money money
Money money, money money money

[Verse 2]
She say, "Money, honey", I'd rob a bank
I just load my gun and mosey down to the bank
Knocking off my neighborhood Savings and Loan
To keep my sweet chiquita in eau de Cologne

[Chorus]
She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
Money money, money money money
Money money, money money money

[Bridge]
Mama, don't send me down to rob that bank again
I got a notion that you're leading me to sin
Won't you relax, won't you lay way back
Don't you bug your honey about no Cadillac
It's only bucks, you don't need no jack
So won't you please relax and lay way back

[Verse 3]
My baby's loving gives me such a thrill
It gives me inspiration making counterfeit bills
Now some folks say the best things in life are free
I sure don’t get no lovin' livin' honestly

[Chorus]
She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
Money money, money money money
Money money, money money money

[Verse 4]
Lord made a lady out of Adam's rib
Next thing you know, you got women's lib
Lovely to look upon, Heaven to touch
It's a real shame that they got to cost so much

[Chorus]
She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
Money money, money money money, woo
Money money, money money money
Money money, money money money
Money money, money money money

[Verse 1]
Just like Jack the Ripper, just like Mojo Hand
Just like Billy Sunday, in a shotgun ragtime band
Just like New York City, just like Jericho
Pace the halls and climb the walls and get out when they blow

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy
Ramble on Rose

[Verse 2]
Just like Jack and Jill, Mama told the sailor
One heat up, and one cool down, leave nothing for the tailor
Just like Jack and Jill, Papa told the jailer
One go up, and one go down, do yourself a favor

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy
Ramble on Rose

[Bridge]
I'm going to sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never going to end
I'm going to march you up and down along the county line
Take you to the leader of a band

[Verse 3]
Just like Crazy Otto, just like Wolfman Jack
Sittin' plush with a royal flush, aces back to back
Just like Mary Shelly, just like Frankenstein
Clank your chains and count your change and try to walk the line

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy
Ramble on Rose

[Bridge]
I'm going to sing you a hundred verses in ragtime
I know this song it ain't never going to end
I'm going to march you up and down along the county line
Take you to the leader of a band

[Verse 4]
Goodbye Mama and Papa, goodbye Jack and Jill
The grass ain't greener, the wine ain't sweeter
Either side of the hill

[Chorus]
Did you say your name was Ramblin' Rose?
Ramble on baby, settle down easy
Ramble on Rose
Ramble on Rose

[Verse 1]
Went to see the captain, strangest I could find
Laid my proposition down, laid it on the line
I won't slave for beggar's pay, likewise gold and jewels
But I would slave to learn the way to sink your ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 2]
Saw your first ship sink and drown, from rocking of the boat
And all that could not sink or swim was just left there to float
I won't leave you drifting down but whoa it makes me wild
With thirty years upon my head
To have you call me child

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 3]
The bottles stand as empty
As they were filled before
Time there was and plenty
But from that cup no more
Though I could not caution all
I still might warn a few
Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Outro]
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse]
Paradise waits on the crest of a wave, her angels in flames
She has no pain, like a child she is pure, she is not to blame
Poised for flight, wings spread bright, spring from night into the sun
Don't stop to run, she can fly like a lie, she can't be outdone
Tell me the cost, I can pay, let me go, tell me love is not lost
Sell everything, without love day to day insanity's king
I will pay day by day, anyway, lock, bolt and key
Crippled but free, I was blind all the time, I was learning to see
Help on the way, well, I know only this, I've got you today
Don't fly away cause I love what I love and I want it that way
I will stay one more day, like I say, honey, it's you
Making it too, without love in a dream, it will never come true
Honey, it's you
Making it too
Without love in the dream
It will never come true

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Cold iron shackles, ball and chain
Listen to the whistle of the evening train
You know you bound to wind up dead
If you don't head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 2]
Rich man step on my poor head
When you get up, you better butter my bread
Well, you know it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me?
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Drink all day and rock all night
Law come to get you if you don't walk right
Got a letter this morning and it, all it read:
"You better head back to Tennessee, Jed"

[Verse 4]
I dropped four flights and cracked my spine
Honey, come quick with the iodine
Catch a few winks down under the bed
Then head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me?
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 5]
I run into Charlie Phogg
He blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
My dog, he turned to me and he said:
"Let's head back to Tennessee, Jed"

[Verse 6]
I woke up a-feeling mean
Went down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned 'round and the letters read:
"Better head back to Tennessee, Jed"

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me?
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me?
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 1]
In another time's forgotten space
Your eyes looked through your mother's face
Wildflower seed on the sand and stone
May the four winds blow you safely home

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you where the four winds dwell
In Franklin's tower there hangs a bell
It can ring, turn night to day
It can ring like fire when you lose your way

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew

[Verse 3]
God save the child who rings that bell
It may have one good ring left, baby, you can't tell
One watch by night, one watch by day
If you get confused just listen to the music play

Some come to laugh their past away
Some come to make it just one more day
Whichever way your pleasure tends
If you plant ice you're gonna harvest wind

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew

[Verse 4]
In Franklin's tower the four winds sleep
Like four lean hounds the lighthouse keep
Wildflower seed in the sand and wind
May the four winds blow you home again

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
You'd better roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
You'd better roll away the dew
(Roll away)
Roll away the dew
You'd better roll away the dew
(Roll away)
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
(Roll away)
Roll away the dew

[Outro]
Roll away

[Verse 1]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
But I'm in no hurry, no
Rainbows end down that highway
Where ocean breezes blow
My time coming, voices saying
And they tell me where to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry 'bout me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where to go

[Chorus]
California
Preaching on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm going to shine

[Verse 2]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
It's going to be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
Seems so long I felt this way
And time sure passin' slow
Still I know I lead the way
They tell me where I go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry 'bout me
No, no, don't worry 'bout me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where to go

[Chorus]
California
A prophet on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm going to shine

[Bridge]
You've all been asleep, you would not believe me
Them voices telling me you will soon receive me
Standing on the beach, the sea will part before me
(Fire wheel burning in the air!)
You will follow me and we will ride to glory
(Way up the middle of the air!)

And I'll call down thunder and speak the same
And my work fills the sky with flame
And might and glory going to be my name
And men going to light my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry 'bout me, no
It's gonna be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
Seems so long I felt this way
And time sure passin' slow
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no

[Outro]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, time coming any day
No, no, no, no, no (ooh)
No, no, no, no (ooh)
No, no, no, no, no, no (ooh)
No, no, no, no, no, no (ooh)
No, no, no, no (ooh)
No, no, no (ooh)

[Verse 1]
There's mosquitoes on the river
Fish are rising up like birds
It's been hot for seven weeks now
Too hot to even speak now
Did you hear what I just heard?
Say it might have been a fiddle or it could have been the wind
But there seems to be a beat now I can feel it my feet now
Listen here it comes again!

[Bridge]
There's a band out on the highway
They're high stepping into town
It's a rainbow full of sound
It's fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody's dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands

[Verse 2]
Sun went down in honey
And the moon came up in wine
You know stars were spinning dizzy, Lord
The band kept us too busy we forgot about the time
They're a band beyond description
Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand
While the music played the band, Lord
They're setting us on fire
Crazy rooster crowing midnight
Balls of lighting roll along
Old men sing about their dreams
Women laugh and children scream
And the band keeps playing on
Keep on dancing thru the daylight
Greet the morning air with song
No one's noticed, but the band's all packed and gone
Was it ever there at all?
But they kept on dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on clap your hands

[Outro]
Well the cool breeze came on Tuesday
And the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancing
Full of singing and romancing
The music never stopped

[Verse 1]
Your rain falls like crazy fingers
Peals of fragile thunder keeping time
Recall the days that still are to come
Some sing blue
Hang your heart on laughing willow
Stray down to the water
Deep sea of love
Beneath the sweet calm face of the sea
Swift undertow

[Chorus]
Life may be sweeter for this, I don't know
See how it feels in the end
May Lady Lullaby sing plainly for you
Soft, strong, sweet and true

[Verse 2]
Cloud hands reaching from a rainbow
Tapping at the window touch your hair
So swift and bright
Strange fingers of light
Float in air
Who can stop what must arrive now?
Something new is waiting to be born
Dark as the night
You're still by my side
Shining side

[Bridge]
Gone are the days we stopped to decide
Where we should go
We just ride
Gone are the broken eyes we saw through in dreams
Gone - both dream and lie

[Chorus]
Life may be sweeter for this I don't know
Feels like it might be alright
While Lady Lullaby sings plainly for you
Love still rings true

[Outro]
Midnight on a carousel ride
Reaching for the gold ring down inside
Never could reach
It just slips away but I try

[Verse 1]
Arabian wind
The needle's eye is thin
The Ships of State sail on mirage
And drown in sand
Out in No-man's Land
Where Allah does command

What good is spilling
Blood?It will not
Grow a thing

Taste eternity
The swords sings Blues for Allah

[Chorus]
In'sh Allah

[Verse 2]
They lie where they fall
There's nothing more to say
The desert stars are bright tonight
Let's meet as friends
The Flower of Islam
The Fruit of Abraham
The thousand stories have
Come 'round to one again
Arabian night
Our gods pursue their fight
What fatal flowers of
Darkness spring from
Seeds of light

Bird of paradise - Fly
In white sky
Blues for Allah
In'sh'Allah

[Verse 3]
Let's see with our heart
These things our eyes have seen
And know the truth must still lie
Somewhere in between

Under eternity
Under eternity
Under eternity
Blue
Bird of paradise
Fly
In white sky
Under eternity
Blues
For Allah
In'sh'Allah

[Verse 1]
Firefly, can you see me?
Shine on, glowing, brief and brightly
Could you imagine? One summer day
That same night be on your way
Do you remember? Hearts were too cold
Seasons have frozen us into our souls
People were saying the whole world is burning
Ashes have scattered too hard to turn

[Chorus]
Upside out or inside down
False alarm, the only game in town
No man's land, the only game in town
Terrible, the only game in town

[Verse 2]
Passenger, don't you hear me?
Destination seen unclearly
What is a man deep down inside?
What a raging beast with nothing to hide

[Chorus]
Upside out or inside down
False alarm, the only game in town
No man's land, the only game in town
Terrible, the only game in town

[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Night time would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Black as the night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love
So in anger

I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts ran through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one, he looked like he could run
Up on his back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I

Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out through the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left

But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger that my fear of death

I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And as last here I

Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I've got to make it to Rosa's back door

Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride
But my love for

Felina is strong
And I writhe where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere, Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina

Good-bye

[Intro]
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
Well Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
She had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, you know he couldn't believe his mind
Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee
Said tell me where your strength lies, if you please
Then she spoke so kind, she talked so fair
That Samson said, Delilah you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength become as natural as any old man

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man ever has lived on earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 3]
Now Samson and the lion, they got in attack
And Samson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got hands up round the lion's jaws
He ripped that beast, killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

[Outro]

[3x]

[Verse]
Gazing at the fire
Burning by the water
Before he speaks
The world around us quiets
With eyes as sharp as arrows
And turning to the fire
He clears the air and cuts it with a feather
Many in a circle
Slowly round the fire
When he is gone
I want to know him better
No one is forsaken
No one is a liar
He plants the tree of life on our foreheads with water
He hums
There are drums
Four winds
Rising suns
We are singing and playing
I hear what he's saying
I remember breezes
From winds inside your body
Keep me high
Like I told you
I'll sing to them this story
And know why

[Verse]
Bringing me down
I'm running aground
Blind in the light of the interstate cars
Passing me by
The busses and semis
Plunging like stones from a slingshot on Mars
But I'm here by the road
Bound to the load
That I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars
Alone with the rush of the drivers who won't pick me up
The highway, the moon, the clouds, and the stars
The black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a life where nothing is new
Ah, Mother American Night, I'm lost from the light
Ohhh, I'm drowning in you
I left St. Louis, the City of Blues
In the midst of a storm I'd rather forget
I tried to pretend it came to an end
Because you weren't the woman I thought I once met
But I can't deny that times have gone by
When I never had doubts or thoughts of regret
And I was a man when all this began
Who wouldn't think twice about being there yet
The black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
And it speaks of a life that passes like dew
It's forced me to see that you've done better by me
Better by me than I've done by you
What's to be found, racing around
You carry your pain wherever you go
Full of the blues and trying to lose
You ain't gonna learn what you don't want to know
So I give you my eyes, and all of their lies
Please help them to learn as well as to see
Capture a glance and make it a dance
Of looking at you looking at me
The black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a lie that could almost be true
Ah, Mother American Night, here comes the light
I'm turning around, that's what I'm going to do

[Outro]
Going back home that's what I'm going to do
Turning around
That's what I'm going to do
Because you've done better by me
Than I've done by you

[Intro]

[Chorus]
Well I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are going to flood you, big river
And I'm going to sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Well I followed her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
Well I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows and she went on down alone

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And I'm going to sit right here until I die

[x3]

[Verse]
To lay me down, once more
To lay me down with my head in sparkling clover
To lay me down, one last time, to lay me down
To be with you, once more, to be with you
With our bodies close together
Let the world go by, like the clouds a'streaming
To lay me down, one last time, to lay me down
To lay me down, to lay me down, to lay me down, one last time
To lay me down
To lie with you, once more, to lie with you
With our dreams entwined together
To wake beside you, my love still sleeping
To tell sweet lies, one last time and say good night
To lay me down, to lay me down, to lay me down, one last time
To lay me down, one last time, to lay me down
To lay me down, to lay me down, to lay me down, to lay me down
To lay me down

[Verse 1]
On the day when I was born, Daddy sat down and cried
I had the mark just as plain as day which could not be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel rolling loaded dice
Ace of Spades behind his ear and him not thinking twice

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Verse 2]
If all you got to live for is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine
Lost my boots in transit, baby, pile of smoking leather
I nailed a retread to my feet and prayed for better weather

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Verse 3]
They say that when your ship comes in, the first man takes the sails
Second takes the afterdeck, the third, the planks and rails
What's the point of calling shots
This cue ain't straight in line
Cue balls made of Styrofoam and no one's got the time

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Outro]
Across the Rio Grandio, across the lazy river 

[x5]

[Verse 1]
All the years combine
They melt into a dream
A broken angel sings
From a guitar
In the end there's just a song
Comes crying like the wind
Through all the broken dreams
And vanished years

[Chorus]
Stella blue, Stella blue

[Verse 2]
When all the cards are down
There's nothing left to see
There's just the pavement left
And broken dreams
In the end there's still that song
Comes crying like the wind
Down every lonely street
That's ever been

[Chorus]
Stella blue, Stella blue

[Verse 3]
I've stayed in every blue-light cheap hotel
Can't win for trying
Dust off those rusty strings just
One more time
Going to make 'em shine (shine)

It all rolls into one
And nothing comes for free
There's nothing you can hold
For very long
And when you hear that song
Come crying like the wind
It seems like all this life
Was just a dream

[Chorus]
Stella blue, Stella blue

[Chorus]
Well the joint was jumping, going around and around
Hey! reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
Well they never stopped rocking till the moon went down

[Verse 1]
Well it sounds so sweet I had to take me a chance
I rose out of my seat Lord, I had to dance
Started moving my feet, well a clapping my hands

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Well at twelve o'clock Lord, the place was packed
The front doors was locked Lord, the place was packed
When the police knocked, those doors they flew back

[Chorus]

[repeat until fade]

[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk
Virginia, California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound
It rode me past Raleigh, and on across Caroline
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling across the Georgia state
Had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Half way across Alabama
The Hound broke down
Left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham

[Verse 2]
Straight off bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
People are there who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Sure as she bore me, she bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We'd be heading in the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines, cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia
Tidewater four ten oh nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line

[Verse 1]
Way down in the south of France all the ladies love to dance
Kick their heels up in the air snap their fingers for romance
While the gentlemen compare blonde or black or auburn hair
Check the motion and the style Oh, you know they take their while
Hey, to make the motion more complete, yeah, to make it more a treat
Club D'Jour is where to go come on down and see the show

[Chorus]
When the rhythm's really right you can burn it down tonight
When the singing's really fine sweet as Spanish sherry wine

[Verse 2]
When the club can't contain the beat it just rolls out in the street
Spills on down the avenue bringing dancers to their feet
When it's good as it can be it gets better wait and see
Oh, these folks don't ever sleep until they're passed out in the street
Way down in the south of France all the ladies love to dance
Clap their hands and walk on air, yeah, the feeling's really there
Won't you take a little taste raise it to your charming face?

[Chorus]
When the rhythm's really right you can burn it down tonight
When the singing's really fine sweet as Spanish sherry wine
Go on take a chance, the ladies do love to dance

[Verse 1]
I feel tears welling up from down deep inside
Like my heart's got a big break
And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful that i may never shake
You might think that i'm taking it hard since you broke me off with a call
You might wager that i'll hide in sorrow and i might lay right down and bawl

[Chorus]
Now the race is on and here comes pride up the back stretch
Heartaches a going to the inside, my tears are holding back, trying not to fall
My heart's our of the running, true love scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches, and the winner loses all

[Verse 2]
One day i ventured in love never once suspecting
What the final result would be
Now i live in fear of waking up each morning
And finding that you're gone from me
There's an aching pain in my heart for the name of the one that i hated to face
Someone else came out to win her, and i came out in second place

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
You tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
The sunny side of the street is dark
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
Maybe that's because it's midnight
In the dark of the moon besides

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe the dark is from your eyes
(Maybe the dark is from your eyes) 

[x3]
You know you got such dark eyes!

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just got to poke around

[Verse 2]
You think you've seen this town clear through
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
Nothing here that could interest you
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
It's not because you missed out
On the thing that we had to start

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Maybe you had too much too fast
(Maybe you had too much too fast) 

[x3]
Or just over played your part

[Chorus]
Nothing shaking on Shakedown Street
Used to be the heart of town
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
You just got to poke around

[Verse 3]
Since I'm passing your way today
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
I just stopped in because I want to say
(Well, well, well, you can never tell)
I recall your darkness
When it crackled like a thundercloud

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart) 

[x3]
When I can hear it beat out loud!

[Repeat Chorus until fade]

[Verse 1]
I need a woman about twice my age
A lady of nobility, gentility and rage
Splendor in the dark, lightning on the draw
We'll go right through the book and break each and every law

[Chorus]
I got a feeling and it won't go away, oh no
Just one thing then I'll be okay
I need a miracle every day

[Verse 2]
I need a woman about twice my height
Statuesque, raven-dressed, a goddess of the night
Her secret incantations, a candle burning blue
We'll consult the spirits maybe they'll know what to do

[Chorus]
And it's real and it won't go away, oh no
I can't get around and I can't run away
I need a miracle every day

[Verse 3]
I need a woman about twice my weight
A ton of fun who packs a gun with all her freight
Find her in a sideshow leave her in LA
Ride her like a surfer riding on a tidal wave

[Chorus]
And it's real, believe what I say, yeah
Just one thing I got to say
I need a miracle every day
It takes dynamite to get me up
Too much of everything is just enough
One more thing I just got to say
I need a miracle every day 

[x3]
(got to be the only way)
I need a miracle 

[x3]
Everyday

[Fade]

[Verse 1]
Voices slide down off the mountain, sunlight turning red
Falls on the earth and it spreads
Even the families lower their heads as they ride
Age old faces of the mountains looming naturally
I wonder if they're looking at me, their monumental eyes I can feel

[Chorus]
In the glow of the twilight the thought of home
Reminds me now I'm reaching out to you
Anything I can do to be safe and warm in your arms
All I have from the heart of you

[Verse 2]
I'd meet you anywhere in the country or anywhere on the sea
All over the world it could be I would follow you with the heart of me
Remembering you hold me tight in tomorrow morning's light I will find you

[Chorus]
When I awoke the stars were out and shining, shining for you and me
All I ever want to be is save and warm in your arms
All I have, from the heart of me

[Verse]
1948, Christmas eve, with a full moon over town
Stagger Lee shot Billy DeLions
And he blew that poor boy down
Do you know what he shot him for?
What do you make of that?
Because Billy DeLions threw the lucky dice
Won Stagger Lee's Stetson hat
Bayo, Bayo, tell me how can this be?
You arrest the girls for turning tricks
But you're scared of Stagger Lee
Stagger Lee is a madman and he shot my Billy D
Bayo go get him or give the job to me
Delia DeLions, dear sweet Delia-D
How the hell can I arrest him? He's twice as big as me
Well don't ask me to go downtown, I won't come back alive 

[no more]
Not only is that mother big but he packs a .45 

[four]
Bayo, Delia said, just give me a gun
He shot my Billy dead now I'm going to see him hung
She went into the DeLion's club through Billy DeLions blood
Stepped up to Stagger Lee at the bar
Said, "Buy me a gin fizz, love."
As Stagger Lee lit a cigarette she shot him in the balls
Blew the smoke off her revolver, had him dragged to city hall
Bayo, Bayo, see you hang him high
He shot my Billy dead and now he's got to die
Delia went a walking down on Singapore Street
A three-piece band on the corner played "Near My God to Thee"
But Delia whistled a different tune, what tune could it be?
The song that woman sung was "Look Out Stagger Lee"
The song that Delia sung was "Look Out Stagger Lee"

[Verse 1]
Well hop in the hack
Turn on the key
Pop in the clutch
Let the wheels roll free

[Chorus]
Come on honey, let me sing them away
Come on honey, let me sing them away
Oh, honey, let me sing your blues away

[Verse 2]
Give me a little of that old time love
Cause i ain't never had near enough
Honey, walk that walk with style and grace
This ain't no knock-down drag-out race
It don't matter much, pick any gear
Brind you a pound and drop the rear
Baby, baby what can i say
I'm here to drive those blues away
I sent a letter to a man i know
Said, "one for the money and two for the show."
I wait all summer for his reply
Said, "three to get ready and four to fly."
Only two things in the world i love
That's rock 'n' roll and my turtle dove
When i was a young man i needed good luck
But i'm a little bit older now and i know my stuff

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Julie catch a rabbit by his hair
Come back stepping, like to walk on air
Get back home where you belong
And don't you run off no more

Don't hang your head, let the two time roll
Grass shack nailed to a pine wood floor
Ask the time, baby, I don't know
Come back later, gonna let it show

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there?
I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row, row, row
Row row

[Verse 2]
Here's a half dollar if you dare
Double twist when you hit the air
Look at Julie, down below
The levee doing the do-pas-o

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there, I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Verse 3]
Broken heart don't feel so bad
You ain't got half of what you thought you had
Rock you, baby, to and fro
Not too fast, and not too slow

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there, I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Bridge]
That's the way it's been in town
Ever since they tore the jukebox down
Two-bit piece don't buy no more
Not so much as it done before

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there, I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Verse 1]
Wake of the flood, laughing water, forty-nine
Get out the pans, don't just stand there dreaming
Get out the way, get out the way

[Chorus]
Here comes sunshine
Here comes sunshine

[Verse 2]
Line up a long shot
Maybe try it two times, maybe more
Good to know you got shoes to wear when you find the floor
Why hold out for more?

[Chorus]
Here comes sunshine
Here comes sunshine

[Verse 3]
Asking you nice, now
Keep the mother rolling one more time
Been down before but you just don't have to go no more, no more

[Chorus]
Here comes sunshine
Here comes sunshine

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nuthatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Verse 2]
There comes a redeemer
And he slowly too fades away
There follows a wagon behind him
That's loaded with clay
And the seeds that were silent
All burst into bloom and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
And sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Verse 1]
If I had the world to give
I'd give it to you long as you live
Would you let it fall or hold it all in your arms?
If I had a song to sing
I'd sing it to you as long as you live
Lullaby or maybe a plain serenade
Wouldn't you laugh, dance, and cry
Or be afraid at the change you made

[Chorus]
I may not have the world to give to you
But maybe I have a tune or two
Only if you let me be your world
Could I ever give this world to you
Could I ever give this world to you

[Bridge]
But I will give what love I have to give
I will give what love I have to give
I will give what love I have to give
Long as I live

[Verse 2]
If I had a star to give
I'd give it to you long as you live
Would you have the time to watch it shine, watch it shine
Or ask for the moon and heaven too?
I'd give it to you

[Chorus]
Well maybe I've got no star to spare
Or anything fine or even rare
Only if you let me be your world
Could I ever give this world to you
Could I ever give this world to you

[Verse 1]
Must be getting early
Clocks are running late
Paint by number morning sky looks so phony
Dawn is breaking everywhere
Light a candle, curse the glare
Draw the curtains, I don't care 'cause it's alright

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Verse 2]
I see you've got your fist out
Say your piece and get out
Yes, I get the gist of it, but it's alright
Sorry that you feel that way
The only thing there is to say
Every silver lining's got a touch of grey

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Bridge]
It's a lesson to me
The Ables and the Bakers and the C's
The ABC's we all must face
Try to keep a little grace

It's a lesson to me
The Deltas and the East and the Freeze
The ABCs we all think of
To try to win a little love

[Verse 3]
I know the rent is in arrears
The dog has not been fed in years
It's even worse than it appears, but it's alright
Cow is given kerosene
Kid can't read at seventeen
The words he knows are all obscene, but it's alright

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Verse 4]
The shoe is on the hand it fits
There's really nothing much to it
Whistle through your teeth and spit 'cause it's alright
Oh, well, a touch of grey, kind of suits you anyway
That's was all I had to say, but it's alright

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Chorus 2]
We will get by
We will get by
We will get by
We will survive

[Verse 1]
You say you want to try again, wear it down between the lines
Well, I have a better end in mind

[Chorus]
It doesn't seem you really have to
Close your eyes to see though I know you don't mean to be
You are so far from me

[Verse 2]
There was something I had caught inside screaming hard to make it go
And tied me down low

[Chorus]
It doesn't seem you really have to
Close your eyes to see, you've been all you'll be to me
Though I know you don't mean to be, it's just too late
And we can't relate at all

[Bridge]
It doesn't seem you really have to
Close your eyes to see though I know you don't mean to be
You are so far from me

[Outro]
This is the last time I want to say so long
This song is my last song for you
There's just nothing here to hold on to
Baby, nothing to hold on to

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Undefeated

[Verse 1]
Wish I knew then what I know now, but, I, I
Can’t change the past no matter how I try, I
So I’ma get up and dance, you know
Cause this might be my last chance (whoa)
Like there’s nobody around
Even gravity can’t keep me down

[Chorus]
Everybody get it started
I’m on top of the world, what a feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I’m undefeated, undefeated (yeah)
No one told me what I could be
Now I’m walking on air, what a feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I’m undefeated, undefeated, tonight
Undefeated

[Verse 2]
No looking back can’t live that way, right now, ow
Yesterday’s gone, I’ve found my way somehow, ow
So I’ma get up and dance, you know
Cause this might be my last chance (whoa)
Like there’s nobody around
Even gravity can’t keep me down

[Chorus]
Everybody get it started
I’m on top of the world, what a feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I’m undefeated, undefeated (yeah)
No one told me what I could be
Now I’m walking on air, what a feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I’m undefeated, undefeated, tonight

[Bridge]
So I’ll live today like it’s my last one
There’s no time for fear, you only live once

[Chorus]
Everybody get it started
I’m on top of the world, what a feeling
Everybody say
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Please believe it, I’m undefeated
No one told me what I could be
Now I’m walking on air, what a feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I’m undefeated, undefeated, tonight

[Outro]
What a feeling (yeah)
To be undefeated
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Undefeated, tonight
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh, whoa oh oh
Undefeated

[Verse 1]
Been all around this whole round world
Lord, I just got back to day
Worked all the way honey and I gave it all to you
Honey-babe, what more can I do?

[Chorus]
Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Oh babe, it ain't no lie
You know this life I'm living is mighty high

[Verse 2]
One more woman, lord in this town
Keep her telling her lies on me
Wish to my soul that old woman would die
Keep her telling her lies on me

[Chorus]
Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Oh babe, it ain't no lie
You know this life I'm living is mighty high

[Verse 1]
Well I was drinkin' last night with a biker
And I showed him a picture of you
I said, "Pal, get to know her. You'll like her"
Seemed like the least I could do...

'Cause when he's driving his chopper
Up and down your carpeted halls
You will think me by contrast quite proper
Never mind how I stumble and fall
Never mind how I stumble and fall

[Chorus]
You imagine me sipping champagne from
Your boot
For a taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
But at least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride

[Verse 2]
Now miss sweet little soft-core pretender
Somehow baby got hard as it gets
With her black leather chrome-spiked
Suspenders
Her chain and her whip and her pets

Well we know you're the reincarnation
Of the ravenous Catherine the Great
And we know how you love your ovations
For the Z-rated scenes you create
The Z-rated scenes you create

[Chorus]
You imagine me sipping champagne from
Your boot
For a taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
But at least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride

[Bridge]
You analyze me, pretend to despise me
You laugh when I stumble and fall
There may come a day I will dance on your grave
Unable to dance, I will crawl across it
Unable to dance, I'll still crawl
Unable to dance I'll crawl

[Verse 3]
You must really consider the circus
'Cause it just might be your kind of zoo
I can't think of a place that's more perfect
For a person as perfect as you

And it's not like I'm leaving you lonely
'Cause I wouldn't know where to begin
But I know that you'll think of me only
When the snakes come marching in
When the snakes come marching in

[Chorus]
You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
For taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride
Ride, ride, ride 

[x3]
At least I'll enjoy the ride 

[x3]

[Verse 1]
Shaking in the forest, what have you to fear?
Here there may be tigers, to punch you in the ear
With gloves of stainless steel, bats carved out of bricks
Knock you down and beat you up and give your ass a kick
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love
Shaking in the desert, now wherefore do you cry?
Here there may be rattlesnakes, to punch you in the eye
With Shotgun's full of silver and bullet's made of glass
String barbed wire at your feet, that will not let you pass
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love

[Chorus]
When push comes to shove, when push comes to shove
You're afraid of love, when push comes to shove

[Verse 2]
Shaking in the bedroom, covers on your head
Are you still in fear of the hand beneath the bed?
Grabbing at the handle, scratching at the door
Maybe it's mystery killer you saw on channel four
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love
Shaking in the garden, the fear within you grows
Here there may be roses, to punch you in the nose
Put my arms around you, love you until you cry
Wrap you in your sweet perfume and squeeze you until you die
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
I told Althea I was feeling lost
Lacking in some direction
Althea told me upon scrutiny
That my back might need protection
I told Althea that treachery
Was tearing me limb from limb
Althea told me: "Now cool down boy
Settle back, easy Jim"

[Verse 1]
You may be Saturday's child all grown
Moving with a pinch of grace
You may be a clown in the burying ground
Or just another pretty face
You may be the fate of Ophelia
Sleeping and perchance to dream
Honest to the point of recklessness
Self centered to the extreme

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Ain't nobody messing with you but you
Your friends are getting most concerned
Loose with the truth
Maybe it's your fire
But baby, don't get burned
When the smoke has cleared, she said
That's what she said to me
You're going to want a bed to lay your head
And a little sympathy

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Bridge]
There are things you can replace
And others you cannot
The time has come to weigh those things
This space is getting hot
You know this space is getting hot

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
I told Althea
I'm a roving sign
That I was born to be a bachelor
Althea told me: "Okay, that's fine"
So now I'm out trying to catch her

[Outro]
Can't talk to you without talking to me
We're guilty of the same old thing
Talking a lot about less and less
And forgetting the love we bring

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
I'm looking for a chateau, 21 rooms but one will do 

[x2]
I don't want to buy it
I just want to rent it for a dollar or two
I met an old mistake walking down the street today 

[x2]
I didn't want to be mean about it
I didn't have one good thing to say

[Chorus]
West L.A. fadeaway, West L.A. fadeaway
Little red light on the highway, big green light on the speedway

[Verse 2]
I had a steady job holding items for the mob 

[x2]
Know the pay's pathetic
It's a shame those boys couldn't be more copacetic

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I need a West L.A. girl, already know what I need to know 

[x2]
Lord, just how far to go
West L.A. fadeaway, here's one chance you say
She tries to live by the Golden Rule
Said you treat other people right
Other people probably treat you cool

[Verse 1]
I know these rails we're on like I know my
Lady's smile
Re-see a dozen dreams in every passing mile
Can't begin to count the trips
That she and I have made
But I wish I had a dollar
For each time we've both been down this grade

[Chorus]
Nine hundred thousand tons of steel
Made to roll
Her brakes don't work and this grade's so steep
Her engine's sure to blow
Nine hundred thousand tons of steel
Out of control
She's more a roller coaster than the train I used
To know

[Verse 2]
It's one hell of an understatement to say she
Can get mean
She's temperamental, more a bitch than a machine
She wasn't built to travel at
The speed a rumor flies
These wheels are bound to jump the tracks
Before they burn the ties

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Murphy's sure outdone himself to pick this
Stretch of track
I can only hope my luck is riding in the back
Well I have prayed to God
This ain't the day we meet
I've done about everything
But try dragging my feet

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oo, oo, I wanna go down slow
Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo
Nine hundred thousand tons of steel
Out of control
She's more a roller coaster than the train I used
To know

[Intro]
Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free
Dizzy with eternity
Paint it with a skin of sky
Brush in some clouds and sea
Call it home for you and me
A peaceful place or so it looks from space
A closer look reveals the human race
Full of hope, full of grace
Is the human face
But afraid we may lay our home to waste

[Verse 1]
There's a fear down here we can't forget
Hasn't got a name just yet
Always awake, always around
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Verse 2]
Now watch as the ball revolves
And the nighttime falls
Again the hunt begins
Again the bloodwind calls
By and by, the morning sun will rise
But the darkness never goes
From some men's eyes
It strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets
Staking turf, dividing up meat
Nightmare spook, piece of heat
It's you and me
You and me

[Chorus]
Click flash blade in ghetto night
Rudies looking for a fight
Rat cat alley, roll them bones
Need that cash to feed that jones
And the politicians throwin' stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Bridge]
Commissars and pin-stripe bosses
Roll the dice
Any way they fall
Guess who gets to pay the price?
Money green or proletarian gray
Selling guns 'stead of food today

[Chorus]
So the kids they dance
And shake their bones
And the politicians throwin' stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Verse 3]
Heartless powers try to tell us
What to think
If the spirit's sleeping
Then the flesh is ink
History's page will thus be carved in stone
And we are here, and we are on our own
On our own
On our own
On our own

[Verse 4]
If the game is lost
Then we're all the same
No one left to place or take the blame
We can leave this place and empty stone
Or that shinin' ball we used to call our home

[Chorus]
So the kids they dance
And shake their bones
And the politicians throwin' stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Bridge 2]
Shipping powders back and forth
Singing "Black goes south and white comes north"
In a whole world full of petty wars
Singing I got mine and you got yours
And the current fashion sets the pace
Lose your step, fall out of grace
And the radical, he rant and rage
Singing someone's got to turn the page
And the rich man in his summer home
Singing just leave well enough alone
But his pants are down, his cover's blown...

[Chorus]
And the politicians throwin' stones
So the kids they dance
And shake their bones
And it's all too clear we're on our own
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Outro]
Picture a bright blue ball
Just spinnin', spinnin, free
Dizzy with the possibilities
Ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Verse 1]
When the last rose of summer pricks my finger
And the hot sun chills me to the bone
When I can't hear the song for the singer
And I can't tell my pillow from a stone

[Chorus 1]
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And sing me a song of my own
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And sing me a song of my own

[Verse 2]
When the last bolt of sunshine hits the mountain
And the stars start to splatter in the sky
When the moon splits the southwest horizon
With the scream of an eagle on the fly

[Chorus 2]
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And listen to the ripples as they moan
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And sing me a song of my own

[Bridge]
Black muddy river
Roll on forever
I don't care how deep or wide
If you got another side
Roll muddy river, roll muddy river
Black muddy river roll

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Black muddy river
Roll on forever
I don't care how deep or wide
If you got another side
Roll muddy river, roll muddy river
Black muddy river roll

[Verse 3]
When it seems like the night will last forever
And there's nothing left to do but count the years
When the strings of my heart start to sever
And stones fall from my eyes instead of tears

[Outro]
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And dream me a dream of my own
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And sing me a song of my own
And sing me a song of my own

[Verse 1]
Inside you're burning
I can see clear through
Your eyes tell more than you mean
Them to
Lit up and flashing
Like the reds and blues
Out there on the neon avenue

[Chorus]
But I feel like a stranger
Feel like a stranger

[Verse 2]
Well the music's thundering
We're restless and hot
You keep firing glances across the room

And I can't stop wondering
Just what you got
Get the feeling I'm gonna find out real
Soon

[Chorus]
Still feel like a stranger
Feel like a stranger

Well you know it's gonna get stranger
So let's get on with the show

[Verse 3]
Yes and the wheel
Gets smoking 'round midnight
You shoot me a look that says "Let's go"

Yes and it feels
Just like running a red light
There ain't no point in looking behind us, no!

[Chorus]
Still I feel like a stranger
Feel like a stranger
You know it keeps getting stranger and stranger
If it's love then how would I know?
How would I know?

[Outro]
Yes and it's gonna get stranger
Some things you just know
If this were love then how would I know?
(Feel like a stranger)
(Feel like a stranger)
(Feel like a stranger)
(Feel like a stranger)
It's gonna be a long hot crazy night
It's gonna be a long long crazy crazy night
Yeah crazy night
Silky silky crazy crazy night

[Verse 1]
My brother Esau killed a hunter
Back in 1969
And before the killing was done
His inheritance was mine
But his birthright was a wand to wave
Before a weary band
Esau gave me sleeplessness
And a piece of moral land
My father favored Esau
Who was eager to obey
All the bloody wild commandments
The Old Man shot his way
But all this favor ended
When my brother failed at war
He staggered home
And found me in the door

[Chorus]
Esau skates on mirrors anymore
He meets his pale reflection at the door
Yet sometimes at night I dream
He's still that hairy man
Shadowboxing the Apocalypse
And wandering the land
Shadowboxing the Apocalypse
And wandering the land

[Verse 2]
Esau holds a blessing
Brother Esau bears a curse
I would say that the blame is mine
But I suspect it's something worse
The more my brother looks like me
The less I understand
The silent war that bloodied both our hands
Sometimes at night, I think I understand

[Chorus]
It's brother to brother and it's man to man
And it's face to face and it's hand to hand
We shadow dance the silent war within
The shadow dance, it never ends
Never ends, never ends
Shadowboxing the Apocalypse, yet again
Yet again
Shadowboxing the Apocalypse
And wandering the land

[Verse]
Carve your name
Carve your name in ice and wind
Search for where
Search for where the rivers end
Or where the rivers start
Do everything that's in you
That you feel to be your part
But never give your love, my friend
Unto a foolish heart
Leap from ledges
Leap from ledges high and wild
Learn to speak
Speak with wisdom like a child
Directly from the heart
Crown yourself the king of clowns
Or stand way back apart
But never give your love, my friend
Unto a foolish heart
Shun a friend
Shun a brother and a friend
Never look
Never look around the bend
Or check a weather chart
Sign the Mona Lisa
With a spray can, call it art
But never give your love, my friend
Unto a foolish heart
A foolish heart will call on you
To toss your dreams away
Then turn around and blame you
For the way you went astray
A foolish heart will cost you sleep
And often make you curse
A selfish heart is trouble
But a foolish heart is worse
Bite the hand
Bite the hand that bakes your bread
Dare to leap
Where the angels fear to tread
Till you are torn apart
Stoke the fires of paradise
With coals from Hell to start
But never give your love, my friend
Unto a foolish heart 

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Well, there ain't nobody safer than someone who doesn't care
And it isn't even lonely when no one's ever there
I had a lot of dreams once, but some of them came true
The honey's sometimes bitter when fortune falls on you

[Chorus]
So you know I've been a soldier in the armies of the night
And I'll find the fatal error in what's otherwise alright
But here you're trembling like a sparrow, I will try with all my might
To give you just a little sweetness
Just a little sweetness
Just a little light

[Verse 2]
I have always heard that virtue ought to be its own reward
But it never comes so easy when you're living by the sword
It's even harder to be heartless when you look at me that way
You're as mighty as the flower that will grow the stones away
Even though I been a stranger, full of irony and spite
Holding little but contempt for all things beautiful and bright
Something shines around you and it seems, to my delight
To give me just a little sweetness
Just a little sweetness 

[x2]
Just a little light

[Bridge]
This could be just another highway, coiled up in the night
You could be just another white-tail, baby, stranded on my brights
There's a tingling recognition
Like the sound of distant thunder
And I begin to wonder
If the love I've driven under
Won't ignite

[Chorus]
So you know I've been a soldier in the armies of the night
And I'll find the fatal error in what's otherwise alright
Something shines around you that seems, to my delight
To give me just a little sweetness
Just a little sweetness 

[x2]
Just a little light

[Verse 1]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until your deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down

[Verse 2]
I been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you all that went down
It would burn off both your ears

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until your deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me
And tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sitting there
Composing lonesome blues

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show that you don't ever know
Watch each card you play and
Play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until your deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down

[Outro]
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down

[Verse 1]
Thirty two teeth in a jawbone
Alabama's tryin' for none
Before I have to hit him, I hope he's got the sense to run
Reason the poor girls love him
Promise them everything
Why they all believe him? He wears a big diamond ring
Run, run!

[Chorus]
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me, just get down and leave and walk away

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Verse 2]
Major Domo Billy Bojangles
Sat down and had a drink with me
Said "What about Alabama that keeps a-coming back to me?"
I heard your plea in the courthouse
Witness box began to rock and rise
Forty-nine sister states had Alabama in their eyes
Run, run!

[Chorus]
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me, just get down and leave and walk away

[Guitar Solo 2]

[Verse 3]
Major said, "Why don't we give him rope enough to hang himself?
No need to worry the jury
They'll probably take care of themselves"
Twenty-third Psalm, Major Domo
Reserve me a table for three
Down in the Valley of the Shadow, just you, Alabama and me
Run, run!

[Chorus]
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me, just get down and leave and walk away
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me, just get down and leave and walk away
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me, just get down and leave and walk away
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me, just get down and leave and walk away
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
(fade)

[Verse]
Dear Mr. Fantasy play us a tune
Something to make us all feel happy
Do anything to take (keep) us out of this gloom
Sing a song, play guitar, make us happy
You are the one who makes us feel glad
Please don't be sad to take up the straight life you had
We wouldn't have known you all these years
Dear Mr. Fantasy play us a tune
Something to treat us happy
Do anything to take (keep) us out of this gloom
Sing a song, play guitar, make us happy
Patience runs out on the junkie
The dark side hires another soul
Did he steal his fate or earn it?
Was he force fed, did he learn it?
Whatever happened to his precious self control?

Like him, I'm tired of tryin' to heal
This tomcat heart with which I'm blessed
Is destruction loving's twin?
Must I chose to lose or win?
Maybe when my turn comes I will have guessed

These are the horns of the dilemma
What truth this proof against all lies?
When sacred fails before profane
The wisest man is deemed insane
Even the purest of romantics compromise

What fixation feeds this fever?
As the full moon pales and climbs
Am I living truth or rank deceiver?
Am I the victim or the crime?
Am I the victim or the crime?
Am I the victim or the crime, or the crime?
And so I wrestle with the angel
To see who'll reap the seeds I sow
Am I the driver or the driven?
Will I be damned to be forgiven?
Is there anybody here but me who needs to know?

What it is that feeds this fever
As the full moon pales and climbs?
Am I living truth or rank deceiver?
Am I the victim or the crime?
Am I the victim or the crime?
Am I the victim or the crime?
Am I the victim or the crime?
Am I the victim or the crime, or the crime?

[Verse]
Moses come riding up on a quasar
His spurs were jingling, the door was ajar
His buckle was silver, his manner was bold
And I asked him to come in out of the cold
His brain was boiling, his reason was spent
His motto is nothing is borrowed, nothing is lent
He ask me for mercy, I gave him a gun
He said these things just got to be done

[Chorus]
Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence
You'd get right to work if you had any sense
You know the one thing we need is a left-hand monkey wrench

[Verse]
Gideon come up with his eyes on the floor
Said "You ain't got a hinge, you can't close the door."
Moses stood up above his six foot and ten
Said "You can't close the door when the wall's caved in."
Ask him for water, he poured me some wine
We finished the bottle and broke into mine
You get what you come for, ya ready to go
Well, it's one in ten thousand that come for the show

[Chorus]
Abraham and Isaac diggin' on a well
Mama came quick with the water witch spell
Well cool clear water well you can't ever tell

[Chorus]
Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence
You'd get right to work if you had any sense
You know the one thing we need is a left-hand monkey wrench

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease, don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Verse 1]
I was standing on the corner, talking to Miss Brown
When I turned around, sweet mama, she was way across town
So I'm walking down the street, with a dollar in my hand
I've been looking for a woman, sweet mama, ain't got no man

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
The girl I love, she's sweet and true
You know the dress she wears, sweet mama, it's pink and blue
She brings me coffee, you know she brings me tea
She brings about every damn thing, but the jailhouse key

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Verse 1: Bob Weir]
Laid back in an old saloon, with a peso in my hand
Watching flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls who giggle when I smile
There's a little boy who wants to shine my feet
And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from paying dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl who's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali blues
Yeah

[Chorus: All]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose?
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 2: Bob Weir]
She said her name was Billy Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace made of gold
All the French perfume you'd care to smell
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
"Go on, my friend, do anything you choose."
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues

[Chorus: All]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose?
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
And then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billy Jean was waiting when he came
She told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun
I'd have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, Lord, he didn't even draw
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues
Yeah

[Chorus: All]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose?
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 1]
Good, good morning, so good to see you weren't just a dream of mine
Real as a raven, real as thunder, real as the sun shining
But still so very undefined
Can't imagine what's behind those sleepy eyes
Little stranger, don't try to hide now
You look so young when you're afraid
There is no danger, but from the devil
He may want you, but I'm in his way

[Chorus]
You don't know how easy it is
You don't know how easy it is to love you

[Verse 2]
And come the moonrise when the dew falls
Don't be the sun that fades away
Don't leave me darkness, she's no lover, she hides the day

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Verse 1]
Compass card is spinning
Helm is swingin' to and fro
Ooh, where's the dog star?
Ooh, where's the moon?

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been too long at sea

[Verse 2]
Some days the gales are howling
Some days the sea is still as glass
Ooh, reef the main sail
Ooh, lash the mast

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been too long at sea
Now the shore lights beckon
Yeah there's a price for being free

[Verse 3]
Yeah the sea birds cry
There's a ghost wind blowin'
It's calling you, to that misty swirling sea
Till the chains of your dreams are broken
No place in this world you can be

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been way too long at sea
Now the shore lights beckon
Yeah there's a price for being free

Drifting yeah drifting
Yeah drifting and dreaming

[Verse 4]
'Cause there's a place you've never been
Maybe a place you've never seen
You can hear her calling on the wind
Go on and drift your life away
Yeah just drifting and dreaming
Maybe drift your life away
Drifting and dreaming

[Outro]
Yes I'm going on a dream
Maybe going on a dream
Maybe going on a dream
Maybe going on a dream
Maybe going on a dream

[Verse 1]
This must be heaven
Tonight I crossed the line
You must be the angel
I thought I might never find
Was it you I heard singin'
Oh while I was chasin' dreams?
Driven by the wind
Like the dust that blows around

[Chorus]
And the rain fallin' down
But I never know
(Sure don't know)
Never know
Never know
(Sure don’t know)

[Verse 2]
This must be  heaven
'Cause here's where the rainbow ends
At last it's the real thing
Or close enough to pretend
When that wind blows
When the night's about to fall
I can hear the sirens call
It's a certain sort of sound

[Chorus]
In the rain fallin' down
Rain fallin' down
Rain fallin' down
Rain fallin' down
Rain fallin' down

[Verse  3]
Holes in what's left of my reason
Holes in the knees of my blues
Odds against me been increasin'
But I'll pull through

Never could read no road map
And I don't know what the weather might do
But hear that witch wind whinin'
See that dog star shinin'
I've got a feelin' there's no time to lose
No time to lose!

Maybe goin' on a feelin' maybe goin' on
A dream

Well I never know
(Sure don't know)
Never know
Never know
(Sure don't know)

[Verse 4]
Well it's been heaven
But even rainbows end
Now my sails are fillin'
And the wind's so willin'
That I'm as good as gone again
I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance
Just a Saint of Circumstance
Just a tiger in a trance
In the rain fallin' down

[Bridge]
Rain falling down
Rain falling down
Rain falling down
Rain falling down

[Outro]
Well I never know, just don't know (just don't know)
Sure don't know what I'm going for (sure don't know)
But I'm going to go for it for sure, yeah for sure, yeah for sure
Sure don't know what I'm going for, just don't never know, never never know
But I'm going to go for it for sure, No no no, that's for sure, yeah for sure
Sure don't know what I'm going for, Just don't never never know, no no
But I'm going to go for it for sure, that's for sure
Sure don't know what I'm going for, Yeah maybe going on a dream, going on a dream now
But I'm going to go for it for sure, Maybe going on a feeling, maybe going on a feeling, Maybe going on a feeling

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time there was an engineer
Drove a locomotive both far and near
Accompanied by a monkey that would sit on a stool
Watching everything the engineer would do
One day the engineer wanted a bite to eat
He left the monkey sitting on the driver's seat
The monkey pulled the throttle, the locomotive jumped the gun
And did 80 miles an hour down the mainline run

[Chorus]
Big locomotive right on time, big locomotive coming down the line
Big locomotive no. 99, left the engineer with a worried mind

[Verse 2]
The engineer called up the dispatcher on the phone
To tell him all about his locomotive was gone
Dispatcher got on the wire, switch operator to the right
Cause the monkey's got the main line sewed up tight
The switch operator got the message on time
Said there's a northbound livin' on the same main line
Open up the switch i'm gonna let him through the hole
Cause the monkey's got the locomotive under control

[Chorus]
There was a wealthy merchant
In London he did dwell
He had a beautiful daughter
The truth to you we'll tell
Oh, the truth to you we'll tell

She had sweethearts a-plenty
And men of high degree
But none but Jack the sailor
Her true love ever be
Oh, her true love ever be

Jackie's gone a-sailing
With trouble on his mind
He's left his native country
And his darling girl behind
Oh, his darling girl behind

She went down to a tailor shop
And dressed in man's array
She climbed on board a vessel
To convey herself away
Oh, convey herself away
Before you get on board, sir
Your name we'd like to know
She smiled on her countenance
They called me Jack-a-Roe
Oh, they called me Jack-a-Roe

I see your waist is slender
Your fingers they are small
Your cheeks too red and rosy
To face the cannonball
Oh, to face the cannonball

I know my waist's too slender
My fingers they are small
But it would not make me tremble
To see ten thousand fall
Oh, to see ten thousand fall

The war soon being over
She went and looked around
Among the dead and wounded
Her darling boy she found
Oh, her darling boy she found

She picked him up on in her arms
And carried him to the town
She sent for a physician
To quickly heal his wounds
Oh, to quickly heal his wounds
This couple they got married
So well, they did agree
This couple they got married
So why not you and me?
Oh, why not you and me?
Oh, why not you and me?

[Verse 1]
If you go down to Deep Elem put your money in your shoes
The women in Deep Elem they give you the deep elem blues
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues

[Verse 2]
Once I knew a preacher, preached the Bible through-and-through
Went down to Deep Elem, now his preachin' days are through
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
When you go down to Deep Elem put your money in your socks
Getting to Deep Elem will put you on the rocks
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues

[Verse 4]
When you go down to Deep Elem to have a little fun
Have your fifteen dollars when the police man come
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
If you go down to Deep Elem put your money in your shoes
The women in Deep Elem got them Deep Elem blues
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues
Oh, sweet mama, your daddy's got them Deep Elem blues

[Verse 1]
I have seen where the wolf has slept by the
Silver stream
I can tell by the mark he left you were in his
Dream
Ah, child of countless trees
Ah, child of boundless seas
What you are, what you're meant to be
Speaks his name, though you were born to me
Born to me
Cassidy...

[Verse 2]
Lost now on the country miles in his cadillac
I can tell by the way you smile he's rolling back
Come wash the nighttime clean
Come grow this scorched ground green
Blow the horn, tap the tambourine
Close the gap of the dark years in between
You and me
Cassidy...

[Verse 3]
Quick beats in an icy heart
Catch-colt draws a coffin cart
There he goes now, here she starts:
Hear her cry
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Verse 4]
Fare thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine
(repeat verse)

Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Verse 1]
Why I married me a bad girl, tell you the reason why
Bad girls will even do things on the sly
Look for your dinner to be good and hot
She never even put a stew bone in the pot

[Chorus]
She's on the road again, sure as you're born
Natural born easy on the road again
She's on the road again, sure as you're born

[Verse 2]
Friend come by, say looking for his hat
Wants to know where your husband's at
I don't know, he's on his way to the pen
Come on pretty mama, let's get on the road again

[Chorus]
She's on the road again, sure as you're born
Natural born easy on the road again
She's on the road again, sure as you're born

[Verse 3]
Went to my house my front door was locked
Went 'round to my window, but my window was locked
Jumped right back, shook my head
Big old rounder in my folding bed
Jumped into the window, broke the glass
Never seen that little rounder run so fast

[Chorus]
She's on the road again, sure as you're born
Natural born easy on the road again
She's on the road again, sure as you're born
She's on the road again, sure as you're born
Natural born easy on the road again
She's on the road again, sure as you're born

[Verse 1]
Standing on the moon
I got no cobweb on my shoe
Standing on the moon
I'm feeling so alone and blue
I see the Gulf of Mexico
As tiny as a tear
The coast of California
Must be somewhere over here, over here

[Chorus]
Standing on the moon
I see the battle rage below
Standing on the moon
I see the soldiers come and go
There's a metal flag beside me
Someone planted long ago
Old Glory standing stiffly
Crimson, white and indigo
Old Glory standing stiffly
Crimson, white and indigo
Indigo

[Verse 2]
I see all of Southeast Asia
I can see El Salvador
I hear the cries of children
And the other songs of war
It's like a mighty melody
That rings down from the sky
Standing here upon the moon
I watch it all roll by, all roll by
All roll by, all roll by

[Chorus]
Standing on the moon
I see a shadow on the sun
Standing on the moon
The stars go fading one by one
I hear a cry of victory
And another of defeat
A scrap of age-old lullaby
Down some forgotten street
Standing on the moon
Where talk is cheap and vision true
Standing on the moon
But I would rather be with you
Somewhere in San Francisco
On a back porch in July
Just looking up at heaven
At this crescent in the sky, in the sky
Standing on the moon
With nothing left to do
A lovely view of heaven
But I'd rather be with you
A lovely view of heaven
But I'd rather be with you, be with you

[Outro]
Be with you, I'd rather be with you
Be with you, I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you, be with you
Be with you, be with you

[Verse 1]
A man and a woman come together as strangers
When they part they're usually strangers still
It's like a practical joke played on us by our maker
Empty bottles that can't be filled

[Chorus]
Baby, who's to say it should have been different now that it's done
Baby, who's to say that it should have been, anyway
Baby, who's to say that it even matters in the long run
Give it just a minute
And it will blow away
It'll blow away

[Verse 2]
You fancy me to be the master of your feelings
You barely bruise me with your looks to kill
Though I admit we were sometimes brutal in our dealings
I never held you against your will

[Chorus]
Baby, who's to say it should have been different now that it's done
Baby, who's to say that it should have been, anyway
Baby, who's to say that it even matters in the long run
Give it just a minute
And it will blow away
It'll blow away

[Verse 3]
Your case against me is so very clearly stated
I plead no contest, I just turn and shrug
I've come to figure all importance overestimated
You must mean water when you beg for blood

[Chorus]
Baby, who's to say it should have been different now that it's done
Baby, who's to say that it should have been, anyway
Baby, who's to say that it even matters in the long run
Give it just a minute
And it will blow away
It'll blow away

[Outro]
Like a feather in a whirlwind
Blow away
Just as sure as the world spins
Blow away

[Verse 1]
South of Market in the land of ruin
You get all manner of action
Tinsel tigers in The Metal Room
Stalking satisfaction
They got them packaged up for love and money
Tattooed tots and chrome spike bunnies
Check my conscience at the DMZ
And roll on in, going to roll in it, honey
But I get a feeling like when big things collide
Like the crack before the thunder, like I really ought to hide
And here comes Metal Angel, she looks ready to ride
And what's that she's trying to show me?
What's that you're trying to show me?

[Chorus]
Picasso Moon, shattered light
Diamond bullets ripping up the night
Picasso Moon, liberate me
From the middle of eternity
Something hooks her little finger at me
And it's bigger than a drive-in movie, ooooo-eeee
Bigger than a drive-in movie, ooooo-eeee

[Verse 2]
Hanging ten out on space and time
Redefining distance
The next skull on your necklace is mine
Cheap for such assistance
I had a job trading bits for pieces
We'd make wrinkles, advertise them as creases
Please, find my resignation enclosed
Roll with it, roll with it, we going to roll in it, honey
Dark Angel, What's bothering you?
So strange, you'll do me all that you do
Dark Angel, you're making me blue
I guess it doesn't matter 

[x2]

[Chorus]
Picasso Moon, blinding ball
Spinning fire, the lightning calls
Picasso Moon, fall into the sky
Raring out, I'm going to testify
And stare a shout into that burning eye
Bigger than a drive-in movie, oh my 

[x2]

[Verse 3]
Strikes morning; the atomic dawn
Scramble back to cover
Quick, pop your mirrored sunglasses on
My little leather-winged lover
I see your face printed on my money
Your blazing ways really move me, honey
Heart of darkness, Yea-e-yea-e-e-hoo
Why'm I laughing? This ain't funny
Dark Angel, now just don't start
You'll break my spirit, wreck my heart
You must have a license for practicing that art
I don't presume to imagine 

[2]

[Chorus]
Picasso Moon, fractal flame
Blazing lace filling every frame
Picasso Moon, wheels within wheels
What's true when everything's real?
It's all new, I'm going to scatter the seals
Bigger than a drive-in movie, for real 

[x2]
Picasso Moon

[Verse 1]
There are times that you can beckon
There are times when you must call
You can shake a ton of reckoning
But you can't shake it all
There are times when I can help you out
And times that you must fall
There are times when you must live in doubt
And I can't help at all

[Chorus]
Three blue stars rise on the hill
Say no more, now, just be still
All these trials, soon be past
Look for something built to last

[Verse 2]
Wind held by the collar
Got a cloud held by the breeze
You can walk on coals of fire
But sometimes you must freeze
There are times when you offend me
And I do the same to you
If we can't or won't forget it
Then I guess we could be through

[Chorus]
One blue star sets on the hill
Call it back, you never will
One more star sinks in the past
Show me something built to last

[Verse 3]
Built to last until time itself
Falls tumbling from the wall
Built to last until sunshine fails
And darkness moves on all
Built to last while years roll past
Like cloudscapes in the sky
Show me something built to last
Or something built to try
There are times when you get hit upon
Try hard but you cannot give
Other times you'd gladly part
With what you need to live
Don't waste the breath to save your face
When you have done your best
And even more is asked of you
Let fate decide the rest

[Chorus]
All the stars are gone but one
Morning breaks, here comes the sun
Cross the sky now, sinking fast
Show me something built to last

[Verse 1]
Little girl lost
In a forest of dreams
It's a dark old wood
And it's damp with dew
Hoot owl hoots
For a moment it seems
Something big and cold
Just got ahold of you
Just when everything gets scary
Daddy's come around for his darling again
Hold my hand with your little fingers
Daddy's loving arms going to gather you in

[Chorus]
Ain't no way the Bogeyman can get you
You can close your eyes, the world is going to let you
Your daddy's here and never will forget you
I will take you home 

[x2]
Going to carry you back home
In my arms
I will take you home

[Verse 2]
Long is the road
We must travel on down
Short are the legs
That will struggle behind
I wish I knew for sure
Just where we're bound
What we will be doing
And what we're going to find
Wherever we go, there will be birds to cheer you
Flower to color in the fields around
Wherever we go, I'll be right here near you
You can't get lost when you're always found

[Chorus]
Ain't no fog that's thick enough to hide you
Your daddy's going to be right here beside you
If your fears should start to get inside you
I will take you home 

[x2]
Going to carry you back home
In my arms
I will take you home

[Verse 1]
We don't own this place, though we act as if we did
It's a loan from the children of our children's kids
The actual owners haven't even been born yet
But we never tend the garden and rarely we pay the rent
Some of it is broken and the rest of it is bent
Put it all on plastic and I wonder where we'll be when the bills hit

[Chorus]
We can run
But we can't hide from it
Of all possible worlds
We only got one
We got to to ride on it
Whatever we've done
We'll never get far from what we leave behind
Baby, we can run, run, run, but we can't hide
Oh no, we can't hide

[Verse 2]
I'm dumping my trash in your back yard
Making certain you don't notice really isn't so hard
You're so busy with your guns and all of your excuses to use them
Well, it's oil for the rich and babies for the poor
We got everyone believing that more is more
If a reckoning comes, maybe we will know what to do then
All these complications seem to leave no choice
I heard the tongues of billions speak with just one voice
Saying, "Just leave all the rest to me
I need it worse than you, you see."
And then I heard
The sound of one child crying
Today I went walking in the amber wind
There's a hole in the sky where the light pours in
I remembered the days when I wasn't afraid of the sunshine
But now it beats down on the asphalt land
Like a hammering blow from God's left hand
What little still grows cringes in the shade like a bad vine

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Fade]

[Verse 1]
Today I walked through the door and fell down on my floor
Got all of my papers out and read them
Seems that I've been wanderin' for a little too long
Yeah, the desert can be hot if you're wasted
Took a stab in the dark and missed again, I believe
The hardest part is not seein' what I used to see
My faith grew to a top, but worry does all it can
To whisper in both my ears make-believe stories

[Chorus]
Where are my friends now?
They're not around when I need them
I cannot pretend
Yeah, I find myself against all the odds again

[Verse 2]
Well, I like to think I'm strong, and then I'm proven wrong
Grab the keys to my car and go to work again
Yeah, showed up late, got screamed in my face
Turn around, I'm punch-drunk, but I'm laughin'
Got some thoughts in my chest, they're playin' games with my head
Ten hours of sleep, I'm in my bed again
Scream up to my god, say, "I do what I can"
How am I gonna move on from this circumstance?

[Chorus]
Where are my friends now?
They're not around when I need them
I cannot pretend
Yeah, I find myself against all the odds again

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
I'm against all the odds again
Yeah, yeah
I'm against all the odds again
Yeah, yeah
I'm against all the odds again
Yeah, yeah
I'm against all the odds again

[Verse 1]
I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road, I took a fall
Oh, baby, why did you run away?

[Pre-Chorus]
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

[Chorus]
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you

[Post-Chorus]
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

[Verse 2]
I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
'Cause something strange has come over me
Now, I can't get over you
No, I just can't get over you, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest night

[Chorus]
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you

[Post-Chorus]
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, ah
Ooh, oh, oh, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah
Aha, ah, mmm, ah
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest times
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest night
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest times
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest night

[Chorus]
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you

5 years ago, we started a journey together. On June 15th, 2009 I released The Warm Up to a few who were waiting patiently for it. Full of my dreams, fears and predictions, it resonated with you right away. Over the next year I watched it grow legs and spread at an unbelievable pace all because you felt it so much. Five years later, I couldn’t be more proud of it’s impact. Thank you.

The Warm Up is a declaration of dedication to Greatness. Told from the perspective of a kid who wants more than what his city has to offer him. The crime. The stagnation. He wants more from the girls he dates. He wants out of Muhammad’s house. He refuses to let anyone tell him he can’t dream. That he won’t make it. He believes in himself. He dedicates his life to his craft, because he’s finally realized that the work that you put in today has a direct and absolute impact on the life you live tomorrow.

You heard the passion, you heard the stories, and you believed in him too. You rooted for him. And your’e still rooting. My thoughts today come from my observations over the past 5 years. I understand now that you’re rooting for him, rooting for me, because you are also rooting for yourself. You realize that this society kills dreams and encourages you to conform. To settle for the block, to join the army, to become a lawyer when you really want to paint, to get comfortable in the projects, to slave away at a 9-5 you hate because it pays decent; to become complacent with safety. The Warm Up says, “Fuck that. I will be Greater. Watch me.”

I think about all the times over the past few years that one of you has said to me, “you’re the reason I went to college,” “yo, The Warm Up got me through some hard times,” “got me through law school,” “med school,” “high school,” “The Warm Up changed my life.”

I imagine that 5 years ago we all wanted more. The Warm Up was just something that put music and words to what we were feeling. As I write this I’m on a plane from Sydney, Australia back to New York City. Music has taken me around the world now, doing shows in places I never thought I would be. I’m grateful.

I’m wondering where you are today. 5 years later. The Warm Up dropped when some of you were upperclassmen in college. I’m hoping that you’ve found a career doing some shit you love, something that makes you happy. Maybe you needed more time to figure it out. Grad School? Or maybe you’re back in your parents crib trying to regroup. Everything will be OK. Don’t stop dreaming.

Some of ya’ll were still in high school. If you went on to college, enjoy it while you got it. If you went straight to the real world, I wish you the best. I hope you found a trade you love, or a job that allows you to support yourself. Happiness is all that matters. If you ain’t happy, adjust please.

Some of you were underclassmen in college, which means you probably just entered the workforce or you’re still trying to get that entry level position. These are the toughest times. You will struggle no doubt, but it will all work out in the end.

No matter where you were 5 years ago, I hope that today you are closer to your dreams. I know that everything hasn’t gone exactly the way you planned, it hasn’t for me either. But our job isn’t to plan. Our job includes 3 responsibilities. 1. To dream. 2. To believe that dream is attainable. And 3. To work hard everyday towards that dream. Let God handle the rest.

As you go throughout this week replaying this project that changed my life and lots of yours too, I want to leave you with this because I feel we all need it. Read this as if these words were yours, because they are.

In 5 years I have come so far. I am grateful to be here today, alive and full of potential. But I am not satisfied. I still want more. I still have dreams, even bigger now than before. I will not settle or conform. I rededicate myself to greatness. I give my time and my passion to my craft, because I realize that the work I put in today affects the life that I live tomorrow. I believe in myself. And to all those that doubt me I say, “Fuck that. I will be Greater. Watch me.”
- Cole

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you know my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
And never could do no wrong
You had everything sewed up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you know my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Verse 3]
Well, in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you know my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Bridge]
Well shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
If that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you know my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Last time I got here, before I even arrived, they had ‘fuck Kanye’ on the motherfuckin’ port-a-potties. But this year, we gon’ piss on ‘em, on they motherfuckin’ port-a-potties.

How many of y'all don't give a fuck about what the press say? It's 2014. College Dropout came out 2004. I want y'all to know, every time I go to the studio, every time I do an interview, every time I make a motherfuckin' t-shirt, the thing I do, I give it everything I got. And when I talk that shit, it's so that you can talk that shit. If you a fan of me, you a fan of your motherfuckin' self. You can do something that'll change the world. Look at how they try to make me look. They try to make me look crazy. And the people that write that? I don't see them performing for 90,000 motherfuckers … I know you seen movies and shit. Jimi Hendrix. John Lennon. Jim Morrison. I know y'all seen movies and shit. But y'all livin' a movie right motherfucking now. Because I AM THE NUMBER ONE MOTHERFUCKING ROCK STAR ON THE PLANET.

You know, I had a meeting with Oprah Winfrey. She wanted to give me some advice. What she told me was that the corporations are scared of me. I'm like, 'Little ol' me?! Why you scared of me?! Because I tell the kids the truth?! Why y'all scared of me?!' Why they so scared of me? … Little ol' me?' Because I want peoples' minds to finally be free. What's the new cool? What's the new cool? Can you tell me what's the new cool? Because I want to hide behind that. I need some new barricade to hide behind. I need a new cool. What's the new shit out? What's the new shit out with the most commercials at the Super Bowl? Let's just stop the music and play a Bruno Mars song right now, how about that? They told me I would never play at the Super Bowl. They told me I could never play at the Super Bowl. Not until I'm super old. Not until I'm super old … They told me I would never play at the Super Bowl. They told me I would never play at the Super Bowl, at least not until I'm super old. So I think it's time—hold up, f—k that toast.

But I promise y'all tonight, as I stand here, 37-years-old, this is only the beginning. This is only the beginning … Because in all honesty, I'm not gonna lie to y'all right now, this might not come off as humble, but I'm gonna tell y'all the truth. I ain't concerned about nobody that's actually living. I know people get mad at me when I compare myself, but that's the only way I can explain what my aspirations are. When I'm talkin' 'bout Walt Disney, when I'm talkin' 'bout Howard Hughes, when I'm talkin' 'bout Henry Ford, when I'm talkin' 'bout Beethoven, when I talk about Mozart, when I talk about Shakespeare, and they all had their time on this earth. And I'm only 37. And right now I'm rockin' to 90,000, of y'all motherfuckers right now. So I ain't goin' at anybody on the radio. I'm goin' after Shakespeare. I'm goin' after Walt Disney. I'm going after Howard Hughes. I'm going after David Stern. I'm goin' after Henry Ford. I'm going after Elon Musk. Okay, he is living, but he's my boy. Whether you believe it or not … you can only achieve as high as you believe. You can only achieve as high as you believe … And just like Martin had a dream, and just like Kendrick had a dream. I believe in everything. I believe in anything. You can only believe … I can only stand here when I been fucked up so many times. Fucked up so many times … And I know that I ain't perfect. But everything I'm not makes me everything I am.

I came to Bonnaroo six months after my mom passed. Pearl Jam went on three hours long. I did the Glow In The Dark show here. My shit was going on when the motherfuckin' daylight was comin' on. They said I was runnin' late. They blared my motherfuckin' tanks, my cryo, my pyro, they wrote 'FUCK KANYE' on that shit. Y'all wrote that shit in the press. WHERE THE PRESS AT? Y'all gonna write all these motherfuckers puttin' they hands up right now? WHERE THE PRESS AT? WHERE THE PRESS AT? WHERE THE PRESS AT? Man, I'll run that shit. This is real rock n' roll. If you ever grew up on real music, the reason why you write that shit about music? I'm from the South Side of Chicago. I dreamed of R. Kelly giving me a deal.

Somebody told me that everybody on the plane was coming out here to Bonnaroo, to come check me out, and you know, it humbled me. It humbled me, and at the same time gave me confidence. It gave me a quiet confidence, a steel confidence, a feeling that it was actually gonna happen, a feeling that it was God's plan. God's plan. God's plan, something I could never understand, understand, understand, it's all in God's plan. God's plan. God's plan. God's plan … So whether you believe it or not … the fact that there are so many people here tonight, it humbles me. It humbles me—but not in the Webster's definition of humility. It humbles me in a way that gives me strength, to know that it's in God's plan. And I know I set my goals very high.

[Hook]
She don’t give a fuck
She don’t ever stress me
We don’t even talk
All we do is sex and leave
No, there’s no love
She don’t even like me
But if we have drugs

When we have drugs
When we have drugs
When we have drugs
When we have drugs

[Verse 1]
I got lost up in it
Got lost up in it, got high for a minute
Said, my lust for life
And these lights are bright and I love these women

But she fine as fuck, so I find the rhythm
No love is greater
In this whole world, we made up
This love is made-up, it’s made-up
It’s made-up, it’s made-up, it’s made-up (Say, aye)
I don’t know this bitch but I love this shit
And we both feel splendid
And she loud as fuck, so I grab and touch
And she don’t get offended

She don’t like me, dog, she just like the drugs
My nigga, don’t get it twisted

[Bridge]
How many more can you give to me?
How many more can you give to me?

Look at me dead in the eyes, tell me you ain’t in love

You my one and only

But you take the drink when I offer fluid
No love is greater
In this whole world, we made up
This love is made-up, it’s made-up
It’s made-up, it’s made-up, it’s made-up
I can say right now that I’ll lay you down

And you high as fuck so we parasailing

Meek Milly is back

But the coppers want to arrest him like a cardiac
So I'mma Dodge 'em like a Charger, Magnum, or Viper
Your bitch need service, I’m the plumber that will pipe her
I spit game to em like I’m in the cypher
That’s why I knock em down like the bowling alley, strikers
And I be shitting on niggas like a diaper
The way I kill shit, shit I should be a lifer
They say my bars be on point like a sniper
Just call me Malvo, I’m strapped liked Velcro

Ain’t had no pot to piss in, so I just broke down pigeons
Put my youngins on missions, gave em jobs and had em shifting
We had them sort of sniffing, chop a bag and deliver
If you want it you get it, I don’t just talk it I live it
You do rap for a living, I do rap for a hobby
Put my name in your rap and watch how I catch a new body
If the labels don’t sign me, I ain’t crying, on ryan
I just hit my connect and get some more brick on consignment
He know I run right through it, you know that’s how I do it
You see them FA troopers, get to moving cause they shooting
I got homies like Diddy, and my nigga Meek Milly
If they come along with me, trust me it’s not gon be pretty
Know I rep for my city, that’s the city of Philly
Get money, fuck bitches, you try me I’ll show you this milly

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - ?]
I got my seat laid back, I’m chilling
Strapped with a mac in the back of the will
Use two hands when I’m clapping it still
Got a pack full of crack and a pack full of pills
Because we hustle for the muscle
Could get clapped in the back for the scrill

[?] came back and he back for the thrill
Yeah 

[?] came back and he back for the thrill
I’m in my brown paper bag, and I think I’m taking over
See my fridge and freezer empty, but this ice and baking soda
So we take it to the plot, chop it up and make them boulders
Shouts out to the fiends that paid us
Shouts out to the fiends that owe us
CH, we sliding through, on some shit that’s Windex blue
And the windows tinted too, so the haters can’t see through
I be in the projects too, posted up right in the circle
If you think of coming through then them boys will probably hurt you
Time is my money dog, so every minute man
That money money calling, fucking up my minute plan
I’m on my shit again, you know what time it is
You want the streets, turn out no P, you want no drama kid

[Hook]
Fuck bitches, get money, get money and fuck bitches
You know that I’m a G, I’m a G
Get money, get money and fuck bitches
You know it’s MOB

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Fuck love, all I got for hoes is hard dick and bubble gum, haha

[Chorus: Drake & Mac Miller]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything (Uh-huh), other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear, I can spend whatever on it (Sike)
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up (When i hit her)
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up (Then i quit her)
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up (Roll a Swisher)
And I say the same thing every single time (What)
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Fuck you)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Uh)
I say, you the fuckin'—

[Verse: Mac Miller]
I used to be a player who was searchin' for the one
Scared of bein' me 'cause it was hurtin' me to love
But then I found somethin' that I thought was real
You know, the type of girl you could cop a meal for
See, life is real good on the come up
I used to hit my lady with a text when the sun up, like, "What up?"
And I gave it all away just to fall
Now I'm waitin' on the day when she call
Nah, fuck that, 'cause nowadays love is always lose
My heart's stayin' bruised if I'm givin' it to you
So I'ma keep playin' girls like they was a instrument
Try and find the one is just ridiculous, I'm sick of it
'Cause I found out that every girl the same
They sayin' that they victims but they love to play the game
So I ain't feel ashamed for who I am
And love don't really drive me to do these jams
But I tell y'all everything I write about
All the ups and downs, then the smiles, frowns
The good, bad, ugly, funny, and the money
The honeys, the grumpy, the hungry, whatever, haha
'Cause my life has never been better
She can't break what's underneath the polo or my sweater
And that's my heart, so fuck a heartbreak
This was just a little case of some heartache

[Verse 1]
I'm standing on the yacht, smokin' by the dock (Dre)
Got a couple thots, that think I'm hot (ewww)
These rappers think they hot, they really not
Maserati coupe, then I drop the top
I'm two hundred bands, foreign off the lot
I'm IHOP syrup, pouring up my guap
I'm fiending Ferragamo, each and every time
I'm hopin' out the cut, with shooters that make you blind
I got a foreign whip and a Maybach that's behind it
I gotta engine in the trunk and it go fire (and it go fire)
I'm lil dre, I'm big Soulja, I'm panamera
I'm west side, zone 1, red bandana

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm on the private jet, I finesse

Pull up on a block, AKA a' heatin'
Chopper, it's goin' find, and make ya blind
If, if she in my whip, you know she a dime
I like to get the chicken's whipped, that's all the time
He said he need thirty bricks, and I'm like, 'fine'
Rat-tat-tat with a 

[?]

[Hook]

[Verse]
My flow sicker, your dough thick, well my dough thicker
You talk shit, I will kick your door nigga
I call my goons, my brand new chopper is coming soon
Aluminum, titanium, I'm spinning this brainium, this brainium
Hit the club, make it rain
Ball just like major pain, fall if you touch my chain
Soulja Boy I'll bust your brain
Niggas talking all that shit
Y'all niggas cannot represent
Fucking with a young ass killer, young ass gorilla nigga
Split ya, I deal with ya, figure, pick it, head 'em, get it

I'm on another level bitch you heard me say that, didn't you?
S.O.D. I never mentioned you because you not worthy
Nigga 

[?], shot me with the brand new camera, flashing
S.O.D. be gassing, gassing, bouncing
Putting niggas in caskets, I'm whole
I'm up smoking dope and choke off the smoke, I roll
Hit the block and I shine, hit the block and I grind
You on the same shit, the lame chips, the game bitch
With the same clips, extended it and winning, I'm getting it
S.O.D. game mentioned it on, S.O.D. game winning it
In the fucking game, nigga pass me the ball
And watch a nigga ball, I'm Gucci to the draws
Money over all, I don't really give a fuck
Tatted on my neck on throat and them girls lick me up
Man I swear I pick you off the ground
If you make a fucking sound
Disrespect my fucking crew
Bitch, is you fucking clown?
It go down when you disrespect, choppers will hit your fucking neck
Show respect for it will be the last thing you fucking say

[Hook]
Get the fuck back nigga, we up in the club
High as fuck, talk shit and you gon' get dropped
Mean mug, nigga you gon' mug who?

Choppers on me, niggas we don't give a fuck

Fuck your mean mugs, nigga, fuck your mean mug
Fuck your mean mugs, nigga, fuck your mean mug

[Outro]
Get the fuck back nigga, S.O.D. in this bitch nigga

[Verse 1]
And he took whats left and he made for the door
Oh so fast, oh so fast
While his act of theft put a smile on his face
But it won't last, it won't last, no

[Chorus]
Will you decide to put this behind you
Will you decide to put this behind you
Will you decide to put this behind you
Will you decide to put this behind you now

[Verse 2]
And I gave my coat to the one I loved
We would walk, we would walk
But she changed the pace and she turned her head
She said it's not us, we're not old enough, no

[Chorus]
Will you decide to put this behind you
Will you decide to put this behind you
Will you decide to put this behind you
Will you decide to put this behind you now
Will you decide to put this behind you
Will you decide to put this behind you
Will you decide to put this behind you
Will you decide to put this behind you now

[Verse 1]
When we look at the Summer Sun, yellow and round
So we go out to the hill and we lie down
All but one sits in the corner
Trying to find a way

[Chorus]
And alright let's go outside
And rise, rise, rise to the meaning of life
And we're crying
We're all falling out
I want to go back to old times

[Verse 2]
And looking back, looking out at different things
We flew too high; let the Sun burn our wings
We never thought it would be us
Let it all come fast, turn to dust

[Chorus]
And alright let's go outside
And rise, rise, rise to the meaning of life
And we're crying
We're all falling out
I want to go back to old times
And alright let's go outside
And rise, rise, rise to the meaning of life
And we're crying
We're all falling out
I want to go back to old times
And alright let's go outside
And rise, rise, rise to the meaning of life
And we're crying
We're all falling out
I want to go back to old times
And alright let's go outside
Rise, rise, rise to the meaning of life
And we're crying
We're all falling out
I want to go back to old times

[Verse 1]
Well, so far we had some
But it doesn't work for everyone
But I'm thinking this could be the one
If we put our minds to it
And I came round today
And you thought I had so much to say
And I know you hate seeing me this way
But I'm having fun

[Pre-Chorus]
You realise, you realise
It's real life, it's real life
You realise, you realise
It's real life, it's real life
You realise, you realise
It's real life, it's real life
You realise, you realise
It's real life, it's real life

[Chorus]
Trying to prove you're alright
And losing track of the time
Even with the summer passing by

[Verse 2]
I'm bringing it down into focus
I try to bring it down, but I'm hopeless
And we should write this down, so we can remember it
And yes there was a time when we were
Two of a kind, but now I can't even remember why

[Pre-Chorus]
You realise, you realise
It's real life, it's real life
You realise, you realise
It's real life, it's real life

[Chorus]
Trying to prove you're alright
And losing track of the time
Sixteen hits on the side
And don't waste any time inside
Even with the Summer passing by

[Outro]
I won't burn when it's not
My turn, and I just
Can't learn anymore
I won't burn when it's not
My turn, and I just
Can't learn anymore

[Verse 1]
So you think you've had a walk in the park
You don't think you've been working too hard
It looks like he's been opening up
He don't want to but he can't stop, can't stop

[Chorus]
And what's the name you try to find?

[Verse 2]
And did you see the way she appeared?
She's the type that knows everyone here
Know the face but I don't know the name
Know her friends and you know she's just the same

[Chorus]
And what's the name you try to find?

[Verse 3]
Open house and I'm opening up
I don't want to but I can't stop, can't stop
Open house and I'll never calm down
Clear it up when the morning comes around

[Chorus]
And what's the name you try to find?

[Verse 1]
Cancel on me again
Oh, cancel on me again
And it's not your fault and again
No it's not your fault you said
Oh

[Chorus]
All the world has come to see the end
And you will never see this place again
And all the world has come to see the end
And you will never see my face again

[Verse 2]
No it's not your fault and again
No it's not your fault you said
So cancel on me again
Oh, cancel on me again
Oh

[Chorus]
All the world has come to see the end
And you will never see this place again
And all the world has come to see the end
And you will never see my face again

[Chorus]
All the world has come to see the end
And you will never see this place again
And all the world has come to see the end
And you will never see my face again

[Bridge]
I'm dreaming of you pushing up to me
And I know where it's going to lead
Dreaming of you rushing up to me
And you know where it's where you want to be
Dreaming of you pushing up to me
And I know where it's going to lead
Dreaming of you rushing up to me
That was the boy I used to be

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm dreaming of you rushing
I'm dreaming of you rushing
I'm dreaming of you rushing up to me

[Verse 1]
She seemed like an alright girl
And I was thinking just one night won't hurt
And I remember saying to her
I don't want to get much older

[Chorus]
So Long
So Long
So Long

[Verse 2]
Always seem to be on the run
We haven't spoken in so long
We can't get past the 'how are you?'
We're not talking like we used to

[Chorus]
So Long
So Long
So Long

[Verse 3]
Always seem to be on the run
We haven't spoken in so long
We can't get past the 'how are you?'
We're not talking like we used to

[Chorus]
So Long
(Where it ends, and where it has to go)
So Long
(Where it ends, and where it has to go)
(Where it ends, and where it has to go)

[Verse 1]
Chasing the dream, no I never pick up the pen
Always assured but I like it when we pretend
You should be around, they should just say when
You should make time; you should make time for them

[Chorus]
My ever-changing ghost
I think he loves them the most
He always shows you where and how and when you went wrong

[Verse 2]
Always planned but never get things done
I walk in the room and see you waltzing around
The love that you give is such a familiar sound
You just fly straight up and calm the fuck down
You see a house fall because you built it on the wrong ground

[Chorus]
My ever-changing ghost
I think he loves them the most
The most
He always shows you

[Verse 1]
Whatever happened to saying this was the last time
At least for a while
And he looks so worried, but you hate how he looks at life
With such a closed mind

[Chorus]
Too much, too fast
We should be heading back
No questions asked
It's always sailing past

[Verse 2]
Have you learned your lesson
Have you learnt to always think things through
'Cause you keep on changing what you think is right
What is true, but only when it suits you

[Bridge]

[?]
For nothing's hit the wall
Too many mornings saying
That wasn't me at all

[Chorus]
Too much, too fast
We should be heading back
No questions asked
It's always sailing past

[Bridge]
His height, won't last
His height, won't last

[Chorus]
Too much, too fast
We should be heading back
No questions asked
It's always sailing past

[Chorus]
Too much, too fast (

[?])
We should be heading back (For nothing's hit the wall)
No questions asked (Too many mornings saying)
It's always sailing past (That wasn't me at all)

[Verse 1]
You mirror gaze while I decide
The moment you were deified
You turn as if your mind replies
If your devout is insurmountable

[Chorus]
These scattered flashes are divine
They can't help but sway your mind

[Verse 2]
Never really put me right
The words we said by dim lamplight
Bodies cold and intertwined
I feel the spirit, I feel the

[Chorus]
These scattered flashes are divine
They can't help but sway your mind
These scattered flashes are divine
They can't help but sway your mind

[Chorus]
These scattered flashes are divine
They can't help but sway your mind

[Verse 1]
Always adrift--there are trips to make
The night won't break, if the day won't break
When I was out, did you get in?
Did you draw the right stuff on your skin?
Say:

[Chorus]
I am ready to owe you anything
I am ready to owe you anything
I am ready to owe you anything
I am ready to owe you anything

[Refrain](x2)
Oh, we can, we can, we can (Oo-oo-oo-oo)
Oh, we can, we can, we can (Oo-oo-oo-oo)
(we can) Oh, we can, we can, we can (Oo-oo-oo-oo)
(we can) Oh, we can, we can, we can (Oo-oo-oo-oo)

[Verse 2]
Keep with me, I hope you'll see that
We can speak at slower speeds
When I wake up it will always be that
When I wake up it will always be that
I am ready to

[Chorus]
I am ready to owe you anything
I am ready to owe you anything
I am ready to owe you anything
I am ready to owe you anything

[Outro]
And that's the way to work it out
And that's the way to work it out
And that's the way to work it out
And that's the way to work it out

[Verse 1]
Now it's decision time
Which one will stay which one will say goodbye
And just my luck to find
Someone that makes me want to leave her behind

[Chorus]
We took the backseat, everyone was happy
We took the back where everybody left
We took the backseat, everyone was happy

[Verse 2]
Now it's decision time
Which one will stay which one will say goodbye
And I've woken up in so many rooms
I'm sorry that I left so soon, I
Didn't want to break anybody's mood
'Cause last night you woke me up
We almost fell in love
But then you said
It is time for bed, uh-oh

[Chorus]
We took the backseat, everyone was happy
We took the back where everybody left
We took the backseat, everyone was happy

[Verse 1]
Coming back from the scene you started
Got your head on the window slanted
The thought of your skin, it sets it off
At the back of a red container
I pray that a black hole take her
Gone from sight and never back and never back

[Chorus](x2)
Going back away I waste away
Going back away I waste away
Going back away, no way, no way
Going back away I waste away

[Verse 2]
Sat alone 'til the lightning got me
Something I can't just say softly
I'mma set the height and keep you up
At the back of the red container
Pray that the lightning take her
Gone from sight and never back and never back

[Chorus](x2)
Going back away I waste away
Going back away I waste away
Going back away, no way, no way
Going back away I waste away

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus](x2)
Going back away I waste away
Going back away I waste away
Going back away, no way, no way
Going back away I waste away

[Verse 1]
And every time I walk away from you
There's never time
To say what I really had in mind

[Chorus]
And people try, they never know what's right
It's all the same
A different life behind every face
But I can't change
I've seen a different page
It's in my head
And I can't turn my back

[Verse 2]
And every word I try to say to you
I never say at the right time
In the right way
And every feeling waiting to escape
And suffocate
Every night and every day

[Chorus]
People try, they never know what's right
It's all the same
A different life behind every face
Well I can't change
I've seen a different pain
It's in my head
And I won't turn my back

[Verse 1]
When the light's out
And all of the fracturing starts
You're just paying
For some action you lost in the dark

[Chorus]
You come down, holding tight, to the railing on the side
You stay down, left to dry, now you're crumbling

[Verse 2]
Now your guard's down
And all of the timing has gone
You were patient
'Til earth swallowed the last of the sun

[Chorus]
You come down, holding tight, to the railing on the side
You stay down, left to dry, now you're crumbling

[Outro]
It's not complex, see all of the signs flashing on
You're just paying, for all of the bad you have done

[Verse 1]
Once is better than a lifetime
Once is better than a whole long side
When you catch in the humble life
He can get it in the after
He can hold it in the molar while
When the back of her gets so damn worked over

[Chorus]
Where's the lightning? Where's the lightning?
Where's the lightning now?
Wear your fingers, wear your fingers
Wear your fingers now
He can taste it, he can taste it
He can taste it now
Come and get it, come and get it
Come and get it now

[Verse 2]
Once is better than a lifetime
Once is better than a whole long side
When you catch it in the humble life
He can get it in the after
He can hold it in the molar while
When the back of her gets so damn worked over

[Bridge]
Thinking what he'll ask her then
Oh this misery come when
Sitting on a silver throne
Waiting up but you're not home

[Chorus]
Where's the lightning? Where's the lightning?
Where's the lightning now?
Wear your fingers, wear your fingers
Wear your fingers now
He can taste it, he can taste it
He can taste it now
Come and get it, come and get it
Come and get it now

[Verse 1]
When the beat of your mind
Starts to sway out of time
Like the first song of the night
You can say that you won't
But you know oh oh you might
And she's there in the hall
With her praises and all
Yet her hand swears not to tell
Cost a lie to meet you
Fare-the-well

[Verse 2]
And it seems when you wake
Every movement you make
You can count on your rastful luck
There's a sight or a song
That kicks those feelings up
Its the way you have carried
It over the years
And the feeling it's all too fast
You were pouring your heart
From glass to glass

[Verse]
Chasing the night
To make it right
Oh and you had it
Caught like a rabbit
Told you to wait
But it's too late
You got your man
Rinsing him down
Turning your head
To mine instead
Gave me the eyes
Burning like light

[Verse]
One spur in the fire, burning
Now we're clearing the embers away
There are many ways this way
So I tell you like you're meant to
And you're quick to guess my choice
Was it my trembling hand or my voice?
She said you're stirring
Tossing, turning
Just like you were in the night
I am sure your choice is right
I've always been a coward
Been a coward to this day
There are many ways this way
And your fortune taken from you
By men that always say
There are many ways this way

[Verse 1]
Now your back's to the road
The waiting's everything you know

[Chorus]
I'm sure you know that I'm leaving

[Verse 2]
Riding home everyday
Sure in a cinematic way
Breathing the smoke of the train
Keep the thought of you aflame

[Chorus]
I'm sure you know that I'm leaving

[Verse 3]
Curse god for my regret
I miss you indefinite
Not once did i think that
Love would stay 'til I came back
Now your back's to the road
The waiting's everything you know

[Chorus]
I'm sure you know that I'm leaving

[Verse 1]
If you want ride a rainbow come with me
I will take you in a magic purple sea
Maybe we will find a thousand sugar fish
And when you eat them they will grant your every wish

[Chorus]
And if you want your friends to come then bring them all along

[Verse 2]
If you want to catch a star then walk my way
I will take you where the night is always day
You can follow me if you really try
Maybe we will find a rainbow, teach it to fly

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Bow your head and let your eyelids close on down
Where we're going you won't need to bring your frown
You will find that all the things that I have said
Will come true when you are lying in your bed

[Chorus]

[Verse]
All of the voices
Spelling it out
Where are the plans you're thinking about
Rest him assured
It comes overnight
Writing it down and tearing it up
If i could tell you
Gradually
Word by word, you'd take it from me
It would be over
Instantly
Landing us where you thought we would be

[Verse]
Old dust, old dirt, they're mine and only mine
I'm just some mortal, you are so divine
You control the game without playing it right
Raise high in me what once did sink below
All dark within now radiantly glows
Come on take me back all that time ago
Our love was just one of your discarded jewels
You think back to it's price and oh you feel a fool
But in that certain light, it looked so beautiful

[Verse 1]
All the highs are downwards
All your fumble words are spent
Paying no attention
To the thoughts of your dear friend

[Chorus]
No point louder
The sound of my power
Sink in deeper
Further each hour
My god

[Verse 2]
When our flower's fading
When our stem begins to fold
I will take off quietly
Like a bird that flees the cold

[Chorus]
No point louder
The sound of my power
Sink in deeper
Further each hour
My god

[x7]

[Verse 1]
Taking the second plan
Begging to understand
Life of a selfless man

[Chorus]
Cause out of all the flaws I've stumbled on
It's the hardest one to focus on
It's the hardest one to focus on

[Verse 2]
Why are you calling up?
Isn't one enough?
Giving up all she's got

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
If you want to come on down
Down with your bones so white
And watch while the freight trains pound
Into the wild, wild night

[Verse 1]
How I would love to gnaw
To gnaw on your bones so white
And watch while the freight trains pour
Into the wild, wild night
How I d-twain

[x2]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Can I have your wayward stare?
Never mind him calling you, just keep them there

[Chorus]
Why do you keep me back?
With all your powers I am pushing at

[Verse 2]
No never can it be
These are the words that you once said to me

[Chorus]
Why do you keep me back?
With all your powers I am pushing at

[Outro]
No I'm not home enough
Then I get back and you have taken off
No never can it be
I guess I'd like to think it was bad timing
Timing, timing, timing

[Intro]
Ha ha ha ha

[Verse 1]
Light trips, sweat drips
Come party in my basement
Man, I'm gonna get you wasted
Yeah, just enough for you to taste it
Cash this, get rich
Feel it 'til you're famous
Party in my basement
Just enough for you to taste it

[Chorus]
Dropping bombs (Atomic)
Come on people, let me through
Dropping bombs (Atomic)
Making waves across the room
Dropping bombs (Atomic)
I've got nothing left to lose
Dropping bombs (Atomic)
I'm dropping bombs on you

[Verse 2]
Night shift, killed it
You won't need no replacement
I'm gonna make a statement
'Cause I wanna watch you chase it
Cash flow, down low
Money just like chocolate
I'm gonna make you famous
Come party in my basement

[Chorus]
Dropping bombs (Atomic)
Come on people, let me through
Dropping bombs (Atomic)
Making waves across the room
Dropping bombs (Atomic)
I've got nothing left to lose
Dropping bombs (Atomic)
I'm dropping bombs on you

[Bridge]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Can I get you? Can I get you?
Can I get you super-size? Can't you see it in my eyes?
You know I wanted that, I'm flashing out my dollar signs
Can I get you super-size? Can't you see it in my eyes?
You know I wanted that, I'm flashing out my dollar signs

[Breakdown]
Come party in my basement
Come party in my basement (Atomic)
Come party in my basement
Meow, woof woof, I'm making

[Chorus]
Dropping bombs (Atomic)
Come on people, let me through
Dropping bombs (Atomic)
Making waves across the room
Dropping bombs (Atomic)
I've got nothing left to lose
Dropping bombs (Atomic)
I'm dropping bombs on you

[Verse 1]
Your guard isn't on, your barriers open
Your words have now gone, the whole town waiting
My army is down, my company old
And leaving, quiet and burned
Those nights we sought all the words
And if I could have one more guardian on the wall

[Chorus]
Riding a fleet of beggars and cons
Taking it back, it won't be long

[Verse 2]
Your name you have kept, the part you've taken
So carefully planned, each word you've spoken
My army is down, my company old
And leaving, quiet and burned
Those nights we sought all the words
And if I could have one more guardian on the wall

[Chorus]
Riding a fleet of beggars and cons
Taking it back, it won't be long

[Intro]
Your flesh and bone, your flesh and bone
Your flesh and bone, your flesh and bone
Your flesh and bone, your flesh and bone
Your flesh and bone, your flesh and bone
Your flesh and bone, your flesh and bone
Your flesh and bone, your flesh and bone

You come down to take it on, but
You already know it’s gone, and
It's oh, been this way for long and

[Verse 1]
If I gotta ride like you want
Eating up whatever you got
Keeping my lies up, you know
Oh you force it all, oh you need it all

[Verse 2]
Trying to keep a face up tonight
Even when the guy's got you right
Coming off the wrong side, you know
Oh you force it all

[Chorus]
You start it right, you tread so light
You tease this love, you care enough

[Verse 3]
You can rearrange me now
If we wait we can make it somehow
What you want, what you want
Anything you want

[Chorus]
You start it right, you tread so light
You tease this love, you care enough

You start it right, you tread so light
You tease this love, you care enough

You start it right, you tread so light
You tease this love, you care enough

[Verse 1]
With our backs all turned to morning light
And all our timing gone
We can find some common surface
To put all our worries on
We can pour them out, or let them drip
Then split them one by one
They can dry out, let them lie out
In the eyes of the morning sun

[Chorus]
Don't stop waiting, waiting
(Don't stop,)
'Til you feel it all

[Verse 2]
When I left you weighing the choices out
Then all the light had gone
You had tied the ends together
Made them fight out all night long
Now the good half turns to what you had
The bad half's giving up
You can tear it out and bury it, put all your worries off

[Chorus]
Don't stop waiting, waiting
(Don't stop,)
'Til you feel it all

[Bridge]

'Til you feel it all
'Til you feel it all
'Til you feel it all
'Til you feel it all

[Verse  1]
Feeling heart beats steal my lovers sound
When I thought my soul burnt out
Oh, I beg you come back
I beg you come back
I beg you come
Make it out of there and say you feel it now
Want you to feel it, breathe it, let it take you down
Take your time, don't throw it out

[Chorus]
Oh, I beg you come back
I beg you come back
I beg you come
Just get out of there and say you need it now
Won't you come and pass the time?
Lay your head toward the more, she left behind
Appease my mind
So it's just this once
It's all I want

[Bridge]
I know I'm stealing love and trading out its light
I'll find my own some time

[Chorus]
I beg you come back

[x2]
I beg you come
Just get out of there and say you needed mine
Won't you come and pass the time?
Lay your head toward the more, she left behind
Appease my mind
Let the heart decide
Come on face this side
So it's just this once
It's all I need
It's all I ever want

[Hook: Bob Marley & The Wailers]
The stone that the builder refuse
Will always be the head cornerstone, (sing it brother)
The stone that the builder refuse
Will always be the head cornerstone

[Verse 1: Bob Marley]
You're a builder, baby
Here I am, a stone
Don't you think and refuse me
Cause the things people refuse
Are the things they should use
Do you hear me? Hear what I say

[Hook]
The stone that the builder refuse
Will always be the head cornerstone, (tell me why)
The stone that the builder refuse
Will always be the head cornerstone

[Verse 2: Bob Marley]
Here I am baby
I'm a builder's stone
Don't you think and refuse me, listen
The things people refuse
Are the things they should use
Do you hear me? Hear what I say

[Hook]
(The stone that the builder refuse
Will always be the head cornerstone) x2
The stone that the builder refuse (I can be soft as a pillow)
Will always be the head cornerstone (weep like a willow)
The stone that the builder refuse (courage)
Will always be the head cornerstone (brings happiness, don't refuse me)
The stone that the builder refuse (don't you refuse)
Will always be the head cornerstone (don't you, don't you, don't you)

[Verse 1]
All you have made is
A bird with injured wings
That flies without progress
In a circle, hovering
There's dark in your eyes now
Your parents cannot see
And all of your secrets
Stare only toward me, me

[Chorus]
It's not getting easier
Easier to let go
If I was smarter
'Would have never let you know

[Verse 2]
All you have made is
A bird with injured wings
That flies without progress
In a circle, hovering
There's dark in your eyes now
Your parents cannot see
And all of your secrets
Stare only toward me, me

[Chorus 2]
It's getting easier
Easier to get hurt
If I could start over
I would get to you first

[Verse 1: Bob Marley]
The sun shall not smite I by day
Nor the moon by night
And everything that I do
Shall be up-full and right

[Hook: Bob Marley & The Wailers]
And if it's all night
It got to be (alright)
(Talking to you) all night
(It got to be) all right

[Verse 2: Bob Marley]
Ima' not lose this one
I'm the lucky one, under the sun
If you make me move
Then you know, you got to groove
A do ya' like it?
A do ya' like it?
Do ya'?
Do ya'?
Do ya'?
Do ya'?

[Hook]
If it's (all night)
Got to be (all right)
I'm workin' (all night)
Got to be (all right)

[Verse 3: Bob Marley]
See (all night), I Work for my pay (all right), night and day (all night)
Work for my pay (all right), night and day (no, no, no, no, no, noo, ooh, no, no, no, no, no, noo, ooh )
Can't you feel it (no, no, no, no, noo, ooh, no, no, no, no, noo, ooh )
If it's, if it's, if it's, it's got to be (alright)
If it's (all night), if it's (alright)
Do you like it (all right)
I talk old (all right), square our fold (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
Break it back, tear a drop
Wipe a tears from your eyes, and don't ya' cry
Wipe them lonely tears, baby
I'll tell you why

If it's all night, got to be (alright)
If it's all night, got to be (alright)
(All right) know that I'm a stranger, in your town

[Verse 1]
I'll get my feelings out
I don't care where or how
I know I said begone
Well I'm searching for you now
Your feet, they never found
A firm hold on the ground
Your eyes are burning up
And I need to calm you down

[Chorus]
I don't want you to the bone
I just need to lay down with soft skin close to my own

[Verse 2]
The rattled stones had found
I stumbled to the ground
The houses up above
And the way you pin me down
I promise Lord, I can
Let me be my true love's man
I'll pack her up and run
To a quiet seaside town

[Chorus]
I don't want you to the bone
I just need to lay down with soft skin close to my own

[Outro]
Until my true love's home

[Verse 1]
Going way beyond the line
Hoping, hoping you're alright
And I'm feeling
Feeling old and tired
I'm feeling, feeling old life

[Chorus]
But I won't lie
No, I won't lie
Will you, won't you?
Will you, won't you?

[Verse 2]
Sending all these different signs
But yours aren't quite the same as mine
But I'm feeling, feeling old and tired
I'm feeling, feeling old life

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Will you, won't you?

[x2]

[Verse 1]
The moment we forgot we were just good friends
I moved my arm, her face went red again
One more bus home, another silent weekend

[Chorus]
You said love was painted gold
Like all things growing old
The paint peels and slowly falls
You already know(x3)

[Verse 2]
Looking out the glass though we sit together
We both know we could be someone better
Not with our heads like London weather

[Chorus]
You said love was painted gold
Like all things growing old
The paint peels and slowly falls
You already know(x3)

[Outro]
You already know

[Verse 1]
And it's one long journey
I want to last
To walk home talking
Of the night just passed
To stop me then
I know not when
You said, "make it end"

[Chorus]
When the towers are shaking, I know
Breaking, I know

[Verse 2]
And the weights were lifted
One by one
And you shot me over, over
With a silenced gun
And you solved it then
But I know not when
You made it end

[Chorus]
When the towers are shaking, I know
Breaking, I know
When the towers are shaking, I know
Breaking, I know

[Intro]
My cup is running over, I don't know what to do

No water can quench my thirst

Ooh we, what other bottle, sweeter the victory

Pull up to my show see all the peoples fall in love
Salute all the DJ, they do this shit for Thug
They know I came straight up from the floor just like a rug
They know I smell like YSL so they ready for hugs
Hundred racks in my trousers, I’m groovy like Austin Powers
You knowing just not to touch me unless a Young Thug allow it
I bless the bitch with allowance, you want packs I’m gonna file it

Whatever I get Imma give back to my hood homies
And that’s love, raising me in the hood homie (big ups)

[Bridge]
I cut in a motherfucker’s breath
80 chains sitting on my motherfucking dresser
I give you 500 but little D could go in lesser
All I  know is ride around with J’s, they the testers
Alligator crocodile with bumps, just like eczema
Black and white marble floors in the house like checkers
Gave her two bands inside of Lenox, that’s just my tender
And you know my jewelry sip of water
I spoil her, your daughter

[Verse 1]
She just want me down so we slide off four quarters
And we know how I chain like Marlboros, I love em
Fucked the girl once, and no call her, no bother
Plus I stole money from my mother and father
Call up MPA Duke and tell him pull up in the charger
500 deep the nigga mug, he might be retarded
I just hit a crip, bitch she think I play with the dodgers
Uncle Phil picked me up from Crim, I ridin on Marta

[Chorus]
I got me a golden gun
I got me a golden gun
I still blow trust funds
I still blow trust funds
I throw a whole lot of ones
I throw a whole lot of ones
We fuck hoes by the groups
We don't do no ones

[Bridge]
I cut in a motherfucker’s breath

Gave her two bands inside of Lenox, that’s just my tender
And you know my jewelry sip of water
I spoil her, your daughter

[Verse 2]
'Bout her, I'ma hit him in the back, just like Ricky
Two million dollars worth of land, just like Disney
OG swag for 5 years, nothin but chucks and dickies
All red Bentley, and that inside stuffed with bitches
On my way to Haiti (they love Haiti lingo)
All the cars foreign, little kids play bingo
Muntari Rashid, R.I.P. to Migo
All the boys in jail, free all of my people

[Chorus]
I got me a golden gun
I got me a golden gun
I still blow trust funds

[Verse 1]
I feel a little bit forgiven, Thank God
Allow me this day
I feel so high when I be living
They can’t stop me, know how
Uh uh, no way
I don’t play, me and Tim, me and him
We rocks out, L U P do that
No shoes, just some socks out
Relaxing in the club, DJ’ing
Playbacking, everything that I do
They don’t know what happen
They be trying, I deny them at the bucket I say fuck it
If they want it than they love it
If they don’t than they can suck it
And, what I mean by it
You should re-try it
I’m on my Dean, you be on a dean-diet
And I dont even like it
Everytime you rap it, I swear I close my eyes
I wish I could close my ears from this racket
I ain't having it, I tennis while you bin it
I stay on it, I strong as Popeye with some spinach
You as long as short something
You be tryna ten it see
I ain't going HAM, I’m going bacon, going pig
I’m going whole cow, look at me, what I did
You wish you could, but you just kid
I’m a grown man on it, my own man on it
Come in your house, now your home damn haunted
See everybody dead, bullet holes in the head
But I ain't kill em, I hit em with the flow instead
My flow like bullets, they like hollow tips
I wish you would if you could, if you would try it
But you can’t so back to denying the
They be lying ah
I be so up on my truthless and I’m so ruthless
Ferrari top down yeah I got like four of those
And my Ferrari so clean it got four doors
Only got two LUP on that new shit
New Ferrari 400i, that blue kit
So I got my rims and my watch and my rings on
Yeah I got my bling on
Go ahead and sing songs
If you want I tell no tales and no lies
I drop no dimes on my homies
I keep them alive behind the bar
Shout to Chilly chill, I’m so really real
And the streets so deep, you wish that I wasn’t but I am cousin
God damn he be buzzing
No weed no liquor, MD offa something
See my brain just flows and see just how I goes
And I’m from Chicago and I’m letting niggas know
You can cut it out and scratch it or baste it
Or send it through the strainer but please don’t waste it
Make sure you clean the plates when I’m done cooking
I’m Lil B, I am big ME, you little he, ahh
Sometin’ better, theres none of that, I’m running rap
Everything around it like hustling trap, stuntin that
Everything you bad at, I do so well
Then I eat the whole beat than put it on sale
That means I put it out to sea
You never get it back
It’s only coming back to me, uh
Indeed, it’s the LUP, Tim Westwood on our BBC Business

[Verse 2]
Flip the beat up and bring me another track
Some of that, uh, some up all up under that
Bring the sun back, that be me I'm so on fire
So higher like the moon and I will not retire
But maybe soon but, maybe that will be that noon uh
Then I wake you up for it and pace you up for it
Uh, if you got it take you up on it
You can roll the dice but, promise you don't want it
See, you ain't really on it, you be on some other shit
I be on some wonky shit and be on some tonky shit
Takin' it and walking' it, L U P be stalking' it
Round the corner dressed up, so tight, no light
Unlike anybody ever seen too clever
Flowing off the top of the dome to whoever's beat
Uh, and whoever's neat I'm nicer
I'm more bling, more clean, more play - no dice uh
No dice cuz, see I don't roll that
Don't believe in luck just bringin' confidence
Constantly, consequence of tryna defy is not nice
You be so dead, uh - twice
Kill 'em again, and again, and again
The adrenaline that's flowing up in him
Uh, and you know it something special
It's damn near incredible I should eat this
Uh-uh uh, uh
I lost my way but I'm back up on my path
A rapping wrath, a chaos spiting
Uh, It's more gripping
It's more intelligent and more thrilling
Than anything that they can do even though they top billing
See, I be underdoggin', I be underloggin'
Uh, it's something special someone better off them
It's damn near awesome but more like incredible
You can't eat me nigga I am so unedible
But if you swallow it's like swallowing glass
I eat you it's like swallowing grass
Got a belly full of doo
You can't stomach got a belly full of hope
The audacity of them to think they rapidly ascend
I'm so aggressive or in the rage I take them off the stage
Skytel I bring it back just got a page
I'm like Tron, step up in the 

[?] it's the Don
See what' going on and in my own world
You can keep your home girl I got the whole world
In my hands in my palms, uh something like a bomb
Around the chest of some suicide vest, nah
It's Vietnam here, you keep it calm there
Cause you don't want none of this with ya
I hit ya, and git ya, split you, and brake it down
Bag it up, go to the hood take a route
Uh, take another shot, take another three
These are all bars 

[?] music and you can't see
And can't beat what I am, that's a A+
Uh, I hope God wanna save us
If they won't save you
Play too damn much messing with the homeboy, ya
Uh, uh that L U P nigga
Yea, yea, fire flame spitta
Uh, uh that L U P nigga
Yea, yea, fire flame spitta

[Verse 3]
Fire flame spitta
On another track, don't want none of that
With no water and no slaughter
No breaks I just continue on, with no takes
I keep going, I keep flowing, no stopping that
And see everybody watching that
See I got the lock so I'll be locking that, you can't get the keys
Especially from me, I keep them so excited in my pocket
You'd better watch it, and matter of fact you'd better stop it
I'm too hot, better hopscotch it and go up down the block
You might catch a shot, one two
Blat, blat, blat -
My flow is like...Heckler and Koch
Hit you up straight
Niggas aiming for your face when I come through...
I ain't hitting hearts, I'm just aiming for the brains
Trying to make'em smarter and take'em out of danger's way
And say maintain today
I show the shorties how to maintain the way so righteous
The nicest and do it like is priceless, iceless
No, I got a couple those watches and a couple cars
And I keep a couple flows and a couple bars
And I keep a couple hoods and a couple stars
In my back pocket and you can back watch it
You better backstop it like it's cricket
I keep a wicket googly when I stick it, be like the Batman, hitcha
You can come through just like don't pitch it out
I'll knock it out the park, it'll be so dark
By the time I'm done, there'll be no sun
There'll be no one, see the crowd so empty
I'll still be there rhyming, see it don't tempt me
I don't feel guilty either, I feel so filthy when I roll
Flowing like ether, burning niggas down
Turning niggas' worlds around and show them there's better ways to get it down
Yeah, yeah, it feeling like an iPod
Look at my god and bow my head down to heaven
I pray to the East, I try to do it seven times a day
Do it my way, may god forgive me for the prayers that I didn't do
And for the fasts that I didn't fast
I hope you make my success last longer than the rest of them
Or if not keep me so intelligent that I stay beyond it and don't care about their success or their chains
I don't care nowhere, but I do care about you, don't ever let'em doubt you
Don't ever let them try to put a mouth to the violence
The silence that I bring is so deafening to the ears and the eyes
And they can watch if they want to
See it's gonna haunt you
The ghosts of the past come through so fast
You lay'em down but they can't, you try and put it in the trash
But it jumps out the garbage and still returns to be the hardest on the market
Lup

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Ay Rug
See these niggas already know what it is with me
I go hard in the paint
We ain't even got to talk about that
Philly in this bitch, heard that

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Rollie on my wrist brighter than my future is
Shorty standing there ass fatter than Rasputia is
I play for the dream team, hang out with the coolest kids
Watch out for my Louie belt cause that's right where my Ruger is
I go hard in the muthafuckin' paint nigga
Leave you stankin' nigga, what the fuck you thinkin' nigga?
Five presidents on that presidential Lincoln nigga
Gold presidential out the window middle finger nigga
Fuck 'em all that's how I feel
Shitting on these niggas without a deal
My money right I'm super strapped
Talking all that hammer shit where your toolie at
Ask around the town we be doing that
All that white and sour diesel we be moving that
That's word to my thirty-six O's
I'm still the same nigga with the thirty-six flow
In thirty days I'm trying to fuck thirty rich hoes
I'll still be spitting that flamerz like thirty-six stoves, woah
North side 'til the death of me, definitely
Camero with the black stripe, referee preferably
I be feeling myself and I ain't on no Ecstasy
But the groupies is and you can tell by how they molested me
She gon' suck my dick, she gon' suck it too
She gon' fuck Omelly, and she gon' fuck the crew
Now she fuck with me, she don't fuck with you
And that's crazy dawg you know that was your fucking boo
That's the reason why you hating
Let the streets say what they want because I'm caking
Shout out to all of the niggas that thought that I wouldn't make it
They the fakest ones hating while I was in the basement

[Verse 2: AR-ab]
Where I'm from getting money be the object
I get mine putting fire to the Pyrex
Fuck a diss track I bring it to you direct
I kill you then the witness die next
44 Bulldog is a 5x
You never progress if you only side bet
I'm trying to kill two birds with one stone
I just grabbed two birds but one gone
I supply it well that's my clientele
I fire shells if any one of my clients tell
They say its a long line to hell
But I'ma either get rich or I'ma die in jail
Until then I'm only trying to gain revenue
Razor blade in a plate full of residue
'96 Impala is heaven blue
Being broke like you is what I'll never do
Purple juice and them Xans got me sleep walking
She say niggas like me she don't see often
And I don't care if he shot I just keep sparking
I make niggas throw towels and make peace offerings
I got two baby mommas and we don't speak often
I just give them bank rolls and tell them keep walking
I just show a bitch money I don't keep talking
Then she slob on my knob like she retarded
Sour D 4 grams stuffed in the Dutch
Fifty grand rubber band tucked in the cut
Two bitches four hands touching my nuts
Then I give them long dick touching their gut
If money is the topic I get it like Floyd
I be OG, moving grams of the 

[?]
If I don't know niggas my hand on toy
Cause I'm a fucking shooter, Brandon Roy
My nigga Cass got the Bent I need the 550
I only blow good smoke the L's 550
You not a real connect if you can't supply fifty
My cousin Nas get half cause he'll die with me
O.B.H be the set and we gon' get ours'
A couple niggas got shot trying to take ours
I was in the crack house with eight vowels
You was like Eminem off of eight mile
In your shitty house writing rap songs
I use to run in niggas house with the mac on
I guess you only need one mic like Nas
I'll take a full pound in a white pie
Glock 30 compact that's the right size

[?] on the stove watch the white rise
I'm talking brick sales get your order up
I dry cook mine I don't like it watered up

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah, right here, or no, never mind
Pete Rock
Yeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
My cigarillo bigger than armadillos
I might go Schizo, pistol under the pillow
Abysmal, flow hot as fire and brimstone
Sonning these rappers, calling them kiddo, it's simple
I'm watching movies with the sound off
In the dark my shadow colder than a groundhog's
So I'm eating Chinese food with the brown sauce
Fuck bitches, nothing but a hound dog
Count off to a million, do you have time?
Blast off when you lifted, have you been this high?
Drifting by, give time a kiss goodbye
Cuz I'm gone, I'll be back as soon as pigs can fly
I'm the first time Peyton, let the pigskin fly
It is I, now that's Tony lifting
My shit is addicting, aliens are listening
Listen to this

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Why won't you let the rain clouds melt?
Let the rain clouds melt
Everybody let the rain clouds melt
Why don't you let the rain clouds melt?

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Back with Mac, yeah we mackin' right
Court-side looking brain-fried
Black and white guy, tie dye
Two hoes, tight thighs, no rolls on the ta-ta's
Pre-roll's in my Prada, neck gold, I'm your fa-sha
Son niggas, I'm the one, here I come
Where your tongue came from?
The underground like we platinum
Start the car with my right thumb
See me in the ride, Backwood burnin'
Get green, smoke earnin'
So high, spitting on the sky, the extraterrestrial's have arrived
Passports, we fly by, no court time
Throw the peace sign, by the Chevy as a Nissan
Now you acting like a pussy
Furtherize the level that we took 'em
Bent my dick in your mouth, I'll hush 'em

[Hook: Mac Miller]
Why won't you let the rain clouds melt?
Let the rain clouds melt
Everybody let the rain clouds melt
Why don't you let the rain clouds melt?

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Take you back with medieval, cerebral, assault retrieval
If you're trying to get down, better call your people
Flow like you're walking down a Harlem needle
Sharp as steeples, this is an assault on evil
An assault on evil
Said this is an assault on evil
So get on the mother fucking ground!

You know like high love, do you ever dream of
Candy-coated raindrops pourin' down high loves?
Ha, and I'm all about my gualas
Even though they say mo' money mo' problems
But I don't picture me goin' on no job hunt
Money pilin' up, now that's somethin' to be proud of
Ha, yeah, I'm killin' 'em, but it's not my fault
'Cause I've been on my grind, ha, Tony Hawk
And them rims is 28's, Marshall Faulk

I'm hotter than wasabi, bet-bet-better yet, Mojave
I'm all about my money so my cash never fold
They be like why you shittin' on 'em? 'Cause I'm a asshole
Everywhere I go, I be followed by six hoes
And my checks got a one, comma, followed by six O's
Women lie, men lie, go 'head, touch it
Money talk, if you ain't talkin' big bucks, hush it up
Duck 'cause I'm blowin' up
Pockets off that muscle milk, boy, they swole as fuck

Monday through Sunday, we rock different pairs
Feel me (Gangsta)
Gangsta Grillz, bastards

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I got a problem, I got the answer now
No more singin' chicks I'm messin' with a dancer now
She got a stripper pole, know how to break it down
She went from nothin' to somethin', she tryna make it now
She's original, I boosted up her style
She got her downtown pierced just to make me smile
We was finna go, but she naked now
And she did it in front of an audience

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shawty got ass
Skinny lil' waist, I ain't stupid, can't let it go to waste
Man, damn, she got swag
Temperature's heat, picture perfect every scene
Any camera flash
Go and try to get her, but when you do, she say that I'm with her
They ain't got the last, I'm chasin' with the mask
Tell me who's meaner when I switch 'em like sneakers

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And you know I never, never wear the same pair twice
I gotta keep 'em laced 'cause my tongue game nice
I rock 'em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal
Can't take nothin' from me 'cause I live that life
Never, never wear the same pair twice
I gotta keep 'em laced 'cause my tongue game nice
I rock 'em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal
Can't take nothin' from me 'cause I live that life

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I can't get rid of her, can't understand it now
I got the fresh girl, nigga, you got the hand-me-down
You got the sloppy seconds, already dug it out
I did my Dougie, sat down and let her work it out
She got them cakes out, I call her Betty Crock
Mr. Flintstone, I can make her bed rock
When I was tryna go, she got naked now
And shawty took it off in a DeLorean

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shawty got ass
Skinny lil' waist, I ain't stupid, can't let it go to waste
Man, damn, she got swag
Temperature's heat, picture perfect every scene
Any camera flash
Go and try to get her, but when you do, she say that I'm with her
They ain't got the last, I'm chasin' with the mask
Tell me who's meaner when I switch 'em like sneakers

[Chorus: Chris Brown, La the Darkman]
And you know I never, never wear the same pair twice
I gotta keep 'em laced 'cause my tongue game nice
I rock 'em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal
Can't take nothin' from me 'cause I live that life
Never, never wear the same pair twice
I gotta keep 'em laced 'cause my tongue game nice
I rock 'em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal
Can't take nothin' from me 'cause I live that life (Uh)
'Cause I treat them like shoes

[Verse 3: La the Darkman]
Whether Jordan 13's or Jordan D-Wade's (Uh)
With every new pair, my old pair feel played (Yeah)

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
I treat 'em like shoes, yeah, that's what I do

She gotta dunk, alley-oop
Nikes like ooh
Treat 'em all like shoes, treat 'em all like shoes

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Never, never wear the same pair twice
I gotta keep 'em laced 'cause my tongue game nice
I rock 'em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal
Can't take nothin' from me 'cause I live that life
Never, never wear the same pair twice
I gotta keep 'em laced 'cause my tongue game nice
I rock 'em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal
Can't take nothin' from me 'cause I live that life

But I don't mind if she take advantage of me
'Cause she got that bomb shit, I'm talkin' atomic

Shawty got some great aim, gotta keep her lookin' good
Man, she really had me hooked

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]

So is my lip gloss and my make-up
You can't say you cannot wait
Don't wanna escape, every time we do, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Your body is Heaven and it feels like home (Oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Someone took my emotions
Don't forgive me, I didn't ask
Someone took my emotions
I feel good 'cause I don't feel bad

[Verse 1]
You say that you gon' take my heart, bae
But I don't believe in fairytales
It's the same old thing, not a damn thing changed
You playing games, playing games
Now I'm taking names, taking names now
And I don't play no more, baby, this is game over

[Pre-Chorus]
Broke your heart so you could feel it
Think we're done, I think we're really through
Me and you (Oh, yeah)
Tears fall down, feels like it's raining
Sorrow, I can feel the pain in you
All in you (Someone took)

[Chorus]
Someone took my emotions
Don't forgive me, I didn't ask
Someone took my emotions
I feel good 'cause I don't feel bad

[Verse 2]
I've tried to give you all my time, bae
But that never meant a thing to you (Oh, yeah)
So don't you call my name, all my info changed
It's such a shame, what a shame
Now I'm breaking chains, breaking chains up
And I don't play no more, baby, this is game over

[Pre-Chorus]
Broke your heart so you could feel it
Think we're done, I think we're really through
Me and you (This is)
Tears fall down, feels like it's raining

Someone took my emotions
Don't forgive me, I didn't ask
Someone took my emotions
I feel good 'cause I don't feel bad

[Bridge]
All I ever wanted was your time
Right now, I don't even have the patience
I'm tired of waiting for you, I just wanna let go
You tryna change my mind but the answer's still no
Who are you?
You don't mean nothing, you ain't worth nothing
When I tell you something, you don't learn from it
I got my bags at the door, passport's a go
When I leave, you gon' come running
You did it, yeah, I got no feelings left
I'm so numb, you're so dumb
It's over, it's over

[Chorus]
Someone took my emotions
Someone took my emotions

[Outro]
Everything, everything I do
Ooh
Everything, everything I do

[Verse 1]
The man on your own
Why don't you put some bass in your tone?
Can't you see that it is lonely
Taking care of, all day long?
You're making me leave
Shouldn't have gave me a reason to breathe
Definitely not, no, that's not what I mean

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so done with pleasing you, I'm so over needing you
All this space just gave me room so I could fly
What I thought would make me die makes me feel like I'm alive
Boy, you words don't carry weight to hold me down

[Chorus]
I'm still so good over you
I'm still so good over you
Even if I didn't have a dollar in the bank
Even if you were my only way
I'm still so good over you
I'm still good

[Verse 2]
The man on your own
Why don't you put some bass in your tone?
Can't you see that it is lonely
Taking care of, all day long?
You're making me leave
Shouldn't have gave me a reason to breathe
Definitely not, no, that's not what I mean

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so done with pleasing you, I'm so over needing you
All this space just gave me room so I could fly
What I thought would make me die makes me feel like I'm alive
Boy, you words don't carry weight to hold me down

[Chorus]
I'm still so good over you
I'm still so good over you
Even if I didn't have a dollar in the bank
Even if you were my only way
I'm still so good over you
I'm still good
I'm still good
I'm still good

[Bridge]
I bet you think I need you
I'm telling you I don't, you lost your mind
I used to be so see-through
But now, I never let you on my mind
I'm worth a bunch of millions
But you be acting like your money's mine (Nice girl)
I'm on the Eiffel, chilling
I'll be damned if I let you blow my high
Baby, what you think about life
Without me by your side?
I bet you wanna get it right
But even if you get it right

[Chorus]
I'm still so good over you
I'm still so good over you
Even if I didn't have a dollar in the bank
Even if you were my only way
I'm still so good over you
I'm still good
I'm still good
I'm still good

[Verse 1]
If the day comes that you must leave
Let me be the ground to your feet
If the day comes that you feel weak
Let me be the armor you need

[Chorus 1]
Oh, if falling in love is a crime
And the price to pay is my life
Give me the sword, bring all the knives
Hand me the gun, I will not run
And when they spare everything but my pride
Don't you worry, boy, don't you cry
But when they ask who was the one
Who did you love?
Let it be me

[Verse 2]
If you ever meet your last breath
Let me be the last word you say
And if right comes, but you choose left
I will be the first to forgive

[Chorus 2]
Oh, if Heaven is a beautiful place
But those gates don't have enough space
And they lock you out, spare you no flame
I will come down there on my wings
And when the angels call me a fool
For giving all my grace up for you
I won't look back, but when they ask
Who did you love?
Let it be me

[Bridge]
Let it be me that you think of
When everything tells you to give it up
Let it be me that will anchor your soul

[Chorus 3]
Until the clouds fall out of the sky
And the snow falls down in July
Let it be me that you think of
Let it be me, the one that you love
Until the flowers don't bloom in May
And forever runs out of days
Let it be me, let it be me
The one that you love
Let it be me

[Outro]
Let it be me
Let it be me
Let it be me
Let it be me
Let it be me
Oh, let it be me

[Verse 1: Jack Mizrahi]
When you're vouging femme, femme, femme
Just to get those tens, tens, tens
You're the crème de la crème, crème, crème
I want you to stop, show 'em

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez & Jack Mizrahi]
Clap, bitches, clap

I wanna see legends, legends, legends, statements and stars, stars

[Verse 3: Jack Mizrahi & Jennifer Lopez]

'Cause here I come
Everybody wanna be a superstar, riding around in a rental car

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I wanna see runway

Eating the runway, serving the runway, marching the runway
Eat that runway
Eating the runway, serving the runway, marching the runway
Eat that runway, walk

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Jack Mizrahi]
Give me your heart, leave it out on the floor
(The icon Jennifer Lopez)
Tonight, you're perfect, you're living, you're so beautiful

Half of us came off a flight
We came together for this one night
I wanna see you leave it all on the floor
Girls get ready 'cause here I come

[Verse 3: Jack Mizrahi & w/ Jennifer Lopez ]
Mira, mira sen-señorita
Whether you're black or Puer-Puerto Rican
Mira, mira, ball-ball room nation
It's about fun, there's no segregation
Samba, merengue, ooh la la
I make you hot, make you hot, make you ha ha ha
Hip-hop, vogue and pop, lock and stop
Let it drop, let it drop, let it drop
Show 'em

Where my glam queens at?
Where my real queens at?
You want it, take it to the back
Where my sirens at?

Labels and pumps at
You want it, take it to the back
She don't want it

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Jack Mizrahi]
On the runway, where we don't play
I want it my way, don't be shady
(You can't take it, darling)
Be a lady, go crazy
On the runway, where we don't play
I want it my way, don't be shady
Be a lady, go crazy

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Jack Mizrahi]
Give me your heart, leave it out on the floor
Tonight, you're perfect, you're living, you're so beautiful
Tens across the board (Tens, tens, tens, tens, tens)
Half of us came off a flight
We came together for this one night
I wanna see you leave it all on the floor
Girls get ready 'cause here I come

[Intro: Choir of Downside School & Mac Miller]
(Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo)
What do you do? (Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo)
In April, I open my bill (Cuckoo, cuckoo)
In May﻿, I sing night and day (Cuckoo, cuckoo)
In June, I change my tune (Cuckoo, cuckoo)
In July, far far I fly (Cuckoo, cuckoo)
In August, away (Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo)
Yup (Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo)
Welcome (Cuckoo, cuckoo)
Have a seat (Cuckoo, cuckoo)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Uh, I'm still trapped inside my head, it kinda feel like it's a purgatory
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me
Think I'm livin' paradise, with what I have to worry 'bout?
Dealin' with these demons, feel the pressure, find the perfect style
Makin' sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs
I experience the touch of my epiphany in color form
Difference between love and war inform me, I'm above the norm
Give me anybody though, I'll gladly chew his face off, bath salts
Rhymin' like it's summertime on asphalt, hot
Haven't picked a major label, think I'm blackballed
Still don't got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls
Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?
I put this music 'gainst my life, I think I fear the choice
I don't know what I'm runnin' from, but I'm runnin' still
I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothin' real
I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel
So a hundred mil wouldn't make me sign a fuckin' deal
Money kills, that's the truth, it's called the root of evil
I want that Rolls-Royce that the homie Lennon drove (Woo, woo, woo)
So if they don't got some dollars for me, I'ma send 'em home
Unconventional, special, but unprofessional
Adolescent expression that's lettin' me meet these centerfolds (Centerfolds)
Troubles fill my mind capacity, I let 'em go (Let 'em go)
If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it snow (Let it snow)
That's just me all wildin' out and bein' extra though (Extra though)

[Interlude: Earl Sweatshirt]
Meezy, nigga, let 'em know (Let 'em know)
Here we go (Here we go)
Uh (Uh)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Uh (Uh)
And if God was a human, it'd be yours truly
Watchin' horror movies with some foreign groupies, thinkin' this decor suits me
Uh, I do drugs to get more loopy
I'm in tune to ancient jujitsu spirituals, it's blissful (it's blissful)
Lookin' out as far as eyes can see
I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet (Finally meet)
I think I'm JFK's final speech (Final speech)
Try assassinatin' all of my beliefs (My beliefs)
I'm asleep, so whisper to me for the peace of mind
And he be high, some weed to grind on top of Jesus shrine
Twenty thousand on my watch 'cause I needed time
If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine (Be divine)
Can't decide if you like all the fame
Three years ago to now, it's just not the same (Not the same)
Lookin' out the window, ashin' on the pane (Ashin' on the pane)
I wonder if I lost my way (Lost my way)

[Verse 1]
Break it, you buy it, nothing's for free
Especially my body, especially me
Break it, you bought it, I pray that you don't
Don't do what all guys do, do what all guys do

[Pre-Chorus]
First we're getting to be social then you're turning dishonest
Think that running the street's worth it
That just turns months into weeks into days
I ain't willing to be cordial, I'm just speaking to your conscience (Oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
You wanna take it but I won't give it away (Oh)
Leave me in a mess I never made (Oh)
Tryna play a game I never learned (Oh)
No one ever wins a love charade
You think that you're the only one to ever say
You love me when it's over

[Verse 2]
Break it, you buy it, this one's on me
Don't start a riot, don't cause a scene
Start up a fire, pray that you don't (Ooh, ooh)
Don't do what all guys do, do what all guys do

[Pre-Chorus]
First we're getting to be social then you're turning dishonest
Think that running the street's worth it
That just turns months into weeks into days
I ain't willing to be cordial, I'm just speaking to your conscience (Oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
You wanna take it but I won't give it away (Oh)
Leave me in a mess I never made (Oh)
Tryna play a game I never learned (Oh)
No one ever wins a love charade
You think that you're the only one to ever say
You love me when it's over

[Bridge]
You should've took your time
Did it right when you had me, baby
You should've took your time, should've took your time (When you had me, baby)
You should've took your time
Did it right when you had me, baby
But you was playing games, all those love charades

[Chorus]
You wanna take it but I won't give it away (Oh)
Leave me in a mess I never made (No)
Tryna play a game I never learned (Oh)
No one ever wins a love charade
You think that you're the only one to ever say
You love me when it's over

You squash it , man
It's a message , man
If you're hustlin' for fashion
Count on a nigga's pocket
Boy, you turned ... in the way
Holdin' the space,you're in the way
Boy, I swear you're in the way
Got a couple of homies in the pen,standing on their ...
You wait to squash space
Would you fuck niggas?
Yeah, you really fake
I'm afraid man
I swear you niggas in the way
Holdin' the space

Got shot 99 times in the face
You hurt you body in the play
And your head in the lane
We losin' breath in the rhythm
I swear the trick ain't grey
I got a million dollar play and it's covered the day
I get a medium memo feeds to tell them to get out of the way
I'm in the club, okay you are late
I'm like a red nose pit
You can't take shit off my plate
I take a cure for my niggas and I set it in your face
You want an R&B rapper, you better listen to Drake
If you're hustlin' for fashion
Count on a nigga's pocket
Boy, you turned ... in the way
Holdin' the space,you're in the way
Boy, I swear you're in the way
Got a couple of homies in the pen,standing on their ...
You wait to squash space
Would you fuck niggas?
Yeah, you're really fake
I'm afraid man
I swear you niggas in the way
Holdin' the space

How can I begin to fear
What all these suckers pretend?
Talk about what they're gettin'
And what they went on the weekend
Where do these niggas come from?
Holdin' space in the way
And all the real niggas are away
Can't take the pressure , gonna fall
When I was younger,I stood on my tip-toe
I got to go the long way
Wtf do you think I stand for?
Immitating a plant cause your lifestyle sucks
A nigga's money is to count on
You can't move for free
Anything has a price
If you're hustlin' for fashion
Count on a nigga's pocket
Boy, you turned ... in the way
Holdin' the space,you're in the way
Boy, I swear you're in the way
Got a couple of homies in the pen,standing on their ...
You wait to squash space
Would you fuck niggas?
Yeah, you're really fake
I'm afraid man
I swear you niggas in the way
Holdin' the space

You all niggas don't want no money
You're hustlin' for fashion
I'm in love with digital scales and some sandwich baggies
Catchin' me in and out
And I fly without no luggage
We sound like we're ballin' without no budge
We were running to the cars since I was a youngie
Momma told me that I wouldn't make it
You only got 2 options
Get up and take it
Nigga get that money, dont know why that smile in your face
And talk behind your back
If you're hustlin' for fashion
Count on a nigga's pocket
Boy, you turned ... in the way
Holdin' the space,you're in the way
Boy, I swear you're in the way
Got a couple of homies in the pen,standing on their ...
You wait to squash space
Would you fuck niggas?
Yeah, you're really fake
I'm afraid man
I swear you niggas in the way
Holdin' the space
Searching for the bad bitches
Smoking on a hope, start cross the long way
Then blow it like a zuca
Load and pass about the road way
Come and pass for friend Luca
Don’t get caught on the road talking
Fuck her banded ruffless
Spend on, fuck on, spend again your ruffless
Turn in fuck up in their ruffles
Truth fucks up in their ruffles
Fuck up in their ruffles
Downs in my pant came on to my Louie trip
I will catch no jail work, all they play you can afford
How’s magagy gain for
For you trapping then you suspect
Ball on my line cuz you ball on and on
Turn up what the fuck you mean
Time to go on time and get …ya all let it go
Lay it on the …caught that roaf pop pop
Send my truth shut shut get lose
Searching for a cause how will all succeed
Uuh go maley and blow free bones
...should maley on the air and stuck as coped
Stuck fronting, and fucking for the groupers do
Jording beating like a beast and they grope as dope
You all do it like you wre some boss
Certainly for it you can do the trick five
Cool for the load, now cool for the bone
Right G stop beat no religion getting for
Try fight, Louie stand on the blow
Say it’s full of bad bitches smoking on a hopa
Lord don’t pass me from the load call your ex friend luca
Don’t get caught on the road talking
Fuck her banded ruffless
Spend on, fuck on, spend again your ruffless
Turn in fuck up in their ruffles
Truth fucks up in their ruffles
Fuck up in their ruffles
Get more tag when you thought your nigga learn
If it ain’t bout no money then you really not concern
Cush is my colone I keep call anybody getting burn
Drop stick spin and weapon …spending like so much more
Me and my nigga neighbor will see you

Play with that cash
We stop now from breathing, we smoke the gas and all the hook
Self employ not security on my own shutter, stops in my head boy
From all the bitch…landing in the airport
Young nigga tolding the rugas
While I take the rufless shut you for get you like ruffless
In Vegas they find me on roof top
With groopies that make now a movement
Say it’s full of bad bitches smoking on a hopa
Lord don’t pass me from the load call your ex friend luca
Don’t get caught on the road talking
Fuck her banded ruffless
Spend on, fuck on, spend again your ruffless
Turn in fuck up in their ruffles
Truth fucks up in their ruffles
Fuck up in their ruffles

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I don’t give a damn about you, nigga
You a nobody!
Them young niggas with me that day
Scared of nobody!
Catch me in the hood showing love to the lowlife
Had the beast deal with you, I ain’t sparing nobody!
Keep that .45 on my hip, like a robot
1017, nigga, we ain’t scared of nobody
He ain’t got to wonder, we bring it cold, we show daddy
The young nigga .. like nobody!

[verse 1: Lil Duke]
First off, let me say, I got too many bitches
Second off, I don’t give a fuck about these niggas
MPA, Guwop, nigga, that’s a lot of money
DOG, we got street, that’s a lot of diamonds
I got 300 niggas with me scared of nobody
They could get the phone at molly, they’d shoot anybody
They’re so schizophrenic, shoot you dead because you panic
I got your bitch all at the mansion taking off her panties
You know we got it on us and it’s not a question (racks)
And like we’re having problems, then my niggas busting
We got .. to serve....

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I don’t give a damn about you, nigga
You a nobody!
Them young niggas with me that day
Scared of nobody!

Keep that .45 on my hip, like a robot
1017, nigga, we ain’t scared of nobody
He ain’t got to wonder, we bring it cold, we show daddy
The young nigga .. like nobody!

[Verse 2: Jose Guapo]
Shoot your closed ones, it’s not a pity sight
D-Boy called a pretty bitch to come and get me right
All ... hitting so hard, I don’t need a light
Street niggas from the hood, with a lot of stripes
Low questions, ass, cause we’re shooting first
I’m on the front of the line like they do to hers
I’m scrapped right now, and my homie got the rooger
I keep it with me like a DJ keep his computer
Same day, I’m on the first class to Bermuda
Money over bitches, I’m flying over shooters
Yeah, D-Boy, we’re moving in the lobby
Quit talking shit, nigga!
You’s a nobody!

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I don’t give a damn about you, nigga
You a nobody!
Them young niggas with me that day
Scared of nobody!
Catch me in the hood showing love to the lowlife
Had the beast deal with you, I ain’t sparing nobody!
Keep that .45 on my hip, like a robot
1017, nigga, we ain’t scared of nobody
He ain’t got to wonder, we bring it cold, we show daddy
The young nigga .. like nobody!

[verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Run around before your niggas and they’re on a fuckerie
A 100 K for head shots, they ain’t gonna bust for me
Green lights on their body, don’t bother to call
A hundred bags of OG, you think I ain’t gonna ball?
Shit! You think my coop ain’t tall
Panemara lost it all, oh
Fucking around with... got me signing on the wall
Everything that I do is getting life out of it all, yeah!
She’s seen me flexing on the floor, just know you can ride it all
I’m about to see my child ... building on...
Super-cool, but on my resume, I’m a dwag, I’m a dwag
Gucci do what he do, that’s my dwag, that’s my dwag!

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I don’t give a damn about you, nigga
You a nobody!
Them young niggas with me that day
Scared of nobody!
Catch me in the hood showing love to the lowlife
Had the beast deal with you, I ain’t sparing nobody!
Keep that .45 on my hip, like a robot
1017, nigga, we ain’t scared of nobody
He ain’t got to wonder, we bring it cold, we show daddy
The young nigga .. like nobody!
Fuck!
Yo

[Verse 1]
They be like your highness
Why you always buying' that fly shit?
Why you gotta check them tyrants?
And why you shut it down like hydrants?
Four door or five six
See what we get with that mind set
Now what's priceless?
When it's nice lenses on my iris
Need a high check for that white jet to my island
Why she gotta swag like a light bitch?
Why she gotta brag like a tight bitch?
Why she gotta act like a white bitch?
Cause I don't respond to your hype shit?
I think that you niggas might like this
Like, is the world for me?
Do you ever feel like that?
Like life is surreal but you gotta keep it real like that
Sometimes you gotta split real fast
Turn down these niggas that they heels go clack, clack, click, clack
He ain't had an ass, this, bad
Only if you bad then you more like Cat
We just stack we don't fold our cash
Doja you ain't a British bitch
Shit I just like British kids
Do you mind if I twist my hips and dutty wine on your bitches lips?
I'm cuntified and I killed this shit
I'm done let the DJ spin this hit
Yup, yup, yup

[Intro]
Ooh
You remind me, yeah
You remind me of such sweet memories

[Chorus]
I seen you before, baby
It's a déjà vu, honey
Don't you know that you remind me?
I seen you before, baby
It's a déjà vu, honey
Don't you know that you remind me?

[Verse 1]
You, you remind me of a love that I once knew
Is it a dream or is it déjà vu?
I just had to let you know so I had to sing it
'Cause for you, boy, I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
The way you walk and
The way you talk and
The way you move and
You remind me, yes, you do
Of the way you dress and
The way you dance and
You really like to groove it
You remind me
You remind me, yeah

[Chorus]
I seen you before, baby
It's a déjà vu, honey
Don't you know that you remind me?
I seen you before, baby
It's a déjà vu, honey
Don't you know that you remind me?

[Verse 2]
You, you remind me of a memory
And this is something you should know
Sweet baby darling, come on, just stop playing with my mind
'Cause for you, boy, I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
The way you walk and
The way you talk and
The way you move and
You remind me, yes, you do
Of the way you dress and
The way you dance and
You really like to groove it
You remind me
You remind me

[Chorus]
I seen you before, baby
It's a déjà vu, honey
Don't you know that you remind me?
I seen you before, baby
It's a déjà vu, honey
Don't you know that you remind me?

[Chorus]
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied

[Verse 1]
Love is made, made of many things
One of them is trust, but I can't trust you anymore
Things you say, followed by the things you do
They won't hurt me, no, they won't hurt me anymore

[Chorus]
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied

[Verse 2]
Love can make, make a stronger man
But you don't love me (You don't love me)
And I don't feel you're growing strong
The heart you break with your simple lies
You better watch out, baby, the next heart may be your own
I gave you my love, my life, my time
Mine was your own, though you stripped me to the bone
When I asked just how you feel, if our love was the deal
You said, "We got it goin' on," now I feel that love is gone

[Chorus]
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied

[Bridge]
I won't waste your time, 'cause I'm satisfied
I won't waste your time because I'm satisfied
I won't waste your time, 'cause I'm satisfied
I won't waste your time because I'm satisfied

I gave you my love, my heart, and soul
You took my love, now you want to take control
When a good thing comes your way
Why can't you stay?
I can't go on another day

[Chorus]
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied

[Outro]
You know I'm gonna be alright, you know I'm gonna be alright
You know I'm gonna be alright—Why? Why? Why?
You know I'm gonna be alright, you know that I'm satisfied
You know I'm gonna be alright

You don't have to worry—You don't have, you don't have to
You don't have to worry—You don't have, you don't have to
You don't have to worry—You don't have, you don't have to
You don't have to worry—You don't have, you don't have to

[Chorus (Repeat until end)]
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied

[Verse 1]
Ooh baby, not tonight
I don't wanna fuss and fight
I just wanna make it right
Ooh, there's work to do
I wanna get real close to you
I wanna get you in the mood

[Pre-Chorus]
All the things you want to do
Just relax and I'll take care of you
And anytime you want me
I'm sayin' that I love you every day
And I know that you love me, baby, admit it

[Chorus]
Give me all your love and don't stop
My love's waiting when you reach the top (All night long)
Come into my bedroom, honey
What I got will make you spend money (All night long)

[Verse 2]
You know that I know that you love me
So if you just give me a chance, I can still show you romance
I know that you're still savin' for my flavor, babe
So stop playin' hard to get, let's make love like we first met

[Pre-Chorus]
All the things you want to do
Just relax and I'll take care of you
And anytime you want me
I'm sayin' that I love you everyday
And I know that you love me, baby, admit it

[Chorus]
Give me all your love and don't stop
My love's waiting when you reach the top (All night long)
Come into my bedroom, honey
What I got will make you spend money (All night long)
And I say...

[Scatting]

[Chorus]
Give me all your love and don't stop
My love's waiting when you reach the top (All night long)
Come into my bedroom, honey
What I got will make you spend money (All night long)
Give me all your love and don't stop
My love's waiting when you reach the top (All night long)
Come into my bedroom, honey
What I got will make you spend money (All night long)

[Scatting]

[Chorus]
Come into my bedroom, honey
What I got will make you spend money (All night long)
Give me all your love and don't stop

[Verse 1]
Time on my hands
Since you've been away, boy
I ain't got no plans, no no no no
And the sound of the rain, against my windowpane
Is slowly, is slowly drivin' me insane, boy

[Chorus]
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
'Cause you ain't around, baby
My whole world's upside down

[Verse 2]
Sleep don't come easy
Boy, please believe me
Since you've been gone, everything's goin' wrong
Why'd you have to say, “Goodbye”?
Look what you've done to me
I can't stop these tears from fallin' from my eyes, ooh baby

[Chorus]
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
'Cause you ain't around, baby
My whole world's upside down

[Bridge]
Ooh, baby love
Goin' down, goin' down
Mmm, I'm goin' down
Ooh I, I

[Chorus]
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
'Cause you ain't around, baby
My whole world's upside down

[Verse 3]
Ooh, goin' down, goin' down
Oh, I don't know what to do
If I ever lose you, I'll be goin' down
I said, “I'll be goin' down”
Oh, please forgive me, baby
I'm so sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
What did I do wrong?
I said, “What did I do wrong?”
Please forgive me, baby, and come on home
Goin' down
Goin' down
Goin' down
Mmm

Here we are again, come on, ride into my heart

Oh boy, ooh reminisce, reminisce on the love we had

[Intro]
You are my everything
You are my everything
You, my everything
Everything, everything, everything

[Verse 1]
It's all because of you, I'm never sad and blue
You've brightened up my days in your own special way
Whenever you're around, I'm never feeling down
You are my trusted friend, on you I can depend
You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And when there were cloudy days you brought sunshine in my life
It never occurred to me the first time I saw your face
I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced

[Chorus]
You are my everything
Love so good only you can bring
You are my everything
You are everything and everything is you

[Verse 2]
My darling only you can make my dreams come true
And every night I pray, you'll never go away
I promise I will try until the day I die
To treat you like a king cause you are my everything
You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And when there were cloudy days you brought sunshine in my life
It never occurred to me the first time I saw your face
I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced

[Chorus]

You are everything and everything is you

When you're lovin' me, put your lovin' arms around me
When you're lovin' me, said I feel so safe, I find security
When you're lovin' me, forever I want you to hold me
My everything, my every, every, every, everything

[Chorus] + 

[Bridge] + 

[Chorus]
You are my everything
Love so good only you can bring

[Outro]
And I thank you, thank you, thank you

[Verse 1]
French vanilla ice cream
Just the way I like
Dripping on your windscreen
I can’t get a bite
Guess we could be more than friends
‘Cause this kiss won’t end
And you got me tremblin’

[Chorus]
You’re dynamite
I’m ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You’re dynamite
I’m ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you’re a wild thing
Rockin' on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you’re dynamite

[Verse 2]
Speedin' through the wasteland
Sparkling in the lights
Roll up to the boardwalk
Derelict delight
Eyes all on my dress again
I know how this ends
Boy, you’re all adrenaline

[Chorus]
You’re dynamite
I’m ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You’re dynamite
I’m ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you’re a wild thing
Rockin' on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you’re dynamite

[Bridge]
He’s not like other guys
I can’t apologize
For what my body wants
And what my heart decides
O-Ohh
‘Cause I’m so close to the real thing
Yeah, I’m so close to the real thing
I’m so close to the real thing
I could almost die

[Verse 4]
Say it isn’t over
Say it’s not goodnight
Maybe we could go somewhere
Start a pillow fight

[Chorus]
You’re dynamite
I’m ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You’re dynamite
I’m ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you’re a wild thing
Rockin' on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you’re dynamite
You’re dynamite
I’m ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You’re dynamite
I’m ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you’re a wild thing
Rockin' on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you’re dynamite

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I appreciate the finer things
Cut clarity, color up in my diamond rings
Million dollar wristwatch
Fresh as if I stepped out of a ziplock
Cause I feel women like trip knots
Now kick rock bop bop, lick shots in the air
I was a slumdog, who wants to be a millionaire?
Me nigga
Now it’s every day is a holiday
Dollar day, behind my mama eatin' at Benihana day
Chillin' wit yo mama day
She said the sex is smelling like teen spirit
Ain't nothing like a Nirvana day
Cobain, suicide doors on a race
Why does cocaine 2 by 4 run the plates
Means for two of yo cars I can buy one of mine
Son of mine, I still have money to drop the top in the summertime
I’m that nigga and you know that
Paparazzi shots, every moment is a Kodak
Throw it back, that’s what yo girl tryna do
She let me take off the dealy for a pair of Jimmy Choo
She like ODB style
Coming off the top of the dome like a freestyle
And I give it how she want it
And this ain't leased out but really bitch I own it

[Hook: Mack Wilds]
Tell me where you wanna go
What you wanna do
Said we living it like we own it
Own it, own it
Said I'm on top of the world
And what I need is you
Said we living it like we own it
Own it, own it, own it

[Verse 2: Mack Wilds]
Nothing's too much
Words that I live by
And that's just how I do
Do, I do
I'm young right now
But I won't be forever
So I'mma live it up like that's true
You might wanna roll with me too

[Pre-Hook: Mack Wilds]
Said I don't mean to brag
But I live a life that most can only dream about, yeah
So baby come be my dream girl
Pick a fantasy and let me work it out, yeah, oh yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mack Wilds]
Its never too much
So just let the drinks flow
Later on you can come through
Through, come through
You know you're the flyest
They should call you your highness
And call me king cause I'm that dude
All you gotta do is leave your crew

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Bridge: Mack Wilds]
What you talkin' bout?
We run this town
We got it sewn up
Because we own it
What you talkin' bout?
You deserve this crown
We got it sewn up
Because we own it
Because we own it

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Said the voice from afar
"Don't you know it doesn't have to be so hard?
Waiting for everyone else around to agree
Might take too long
Might take too long"

[Pre-Chorus]
"When, it won't be so hard" (It won't be so hard)
Well, it's true, yes, but you won't get far telling me

[Chorus]
That you are all you're meant to be
When the one from my dream
Is sitting right next to me
And I don't know what to do
Oh, alter ego

[Verse 2]
Get them to love you, while they may
Depending on your words and wealth
The only one who's really judging you is yourself
Nobody else
Nobody else

[Bridge]
If I could part

[Pre-Chorus]
It wouldn't be so hard (It won't be so hard)
Well, it's true, yes, but you won't get far telling me

[Chorus]
That you are all you're meant to be
When the one from my dream
Is sitting right next to me
And I don't know what to do
Oh, alter ego

[Hook]
Yellow diamonds, red cars (RG III)
My plug just sent a long bomb (RG III, RG III)
RG III, I’m on the run (RG III, RG III)
I’m a young nigga with plenty money
(RG III, RG III)

[Verse1: Gucci Mane]
Touchdown with it, RG III
Scramble with the work, nigga RG III
RG III in the trap with me, I’m the quarterback, nigga and I break down D
Get your 3D glasses ’cause I’m RG III
Already all PG 13
Drinking Louie XIII and watch ‘em train DC
And my whole team eatin’ I’m the MVP
Ran off on the plug, had to use my feet
Quarterback draw, got a strap on me
Never say that you got burners for me
All of my soldiers get dirty for me
4th and a inch, short by a brick
First we locked up but then Scooter got pinched
The pocket collapse cuz them niggas done blitzed
Double the profit, quadruple the risk
RG III, RG III
RG III, I’m RG III
Too quick, got a get rich quick scheme
Showtime getting close, rough bring the chain
Can’t carjack me like Bobby V
Got a RV full of nothing but RG III
In a drop head Rolls told my TOP
To RIP cuz I’m RG III
Dipped her in gold so she DIG
Ball in the streets like I play in the league
Fumbled the bitch could've passed her to me
Don’t go to the cops, I hold court in the street
Michael Vick money, I bury a beast
50 chains going, don’t cherish a piece
Got clean, I got glass, I got lean, I got swag
Ridin' through zone 6 bout to pick up a sack

[Hook x2]
Yellow diamonds, red cars (RG III)
My plug just sent a long bomb (RG III, RG III)
RG III, I’m on the run (RG III, RG III)
I’m a young nigga with plenty money
(RG III, RG III)
I, man, am Regal, a German am I
Never odd or even
If I had a Hi-Fi
Madam, I'm Adam
Too hot to hoot
No lemons no melon
Too bad I hid a boot
Lisa Bonet ate no basil
Warsaw was raw
Was it a car or a cat I saw?

Rise to vote, sir
Do geese see God?
Do nine men Interpret? Nine men I nod
Rats live on no evil star
Won't lovers revolt now?
Race fast safe car
Pa's a sap
Ma is as selfless as I am
May a moody baby doom a yam

[Harmonica Solo]

Ah Satan sees Natasha
No devil lived on
Lonely Tylenol
Not a banana baton
No X in Nixon
O stone, be not so
O Geronimo, no minor ego
"Naomi" I moan
A Toyota's a Toyota
A dog, a panic, in a pagoda

Oh no, Don Ho
Nurse, I spy gypsies, run!
Senile felines
Now I see bees, I won
UFO tofu
We panic in a pew
Oozy rat in a sanitary zoo
God, a red nugget, a fat egg under a dog
Go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog

[Hook: sample]
(Get what I'm saying? Forever!)

[Intro:]
Yeah! Kenny Parker in the background! (Forever)
Gimme a little more kick Kenny, Ima about to bounce it like this

[Verse 1: KRS-ONE]
Look! Look at him, look at them, look at her
What's about to occur, is what you prefer to occur
While these other rappers sloppily slur
KRS-ONE inspires you to be a street entrepreneur, (forever)
Cause I don't do dance lyrics, I do advanced lyrics
Organize frequencies that advance spirits
So try not to make the mistake again
Of hanging with fakes again
Then comparing them to the ones that created them, (forever)
You should never try to compare me
Unless its to that little kid being held by Holy Mother Mary
I'm a whole different kind of scary
Bring your military, I'll smash you and all your subsidiaries, (forever)
But am I, over your head, You like them others kid
You don't know that you're dead
Its easier, to pass the GED, The G-E-D
Than try to battle me?

[Verse 2: Channel live]
I'm down with BDP, you just down with O.P.P.,
I keep planets in orbit, you know, ODB
I'm from E.O., you just a slave to O-E
And you don't even know yourself, how the fuck you gonna know me, (forever)
Knowledge Reign Supreme, Hakim means the wise
But the best part is understanding forever, we will rise
But ya'll stay on ya knees, beggin' please don't squeeze
You thought it was chill to the undercovers that squeeze
Now you all fucked up, this rap zoo is just a tease
With little young niggas runnin' around, claim to be OG's
When they only just ice stuck at thirty-two degrees
And they ain't Just-Ice, Kool G Rap, or Ice-T, (forever)
Like the "T" in Terror Squad, we bring the terror hard
If Hip-Hop is a nation, BDP is the national guard
KRS the national god, and I'm like John the Baptist
I'll watch ya niggas up you even think to try to attack this (forever)

[Outro: KRS-ONE]
The one, thats wassup number one
Only zero comes before, and thats none
The beginning, you can survive with one lung
And even one kidney, no kidding
One, two, three, four, without one
Two, three, and four are no more, done
KRS The One...

[Hook: sample]
(Forever. Do you understand? Forever!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at my old hoes, say no no no no
Look at my old friends that used to be down and around
Look at you all now, could I be dumb?

[Chorus]
Oh no 'cause I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
Ridin' round town with these lame ass niggas
Oh, no no no, no
Sweatin' myself for these lame ass bitches
Oh, no no no, no
Fargo ridin' around in a drop top
I’m like I’m not, I’m not, I’m not, I'm not

[Verse 1]
I ain't talkin' 'bout you, no, this shit all 'bout you
Rumors, they all were true, they all were true
Hope it ain't all 'bout you
Hopin' they wrong, expect it from all but you
But I know you got old
I know you got old
I know what you got is cool
I just wish I knew, I just wish I knew

[Chorus]
Oh no 'cause I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
Ridin' round town with these lame ass niggas
Oh, no no no, no
Sweating myself for these lame ass bitches
Oh, no no no, no
Fargo ridin' around in a drop-top
I’m like I’m not, I’m not, I’m not, I'm not

[Verse 2]
I ain't talkin' 'bout us, no, this shit ain't 'bout us
No, this shit ain't 'bout trust, it ain't enough
If I do my thing in the club
If I do my thing don't judge, no no don't judge
'Cause you be out doin' your thing, don't you say you don't get around
Drop top, whippin' down Collins, don't ask why I'm all alone
Don't ask why I cannot trust these niggas
Both girls and guys they lie that's why I

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at my old hoes, say no no no no
Look at my old friends that used to be down and around
Look at you all now, could I be dumb?

[Chorus]
Oh no 'cause I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
Ridin' round town with these lame ass niggas
Oh, no no no, no
Sweating myself for these lame ass bitches
Oh, no no no, no
Fargo ridin' around in a drop-top
I’m like I’m not, I’m not, I’m not, I'm not

[Verse 1]
I was driving on the freeway in the fast lane
With a rabid wolverine in my underwear
When suddenly a guy behind me in the backseat
Popped right up and cupped his hands across my eyes
I guessed is it Uncle Frank? or Cousin Louie?
Is it Bob or Joe or Walter?
Could it be Bill or Jim? or Ed
Or Bernie or Steve?
I probably would have kept on guessing
But about that time we crashed into a truck
And as I'm laying bleeding there on the asphalt
Finally I recognize the face of my Hibachi dealer
Who takes off his prosthetic lips and tells me

[Chorus]
Everything you know is wrong
Black is white, up is down and short is long
And everything you thought
Was just so important doesn't matter
Everything you know is wrong
Just forget the words and sing along
All you need to understand is
Everything you know is wrong

[Verse 2]
I was walking to the kitchen for some Golden Grahams
When I accidentally stepped into an alternate dimension
And soon I was abducted by some aliens from space who kinda looked like Jamie Farr
They sucked out my internal organs
And they took some Polaroids
And said I was a darn good sport
And as a way of saying thank you
They offered to transport me
Back to any point in history that I would care to go
And so I had them send me back to last Thursday night
So I could pay my phone bill on time
Just then the floating disembodied head of Colonel Sanders started yelling

[Chorus]
Everything you know is wrong
Black is white, up is down and short is long
And everything you thought was just so important doesn't matter
Everything you know is wrong
Just forget the words and sing along
All you need to understand is
Everything you know is wrong

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I was just about to mail a letter to my evil twin
When I got a nasty paper cut
And well, to make a long story short
It got infected and I died
So now I'm up in heaven with Saint Peter by the pearly gates
And it's obvious he doesn't like the Nehru jacket that I'm wearing
He tells me that they've got a dress code
Well, he lets me into Heaven anyway
But I get the room next to the noisy ice machine for all eternity and
Every day he runs by screaming

[Chorus]
Everything you know is wrong
Up is down and short is long
And everything you used to think was so important
Doesn't really matter anymore
Because the simple fact remains that
Everything you know is wrong
Just forget the words and sing along
All you need to understand is that
Everything you know is wrong
Everything you know is wrong

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'ma ride it right, I'm gon take good care your body
You my girl and I ain't gon never tell nobody
I'ma ride it right, I'm gon take good care your body
I'ma ride it right, Imma do it slow, yeah

I won't tell nobody no

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Bitches want to fuck a Thug
Bitches want to be my girl
Bitches need to find their love
Bitches want to kill these sluts
Leaving Onyx, pocket full of Magic City money
Body perfect, thick, her hips look like a dummy
Far from worthless, chrome hearts specs got me looking real nerdy
When she leave from Thug world
No longer do she want a motherfucker earthling
Throw that pussy at the Thug, I might miss
Tryna hit it
I want it too bad, do what ever to get it
She don't care about no cash, make you feel small like a midget
Just like Shawty Lo, baby let's g-g-get it

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'ma ride it right, I'm gon take good care your body
You my girl and I ain't gon never tell nobody
I'ma ride it right, I'm gon take good care your body
I'ma ride it right, Imma do it slow, yeah

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I don’t row deep
No, I’m not a G but I do fly Gs
Them boys want Ms
Me, I wanna be, them boys wannabes
Don’t know they’re A, Bs and Cs
But they run around claiming Bs ad Cs
Be careful, baby, it’s contagious
Me, I’m immune to these haters
These boys give away money like they allergic to paper
I’mma bury the game, undertaker
Big baller, no, big balls, yeah
I put my money where my mouth is
Give me about five years
And I’mma build something for my grandkids’ grandkids
That’s why when I saw you I had to come over and let you know

[Hook: Drake]
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
‘Cause you’re a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
‘Cause you’re a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on, we’re going home
Just hold on, we’re going home
It’s hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we’re going home

[Bridge: Majid Jordan]
You’re the girl, you’re the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there’s something, baby
I think there’s something, baby
You’re the girl, you’re the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there’s something, baby
I think there’s something, baby

[Outro: Drake]
‘Cause you’re a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
‘Cause you’re a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on, we’re going home
Just hold on, we’re going home
It’s hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we’re going home
Okay, okay
Public service announcement
We're gonna have a Bricksquad survey
I am going to come with the question
First question!
Jay-Z is the greatest rapper alive?
Survey says...
That's a lie
Gucci Mane is not the hottest rapper in Atlanta?
Survey says...
That's a lie
Someone, somewhere, in someplace
Ran Gucci from a store, block or club?
That is also a lie and you are not telling the truth
Moving on, moving on...
It's the Burrprint 3, staring me!
Gucci Mane that's the leading actor!
Supported by my whole cast, Bricksquad!
Okay, a lot of you niggas are broke
Putting pennies together to buy a quarter
And I feel sorry for you

[Verse 1: Taio Cruz]
Take all the love we had
Give all the love in back
Burn all the words we had
But don't you dare, don't you dare come crawlin' back
Take everything you need
Take all the blood I bleed
Burn all this left of me
But don't you dare, don't you dare come crawlin' back

[Verse 2: Taio Cruz]
Go if you have to leave
Go where you have to be
Don't you feel 

[?] of me
Just don't you dare, don't you dare come crawlin' back
Do what you have to do
Do what is best for you
Go if you think it's cool
Just don't you dare, don't you dare come crawlin' back

[Verse 3: Taio Cruz]
Cuz I still believe in love
You gave it all back
So don't you come crawling here
Don't you dare come crawlin' back
Don't you dare come crawlin' back

They know a nigga black, they wanna Wesley Snipe me
But where I'm headin', man, it's less than likely
Ha, that's why I'm laughin' at you niggas from the kitchen

Oh yeah, and shout out my nigga, Jay, nigga

[Verse 1]
We float before the sea at dusk
In heavy mist, in glitter dust
I smile before I want to
I smile because you want to

We sip the wind through lips of lust
And out it comes, warm wisps of love
I smile because I want to
I smile because you want to

Put the flowers in your hair
Wrap your tendrils round my chest
I smile because I want to
I am your boy

[Chorus]
Shake my little soul for you now, toy
And I settle up into a world of noise
I’m a man of many tricks and tools and joy
With a battery of guilt on which to poise

[Verse 2]
Down by the shore, a funny foal
Who bit my wings and ate 'em whole
You left before I come to
You left before I come to

We took to hills into the trees
I hit my head and bit the leaves
You left before I come to
You left before I...

[Chorus]
Shake my little soul for you now, toy
And I settle up into a world of noise
I’m a man of many tricks and tools and joy
With a battery of guilt on which to poise

[Bridge]
Shanks of slate fall to the beach
Wrapped in life in ultra greens
Pools teem with tiny feet
And whorls of tired anemones

You left before I got to
You left before I got to
You left before I
You left before I...
Shook the flowers from your hair
Run to me and kiss my hands
I’m dead before I...
I’m dead before I...

[Chorus]
Shake my little soul for you now, toy
And I settle up into a world of noise
I’m a man of many tricks and tools and joy
With a battery of guilt on which to poise
Shake my little soul for you now, toy
And I settle up into a world of noise
I’m a man of many tricks and tools and toys
With a battery of guilt on which to poise

[Outro]
I smile because I want to
I smile because I want to
I smile because I want to
I smile because I want to
I smile because I want to
I smile because I want to
I smile because I want to
I smile because I want to

[verse 1]

They never told you anything
I'm not learning I'm just menacing
He knows to fix it cause he’s broke
And the one thing he hates to be is a joke

[Chorus]:

(beat picks up as Archy repeats the word “broke”)

[verse 2]

And oh, sorry love he spent all your money on the parking fee
And there goes last week's salary
When you find him down the local
And yet he charmed you with his vocal
I bet you didn’t expect to be sitting at home on your own
Waiting for the bell or the telephone
Cause now you spend your nights
Fighting the same old fights
And your only comfort was the tv
But not anymore ‘cause you can’t afford the license fee

[Chorus]:

(beat picks up as Archy repeats the word “broke”)

[verse 3]

And now we’re six feet under (?) from another government blunder
I wonder
Who’s next (?)
They call me lost in their tundra
I’ve only lost too much
And now they’ve turned all our money, into dust
And then the U.S., at least they got someone to trust
Cause i could not been under the crust
And i could not been to believe in
The city’s just grieving, kids just teething
I’m weaving through cars
I look at the night sky and i see no more stars
Just London scars
Just London scars

[Chorus]:

(beat picks up as Archy repeats the word “broke”)

[Verse 1]
Here’s to the one with the smoking stare
Running through my head with a bolo knife
Chopping up the threads made up from looms
Of love and blood and hate and some empty tunes

Eyes killer cold and black and bare
Freaky little tooth hanging solo
Sucking at the walls like a rolo now
Making a cocoon where my brain fits

[Chorus]
I wanna go back, I wanna go back
I wanna go back with a club and attack
I wanna take to my guns and break you
I gotta make my little foe take his own

[Chorus]
I wanna go back, I wanna go back
I wanna go back with a club and attack
I wanna take to my guns and break you
I gotta make my little foe take his own

[Verse 2]
I’m overgrown with a yellow mold
Just fizzing drones in a hollow dome
My funny nose dripping little groans
I’m so so cold in the marrow of my bones

I look at you as you take a snooze
Your skinny lips dripping rabid goo
I lift your chin and I grin at you
As you come to, man
I’m running round your head with a bolo knife

[Chorus 2]
I’m gonna go back, I’m gonna go back
I’m gonna go back to a face no more mask
I was in full bloom until I met you
I’m gonna shake my fetters, I’m breaking loose

[Chorus 2]
I’m gonna go back, I’m gonna go back
I’m gonna go back to a face no more mask
I was in full bloom until I met you
I’m gonna shake my fetters, I’m breaking loose

[Chorus 2]
I’m gonna go back, I’m gonna go back
I’m gonna go back to a face no more mask
I was in full bloom until I met you
I’m gonna shake my fetters, I’m breaking loose

[Verse 1]
"What’ll it be now, Mr. Mole?"
Whispers sloth in curls of smoke
"Take a back seat, or play pharaoh
Dance with me and shake your bones"

[Chorus]
Slow down, it’s a science
He’s been waiting to bring you down
Snake eyed with a sly smile
He can hold you and shake you child

[Verse 2]
Leopards laze each on plush pillows
Slender capes of red and chrome
Paperback dreams in their deep doze
Twitch their toes to black mambo

[Chorus]
Slow down, it’s a science
He’s been waiting to bring you down
Snake eyed with a sly smile
He can hold you and shake you child

[Verse 3]
"Wanna play cheat now?" says the sloth
A domino flush to his nose
Tickle that cheek and take your throne
Pump your veins with gushing gold

[Outro]
We can hold you

We can hold you

Went to cop five and my connect brought me ten of them
I gave him dab and told him I'll be back

[?]

[?]
I'm a trapper not a rapper, roger that

[Hook: Meek Mill]

[Verse 1]
Put your hand down, boy, welcome to my zoo
Put your head inside my big black wild, while
I can still help you
See the snake baboon, funky, chic and smooth
Honey, can you spy the divine ape-swine?
'Cause he can see you

[Chorus]
I’m a man, I’m a twisted fool
My hands are twisted too
Five fingers to black hooves
I’m a man, don’t spin me a lie
Got toes and I can smile
I’m crooked but upright

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I ever want is just a little love
I said in purrs under the palms
And all I ever want is breaking me apart
I said to the thing that I once was

[Chorus]
I’m a man, I’m a twisted fool
My hands are twisted too
Five fingers to black hooves
I’m a man, don’t spin me a lie
Got toes and I can smile
I’m crooked but upright

[Verse 2]
To the left now, boy, underneath the moon
By the thick tan sand and the tall thin grass
One more thing for you
See the distant flume in the sleepy dunes
Makes my nerves clench close and my bones go cold
When I see that room

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I ever want is just a little love
I said in purrs under the palms
And all I ever want is breaking me apart

[Chorus]
I’m a man, I’m a twisted fool
My hands are twisted too
Five fingers to black hooves
I’m a man don’t spin me a lie
Got toes and I can smile
I’m crooked but upright

[Verse 1]
Hi, my little naked man
I saw you there looking sad
Face so lost, petrified
Timid twitch in your wide eyes
My oh my, such strange supplies
Many spoons all in a pile
Did you bend ‘em with your mind?
Precious, precious, right right right

[Chorus]
Honey honey, don’t you cry
It’s a ruse, all these creatures are a lie
Funny bunny, it’s alright
I clap my hands, and they’re gone into the night

[Verse 2]
Wiggle toes on wicker braids
Hanging with their nails so frayed
Mini fruits, all bone dry
And a cape, black tie-dyed
I bet I can make you smile
In the pools of moonlight
Watch this little trick of mine
Say with me this tiny rhyme

[Chorus]
Honey honey, don’t you cry
It’s a ruse, all these creatures are a lie
Funny bunny, it’s alright
I clap my hands, and they’re gone into the night

[Outro]
Take my hand, take my hand, take my hand, take my hand
Take my hand, take my hand, take my hand, take my hand
Take my hand, take my hand, take my hand, take my hand
Take my hand, take my hand, take my hand, take my hand

Take my hand, take my hand, take my hand, take my hand
Take my hand, take my hand, take my hand, take my hand
Take my hand, take my hand, take my hand, take my hand
Take my hand, take my hand, take my hand, take my hand

[Verse 1]
Twee vole, go dig your hole
Squish squirmies in your nose
Tree hairs in your eyes
You smile so super quiet
Free air you sip on
A cave edge a black bowl
Breathe in deep and slow
As your own splash echoes

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't go, please, don't go, please
Don't go, please, don't go, please

[Chorus]
You can’t run, so you must hide
You won’t make it back this time
I sold your rope for a bucket
Of lemon peel, now suck it
So, my friend, our time is done
You and I could’ve had so much
With ropes for the bucket
Of luscious black gold nuggets, yeah

[Verse 2]
Oh vole, where did you go?
Dim lanterns held by groans
Of beasties sad and tired
Lost in the muck and
It’s all dank and gross
Slugs on shrooms bubble smoke
Through pipes and mondo rolls
Their fuzzy warbles drone

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby, please, don't go

[Chorus]
You can’t run, so you must hide
You won’t make it back this time
I sold your rope for a bucket
Of lemon peel, now suck it
So, my friend, our time is done
You and I could’ve had so much
With ropes for the bucket
Of luscious black gold nuggets

You can’t run, so you must hide
You won’t make it back this time
I sold your rope for a bucket
Of lemon peel, now suck it
So, my friend, our time is done
You and I could’ve had so much
With ropes for the bucket
Of luscious black gold nuggets, yeah

[Outro]
Don’t go

[Verse 1]
This old goat with beard of grey
He turns his leather gripped cane
Those times you clapped and called for quiet
They’ve come to hold you, ain’t that nice?
He packs a fat oom paul to
Jib and make home-baked perfume
Sips froth from soft, warm joe
Snug eiderdown bedclothes
You know, you know the way that I...

[Chorus]
Come on you hermit
You never fight back
Why don’t you play with bows and arrows?
Why don’t you dance like
You’re sick in your mind?
Why don’t you set your wings on fire?

[Verse 2]
You slick back that wiry mane
A neat tucked slice
Deep trees sleep on the dank lawn
And scratch the slate
You finger down that waxen line
Between your breasts
A squeaky pain upon each breath
The plumbers left
You know the way that I feel

[Chorus]
Come on you hermit
You never fight back
Why don’t you play with bows and arrows?
Why don’t you dance like
You’re sick in your mind?
Why don’t you set your wings on fire?

[Outro]
Come on you hermit
Why don’t you play nice?
Why don’t you toy with sex and violence?
Why don’t you stare back
Into my huge eye?
Why don’t you set my wings on fire?

[Verse 1]
I breathe air and sigh
Toucan sleeps and cries
I'm all armored up
I've got my old helmet on
Keeping out an eye
Puffing all my feathers up
One more little blow
One more tap and I collapse
Teetering on a toe
I feel that final poke

[Chorus]
Please, it's not okay
Oh, can't you feel your dirty face?
Oh, don't it leave that filthy taste?
Oh, when you squeeze that life untamed?

[Verse 2]
I free-fall real slow
I'm all drying out
Where my funny friends gone?
You're in paradise
Who gon' plant the flowers, huh?
Weak and worried
I shut my wild eyes
And crumble to a pile
Of dust and fertilise

[Chorus]
Please, it's not okay
Oh, can't you feel your dirty face?
Oh, don't it leave that filthy taste?
Oh, when you squeeze that life untamed?

[Bridge]
Take my hand and let us fall
Play with me and pass the ball
Take my hand and let us fall
Play with me and pass the ball
Take my hand and let us fall

[Outro]
I breathe air and sigh
You can't breathe without me

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Y'all niggas wanted me to go to jail right
Y'all wished the judge gave me a lot of years didn't y'all
Fucking haters

[Bridge: Meek Mill]
The wait is over bitch I'm back
Haters see my face and almost had a heart attack

[?]
Hottest in America ya I'm about to take it over

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Mr. Hottest in the United States
Swagger on a million my flow be on outer space

Eenie meenie miney moe knock them all out of the way
Hit that nigga Drake, call Wheezy up
My niggas move them birds too call Jeezey up
Ask them if they're playing ball see if they're cheap enough
Pac-Man of the rap game, trail them all eat 'em up
Get money play for gang green
And my niggas get it too we're on the same team
Had 100,000 fans when I was eighteen
That's why these haters want to see me die like Beijing

[Bridge: Meek Mill]
The wait is over bitch I'm back
Haters see my face and almost had a heart attack
When they arrested me they was all with that
But when they let me free they all went into cardiac

Cooked crack I'm about to bubble like I'm baking soda
Like I'm in the race but I'm chasing 

[?]
Hottest in America ya I'm about to take it over

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I was in the jail cell thinking about millions
Talking about the game and when I touch it I'mma kill them
Rapper keep an eye on your fans before I steal them
Cause in the end I'mma win you niggas just the pilgrims
Watch me, just wait 'til my shit drop
Be on a thousand tracks and never wait for a pit stop
I'm hard body shooting straight for the big shot
Audemar Piguet thirty piece for the wrist watch
Ya, somebody call Kiss cause he'll watch me kill the game and say he never say shit
I put on for my city, make sure we all rich
Open up the door and do some Biggie on some small shit

[Bridge: Meek Mill]
The wait is over bitch I'm back
Haters see my face and almost had a heart attack
When they arrested me they was all with that
But when they let me free they all went into cardiac

Cooked crack I'm about to bubble like I'm baking soda
Like I'm in the race but I'm chasing

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Where they do that not around here
Slide through your block on the Banshee first gear
Ya Pradas on my feet D squared
Lame ass niggas sitting back to the rear
Every time I look up them hoes trying to fuck
Every time I drop I give a rapper bad luck
Shucks, pull up on em, daddy's on drugs
Now they climb back 

[?]
What you want to do when I come through

[?] ass rappers I check them like one two
Ain't a bitch around my niggas run through
Either she fuck me then maybe she fuck you
In the VIP sipping on Rosé
Rose gold rollie same color 

[?]
Pockets guacamole don't be on me like you know me
I pull up in the spur I'm balling on them like Ginóbili
Swish, that's a bad bitch for three there
Haters say there looking for me they don't ever be there
Break these lizards down, get em in the club when we there
Swagger on a hundred introduce them to that D squared

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Chris]
Bring them all back no strings attached

Get over here where that ass belong
Let's fuck and listen to Usher baby, daddy's home
Mary Jane pass the strong

Keep that ass on top like a carry on
Then I hit it from the back, in that ass like a thong
Fuck all night, last 'til the morn
Baby girl get up shake that ass to the song
Champ, Patron in our section
To you haters I got a little suggestion
You try to blame the economy while you stressing
Most of y'all niggas was broke before the recession

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]

Shawtys hear the law from the door, get naked

[Hook]

[Outro: Meek Mill]
Throw your Rollies in the sky

Girl, quit playin', Juicy J can't be your man
No discussion, we’re strictly fuckin' then toss you with the band
She ratchet, Dirty Diana, doin' anythin' to get on that camera
Screenshot tryna get her Instagram up
On the internet gettin' niggas jammed up
Know your type, the only thing I'm spendin' with you is the night
Turn you on it and if the face lookin' right I might hit it twice
Drill the chick after the club and then I sent her back
Might as well work at Lids the way she give me cap
She throwin' that like a quarterback
Call me Warren Sapp, I tackle that
Hit me when I'm in your town, I'm smashin' that

Oh, cake, cake

[Chorus]
Baby, this might sound rude
I'm taken but I want you
And I don't wanna play by the book, no rules
They say you can't have cake and eat it too
But ain't that what you s'posed to do?
Ain't you s'posed to eat it too?
Ain't that what you s'posed to do?
Ain't I s'posed to eat it too if cake's on the menu?

Tell me baby, can you take my order?

[Verse 1]
Hey pretty lady
Give me some of that cake
I'd like to place an order, ooh, I just wanna taste

Once I blow the candles out, put it in my face
So tell me you gon' serve it up nice
The customer's always right, baby

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
If my girl found out you was on her side of the bed, she'll kill me
If your man found out I was on his side of the bed, he'll go HAM
If my girl found out you was wearing her robe, I'd probably go missing
If your man found out I was wearing his slippers, wait

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
I don't care about none of these niggas, none of these niggas
I don't care about none of these niggas, none of these niggas
I don't care about none of these niggas, none of these niggas
I don't care about nobody but you

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Girl, you so special
I don't mind being disrespectful
Girl, you so special
We're so disrespectful, oh
Girl, you can call my phone at four in the morning
Girl, you can ride shotgun every time I'm rolling
Girl, you can come with me to her favorite diner
She even took me home so I could meet her mama, disrespectful

[Verse 2: Mila J]
If my man found out you was using his rubbers I'd be dead
If your girl found out you was paying my rent, she would lose her head
If my man found out I was washing your drawers, he'd pull out the desert eagle
If your girl found out how good I was riding that, wait

[Pre-Chorus: Mila J]
I don't care about none of these bitches, none of these bitches
I don't care about none of these bitches, none of these bitches
I don't care about none of these bitches, none of these bitches
I don't care about nobody but you

[Chorus: Mila J]
Boy, you so special
I don't mind being disrespectful

Girl, you're special so I'll be disrespectful

Girl, you so special, you so special baby
I don't mind being disrespectful, girl, I don't mind

Disrespectful
Disrespectful

[Intro]
Yes, no, maybe
Yes, no, maybe

[Verse 1]
Remember when you used to love me before I even was me
The way you used to hug me, lick me, suck me, kiss me, fuck me
I spent a lot of money on you, I invest in your dreams
I ain't ever fronted on you, girl, you know what that means
It's all mine, all mine, all mine
She said it's all mine
But somehow I knew she was a liar, she was a liar
She's a liar, she's a liar
Am I tripping? Am I bugging?
Is it over? Tell me something
You don't call me no more, who you fucking?
Tell me what it is, tell me what I did

[Pre-Chorus]
Where you go? Are you coming home
Any time soon? Are you coming home
Any time soon? Don't do this to me baby
Yes, no, maybe, yes, no

[Chorus]
But I ain't really tripping if you ain't tryna come back
Fuck that, you can stay wherever you at
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes, no, maybe
I just wanna know, why you playing games with my heart?
Could've sworn that you swore, never change from the start
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes, no, maybe
I just wanna know, how you gon' try to out me?
Tell me where the fuck would you be without me?
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes, no, maybe
Don't do this to me, baby
Don't do this to me, baby
I just wanna know
Yes, no, maybe

[Verse 2]
I've been selfish, I can't help it
Whole lotta years, whole lotta tears
Bullshit that you dealt with
But you let me and you left me
I really think that I would've made you my girl some day
Oh, but how foolish am I to think that you'd have to wait?
Like you never had shit, like you ain't a bad bitch
That could get her ass kissed from a nigga mad rich
But I'm missing that lift, rolling up a spliff, girl, the way your tongue twist
Getting lifted, tripping off dumb shit, you the only one that could make me cum quick
You know, please tell me I love you, please tell me
I hope, please tell me he fucked up too

[Pre-Chorus]
Where you go? Are you coming home any time soon?
Are you coming home any time soon?
Don't do this to me, baby
Yes, no, maybe, yes, no

[Chorus]
But I ain't really tripping if you ain't tryna come back
Fuck that, you can stay wherever you at
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes, no, maybe
I just wanna know, why you playing games with my heart?
Could've sworn that you swore, never change from the start
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes, no, maybe
I just wanna know, how you gon' try to out me?
Tell me where the fuck would you be without me?
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes, no, maybe
Don't do this to me, baby
Don't do this to me, baby
I just wanna know
Yes, no
I just wanna know
Yes, no, maybe

[Bridge]
Seems like I'm having delusions
This cannot be our conclusion
Got it off saying I was done
But when you're in love with someone
You come running, running back
I'm running, running back

[Chorus]
But I ain't really tripping if you ain't tryna come back
Fuck that, you can stay wherever you at
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes, no, maybe
I just wanna know, why you playing games with my heart?
Could've sworn that you swore, never change from the start
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes, no, maybe
I just wanna know, how you gon' try to out me?
Tell me where the fuck would you be without me?
I'm sorry for talking crazy
Yes, no, maybe
Don't do this to me, baby
Don't do this to me, baby
Yes, no, how the fuck you gon' leave me here tripping?
Yes, no, I miss you, don't make me have to come and get you
Yes, no, yes, ye-yes no baby
Don't do this to me, baby, I'm going crazy
Don't do this to me, baby
Yes, no, maybe
Baby, baby

Quarter ounces, half ounces, what you need, man
11th grade, made my way up to a P, man
And sent it back if I ever seen a seed, man

You gon' need some new lungs, roll me up a blunt-a-thon
While I'm smoking out the bong getting sucked like a thumb
Boy I’m in a daze, tangerine haze
I smoke so much KK they should've called it Juicy J
Bombay and lemonade, weed get the lemon taste
Never hit the bong, let me demonstrate

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
Go and roll it, chief and choking, marijuana, reefer smoking
Tried to sell me some under reggie, foot up in his colon
Call the doctor, call the clinic, bullshit we staying with
Your life ain't worth a motherfuckin' quarter but you payin' with it
Khalifa kush a hundred pounds, that's a half a mil
Memphis streets so eat this like a baby, like Enfamil
Lungs full of KK, have your mind on a runway
Blow my high, motherfucker, I'mma shoot up like an AK

[Verse 4: Juicy J & Project Pat]
My white house higher than Willie Nelson
On dabs the wax is melting
These clouds are smoking, help me, I'm flying like Elroy Jetson
I might bring a dispensary down in Tennessee
Whole pounds of granddaddy, but he ain't no kin to me
I’m staying with the greens, like collard

[Verse 2: Peedi Crakk]
Aww yes
Fuck around lay around
Play around watch the waiter boy lay it down
You the best say it now I don't think so
Don't let the pride weigh you down you gon' sink slow
Checking my fresh you should be checking bank rolls
Why should I stress my check is in the bank yo

[?] blowing in the wind through the window
I'm really that nigga to fuck without a tempo
I'm in a sauna climbing a llama
My baby momma trying to figure out if I'm in some drama
I'm sleeping on top of the covers
Locks on the shutter
I'm going through she wondering why won't I fuck her
I'm getting 

[?]
Candy painted the Lac black jelly bean
Black hoodies and skullys wiggles in the cellophane
Roll up puff and pass it
Tuck the ratchet

[?]
Five be in your area
War be at your front door causing mass hysteria
Ring Peedi in your mother's house
Second floor back room trying to check your brother out
Blow 

[?]
Chilling in your drive way peeling out pronto
Skrrrr first we grip CL
Straight to the condo everything DL

[Verse 3: Shizz Nitty]
When I get my tag on I put that mask on
Still ride or die 

[?] drag on
Used to run it in plenty grams it would add on
Drake shit best had 40 in my jet lag
You just know you're rolling play your part just like a step dad
Pace him with a glizzy got a shot like Travis Bess had
Don't worry if that tec jam up
I will run up on the groom then hit the best man up
See I put that on my glizzy I'll get them all touched
Them niggas come in packs then we hit them all up
See my youngin had a dream with a bird in it
SK shoot had the curb chipping
Diesel and the syrup sipping

[?] had the hood in the frenzy

[?] at the shootouts good with the semi
Out of town make a presence when I'm not around
There's no cause they clip up and ride around
My nigga Doc be at your mom crib
My nigga Wiz be at your mom crib
That nigga Snoop be at your mom crib
Neighbors looking like what the fuck did your mom did
With that Parabellum nine hollows let them all go
Run this shit like Marlow
Spark that man like Waldo

[Intro: Peedi Crakk]
Meek Mill and Crakk-daddy (Daddy), the heat is automatic (Matic)
Somebody tell— (Jahlil Beats, holla at me!)

[Verse 1: Peedi Crack]
I’m a trooper, and everything I ride’s super
And my producer, that nigga just flew in from the future
And I’m loose off Goose, I’m 'bout to get looser
And you could catch me in Bermuda, moving with a shooter
I’m ready, like Freddy, the fetti, roll heavy
And every 13th of January, they in kiddy city blowing monkey
Keep it funky; when my pockets was bony, I was lonely
But now they husky, I’m hitting groupies only
Thank you, I came through the venue to entertain you
A shame, I had to bring the banger 'case I got to bang you
It ain’t too many MCs speaking my lingo
I change so frequent that the flow can’t keep a main ho
I came for paper, forty acres, and Jamaica
Make a lot of noise and take a lot of sedatives
Ain’t nothing greater, haters play the back of the theater
Players, take a bow, flavor by the mile (Rrr-ing!)

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I ain’t with that "He say, she say" shit (Yeah)
Unless he say she say she on my dick (On my)
Yeah, I hear 'em haters talking, but they on my dick (On my)
I shine like the diamonds all on my wrist
She say, "Leggo, Leggo, Leggo"
I tell them haters, "Leggo, Leggo, Leggo"
I tell them bitches, "Leggo, Leggo, Leggo" (Woo)
I tell them bitches, "Leggo, Leggo, Leggo"
Um—

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
First of all, my flavor on "ridiculous" (Yeah)
D-Square, kicking it, Benji after Benjamins (Benji)
Every time I meet 'em, they be sweeter than some cinnamon (Sweet)
'Cause they know I’m getting it, so they let me swim in it (Ha)
I eat your pussy if it smell like water
You can say "Fuck me," but don’t fuck my daughter
I ain’t even got one yet, they putting in an order (Ha)
Tryna get me to hit it raw so they can child-support her
Slaughter, rawer than the coke 'cross the border
SS Camaro looking like a Transformer (Skrt!)
You'll catch me in it, dipping, like I’m de la Hoya (Ha)
Better yet, Mayweather, 'cause I’m way better
And I don’t save cheddar (Never)
I blow it like candles on my birthday
Shawty thirsty
She grabbing on and sucking like she tryna hurt me
I call Omelly, we go party on a Thursday, leggo—

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I ain’t with that "He say, she say" shit (Yeah)
Unless he say she say she on my dick (On my)
Yeah, I hear 'em haters talking, but they on my dick (On my)
I shine like the diamonds all on my wrist
She say, "Leggo, Leggo, Leggo"
I tell them haters, "Leggo, Leggo, Leggo"
I tell them bitches, "Leggo, Leggo, Leggo"
I tell them bitches, "Leggo, Leggo, Leggo"
Um— (Ugh)

[Verse 3: Young Chris]
Hundred thousand dollars' worth of diamonds, I be shining
And that nine that I be palming fitting fine up in the lining (Ugh)
Fresh Ferragamos every time when I'm
Sitting higher while they climbing, I don’t lie when I be rhyming (Woo)
Gucci or Vuitton-ing (Ugh), twenty-ten signing (Yeah)
Drop the fourth quarter, Mike Brown putting 'Bron in (Swish)
Nigga, where your cash at? Your plastic declining
Fresher, check out my dresser, fashion designing (Ugh, ugh)
Clean-cut; coupe, cream guts (Guts)
Slight tint OZ or fruity, the steam up (Tss)
See me, get cracked, hog the scene up
Three franchises like Boston teamed up (Have you seen us?)
But this is Philadelph', we did it all (Ah)
You got to load the hitter soft; she got it in; we get it all
We don’t even listen to your wack rap, nigga (Nah)
Twenty-ten edition of that Rat Pack, nigga (Yeah, yeah)

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I ain’t with that "He say, she say" shit (Yeah)
Unless he say she say she on my dick (On my)
Yeah, I hear 'em haters talking, but they on my dick (On my)
I shine like the diamonds all on my wrist
She say, "Leggo, Leggo, Leggo"
I tell them haters, "Leggo, Leggo, Leggo"
I tell them bitches, "Leggo, Leggo, Leggo"
I tell them bitches, "Leggo, Leggo, Leggo"
Um—

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Uh, The Ill Spoken
2008 shit
Hahaha, we had to take it back
B.DuBB and Easy Mac, haha

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Life changed since the old days, how it all used to be
The buffoonery, and dreams of buyin' jewelry
The class can't learn 'til a student teach
I gave a lecture, wrote a stupid speech
Back in the days, The Ill Spoken ridin' ATV's
Performin' on TV there at JPB
It was four years ago, seemed like so long
In the attic smokin', comin' up with dope songs
Never knew I'd be a star back then
I was tryin' to get money for a car back then
I just wanted to record back then
Never had a lot to do, we was bored back then
All them days at the Shadow Lounge, sellin' tickets, gettin' shows
We was tryna tell the world we was the next to blow
Even beef with some dudes up in Canada
Had a little battle, spit our bars in the camera
We stayed up late makin' mixtapes
That we gave out tryin' to get our name out
Doin' shows, no one knew us
They would boo us, knew that when we grew up
They'd be askin' for a verse I'm blowin' back Dutches
Still got love for my dudes on rap mullet
Man that grind was tough, we wasn't gettin' far
Still rolled up to shows with more cars than people in attendance
Most of the people, they were people we was friends with
The best shit but, it got expensive when we couldn't sell tickets
Wasn't doin' much but tryin' to be the illest
At your crib smokin' weed and raps
Grindin' hard, 'cause music, we believed in that
We had some differences, yes, but for real we've been blessed
You the homie, man, I wish you the best

[Chorus: Samples, Mac Miller & Beedie]
Paid dues, we gon' make y'all feel this
Kiss lips and spit the real
I remember way, way back in the days
Every aspect is vivid (The Ill Spoken)
Paid dues, we gon' make y'all feel this
Kiss lips and spit the real (Yuh)
Drop flows that is hot fa'sho (Ill Spoken)
I never thought that we would make it up this far (Yeah, Beedie)

[Verse 2: Beedie]
Life a times, that we recharge
Fresh out the weed jar, run that bih like a seesaw (Haha)
Been three years since we dropped a song
Got me thinkin' 'bout them days that we talkin' on
Stayin' up hella late 'til we passin' out
Just tryna face a 8th, Jimmy, pass the loud
At my mom's house, Point Breeze north south
Circle room smokin', yo, we blow the back porch out
Mac was still in high school while I was at the day job
Afterward, we lingered for, attracted to the stage, y'all
Most them cats hatin' too, face who wanna face off
Stories like "Ayy, sup"
Boy, I'll tear your face off
From a fantasy your gettin' on
We had the Talent and Drive, like we just can't go wrong
Can't forget our first video, from any raw
Quality was really raw
But them kids was really hard (Word)
We made it catchy, like we blockin' Gretzky
Nowadays you couldn't miss me like the cost is risky
Dreams turn to business, business turn to paper
Turn the pages of the book and watch us turn to somethin' major
And always puttin' labor, even if they try to label us
With elements to change the game, call the labels up
And we was naive probably got soy loadin' up business for the quality
From freestylin' with Niels to watching you up on TV
Studyin' how it be though
You my mans, seen a real up and down the starter
Second hand give me unique perspective on it
And when you signed with Rostrum
Made me realize this shit was real and I ain't lost
No bridge that I ain't crossin'
And we some kings, I'm mom's Capricorn
'Til the castle gone, we Ill Spoken

[Chorus: Samples & Mac Miller]
Paid dues, we gon' make y'all feel this
Kiss lips and spit the real
I remember way,way back in the days
Every aspect is vivid (The Ill Spoken)
Paid dues, we gon' make y'all feel this
Kiss lips and spit the real (Yuh)
Drop flows that is hot fa'sho (Ill Spoken)
I never thought that we would make it up this far

[Intro]
Yeah
Mmm

[Verse 1]
And there she goes
She's sitting real nice with her head full of advice from friends
She walks around
She tries to rearrange but everything goes under her bed

[Verse 2]
And it's countless
She's got a jar full of change saved up for vacation
And she's watching
She's watching her sons growing up just like their mom
And it's hard for her

[Chorus]
And I said, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
You gotta start lifting your head up, head up, head up
And I said, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
I know it's hard, but you gotta get outta bed, outta bed, outta bed

[Bridge]
Yeah, she don't know what to do
She's got everything and nothing to lose
She's got a call from a guy just seeing if she's alright
(Better not panic, better not panic, better not panic)

[Verse 3]
She's got a face full of tears held back by the strength of five
Mmm
And she says, "Happiness ain't free
Everybody fights just like me
But I've given up the ability to retreat"

[Chorus]
And I said, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
You gotta start lifting your head up, head up, head up
And I said, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
I know it's hard, but you gotta get outta bed, outta bed, outta bed

[Bridge]
Yeah, she don't know what to do
She's got everything and nothing to lose

[Verse 4]
Yeah, there's time for us to figure it out
I'm there, so don't be scared
There's time for us to figure it out
Don't be, don't be scared

[Outro]
(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
All alone, rest your head (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
On my lap when you're down (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
All alone, rest your head on my lap (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby) When you're down
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
Ooh, Ruby, don't cry (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby) 'Cause I am here, and I am here
(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby) So don't you cry, 'cause it'll be alright

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I can't wait to take you home
I've been waiting all day to heat you up
Cover you in butter
Then I'ma drown you in syrup
Go (HEY!)

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator and Kali Uchis]
I'm gonna eat you alive
I'm gonna eat you alive
Woah, you and I
(Come one baby)
I'm gonna eat you alive
Now you're gone
Eat you alive
I'm gonna eat you alive
Gone, gone, gone
You're already gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone
And I'm gone
And I'm gone

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Aunt Wang will be my favorite forever
I eat it, I drink it, I breathe it
I’m down for whatever
You fuck with that bullshit
But I know that Aunt Wang’s is better

[Intro]
Yeeeaaah, bitch!
Wolfgang
Sweatshirt-uh, ho!
Bitch!

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Pigeon workers leave the studio wall shitted-up
Shit talkin' little fuck, getcha' sista-sister fucked
Shit, I hit stripper up we gone pickin' nigga-niggas
Stick inside the fuckin' pops, worried, glue them bitches up

Rippin' writtens while my nigga splittin'-splittin' blunts
Eyes hazey wit' my middle finger up a stripper's cunt
Lights down, lit her up, sherm in my sippy cup
Ice pickin' cripples 'till I get my pickle rub

Catch me-catch me poppin' pimples tellin' bitch's triple sixes
Stab-stabbing them with pencils in their temples 'till my dick erupts
It's really fuckin' simple, slut, Wolfgang, get with us
We about to grab a FULL fista' nuts and lick 'em up
Turn it up, fisticuff, givin'-gi-givin' bitches dick to suck
Let 'em drink the cum out a fuckin'-fuckin' paper cup
Whore's wider than the horse that I'm sniffin' up
Leave now if you ain't tryin' get them titties touched

[Intro: Pitbull]
Mr. Worldwide
Across the world
Let's ride, Dale

[Verse 1: Nick]
I wake up every morning and see your face
Lying right beside me it fills the space
In my heart, I can't live without you
Don't wanna figure right how to
And every time I lay my head down to sleep
The emptiness inside of me starts to beat
So loud, I can't hear the sound
Do you hear it? For you

[Chorus: All]
I fall in love all over again
Each time I lay my eyes on you, I pretend
I feel so helpless, without you
Feel so helpless, without you
It takes a piece of me each time you leave
I feel it in my chest, so hard to breathe
I feel so helpless, without you
Feel so helpless, without you

[Verse 2: Howie]
I witness every trick you got up your sleeve
But still somehow you keep on surprising me
I'm yours, I can't live without you
Don't wanna figure right how to
Every time I see you, I feel like I
Could be the luckiest man in the world
Why try to fight it?
There's no need to hide it, because, you know

[Chorus: All]
I fall in love all over again
Each time I lay my eyes on you, I pretend
I feel so helpless, without you
Feel so helpless, without you
It takes a piece of me each time you leave
I feel it in my chest, so hard to breathe
I feel so helpless, without you
Feel so helpless, without you

[Bridge: AJ]
Oh, feels like I, fall apart
Every time, where do I start?
(Without you)
I'm so helpless without you
Without you, yeah

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Every time I close my eyes
You're the first thing that runs to my mind
Everywhere I go, I see you, hear you, feel you
I just wanna be near you and heal you
Last thing you said is, "How dare you"
First thing I said is, "I'm sorry"
Now I'm sitting here helpless, man; same old story
Now she's brokenhearted, time heals all the wounds
She said, "Not this time", it's true, everyone plays a fool
And that fool is me, because I foolishly
Took advantage of a woman who loved me

[Chorus: All]
I fall in love all over again
Each time I lay my eyes on you, I pretend
I feel so helpless, without you
Feel so helpless, without you
It takes a piece of me each time you leave
I feel it in my chest, so hard to breathe
I feel so helpless, without you
Feel so helpless, without you

[Verse 1]
Baby, I'ma be straight up, don’t waste no time
I know you ain't my, you ain't my baby
Do you think about us?
Do I cross your mind anytime?

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that you, you’re taken
It’ll never change 'cause it’s always been that way
But you know that you can’t fake it
He can’t give you what I got here right now
Girl, I know what you want
No phones, we ain’t even gotta talk
Next time that he leave you all alone
I’m gon’ come through, replace him
I’m gon' watch you get naked
I’m gon' tell you, girl, take it
Next time that he leave you all alone
I’ll give you all the love he did not, I’m about to take his spot

[Chorus]
Let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back
So let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back, back

[Verse 2]
Baby, let me tell you what’s up
I don’t trust that nigga, fuck that nigga, stop bringing him up
Baby, I ain't never gave no fucks
One fuck’s too much, unless you’re talking about us

[Pre-Chorus]
But, I know that you, you’re taken
It’ll never change 'cause it’s always been that way
But you know that you can’t fake it
He can’t give you what I got here right now
Girl, I know what you want
No phones, we ain’t even gotta talk
Next time that he leave you all alone
I’m gon’ come through, replace him
I’m gon' watch you get naked
I’m gon' tell you, girl, take it
Next time that he leave you all alone
I’ll give you all the love he not
I’m about to take his spot

[Chorus]
Let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back
So let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back
I’m back

[Outro]
I’m back
I'mma watch you get naked
I'mma tell you to take it
Let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back
So let your man know that
Mr. Steal Your Girl is back (is back)
I’m back…

[Verse 1]
Just me, top down, on the way to the beach
Four bad chicks in the middle of the street
Roll right up and they all hopped in
Now we in the sand havin' lunch on me
Told the girl, "Don't let your feet get wet
We about to grab some drinks and head to my condo, you can be my weekend guest", oh
I'm in her head so I know we're 'bout to get started
One thing led to the next, now she got her hands all over my body, eh

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't tryna stop and I know she with it
I can see it in her eyes, she been down from the beginning
And she can't leave me alone 'cause I drive her body crazy
I done gave her a little taste now she wanna have my babies

[Chorus]
Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
Got three bad friends and they all on me
Now me and baby girl been chilling all week
And all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
That's all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
All we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
And all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep

[Verse 2]
Now we on the balcony chillin'
She lovin' the view when we smoke, I'm lovin' it too while I stroke
Got the stars looking down on us, do it 'til the sunrise up
Beat, beat, beat, take a drink, go to sleep, she a freak, she can get it right up, get it right up
Man shorty like the Energizer
She just wanna ride, she ain't never tired
She cookin' naked, eggs and some bacon
After I eat that, I treat that, then eat that again, and again, and again

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't tryna stop and I know she with it
I can see it in her eyes, she been down from the beginning
And she can't leave me alone 'cause I drive her body crazy
I done gave her a little taste now she wanna have my babies

[Chorus]
Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
Got three bad friends and they all on me
Now me and baby girl been chilling all week
And all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
That's all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
All we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
And all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep

[Bridge]
Posted up in that 305, yeah you know it's just me and my freak
All we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
Posted up in that 305, yeah you know it's just me and my freak
All we do is fuck, drink, and sleep

[Chorus]
Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
Got three bad friends and they all on me
Now me and baby girl been chilling all week
And all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
That's all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
All we do is fuck, drink, and sleep
Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
And all we do is fuck, drink, and sleep

[Verse 1]
She giving me the side eye
Saying she ain't staying over here
Each and every time I let her down
Like I didn't care

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess I got used to hearing whatever I wanted to hear
I guess I got used to feeling, like you supposed to give it here
She said she thought I was different, but now she could see it clear
Said she ain't got nothing good to say so she ain't gon' say nothing, but this

[Chorus 1]
You ain't shit, you ain't shit
You ain't shit
Said she ain't got nothing good to say so she ain't gon' say nothing, but this
You ain't shit

[Verse 2]
Guess she don't want me to hit her up no more
Guess she don't want me to beat it down no more
Maybe she's right when she's like, there's plenty girls I can call
Boy, ain't you tired of this life, don't you ever get bored?

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess I got used to hearing whatever I wanted to hear
Guess I got used to feeling, like you supposed to give it here
She said she thought I was different, but now she could see it clear
Said she ain't got nothing good to say so she ain't gon say nothing, but this

[Chorus 2]
You ain't shit, that's what she said to me
Looked me dead in the eyes and said, "You ain't shit"
Said she ain't got nothing good to say so she ain't gon' say nothing, but this
"You ain't shit"

[Verse 3]
Half the man that you think you are, no you ain't
Nothing like all the songs you sing, I hope you change
No better than my ex, other than the sex that I'm never will forget but it's on to the next
And I know you gonna regret when I'm gone, nigga yes, you ain't even took me shopping yet
Hold up, you saying I ain't shit?
Would you even be here with me here, yeah, if I wasn't rich?
We can talk about your ex 'cause you was cheating on him with me
And we can talk about the sex 'cause that's all it'll ever be
And you’re no little angel girl are you?
You're not a good girl, but you try hard to be
Said she ain't got nothing good to say
So she ain't gon' say nothing, but this

[Chorus 3]
You ain't shit, that's what she said to me
You ain't shit, that's what she said to me, you ain't shit
Said she ain't got nothing good to say so she ain't gon' say nothing, but this
You ain't shit, you ain't shit

[Interlude]
That's how you feel?
Damn, no it's cool, you know
It's too late for all this bullshit
You come here and you know what time it is and now you get all emotional

[Verse 4]
Now you know you've been drinking
What are you thinking?
Hey don't you hop behind that wheel girl, not tonight
You shouldn't drive, you drunk
I won't tell no lies, girl, you hurt my pride
You know you gotta give me them keys, come back inside
It ain't even that deep, why you tripping on me?
We can take it back a couple of weeks, you was just a homie
What's your problem? I check up, I check up, I check up on you like a doctor
We roll up, we smoke up, we roll up, we smoke up like rastas
And I keep you buzzing, you bussing, you bussing like 'blaka'
You switching it up, came here to fuck, tell me now who's the imposter?
I see how your feelings got involved
Forgot that I was supposed to run everytimeyou called
Lay down on the bed and take it off
I break you off, problem solved
Do it quick, baby strip
I get you wet as you can get, I make it drip
Won't you gon' show me who's it is?
Won't you gon' show me you the shit?
Crawled up in it, I'm all up in it
When I fall up in it now I got you screaming "you the shit"
You the shit, you the shit, you the shit
I'm a beast, I'm a freak, she was mad at a nigga
Now she glad that a nigga got her legs in the air like this
You the shit, you the shit, you the shit
You the shit, you the shit, you the shit, you the shit
You the shit, you the shit, you the shit, you the shit

[Intro]

[Intro]
I know, I know, I know

[Verse 1]
I never had time for you
Spending my nights, caught in that life
The hell am I supposed to do
When everything wrong, feels so right?
I, been losing the fight with my ego
Girl to the right won’t let me go
Making it hard on a nigga
To look away and turn it down

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been drinking way too much to be thinking about love
To be thinking about us, so I'ma pour another cup
And I can’t leave this club alone, so it ain't about trust
I got a reputation, good or bad, so what, I gotta keep it up

[Chorus]
I've been living my life in these clubs
I've been giving my life to these girls
The bright lights like drugs
The fast life don’t slow up
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I get it
I know, I know, I know I know
I know, yeah, I know, yeah
I've been living my life in these clubs
I've been giving my life to these girls
The  bright lights like drugs
The fast life don’t slow up
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I get it
I know, I know, I know I know
I know, yeah, I know, yeah
There’s some things I can’t get back, yeah
It’s some things I can’t get back, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
There’s some things I can’t get back
I know, I know, I know, I know
There’s some things I can’t get back

[Verse 2]
If you’re looking for love, you won’t find it here
I’ve had my share of that life
But I never have time to give
'Cause I always spread myself thin
I'm losing the fight with my ego
It’s like you won’t let me go
And you’re making it hard on a nigga
To look away and turn it down

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been drinking way too much to be thinking about love
To be thinking about us, so I'ma pour another cup
And I can’t leave this club alone, so it ain't about trust
I got a reputation, good or bad, so what, I gotta keep it up

[Chorus]
I've been living my life in these clubs
I've been giving my life to these girls
The bright lights like drugs
The fast life don’t slow up
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I get it
I know, I know, I know I know
I know, yeah, I know, yeah
I've been living my life in these clubs
I've been giving my life to these girls
The  bright lights like drugs
The fast life don’t slow up
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I get it
I know, I know, I know I know
I know, yeah, I know, yeah
There’s some things I can’t get back, yeah
It’s some things I can’t get back, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
There’s some things I can’t get back
I know, I know, I know, I know
There’s some things I can’t get back
There’s some things I can’t get back, yeah
It’s some things I can’t get back, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
There’s some things I can’t get back
I know, I know, I know, I know
There’s some things I can’t get back

[Intro: Meek Mill]
(Cuff your chick)
You heard that
They call me Meek Milly aka Mr. Philadelphia
And as my nigga Big Re would say
If you don't like it kill your fucking self nigga

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I got my first eight ball and I went bananas
Cause I started flipping like them little mini cameras
Turned that to a quarter turned a quarter into a half
Somebody tell them niggas with them bricks up on their ass
First time I seen them whip it was my nigga Smooch
When I was broke he used to tell me go and get the loot
Niggas ain't riding they pussy cause they pick and choose
Hit you in your head you go in shock just like you're Pikachu
I see you chasing around them bitches trying to fit the 

[?]
That's why I'm at the dealer now trying to pick the coupe
Cause y'all was at the club and I was at the trap
Shit I was patient wasn't rushing like no running back
Shit I was waiting cause I had that money coming back
Put them youngins out there with that work and they was running back
Ya I'm like what you know about it
Ask them niggas about me in my hood they know I'm about it
I got it
Selling anything to make a profit
Hustle like a muhfucking nigga in the projects
Money on my mind and my muhfucking conscience
Cause I'm going to get it nigga tell me if you with it nigga

[Hook: Meek Mill] (x2)
I'm a dope boy I do dope boy shit
All these karats in my bezel that's a dope boy wrist
I can turn a one into a two that's my dope boy trick
See that bad bitch standing there that's my dope boy bitch

[Verse 2: Mel Love]
Six on your head shot
All these niggas sleeping on me about to get their bed rocked
All these niggas creeping on me about to get your egg shot
Gun his ass down and his ass until his head pop
Compact 

[?] with a ladder and a red dot
Slide up on them niggas ask them niggas what their bread bout
Nigga where that bread at
Make them niggas cash out
Soon as them niggas pass off we back off and stamp out
I mean I be on a cash route
Get it on a fast route
Get it then we mash out
Ask me what my past bout
Big twenties the pass out
Fucking with them bitches tipped them brought my whole stash out
I hit my nect up he be like what now
I be like six points he be like touch down
We head hunting you should duck down
Or get bucked down when we bust around

[Hook: Meek Mill] (x2)

[Verse 3: Mike Tucker]
Well I'm the dope boy
Wearing Gucci and that Louie boy
Money up to here but unemployed
Still selling them squares so my pockets getting bigger
"Are you really that nigga that count it?" Yea I'm that nigga
I got it if you show it I don't care whoever know it
See my bitch all in the mall and its my money she be blowing
While I back up at the spot got an order for a block
Got to get that shit together cause the money never stop
Got the 

[?] in handy and I'm about to take a point
He won't even know what's missing I'm the man up in the kitchen
And I got these niggas fishing got their 

[?] all in they hands
But I got to hit the store cause I need another can
Now I'm in Home Depot about to cop some acetone
And I ain't removing paint I'm about to put you on
Told my cousin bring the press I'm about to make it stretch
Show you how to get that money that's a dope boy at his best

[Hook: Meek Mill] (x2)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tell me something I don't know
I'm flexing on 'em like torsos
These niggas slipping like bar soap
These niggas listening, use Morse code
Boy, nigga sipping like parched throat
Ahe-he-hem, excuse me?
These niggas talking that beef shit
We'll check into it like the room's cheap
And all we sell is the greatest feeling on Earth
They paint me as a villain, I just autograph the artwork
Ain't got nothing left to prove, unless I got to prove it in court
Live fast, die young, and leave a beautiful corpse, yes, Lord
My nigga order like twenty bricks
I sent five bricks with four chicks
Riding with these guns, that's carpooling
Bought extra clips when I dove in
Miss Snow White, we snowed in
Nigga, miss me with that ho shit
Kill all rats, I toast to that
And watch everybody I toast wit
Kill everybody you close with
Just don’t stick your nose in my bullshit
Cause I close it like a clothespin
The people that I rolls with
Will leave holes in what you drove in
If anyone in that car live
You tell that nigga I owe him, yeah
I got my mind right, my money right
My head on my shoulder
And my eyesight a little blurry, but
It's staying on my quota
And we find out Mom's address
And your head get mailed over
Nigga, you make that bed, you lay in that bed
Or get that bitch made over
Tunechi

[Hook]
You so crazy
Tunechi, you so crazy
Bitch, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
They say "Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi
Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi, you so crazy"
Bitch

[Verse 2]
Tell me something I don’t know
I’ll tell you something I do know
Like money, drugs, bitches, guns
Niggas call me "Mucho"
Got witches all in my broom closet
Got little killers in JuCo
We’ll find out your business hours
And pop up like new toast
Like, danger taste like glucose
My shadow don’t get too close
To that new nigga with my old hoes: kudos
For my niggas on Rikers Island back there playing Uno
Getting swole like Popeye for niggas walking around like Bruno
I’m in the bed with a duo, laid up like two points
AK to your face; knock half off, like coupons
Too cool for school, but I sold cool points to schoolboys
Tell the cops, We don’t name drop, that's like droppin newborns
Nigga you crazy

[Interlude]
You so crazy, Tunechi
These hoes made me

[Verse 3]
Nigga tell me somethin I don't know
Like where the fuck did my heart go?
And show me somethin I haven’t seen
And give me what helped Martin sleep
On the same night he had a dream
And take me to where I’ve never been
But not to where I never be in
I ain’t never scared, but I’m scared of me
Me vs. Me, I need a referee
Need weaponry, especially if the treasury in jeopardy
Fuck deputy, big letter B
Need equity, need credit cleaned
To trafficking from peddling like everything
From amphetamines to medicine
These niggas sweeter than nectarine and Grenadine, ha!

[Hook]
You so crazy
Tunechi - you so crazy. Bitch
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
They say Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi
You so cray, bitch

[Verse 4]
Tell me somethin I don’t know
Like what happened to hard coke?
You can call me Eddie cause I stay ready
My family call me Eduardo
I’m music to these bitches ears
I hit that ass like the wrong note
My bitch bad, with corn rows
With boots on in farm clothes
You can find me prancin in the finest mansion
With the finest dancer with a height advantage
She want cocaine, pills, and weed, liquor and dick
She gotta micro manage
I'm just eatin rappers
They go nice in salads
With some diced up carrots
I just like a challenge
Psychopathic, so psychopathic
Nigga give me credit, or my balance
Lil Tunechi

[Outro]
Stand up niggas
(And I bump my head when I stand up)

[Hook: Meek Mill]

Everytime I look at her same time you throw it back like that

[Chorus]
It's been one week since we got to see
Cheatin' lovers and cousins that marry
Five days since they had the show
With the hermaphrodite, the slut, and the crack ho
Three days since we heard the tale
About the guy who learned his woman was a She-Male
Yesterday it occurred to me
That I've been watching a bit too much Jerry Springer

[Verse 1]
Holy cow, did you see it last week?
Well, they had this one freak
Who sucker-punched his whole family
Do your recall when the brawl
Became a total free-for-all?
And Jerry's in the middle tryin' to be the referee
Hey, see the stripper with the implants?
She likes to lap dance
And date the boyfriend of her mother
And now here comes Jerry's next guest
And it's a slugfest
'Cause it's her trailer trash brother
Nymphomaniac is back on crack
It's like When Animals Attack!
They all exhibit reprehensible behavior
Hit 'em in the nose, tear off their clothes
Step on their toes, that's how it goes
They get so violent they have to sign a waiver
They're always swearin', cursin', kicking butt, and pointing blame
On the air? They don't care, they got no shame
There was this one guy who I'm sure felt a little strange
When he found out that his wife had a sex change
They have a tendency to scream and yell constantly
They have a history of ripping off their shirts

[Chorus]
It's been one week since they had the fight
With the Siamese twins and the transvestite
Five days since that awful brawl
They still haven't got the blood off the wall
It's been three days since the bitter feud
Between the KKK and that gay Jewish Black Dude
Yesterday it finally dawned on me
I'm spending way too much time on that Jerry Springer

[Bridge: Weird Al and Tress MacNeille]
Baby, I've been sleeping with your sister
Oh? Well, which one?
All of them
Oh! Well, I've been sleeping with your best friend Jake!
Oh, yeah? Well, me too!
And I've been sleeping with your dog Woofie!
Oh! Woofie, you bitch! Well, I'm also sleeping with your pet goat!
That goat doesn't love you!

[Verse 2]
Once you start watchin', theres just no stoppin'
Your brain shuts down, then your IQ's droppin'
Jerry's the king of confrontation
He's a sensation
He puts the "sin" in "syndication"
It's totally worthless, like a bad check
It's like a train wreck
Don't wanna stare but you can't look away
Like Sally Jessy, he does talk shows
But with more weirdos
The ratings jumpin' higher everyday
If you've seen the show, well, then you know
It's just as low as you can go
The guests are tacky and they're lacking in their hygiene
And pretty soon, some ugly goon
Comes in the room and then it's boom
In the face of some unsuspecting Drag Queen
Well it's the kinda show where people scream obscenities
Yankin' hair, throwin' chairs at their hubbies
"Jerry! Jerry!", now the crowd starts their favorite chant
Should I turn off my TV? I just can't!
I have a tendency to watch it religiously
I have a history of taping each one

[Chorus]
It's been one week since the show about
Psycho Killers with problems they should work out
Five days since the big surprise
When some loser's wife says she's still dating 20 guys
Three days since he interviewed
A bunch of psychic porn star midgets who were all nude
Yesterday it occurred to me
That I've been watching a bit too much Jerry Springer

[Outro]
Tired of wasting my time on that Jerry Springer
I've got way too much class to watch Jerry Springer
Come over here and pull on my finger

We can have the world shining in stellar, stellar light
We can make our dreams brighter in stellar, stellar light
Crossing the sun together, we are the ones to make it
We can have the world shining in stellar, in stellar light

[Verse 1]
In the new better, Lu ether, Lu effort like two extras
Four actors, no rappers, hundred takes for a hundred keeps
I went a hundred straight for a hundred weeks
That's too real from a projector
Set trippin' 'em black kid and put a light beam on that white screen
Black sport, take that boy pay, that's oy vey but I take that
Make great rap, I can 

[Censored] then bake that and give you cake back
I felt like I Superman with his cape trapped
Then Lu perform in no uniform in my human form
And still super to 'em so you safe at
Mi casa es su casa, throw a ball where your base at
In the worst case, they at first base cause I threw a ball where they face at
And they don't want seconds, I was so sick that I threw up all where they plates at
If the money small, then we money ball, and put us all where first place at
Bless up

[Hook: Jason Gill]
We can have the world shining in stellar, stellar light
We can make our dreams brighter in stellar, stellar light
Crossing the sun together, we are the ones to make it
We can have the world shining in stellar, in stellar light

[Verse 2]
Energy, not friends
Those are just the enemies of my enemies
Violins, all inside my symphony
But I'm composed when I execute
Over drum rolls in the face of all these rim shots
I Sprewell, if my rim stops put a new spin on that movement
Did it for the streets, now I'm tryna do it for the museums
Good stated I ain't hood enough
Good cause the hood ain't good enough
I want whole worlds with soul girls that pose well at my parade
Celebrating before elevating to a destination tryna isolate
Activist or artist? Fuck with me cause I'm smart bitch
No fuck you, cause you aren't this and you should fuck with me cause I'm smart
Have smart kids all started on armpits
Then dearly depart from the part played and got the script started for part 6
Bless up

[Hook: Jason Gill]
We can have the world shining in stellar, stellar light

[Verse 3]
You play with it but I stay with it
That's the reason I stay with it
I live with it, did did it
Queen Jonylah gon' live with us
You 'bout that, then we real
We spill a lil Mountain Dew for E. Till
On the mountain top that we built
We will, that's it
Chiraq to the Brad Pitts
Foreign borders to the poorest corners of Port-Au-Prince
No preach, no beach, so sure
More schools, no war
No more, oh lord
Star light, it's your world go for it
Bless up

[Verse 1]
You're bigger than Elvis
You're cooler than B.I.G
You're smashin' the dishes
You're Billy the Kid
You're very American, sugar
Marry me, Dick
I love you

[Verse 2]
We're on the road to the Jersey Shore
One stoppin' at the Staten Island Mall
Pullin' over at the 7/11
And you buy me pie because I'm sweeter than heaven

[Verse 3]
You say you love everything I am
Love my lips and my golden tan
You love my heart-shaped sunglasses
Love my heart-shaped sunglasses
Love my heart-shaped sunglasses
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
Top down, heaven like you're crazy
You let me drive, I'll let you go all the way
I'll never ever, ever, ever let you get away, away

[Verse 1]
While all the time that I was loving you
You were busy loving yourself
I would stop breathing if you told me to
Now you're busy loving someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
Eleven years out of my life
Besides the kids I have nothing to show
Wasted my years, a fool of a wife
I should have left your ass a long time ago

[Chorus]
Well, I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No, I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears (Can't do it)
Well, I'm not gon' cry (I said I can't do it)
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears (You were never worth my tears)
No, I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears

[Verse 2]
I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
Eleven years I've sacrificed
And you can leave me at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side
I should have left your ass a thousand times

[Chorus]
Well, I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
(I deserve better)
No, I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
(Never gonna shed a tear, no)
Well, I'm not gon' cry (I said I can't do it)
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears
(I'm not gonna cry no more)
No, I'm not gon' cry (No, no, no, no)
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears

[Bridge]
I know there are no guarantees (Guarantees)
In love, you take your chances (Don't take chances)
But somehow it seems unfair to me (So unfair)
Look at the circumstances
Through sickness and health, 'til death do us part
Those were the words that we said from our hearts
So now when you say that you're leaving me
I don't get that part

[Verse 3]
I was your lover and your secretary
Working every day of the week
Was at the job when no one else was there
Helping you get on your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
Eleven years I've sacrificed
And you can leave me at the drop of a dime
Swallowed my fears, stood by your side
I should have left your ass a thousand times

[Chorus]
Well, I'm not gon' cry (Again, and again, and again)
I'm not gon' cry
(I said I should've been gone, gone, gone, gone)
I'm not gon' shed no tears
No, I'm not gon' cry (I'm not gonna cry)
It's not the time (It's not worth the time)
'Cause you're not worth my tears
Well, I'm not gon' cry
(I'm not gonna shed a tear 'cause you lied)
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears (I'm not gonna cry)
No, I'm not gon' cry (I said I can't do it)
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears
(You were never worth my tears)

[Chorus/Outro]
Well, I'm not gon' cry (No, I'm not gonna cry)
I'm not gon' cry
I'm not gon' shed no tears (All the tears I cried)
No, I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time (I'm not gonna shed a tear)
'Cause you're not worth my tears (But you're wrong)
Well, I'm not gon' cry (But you're wrong)
I'm not gon' cry (You're wrong)
I'm not gon' shed no tears (I'm not gonna shed a tear)
No, I'm not gon' cry
It's not the time
'Cause you're not worth my tears

Yeah
Ursher, baby
This is for the A

[Chorus: Usher]
Shawty, I don’t mind
If you dance on a pole, that don’t make you a ho
Shawty, I don’t mind
When you work until three, if you’re leaving with me
Go make that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
'Cause I know how it is, go and handle your biz
And get that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
You can take off your clothes, long as you coming home
Girl, I don’t mind

[Verse 1: Usher]
The ballers in here tonight, they gon’ buy a hundred bottles
As soon as you shake it I know they gon’ make it colossal in here
'Cause shawty you thinkin’ them tricks that you do with your body
Got all of these niggas they crowding around you like they seen Beyonce in here (she here, she here!)
You want your own and you need your own, baby, who am I to judge?
'Cause how could I ever trip about it when I met you in the club?
I make enough for the both of us, but you dance anyway
You know I was raised in the A

[Chorus: Usher]
Shawty, I don’t mind
If you dance on a pole, that don’t make you a ho

[Verse 2: Usher]
When you get off of work I’ll be ready to go in the ‘Rari
And when we get home we’ll have us our own private party in here
So I don’t worry at all about the things they do or say
I love you anyway
You can twerk while in a split, you racking up them tips
Your body rock and your booty poppin’, I’m proud to call you my bitch
They be lookin’, but they can’t touch you, shawty, I’m the only one to get it
So just go ahead and keep doing what you doing

[Chorus: Usher]
Shawty, I don’t mind

You can take off your clothes, long as you coming home
Girl, I don’t mind

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
(It's ya boy, Juicy J)
I’m just tryna cut her up, tryna bust a nut
Tryna take somebody bitch, turn her to a slut
Tryna fill my cup, tryna live it up
Throw some hundreds on that ass, walk her out the club
(Yeah, ho) Lap dance for the first date
Bet I threw a few bands, that’s third base
It’s okay if you work late
We can still party like it’s your birthday
We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place
Blow her own gas, no Rolaid
When we in the bed she like to roleplay
Tell her friend to join in both ways

[Chorus: Usher]
Shawty, I don’t mind
If you dance on a pole, that don’t make you a ho
Shawty, I don’t mind
When you work until three, if you’re leaving with me
Go make that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
'Cause I know how it is, go and handle your biz
And get that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
You can take off your clothes, long as you coming home
Girl, I don’t mind

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I said one rental two bricks
One chance two glits
One man stay away from niggas with the loose slips
One hood two strips
One pot two crisps
Supposed to keep that paper in a place where you can do shit
First you find a youngin that can run and it can move quick
See what he can grab then front him that right after two flips
Got to put him on the boat he selling like a cruise ship
But make sure he ain't pussy if they rush you let that tool spit
Cool then, right before you know it you be movin'
Keep it to the 

[?] you gon' keep the fiends groovin'
Make sure you can keep a nect that can keep them things movin'
Cause shit these niggas selling it be loosin' prove it
Once the money rollin' all the bitches get to choosin'
And niggas get to hating, you winning and they loosin'
That's how I get for the money though
Them niggas in the way should my advice I say fuck 'em though

[Hook: Mike Knoxx]
We got our hands in everything this is how we do it
You want to get that dough we gon' show you how to do it
You trying to move that work we gon' show you how to move it
You chop it then you bag it let your block run through it
Come on come on come on come on
We got our hands in everything this is how we do it
This is how we do it this is how we do it

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Block still poppin'
Shit still jumpin'
Fiends still coppin'
Money still comin'
Damn its like I ain't skipped a beat
On a corner with that mag in my bag like Meek
The coke price up and down niggas rather sell weed
Nah I don't fuck around, paying what that scale read
Yeah, I'm back to the block with it
I back in that kitchen with the pot with it
Arm getting stiff when I pop whip it
Pushed rocks since Flavor Flav clocked wit it
No braids waves under the Sox fitted
Black Dickies Chuck Taylor's no socks with it
Getting paid like Eric B. and Rah with it
Check out my melody
Twenty-nine arrests and two felonies
Who getting down man you better be
And laying it down forever, B
The way I hold the fifth so steadily
Shit make a nigga lose his memory
Peed Crack flow props like a Kennedy
Bust a remedy
I cause injury
Bean Mack you insane you ain't into me
I used to pop pin balls and play centipede
Now I pop pin balls at my enemies
Playing with that sawed off 

[?]

[Hook: Mike Knoxx]

[Verse 3: Mel Love]
I said I grind now to shine later
Trapping tying to get this paper
I got poor puppeteer
Steer niggas escalator
Gear niggas touch his paper
Get hooked to a respirator
Hit him in his back and watch his chest just break up
I said I be on the south side
Banging up my tool boy
Bitches say I'm ignorant Jamaican style rude boy
Beat they shit like Timberland then jump back in my groove boy
Slim Shady Eminem
Maybach we be giving them
Sandy brown cinnamons the post stay with my men in them
They go nuts like M&M's
Throw nuts up out this M and M
Nine milli pop wheelie pump up my adrenaline
Circles how I'm getting them
Them blocks is what I get it off
Circles like I'm spending them
Them blocks is where we get it all
Thirty shot clipping them
So ask him what he's hitting for
Uh, I said I'll show you how to do it
Quarterback I'll show you how to move it

[Hook: Mike Knoxx]

[Hook:??]
Aye so if you talking about me then you talking bout money
Don't even throw my name if you ain't talking about hunnids
I do me so do you (I gotta get it I gotta get it)
I do me so do you (I gotta get it I gotta get it)
I do me so do you (I gotta get it I gotta get it)
If you ain't really know me know I'm a hundred mile running
Looking for the top stop ya its the way a nigga gunning
I do me so do you (I gotta get it I gotta get it)
I do me so do you (I gotta get it I gotta get it)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Look I do me hommie do you
If real recognize real nigga who you
I'm in that new Camero every time I swoop trough
Looking all black everything on them 22's
All them niggas say I'm hot and all them hoes say I'm cool
Cause I be getting to the money and my swagger through the roof
Got that hater looking funny doesn't matter what they do
But if they say they getting money tell them niggas show the proof
Now if you talking about this then we talking about that
We ain't talking about shit if we ain't talking about stacks
We ain't talking about bitches nigga pardon my 

[?]
Money is the motivation hear it all in my raps

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I ain't got to do me I just let your girl it
Put my dick all in her mouth you hear about it you a loser
Ha ha I said youngin' bout his paper
Getting to the money like mahfuck a hater
My Glock on ya my block on
I pull up in the six you know the top gone
Look like a spotlight I put my watch on
We making movies bitch got get your popcorn
I don't give a fuck what you heard about me
Bet you heard I get money I'm a certified G
I'm a north side nigga but you know that I be
On the south side with my niggas getting to the money

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Bad bitches big money know I live that
I woke up early in the morning where the bread at
Hollywood to MIA you know I did that
And when it come to Philly nigga know I is that
I'm getting money I'm paid
Look at them niggas throwing shade
Huh I'm getting money I'm paid
Look at them niggas hating throwing shade
I do me, do you
I do me, do you
I do me, do you
I gotta get it gotta get it gotta get it I'm gone

[Post-Chorus]
One, two, look at you
Three, four, she locked the door
I keep knocking and knocking and knocking and knocking
(­knocks)

[Verse 1]
She was born in Paris at the age of 21
Love knew her, but she didn’t know love
Love didn’t hear her when she cried, love didn’t stand by her side
On the most important nights, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But now she’s flying high you can’t hurt her no more
Now she’s locked the door cause you broke the key
And she got a bright smile on her face now that she got that little
Taste
She just wants more, she just wants more

[Chorus: Choir & Robin Thicke]
She locked the door
(I kept trying to tell you you were pushing me too far)
She locked the door
(I kept trying to warn you you were slowly breaking my heart)
She locked the door
(I kept giving you all I had but you took way too much)
She locked, locked, locked, locked, locked, locked that door
(And I don’t know what this is but I know this ain’t love)

[Post-Chorus]

[Verse 2]
One morning the tears started rolling down her empty face
That sparkle in her eye had been abruptly replaced
When I touched her she said wait, when I kissed her she pulled away And I knew it was over, cause she had nothing left to say

[Pre-Chorus] + 

[Chorus] + 

[Post-Chorus]

[Bridge]
Baby let me in, baby I miss my best friend, yes I do
She locked the door, you can’t hurt her no more
She locked, locked, locked, locked, locked, locked that door

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Don’t leave me out here in the cold
Ooh turn the porch light on
At least open the doggy-door
Throw a friend a juicy bone
Baby please give me a little hope, all I need is a little hope

One, two, silly fool
Three, four, she locked the door
I keep knocking and knocking and knocking and knocking

[Chorus]
There she goes, with the pieces from my heart
There she goes, and now my teardrops start

[Verse 1]
And here I go, once again
Through these lonely heartaches and pain
That's all remain, all remain
Now I know, love is a guessing game

[Chorus]
She goes, with the pieces from my heart
There she goes, and now my teardrops start

[Verse 2]
Who's gonna put back, the pieces, to my broken heart?(oooh oooh oooh)
Once again, once again, now I know, this could be the end
And she gone (with the pieces from my heart)
There she goes, let me tell ya (and now my teardrops start)

And here I go, once again
Through these lonely heartaches and pain
That's all remain
Now I know, this could be the end
She goes (with the pieces from my heart)

[Outro]
There she goes, and now my teardrops start
There she goes, with the pieces from my heart
(Pieces, pieces from mine heart)
Then, there she goes

[Verse 1]
How many times I told you (I love you)?
But now you want to say that (we are through)
What a more, can I do?
What more can I say to you?
Now you're gone

[Verse 2]
Do you remember that first (night we met)?
That was a moment I (never will forget)
Love was at first sight
You came walking through the pale, pale moonlight
(Pale, pale moonlight)

[Verse 3]
Do you remember that first (night we met)?

[Intro – Meek Mill]
It’s the dream team bitch
Mr. Philadelphia
Philly in this bitch, Meek Million
Jalil Beats, holla at me

[Verse 1 – Meek Mill]
All I ever wanted was a million and a bad bitch
Used to blow my money and wake up like where my stacks went
I was  17 I left my crib, went where the cash went
And popped back in my hood in an Aston, mansion
Flying with the top off, and I’m getting topped off
I’m about my chicken bitch, and I spit that hot sauce
Mustard yellow Breitling, tell 'em catch up, I’m a hot dog
Hood nigga, but I live my life like I’m a rock star
Shot bar, fuck no, take me where the bottles at
Mr. Rose baby, get a lot of that
Copy that, roger that, I be where it’s popping at
Jahlil he put a hit out on that beat I b-b-body that
Imma take the offshore, baby, cause it costs more
Elevator take me to the top, right on the ball floor
Shawty tried to jump inside the coupe, can’t find the car door
Why you think I work so much and grind so fucking hard for

[Hook – Meek Mill]
Hey, bottles up, shawty drop me down
Ask who fucking with me, not a sound
Hear them haters talking, but they whispering
So what they saying bout me, cause I’m getting it
We ballin, we ballin
Ballin like it’s Spalding
Everytime I wake up all I hear is money calling
Ballin and ballin, tearing up the Martin
Call me Mr. wrecking ball the way I break them walls in

[Verse 2 – Shizz Nitty]
Fuck niggas and bitches
Ain’t Shizzy a dope
Used to have weed, now they say the bottom got dope
Knew a nigga had soap, and they rocked his ass
Saw they did a round hit, and they stopped his ass
Million dollar nigga, they call him socks in the air
They don’t play around anigga, they got Glocks over there
Rest in peace to Lil 

[?], he was just in the way
When them bullets from up top, man they started to spray
It’s just another story from around the way
Where we keep a tough crew and them boys don’t play
75 nigga ball, rest in peace to bubble
I like my remmy and my rose, bud is 

[?]
Keep winning, and keep on losing
You keep on hating and your bitch keep choosing
You think she ain’t?
Motherfucker we got bottles sitting everywhere
Ain’t too many niggas models sitting everywhere

[Hook]

[Spoken: Meek Mill]
Fuck y'all be at? I mean...
I go hard for the motherfucking city I was raised in, nigga
Ask about me! You ask about Philly
You know what they gon' tell 'em Drama
First name that's gon' come up, nigga: Meek Milly
Gangsta!

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Is you niggas hating cause you mad
Or is you mad cause you hating on me
I don't know
Let's get it

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Patron mixed with Nuvo
Got me feeling cool though

[?] in my pockets looking like they sumo
Different color diamonds like we playing Uno
We racing in the Mazi, jumping we jump 

[?]
Shitting on these haters we don't see them not at all
But if we do happen to see them break they jaws just like they 

[?]
We break them off we break them all
Catch the slipping make them fall
I'm like Shaq all in the paint I bang on them they too small
I wasted sipping on an Ace
Kissing on the bad bitch she tell me she can taste it
Bout to take her home and hit that 

[?] like its the Matrix
Tell her she the one and I'll be gone when she awaking
I'm 

[?], ask me who I mess with I say money
Niggas say they go my bitch but she gon' always come back to me
Ain't that funny (ha ha ha)
Omg MOB Niggas say they fucking with me I just tell them N-O-T
Ain't that funny (ha ha ha)
Omg MOB Niggas say they fucking with me I just tell them N-O-T
Ain't that funny (ha ha ha)
Omg MOB Niggas say they fucking with me I just tell them N-O-T
I'm the hottest in the city bout to take over America
Any bitch you see me with you know I'm probably sharing her
Niggas know I'm on, about to eat like cafeteria
Serious, trying to lock the game like I'm a Terrier

[Hook: Meek Mill]
You tryna sell a brick I'm tryna sell a house
I'm trying to fuck that bitch you trying to buy her out
I'm really on some shit what would I lie about
Get fly you got some Gucci get fly I'm flying out
Switching lanes We be switching planes
When I was trapping I used to get it from what's his name
But now I'm rapping I'm 

[?] in the game
And I'm balling like I'm Spalding

[Verse 2: Mel Love]
Why they ball the block what they hating for
Why they tell me stop fuck is they waiting for
I ain't like to smoke all I do is double cup

[?]
All I move is butter yo, flooded like New Orleans
Make these haters nauseous wrist wear gorgeous
Haters back up off 'em diamond chain flawless
Sale failed then I just pick it up like a forklift
Champagne bottle pop models watch corporate

[?] on top we on it
I turn nine into a bird and I make it fly
I turn a bird into a Benz and I make it drive
I turned raps into tracks and I made it here
I turn this 

[?] into a career hope it make me rich
And it make me that and it make me this
Ice all up on my wrist like my shit swollen

[Hook: Meek Mill]

[Verse 3: E. Ness]
Take a look at me and you can tell I live the high life
Running with them wolves way before they made Twilight
All I'm really tryna tell these boppers get their mind right

[?] get some haters to hating though in some hindsight
They call me Mr. Lee but never ever did I crime fight
When they come and get 

[?] this cheese or blind mice
Spit that Walter Cronkite
Fucking all these bitches like its prom night
Flying triple diamond that's what I like
Let's get wasted
So shitfaced to the point that I lost my bird or misplaced it
So high I can bump my head on a spaceship
I can't feel my face no more I need a face lift
Woke up from the Matrix
Slid through the block in the latest
After doing six months out Vegas
All I'm tryna say is
I don't hate the game just the player
Until that pound cake come in layers

[Hook: Meek Mill]

[Intro]
My brave, my brave
My brave face

[Verse 1]
I've been living in style
Unaccustomed as I am to the luxury life
I've been hitting the town
And it didn't hit back
I've been doing the rounds
Unaccustomed as I am to the time on my hands
Now I don't have to tell anybody
When I'm going to get back

Ever since you went away, I've had the sentimental inclination
Not to change a single thing
As I pull the sheet back on the bed
I want to go bury my head in your pillow

[Chorus]
Now that I'm alone again
I can't stop breaking down again
The simplest things set me off again
Take me to that place
Where I can find my brave face
Where I can find my brave face
My brave, my brave, my brave face

[Verse 2]
I've been living a lie
Unaccustomed as I am to the work of a housewife
I been breaking up dirty dishes
And been throwing them away

Ever since you left I have been trying to compose a "Baby, would you please come home" note meant for you
As I clear away another untouched TV dinner from the table I made for two

[Chorus]
Now that I'm alone again
I can't stop breaking down again
The simplest things set me off again
Take me to that place
Where I can find my brave face
Where I can find my brave face
My brave, my brave, my brave face

[Intro: DeVyne Stevens]
Konvict
Stand up, salute
DeVyne Stevens, up front is in the building, let's go
It's the Konvict album
Yeah, y'all done fucked up now
I got money now, nigga
I got enough money to free all the stars

[Verse 1: Akon]
He ain't lying
If you selling, we ain't buying
If it's scattered on your block, you best believe we supplyin'
From a key down to a half a pound, a quarter to a dime
Tryin' to own a piece of Brooklyn like my niggas John Klein
Hey, you know me, I'm known to rock with it
Roll through your spot with it, post up block with it
Hey, you know me, I'm on the block with it
Non-stop with it, violate and get popped with it
Hey, so I suggest you keep stepping on me
'Cause you will rarely find me without my weapon on me
Got the whole Konvict squad bettin' on me
And now the dots around the world are now connectin' on me

[Chorus: Akon]
Hey now
A bunch of gangstas strapped, so make a way now
When they come wavin' them gats, you know to lay down
And give 'em all you got 'cause it's a shake down, oh oh oh
Hey now
A bunch of gangstas strapped, so make a way now
When they come wavin' them gats, you know to lay down
And give 'em all you got 'cause it's a shake down, oh oh oh
'Cause it's a shake down, oh oh oh
'Cause it's a shake down, oh oh oh
'Cause it's a shake down, oh oh oh
Do I make myself clear? Oh oh oh
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2: Akon]
A fleet of European cars in my driveway
Murcielago, Gallardo, Ferrari
My shortie ridin' shotgun bumping Sadie
Toes hangin' out the window, loadin' up my army
You know I keep a bad bitch breathin' on me
Also known to have no business with no beefin', homie
And won't hesitate to cock it when them people on me
So guess what? No exceptions to you neither, homie
You know I got that African connection
Locked up in a facility correction
I'm a star, style changed, hangin' like blow
Black royals in the front, we in the place now

[Chorus: Akon]
Hey now
A bunch of gangstas strapped, so make a way now
When they come wavin' them gats, you know to lay down
And give 'em all you got 'cause it's a shake down, oh oh oh
Hey now
A bunch of gangstas strapped, so make a way now
When they come wavin' them gats, you know to lay down
And give 'em all you got 'cause it's a shake down, oh oh oh
'Cause it's a shake down, oh oh oh
'Cause it's a shake down, oh oh oh
'Cause it's a shake down, oh oh oh
Do I make myself clear? Oh oh oh
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 3: Akon]
Now I'ma show you how to break this down
Peal back, show you how to shake this down
First nigga to create this sound
Can't believe it took a Konvict to shake this town
Dippin' European linen with the v-net
Diamond studded VVS's, no less
Kunta Kinte bracelet, lit up the whole set
My nigga, we on deck, bet' believe it's no sweat
Need street credibility, who you go get?
I give you that credibility for the right check
Keep your future on the shelf, quiet's where it's best kept
Don't want them upfront shooters bringin' red light

[Chorus: Akon]
Hey now
A bunch of gangstas strapped, so make a way now
When they come wavin' them gats, you know to lay down
And give 'em all you got 'cause it's a shake down, oh oh oh
Hey now
A bunch of gangstas strapped, so make a way now
When they come wavin' them gats, you know to lay down
And give 'em all you got 'cause it's a shake down, oh oh oh
'Cause it's a shake down, oh oh oh
'Cause it's a shake down, oh oh oh
'Cause it's a shake down, oh oh oh
Do I make myself clear? Oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
Put down that chainsaw and listen to me
It's time for us to join in the fight
It's time to let your babies grow up to be cowboys
It's time to let the bedbugs bite

You better put all your eggs in one basket
You better count your chickens before they hatch
You better sell some wine before its time
You better find yourself an itch to scratch

You better squeeze all the Charmin you can while Mr. Whipple's not around
Stick your head in the microwave and get yourself a tan

[Verse 2]
Talk with your mouth full
Bite the hand that feeds you
Bite off more than you chew
What can you do?
Dare to be stupid
Take some wooden nickels
Look for Mr. Goodbar
Get your mojo working now
I'll show you how
You can dare to be stupid

You can turn the other cheek
You can just give up the ship
You can eat a bunch of sushi and forget to leave a tip

[Chorus]
Dare to be stupid
Come on and dare to be stupid
It's so easy to do
Dare to be stupid
We're all waiting for you
Let's go

[Verse 3]
It's time to make a mountain out of a molehill
So can I have a volunteer
There's no more time for crying over spilled milk
Now it's time for crying in your beer

Settle down, raise a family, join the PTA
Buy some sensible shoes and a Chevrolet
Then party 'til you're broke and they drag you away
It's OK, you can dare to be stupid
It's like spitting on a fish
It's like barking up a tree
It's like I said you gotta buy one if you wanna get one free

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Burn your candle at both ends
Look a gift horse in the mouth
Mashed potatoes can be your friends

You can be a coffee achiever
You can sit around the house and watch Leave It To Beaver
The future's up to you
So what you gonna do

[Verse 5]
Dare to be stupid
Dare to be stupid
What did I say
Dare to be stupid
Tell me, what did I say
Dare to be stupid
It's alright
Dare to be stupid
We can be stupid alright
Dare to be stupid
Come on, join the crowd
Dare to be stupid
Shout it out loud
Dare to be stupid
I can't hear you
Dare to be stupid
OK, I can hear you now
Dare to be stupid
Let's go, Dare to be stupid
Dare to be stupid
Dare to be stupid
Dare to be stupid
Dare to be stupid
Dare to be stupid
Dare to be stupid
Dare to be stupid

[Hook:Gillie Da Kid]
When I was broke as a joke people used to hate on me
Now I'm on I don't need your money
Hommie I'mma be alright be alright be alright
Hommie I'mma be alright be alright be alright

Have the nerve to tell me I look good and now you see the ice
See the fame speak my name
Little hoes just being hoes

[?] when I was locked them little hoes ain't even write

[?] coldest nights living at the speed of life
Thinking when I touch I'm going to fuck them hoes and feed them right
When I was broke my nigga

Nigga I ain't never look back
And I've been getting to the money ever since you heard that

[Hook: Gillie Da Kid]

[Verse 2: Gillie Da Kid]
Shawty I gon be ok don't worry about me
I don't need a bitch for shit
Just some pussy and some lips
Pull up whips, think a while ago I was loosing
Now these hoes try to hop up in that Rover while its moving
What you expect money, power, and respect
Know I'm gon be ok as long as the boy he got his 

[?]
Know that Gilie don't write checks
I don't give a bitch shit
Old school like Ice Cube bubblicious and some dick

[?] at the higher got a suite

And I know these bitches sweet
Talking bout they want to eat
Dick until we skeet skeet
Like the Ying-Yang twins
But we won't give them no ends

[Hook: Gillie Da Kid]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
They used to tell me tough luck
My gear was all fucked up
My sneaks was all scuffed up
Until I came to fuck up
Baddest bitches here 

[?] I probably fucked her
And now these niggas flipping bricks couldn't even get with this
T.I.P told me the same bitches that the boss is fucking
Gon be fucking you now long as you go harder youngin
Told him it was all or nothing
Fuck them hoes don't call or nothing
Cause when I'm in the studio I'm tryna make a movie ho

You niggas can't stop me
The Man up top got me, let's get it

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Okay! Maybe it's my swagger
Every time I come around these haters getting madder
Gangstas in the kitchen wit it, whippin' up the batter
When them hoes see me they like Meek Mill you getting fatter

Della Reese I'm beasting shit
Now shut up ho and eat this dick

A Ménage just like Nicki is

And if you ask about around Philly they gon tell you I'm the streets

Meek Milly in this bag so I'm pulling out the louie
Just to fill it up with cash and my Gucci's full of truies
And my life is like a movie got these bitches all chewy
Pool party at my crib and I got your girl in my Jacuzzi

Helicopter in the back all I got to do is fly
Call me Maybach shawty when I hit than one-on-one
Doing 100 in the lanes like a nigga on the run

[Intro]
He's so hood, he's so damn hood
He's so hood, he's so damn hood

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Come help me mow yo lawn, mama, turn you up into a soldier
Head to the dreams, and your pretty legs on my shoulders
So don't lie to me I know you're scared of me
You ain't gotta be, cuz I'll have yo back as long as you stay on top of me
First I let her drive me (nyum), then I make her ride me (nyum)
She change her hair like every day like she miss Dennis Rodman
Say paying wit yo waist, shit, she can overcharge
Still rough around the edges, but money's not a problem
Take it to the hood, move out the hood, but I park the booth, got a pocketbook
Then I call the jeweler, bring the cooler, make it look like Gucci look (burr)
Shawty got a mean swag, I wanna fuck with her
She don't need no lame nigga
She need a thug nigga

[Hook 1: Ciara & Gucci Mane]
I ain't gotta worry about nothing
He's makin' trouble, always give me something
He's so hood, he's so damn hood
Down, keep it so right, and he do it good
I'm too hood for my own good
But we can ball to the mall down, it's all good
He's so hood, he's so damn hood
Crazy guy, but too hood for his own good

[Verse 2: Gucci Maine]
She know I like to smoke, love to gamble
I'm in my hood sittin' low in my Lambo (nyum)
And we can be a duo, a tandem
Come through Atlanta in back to back Phantom
Her mama like he ain't got no manners
But her mama like "damn, Gucci, handosme"
It's a date night, yeah I got my cake right
The diamonds in the air, flashin' brighter, that's some brake lights
No I'm not a trouble maker, I just make it double take (burr)
Shawty staring at me, but it's something make her hesitate
Maybe it's my reputation, maybe it's my entourage
I'm straight out the hood, but ain't no need to try to camouflage

[Hook 2: Gucci Mane & Ciara]
She ain't gotta worry (worry for nothing)
I hold it down, she too much for you suckers

She's hanging off in jewelry all on her
And all the girls want him, so you can tell them nothin
He's so hood, he's so damn hood
He's so hood, he's too hood for his own good
He's so hood, he's so damn hood
Crazy guy, but too hood for his own good

[Bridge: Ciara]
Keep it til' you die, but you can't be sick
Start rootin' for it, can't put it down like this
Find them in the (sun), find them in the 6
Find them in the air, somewhere in the bricks
Keep it til' you die, but you can't be sick
Start rootin' for it, can't put it down like this
Find them in the room, find them in the bay
Find them in New York, find them in L.A

[Hook 2]

It's my life, I'm a do what I do
And if you don't like, it's cool, fuck you

[Intro]
Check it out
I'm saying
You gonna be mine

[Verse 1]
First time I saw you, baby, you did something to me
That no else has ever done
It's something in your eyes caught me by surprise
And told me that you were the one

[Bridge 1]
But what's bad is I know you got a man
And he'll never understand
The chemistry between me and you
Something inside of me
Is saying you and I were meant to be
If you can think it, you can have it
That why I believe...

[Chorus]
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around

[Verse 2]
Now, every time I see you, baby, it's plain to see
That I'm everything you've been missing at home, baby
So much love to share, it's something in the air
Telling me I should never leave you alone

[Bridge 2]
But even though I know you got a man
He'll never understand
The chemistry between me and you
You can try to stop it, but it won't quit
You say you don't when I know that you want it
I know, one day you'll be mine

[Chorus]
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around
One day you'll be mine, mine
No more creeping, sleeping around
No whispering when he's around

[Pre-Chorus 1: Fergie]
All the things I know right now
If I only knew back then
There's no gettin' over, no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you

[Pre-Chorus 2: Chris Willis]
Wish I could spin my world into reverse
Just to have you back again
There's no gettin' over, there's no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you, no, no

[Verse: LMFAO]
(Bring it back)
Hey-hey, I can't forget you, baby
I think about you everyday
I tried to masquerade the pain
That's why I'm next to the booth
D-d-d-dance to the groove
But, but there is no, there is no (Just no gettin' over you)
Baby, it feels so right
To dance to the beat of night
That heat between you and I
Freak, freak to the morning light
We like to live life fast
And pour them shots up in the glass
But there is no, there is no (Just no gettin' over you)

[Chorus: LMFAO]
I'ma party, and party
And party and par' and par' and party
I'ma party, and party
And party and par' and par' and

[Pre-Chorus 1: Fergie]
All the things I know right now
If I only knew back then
There's no gettin' over, no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you

[Pre-Chorus 2: Chris Willis]
Wish I could spin my world into reverse
Just to have you back again
There's no gettin' over, there's no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you, no, no

[Chorus: LMFAO]
I'ma party, and party
And party and par' and par' and party
I'ma party, and party
And party and par' and par' and

[Bridge: Fergie]
People in the place
If you've ever felt love
Then you know, yeah, you know
What I'm talkin' about
There's no gettin' over

[Chorus: LMFAO]
I'ma party, and party
And party and par' and par' and party
And part and party
I'ma party, and party
And party and par' and par' and party
And party and party

[Verse 1]
Sunshine, blue skies, please go away
My girl has found another and gone away
With her went my future, my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room
I know to you, it might sound strange

[Refrain]
But I wish it would rain (Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
'Cause so badly I wanna go outside (Such a lovely day)
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain, oh yeah
People, this hurt I feel inside, words could never explain

[Refrain]
I just wish it would rain (Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Oh, let it rain, rain, rain, rain (Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Ooh baby, let it rain (Let it rain)
Oh yeah, let it rain

[Verse 3]
Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the windowpane
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain
'Cause raindrops will hide my teardrops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying (Crying, crying, crying)
Crying when I go outside
To the world outside my tears, I refuse to explain

[Refrain]
Oh I wish it would rain (Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Ooh baby, let it rain, let it rain (Let it rain, let it rain)
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes (Rain, rain, rain, let it rain)
Oh, let it rain (Doo doo doo doo)

[Outro]
Oh yeah, yeah, listen (Let it rain, let it rain)
I'm a man and I got my pride (Rain, rain, rain, rain, let it rain)
'Til it rains I’m gonna stay inside (Doo doo doo doo)
Let it rain (Let it rain, let it rain)

[Verse 1]
No one could tell me
That you were right for me, girl
You coulda told me
To run a lap around the world

[Pre-Chorus]
All that time I was hypnotized
While you—"ahh"—behind my back
Now my mind keeps me up all night
Why'd you have to say, "bye," like that?

[Chorus]
I shoulda cheated on you (Ah-ooh)
I was everything you wanted and more
I shoulda cheated on you (Ah-ooh)
Nobody told me I was dating a whore
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated

[Verse 2]
My friends shoulda told me
You weren't the one for me, girl (You weren't the one for me, girl)
'Cause you almost sold me
I bought a rock for you, girl (I bought a rock)

[Pre-Chorus]
All that time I was hypnotized
While you—"ahh"—behind my back
Now my mind keeps me up all night
Why'd you have to say, "bye," like that?

[Chorus]
I shoulda cheated on you (Ah-ooh)
I was everything you wanted and more
I shoulda cheated on you (Ah-ooh)
Nobody told me I was dating a whore
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated (Ah-ooh)

[Bridge]
Liar, liar
Hey, girl
You gon' tell all your friends that I'm talkin' about you
I'm talkin' about you
You gon' tell, you gon' tell
All your friends that I'm talkin' about you
I'm talkin' about you
I'm talkin' about you
Carolyne Stephens, this song is for you

[Chorus]
I shoulda cheated on you (Ah-ooh)
I was everything you wanted and more
I shoulda cheated on you (Ah-ooh)
Nobody told me I was dating a whore
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated, cheated, cheated
I shoulda cheated on you

[Intro: Boyz II Men & Mike Posner]

You were loving me, I was loving you
You can come over and we could have déjà vu
We could have déjà vu
You could come over and...

[Verse 1: Mike Posner & (Boyz II Men)]
I’m probably gonna compliment your hair-do
Right before we mess that shit all up (Mess that shit all up)

She was reminiscing in her mind
I'm just trying to make up for lost time
But we acting nervous
'Cause we've been here before

[Bridge: Mike Posner]
Nothing much has changed
You still feel the same
Don't pretend that you don't want to like I do
I know you think about
What it would feel like now
Come over, let's make a new memory

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Ooh, let's go back, I know it's been a minute
But I can do it better than I did when I did it
You were loving me, I was loving you
You can come over and we could have déjà vu
We could have déjà vu
You could come over and...

[Verse 1]
I used to be a sweetheart
I used to be alright
I tell myself I love you
But I'm creeping every night
When I met you at the party
And I told you you were pretty
I was honestly just tryin' to score
But you made me wait a week
Just to kiss you on the cheek
Now it's breaking my heart to break yours

[Chorus]
I said I love you in the summer
But will I love you in the fall?
I thought I wasn't like the others
Guess I'm an asshole after all
Come September, I'll be gone, gone, gone
Come September, I'll be gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2]
I used to be a good guy
I used to be alright
I tell myself I love you
But I'm creeping every night
When I met you at the party
And I told you you were pretty
I was honestly just tryin' to score

[Chorus]
I said I love you in the summer
But will I love you in the fall?
I thought I wasn't like the others
Guess I'm an asshole after all
Come September, I'll be gone, gone, gone
(Come September, I'll be) gone, gone, gone
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa, gone, gone, gone
(Come September, I'll be) gone, gone, gone

[Bridge]
I'd be lyin' if I said it didn't feel bad
I've been trying, but I just can't get the feeling back
When did I become one (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Of the bad guys

[Chorus]
I said I love you in the summer (I loved you in the summer)
I love you in the summer
But will I love you in the fall? (L-l-ove you in the fall)
I lo-lo-love you in the fall
I thought I wasn't like the others (I wasn't like the others)
Guess I'm an asshole after all
Come September, I'll be gone, gone, gone
Come September, I'll be gone, gone, gone
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa, gone, gone, gone
You gon' miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa

[Verse 1]
Excuse me, your heart is in my heart
Hello, you've taken this too far
Am I just a piece you push in your board game?
Have you been laughing all day long?
You like it when it's hard for me to see straight
You make it go on and on and on and on and on

[Chorus]
Save your goodbye
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go, go, go

[Verse 2]
Beg your pardon, you're standing on my love
Hello, have you not had enough?
Am I just a piece you push in your board game?
Have you been laughing all day long?
You like it when it's hard for me to see straight
You make it go on and on and on and on and on

[Chorus]
Save your goodbye
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go, go, go, go, go
Save your goodbye
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go, go, go, go, go

[Verse 3]
Hey, it's my time to shine
And my sword is trembling
You're back inside my mind
And I can't stop remembering
I say I'm chasing dreams but you know I've been
Running away from, running away from you
Some sort of comfort in your pain
I can't help from taking
No matter how I change
There will be no escaping
I say I'm chasing time but you know I've been
Running away from, running away from you

[Chorus]
Save your goodbye
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go, go, go, go, go
Save your goodbye
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go
You're everywhere I go, go, go, go, go

[Verse 2]
I know I'm moving too fast
But I can't help myself for tryin' to tell myself to slow down, slow down
And I feel like I'm 10 years old
But there's nothing I can do to stop thinking about you
I'm falling in love and I'm proud

They gonna tell everyone that I'm whipped whipped whipped, Whipped whipped whipped
But I don't even care cause

Hating cause you mad or mad because you hating
Its like I'm obligated haters I dominate them
Just pay attention now and leave your comment later
We get them numbers on the low like a denominator
Gold prezi looking like a magnum
Niggas say the fuck my bitches but I let them have them
Laughing cause I ain't comparing I just sharing
I be looking paparazzi the way my diamonds glaring
And I so fly that I be leering
Maserati I be steering
Riding by them haters staring
Wishing I was 

[?]
Knowing that they want to be me
Every time they see me, I be on the TV
Clarity be VVS and I the freshest
And my jewelry look fluorescent
And if you see a rapper diss me its just like you watching wrestling
Cause they be faker than a motherfucker
Fraud like a credit scam
If you want to book me its 10,000 plus a rubber band

[Hook: Meek Mill](x2)

[Verse 3: Shizz Nitty]
The real get realer
The lame get lamer
Shizz and Meek Milly baby its got to be a Flamer!
Lions and gorillas well baby I'mma tame her
Keep a strap on my whip that's my banger
My attitude is middle finger
I'm here now let my smell linger
I can rap and 

[?] singer
Is you hating cause you mad is you mad cause you hating
Got a couple years in the air talking about dating
They think that I don't know though
Them hoes fuck with them bros though
They be hating all on the low low
Want 

[?] off my polo
So rest in peace A.G. man

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
One night I was in Santos, it was lit like a candle
I was fly like a bird, I had on Stüssy Bape camo
With a cutie español, she had a booty like J-Lo
She had Jacobsen sandals, you've been trapped in the bando
She has to trap in the bando 'cause her mama got cancer
She can't work in the States because her green papers ain't legal (Yeah)
Fuck a "dame un beso", she be like, "Run de un peso" (Alright)
Push the molly to Pedro so she can feed her abuelo
She refuse to just settle on them shoes with them red soles
And refuse to be nude in front of them dudes on that dance pole (Alright)
She can't lose, she just ooze a bunch of ambition like Napo
-Leon, I could be ruler and ride the streets on my Benzo
So, then she get money vicarious off her friends though
'Cause a kid named Birdy look nerdy but he be after the bando (Alright)
She robbed Birdy for birdies, now Birdy after her head though
Hold on I think I see Birdy and Birdy killed my Cuban ho (Ferg)

[Verse 1]
She was like nothing I'd ever known
Her eyes shine like diamonds in a field of snow
Man that destiny led her to me
Made it feel that life was now complete
A thousand days have passed
And nights gone by
You can see the glow slowly fading from her eyes
Though she denies her pain and her dismay
Know I said this to her anyway

[Chorus]
Don't have to stay with someone that makes you cry
You'll end up killing all the love you have inside
Can't hope to see the sun
If you don't open your eyes
Girl don't let real love pass you by

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh oh no
Ooh don't let real love pass you by

[Verse 2]
I know you are nervous
But take it from me
Cause you deserve so much more than you receive
Listen to your heart and let it show
Don't hold on to your pain
Just let it go, let it go

[Chorus]
Don't have to stay with someone
That makes you cry
You'll end up killing all the love you have inside
Can't hope to see the sun
If you don't open your eyes
Girl don't let real love pass you by
Don't have to stay with someone
That makes you cry
You'll end up killing all the love you have inside
Can't hope to see the sun
If you don't open your eyes
Girl don't let real love pass you by

[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah
Girl don't let real love pass you by

[Bridge]
You can find a love you need
If you set your heart free
Girl...
Don't have to stay with someone
That makes you cry
Don't be discouraged baby
Don't let real love pass you by

[Chorus]
Don't have to stay with someone
That makes you cry
You'll end up killing all the love you have inside
Can't hope to see the sun
If you don't open your eyes
Girl don't let real love pass you by
Don't have to stay with someone
That makes you cry
You'll end up killing all the love you have inside
Can't hope to see the sun
If you don't open your eyes
Girl don't let real love pass you by

[Outro]
Don't you let nothing
Don't let no one take you away from love
Don't let real love pass you by
You'll see I know, I know, I know
You'll be alright
Don't let real love pass you by
You just gotta believe in love, in love, in love, in love
Don't let real love pass you by
Oh yeah
Don't let real love pass you by
Ooh, yeah
Don't let real love pass you by
Don't let, don't let, don't let, don't let
Don't let, don't let, don't let, don't let
Don't let real love pass you by
Oh yeah, oh
Don't let real love pass you by...

[Intro]
See the difference between me and you niggas
Is you niggas play too much
Me, I'm really gettin' to the money
It's a whole different ball game
I walk into the store and say, you know

[Chorus]
2k on my Balenciagas
I told lil mama I'm a shotta
2k but that's just for my riders
These bitches love me like Big Papa
2k on my Balenciagas

[Verse 1]
All these bitches love a nigga 'cause I'm out the T.O
Creole misses eatin' greo, bitches love my steelo
Heard your bitch was talkin', said I ain't no Al Pacino
Look her dead up in the face like what the fuck does she know?
I told Kels we out for clubbin', dreamin', touchin', sinos
Fuck these bitches, love to quote us on our money lingo
Walk inside the spot for nothin' under cinco
I walk inside the spot and hear the fuckin' bingo
Hopped up off the tour and popped up out the foreign
Y'all say you ballin' but who really out here scorin'?
When you was talkin' reckless, I was out there tourin'
And my brother Sosa, how did you know we about to go in?
But I be with it when the drama there
Niggas pull up on me playin' Gotti, gotta pocket rocket when I pop in there
Pop a op and cop a 100 niggas that be son’n niggas like they pop in there
A lot of niggas say they gettin' gwop but they be in the trap but really not in there
Y’all wouldn't never be caught in there
Shawty, gonna do it for Fargo, fuck it I wasted a line
I walk through the bank, never wait in a line
All you niggas, I'm rich, yeah I made up my mind
And I'm ballin', we from the islands but my whip is foreign
Closet worth half a million and that’s just in Jordans

[Interlude]
I don’t really like talkin'
It's like what you wanna do
You see these Balmain jeans, Balenciaga sneakers, rare J’s
It’s like, what you want me to do? I’m sorry

[Chorus]
2k on my Balenciagas
I told lil mama I'm a shotta
2k but that's just for my riders
These bitches love me like Big Papa
2k on my Balenciagas

[Verse 2]
Skinny black nigga with the icey watch
Walk inside my closet, see a Nike shop
I used to stack my hundreds in that Nike box
Now I only use that money to let wifey shop
I told you niggas
Don’t ask for nothin', I don’t know you niggas
You doubted, so I had to show you niggas
Word to lil Haiti, I might zoe you niggas
Don’t run up on me like you straight up, nigga
I'm a A1 nigga
Hit his celly, tellin' on you, that’s your day one nigga
I just move like the mob, keep a tool like a job

But I know he can see I'm with a 100 niggas, all us down to get this money in it
What to do when you need money in these streets and niggas dyin' tryina fuck and get it?

2k but that's just for my riders
These bitches love me like Big Papa
2k on my Balenciagas

2k on my Balenciagas

[Verse 1]
She said "How could you joke at a time like this?
I know why, cause this is what you wanted all along now, isn't it?
I think that all you ever really ever wanted was a reason to complain
That never stopped you before, don't let it get in your way"
Those are her words, not mine
As far as I'm concerned, we could've had a good time
So, if you walk out that door in disgust
I guess there's nothing more to discuss

[Chorus]
Birds don't sing, they just fall from the sky
Girls don't call, and they never tell you why
That's just how they say goodbye
Goodbye

[Samples from Dangerously Yours]
(Over and over again)
("Well, um...yes!")
("You'd do that to a woman?")
("You don't sound 'a little sick' to me.")

[Verse 2]
Don't listen to my music, don't lie in my bed
Don't listen to the references to things that you might have actually said
'Cause those are my words, not yours
As far as I'm concerned, it could have been a lot worse
I wasn't trying to avoid the confrontation
She isn’t crying, she’s just making conversation

[Chorus]
Birds don't sing, they just fall from the sky
Girls don't call, and they never tell you why
That's just how they say goodbye
Goodbye

[Samples from Dangerously Yours]
(Over and over again)
("Well, um...yes!")
("You'd do that to a woman?")

[Verse 1]
I can't carry the weight around baby
How could I have ever belonged?
Learnin' all my lessons, dangerous impressions
Pushed you right out of my world
I know that you and I have tried very hard to find a different result
But how can we be patient when we're always racin'
And no one’s ever there to hold
Any time you need a friend baby
I will be the one that you want
And if you're ever down and out baby
I will be there biggin' you up
And you can lean on me anytime baby
For anything you want and need
Oh I don't need a reason
Memory or a season
It's longer than always could be
And farther than the eyes can see

[Chorus]
Forever love
Oh forever love
Forever mine, forever yours
Forever love
Forever love
Oh it's forever love
Forever mine, forever yours
Forever love, forever love

[Bridge]
Impossible, impossible
It's possible, anything's possible

[Verse 2]
So come on over baby start the healin'
Let me get a good look at you
Cause I miss our discussion, whisperin' and blushin'
Secrets that only we know
And if you ever need a friend baby
I can be the one that you want
And if you’re ever down and out baby
I will be the one that you want
You can lean on me anytime baby
For anything you want and need
Oh I don't need a reason
Memory or a season
Everyday I will believe
That you and I were meant to be

[Chorus]
Forever love
Oh forever love
Forever mine, forever yours
Forever love
Forever love
Oh it's forever love
Forever mine, forever yours
Forever love

[Verse 3]
When you're broken, when you're blind
And you need someone to show you the light
I'll be right there baby
Holdin' you tight
Cause if you ever need a friend baby
I can be the one that you want
And if you’re ever down and out baby
I can be the one that you want
You can lean on me anytime baby
For anything you want and need
Oh I don’t need a reason
Memory or a season
Everyday I will believe
It’s longer than always could be
Oh it’s further than the eyes can see
More real than any dream could be
Oh you and I, you and I
You and I we were family

[Chorus]
Forever love
Oh forever love
Forever mine, forever yours
Forever love
Forever love
Oh it's forever love
Forever mine, forever yours
Forever love, forever love

[Chorus]
Touch me you’re my fantasy
My body’s yours, my heart is yours
Touch me you’re my fantasy
My night is yours, my love is yours
Touch me you’re my fantasy
My body’s yours, my heart is yours
Touch me you’re my fantasy
My night is yours, my love is yours
Touch me you’re my fantasy

[Verse 1]
Ooh baby I got a feeling we ain’t never going to be friends
Ooh baby I got a feeling tonight
Ooh baby I got a feeling we were lovers in a previous life
Ooh baby I got a feeling tonight
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I don’t know how you do it, working the way you are
Trying to be a mother, earner, lady and a star
I will always daydream wishing that you were mine
I understand right now you need some space and time
I can smell your perfume
Your legs are on my walls
Your body’s on my ceiling
Your giggle down the hall
I remember when I was the only one you’d call
Everything has changed, everything has changed
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Let it go, lights down low, you’re my fantasy
Here we go, the angels know you are my fantasy
Let it go, lights down low, you’re my fantasy
Here we go, only you are my fantasy

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(Can’t get too much of you babe
I’ll never make it without your love
Can’t get enough of you babe
I’ll never make it without your love)
Come back to me
Come home to me babe
Come on back to me
Pretty please darling

[Chorus]
What can I say, oh what can I do?
When I'm crazy, so crazy for you
I try not to show it, but I can't control it
I'm still madly crazy for you

[Verse 1]
See the birds fly, see the blue sky
See the best times of my life
Watch me crawl, watch me beg
Watch me fall deep, cause I
I just can't stop
I just can't stop thinkin' 'bout those days
Under sunshine, too much wine
Layin' in the grass, you were all mine
So free just like heaven, or what I expect
Heaven will be
Soaked up in love baby, just you and me

[Chorus]
What can I say, oh what can I do?
When I'm crazy, so crazy for you
I try not to show it, but just can't control it
I'm still madly crazy for you

[Verse 2]
Every night you'd close your eyes on my chest like it's home
And you'd say until that happened you just can't fall asleep
Without you layin' your head on me
But I was in chains in the rain, lost my soul, now you know
I'm so sorry you had to suffer my lack of self-control
You think by now I might've grown

[Chorus (alternate)]
What can I say, oh what can I do?
I'm crazy so crazy for you
I try not to show it, but my heart can't control it
I'm still madly crazy for you

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Still madly crazy for you

What can I say, oh what can I do?
I'm crazy so crazy for you
I try not to show it, but my heart just can't hold it
I'm still madly crazy for you

[Chorus]
Emergency, emergency
There’s a black tar cloud all because of me
Emergency (911), emergency (911)
There’s a black tar cloud (black tar)
All because of me (911)

[Verse 1]
(Tell ‘em the truth)
You’re packing up quickly, the baby’s at grandma's
The raging coast is far from clear (truth)
You’re yelling and screaming and smacking me
"How could you do this? You spoiled little rich kid" (truth)
A rock in the TV
You bashin' my ride up, you smashed my guitar
(Tell ‘em the truth)
Chasing me around the house
Swinging trying to hit me with my favorite golf club (truth)
You revved up the car
You smashed through the gate
I ran up the street (truth)
I waited an hour to cool off
When I came back it was too late (truth)
You were lying in bed (truth)
Said you took twenty pills (truth)
Now I’m calling the ambulance, police
I’m freakin' out till you said, "Chill baby
I didn't really take them pills
I’m just desperately crying for help"

[Chorus (alternate)]
(911) Emergency (911)
There’s a black tar cloud (black tar)
All because of me (911)
Aww emergency (911) yeah Emergency (911)
There’s a black tar cloud (black tar)
All because of me (911)

[Verse 2]
(Tell ‘em the truth)
I was licking your wounds
I thought we were straight (truth)
I thought everyone was gonna eat the chips
Turns out I’m the only one who double dipped (truth)
Face down in a puddle of shame (tell ‘em the truth)
Drowning in suffering, self-sabotaging
The one thing that always made life seem ok (truth)
I was jealous of your light, jealous of your soul
Good morning manipulation and control

[Chorus (alternate)]

[Bridge]
One heart was more than enough
One body wanted too much (truth)
One kiss it wanted to stay
One hand always misbehaved
(Tell ‘em the truth)
One eye looked around the room
One eye looked inside itself and finally (truth)
Finally saw the truth yeah
(Finally the truth)
Finally saw the truth
(Finally the truth)
Now the sun’s is going down yeah the sun’s going down
Ana all we got left baby is this black tar, black tar, black tar cloud

[Outro]
(911) Emergency (911) Emergency (911)
Emergency (911) Emergency (911)
Emergency (911) Emergency (911)
There’s a black tar cloud all cause of me me me me me me me
There’s a black tar cloud (black tar)
Can’t see through the clear (black tar)
There’s a black tar cloud (black tar) in both hemispheres (black tar)
There’s a black tar cloud (black tar) and I brought it here (black tar)
There’s a black tar cloud (black tar)
Oh emergency (911)

Me (Me), you (You), N (N), Y (Y)
Why not? (Why not?)
Why not? (Why not?)
Why not? (Why not?)
You’re way too young to dance like that in front of a man like me baby
Oh yes you are
You know cigarettes are bad for you baby
But so am I
So go out and get ‘em done
When you come back we’ll have so much fun
With your new nails on my back
You be scratching and scratching my itch
With your new nails on my back
Something’s broken only you can fix
With your new new new new new new new nails
Sweet cherry pineapple black
Shine your magical touch and heavenly light on my body baby
Show me our love can grow back

Show me show me show me baby
With your new nails on my back

Ohh I like the way you light all the candles and dance in front of the TV ooh extra slow
Giving me those eyes over your shoulder baby
Like the sun and the rain you make everything everything around you grow
So go out and get ‘em done When you come back we’ll have so much fun
With your new nails on my back
You be scratching and scratching my itch
With your new nails on my back something’s broken only you can fix
With your new new new new new new new nails
Passion fruit three inches stacked
Shine your rainbow of hope and hot pot of gold on my body baby
Show me our love can grow back
The world can be such a lonely place
Sometimes you need a new drug

Sweet love can leave such a bitter taste
Sometimes you just need a hug
Every time I see your gorgeous face
You get me on the right track
Keep me on the right track
And show me our love can grow back

[Intro]
Too little too late, too little too late
Too little too late, too little too late

Every time you walked through that door
I should’ve held you so long you would never ever need to ask for more

[Verse 1]
Every time you walked through that door
I should’ve spun you around and around like the kitchen was the dance floor
Every time you walked through that door
Should’ve listened fixed it kissed it healed it not belittled it
Every time you walked up in this house baby
Should’ve made you feel special and treated you right

[Chorus]
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Don’t you say it baby
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Don’t you say it say it say it now
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
I’m down on my knees baby
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Baby baby please

[Post-Chorus]
(Too little too late, too little, too late)
No, no, no, no, no
(Too little too late, too little, too late)
(Too little too late, too little, too late)
I love you baby
(Too little too late, too little, too late)

[Verse 2]
Every time you walked through that door
Should’ve bought white roses good and plenty and rubbed your toes
Every time you walked up in this house baby
Shoulda woulda coulda
Should’ve shown some R-E-S-P-E-C-T

[Chorus (alternate)]
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Don’t you say it baby
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Don’t you say it say it say it right now
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Don't say it's too late
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Baby baby please

[Post-Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Every time you walk through that door
Should’ve waited patient thanked you spanked you pleased you feed you
Every time you walked up in this house baby
Should’ve cheered you feared you knew a day would never come when I don’t need you

[Outro]
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Don't say it's too late
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Don't you leave me, leave me, leave me lonely
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Don't say it's too late
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Oh my lord
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
I get down on my knees
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
I'm begging you please baby
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
I will if you wait for me baby
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Baby baby please
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
No, no, no, no
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
No don't you say it
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
I love you baby
Baby baby please

[Verse 1]
Well she hears her favorite song
Screams at her friends
Jumps on the couch
Takes another sip
Man when you see her you’ll be standing with an open mouth
Cause she’s the Eiffel tower and she’s new in town

[Chorus]
She be dancin’ on her tippy toes
Her tippy toes
Dancin’ on her tippy toes
Her tippy toes
Everywhere my baby goes
Its tippy toes
Dancin' on her tippy tippy tippy tippy toes
Dancin' on her toes
Dancin' on her toes (Tippy toes)
Dancin' on her tippy toes
Her tippy toes (Tippy toes)
Now everywhere my baby goes
Is tippy toes (Tippy toes)
Dancin' on her tippy tippy toes

[Verse 2]
She’s a feather from a dove in a gust of wind
On her own in the clouds, never has to land
Right now is the day when her story begins
She’s the leader of the movement of the heart and hips

[Verse 3]
Straight A’s, good girl, loves her mom and dad
She ain’t greedy, but she wants so much more than she has
When she looks in the mirror she can love herself
Cause she doesn’t want to be like anybody else

[Verse 4]
And when the world, when the world comes a tumbling down
She’ll change your clothes to a smile when you’re wearing a frown
Can I please have your attention, people gather ‘round
Cause she’s the northern lights and she’s new in town

[Chorus]

She’s sweet like the beginning and the end of summer
Little kisses on your face make you wanna love her
Never walks, only skips, sashays and struts
She can twerk, but she’d rather dip, bounce it, and bust
She hears her favorite song
Screams at her friends Jumps on the couch
Takes another sip
Man when you see her you’ll be staring with an open mouth
Cause she’s the Mona Lisa and she’s new in town

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Angel eyes, angel eyes, angel eyes on the floor
Angel eyes, angel eyes, angel eyes at my door
Angel eyes, angel eyes, angel eyes in my bed
Angel eyes, angel eyes, only you in my head
Angel eyes, angel eyes having so much fun
Angel eyes, angel eyes always on the run
Angel eyes, angel eyes if you open ‘em wide
You will see you should be tippy toeing with me

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]
There’s something bad in me
(Something, something)
Ah, there’s something bad in me
(something, something)
Yeah there’s something bad, something bad, something real real bad
(Something, something)
There’s something ba-ba-ba-bad in me (bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad)

[Chorus]
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) Aww yeah
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) I've been so bad
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) Oh yeah, I've been so bad baby, bad baby
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) I've been so bad
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby)

[Verse 1]
In my blood in my veins something’s got me by the reigns
Try to run but I’ve been staring down the barrel of a gun
A liar under pressure feeling mighty dressed up
Look at me I’m showing off again ‘cause vanity’s my only friend
I’m in pieces of a puzzle if you ever even finish babe it won’t be worth the muscle
But take a leap of faith and baby land in my bed
But don’t you be surprised if I end up messing up your head There’s something bad in me

[Pre-Chorus] + 

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
She’s a princess but not from kings and queens
Pink Lips on my fingers ears and ankles
I’m a fiend
Beautiful secrets that nobody’s supposed to keep
A bird flew in the window took a picture and left with a naughty tweet
I try to be deep before I do bad things
But it feels so good right now how wrong could this be
I know you wanna fly so baby open up your wings
Then I’ll walk out with your legs shaking while you’re screaming Robin please

[Pre-Chorus] + 

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I’m in pieces of a puzzle
If you ever put together won’t be worth the years of trouble
With me you’ll wanna do things for the very first time
Tonight I’m all yours but in the morning
I’m all mine

[Pre-Chorus]

[Outro]
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) Aww yeah
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) I've been so bad
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) Oh, I've been so bad
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) Oh, I'm such a bad baby, bad baby
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) I'm so bad baby, yeah
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) Forgive me baby
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) Forgive me baby
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) I've been such a bad baby, yeah
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) Oh, forgive me baby
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) Don't say it's too late
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) Forgive me baby

And all that she needed was a true friend
All she received was a troubled man

And I just rewarded her with my drunken rants
And all that she needs is a good man (Doo-doo-doo)
All that she needs is another try (Doo-doo-doo)
All that she needs is something that I couldn't give her (Doo-doo-doo)

This is the time of your life
Let's celebrate, not ask each other why
She’s standing there beside you
Touch her hand let it guide you
She’s just looking for somebody to love

[Verse 1]
This is the moment of your life
Everything’s changed it all gonna turn out right
We don’t know how this little fairy tale ends
Good thing we will always be best friends
Well this is the time of your life
Live it up drink it down
Get up off the ground, take flight
If you practice the right moves
Maybe you’ll see
Everything fits so perfectly
It’s the time of your life, yes it is

[Pre-Chorus]
She wants to know if everybody’s looking
She doesn’t know that she’s got that thing
She wants to know if anybody’s looking
She doesn’t realize

You got that thing baby (you got it got it)
You got that thing baby (you got it got it)
You got that thing baby (you got it got it)

Special and wonderful, you got it in your soul

But I think as they say in Hollywood you got that it baby

[Bridge: Akon]
Call 'em, call 'em call 'em
Somebody better call 'em, call 911
Call da police for me, tell them it's a case of emergency
Bum bye bye what I see your streets
Killa song boy, emcees get murda

[Hook: Akon]
Call da police for me, tell them it's a case of emergency
Call 'em, call 'em call da police on me
Tell 'em it's a case of emergency
Call 'em, call 'em, call 'em

[Verse 1: Akon]
Yeah, all these niggas be strapping up
But they will be the one to be running
Same nigga wanna come back me up
And be actin' tough and be punchin'
Got a tool that'll back back you up
And we'll reach from here to London
Bigger than the mac mac mac 10
Say hello to master cannon
In case of emergency you need to just call 'em, call 'em
Everybody got that thing, the infrared beam
And I suggest call 'em, call 'em
Cause when I'm in black, I'm really hard to be seen
You need to just call 'em, call 'em
I blend with the night, yeah that's right
I'm so anonymous, call 'em, call 'em
Shawty you could just call me, when you wanna come on me
I'm the one you wanna call on to, caress you when you get lonely
Now I know why you on me, baby daddy so horny
Come on right, well this bad man, even da police man can't hold me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Neighbors always call the police on me
When they hear me coming out
Cause when I spit I sound like 1000 drummers and a marching band coming, dibid dabidibi dibidibidi, hear that drum roll along with the music
Niggas always step to me and say they heard if I can spit like a drum roll do it
When I'm up and coming and I put it down my nigga then you see the police coming
Want to shut it down my nigga then you see me going hard want to count up on your fingers
They don't wanna let me go cause I'm gonna never stop killing
And I know it and I keep it going till I really beat them in a flow and then you see me throwing
Till I got them giving me the dough see the way we do it niggas gonna be showin how to blow it
Everytime I get the opportunity that I know
Here we go again we got a number one and I'm gonna kill it then I'm gonna have a little fun
And I'm gonna drill it in your head until the parties done
If your really here well I suggest u probably better run
It's an emergency, promise you don't wanna go against me
Most incredible to ever bless a microphone even when they call police on me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Akon]
Call the police, you fucking with a beast
Check my record I kill these niggas hide up in belief
Murda, murda, I did it did it in the first degree
Man down, somebody better call rere
Really got to be boom boom C
Show me what you got for me
And Verse Simmonds
Every time I come around she be popping it like 3 ladies
One me 3 ladies, all these bottles I'm faded
Woke up this morning man I just thank the lord that I made it
Got a million clothes, a million hoes
A million dollars from a million shows
I stack it all up, I spend it on clothes
And if you don't know you on that flow
Knick the shot, ain't it hot?
Ain't it hot? I hear they shootin' and somebody call the cops

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Outro: Akon]
Call 'em call 'em

Trigga babe

[Verse 1]
Wish I lost the keys to my Rover
Wish I lost the number to my chauffeur
But she begging me to come over
Even though I know I shouldn't go over
I'm on my way to her place
Am I ever gon' learn my lesson?
All these sins disguised as blessings

[Pre-Chorus]
Never felt we'd kiss and tell our private conversations
I know damn well I'll go through hell from falling for your temptations
She said let her go, she said let her go
So what I do better now?
She said pull it now, but don't pull it out
So what I do? Sweat it out

[Chorus]
Man, I'm too old for this shit, man, I'm too grown for this shit
If I want it, I'ma go get it, this is all too familiar
Man, I'm too old for this shit, man, I'm too grown for this shit
If I want it, I'ma go get it, I'm a serial killer
I'm a killer, I'm a killer
I'm a killer, I'm a killer

[Verse 2]
Wish I wasn't on your wish list
Now I'm unwrapping you like Christmas
Wish I was a little stronger mentally
Then I wouldn't be so weak physically
Having my way below your waist
Am I ever gon' learn my lesson?
All these sins disguised as blessings

[Pre-Chorus]
Never felt we'd kiss and tell our private conversations
I know damn well I'll go through hell from falling for your temptations
She said let her go, she said let her go
So what I do better now?
She said pull it now, but don't pull it out
So what I do? Sweat it out

Man, I'm too old for this shit, man, I'm too grown for this shit
If I want it, I'ma go get it, this is all too familiar

[Bridge]
Swear it's so crazy that every night
I love a new woman up in my life
She's seen some dope shit that she's never seen
I give her dope then 'cause she's just a fiend
Woman I love, why don't you leave me?
It may be hard, but it's never easy
Girl, why you trust me, why you believe me?
You should say fuck me, girl you don't need me
I'm always on some other shit
Paying more attention to the one I'm going home with
Am I gon' change? I don't know if I'm strong enough to ever let it go
If you stick around 'til I'm out, no matter who it is, girl, I'll always know it

[Pre-Chorus]
Never felt we'd kiss and tell our private conversations
I know damn well I'll go through hell from falling for your temptations
She said let her go, she said let her go
So what I do better now?
She said pull it now, but don't pull it out
So what I do? Sweat it out

[Chorus]
Man, I'm too old for this shit, man, I'm too grown for this shit
If I want it, I'ma go get it, this is all too familiar
Man, I'm too old for this shit, man, I'm too grown for this shit
If I want it, I'ma go get it, I'm a serial killer
I'm a killer, I'm a killer
I'm a killer, I'm a killer

Grab that shit, you can have that shit
Dope dick doctor, I’ma give you a prescription

See she the candy lady I'm the candy Mane
She got 3 blocks on her call her candy cane
Like my Glock 9 I keep her right beside me
First I make her drive then I let her ride me

Brand new Gucci bag with a pocket scale
Plus she bust open the bags with her finger nails
She got carats on her wrist and diamonds on her neck
She in my drop top vet thumbing through the check

She say money make her cum, trapping make her wet
Every time we have sex I try to make her sweat
I keep her with some work and keep her in a skirt
We love blowing kush, stay blowing purp

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
See she the type of girl that a nigga like
And she'll jump off she'll help a nigga fight
She more than a lover she more like a sister
I buy her a bag she buy me a pistol

And what you call that I call it homecookin'
See that's my old lady she drive me crazy
But the homies in hood call her the candy lady

Baby girl 100 she don't do no faking
Brought my girl a bag then she brought me back a AR
Baby girl 100 she don't do no faking
Brought my girl a bag then she brought me back a AR

[Verse 2: Wooh Da Kid]
Now she the kinda girl that a nigga like
Always beat it up so she call me Ike
Candy lady take the niggas out the candy land
She got you spending all your money like a ceiling fan

Glock .45 fully loaded clip
Don't think that she gon' pull it if she let it rip
She say she like my chain she want the same thing
First she got the bird with the pink rings

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
See she the type of girl that a nigga like
And she'll jump off she'll help a nigga fight
She more than a lover she more like a sister
I buy her a bag she buy me a pistol

It's early in the morning she water whippin'
And what you call that I call it homecookin'
See that's my old lady she drive me crazy
But the homies in hood call her the candy lady

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Busting up in this bitch, Flocka need a bad bitch
One night stand baby we can have a maverick
Green chain cabbage, lil' shawty not your average
Light, fake, cute, oh my god
Jump in my car I can make you a star
My swag to the roof, Waka Flame be the truth
Got goons that's gon' shoot, tag your man in body bag
All that flirting can a nigga stab that

She say she digging me, she say she feeling me
I'm so fucking hot I burned her to the 3rd degree
He so industry, I'm so fucking hood
Blowing purple tree and it taste so fucking good

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Frenchie]
Baby girl my sister, better off my best friend
Cause if I hop up on a nigga bet she jumping in
Fuck a nickel bag. kilo she shifting in
I ask her for 5 pounds but she bring me 10

That's why I follow her she don't want tilapia
Just give her a cheeseburger and promise not to lie to her

[?] in the South before I got knocked
She'll get money from all of my side bitchs to bail a nigga out

That's why I call her my main squeeze, fittna drop with that cool breeze
When I see her I freeze I like to watch her like HD
Yeah that's my baby no Beyonce and Jay-Z
Cause she walk up on you and rock-a-bye baby

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I never wanted anything but this
I worked hard, tried hard
I ran around in domestic bliss
I fought hard, died long

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Every time you're running out of here
Every time you're running I get the fear

[Verse 2]
I never wanted any broken bones
Scarred face, no home
Your words surround me and asphyxiate
And I burn all hate

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Every time you're running out on me
Every time you're running I can see

[Chorus]
I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feeds me
I will not control myself

[Bridge]
The waters spray, the waters run all over me
The waters spray, the waters run
And this time you're gonna pay

[Chorus]
I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feeds me
I will not control myself

[Intro: Bo Burnham & Teen in the audience]
How old are you, buddy?
(14)
14? Is this your mother beside you?
(mumbling)
This is getting awkward isn't it?
Well your mother's very cool... your mother's very cool for bringing you
Remember that, remember when you get old and grey
And- and she was cool she brought you to a comedy show
I have trouble getting along with my father, he's such a man's man you know
He lives his life by all these rules that I can't possibly live by
Like he believes you should always fight fire with fire
Which is a horrible way to live your life
Well cause he's a firefighter and he was fired
Whoops, that was stupid, let's get a little stupider

[Verse: Bo Burnham]
There's a creepy old man fishing in the park, and the only problem is
He tied a candy bar to the end of his line, he's trying to catch a kid

[Skit: Bo Burnham & Girl in the audience]
Haha, haha
For those listening on the CD, I mimed like I was catching the 14 year old I was just talking to
Mom isn't happy, just guessing, not even looking, alright
You know, people complain about the way I act on stage, they think I repeat jokes. And they think- They don't get that the way I act on stage is just that, it's an act. You know, they think on stage I act too arrogant, too self-obsessed, solipsistic, self-contained, synonyms. And they want me to be- they want me to be more a comic to the people, relate to the beautiful people in this room in the overarching glue of comedy, so let's do a little but of uh relatable comedy
I'm like you guys, once a week I like to slip into a deep existential depression and where I lose all my sense of oneness and self worth, haha!
And what I like to do in order to assure myself that I am unique, and I'm not just one of many small, white indistinguishable perfectly cylindric checker pieces in Jesus and Satan's backgammon game
Is I will- guys, I'll try to say a group of words in a certain order that I think no one has ever said them before, so when I'm saying them it's like"Look at me, participating in this new moment that no one has ever participated in" and I feel like I'm preceding out of the abyss so I'll say something random that no one's ever said, like "peanut butter tribadism," or "I'm your father and I loved your comedy show," or "At first I didn't feel comfortable leaving him alone with my child, but then I saw his mustache, phew."
Or, uh, or, uh, "Did you see this Amish website?"
Or "Hey yo baby my life's about three things, three simple things, gettin' money, gettin' pussy, and the Dewey decimal system"
Or um, "Hey can you hold my fanny pack? I'm gonna go fuck a woman"
You just don't hear 'em
(Cheers from the audience)
I'm giving you attention, girl that's wooing, are you happy now?
(I love you!)
You love me, that's nice. You love the idea of me, you don't know me but that's okay
It's called a parasocial relationship
It goes one way and it's ultimately destructive. But please, keep buying all my shit forever

[Outro: Bo Burnham]
That's how it works. Capitalism, I'm trapped. It's terrible, I'm a horrible person, alright

[Chorus]
Let's get it crunk up on
Have fun up on up in this dancery

So just dance for me

[Verse 1]
Oh, the sand keeps falling through the hourglass
And there's no way you're gonna slow it down
You say we gotta treasure each moment
Who knows how long we're gonna be around?

Yeah, you keep on telling me life is short
And it's hard to disagree with what you say
But if time is so precious, why are you wasting mine?
Cause I'm always reading, always deleting
Every useless piece of garbage you send my way

[Chorus]
Every stupid hoax, all those corny jokes
Stop forwarding that crap to me
Well I don't need tons of cringe-inducing puns
Stop forwarding that crap to me

No, it isn't okay if you brighten my day
With some cut-and-pasted, hackneyed Hallmark poetry
And I didn't request a personality test
Stop forwarding that crap to me

[Verse 2]
You're sending virus-laden, bandwidth-hogging attachments
To every single person you know
You're passing around a link to some dumb thing on YouTube
That everybody else already saw 3 years ago

And wacky, badly photoshopped billboards
Were never that amusing to me
And I just can't believe you believe those urban legends
But I have high hopes someone'll point you toward Snopes
And debunk that crazy junk you're spewing constantly

[Chorus]
No, I don't want a bowl of Chicken Soup for the Soul
Stop forwarding that crap to me
Send more top 10 lists and I'll slash my wrists
Please stop forwarding that crap to me

Well, I'm sorry I can't accept your paranoid rant
And I don't want the Neiman Marcus cookie recipe
Won't you kindly refrain? Because it's hurting my brain
Stop forwarding that crap to me

[Bridge]
Like glittery hearts and unicorns
And pictures of somebody's cat
Now tell me, in what alternate reality
Would I care about something like that?
Oh, and by the way, your quotes from George Carlin aren't really George Carlin
Mister Rogers never fought the Viet Cong
And Bill Gates is never gonna give me something for nothing
And I highly doubt some dead girl's gonna kill me
If I don't pass your letter along

[Chorus]
Now I know you're wishing that I'll sign your petition
But stop forwarding that crap to me
And I don't wanna read your series of conspiracy theories
Just stop forwarding that crap to me

And your two million loser friends all have my address now
Because you never figured out the way to BCC
Now, I gotta insist, take me off your list
Stop forwarding that crap to me

[Outro]
Stop forwarding that crap to me
Stop forwarding that crap to me
Stop forwarding that crap to me

Stop forwarding that crap to me (Just stop it now)
Stop forwarding that crap to me (Oh, no)
Stop forwarding that crap to me (Oh, whoa)
Stop forwarding that crap to me (I can't take it)
Stop forwarding that crap to me (Oh, please)
Stop forwarding that crap to me

Stop forwarding that crap to me (You gotta stop)
Stop forwarding that crap to me (Right now)
Stop forwarding that crap to me

Stop forwarding that crap to me (I'm not kidding)
Stop forwarding that crap to me

At the risk of being slightly repetitious
Im gonna ask you now to stop (Stop)
Sending me that crap
I don't want it, don't send it to me
No, don't send it to me

Stop forwarding that crap to me (Just stop)
Stop forwarding that crap to me (Whoa)
Stop forwarding that crap to me
To me
Ahh, ahh, ahh

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Paranoid as a child, blessed to be a dreamer
Bitch we dem boyz, nigga we the Beatles
1-8-7, no appeal, get it how you live
Before I go broke, accountants jump off a bridge
First round draft pick, hittas stay in the field
On that poor side of town, grinding to pay our bills
They hate to see you flourish, so I draw the curtains
I'm so high up in the sky, that my i won't get no service
Democracy be the dope, community in the choke
The warden just caught his case, he was looking forward to vote
Nigga count your blessings, lighters on the dresser
I scoped it, a whole body, so yes I'm well invested

[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
From Figueroa to the airport to them Iceland hoes
Head to London then to Paris, double sold out shows
Then I fell asleep in my Saint-Laurent and woke up to stunt more
And just recent nigga, my teeth is nickel, got disco-ball glow, uh
Niggas throwin' shots but I dodge 'em all, you can't touch this
Don't believe if my name involved in some punk shit, uh, yeah
Half a mil a week, a crib by the beach and got bank roll
Got a bitch who got booty cheeks and good neck though
Hold up, hol' up, hol' up, this game we play, you can't control us
Hol' up, hol' up, they knew us cause the way we pulled up
Hold up, hol' up, my bitch, her shape like Coca-Cola
Hold up, hol' up, Wiz on joints, my woods be rolled up

I never give a rat a pass, it's the fattest ass that attracts me
How do I define Nasty? Ghastly, explain Esco
Plain and simple, with a redbone in the Benzo sippin' XO
From the Don to God's Son, the Project Prophet, the live one
The father of Destiny, Knight’s pops, Will’s man
Jungle's brother, girl, I house you like the Jungle Brothers
Understand, I shine before ya'll time
I been outside when T La Rock invented rhymes
When dinner time and BBS’s on tinted Saab’s was getting robbed
I'm 20 in, still outside, don't ask for it
That parched up from here on, that half moon is that Nas cut
We been 'em niggas that's been them niggas, ask any nigga
Mass Appeal, HSTRY, Henny sippers, let's get it nigga

Look, we gotta stay fresh playboy, yeah, yeah
Ain't nothing you could do about it, we dem boyz, uhh

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Keys to my estate, put the cheese inside a safe
Drinkin' by the case, that be the reason why they hate
Fresh up out a cell to the seats of private planes
Roll at least an ounce a day, smokin' weed is my escape
Peddle to the floor, make sure my niggas straight
Every city-state, I'm tryna break the piggie bank
Some niggas get put on, some niggas get played
Take another selfie, watch my lawyer beat the case
We dem boyz

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Hol' up, hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up, we dem boyz
Hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise

Uh, word to Ricardo Tisci
She like, "Oh my God," I’m like, "Nice to meet me"
Damn, girl, you got that Versace

Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Now my mascara running, red lipstick smudged
Oh he so horny, yeah he want to fuck
He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse
He Monica Lewinsky-ed all on my gown

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Oh there, daddy, daddy didn’t bring the towel
Oh, baby, baby, we better slow it down
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Take all of me, I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like
Take all of me, I just wanna be the girl you like
The kinda girl you like is right here with me

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
Driver, roll up the partition fast
Driver, roll up the partition fast
Over there, I swear I saw them cameras flash
Hand prints and footprints on my glass
Hand prints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blasting
He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty
Red wine drip, we’ll talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdropping trying not to crash

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Oh there, daddy, daddy didn’t bring the towel
Oh, baby, baby, we better slow it down
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club

[Intro]
Young Chop on the beat
Your time Scooter, turn up

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
My life is a jugg, my momma, she jugg
I own the word jugg, juggs got me fooled
Rest in peace to Lante, he died making the jugg
Free my nigga Tay, he made sure, the whole hood good
I met my nigga Gucci Mane, I was making the jugg
They gave me jugger of the year cause I jugg so good
You can't jugg, jugg-man, I cut off your hand
I'll jugg you out your bands, and switch phones on your ass

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I woke up in Juggland, what a great feeling
House full of Mexicans, nothing but drug dealing
Mi casa su casa Vato!, that's a jugg house
RIP Griselda Blanco, that's a jugg house
100 kilo, thank the chapo, that's a jugg house
We got 18 carat fully autos at the jugg house
Jugg house, jugg house

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Mi casa su casa brotha
No bother cook powder brotha
We mix work like Spinderella
Black brick, white brick, salt and pepper
Yellow Maz and mozzarella
Shook house push three tons a day
While Molly sayin' who wanna get, we on the street but on the beat
Ran off on him I used my feet, Atlanta Hawks, Miami Heat
These Christian Lubs cost thirty-three
That's thirteen times your twenty-three
I still can cook the dope, remember the shit just like my A-B-C's
A-B-C, nigga, 1-2-3 - that 3-2-1 with a M-16

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fredo Santana]
Billion everyday, everyday's a jugg
Juggin' everyday, gotta meet my plug
Hit the trap up, make sure my work is good
Run off with that work, get left in the woods
Finessin' you out your work, get robbed in my hood
Drivin' real dirty tryna make a couple juggs
30's and F-Ns all under my hood
Got my money all in my pocket, you reach for it I'm poppin'
Ballin' like those stuntin, shooters with me, they thirsty
They ain't miss shit, they murkin'
They hittin' shit on purpose
I'm with Guwop, Scoot, and niggas nervous
Hoes damn see my horses
Your bitch want me, can't afford it
Kill a nigga for my fortune
Your bitch want me, can't afford it
I'll kill a nigga for my fortune
300 shit man...

[Intro:]
If you know me know this ain't my feng shui
Certified everywhere, ain't gotta print my resume
Talking crazy, I pull up andele
R.I.P to Nate Dogg, I had to regulate

Public Service Announcement
Where all my rich niggas at man?
MIGO!

[Hook: Takeoff]
Broke niggas stand to the left
My rich niggas stand to the right
Lil' mamma, she keep looking at me (lil' mama!)
Im'a knock the pussy out like fight night
Hit it with the left, hit with the right
Im'a knock the pussy out like fight night
Beat it with the left, beat it with the right
Im'a knock the pussy out like fight night

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Pack the pussy out, Pacquiao
Put a pussy in his place, throw it like a paper route
Pussy on a stand, my bitch'll never testify
We ain't never vibe, like the mag it's all blurred lines
Who the fuck wanted pussy? Punch you in your good eye
Go the all time, role with me then it's genocide
Poor bitches down to ride, big booty, tender lines
All whip, they never lies (?)
I pastor, I'm the reverend now
Young Jones, Spike Lee with this king shit
Tap the face, Mike Tyson, real Tyga in the crib
Shit, sitting on sixes, I started this king shit
This the motherfuckin' thanks I get? Bitch

[Hook:]

[Bridge:]
If you know me know this ain't my feng shui

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
If you know me know this ain't my feng shui
Certified everywhere, ain't gotta print my resume
Talking crazy, I pull up andele
R.I.P to Nate Dogg, I had to regulate
Pocket rocket fire, watch him disintegrate
It's a truckload coming on the interstate
Sirloin steak all on my dinner plate
Your main bitch say she wanna make a sex tape
Rich nigga, I could never be a broke nigga (rich nigga)
Broke niggas I can never get along with them!
Always been hated since a little nigga (always)
It's forever pussy nigga gotta deal with it (rich nigga!)

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Float like a butterly, sting like a bee
Rumble young nigga rumble!
Lil' mamma want a nigga like me in the sheets
Ice cube knock it out like Deebo
Now who's that talking that gangsta shit?
Somebody gonna kick your ass
When I walk up in the club I better make a thunderstorm
Let them know that this a whole lot of cash
Rich niggas on the right all night (rich nigga)
Broke niggas to the left by yourself (brokanese)
Now who the hell just said that the roof on fire?
Call 911 like Wyclef

[Hook:]

[Verse 1]
No crickets, no creatures are a-stirring
On the last night of the Chinese Year
I need a warm hand over the water
Ever since I lost mine in the fireworks disaster
And I lay up wide awake

[Refrain]
Going to take my life
Going to take my life back one day

[Verse 2]
Now, I'm watching you changing in the mirror
And I, unable to move
When all my girlfriends appear in the doorway
I don't know how they got here
I don't know what to say about this
And they all go that way

[Refrain]
Going to take my life
Going to take my life back one day

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I gotta talk to my lady
I don’t know why, but lately
Seem like she don’t love me no more, love me no more
She flipped the script on me, one-eighty
Oh, now  baby, why you acting like that for? Like that for?
She got me thinking about it
And I’m tryna figure out what did I do?
Or is she cheating on me and she’s falling in love with du'?

[Bridge: T-Pain]
But she talk to me in a week, and I’m losing my mind
But if she don’t care about commitment

[Hook: T-Pain]
She won’t mind if I commit love suicide
If I commit love suicide
She won’t mind if I commit love suicide
If I commit love suicide
She won’t mind

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
We need to talk, really really
Kill this relationship quickly
This ain’t gonna work no more, work no more
Go 'head and walk, get the hell out
Me and you, we done fell out
I don’t wanna hurt no more, hurt no more
She got me thinking about it
And I’m tryna figure out where I went wrong
Cause all she do is party, party, party
In the club rockin’ all night long

[Hook x2: T-Pain]

[Verse 3: Severe]
I be going insane, shawty jump around like she House of Pain
Type to have you thinking about blowing out your brains
Gettin' the gas, lightin' the matches, then your whole house in flames
Yeah, I’m tripping I suppose
Knowing I ain’t supposed to be tripping on these hoes
Knowing I could have any bitches doing shows
If I scream “Who is that?” watch the bitches hit the floor
They say that I’m the dude
The girls think I’m trippin’, they say that I’m a fool
Missing all the fun, stressin’ over you
Got me so disgusted, I don’t know what to do
Now I’m on the edge, feeling terrible inside
The way I feel is too unbearable to hide
Got me jumping off the cliff, middle finger to the sky
Screaming “Fuck you and I”

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Outro: T-Pain]
She won’t mind if I commit love suicide

Rolling up the thrax watch the police watch me (stop!)
I'm just too hot-ski came up on the front street
BCNGP

[?] all mine behind me
Zone 6 you find me probably testing diamonds
See how I'm ryhming that's why I'm shining
Time after time man I must remind him
I'm the king of diamonds and mines cost the mostest
Fucking the hostess we just elope bitch
Sold all my dope and I bought me 3 boats trick

[Hook]
Behind door one:
There's three things: greed, fortune, and fame
Door two:
You might be happy but nobody know your name
Door three:
The bacon got you squatting naked by the razor fence
Door four:
You on the bench and got the drugs inside your favorite Tims

Cause on the road to riches, there ain't no time for getting sidetracked
Pump in the trunk if you frontin' punkin' you lie flat -
Down on the pavement
Diamond laser engraved it
Wasting all of my time and then wondering where my days went
I'm 26 but still I'm feeling like a senior
I'm only two years removed from leaning in the beamer now
Some friends ain't friends no more, I guess they jealous
Problems with baby mama constantly been like a relish to my
Neck fresh on the set live in the flesh
Rhymin the best
Yo,,Bronsolini fans see hymen and breast
Talking sushi grade
My flow is linen and the shoes are suede
The wooden cutting board is right where the prosciutto laid
That's for the first course
The core burst off and hail
We'll be in hell but nobody trying to see the cell
Tonight we living life until we say goodnight
Breathe on the mic my flow knock the knees of a knight

My time always the right time
I'm surfing getting wavy
Like Hawaiians on the pipeline, I'm never in my right mind
Zagat rated thirty foot decor
The food and service
Hey the blow is chopped up on the plate yo peace to Curtis
Never nervous cause I'm ready
Went from leaning in the German now we swerving in the Chevy
Artichokes cover spaghetti
Can't begin to fathom how I pair the words and form the sentences
Pierre Cardere described in bold print on the lenseses
One leaf, half of the dutch combat the cancer
Peace to Elton John cause in the jacket got the tiny dancer
Ready to tango
Extra clips inside the pouch just like the creature on the Kangol
Paint that precious shit like Van Gogh
Mango, that's for the lassi
I love when bitches sassy
Slutty nasty, and let me smash it in the taxi
Then I give her a german brunch
And now she turning stunts
Since 16 six times a day I'm burning blunts

I wanna live the life the twenty beamers gleaming shorty steaming rice
And then the fluff all burnt my penis shoot the semen twice in the face
Flyest of steaks, got my eyes on the papes
Rhyme butter lake you know my grading be prime on the steak
Aged to perfection, that's how I like the vino
We rolling ceelo
Throw like Marino
Cruise in the Regal
In overdrive like my libido
I'm stroking like I'm Michael Phelps into the pussy fetal
It's Bronsolino
Just light the dutch up
Leather loaf and mash the clutch up
We getting fucked up
I make the motherfucker beam a 

[?] up
Hellish capers and now I'm scoring more than Celtic Lakers
Kicking like Messi now we overlooking gorgeous acres
In my defense, it's like the '85 Bears
There's no jail tales
Poetry in motion like I'm Gale Sayers
Before Maguire took his first needle
Yo, we been looking fly and faucet fiends in corners in the bird fetal -
Positioning I know you hear me but not listening
We glistening I rock a jacket made for fishermen
The buccaneer for nutritional and a buck of deer
Create a hash vat and bake it off, cut a square
Ton of flair like Rick I hold the pick
And plus I smoke a stick of heavy marijuana when I pose for flick
Get off the dick because we busting now
And when we come we eating crepes, you know we order up a dozen now

[Intro: Sevyn Streeter]
Shawty swing it my way
What you waiting for baby?
Are you gonna take it?
Won’t you please swing it my way
Shawty swing it my way

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I was out on the town, whipping and swinging
Got my head on a swivel ‘cause niggas be scheming
I had just got off the phone, my partner told me “be easy”
It ain’t got no definition, we just all know the meanings
I pull up to the spot, told the valet to leave it
Runned into a little cutie she look like Jennifer Freeman
A couple feet to my right, i could see she was speaking
I couldn’t hear what she was saying ‘cause the DJ was screaming

[Pre-Hook 1: B.o.B]
So I walked over to her slowly, she don’t smoke and she don’t drink
Well you gon’ fail your drug test ‘cause all I got is dope D
I know you don’t know me, but you could be my only
She whispered in my ear and this is what she told me

[Hook: Sevyn Streeter]
Shawty swing it my way
What you waiting for baby?
Are you gonna take it?
Won’t you please swing it my way
Shawty swing it my way
Shawty
If you’re feeling how I’m feeling then probably
There’s a million ways that we can get it started
I’m feeling so naughty
So, swing it over here shawty

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
They say it’s better to give than it is to receive it
That’s why I give her all I got, my bad for overachieving
Get your ass out them secrets from Victoria’s Secret
Back and forth with those lips, now that’s a verbal agreement
You say your man out of season, he probably cheating
That booty the dumbest, but that head is a genius
You could check out the stroll, you swear I was skiing
Fell asleep in that pussy, woke up, thought I was still dreaming

[Pre-Hook 2: B.o.B]
But then she pull me close and cozy, she don’t smoke and she don’t drink
Well you gon’ fail your drug test ‘cause all I got is dope D
I know you don’t know me, but you could be my only
She whispered in my ear and this is what she told me

[Hook: Sevyn Streeter]

[Outro: Sevyn Streeter and B.o.B, Union]
You looking good shawty, good, sure enough, good enough for me (x3)
You looking good shawty
So bring it over to me

[Outro: Sevyn Streeter]
I’ll love you right, all day and night
Everything that you want, boy already know
So you gonna see, how good it can be, come home with me. oooh
I been watching you from across the room
I wanna know your name, won’t you swing my way?
Shawty come my way, swing my way
Oooh, swing my way, swing my way
Swing my way, shawty, oooh

[Verse 1: Sam Martin]
Let's light it up, let's light it up
Until our hearts catch fire
Then show the world a burning light
That never shined so bright
We'll find a way, we'll find a way
To keep the cold night
From breaking in over the walls
Into the wild side, the hunger satisfied

[Chorus: Sam Martin]
We're burning up
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun

[Drop: David Guetta & Avicii]

[Verse 2: Sam Martin]
We'll never know, we'll never know
What stands behind the door
But I got a feeling
It's a feeling that's worth dying for
Just close your eyes, and hold your breath
Because it feels right
We'll keep it moving till we make it to the other side
And let's enjoy the ride!

[Chorus: Sam Martin]
We're burning up
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun

[Drop: David Guetta & Avicii]

[Outro: Sam Martin]
Let's light it up, let's light it up
Until our hearts catch fire
And show the world, a burning light
They've never shined so bright

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Went and dropped 7 hunnid on my Robin jeans
Mix the gas with the lean, call it gas-o-lean
Hittin' play bustin' juug, bitch it's Rich Gang
30 diamonds in my wrist, start my fireflame
Bugs Bunny mad at me, I got all the carats
When I hop out the Ferrari all the bitches starin'
I drive a 'Gatti or the new McLaren
I went and dropped 30 piece on each of my earrings
Double cup while I'm ridin' in my new foreign
I got choppa, I got racks, bitch, yo man borin'
I just step in KOD, all my cash pourin'
Sippin' lean and the Act' and it got me snorin'

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Havin' the plug on the gas
Havin' the plug on the mid
Havin' the plug on the choppa, the beam
Havin' the plug on the six
30k Rollie on my arm
50k VVS diamond my charm
I got the bomb like Osama
Sending my troops overseas like Obama
Hit the pot with the left hook, now they mad at me
When I pull up in that drop, oh yeah, it's that dab daddy
Shooters on go and that's automatic
Bad bitches gettin' too dramatic
Quavo makes movies, I'm cinematic
Lowkey with the fight like the Hidden Dragon

[Verse 3: Offset]
Whippin' the brick, now my hand got that arthritis
Pistol locked up in his mouth, he got gingivitis
Pull up in ghost like Michael Myers
I’m the plug in my city, I got plenty buyers
Soulja keep telling me he got the cipher, the law ticket
I'ma pull up and come get it, my money is tall as a midget
And I got J's, they gon' come back like frisbee's
Certified Keisha (Gas!), you gotta pay me monifa
Loud beatin' loud like a speaker, pull out the choppa and eat'cha
Whippin' the particles, and I got two bricks, they lookin' identical
My plug is an alien, don’t got no tentacles
But he pull up with the batch of the vegetables
You can even come and get you some edibles

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank

[Intro: Meek Mill]
R.I.P to all the young niggas that couldn't make it here
Ain't no love in the summertime

[Hook: All Steezy]
I'm kinda hot right now
I think I'll let the clock wind down
We must've hit the finish line, cause
Ain't no love in the summertime (x7)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Ain't no love in the summertime
Where young niggas dying for a pair of number nine
Jordans, They got it scorching on the other side
Ever see a nigga get murdered and see his mother cry
Prolly one of the reasons I never cried
Trying to ball for a hundred summers and never die
Last time I seen my daddy I had to tell him bye
Rolling down in the ground mama couldn't tell me why
So I was on the corner all them late nights
Young nigga out there swimming with the great whites
Cops always shining on me like a stage light
It wasn't no time for stage fright
Niggas busting, medics rushing clearing the scene
Young niggas was dying boy I pray its never my team
So we out here strapping
Before this rapping I was trapping
I'm talking middle of summer when niggas get put in caskets oh!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil' Snupe]
My momma had me young and my daddy he was gone to the pen
So I grew up thuggin' with my friends chasing ends
Hopefully sit in a Benz
Rapping just what I live swear its no need to pretend
I been outchea long, daddy he was gone
And what's crazy about that I don't know when he coming home
But that don't stop shit I still be in my fucking zone
I've been the king of this shit give me my motherfucking throne
Nigga If I could go back I wouldn't rewind shit
I started taking over niggas got behind quick
Then friends started switching, bitches start acting different
But I can't get off my mission guess its just my ambition

[Hook]
Don’t let nobody tell you what you can do, what you can believe, what you can achieve. Don’t let nobody but you

You know, people be looking at me like I got a problem or something. Like I’m uncontrollable or something. Like I don’t do what I’m supposed to do. You know it’s like they want to have everybody so brainwashed. They want to control everybody, you know, rumors, lies, media, marketing. It’s like they want to steal you from you, and sell you back to you after they stole it. They want to make you feel like you less than who you really are

Cuz as far as I’m concerned everybody’s a star. See they want to make you feel like you less than you really are. Cuz as far as I’m concerned everybody’s a star

You know, uh, the first thing they do is crush your dreams. Crush your dreams. Then add a couple drops of low self-esteem. And then I don’t think everything is what it seems. And control you with lies. And control you with lies

You know Imma tell you something, first thing they do is crush your dreams. Then let’s add a couple, a couple of drops of low esteem. And they control you with lies. And they control you with lies. And they control you with lies. We goin’ out of control tonight. We goin’ out of control tonight. Ahh

How many people tonight with a show of hands think they are fucking awesome? 

[Crowd cheers]

Now with a show of hands: How many people tonight have had people tell you your whole life that you wasn’t fucking awesome? 

[Crowd cheers]

See this is what I’m talking about.This is what I’m talking about. This is what I’m talking about. I mean, this is what I’m talking about, this is what I’m talking about

How many people tonight have ever talked to somebody right, that you know they’ll say, I don’t know what’s wrong with Kanye or make it seem like I’m a bad person in some way, right? Now what have I ever done that was so wrong other than believe in myself? Now believing in yourself is so, so, so wrong that the other side is so, so, so, so strong, they’re trying to beat down and demonize and dishumanize — I don’t know if that’s a word or not, but it’s now a word, cuz I said it’s a fucking word — and try to dishumanize people who believe in themselves. Cuz then what happens? Then you believe in yourself. And then you believe in yourself and you believe anything is possible. How many people believe that what they dream about, what y’all want to do, whether you want to be a doctor or lawyer, a designer, a musician, video-game programmer, a lighting guy, a manager … how many people want to contribute something to the world?

You see, I know you all might have seen some of my interviews and seen me on TV, but what I was saying the whole time is, what I was saying the whole time is, cuz I’m not — 

[to stagehand] making it lighter, make it lighter, the second, the second light — I’m not particularly angry or anything like that, but what I’m saying is, they taking the idea of celebrity and trying to make me seem I was stupid or something. You know, when I take these meanings and shit, 

[crowd chants “Kanye”] people they talk to you like you’re stupid or something. And then you look back and say, you know, like I’m not gonna call no names out, I’m not going to mention Nike or nothing like that. I’m not going to say no names or anything

But if you’re a creative and you want to create, and you just want to create more, this is exactly what I’ve been fighting for. So if you hear me talking about Louis Vuitton or the Gucci Group or anything like that. I’m not dissing Louis Vuitton, I’m not dissing the Gucci Group and shit. I’m just saying, don’t discriminate against me, because I’m a black man or because I’m a celebrity, and tell me that I can create, but not feel. Cuz you know damn well there aren’t no black guys or celebrities making no Louis Vuitton nothing. They let Pharrell make those glasses, and we liked them, right? They let me make those shoes, and we liked them right?
And they say, “No, no, no, nigga. Not no more. That’s too much. That’s too much. No, no, no, no, no, no, nigga not no more. That’s way too much. That’s way too much. Stay in your place. Sit in the front of that show and wear this jacket I made you. Stay in your place. Do what you get paid to do. Stay in your place. Don’t embarrass yourself trying to chase your dreams. Save face. Save face.”

That’s why I got this fucking mask on, cuz I ain’t worried about saving face. Fuck my face! Let’s set ‘em off. Pause. Now they finally got a headline. But fuck whatever my face is supposed to mean! Fuck whatever Kanye is supposed to mean! It’s about my dreams. It’s about everybody’s dreams. It’s about creating. It’s not about the idea of being a fucking celebrity, it’s not about the idea of a black man trying to do fashion and shit. Cuz these walls that I break down, these walls that I break down and we will

And I’m arguing with my friend Spike Jonze in the car cuz he said, Kanye, what you need to say is you’re gonna try. You’re gonna try to break them down. Don’t say you’re just going to do it. And I said, I am gonna do it! I told Kim seven years ago, I’m gonna marry you! And I’m telling you right now as I stand on this stage, all this shit that you heard me talking about, I’m gonna come and back all that shit up. You don’t know how hard it was to get the Nikes, that wasn’t my fault. They try to control y’all and try to control me. And when I was in my negotiations, they told me, “We don’t negotiate with celebrities.” That’s like a terrorist. They talk to you like it’s fucking terrorist

You know, I just want to make something awesome. I just want to be awesome, and I want to hang around my awesome friends and change the fucking world, and that’s exactly what I plan to do. And if you plan to do the same, put your hands in the air right now. If you just want to be awesome and make awesome shit and change the fucking world and this is what you plan to do

Let’s have a toast for the douchebags

"Let me assert my firm belief that the only thing that we have to fear is... fear itself"

[Ad-Libs]
Kutt The Check, oh
Kutt The Check, Bobby!

[Verse 1]
Ladies and gentlemen
Gentlemen, consider this moment the Genesis
This is the part where you flip the fuck out as you feel the adrenaline
I'm only here to give, I'm only here to give you the experience
Oh what an experience, they probably should've prescribed me with Ritalin
But fuck it, rumor has it A.D.H.D wasn't real, it was just an experiment
All of these years I was taught to be ignorant
Tryin' to figure out why I'm so different
Modern day life is set up like a pyramid
I was sleep, man I woke from the ignorance
Wake up now, tryna' sell me a membership
Shittin' on niggas so much that I'm hemorrhaging
Your bitch at my concert auditioning
She wants me to buy her some booty shots
But I can't fix a flat, I'm not Michelin
My mind's overflowing with images
So many thoughts I can never remember them
But I never forget to go straight to the source
I learned to cut out all the middle men
I got no patience for your basics
Time is dwindling, you just ain't interesting
No strangers inside of the organization
That shit is strictly prohibited
The music industry is sickening
But no one will ever admit this shit
These niggas ain't making the numbers they make
And shit, half of these niggas pretending

[Break]
Yo, fuck a hater, fuck a genre
No genre
You can't box it in
They try to box me in but they couldn't box me in
They try to describe me but they just still can't describe me to this day
You'll never be able to describe me
No genre, no genre, no genre
The label

[Verse 2]
Why do I bother (why do I bother
Spending time gathering thoughts up to prove I go a little bit harder
I'm like Jesus on the microphone
I make vodka from water (shots, shots, shots)
Kinda' like Jimmy Carter, just a little bit darker
The rap game just got a little bit smaller
I just lay down the facts
So lay down and stay down or stay off my sack
Niggas say I ain't dope, need to lay off the crack
Bustin' like a motherfuckin' AR with lasers
Drop a fuckin' bomb on the radar like Adolf was back
I blow a state straight off the map
Hundred round ricochet, when them stray rounds come back
Got to go and get this paper, I can't hang out to chat
Where the, where the, where the players at?
Bring the paper back
Running through the racks like a motherfuckin' pyromaniac
I need a lady that ain't a basic rat, with a crazy gat
With a decent booty hanging out her back
Give that thing a smack like a angry black (pow)
But before I smash gotta' wear a safety hat
Bobby where the mac? Bobby where the mac?
Man Eastside got the flow, had to bring it back
Now motherfuckers acting conscious and shit
Just cause you're dressed like a hippie
Attending the Coachella concert and shit
Don't make you no different than me
Cause I happen to like making money and shit
I'm just being honest, I never make promises
I just pay homage and shit
No Genre you bitch

Where will the music industry be in 20 years, 30 years, 50 years?

Before I tell you my thoughts on the matter, you should know that you're reading the opinion of an enthusiastic optimist: one of the few living souls in the music industry who still believes that the music industry is not dying…it's just coming alive

There are many (many) people who predict the downfall of music sales and the irrelevancy of the album as an economic entity. I am not one of them. In my opinion, the value of an album is, and will continue to be, based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work, and the financial value that artists (and their labels) place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace. Piracy, file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically, and every artist has handled this blow differently

In recent years, you've probably read the articles about major recording artists who have decided to practically give their music away, for this promotion or that exclusive deal. My hope for the future, not just in the music industry, but in every young girl I meet…is that they all realize their worth and ask for it

Music is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for. It's my opinion that music should not be free, and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album's price point is. I hope they don't underestimate themselves or undervalue their art

Arrows Through the Heart

In mentioning album sales, I'd like to point out that people are still buying albums, but now they're buying just a few of them. They are buying only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren't alone in feeling so alone. It isn't as easy today as it was 20 years ago to have a multiplatinum-selling album, and as artists, that should challenge and motivate us

There are always going to be those artists who break through on an emotional level and end up in people's lives forever. The way I see it, fans view music the way they view their relationships. Some music is just for fun, a passing fling (the ones they dance to at clubs and parties for a month while the song is a huge radio hit, that they will soon forget they ever danced to). Some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives, like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past

However, some artists will be like finding "the one." We will cherish every album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children and grandchildren. As an artist, this is the dream bond we hope to establish with our fans. I think the future still holds the possibility for this kind of bond, the one my father has with the Beach Boys and the one my mother has with Carly Simon

I think forming a bond with fans in the future will come in the form of constantly providing them with the element of surprise. No, I did not say "shock"; I said "surprise." I believe couples can stay in love for decades if they just continue to surprise each other, so why can't this love affair exist between an artist and their fans?

In the YouTube generation we live in, I walked out onstage every night of my stadium tour last year knowing almost every fan had already seen the show online. To continue to show them something they had never seen before, I brought out dozens of special guest performers to sing their hits with me. My generation was raised being able to flip channels if we got bored, and we read the last page of the book when we got impatient. We want to be caught off guard, delighted, left in awe. I hope the next generation's artists will continue to think of inventive ways of keeping their audiences on their toes, as challenging as that might be
There are a few things I have witnessed becoming obsolete in the past few years, the first being autographs. I haven't been asked for an autograph since the invention of the iPhone with a front-facing camera. The only memento "kids these days" want is a selfie. It's part of the new currency, which seems to be "how many followers you have on Instagram."

Fan Power

A friend of mine, who is an actress, told me that when the casting for her recent movie came down to two actresses, the casting director chose the actress with more Twitter followers. I see this becoming a trend in the music industry. For me, this dates back to 2005 when I walked into my first record-label meetings, explaining to them that I had been communicating directly with my fans on this new site called Myspace. In the future, artists will get record deals because they have fans—not the other way around

Another theme I see fading into the gray is genre distinction. These days, nothing great you hear on the radio seems to come from just one musical influence. The wild, unpredictable fun in making music today is that anything goes. Pop sounds like hip hop; country sounds like rock; rock sounds like soul; and folk sounds like country—and to me, that's incredible progress. I want to make music that reflects all of my influences, and I think that in the coming decades the idea of genres will become less of a career-defining path and more of an organizational tool

This moment in music is so exciting because the creative avenues an artist can explore are limitless. In this moment in music, stepping out of your comfort zone is rewarded, and sonic evolution is not only accepted…it is celebrated. The only real risk is being too afraid to take a risk at all

Celebrity Spotlight

I predict that some things will never change. There will always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of musicians, especially the younger ones. Artists who were at their commercial peak in the '70s, '80s and '90s tell me, "It was never this crazy for us back then!" And I suspect I'll be saying that same thing to younger artists someday (God help them). There continues to be a bad girl vs. good girl/clean-cut vs. sexy debate, and for as long as those labels exist, I just hope there will be contenders on both sides. Everyone needs someone to relate to

And as for me? I'll just be sitting back and growing old, watching all of this happen or not happen, all the while trying to maintain a life rooted in this same optimism

And I'd also like a nice garden

[Verse 1]
I am the promise that you cannot keep
Reap what you sow, find what you seek
I am the sorceress down in the deep
I am the earth under your feet
I am the moon with no light of my own
You are the sun, guarding your throne
I heard the angels whisper to me
"Look for the signs, he is the one."

[Chorus]
I'll light a candle here in the dark
Making my way to your heart
I'll cast a spell that you can't undo
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too

[Verse 2]
I'll be the bride that is married to life
You are the day, I am the night
Weave you a blanket of silver and gold
I'll keep you warm, do as I'm told
I need your strength, it will keep me from harm
I'll be your queen, safe in your arms
Don't wanna get to the end of my days
Saying I wasn't amazed

[Chorus]
I'll light a candle here in the dark
Making my way to your heart
I'll cast a spell that you can't undo
Till you wake up and you find
I'll light a candle here in the dark
Making my way to your heart
I'll cast a spell that you can't undo
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too

And tell your man, play the back, like a spine
He only last six seconds, like a Vine

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
I'm so confused, if you only knew she came to give it to you

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
How my mom gone pay the bills when these jobs ain't hiring?
Metal keep firing, the hood's getting tiresome (x2)
Why the fuck you think I go so hard when I'm writing it?
Tryna feed the kids, the narcs striking us like lighting
My young boy 17 took a 20 to 40
By the time he do that 20, my youngin' be 40
Called me yesterday, told me he pleaded, they caught him
Couldn't beat it, co-defendants was telling our lawyer
I don't spit for the kids, spit it how it is
Why would I tell you something different? this is how I live
How I came up junkies shooting their brains up
Niggas letting them things bust all over the same stuff
Heard the nigga killed my dad still walk in these streets
So what the fuck you think gone happen he walk into me?
Walk into murder, Glock walking the 33
Cause when that nigga kill my pop it's like he murdered me
Upstate nightmares dreams of getting rich
Got me grinding like a fiend tryna get his fix
All they hustle for is clothes tryna to get a whip
These young boys think you good if you get it brick
Try to tell them niggas chill, chill don't pay the bills
But how you gone pay the bills if you got a will?
And how you gone feed your kids if you got a bid?
But I can't blame them its the same shit that I done did
Be the ones close to you wanna do the most to you
Blink your eye, turn around, nigga got the toast to you
On some Rico shit, my nigga's 21 and got the Rico hit
Niggas will kill their own homies on some Nino shit
For the love of the green and the American dream
For the love of the money seen hysterical things
Niggas will serve their own moms if she ask for a beam

[Verse 1: CeeLo Green]
I started a war
And I landed on my own sword
Wish I could take back those stupid things I said
How could I be so foolish?
I called out to God
But the devil keeps answering
I'm tryin' every little remedy I can
But it's all just bullshit

[Pre-Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Well, everybody says
Time will clean up this mess

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
But only you
Only you
Only you can make it better, put me back together
Come on baby, let's be real
Only you
Only you
Only you could stop the bleeding, give me what I'm needing
Tell me so my heart can heal
Only you

[Verse 2: Lauriana Mae]
I'm dressing my wounds
But the blood it keeps soaking through
Yeah, I cut it just a little bit too deep
And I feel so dizzy
I pick up my phone
And throw it against the wall
And I cry like a baby in my sleep
Without you
With me

[Pre-Chorus: Lauriana Mae]
Well, everybody says
Time will clean up this mess

[Chorus: Lauriana Mae, Cee-Lo Green]
But only you
Only you
Only you can make it better, put me back together
Come on baby, let's be real
Only you
Only you
Only you could stop the bleeding, give me what I'm needing
Tell me so my heart can heal

[Bridge: Lauriana Mae,  Cee-Lo Green]
Only you can make me smile in the pouring rain
And you can take the hurt right out of my pain
I know I can try to fill the space inside
With somebody else but there's no use

[Chorus: Lauriana Mae, Cee-Lo Green, Both]
Only you
Only you
Only you can make it better, put me back together
Come on baby, let's be real
Only you
Only you  (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Only you could stop the bleeding, give me what I'm needing
Tell me so my heart can heal
Only you

Lem the Clam tho, he really gives a damn if dale really does get nailed slamming down the scotch & then going outside with Maurice, who aint the Peoria Kid & dont look the same way as they do in Des Moines, Iowa & good old debbie, she comes along & both her & dale, they start shacking up in the newspapers & jesus who can blame 'em & Amen & oh lordy, & how the parades dont need your money baby . . . it's the confetti & one george washington & Nadine who comes running & says where's Gus? & she's salty about the bread he's been making off her worms while dollars becoming pieces of paper . . . but people kill for paper & anyway you cant buy a thrill with a dollar as long as pricetags, the end of the means & only as big as your fist & they dangle from a pot of golden rainbow . . . which attacks & which covers the saddles of noseless poets & wonder blazing & somewhere over the rainbow & blinding my married lover into the ovation maniacs/cremating innocent child into scrapheap for vicious controversy & screwball & who's to tell charlie to stop & not come back for garbage men arent serious & they gonna get murdered tomorrow & next march 7th by the same kids & their fathers & their uncles & all the rest of these people that would make leadbelly a pet . . . they will always kill garbage men & wiping the smells but this rainbow, she goes off behind a pillar & sometimes a tornado destroys the drugstores & the floods bring polio & leaving Gus & Peg twisted in the volleyball net & Butch hiding in madison square garden . . .

Like yeah, it’s mega pain in this bitch
It don’t get much more Decatur than this
More Decatur than this, bet you can’t get much more faded than this
Seventeen minutes ago, she took a dose
Now that the feelings arrived, now we both in the zone
We feeling the vibe

[Prehook]

Fireworks right here

[Verse 2 – Ty Dolla $ign]
Pull up to the club on Forgi’s, with a bad bitch and my homies
Hop out feeling like an OG, got my screw face on like emojis
Walk in the bitch, I’m creasing, hundred bottles every weekend
After the club we freaking, my girl like girls, Latifah
All up in the club smoking weed, fuck security
Girl better turn back off them lights, we in here 20 deep
Sipping Hennessey, give a fuck if we wrong or right
Tell a nigga hold that, hundred dollar tip, I can blow that
This your girlfriend, she gon blow that
Wipe it off on her like a doormat
All my niggas, all my niggas look rich as fuck
All my bitches, all my bitches for sure gon fuck
We ain’t cuffing hoes, we pass em
She need a ride, I call a taxi
Do I give a fuck, just ask me
Said no, and started laughing

[Prehook + Hook]

[Chorus: B.o.B]
You ain’t never met a nigga like me, my nigga
You ain’t never seen a bitch like this, my nigga
You ain’t smoking on a pack like this, my nigga
You ain’t never rolled in a Lambo like this
You ain’t never rolled in a Lambo like this
You ain’t never rolled in a Lambo like this
You ain’t never seen a bitch like this, my nigga
You ain’t never met a nigga like me, my nigga

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
You met a nigga like me? You a liar
If you smoking like me then you high
I'mma need about 13 freaks tonight
It’s so many bitches, looking like a freak collage
And she finna swallow my Pina Colada
The way I throw the D, she gon need a massage
If she wake up tomorrow, a hangover got her
We party from Vegas to Reno, Nevada
We do it big, cause life is a bitch
That’ll eat you alive like a sea of piranhas
The sneakers I got ain’t released until autumn
And you ain’t even seen 'em, and you ain’t even got 'em
I’m not a rapper, I’m a rock star
I’m not a rapper, I’m a rock star
And if you see me in a Lambo
I got the bitch with the top off

[Chorus: B.o.B]
You ain’t never met a nigga like me, my nigga
You ain’t never seen a bitch like this, my nigga
You ain’t smoking on a pack like this, my nigga
You ain’t never rolled in a Lambo like this
You ain’t never rolled in a Lambo like this
You ain’t never rolled in a Lambo like this
You ain’t never seen a bitch like this, my nigga
You ain’t never met a nigga like me, my nigga

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
I ain’t ever rolled in a Lambo
My bitch dance on a stage named Lambo
Hundred round drum that’s ammo, BRRRRRRRT-PRSH something like Rambo
Dicks hit the door, hit the scale and the blow
How we running that, quarterback scramble
I won’t hit it with the fork, put a knife in the pyrex
Young nigga trapping out a bando
Turn 126 to a 252, worked the wrist
I could win me a Lambo
Don’t want to be in love, I can pay for affection
White girl awkward to handle
10 shows for the 20 now there’s 200 bands
Book a show, drop 50 til you’re at the hotel
Rock two in one night then the cook want to front you cause the microwave on while we at the hotel
I say I don’t get tired!

[Chorus: B.o.B]
You ain’t never met a nigga like me, my nigga
You ain’t never seen a bitch like this, my nigga
You ain’t smoking on a pack like this, my nigga
You ain’t never rolled in a Lambo like this
You ain’t never rolled in a Lambo like this
You ain’t never rolled in a Lambo like this
You ain’t never seen a bitch like this, my nigga
You ain’t never met a nigga like me, my nigga

[Verse 3: Jake Lambo]
Fly like a plane in the sky high
Jake is the name, I’m a dangerous guy
Had me in the cage and I ain’t know why
See I am a beast, no I ain’t gon' lie
Came here to claim what I want, bang in the trunk
Hands in the sky, get 'em up
I kill 'em, yup
On my high horse like giddyup
Really bruh, I’m just tryna see a milly bucks
Nigga what?
I go so retarded, go the hardest don’t you see
You can look around the world, still never find another me
With that said I'mma rip off heads
Whoever running shit, then I’ll break y’all legs
I’m just tryna make hits like baseball players
On the way to the top, just a few more stairs
Jake!

[Chorus: B.o.B]
You ain’t never met a nigga like me, my nigga
You ain’t never seen a bitch like this, my nigga
You ain’t smoking on a pack like this, my nigga
You ain’t never rolled in a Lambo like this
You ain’t never rolled in a Lambo like this
You ain’t never rolled in a Lambo like this
You ain’t never seen a bitch like this, my nigga
You ain’t never met a nigga like me, my nigga

[Hook: Victoria Monet]
Baby, don’t you know
Everything you do away from home
Could leave me here alone
So baby don’t you go, no
No, no
No-o-o-oo
No, no
No-o-o-oo

[Verse 1: B.o.B.]
I saw a kid 12 years old, with a pack of cigarettes and a Glock
Cause in this ‘partments it was easy to cop
Looking for a nigga slipping, yeah they easy to spot
In the streets the enemies are just as evil as cops
The only word he ever heard from his pops was
If this the devil’s world then who hangs out at the top
He had cocaine dreams, and Scarface nightmares
I thought to myself, does anyone in this life care
Growing too fast like his days are lightyears
His mama says go to church, you need a light prayer
You think the streets need you? Well I need you right here
You need to slow it down, cause the streets don’t fight fair
For real!

[Hook: Victoria Monet]
Baby, don’t you know
Everything you do away from home
Could leave me here alone
So baby don’t you go, no
No, no
No-o-o-oo
No, no
No-o-o-oo

[Verse 2: Jake Lambo]
It’s easy to get in trouble in the place where I’m from
Niggas lacking the education but be packing a gun
I just kick it with the homies and be having some fun
Mama keep calling, I understand you protecting your son
You found that I be smoking and I know it makes you mad
And I know you see his trace, scared I'ma be just like my dad
Scared I’m doing something bad, scared I might end up dead
Well look I chose another path so get those worries out your head
I'ma keep on doing it how I’m doing it
Stay working hard, making this music and
Show you I got to get it, I do
They asking my motivation and I reply that it’s you mama

[Hook: Victoria Monet]
Baby, don’t you know
Everything you do away from home
Could leave me here alone
So baby don’t you go, no
No, no
No-o-o-oo
No, no
No-o-o-oo

[Verse 3: B.o.B.]
A deadly trend that never ends
City full of negligence, pregnant pedestrians
I used to think, 'am I a prisoner or a resident?'
They book us for possession but they keep shipping weapons in
Either the Glock shoots you or a cop do you
They set the system up to lock you up a lot sooner
Everything you try to do they try to out do you
My mama said hallelujah cause I got a future
I got a future after something newer
They try to sell you bullshit because it sounds cooler
And if you stand out from the crowd they label you a loser
Don’t throw your life away, don’t let your eyes fool you
That’s how they use you

[Hook: Victoria Monet]
Baby, don’t you know
Everything you do away from home
Could leave me here alone
So baby don’t you go, no
No, no
No-o-o-oo
No, no
No-o-o-oo

[Verse 1: Mac Demarco]
Standing on the corner, trying to keep it clean
A fine looking woman in a pair of Lee's
Take her back to my place, lay her down in bed
Now she starts to strip down, I say leave 'em on instead

[Chorus]
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans

[Verse 2: Mac Demarco]
Later in the evening, dipping in the tub
Washing, wearing Wranglers, I think that I'm in love
Straight leg or a bootcut, legging, darling, please
Stay with me forever, don't take off those jeans

[Chorus]
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans

[Solo]

[Outro]
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans

If you ever need somebody to lean on
Lean on me, lean on me
Cause I'mma make you feel so high that you could live for eons
Lean on me, lean on me

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
See it's me they leanin' on
Let me get my Morgan Freeman on
Brand new this, brand new that
Won't see no one with these sneakers on
Drunk as fuck by three in the mornin'
She came through 'bout four AM
Five o'clock I'm back in the club
And they goin' crazy cause they know that's him
Who's that's him? Yeah, that's me
Call that boy young Bobby Ray
The way she moves, she don't need to worry
I can tell everything her body say
But, DJ, bring that record back
DJ bring that record back
She leaned up, booty hella fat
I'm throwin' that cheese like pepper jack
Lean on me

[Hook: Victoria Monet]
If you ever need somebody to lean on
Lean on me, lean on me
Cause I'mma make you feel so high that you could live for eons
Lean on me, lean on me

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Lemme get down to the business
Young nigga came from the trenches
Why the weed lit like that?
Cause you don't ever know when it's finished
So we in this thing 'till it's done
Go hard, fuck it, we young
We turned up in this motherfucker
You scared of life, you better run
I'm so high I can elevate
Get your glass in the air, let it levitate
Pour some out for the homies
Then save some for the better days
She give it to me like it's mine
I'mma chop her down with this pine
I spit codeine if you need a fix
You can lean off of these lines
Lean on me

[Hook: Victoria Monet]
If you ever need somebody to lean on
Lean on me, lean on me
Cause I'mma make you feel so high that you could live for eons
Lean on me, lean on me

[Bridge: B.o.B]
You need something to lean on, this your faded song
This your faded song, this your faded song
And if you need a light, you can never lean wrong
This your faded song, this your faded song

[Hook: Victoria Monet]
If you ever need somebody to lean on
Lean on me, lean on me
Cause I'mma make you feel so high that you could live for eons
Lean on me, lean on me

[Bridge: B.o.B]
You need something to lean on, this your faded song
This your faded song, this your faded song
And if you need a light, you can never lean wrong
This your faded song, this your faded song

[Verse 1: Mac Demarco]
Cruising in the Moonlight
Heading downtown
Looking for some fast love
Gotta get down
Boogie Woogie Woman
Looking my way
So if you want a good time
You know just where I stay

[Chorus]
At the Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club
Rock and Roll Night Club

[Verse 2: Mac Demarco]
Meet me on the dance floor
Let me shake my thing
We are all just players
In the rock and roll game
Boogie Woogie woman
Join me for a dance
So if you want a good time
Girl you know my plans

[Verse 1]
Well as I look up to the sky
My angels pass me by
And all this pain inside
But on the surface I look fine
At night I lay awake
I haven't slept since yesterday
But I just continue to breathe
And maybe one day I can leave
So

[Hook]
Follow me and then one by one we'll all go marching
If you believe, then you know where we're going, darling
Follow me and then one by one we'll all go marching
Into the stars, where we belong

[Verse 2]
Well as I walk this narrow road
Many faces I approach
Though some try to buy my soul
But all that glitters is not gold
And it's sad to say
But to some people I'm insane
Maybe August, maybe May
But we'll all leave here one day
So

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh

[Hook]

[Intro]
Get, get it in tonight
Get it, get it in tonight
Get it, get it in tonight
Get it, get it in tonight
Yep

[Pre-Hook: B.o.B & Mila J]
So what, we do what we wanna
Everwhere we go, man, we ain't never sober
High on marijuana, shots and Coronas
Wake up on the sofa, fuck it, we can do it over
(x2)

[Hook: Mila J]
I wanna get it in tonight
I'm gonna get it in tonight
I'm gonna get it in tonight
I'm gonna get it in tonight

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
When you see me I'm probably faded
I'm drankin' then I'm probably wasted
And if you a stranger smokin' my weed up, you in violation
Uh, intoxicated so my eyes glazed and dilated
And all that's on my mind is a fine dime that I can have relation with tonight
Not tomorrow, cause tomorrow's not tonight
And tomorrow's never promised so tonight I'm getting ripe
All aboard onto my spaceship get it in, we takin' flight
Where we goin'? Man, you never know, it's one hell of a life
Yeah, you know the saying
That's why it's get money, get money man, you know the plan
Anyone saying they don't wanna get money, you know they playin'
I just woke up high as fuck on someone's sofa, man
Like what the fuck we doin' jumpin' off the corner, man?
I get lifted, I don't understand; I overstand
Shit, I roll a blunt up tighter than some yoga pants
But that's what happens when you landin' where you wanna land
I'm never sober, man

[Pre-Hook: B.o.B & Mila J]

[Hook: Mila J]

[Outro]

[Produced by Sonny Digital]

[Intro: B.o.B]
Man, I'm 'bout to get right
Man, I'm 'bout to get right
Trip, trip, dead light

[Hook: Mike Fresh] x8
Everybody, get right
I'm 'bout to get right

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, J, I'm 'bout to get right
Yeah I'm 'bout to twist off, I'm 'bout to lift off, I'm 'bout to take flight
Flyin' with the brakes off so don't blow my buzz and don't kill my vibe
And you ask me is this the way I feel or is it still just a high
(is it still just a high)
There goes my imagination again
There goes my thoughts, away with the wind
There's no medication amazing as this
Your favorite fragrance, your favorite spliff
As real as they come, for niggas like us
Where days where the fakers get fake as they get
We take us a hit
We just be coolin', you lookin' anxious as shit
I know they see me, doin' my thang
I go too many places to trip
This shit I'm on, this shit so strong
You could take 20 vacations per hit
Man, ain't nobody as faded as this
Man, ain't no life as outrageous as this
And I would pull out my resume
But it's too many pages to flip

[Hook: Mike Fresh] x8

[Verse 2: Mike Fresh]
Everybody's got that vice
Everybody need what they need to get right
I won't judge you, so don't judge me
When you see me cranberry moonwalkin' my Sprite, all right
Fuckin' with Fresco, you smokin' the best dope
You been workin' all day, it's time to let go
So what, we high? So what, we drunk?
And if we run out, it's nothin' to get more
Livin' my life one day at a time
Tryna get right one play at a time
You never can predict what I'm gonna do next, No Genre
I ain't finna stay off in a line
If I had it my way, I'd ball everyday
Hit the mall everyday
Go through 100K, and put it all in the safe
What the hell are celebrations for?
Drinkin' moonshine out a mason jar
Patron margaritas, pretty señoritas
Bringing me everything I need like, "Si Señor"
You could pull up to the kick back
But you better have a six pack or somethin'
You don't wanna be the one empty handed
When everybody ask, "Where the liq at?"
Get right

[Hook: Mike Fresh] x8

[Verse 1]
Baby you deserve the best, you deserve the best tonight
It ain't much time left, so you know the time is right
Pay no mind to all the rumors, you get caught inside the hype
We can both take off, no commercial jet, it's a private kind of flight
We can both get so lit, like a stick of dynamite
I can tell that our bodies both click, kinda like a pilot light
I'mma fire the pussy up, you can cool it down with ice
When you talkin' to your friends, tell 'em he can't do it like me
Girl, ain't no option, girl he can't rock it, naw, he can't rock it like me
Girl keep on poppin', yeah keep on poppin', yeah keep on poppin' on me
You and I both know he basic
That dick got you starin' at your phone and you debating for real

[Hook]
Forget aboutcha nigga, you know you all that
I'll make you forget aboutcha nigga
And when he hits you, you won't call back
Forget aboutcha nigga, forget aboutcha nigga, forget aboutcha nigga
I'll make yo ass forget aboutcha nigga
Forget aboutcha nigga, forget aboutcha nigga
Forget aboutcha nigga

[Verse 2]
Aye, how come you can't get dick down some?
Bumpin' a shawty album
I'll give us both 'bout an hour 'til we both figure out the outcome
What's the outcome? Get it?
I don't wanna get too specific
But you know that I know you gon' miss it
When I'm holding you close and I hit it
That's how it's supposed to be, now she buzzin' all over me
Baby girl I'mma rock the boat, love overboard, love overseas
All night long I'm still strong
I don't know, somethin' must have came over me
Like a pornstar in a foreign car, we damn near broke 'bout both the seats
I shift gears, she roll the weed
In the trunk, that's where my motor be
She upload me pics, no clothing while she network socially
See she and I both know he basic
This dick got her staring at her phone and she debating, for real

[Hook]

[Bridge]
She's a sociallite
The social able type
Even her schedule is sexual, oh what a night
I'm sayin', "Oh, what a night, oh what a night"
I step into my DJ booth and say hello to the mic

[Hook]

[Outro] x2
I'll call, you can't get dick downfall
I'll make you forget about him
DC Young Fly: No Genre (pronounced jen-rey) everywhere
So when you out on my block, everybody got your "No Genre" shirts on

B.o.B: Genre. (pronounced ZHänrə)

DC Young Fly: Genre (pronounced jen-rey). Now if you want to change it to genre (pronounced ZHänrə) then you would put the 'j' right there. Matter of fact you should put me on the shirt holding the sign, another "No Genre" (pronounced jen-rey) sign leaning up on the "No Genre". So, you would be fly on top of fly
I need to change my name to "Fly Genre" (pronounced jen-rey). How does that sound? "DC Fly Genre" (pronounced jen-rey). OOOH! I'm gon' name my little girl that. Fly Genre, Fly Genre? Come here! Sit down! She said she's going to be bad. Sit down Fly Genre, sit down!

Wilding on the couch screaming out "free my nigga TIP"
Meek Milly what's the deally I be popping like a wheelie

Diamonds so clear you can see them in HD

[Hook: Young Dro]

I ain't really sociable my 44 ain't approachable

[?] shawty I stay right close to the 

[?]
Stupid ass pistol I like to make that thing transform

Went up in the booth and went sicker than a motherfucker

All kinds of ice bitch my diamonds got diamonds on
Stupid ass fresh shawty you don't want to pardon me
Hold up, I need to answer my phone some ho calling me

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]

My flow be hot as hell but my wrist keep me cool though
Cujo, ya cause I be snapping and I ain't trapping
I'm just rapping and look what happened
It ain't march I'm causing madness
We Maybaching on them two-tone
Crushing them like crouton
The cheers in the rear leaning back on the futon
Grand Hustle we do one thing
Get money money money money money I'm a young king

Nigga got a problem with it tell them my revolver said it

Though many will often try to duplicate the style I made up
If my weight up it wouldn't matter, you're slow as a paraplegic
Whoops you missed, here's my fist, eat it

You take out crews by yourself take out this one
I'm a soloist chaos is a soloist pick one
He's about to put more tracks in your soul
And put your crew in a pile and jack em up like a totem pole
I give you a dance and make you change direction or
Have a spot reserved in a handicapped parking section
How the hell can you leave when your train-less?
Your smooth sailing hit a storm and looks likes your failing
Left a band stranded empty handed
Put so much as a toe in my way and get branded
I'm standing colossal drag you out like a fossil
With a rap so hot it will cause a snot in your nostril
Take you out take you out with simplicity
I'm shocking so bad, I'll make you shit electricity
Try flip me or whip me you fucking fed bon appetite eat the concrete dick head

Relaxed inside my mind I tend to find
Rolled to space together and it had occurred to me (Hello?)
For a shooting star (Remember?)
Serving light, cosmic energy
Then I opened my eyes

[Break: SZA (Jill Scott)]
Sticks and stones might break my heart (Then I opened my eyes)

[Hook 1: SZA (Jill Scott)]
Reaching, stretching space and time for opportunity to sign you and me
Obscured in my divinity (Everything is)
Sticks and stones might break my heart
Won't give up my heart without a fight
Reaching, stretching space and time for opportunity to sign for you and me
Obscured in my divinity (Right here at your fingertips)
Sticks and stones might break my heart, tonight (Your fingertips)
I'm not giving up my heart without a fight (Right here at your fingertips)

She hop in the Lincoln. we hit my spot

Just came home playing with them birds like Vick
You ain't ever seen a nigga so fly like this
And this bag so much I make it say I'm the shit

Diamonds blue like I'm a crip
In the VIP with a five times two I'm trying to hit

If she don't like K then she probably like Meek
And if she ever fuck Meek he can make her fuck me
You ain't know, I got big boy figures
Bank account big call me bank account bigger
Ya that's the wizard
Wrist all glitter
Purple diamonds in the bezel like the watch on sizzurp
Ya I got stacks on deck
Been had a Maybach you ain't did that yet
You be frontin' to your boys, we ain't doing that act
Got a hundred acre crib 

[?]

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mel Love]

But its like I'm halfway in but I'm halfway out
I said first we STR them then Cherokee them in back of that
Them we go Camero with 

[?] in back of that
Who gon' challenge us got that Challenger in the back of that
GT 500 sound like thunder in the back of that
Finish that shit off with a Hummer in the back of that

Hop up out that bitch with the diamonds shining like who having that

The city respected highly

I see that you heard about me
Don't care then don't worry about me

[Verse 2: Mel Love]

Hell raiser sitting in the Trail Blazer SS
Nigga super sport 'bout to chirp out
Niggas hitting shit and they got that work out
On your mark get set we getting ready
All these niggas loose bunch of spaghetti

I be throwing the thirty we rain heavy here
Nigga anywhere every block anywhere
Letting the semi pop burn his chest like a Henny shot
Blasting, busting his top watching his 

[?]
Asking, I be like Arnold baby whats happening
Cracking, Rollie face studded its just a flashing
Fashion, D&G skully matching my jacket
Aston, sitting on 20's white as a napkin
Cracking, we got it popping baby what's happening
The 8 ball, taking scrape off
Fuck a shoe box I need a safe like baseball
Let my tool pop, knock off his face and take off
A maroon drop, niggas can't see me like Ray Charles
When the moon drop, goons rise them tools bought
Niggas getting it popping they busting them tools off
Halfwayed out in a halfway house
But its like I'm halfway in but I'm halfway out
I swear that's its a blessing to be halfway out
But 

[?] I be right back in
I said halfway in halfway out
Got to make my curfew I can't be halfway in
Cause if I'm halfway in then I'm halfway out
Then the warrant unit gon' take my right back in

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Geeking up with Thug, popping like a cork

A foreign class mate, I'mma look her up in literature
I peek up on her desk cause I heard she got a camel toe
I found out she was nothing and she want to fuck my vehicle
Me and lay in presidential suite with fifty fleece
I got a mansion on south beach like I play with the fucking Heat
So many bitches call my phone my ringtone is a beep
And I ain’t never been a Christian but got racks on my feet
Wendy Williams, I’m a charger, Imma slow up
My bitch hot like the sign at Dunkin Donuts
A hundred for a shave, fuck them designer cuts
I got on Ferragamo boxers, these designer nuts

Geeking up with Thug, popping like a cork

And the Grammy goes to... 'The College Dropout', Kanye West.

Umm, ya'll might as well get the music ready cause this is gonna take a while. Umm, when I had my accident, I found out at that moment nothing in life is promised except death. If you had the opportunity to play this game of life, you need to appreciate every moment. A lot of people don't appreciate their moment until its passed. And then you gotta tell them Al Bundy stories, "you remember when I..." but umm. Right now, is my time and my moment, thanks to the fans, thanks to the accident, thanks to God, thanks to Roc-A-Fella, Jay Z, Dame Dash, G, my mother, Rhymefest, everyone that has helped me and I plan to celebrate. I plan to celebrate and scream and pop champaign every chance I get cause I'm at the Grammys baby! I know... I know everybody ask me that question, they want to know, "what Kanye is getting well louder, he's gonna do something crazy." Everybody want to know what I would do if I didn't win... I guess we'll never know.

[Intro: DJ Drama]
Question
What does an old head and a young bull have in common?
Know the answer, anbody's liable to snitch
Real niggas stand up Philly Flamers

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I said the feds gave my nigga brick dime for an ounce of crack
And they gave my nigga 

[?] a dub for a bird
Stand up niggas caught their cases took the time
Feds came to get them they ain't say a fucking word
I know niggas that was OGs ratted on their own team
Took their whole clique down time for them to sit down
Same niggas acting tough tell them you a bitch now
Nigga used to do it big fuck 'em I'm the shit now
Real niggas stand up
And if you did it then there's consequences nigga man up
I remember them hungry day cutting them grams up
I stack a couple hundreds just to save a grand up
From a hundred dollars to a hundred thousand
Get you a couple bricks flood the hood like public housing
I was in the stands just watching like I was scouting
Pepping out all the players, balling Dion Waiters
Niggas in my hood are suckers beyond haters
Act hard but melt faster than Now & Laters
I just take a point I grab my the nine later
Rules to the game laugh now and cry later
Live now and die later
Fast cars, fast bitches
Live the fast life you better fall fast nigga
It ain't about who got the most it about who last nigga
And fuck a first place as long as I ain't last nigga
And I'm in the race, I'm too hungry to let a nigga taste
You trying to reach catch them in your face
My niggas ride like its the interstate
It ain't my birthday I'm getting cake
I remember sitting in the cell watching as my life replay
Writing 

[?] the feds got him up in VA
And free my nigga Lil' they got him upstate PA
State gave my nigga Rick 

[?] life
Nineteen he ain't get to live half his life
I was five I seen them lock my dad casket tight
And since then I've been clutching on the ratchet tight

[Verse 2: Oschino]
It was '05 moving birds Boston Market
Boss of the corner chilling in my corner office
It was all good, paper flowing like the Nile River

[?] some young and wild niggas
In the winter rocked the mink and in the summer dropped the top on 'em
Every other day different watch on 'em
They my niggas switched sides on me
Said they gon' ride on me
Shot me in front of my son he was just five hommie
Should've 

[?] cause a nigga went insane
Kingpins run the game nigga never been afraid
Bullet wounds still bleeding niggas bang them niggas back
Get rocks sold up that's how we live in this habitat
Never rat real deal, I was never an impostor
Cops sounding like Biggie Smalls asking who shot you
Don't worry about it pig, I'll handle my own
Call up 

[?] bang on niggas like I'm alone
One minute you a kingpin chilling with a mink
Next you a convict washing drawers in the sink
This the land of the homicide where y'all about the dollar
Most niggas here going to die before their grandfather
Niggas did 

[?] like Rottweiler
No gas in his crib so he can't take a hot shower
Grab his 30 gage 

[?] give a nigga hot shower
Cause they can't afford a burger or a fucking Caesar Salad
That's real
Ayy Drama
(What up Meek)
Who lot of speculation
Drama ain't riding for Philly
(Oh yea)
He only putting on for the A
(Is that so?)
What you think about that

I mean listen man
Don't blame me that every street across the world wants to claim me
Its a positive thing baby
You know born Children's Hospital
You know what I mean G town brick yard happy hallow what's up
West Philly 33rd 

[?] the bottom what's up man
Come on man born and raised man
Philly's what made me

[Chorus]
With the nunchucks
Rolling in your hood
Ask a big bad wolf "what is good?"
Feeling dumbstruck
I done been there, done that
But I wonder why I still feel so alone

[Verse 1]
Baby, stand up
But don't pull them pants up
You're pulling off my shirt
But should I leave my hands up?
Expression of fandom
You know that I've been good
But you still tear the cat up
And when you provoke me
You do it at random
I won't lead you on
But I hope that you can manage
You don't want to man up
You don't want to plan up

[Verse 2]
But you call me wifey
So what's the big idea?
Do I need to sit right here and fill my ears
While bullshit come out of your lips? I hear
Got me searching for insight insight
Guess I need to call this night off
Riddle me, riddle me that
Mr. Unintentional Ass
And his every interval fast
Throw that cheese and dough in that bag
With that Little Italy swag
Nigga, riddle, riddle me that
Why my mental instantly crash when you enter into me?
Gentle then ya ease up
I'm day dreaming
But now, whoa, I never daydream
But you're jumping from rooftops
And searching and hunting, my ninja
Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Chorus]
With the nunchucks
Rolling in your hood
Ask a big bad wolf "what is good?"
Feeling dumbstruck
I done been there, done that
But I wonder why I still feel so alone
(I've been there, I've been there)
Rolling in your hood
Ask a big bad wolf "what is good?"
(I wonder why, I wonder why, I wonder why)
But I wonder why I still feel so alone
(I wonder why) I wonder why (I wonder why) I wonder why
(I wonder why) I wonder why (I wonder why)
But I wonder why I still feel so alone

[Chorus: Young Thug]
My neck and wrist on froze, Sub-Zero
My neck and wrist, Sub-Zero
My neck and wrist is cold, Sub-Zero
My neck and wrist, Sub-Zero

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Easter pink my Sprite, I think I'm icy
I put a eight inside my one, I call it priceless
Five hundred for my Js, shouts out to Fly Kix
These nigga thinks I work in there, only wear fly kicks
Get it and push it down, get down and lay down
They call me "alphabets", I keep that K around
Wanna know something 'bout Young Thug?
Ask your girl, she stay around
That pussy commit crime, when they say I lay it down
Got weed stacked up like mounds, we smoke that shit by ounces
Got bezels around my watch, can't see or even count it
Got Tommy Hilfiger on the ice, I break a nigga kush on dice
She let me fuck all kind of ways, every day and every night

[Chorus: Young Thug]
My neck and wrist on froze, Sub-Zero

[Verse 2: Quavo]
I went to the jeweler, I copped the Franck Muller
Versace my neck and my ring is Medusa
Your ho my might be bad but my bitch is way cuter
I'm taking the trips and I fly to Bermuda
Sub-Zero, Sub-Zero, I get peso, I'm a Migo
I pull out the 'Rari, the bricks in the engine
Got Louis, got Bally, got Prada, got Fendi
I don't fuck with you, heard your partner is snitching
My partner got bags and they say you the witness
I'm sipping on lean and they killing my kidneys
My diamonds is green and my bitch came from Philly
I call the plug, he had to cash out
I copped me some ice and I hopped in my Bentley

[Bridge: Young Thug]
It's sunny outside, I'ma hop in the Bentley
The windows is tinted, y'all nigga pretending
Y'all niggas know you can catch me at the finish
Before you take it back 'cause you know the shit is rented
Lambo doors, whole lotta hoes, six price scotch

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Okay, my neck and my wrist, Sub-Zero
Okay, this dope that I whip, Sub-Zero
Sub-Zero, Sub-Zero, Sub-Zero, Sub-Zero

[Verse 3: MPA Wicced]
My ice on Antarctica
If you reach chopper knock off your Portugal
Now it's two door coupes, I came a long way from Marta
Got a traphouse been just like the Carter
And I get it like my father
You can't name another nigga that go harda'
Name 'em and I disclaim, frame 'em with out the picture
I got jewelry on, cost more than your life, nigga
Put your head up for a bargain, nigga
Hell nah, I ain't gon' argue, nigga
Wash my face off, then the job done
Jewelry heat just like the sun

[Chorus: Young Thug]
My neck and my wrist on froze, Sub-Zero

My neck and wrist, Sub-Zero
Okay, my neck and my wrist, Sub-Zero

Around the time when the crack hit was crazy
Philadelphia born and raised
North side Burks Street I spent most of my days
Across down 7th Street I bought most of my haze
And from my momma I got most of my ways
She was all I had
Fell in love same streets where I lost my dad
The home of throwbacks and Timberlands but we off of that
Had to step it up like Rocky
Cops locked me couldn't hold me I'm too cocky
I'm from a hood where these kids will hit you
Niggas beefing over cheese like Ishkabibble
Dark nights shots fly so don't stay out there
And you know we balling know we got AI back

I'm from the south side downtown
Section of a loud town
What make us sell out is the only way that we bound down
Black brothers incorporated laid the ground down
I come up on that Lady B and Mimi brown sound
It came at the age of 23rd and Watkins
Without a lot of options
Times was harder than Bernard Hopkins
Young bulls in the yard watching
While the neighbors playing Space Invaders at the corners store clock in
Take a notice to the cussies at the door copping
Now the hustlers in 

[?] ain't no way to stop it
Philly boys out to make a profit
We Gamble and Huff, and scrambling up to take a pocket

[Hook: Betty Wright]
So you've got so many diamonds
You wear all the finest clothes
And your grill is shining
As you're drivin down the streets of gold
But you, can't, blame, me, if I set this stage on fire

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
My new bitch she a whore cause she fuck with Gucci
And she fuck with Prada and she mess with Louie
I heard she fuck with Benji, she know that he be with me
Acting like a groupie, I let her Jimmy chew me
Her shoes be Giuseppe, mines be D squared
Double straps on them, nine hundred a pair
Ya, nominate me grinder of the year
Cause I be up early in the morning trying to grind me up a square
Just to get that dough, on your marks set go
Trying to move them O's like tic-tac-toe
When I see them hoes they be all trying to go
Joe ass niggas they be all trying to roll
But we don't move D's we just move with the heat
Live by the gun in the cold of the streets
Supposed to make it hot not cold in the streets
Same niggas running around they done told in the streets
But this is the life, what its like, by any means necessary
I'mma go and get it and retire in like Neveruary
So its 2012 for you rappers put an end to them
Scorpio flamer Mortal Kombat finish him

[Interlude: Betty Wright]
But you, can't, blame, me, if I set this stage on fire

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Game spitter flame spitter, lame niggas
Couldn't bang with us or hang with us, the same niggas
Went against me, trying to partnership me now
Cold enemies on that partner shit now
Cause they know I go hard as a tombstone
Any sign of disrespect, know you in the goon zone
Anywhere you see me at know I got that tool on
Make a nigga sound good like that autotune on
Labels keep calling they worster than my bitches
Rappers speak my name I say they worster than these snitches
This is the blueprint, beginning of some new shit
But nah this ain't Jay Z this Meek Milly baby
Louie belt v neck chillen in my AP
Dawg I go crazy like I got rabies, I'm the man in my city
If you ask around the town they say nobody fucking with me

[Hook: Betty Wright]
So you've got so many diamonds
You wear all the finest clothes
And your grill is shining
As you're drivin down the streets of gold
But you, can't, blame, me, if I set this stage on fire

[Intro]
Right about now you are about to be possessed
By the sounds of MC Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock

[Hook](x2)
It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I want a rock right now
That's what the fiends say when I come around
I'm not internationally known
But I'm known around the microphone
I get lifted
Puffing on that 

[?] shit
Sipping on Patrón
It got a nigga twisted
I be in my zone, before I get the bitches
I'm going to get the paper
Like motherfuck a hater, wait up
One shot, two shots, three shots, four
I'm wasted I don't want no more
Louie V everything down to the floor
We buying out the bar 'til this mahfucker close
Let's get it

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I'm Meek Milly got a real fucking mind set
I got the biddies trying to win me like a contest

I'm balling this year
You getting money so what I don't care
Hit the club I ball we don't stare
They see me shining them haters they won't dare
I don't say I'm so fly say I'm so leer
Ten grand man walking down no fear

You and your friend Ménage I call Boo
Boo will call Omelly, Omelly will call Coon
You call a couple of your friends 

[?]

[?] cause I got a lot of whores
I'm not a sucker and I don't need a body guard
Stay strapped all black mac
And tell your whole team not to frame no rat
Let's get it

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Break a 9 to a bunch of dimes then you grind up
Money got me showin my ass can't even hold my pants up
20 niggas standin on the flat all getting off
Found a junkie dead in Brooke Lake with his hands sawed
Try me in the 6 I'm gone raise this 45 up
Shave a brick put it back together that's a lineup
Remix the chick use a little cut that's a temp fade
And if he got a chopper never ever bring a switchblade
I'm a multimillionaire I gotta couple hundred on me
And I'm a mack I tote a strap I make you stick yourself like tony
I'd give a nigga my whole stash if he can take this jewelry off me
And I'm so bossy in my office smoking Kush and sipping coffee

[Hook: K Camp]
They said I couldn't get rich out here bet money
All that sideline talk don't make no money
Bout that bread y'all niggas out here too funny
Hit yo bitch then leave her with no money

[Verse 2: K Camp]
Money is the motive if you speak it then I'm with ya
Any sideline nigga they get cropped out the picture
If you ask me yeah I'm ready
Got your ho on a mission
Catch me running through your city like a damn politician
Boy I'm all about a check
She don't ask no questions
Boy she all about the neck
Say she wanna crash
So I let my partners wreck
Lookin at a nigga that stay flyer than a jet
They don't hear me yet
I'mma get that check bet money
Y'all niggas out here funny
You know a young nigga on the go
Gotta have that green like Gumby
I'm a fool with the dough too clumsy
On the clock Monday through Sunday
Everyday I gotta get that money
And I learned that from the big homie

[Hook: K Camp]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I'm like eleven of them back give me that fucking walkie talkie
Then you lost me when you said you'd never cross me then you crossed me
And these hoes catch the vapors like Biz Markie
And since they brought me these keys, niggas idolize me
Critics criticize me, haters sabotage me
I get angry then I come through in a camouflaged v
Better recognize that my killers ain't gonna jeopardize me
I know these fuck niggas wish they could paralyze me

[Hook: K Camp]

[Big Meech talking]
Holiday season
This the New Year twenty twelve
The boss of all bosses
The real Big Meech
Rocking with the homies
Gucci let no man separate what we create
From every hood to Hollywood
Coming to a ghetto near you
Death this whole dishonor
The greatest show on earth
After us it will be no others
It is we got 'em
Death is streets on live homie
You know what I'm saying?
Keep doing what you doing
You know what I'm saying?
Because that's what time it is
We gotta keep the real out there pumping
Real is here to stay
When you're here to stay you ain't gotta come back
Free Big Meech and see the streets
Aka the BMF stimulus package one

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
My name is Gucci

Ain't you a rapper Gucci

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]

She said her man dont love her right

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
We fucked up

I got damn near 4 drugs all in one cup
Styrofoam cup it cost me like a hundred bucks
500 dollars everytime I'm pourin' up
300 dollar blunts when I'm rollin' up
I spent 2500 hundred I ain't even had my lunch
OG kush for breakfast for a champion my morning junt
Promethazine on everything I'm pouring lean on my Captain Crunch
Last 12 months not sober once
Which one of yall wanna have some fun
Get ya some on ya tongue need a liver and lung
Playing the guitar high off the same shit that Jimi Hendrix on
Smoking Chronic me and Snoop Lion need to get ya some
Clean bricks I remix me some
Licks out there hit more than 1
Syrup I get drowned upon but then in the mob it's frowned upon
He said he on cloud 9 but I dont know what cloud I'm on
Its Gucci Mane the Rasta man someone please roll the ganja man

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like
She said her man dont love her right
What kind of drugs you like
What kind of drugs you like

She said her man dont love her right
What kind of drugs you like

We in the club, we high off drugs tonight

She said her man dont love her right
We high off drugs tonight

[Verse]
Baby, I can look in the mirror and see
That I'm not the best looking man in the world, the world, the world
But if you can look past that in me
You'll see, girl, I'm the kind of man that takes care of his girl, his girl, his girl
You've been looking for love now, in all
In all the wrong places, I know, I know
I know what you're thinking of now, with all
With all these smiling faces, I know, know
You keep on wearing what you're wearing
And go for the best looking one that's staring
No, that's not right
'Cause you just passed the love of your life, I don't understand
Do you want something to look at?
Or do you want a man, man, man

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't have to look like him, to love you like me, me, me
I don't have to look like him, to love you like me, me, me
I probably fuck better than him and love you like me, me, me
I don't have to look like him, to love you, I, love you I love you, I love you, I, I love you, I love you, I love you like me

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Han

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
This fuck nigga keep on textin my phone
Saying what he gone do to me
I keep 2 pistols usually
These fuck niggas better bring 4 or 3
Bricksquad thats my faculty
Always keep the trap with me
Always keep the strap with me
Give a fuck if you dont do a song with me
Smoking on strong all day my nigga
Sippen on lean all evenin'
Fuck nigga test the Gucci Man have blood all on my Timberlands
Aye there go the Gucci Man
Do all yall remember him
My mom nigga has Sicilian but I naw I ain't never been to Italy
458 from Italy
M6 came from Germany
Zaytoven's my symphony
Young Jeezy my enemy
Some people say Im crazy and I might need to take some Ritalin
Sign black Migos Scooter so that makes Gucci a Mexican

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Spit in yo face
Fuck nigga I might spit in yo face

Im the type of nigga to spit in yo face
Gucci Mane a nasty nigga nigga I might just spit in yo face
Spit in yo face
Gucci Mane a nasty nigga fuck nigga I might spit in yo face

[Verse 1]
I never seem to finish all my food
I always get a doggie bag from the waiter
So I just keep what's still unchewed
And I take it home, save it for later

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But then I deal with fungal rot, bacterial formation
Microbes, enzymes, mold, and oxidation
I don't care; I've got a secret trick up my sleeve
I never bother with baggies, glass jars, Tupperware containers
Plastic cling wrap, really a no-brainer
I just like to keep all my flavors sealed in tight

[Chorus]
With aluminum foil (Foil)
Never settle for less
That kind of wrap is just the best
To keep your sandwich nice and fresh
Stick it in your cooler (Cooler)
Eat it when you're ready
But maybe you'll choose (You'll choose, you'll choose, you'll choose)
A refreshing herbal tea
Mmm, lovely!

[Verse 2]
Oh, by the way, I've cracked the code
I've figured out these shadow organizations
And the Illuminati know
That they're finally primed for world domination

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And soon you've got black helicopters comin' cross the border
Puppet masters for the New World Order
Be aware, there's always someone that's watching you
And still, the government won't admit they faked the whole moon landing
Thought-control rays, psychotronic scanning
Don't mind that, I'm protected 'cause I made this hat

[Chorus]
From aluminum foil (foil)
Wear a hat that's foil lined
In case an alien's inclined
To probe your butt or read your mind
Looks a bit peculiar ('culiar)
Seems a little crazy
But someday I'll prove (I'll prove, I'll prove, I'll prove)
There's a big conspiracy

[Intro]
Everybody shut up! (Woo!)
Everyone listen up!
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey (Uh, woo!)
Hey, hey, hey (Woo!)

[Verse 1]
If you can't write in the proper way (Woo!)
If you don't know how to conjugate (Woo!)
Hey, maybe you flunked that class (Hey, hey, hey)
And maybe now you find (Hey, hey, hey)
That people mock you online (Hey, hey, hey)
(Everybody wise up!)

[Verse 2]
Okay, now here's the deal
I'll try to educate ya (Woo!) (Ow!)
Gonna familiarize
You with the nomenclature (Woo!) (Meow!)
You'll learn the definitions (Hey, hey, hey)
Of nouns and prepositions (Hey, hey, hey)
Literacy's your mission (Hey, hey, hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's why I think it's a good time (Woo!)
To learn some grammar (What)
Now, did I stammer?
Work on that grammar (Woo!)
You should know when
It's "less" or it's "fewer" (Woo!) (Oh, yeah)
Like people who were (All right)
Never raised in a sewer

[Chorus 1]
I hate these word crimes
Like "I could care less" (Hey, hey, hey)
That means you do care (Whoa)
At least a little
Don't be a moron (Hey, hey)
You'd better slow down
And use the right pronoun (Hey, hey)
Show the world you're no clown
(Everybody wise up!)

[Verse 2]
Say you've got an "i-t"
Followed by apostrophe "s" (Woo!)
Now, what does that mean?
You would not use "it's" in this case (Woo!)
As a possessive (No, no, no!)
It's a contraction (Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
What's a contraction?
Well, it's the shortening of a word or a group of words
By omission of a sound or letter (Woo!)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Okay, now here are some notes
Syntax you're always mangling (Woo!)
No X in "espresso"
Your participle's danglin' (Uh-huh)
But I don't want your drama (Hey, hey, hey) (Uh-huh)
If you really wanna (Hey, hey, hey) (Uh-huh)
Leave out that Oxford comma (Hey, hey, hey) (Uh-huh)

[Chorus 2]
Just keep in mind that
"Be", "see", "are", "you"
Are words, not letters (Woo!)
Get it together (Hey, hey)
Use your spell checker
You should never
Write words using numbers (Woo!) (Hey, hey)
Unless you're seven (Yeah-ay)
Or your name is Prince
(Everybody wise up!)

[Chorus 1]
I hate these word crimes (I hate them crimes)
You really need a (Woo!) (I hate them crimes)
Full-time proofreader (I mean those crimes)
You dumb mouth-breather (Woo!)
Well, you should hire (I'll hire)
Some cunning linguist (Woo!)
To help you distinguish
What is proper English
(Everybody wise up!)

[Bridge]
One thing I ask of you (Okay)
Time to learn your homophones is past due (Woo!)
Learn to diagram a sentence, too
Always say "to whom", don't ever say "to who" (Woo!)
And listen up when I tell you this
I hope you never use quotation marks for emphasis (Woo!)
You finished second grade, I hope you can tell
If you're doing good or doing well (Woo!)
You better figure out the difference
Irony is not coincidence (Woo!)
And I thought that you'd gotten it through your skull
About what's figurative and what's literal (Woo!)
Oh, but just now (Just now), you said (You said)
You "literally" couldn't get out of bed (Woo!) (What?)
That really makes me want to literally
Smack a crowbar upside your stupid head

[Pre-Chorus]
I read your e-mail (Yeah, yeah)
It's quite apparent (Woo!)
Your grammar's errant
You're incoherent (Woo!)
Saw your blog post (Hey, hey)
It's really fantastic (Oh, woah)
That was sarcastic (Oh, psych!)
'Cause you write like a spastic (Woo!)

[Chorus 1]
I hate these word crimes (Everybody wise up)
Your prose is dopey (Woo!) (Hey)
Think you should only (Woah, woah)
Write in emoji (Woo!)
Oh, you're a lost cause (Hey, hey, hey)
Go back to preschool (Woo!)
Get out of the gene pool (Hey, hey, hey)
Try your best to not drool (Woo!)

[Outro]
Never mind, I give up (Woo!)
Really now, I give up (Woo!)
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Go away!

[Verse 1]
First things first, I'm a craftsman (Craftsman)
Remodelling is my only passion (It's my passion)
And I'm the greatest in the business
Want referrals, yo
My clientèle will bear you witness (Right, right)
I can help when your door jamb sticks (heh?)
There is nothing in the world I can't fix (yeah)
I do tiles, I do stone, I do bricks
Call me, I'll come rushing over with my bag of tricks (bag of tricks)
Where you go when your disposal is rusted (rusted)
Termite problem making you disgusted (yuck)
When your front window is busted (hey hey hey)
Just one name that's always trusted

[Chorus]
I'm so handy, you alrea
