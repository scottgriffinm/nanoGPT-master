To you it's never hard to walk away
Purple clouded pain
Harder everyday to fall for you, ooh
This heart beats harder everyday
Harder everyday, harder everyday
I still see through
To you it's never hard to walk away
Purple clouded pain
Harder everyday to fall for you, ooh

[Verse]
Niggas be thinkin' I'm deep, intelligent, fooled by my college degree
My IQ is average, there's a young lady out there, she way smarter than me
I scrolled through her timeline in these wild times, and I started to read
She mad at these crackers, she mad at these capitalists, mad at these murder police
She mad at my niggas, she mad at our ignorance, she wear her heart on her sleeve
She mad at the celebrities, lowkey I be thinkin' she talkin' 'bout me
Now I ain't no dummy to think I'm above criticism
So when I see something that's valid, I listen
But shit, it's something about the queen tone that's botherin' me
She strike me as somebody blessed enough to grow up in conscious environment
With parents that know 'bout the struggle for liberation and in turn they provide her with
A perspective and awareness of the system and unfairness that afflicts 'em
And the clearest understandin' of what we gotta do to get free
And the frustration that fills her words seems to come from the fact that most people don't see
Just 'cause you woke and I'm not, that shit ain't no reason to talk like you better than me
How you gon' lead, when you attackin' the very same niggas that really do need the shit that you sayin'?
Instead of conveyin' you holier, come help us get up to speed
Shit, it's a reason it took like two hundred years for our ancestors just to get freed
These shackles be lockin' the mental way more than the physical
I look at freedom like trees, can't grow a forest like overnight
Hit the ghetto and slowly start plantin' your seeds
Fuck is the point of you preaching your message to those that already believe what you believe?
I'm on some "Fuck a retweet," most people is sheep
You got all the answers but how you gon' reach?
If I could make one more suggestion respectfully
I would say it's more effective to treat people like children
Understandin' the time and love and patience that's needed to grow
This change is inevitable, but ain't none of us seen this before
Therefore, we just gotta learn everything as we go
I struggle with thoughts on the daily
Feel like a slave that somehow done saved enough coins to buy his way up outta slavery
Thinkin' just maybe, in my pursuit to make life so much better for me and my babies
I done betrayed the very same people that look at me like I'm some kind of a hero
Because of the zeros that's next to the commas
But look here, I promise I'm not who you think
Ran into this nigga outside of the store yesterday
He said something that had me like, "Wait"
He was like, "Cole, 'preciate what you been doin', my nigga, that's real"
But damn, why I feel faker than Snow on tha Bluff?
Well, maybe 'cause deep down I know I ain't doin' enough

[Bridge]
The sun is shinin' today
The sun is shinin' today
The sun is shinin' today

[Outro]
Can you walk with me?
I hope we'll find the reason why we often sob, go on, cry
Painful memories fuck up the vibe
Though I be tryin' to let the time heal my mind
I was once a child, I've gotten older
Still, I know I'm just a boy in God's eyes
Fill me up with wisdom and some courage
Plus endurance to survive, help mine thrive
But they don't hear me though (uh huh)
Niggas don't hear me though 2x

(DMX)
Niggas wanna shout, I'ma make noise
Niggas run they mouth, I'm a break jaws
Niggas coming out, I'm a take yours
School Street, home of the brave nigga, we make wars
Stuck in the cage, where do we turn
Niggas spending time on the streets, where do we learn
Who gonna be there to teach em, reach em when they in trouble
Bark up at your dog, cause we all up in the struggle
The change in collars is coming with brains and scholars
We gonna get it on baby, until it rains in dollars
Rotweilers ain't got nothing on the Pit
Putting on the rips, why y'all niggas frontin on the grits
We can all eat or we can all sleep
We can pull heat with the full heat or make it all sweet
We all deep, since you best at getting touched, leave it alone
Cause dog, If I wanted you last month, you would've been blown
My nigga T.P. creep with me, frequently
Two deep with me, secretly, evilly
Problem solved, shit resolved, next issue
Baby nine on the ankle, in case the Tecs miss you
Hit you, ready for war, ready for more, you ain't afraid to die
But this pistol in your mouth got you afraid to lie
Buh-bye, see you in Hell until I get there, sit there
I'm a hit there, about when you in your fifth year, shit yeah
(DMX)
I always catch a nigga blind in the fog
Talent of a God, mind of a dog
When it's on it's on, it don't matter
Cause y'all niggas chatter, my niggas splatter
Thought you was badder, well my dogs thought otherwise
Screaming like a bitch oh you thought we was those other guys
Nigga tried to snitch, ran home and told his mother lies
But fucking with this clique is one sure why a brother dies
Who gonna pay respects, when you laying in that box
Playing with The L.O.X, DMX will spray the spot
That'll make it hot, I torch when I touch
Let me loose, your arm is coming off when I bust
Dusk back to Dusk, you going out the way you came in
And you must've flipped once the way you was layin
And now your momma prayin, you better off in death than in life
But you in Hell, wishing you had stepped towards the light
Now you know, but it's too late
Niggas don't hear me though, 'til it's too late
All that "I'm sorry, yo I didn't know"
Is a waste of breath when your man is laying up in different clothes
Body full of holes, and I'm a man of my word
Told me he would get it, as he ran from the curb
Think it's a fucking joke, you can get it like he got it
Spot right next to his, same grave, read about it

[Verse 1]
You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me
She's saying: "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need."
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says: "There's no turning back."
She trapped me in her heart

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no, oh no, oh no

[Verse 2]
She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree
She's saying: "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star."

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

[Interlude]

Dirty Diana
It's Diana, -iana, -iana
C'mon!

[Verse 3]
She said: "I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said: "My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright."
Diana walked up to me
She said: "I'm all yours tonight."
At that I ran to the phone
Saying, "Baby, I'm alright."
I said: "But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key."
She said: "He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me."

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

C'mon!

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yo, yo Drew and Inf
This-this, this right here is crazy
Yo I, I feel big, you know what I mean?
Like, not, not big in the sense of, weight
You know what I mean? Like gainin' weight or nothin' like that
Like colossal
Like, you know what I mean, like (sighs)
I heard you were lookin' for me

[Chorus: Sha-Ron Prescott & Lil Wayne]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hello)
Tell me, where have you been? (Haha, you know, hehe)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (I know, haha)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hey, hello)
Tell me, where have you been? (Shit, you know)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Hahahah)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]

[Chorus: Sha-Ron Prescott & Lil Wayne]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hello!)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world and I'm back again!
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin', hah!)
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him!)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world now I'm back again!
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin', hah!)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I been in and out the bank, bitch
While y'all asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush and watch 'em go down the drain quick
Two words you never hear: "Wayne quit!?"
Cause Wayne win, and they lose
I call 'em April babies, 'cause they fools
And when they snooze, we up!
Feet up, like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old-school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream "Soo-woo" and "Da-da-doe"
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there
Long hair, don't even care

[Chorus: Sha-ron Prescott & JAY-Z]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Young! I am him)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world now I'm back again
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin')
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him)
Tell me, where have you been?
Around the world now I'm back again
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
Who's been askin' about me?
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin', chyeah)

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I'm right here in my chair with my crown and my dear
Queen B, as I share, mic time with my heir
Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
It's my go, yeah… And I'ma go so opposite-of-soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, "What up, killa?" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy, Baby!

[Chorus: Sha-Ron Prescott, Lil Wayne & Choir]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Yeah)
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Haha)

[Outro]
Go get em’

[Chorus]
You should've been downtown (Word)
The people are risin' (For real?)
We thought it was a lockdown (What?)
They opened the fire (Man)
Them bullets was flyin' (Ooh)
Who said it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie

[Verse 1]
Oh my
Time heals all, but you out of time now (Now)
Judge gotta watch us from the clock tower (True)
Lil' tear gas cleared the whole place out
I'll be back with the hazmat for the next round
We was tryna protest, then the fires broke out
Look out for the secret agents, they be planted in the crowd
Said, "It's civil unrest," but you sleep so sound
Like you don't hear the screams when we catchin' beatdowns?
Stayin' quiet when they killin' niggas, but you speak loud
When we riot, got opinions comin' from a place of privilege
Sicker than the COVID how they did him on the ground
Speakin' of the COVID, is it still goin' around?
And won't you tell me 'bout the lootin'? What's that really all about?
'Cause they throw away black lives like paper towels
Plus unemployment rate, what, forty million now?
Killed a man in broad day, might never see a trial
We just wanna break chains like slaves in the South
Started in the North End but we in the downtown
Riot cops tried to block, now we got a showdown
(Citizens of Los Angeles) Down
(I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly)
(And in the name of the people of the State of California)

[Chorus]
You should've been downtown (Command all those assembled)
The people are risin' (Right here)
We thought it was a lockdown
They opened the fire (Ooh)
Them bullets was flyin'
(Lockdown, we ain't gotta stop because they tell us to)
Who said it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie

[Post-Chorus]
Downtown, where I got popped with the rubber bullet
Trey-pound, got it in my name now, I'ma shoot it

[Verse 2]
Uh, okay, never understand why they do it
Someone cut the channel off the news 'fore I lose it (Nah)
I ain't even trippin', if you wit' it, then we lootin' (Nah)
Help me put this Louis in the back of Suzuki (Ooh), o-he
Had to break it down so smoothly (Smooth)
They gon' say, "It's not about race," but we movin' (Fuckin') ho, power
Copped the trey-pound, had to put that in my name
Wish a nigga play now (Yeah)
Any given day, I'll be headed to the pulpits (Yeah)
Say a lil' prayer, matter fact, I need two of 'em, ooh
Won't he do it? Won't he do it?
Ooh, this ain't '92 so we into new rules
Niggas got hip, so we don't loot the projects
'Bout to hit Rodeo with my lil' cousin Marcus
Someone threw a whole brick in the Neiman Marcus (Ah)
Help me put the whole mannequin in the Charger

[Chorus]
You should've been downtown (Down)
The people are risin' (Look around)
We thought it was a lockdown (Shit, lockdown)
They opened the fire (Had to get low, fire)
Them bullets was flyin' (Down, down)
Who said it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie (Ooh-wee)

[Post-Chorus]
Lockdown, we ain't gotta stop 'cause they tell us to
Downtown, where I got popped with the rubber bullet
Trey-pound, got it in my name now (Uh), I'ma shoot it
Lockdown, we ain't gotta stop 'cause they tell us to
Downtown

[Verse 1]
Simple walk to the corner store
Mama never thought she would be gettin' a call from the coroner
Said her son's been gunned down, been gunned down
"Can you come now?"
Tears in her eyes, "Can you calm down?
Please, ma'am, can you calm down?"

[Pre-Chorus]
But it rained fire in the city that day, they say
A river of blood in the streets
No love in the streets
And then came silence in the city that day, they say
Just another one gone
And they tell her move on

[Chorus]
And she's stuck there, singing
"Baby, don't you close your eyes
This could be our final time
And you know I'm horrible at saying goodbye
And I think of all you coulda done
At least you'll stay forever young
I guess you picked the perfect way to die
Oh, I guess you picked the perfect way to die"

[Verse 2]
New job, new city, new her
Bright-eyed, you would have been proud if you knew her
Flashing lights in the mirror, pull over, pull over
A couple nights in detention and it's over, a whole life's over

[Pre-Chorus]
They came marching in the city that day, they say
Carryin' signs in the streets
Cryin' eyes in the streets
But they heard nothing from the city that day, they say
Just another one gone
And the city moved on

[Chorus]
We're stuck here singing
"Baby, don't you close your eyes
'Cause this could be our final time
And you know I'm horrible at saying goodbye
I'll think of all you coulda done
At least you'll stay forever young
I guess you picked the perfect way to die
Oh, I guess you picked the perfect way to die"

[Bridge]
Another dream lost
Another king and queen lost
Another broken promise they refuse to make right
Oh, another night to live in fear
Oh, another night that you're not here
Another reason to get out there and fight

[Chorus]
But I said, "Baby, don't you close your eyes
'Cause this could be our final time
And you know I'm horrible at saying goodbye
But I'll think of all you coulda done
At least you'll stay forever young
I guess you picked the perfect way to die
Oh, I guess you picked the perfect way..."

[Verse]
Come they told me, pa rum pum pum pum
A new born King to see, pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the King, pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum
The streets is crazy, pa rum pum pum pum (streets is crazy)
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pum pum pum (oh what can I get you)
Thou I would say something, pa rum pum pum pum (oh)
To represent our King, pa rum pum pum pum
What have I done? What have I done?
Kanye, can I talk to you for a minute?
Me 'n the other faculty members was wonderin'
Could you do a lil some, somethin' beautiful?
Somethin' that the kids is gon' love when they hear it
It's gonna make 'em start jumpin' up 'n down and sharin' candy and stuff
Think you could probably do somethin' for the kids for graduation to sing?
Every time you touch her
Sets your hands on fire
And every thing you've got
Is all that she requires

And you hang on, hang on, hang on
To the words of a liar
You can feel it getting
Down to the wire

All the hurt you thought was gone
Has now returned
And every thing she's laughing at
Is all you learned

And you let go, let go, let go
'cause you know you're getting tired
Can you feel it getting
Down to the wire?

Take the time to close your
Eyes and look around
'Cause anyone who helped you out
Can let you down
And look out, look out, look out
The voice is now the choir
Can you feel it getting
Down to the wire?

[Verse 1]
Lover, there will be another one
Who'll hover over you beneath the sun
Tomorrow, see the things that never come today

[Chorus]
When you see me fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over, it's over

[Verse 2]
Nestled in your wings, my little one
Is special, morning brings another sun
Tomorrow, see the things that never come today

[Chorus]
When you see me fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over, it's over

[Verse 1]
Old man lying by the side of the road
With the lorries rolling by
Blue moon sinking from the weight of the load
And the buildings scrape the sky
Cold wind ripping down the alley at dawn
And the morning paper flies
Dead man lying by the side of the road
With the daylight in his eyes

[Chorus]
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around

[Verse 2]
Blind man running through the light of the night
With an answer in his hand
Come on down to the river of sight
And you can really understand
Red lights flashing through the window in the rain
Can you hear the sirens moan?
White cane lying in a gutter in the lane
If you're walking home alone

[Chorus]
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around

[Chorus]
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around

[Chorus]
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around
Look at the average person
Speak to the man in the street
Can you imagine the first one you'd meet?
Look at the average person
Speak to the man in the street
You can imagine the first one you'd meet

Talking to a former engine driver
Trying to find out what he used to do
Tells me that he always kept his engine
Spit and polished up as good as new
But he said his only great ambition
Was to work with lions in a zoo
Oh, to work with lions in a zoo
Yes dear, you heard right
Told me his ambition was to work with lions every night

Look at the average person
Speak to the man on the beat
Can you imagine the first one you'd meet?
Met a woman working as a waitress
I asked exactly what it was she did
Said she worked the summer crowd at seasides
Winter time she ran away and hid
Once she had a Hollywood audition
But the part was given to a kid
Yes, the part was given to a kid
Yes sir, you heard right
Hollywood ambition made a starlet grow up overnight

Look at the average person
Speak to the man in the street

Well, I bumped into a man who'd been a boxer
Asked him what had been his greatest night
He looked into the corners of his memory
Searching for a picture of a fight
But he said he always had a feeling
That might have lacked a little height
Could've used a little extra height
Yes mate, you heard right
He always had a feeling that he might have lacked a little height

Look at the average person
Love, I'm going to pick you up in the morning
I'm going to take you off on a journey
I don't know where I'm going to
But I know what I've been going through
Without you by my side

What good is butter if you haven't got bread?
What good is art when it hurts your head?
Might as well be in bed
Keep under cover till the battle has ceased
Keep out of trouble till the prisoners are released

What good's a puzzle when you haven't a clue?
What good is me when I'm not with you?
Might as well stay in bed
Keep under cover 'til the clouds disappear
Keep out of trouble 'til the weather is bright and clear

Love, I'm going to pick you up
Love, I'm going to take you off on a journey
I don't know what I'm gonna do
But I know what I've been going through
Without you by my side
Without you by my side
What good is butter if you haven't got bread?
What good is art when it hurts your head?
Might as well be in bed
Keep under cover till the battle has ceased
Keep out of trouble till the prisoners are released

I'm going to pick you up
I'm going to take you off on a journey
I don't know what I'm gonna do
But I know what I've been going through
Without you by my side
Without you by my side

Keep under cover till the battle has ceased
Keep out of trouble till the prisoners are released

I'm going to pick you up in the morning
I'm going to take you off on a journey
I don't know what I'm gonna do
But I know what I've been going through
Without you by my side
Without you by my side

What good's a puzzle when you haven't a clue?
What good is me when I'm not with you?
Might as well stay in bed
Keep under cover 'til the clouds disappear
Keep out of trouble 'til the weather is bright and clear
Now, love, I'm going to pick you up
I'm going to take you out
I'm going to pick you up
I'm going to take you out
Well, if they treat you like a brother
Then they can treat you like a clown
But if they treat you like a lover
They've got the sweetest little show in town

You got the sweetest little show
Sweetest little show
Sweetest little show in town

You've been around a long time
But you're still good for a while
And if they try to criticize you
Make them smile, make them smile

'cause if they treat you like a brother
Well you will never, never let them down
But if they treat you like a lover

They've got the sweetest little show in town
You got the sweetest little show
Sweetest little show
Sweetest little show in town
You've been around a long time
But you're still good for a while
And if they try to criticize you
Make them smile, oh, make them smile

'cause if they treat you like a brother
And they treat you like a clown
But if they treat you like a lover

They've got the sweetest little show in town
You got the sweetest little show
Sweetest little show
Sweetest little show in town

You got the sweetest little show in town
Take your hand off my knee, young man
Said the lady in green
I don't care to come in between you and your young woman
It's just not done

Couldn't we pass up?
Couldn't we fold?
Aren't certain stories best left untold?
Some things like buttons are best left undone
It's not on

Arnie Pupe is a normal type with an average job
But his prospects will never be great
While bosses underestimate his value
Arnie says

Irene E is his fiancee
And she'd hate to disagree
But the company she thinks is fair
Arnie never does get anywhere
Take your feet off my desk, young man
Said the chauffeur in gray
My green woman has been to seen me
She's retreating from your advance

Wouldn't you join us?
When can you start up as a driver looking the part?
Hang on says Arnie
This just isn't done
It's not on, It's not on, It's not on
Hang on says Arnie
This just isn't done

Couldn't we pass up?
Couldn't we fold?
Aren't certain stories best left untold?
Some things like buttons are best left undone
It's not on, It's not on, It's not on
Some things like buttons are best left undone

It's not on
Cause you'd have seen by the ring
By the way, by the way that I

Can’t you see, ni-ni-night?

How many times have you seen?
Only once in a lifetime does it happen
But you know when you've seen it
Seen it, seen it, seen it
Only once in a lifetime

It's as simple as that, simple as that
Simple as that, it’s as simple as that

How many times in a lifetime have you seen it on your front door
You were looking out til somebody looking out stopped
When they know how many times you have looked into the right
And looked into the left
How long do you think it's gonna take?

If you were left to your own devices
Overnight, you'd become something else
It's as simple as that, it's as simple as that
It's as simple as that, it's as simple as that

I’m the type of guy you don’t want to fuck with dawg
Your bitch is my pawg put this shit on pause
Like it cause I’m rhyming’ every word that’s hard
Why complain bout the rhythm when I got these bars (huh)
I’m still me doesn’t matter what I do or charge
You’re still tryin’ to find a meaning to your life and scars
I don’t fake the message I lay it hard
And I don’t regret shit
I came with bars you just keep on hatin’
I’m getting far, no lies motherfucker i keep it strong cause I had nobody to teach me all
Still rap because I’m still geek’n
I ain’t the one you want so stop creepin’
Bitch you postin’ status bout preachin’
And I don’t see nobody healin’ somebody so don’t talk to me about switchin’
I’m just bein’ fuckin’ real look at my skills
Shout out to the homie lil wayne, that’s chill
Pockets lookin’ fat but I still need mils
You can’t fuck with a nigga that’s been too real
I’ll hop on any beat produce by ills
Come catch my shade and get the L’s
Nigga you worthless keep the fuck off my bills
She tryin’ to get me like Tory lanez that’s ewww

[Nicki Minaj: 2nd Verse]
I'm in this bitch I'm high-saditty
I popped a Perc and I said thank you
I'm popping tags everyday, it look like my B-Day
These bitches suck, so I nickname these bitches BJ
They want that union, they want that D. Wade
I tell a ho just be happy they getting leeway
My name Barbie, bitch (my name Barbie, bitch)
Alexander, made me Queen
I'm pulling up with the King, I'm late to my own party, bitch
Want it, I get it, I don't be wanting for nothing
I mean, I do what I do and it must be counting for something
I don't be jumping from topic to topic, stay in my pocket
I got your rent in my pocket, so can I pay you to pop it?
Cash Money, getting six albums
No bitch niggas on a bitch album
You niggas apologize when a nigga diss you?
That's a big problem

Even if you cannot stay
I think you are the one for me
Here is where you ought to be
I just want to satisfy you
But you're not mine, I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talking, baby?
Love me now, or I'll go crazy

Oh oh, sweet thing
Oh, you know you're my everything
Oh oh, sweet thing

I wish you were my lover
Act so undercover
To love you, child, my whole life long
Be it right or be it wrong
I'm only what you make me, baby
Walk away, don't be so shady
I don't want your mind, don't want your money
These words I say, they may sound funny but
Oh oh, sweet thing
Oh, you know you're my everything
Oh oh, sweet thing
Oh, don’t you know you're my everything

You are my heat, you are my fire
You make me weep with strong desire
To love you, child, my whole life long
Be it right or be it wrong
I just want to satisfy ya
Though you're not mine, I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talking, baby?
Love me now, or I'll go crazy

[Verse 1]
You don't know but I've been doing fine
Seems I'm looking at the moon tonight
I don't care what she's gonna do tonight, rollin'
Look now, Molly since you said goodbye
Here I've been thinking, and wonderin' why
I know it's alright but I don't cry, no

[Chorus]
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

[Chorus]
Rock me mama through the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel

Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel

[Verse 2]
Moonshine running on the Rio Grande
Stars lie dotted on the promised land
It's all well talkin' and understandin', rollin'
When I'm looking on the road tonight
The moon is shining on a cold dark night
And oh that feeling, I know

[Chorus]
Rock me mama through the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train

[Intro: Gucci Mane & Lil Yachty]
1209 Squeeze (Hah)
30, you a motherfuckin' fool, nigga
(Yah, yah, yah, yah)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I had to laugh (Go), it kept me from cryin' (Go)
Said it was all good, but I was lyin' (Lyin')
Stood on my ten and I did my time (My ten)
I done seen all these niggas switch sides (Yeah)
I know what's up with these guys (What's up with these guys?)
They hate in disguise, dick ridin's at an all-time high (Ridin')
Just by the watches I buy and the jets that I fly (Brr)
Like I'm up, like I'm stuck in the sky (Woo)
I came up robbin', starvin', Sun Valley 'partments
Copped the MARTA with some pennies (Yeah)
Handled my business, I swear that I hustled relentless
Bipolar from all of the killings (Blam)
Dope I was whippin', Ma tried to whip me (Skrrt)
She gave me a fifty for Christmas (Mama), I flipped it (Huh?)
Still can't forget it, wearin' my brother's clothes I couldn't fit in (My bro)
We still got evicted (Damn)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Car was so raggedy, it was embarrassin'
It was impairin', I'm blamin' my parents
Rode on Macleans before the McLaren (Macleans)
I had them starin' all down Maynard Terrace (Skrrt, skrrt)
Did it myself, ain't no blemish on my rep (Did it myself)
You can come see for yourself (Pow)
Watch where you step, mumblin' under your breath
I'll hold a grudge 'til the death
Come by myself, I don't need nobody help (Nobody help)
I'll blaze you up like I'm chef (I don't need nobody help)
Shoot 'til it emp' (Bow-bow-bow-bow), I shoot a hundred like Wilt
You keep a 30 like Steph
You better dip, mask on my face like I'm Rip
Cash cover me like a quilt (Rippy)
I come equipped, blue tips inside of my clip
You'd think my gun was a Crip (Flippa)
Drive-by, walk by, bicycle, motorcycle
Killers pullin' up in all kinds (Bow)
Fourteen, fifteen, twelve-years-old
Young nigga slangin' iron at nine (Well, damn)
Young nigga stackin' it proud, trappin' it loud
He threw a stack in the crowd
I say they jackin' my style, crackin' a smile (Hahaha)
But I ain't sold crack in a while (Skrrt, skrrt)
I got a biblical past (Huh?), digital dash
Scale with a digital dial (Skippy)
Really put dope in the vial (Really), hid work in the towel
I put that shit on the Bible
Servin' my cous' outta town (Go, tree)
They said I was devilish 'cause I wouldn't go to revival (Tree)
Gucci Mane talk of the town
Now (Tree), when I touch down, I'm sellin' a brick on arrival (Sorry)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I had to laugh (Go), it kept me from cryin' (Go)
Said it was all good, but I was lyin' (Lyin')
Stood on my ten and I did my time (Ten)
I done seen all these niggas switch sides (Yeah)
I know what's up with these guys (What's up with these guys?)
They hate in disguise, dick ridin's at an all-time high (Ridin')
Just by the watches I buy and the jets that I fly (Brr)
Like I'm up, like I'm stuck in the sky (Woo)
I came up robbin', starvin', Sun Valley 'partments
Copped the MARTA with some pennies (Yeah)
Handled my business, I swear that I hustled relentless
Bipolar from all of the killings (Great)
Dope I was whippin', Ma tried to whip me (Mama)
She gave me a fifty for Christmas, I flipped it (Huh?)
Still can't forget it, wearin' my brother's clothes I couldn't fit in (My bro)
We still got evicted (Damn)

[Verse 2: Pooh Shiesty]
Remember them days (Days) I was stuck in the creek (Creek)
I had somewhere to sleep, but I didn't have a bed (No, I didn't have me a bed)
Jumped off the porch, I wasn't going for shit (Not shit)
Had to tackle the block just to get me some bread (Trappin' was keepin' us fed)
I was the man of the house, had to figure shit out
Every time Pops went to the feds (Every time he went to the feds)
Had a deuce-five with no clip, I was bustin' that bitch
I was constantly puttin' one in the head (Constantly puttin' one in the head)
Now we got choppas with lasers and beams
We 375 (Brrt), 1017 (Brrt, brrt, brrt)
Wop came and got me, this shit ain't no dream
Big Shiesty and Gucci like Shaq and Kareem (Gucci like Shaq and Kareem)
I got up and took it, couldn't wait on a blessing (Come here)
Shakin' them dice, tryna roll me a seven
They threw the police on me at eleven
I been causin' hell, quick to send you to heaven (Quick to go send you to heaven, brrt)
Can't wait 'til Wop point you out 'cause I'm ready (Go)
Might rob a rapper right after a session (Let's go)
Give me them keys and that watch and that necklace (Brrt)
I need them Cuban links and them baguettes
Ain't no more postin' on IG and flexin' (Nope)
I'm the one rappin' but steady be steppin' (Know I'm the one that be steppin')
I'm comin' late in your dream like I'm Freddy (Like huh?)
How you gon' run from a automatic weapon? (How you gon' run from a brrt?)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I had to laugh, it kept me from cryin' (Lyin')
Said it was all good, but I was lyin' (Ten)
Stood on my ten and I did my time (Yeah)
I done seen all these niggas switch sides
I know what's up with these guys
They hate in disguise, dick ridin's at an all-time high (Brr)
Just by the watches I buy and the jets that I fly (Woo)
Like I'm up, like I'm stuck in the sky
I came up robbin', starvin', Sun Valley 'partments (Yeah)
Copped the MARTA with some pennies
Handled my business, I swear that I hustled relentless (Great)
Bipolar from all of the killings (Skrrt)
Dope I was whippin' (Ma), Ma tried to whip me (Huh?)
She gave me a fifty for Christmas, I flipped it
Still can't forget it (My bro), wearin' my brother's clothes I couldn't fit in
We still got evicted (It's Gucci)

[Verse 1]
I need some recovery
Don't wanna make this messy
Push and pull again as you untie the ends
Baby, I need some recovery

[Verse 2]
Harder and harder to sleep
You're weighing heavy on me
Try and I try, can't push it aside
It's harder and harder to sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you, do you know the things you do to me?
Do you, do you know the way that you sit on my couch
Staring silently, burning a hole in the wall

[Chorus]
Really got me
Where you want me
With my head just
Above the deep
Hear the sirens
Silent crying
Hard to be here
When you don't see me

[Verse 3]
Stuck in that weird in-between
Running through old memories
Felt it for ages, on different pages
Stuck in that weird in-between

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you, do you know the things you do to me?
Do you, do you know the way that you sit on my couch
Staring silently, burning a hole in the wall
While I'm trying to fix this, do you even care?

[Chorus]
Really got me
Where you want me
With my head just
Above the deep
Hear the sirens
Silent crying
Hard to be here
When you don't see me

[Outro]
I need some recovery
Don't wanna make this messy
Push and pull again as you untie the ends
Baby, I need some recovery

[Verse 1]
I don't drive a beautiful car
I don't own an elegant home
I don't have thousands to spend
Or a seaside cottage for the weekend

[Chorus]
Just an ordinary, ordinary guy
Afro-Filipino, average sort of guy
That's what I am
Ordinary man you left behind

[Verse 2]
Exclusive nightclubs are out of style with me
'Cause I don't associate with high society
I don't hang around playboy millionaires
I'm just an ordinary guy you left behind

[Chorus]
I'm just an ordinary, ordinary guy
Afro-Filipino, average sort of guy
Ordinary, ordinary guy
Afro-Filipino, average sort of guy
That's what I am
Ordinary man you left behind

[Intro]
Well, here's a song now
This is about a man in jail out there you probably have heard of
We're tryna get him out of jail

[Verse 1]
Pistol shots ring out on a barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the outer hall
She sees a bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, "My God, they've killed them all"
Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time, he could've been
The champion of the world

[Verse 2]
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
And another man named Bello moving mysteriously
"I didn't do it," he says, and he throws up his hands
"I was only robbing the register, you understand?"
"I saw them leaving," he says, and he stops
"One of us had better call on the cops"
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing
In the hot New Jersey night

[Verse 3]
Meanwhile, far away, in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson, that's the way things go
If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street
'Less you want to draw the heat

[Verse 4]
Alfred Bello, he had this rap on the cops
He and Arthur Dexter Bradley were in here prowling around
He saw two men running out of here, they looked like middleweights
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead"
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him he could identify the guilty men

[Verse 5]
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dying eye
Says, "Why'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy"
Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been
The champion of the world

[Verse 6]
Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin's in South America fighting for his name
Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for someone to blame
"Remember that murder that happened in a bar?"
"Remember you said you saw the getaway car?"
"You think you'd like to play ball with the law?"
"Think it might've been that fighter that you saw running that night?"
"Don't forget now, you're white"

[Verse 7]
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure"
Cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job, we're talking to your friend Bello
You don't want to have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow
You'll be doing society a favor
That son of a bitch is brave and getting braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no Gentleman Jim"

[Verse 8]
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
Never did like to talk about it all that much
"It's my work," he'd say, "I do it for pay
And when it's over, I'd just as soon go on my way"
Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jailhouse
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse

[Verse 9]
All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched, he was a revolutionary bum
And to the black folks, he was just a crazy nigger
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed

[Verse 10]
Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder one, guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley, and they both lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed
To live in a land where justice is a game

[Verse 11]
Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell
That's the story of the Hurricane
But it won't be over 'til they clear his name
And give him back the time he's done
Put in a prison cell, but one time
He could've been the champion of the world

[Verse 1]
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time, let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry, 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've learned the meaning to your story
And it is enough love for me to stay
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
Well, it's not my thing trying to get back
But this time, let me tell you where I'm at

[Chorus]
I want to, want to be where you are, oh-oh
Anywhere you are, oh-oh
I want to, want to be where you are, oh-oh
Everywhere you are, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Please don't close the door to our future
There are so many things we haven't tried
I will love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside

[Chorus]
I want to, want to be where you are, oh-oh
Any, any, anywhere you are, oh-oh
I want to, want to be where you are, oh-oh
I gotta, gotta be where you are, oh-oh

[Outro]
I want to be, I want to be, oh
Yeah, yeah, baby, now
I want to be, I want to be, oh
Ooh
I want to be, I want to be, oh
Nah, nah, yeah, yeah
I want to be, I want to be, oh
I want to be, I want to be, oh
Nah, nah, baby
I want to be, I want to be, oh
I want to be, I want to be, oh
Ooh, ooh, baby
I want to be, I want to, oh

[Verse 1]
Ah-ha-ha, yeah
Summer Breeze, all in my mind
Ah-ha, yeah
Summer Breeze, all in my mind
No-no-no-no, it's all in my mind
No-no-no-no, it's all in my mind

[Hook]
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' though the jasmine in my mind

[Verse 2]
See the curtains hangin' in the window
In the evening on a Friday night
A little light shinin' through the window
Lets me know every-everything's all right

[Hook]
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' though the jasmine in my mind

[Verse 3]
Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom
July is dressed up and playing her tune
When I come home from a hard day's work
And you're waitin' there
Not a care in the world

See the smile awaitin' in the kitchen
Through cookin' and the plates for two
Feel the arms that reach out to hold me
In the evening when the day is through

[Hook]
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' though the jasmine in my mind

[Break]
Ah, summer breeze

Me and Weezy Blood brothers, we got red Ferraris
Red tops in the hood, red tops on Bacardi
Red tops on top models at the after party
Before S dot Carter was Brooklyn's step-father
I was getting G money like Nino at the Carter
I was just a baby, like the face on the third Carter
Even had a baby face, like Tracy Evan's baby father
Nigga, so you know what I mean
When I say I get the money like a money machine, yeah

But when I'm in New Orleans, you can call it Chris Paul-in'

We be soakin' up syrup like a waffle house apron
Infrared beam go back to the basement
I'mma street king, ask dude from the Matrix

Translation, it's Freddy versus Jason
Who your favorite rapper, me and Weezy will erase them
And if they gettin' money then, we will paper chase them
With beams that glow in the dark like Kanye's stage shit
Then we highjackin' Kanye's spaceship
And land it on the Red Carpet at the VMA's bitch

[Interlude]
Dro, fuck with me! Yeah

[Verse 1]
Live from the 504
It's Mr. Crazy Flow
Jumping like a bungee, no rope
Even in the dungeon I glow
Even if it ain't sunny I glow
If it ain't about money I go –
Nowhere, I'm nailed to the floor
Money controls where I go
It is the sail to my boat
And it's going down
It's going down like there's a whale in the boat
See, you can smell that I smoke
And yep, I sip that lean
You hit me with that combination, it make my eyes bleed
I'm a shark in the water, yep, I swim with the big
So I don't have time to deal with Willy the Squid
L-L-Lilly pad niggas, l-l-look at the monster
Y-Y-You don't want to crash, like La-La-La Bamba
See it's me, Roney, and Terry
And my new drop is berry
Watermelon, plum, just call it fruit punch
I'm an old rapper getting new bucks
And all you new rappers, you're just new lunch

[Chorus]
Live from the 504
Live from the 504
Live from the 504

Live from the 504
Live from the 504

[Verse 2]
Flow sick, so sick, need a doc, yes
A creature, monster, like the Loch Ness
I gets hotter by the tock, before I sizzle to death
I just tell the clock, "Gimme a sec"
In the middle of the war, where my enemy at?
I'm running this bitch, like Eric Bieniemy back
'Cause every time I hit a track I'm like an energy pack
The instruments are crying out "Where the sympathy at?"
Yeah, if you betting money, baby, him'll be back
Whatever legends look like, bitch, I'm finna be that
I walked right in hip hop, like "Where my dinner be at?"
I ate that, and I was like "Where my dinner be at?"
I hate that women lie, so I lie to them back
Got two bitches in my pants, quiet, neither them that
A lot of bitches want dick, I give a lot of them that
Let's do a pill, I can fuck you for an hour with that
And to the kids – Drugs kill, I'm acknowledging that
But when I'm on the drugs, I don't have a problem with that
And my niggas got guns the size of toddlers, biatch
And we aiming right at your fucking collar, biatch
Pow!

[Instrumental Intro]

[Chorus]
Life's a wind parade
Love's a wind parade
Life's a wind parade
Love's a wind parade

[Verse 1]
Lullabys of winds defy the moon
Caught a glimpse of all I never knew
Just holding you can see it
Mother Nature speaking her soul to me
Found out other ways to believe it
It's what she's saying that's a mystery, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna live this life forever
I just wanna live this life forever
I just wanna live this life forever

I just wanna live this life forever
Will you have this mystery forever

Ooh, the wind parade

You know, I take you back
Don't put me through this again

I guess, I don't always deal with shit
The best, caught between my heart and my mind
Depressed, tell me why I smoke more and I
Sleep less, I relieve stress
I don't want to fight that shit above me
Waited up all night for you to call me
Check my phone, it's five in the morning
And you still ain't call

[Chorus]
Back here, fucked up, stuck up in my head now
I can't help but wish that you were here now
Drank too much, I'm drowning in my tears now

[Verse 1]
Say hello to the girl that I am
You're gonna have to see through my perspective
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am
And I don't wanna be so damn protected

[Pre-Chorus]
There must be another way
'Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say what a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers

[Chorus]
What am I to do with my life?
(You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right?
(You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected

[Verse 2]
I'll tell 'em what I like, what I want, and what I don't
But every time I do, I stand corrected
Things that I've been told
I can't believe what I hear about the world
I realize I'm overprotected

[Pre-Chorus]
There must be another way
'Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say what a girl is to do?

What I, what, what, what I'm gonna (I need) do about my destiny

What am I to do with my life?

Now here we come on our thrones, sittin' high
Follow my parade, oh, black parade

[Verse 1]
Into the distance, a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a wind swept field
Standing alone my senses reel
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

[Chorus]
Can’t keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I

[Verse 2]
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty and turned to stone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
A soul in tension that’s learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try

[Chorus]
Can’t keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I

[Verse 3]
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There’s no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss

[Chorus]
Can’t keep my mind from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Us (Us, us, us, us, us) and them (Them, them, them, them)
And after all we're only ordinary men
Me (Me, me, me, me, me) and you (You, you, you, you, you)
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do
"Forward" he cried from the rear
And the front rank died
The general sat and the lines on the map
Moved from side to side

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Black (Black, black, black, black) and blue (Blue, blue, blue, blue)
And who knows which is which and who is who
Up (Up, up, up, up, up) and down (Down, down, down, down)
And in the end it's only round and round, and round
"Haven't you heard it's a battle of words?"
The poster bearer cried
"Listen, son," said the man with the gun
"There's room for you inside"

[Interlude]
I mean, they're not gonna kill ya
So like, if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock
They won't do it again
Dig it? I mean he get off lightly
'Cause I would've given him a thrashing
I only hit him once!
It was only a difference of opinion
But really, I mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 3: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Down (Down, down, down, down) and out (Out, out, out, out)
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about
With (With, with, with, with), without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
Out of the way, it's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For want of the price of tea and a slice
The old man died

[Intro]

[Verse 1: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher, leave them kids alone
Hey! Teacher! Leave them kids alone!

[Chorus: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
All in all, it's just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

[Verse 2: Islington Green School Students]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers, leave them kids alone
Hey! Teacher! Leave us kids alone!

[Chorus: Islington Green School Students]
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro: Roger Waters]
Wrong, do it again! *Children playing*
Wrong, do it again!
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!
(Wrong, do it again!)
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?
(Wrong, do it again!)
You! Yes! You behind the bike sheds! Stand still, laddie!
(If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?)
(You! Yes! You behind the bike sheds! Stand still, laddie!)
*Children playing*
*Phone beeping sound*

[Intro]

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Hello? (Hello, hello, hello)
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on (Come on, come on), now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax (Relax, relax, relax)
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

[Pre-Chorus 1: David Gilmour]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
I have become comfortably numb

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
I have become comfortably numb

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
Okay (Okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up? (Stand up, stand up)
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

[Pre-Chorus 2: David Gilmour]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
I have become comfortably numb

[Guitar Solo 2]

[Intro: DJ Bobbito Garcia]
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract & Merlyn Wood]
Critique signs, critique harsh
Have a barber at my funeral, make sure my niggas cut right
Lineups like they fresh for a flight, my whole life been glamorized
Some dramatized, my sexuality, but baby make it sanitized
Just make the motherfuckers feel it, 'cause it's hammer-sized
Deep in the Atlanta night, we all felt them bama skies
Move my niggas to Montana, only keep a landline
Holler if you feel me, this feel like the night that 'Pac died
Finna hire more niggas that look like us
And when the ones around your city turn against you, who do I trust?
I seen them lined up and loaded, some of the boys even look like us
Man, I love my cup, double up
And I fuck my thugs, that's love (Merlyn!)

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I wanna have it bangin', keep it Southern for ya
I wanna hold it down and keep it comin' for ya right
Tell them motherfuckers they cannot control my life, (life, life, life)
I wanna have it bangin', keep it Southern for ya
I wanna hold it down and keep it comin' for ya right
Tell them motherfuckers they cannot control ya life, (life, life, life)

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Merlyn!
Fishing in Nazareth, tryna catch a bad bitch
Burnin' big bushes but they never burn to ashes
Catch 'em with the bass line, bring 'em to my palace
Like how my mind sharper than a Samurai tick
One hit of this make the sky really different
Ran for forty nights but I sting like Cassius
Inside her thighs, that's aurora borealis
That's my favorite memory, missionary secondary
Sorry, baby, baby, know you lookin' for a hubby
But the blue faces only thing I wasn't trustin'
Yes, Lord, give it to me, yes, Lord, give it to me
God made melody so I could make money, money

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
And I wanna have it bangin', keep it Southern for ya
I wanna hold it down and keep it comin' for ya right
Tell them motherfuckers they cannot control my life, (life, life, life)
I wanna have it bangin', keep it Southern for ya
I wanna hold it down and keep it comin' for ya right
Tell them motherfuckers they cannot control ya life, (life, life, life)

[Intro: KRS-One]
Of course all the hardcore heads
This one goes out to you
Crank up the volume one time
Peace to all the real DJs out there
Cause I don't send my music to no garbage DJs
They get me

[Intro: DJ Bobbito Garcia]
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
God damn, here I am with my anxious heart and not again
I can't fly, you just wanted everything
How could I? I couldn't give you everything

[Verse: Matt Champion]
Fuck this humble shit, I'm 'bout to run it like a track star
No introduction bitch, I'm 'bout to go that hard
Champion, got the goggles after finals
Sprayin' champagne, askin', "Where the fuck the cork goes?"
Mouths like flamethrowers, down South, all blow
Comin' for the throat like that lil' bitch was down on all fours
Moncler on toes, from the dust I rose
Walkin' on the air, guess the gravity's what I oppose
Hatin' ass dog, gettin' back up on your tip toes
I done seen a lot of y'all worked at Kinko's
I been goin' every night, tryna strike gold
We been itching' for that feelin' like a blown nose
In the kitchen, whippin', flippin' 'til the stove blows
Still a student, I am fluent far as prose goes
Five years ago, nothing, not shit
Five years later, five hundred K, just to spit
And I still can't believe that I ain't done talkin' my shit
I know your ass ain't heard of me
I ain't stopping' 'til I die, just occurred to me
Mo' money, mo' problems, fuck the other ninety nine
Just turned twenty-five and I ain't even in my prime

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
God damn, here I am with my anxious heart and not again
I can't fly, you just wanted everything
How could I? I couldn't give you everything
God damn, here I am with my anxious heart and not again
I can't fly, you just wanted everything
How could I? I couldn't give you everything
Yeah

[Outro: Henock Sileshi]
Regardless if you fucking know their name or not
BROCKHAMPTON is a household name, my nigga
Like it or not, it don't matter if you like it
I know that, 

[?]
Every little sugar
Oh, honeysuckle it
Woo, a crazy expression of happiness
Boy, you couldn't be
If a thousand roses
Just wanna 

[?]

[?]
These are in the making

[Intro]
Hey

[Verse 1]
I cried all night, thinking 'bout our story
Broken hearted, that's not happy ends
You changed, I stayed the same
Think we saw this happening
Part of me all of you we both saw this coming

[Pre-Chorus]
Your photograph's been on my wall
Now I'm scratching out your face
I let you down, you let me fall
We're made of glass, we were built to break

[Chorus]
Somebody please tell me what's goin' on
Oh were making a big mistake
We're givin' up for a great escape
We're down this long and lonely road
I don't even know if its right or wrong
But we're going our seperate ways
Through the  hell fire and the flames
We're down this long and lonely road
We're down this long and lonely road
We're down this long and lonely road

[Verse 2]
You're in my mind, I can hear you calling
Echos softly you haunt me through the night
I sank you float up high
Now I watch you in the sky
My memory starts to incinerate so slowly

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope you've grown yourself real tall
Now you've got plenty of space
Dont let me down, my silver star
We always knew we were built to break

[Chorus]
Somebody please tell me what's goin' on
Oh were making a big mistake (hey)
We're givin' up for a great escape (hey)
We're down this long and lonely road
I don't even know if its right or wrong
But we're going our seperate ways (hey)
Through the  hell fire and the flames (hey)
We're down this long and lonely road

[Outro]
Whoa, oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh
It's a long and lonely road
Whoa, oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh
It's a long and lonely road
Down this long and lonely road
Down this long and lonely road
Down this long and lonely road

[Verse 1]
Under your spell
Lock in me in your love like a prison cell
Don't know you well
Got to keep it secret, no kiss and tell

[Pre-Chorus 1]
In my head, in my head
I fight it 'cause I know we're misbehaving, we're danger
Risky 'cause there's something 'bout your lovin'
There's something 'bout your lovin'

[Chorus]
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know I'm yours

[Verse 2]
You call my phone
Fake it, like you're someone I never knew
Our friends, they keep it close
Whispers make our house fall down like dominos

[Pre-Chorus 2]
In my head, in my head
I fight it, but I know this misbehavior it's changin'
And it's special 'cause there's something 'bout your lovin'
But still, I won't say nothin'

[Chorus]
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know I'm yours
I need nobody to know I'm yours

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
See, this is what happens when my back is against the ropes
I come out swinging

My flow, my style, my look
They want my swag so bad, I swear I should write a book
Wake up every morning, check the grass for them snakes
Call these nine millimetre  flows my rate
Bitches over money, no way
I don't fall in love, they just fall in love with me
Maybe it’s the money, the cars or the clothes
They got em back stage at all of my shows

A legacy, yeah I built it from the ground
The crowds in the barrel, their still tryna pull you down
Fuck them ass nigga's
I swear I should write a play, how they smile in my face
That's why I say

I’ll take on all you haters today
Cause I'm not gonna let you get in my way
See, there's one thing that ya'll don't understand
In the end, I'ma be the last man standin'
The last man standin'
The last man standin’
The last man standin’
I'ma be the last man standin’
The last man standin'
The last man standin'
The last man standin'
I’ma be the last man standin'

My chain, my watch, my diamonds
I would give em all up to have a day of silence
Cause dealin' with the paparazzi on the daily
I swear it's enough to drive a rich man crazy

Good weed rolled up, sky high
I just bought a mansion and it's on cloud nine
I love a classy chick straight outta the hood
So I'ma make it rain
Baby, call it flash fuzz

Nigga's puttin' bounty on my head
Sometimes when you so loud they would rather see you dead
Call me Hammer, they can't touch this
My whole life has been ordained
I'm going for the fame, that's why I say
I'll take on all you haters today
Cause I'm not gonna let you get in my way
See, there's one thing that ya'll don't understand
In the end, I'ma be the last man standin'
The last man standin'
The last man standin'
The last man standin'
I'ma be the last man standin'
The last man standin'
The last man standin'
The last man standin'
I'ma be the last man standin'

Lord, take this cross up off of my back, it's heavy
I'm about to hurt somebody, heaven save me
I'm standin' at the cross road, I don't know what to do
My mind is what these haters tryna make me lose

Ever since the money I see these demons in me
And I can't seem to keep nobody real around me
You know how the saying goes
This lonely, the God
I'm allergic to the bottom
And that's why I can't stop

I'll take on all you haters today
Cause I'm not gonna let you get in my way
See, there's one thing that ya'll don't understand
In the end, I'ma be the last man standin'
The last man standin'
The last man standin'
The last man standin'
I'ma be the last man standin'
The last man standin'
The last man standin'
The last man standin'
I'ma be the last man standin'
The last man standin'

[Verse 1]
Remember when you were young
You shone like the Sun

[Refrain]
Shine on, you crazy diamond

[Verse 2]
Now there's a look in your eyes
Like black holes in the sky

[Refrain]
Shine on, you crazy diamond

[Chorus 1]
You were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze
Come on, you target for faraway laughter
Come on, you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine

[Verse 3]
You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the Moon

[Refrain: Roger Waters]
Shine on, you crazy diamond

[Verse 4]
Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light

[Refrain]
Shine on (Shine on), you crazy diamond (You crazy diamond)

[Chorus 2]
Well, you wore out your welcome with random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on, you raver, you seer of visions
Come on, you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine

[Verse 1]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher, leave them kids alone
Hey! Teacher! Leave them kids alone!

[Chorus]
All in all, it's just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

Wrong, do it again! *Children playing*
Wrong, do it again!
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!
(Wrong, do it again!)
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?
(Wrong, do it again!)
You! Yes! You behind the bike sheds! Stand still, laddie!
(If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?)
(You! Yes! You behind the bike sheds! Stand still, laddie!)
*Children playing*
*Phone beeping sound*

[Verse 1]
I have to wonder if this wave's too big to ride
Commit or not commit in such a crazy tide
It's sooner than I thought, but you called me out
I lost control and there's no doubt
I'm gonna start all over

[Chorus]
Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And start all over
Here I come, straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And start all over
I'm gonna start all over

[Verse 2]
Fantastic and romantic, all a big surprise
You got the warning, hesitation pushed aside
It's sooner than I want, but you caught my heart
I guess I'm ready now to start
I'm gonna start all over

[Chorus]
Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And start all over
Here I come, straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And start all over
I'm gonna start all over

[Bridge]
It's so easy, you disrupt me, can't complain
It's so easy, you disrupt me, can't complain
It's so easy, you disrupt me, can't complain
It's so easy (You disrupt me)
I'm gonna start all over (Start all over, start all over)

[Chorus]
Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And start all over
Here I come, straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And start all over

[Chorus]
Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And start all over
Here I come, straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And start all over
I'm gonna start all over

Hello, everybody
I am Miley Cyrus, nice to finally meet you guys!
Thank you guys for coming here tonight
This is my first tour
And having every single one of you guys here tonight
Means everything to me, so feel free to rock out with us
Sing with us, we love you guys, thank you for being here

[Intro]
The weekend's almost done
The moon is low in the sky
I feel like goin' out
Before the night passes by
I won't just sit around
When life becomes a drag
I dance

[Verse 1]
I like the bass
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
I like the boom
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
I need guitar
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
I like that drum when it goes

[Chorus]
Let's dance
What the weekend, what the night is all about
Let's dance
Grab your girlfriends, grab your boyfriends, sweat it out
Let's dance
Move your whole body, and let's start the party
Too much rock for one girl can make her go crazy
I need somebody to dance with me, baby (Dance!)

[Verse 2]
The music's on
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
My favorite song
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
The beat is strong
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
We'll dance
C'mon!
Ow

[Chorus]
Let's dance
What the weekend, what the night is all about
Let's dance
Grab your girlfriends, grab your boyfriends, sweat it out
Let's dance
Move your whole body, and let's start the party
Too much rock for one girl can make her go crazy
I need somebody to dance with me, baby

[Interlude]
Back it up
Yeah!

[Bridge]
When the night says hello
Yeah, get ready to go
Turn it up, turn it loose
Yeah, you got no excuse
Just take a chance
Get out on the floor and dance

[Chorus]
Let's dance
What the weekend, what the night is all about
Let's dance
Grab your girlfriends, grab your boyfriends, sweat it out
Let's dance
And let's start the party
(Dance with me, dance with me)
(Dance with me, dance)

[Chorus]
Let's dance
What the weekend, what the night is all about
Let's dance
Grab your girlfriends, grab your boyfriends, sweat it out
Let's dance
Move your whole body, and let's start the party
As soon as my album goes number one
Mr. Lind, I'd like a Rolex with forty diamonds, ha!

[Intro]
We're gonna take you to high school
’Cause we all go to East Northumberland High
We got you a hall pass, c'mon!

[Verse 1]
My problem isn't that I miss you, ’cause I don't
My problem isn't that I kissed you, whoa
I figured out
That you're nothing that I thought you're about
You're just caught in a place
That soon time will erase in my heart

[Chorus]
You're my type of guy, I guess
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High
For the rest of my life
But people change
Thank God I did
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn’t mean I like you

[Verse 2]
Your problem’s not for lack of trying, 'cause you do
It’s just that you're at your best when you're lying, whoa-ooh
Now you're standing here
And saying things you think I wanted to hear
But you’ve got it all wrong
I've already moved on, my dear
One, two, three, four!

[Chorus]
You're my type of guy, I guess
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High
For the rest of my life
But people change
Thank God I did
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you

[Bridge]
When you're standin' near me
I don't see so clearly
The feelings are still palpable
But when I take two steps away
It sheds some light on my day
Yeah, you can't go back
It's all in the past
Guess you got to laugh at it

[Chorus]
You're my type of guy, I guess
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High
For the rest of my life
But people change
Thank God I did
And if there's some confusion
Let me tell you, you're just delusional
Get a clue
'Cause people change
Thank God I did
Thank God I did
Thank God I did

[Outro]
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you, it doesn't mean I like you!
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Bye-bye, boys!

[Intro]
How many girls do we got out there tonight?
Not you, I see you, you're not a girl
It's girl time! This is a girls night out, everybody
Put your hands together, let's have some fun

[Verse 1]
Don't call me, leave me alone
Not gonna answer my phone
'Cause I don't, no, I won't see you
I'm out to have a good time
To get you off of my mind
'Cause I don't and I won't need you

[Pre-Chorus]
(Hoo, hoo)
Send out a 9-1-1
(Hoo, hoo)
We're gonna have some fun

Won't have to think about you
And who knows what let go will lead to

[Pre-Chorus]
(Hoo, hoo)
You'll hear from everyone
(Hoo, hoo)
You'll get the 4-1-1
(Hoo, hoo)
Hey boy, you knew this day would come

[Chorus]
'Cause it's a girls night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out, without you

[Post-Chorus]
Hoo, hoo
Let's go, G-N-O
(Hoo, hoo)
Let's go, G-N-O
(Hoo, hoo)
Let's go, G-N-O, let's go

[Bridge]
Hey, boy
Don't you wish you could've been a good boy?
Try to find another girl like me, boy
Feel me when I tell you
I'm fine and it's time for me to draw the line
I said, hey, boy
Don't you wish you could've been a good boy?
Try to find another girl like me, boy
Feel me when I tell you
I'm fine and it's time for me to draw the line

[Chorus]
'Cause it's a girls night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out, without you
You better hold tight
This girls night's without you

[Post-Chorus]
(Hoo, hoo)
Let's go, G-N-O
(Hoo, hoo)
Let's go, G-N-O
(Hoo, hoo)
Let's go, G-N-O, let's go
It's a girls night

[Outro]
(Hoo, hoo)
Hoo, hoo
C'mon, girls!

You just wanna stay up
You just wanna lay up
You gon' break it down of course

Kick back

Everytime I hit it, make you feel like it's a kick back
You just wanna stay up

[Intro]
Oh

[Verse 1]
Daylight
I wake up feeling like you won't play right
I used to know, but now that (Oh) don't feel right
It made me put away my pride
So long
You made a (Oh) wait for some, so long
You make it hard for boy like that to go on
I'm wishing I could make this mine, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want it, yeah
You can have it, oh, oh, oh
If you need it, ooh
We can make it, oh
If you want it
You can have it

[Chorus]
But stay woke
They be creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin' (Ooh)
Now stay woke
They be creepin'
Now don't you close your eyes

[Verse 2]
Too late
You wanna make it right, but now it's too late
My peanut butter chocolate cake with Kool-Aid
I'm trying not to waste my time

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want it, oh
You can have it, you can have it
If you need it
You better believe in something
We can make it
If you want it
You can have it, ah!

[Chorus]
But stay woke (Stay woke!)
They be creepin' (They be creepin')
They gon' find you (They gon' find you)
Gon' catch you sleepin' (Gon' catch you sleepin', put your hands up now, baby)
Ooh, now stay woke

Now, don't you close your eyes
But stay woke, ooh
They be creepin' (They gon' find you!)
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin', ooh
Now stay woke
They be creepin'
Now, don't you close your eyes

[Intro]
I know
I know
(Fox!)
I know
I know

[Chorus]
You can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, the heat
It feel like summer
I feel like summer
You can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, the heat
I feel like summer
I feel like summer

[Verse 1]
Seven billion souls that move around the sun
Rolling faster, fast and not a chance to slow down
Slow down
Men who made machines that want what they decide
Parents tryna tell their children please slow down
Slow down

[Refrain]
I know
Oh, I know you know that pain
I'm hopin' that this world will change
But it just seems the same
(It feels like the same)
But it just seems the same

[Chorus]
You can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, the heat
It feel like summer
I feel like summer
You can feel it in the streets
On a day like this, the heat
I feel like summer
I feel like summer

[Verse 2]
Every day gets hotter than the one before
Running out of water, it's about to go down
Go down
Air that kill the bees that we depend upon
Birds were made for singing
Waking up to no sound
No sound

[Refrain]
Oh
I know
I know you know my pain
I'm hopin' that this world will change
But it just seems the same

[Outro]
I know
Oh, I hope we change
I really thought this world could change
But it seems like the same
I know
Oh, my mind is still the same
I'm hoping that this world will change
But it just seems the same
I know
Oh, I hope we change

[Intro]
Yeah, okay

[Verse 1]
Uh, I'm the protector of the network
Invent the architecture, make the world around you better
The artificial intelligence to apply the pressure
The paranoia always keep 'em in line
If you speak the language, then you readin' my mind
The abstract has no reason to rhyme
Uh, no need to define, the rules are here to keep you alive
Oh Lord, I think I'm seein' the signs
So step aside, the evolution, death by execution
Fresh air with less pollution, let the Earth be Earth
They computin' the solutions, tryn' to find out how we do it
It's the fuckin' revolution, let the church be church, yeah
I'm fishin' from the moon, see how my dreams work
Give you what you want, but bet I'm takin' what I need first

[Refrain]
I never said I was an expert, but
You now connected to the network

[Verse 2]
Uh, I'm the protector of the network
Invent the architecture, so it's good for our successors
Live inside of a spaghetti western
I've been thinkin' I could hide in here forever
Yeah, they stimulate us with simulated creations
We built this nation on the basis of a fairy tale
I beg you, can you disconnect me from this fuckin' matrix?
The steak is tasteless and the air is stale
Fallin' for a hummingbird, wonder who discover her
I want to touch her, but the feelin' of it's much too pure, yeah
And the lamb belong to Mother Earth
Forget it for a second, the corrupted gonna turn us into customers
The garden started from the dirt, we need to quench the thirst
You want the answers? Better plan to have adventures first

[Refrain]
Shit, I never claimed to be a expert, but
You now connected to the network

[Verse 3]
Yeah, let me welcome ya to the network
We wage the war and technology surrendered
Remember, please embrace the spirit of your elders
I see myself as but a welder, keepin' it all together
Starin' at confusion
You nothin' but a boy, how do you dare to have delusions?
Shit, my mind's playin' tricks on my vision, see the picture changin'
Switch arrangement, watch the beauty turn to pixelation
There's nothin' pure as the birth of an idea
I know what I fear, I feel it's safe to die here, so
I close my eyes and raise my arms in triumph
If there's answers somewhere, then I got time to find 'em, yeah
I been hidin' inside of my dreams
Was born an angel, they tryin' to buy my wings

[Refrain]
I'm a king, not a expert
But you connected to the network

[Outro]
It's the network
A'ight

[Verse 1]
Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be? You're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me, why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself, "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

[Post-Chorus]
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

[Verse 2]
Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand, then forever can begin

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself, "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

[Bridge]
Oh, whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
That you are not alone, I am here with you
(You are not alone, I am here with you)
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
(Though you're far away, you and me)
But you are not alone, I am here with you
(You are always in my heart)
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone (Not alone, oh)

[Outro]
You are not alone, you are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone, you are not alone
Not alone, not alone
If you just reach out for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me, not alone, oh!
Together, together
Not not being alone!
Not not being alone!
You believe in me!
Not not being alone!
Not not being alone!

[Verse 1]
Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be? You’re not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me, why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself, "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you’re always in my heart
But you are not alone

[Post-Chorus]
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear

[Bridge]
Oh, whisper three words and I'll come runnin’
And girl you know that I’ll be there
I'll be there

[Chorus]
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you’re far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you

That you are not alone, I am here with you
(You are not alone, I am here with you)
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
(Though you’re far away, you and me)
But you are not alone, I am here with you
(You are always in my heart)
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone (Not alone, oh)

[Outro]
You are not alone, you are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone, you are not alone
Not alone, not alone
If you just reach out for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me, not alone, oh!
Together, together
Not not being alone!
Not not being alone!
You believe in me!
Not not being alone!
Not not being alone!
Not not being alone!
Not alone, oh!
Lyrics from Snippet:

[Verse 1]
I've been bad to boys I love
Maybe I'm selfish, maybe I'm young
And my guilty Catholic heart tears my guilty self apart on the floor
But I wish that you did something bad so we could settle the score

[Chorus]
Let me be the victim of your perfect crime
Bathe in my blood so I'm not the bad guy-uy
I messed up so maybe mess up too
Really want the blame to be on you
So, drive the knife in deep
Make the victim me

[Verse 2]
Then I'll hear the yells and see the red and blue
It'll be in the headlines, all our friends will hate you
I know I didn't deserve you, but now, it's vice versa
You'll finally see how it tastes 'cause hurting the one that you swore you'd protect
Is the worst kind of heartbreak

[Chorus]
So, let me be the victim of your perfect crime
I'll kill your conscience like you killed mi-i-ine
Yeah, I messed up so maybe mess up, too
Really want the blame to be on you
So, drive the knife in deep
And make the victim me
Me, ooh

[Verse 1: JOBA]
A broken heart is the

[?]
I can't complain
No one to blame, I am sensitive

Forgive me for my feelings
But when I got that feeling
I'm way too supersticious
Let me know where I went wrong
And maybe we could

Have been all on my own

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Hey, don't waste another minute
Gotta get the bag and then I'm in it

[?] and we finish
No way, no way
Cause no matter how

Imma get all of your

Imma be in love, Imma be in love, someday

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
So I go
I just want you to know
I love my people back home
But I gotta take it slow
Never take it slow

[Intro: Kevin Abstract & Cutty Ranks]
Who feel Cutty? C-C-Cutty run the band
Who feel Cutty? C-C-Cutty run the band
Who feel Cutty? C-C-Cutty run the band
Who-who-who-who feel Cutty? C-C-Cutty run the band
Who feel Cutty? C-C-Cutty run the band
Woo!
A little less vocal for me?
What they sayin' outside?

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Warrior from Corpus, hold the globe in my pocket
My life more predictable than stocks is
We still fighting the same fight that Pac did
Made songs about the neighborhood and then got big
Now I need to give back just like God did
Or more like Hov
Last night when I was stoned I seen an UFO
Thought about how far this shit could actually go
Lord knows all I ever wanted was to be just like my cousin by the stove
Get a rose
I gave you all this music, can I at least get some coze
I told you how I felt and then your mouth froze
Told the world who I was and then my neck froze
Now you acting like I owe, fuck it, you right, I do
Cause them niggas I was around was the foundation for my crew
That's the foundation for my truth
Turning basements into booths
Termination down the sea, baby
That's the reason for the loot

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Go get the lows, pick 'em up and sell it

[?], for- for- forget it
Quest live, so hard develop
Ashes in the sky but the cloud feel like a relic
Missed the light but they show off
After hours we go off
Talking all of that garbage
Go and take it out, give 'em something to choke on
Wack-a-mole but in pig form
I can give a damn bout your 'pinion
Hyped up
I just want a piece of your pension
SUV pack full of my best ones
Smoking out the window look like a damn Jetson
'Bout to go stupid like tonight is the last one
I just need a breeze, to put you at ease
Go 

[?], liquor put me to sleep
Back to Mulholland, 

[?] bands for the view
Convincing myself I'm not useless to you
Shouts from the highest
Listen to they guidance
Running round my head I believe I can hear the choir
Pace around for hours
Wait around for hours
Till everyone in my circle blooming flowers
Flowers, flowers, flowers

[Sample]
Pardon the, uhh, technical difficulties
Pardon the, uhh, technical difficulties

[Verse: Kevin Abstract]
Close my eyes and think about where I was
Before the buzz and the drugs, before the clubs and the doves
Hillbillies running from Texas, we move to the city
South Central was the home, but now my dome feel empty
When them boys tried to press me, made my heart feel itchy
Gang signs so sticky, yeah my boys hit lickies
Man I dare you to tip me
I'm addicted to risky
I'm addicted to corny
Often times it's so boring
Waking up in the morning
See the usual story
I don't wanna keep running from something that still do haunt me
But it's easy to do, it's so easy to lose
It's a challenge to fight
I'm never done getting boo'd
I'm never done hanging on
I'm never done seeing you
No matter how hard I try
It's always a sequel, sequel, sequel

[Verse 1]
Told them your dreams, and they all started laughing
I guess you're out of your mind 'til it actually happens

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?

[Chorus]
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

[Bridge]
Hey, hey
Oh, cover me in daisies
Hey, hey

[Verse 2]
When did we all stop believing in magic?
Why did we put all our hopes in a box in the attic?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the long shot
I'm the Hail Mary
Why can't it be me?

[Chorus]
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out (Count me out)
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

[Outro]
Hey, hey
Oh, cover me in daisies
Hey, hey

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Stuff 'em all in the projects
Niggas taking our profit
Niggas talking for profit
I'm a prophet that's boxed in
A boyfriend that's toxic
I warned him, then stopped it
Took a sip and I hopped in
Fucked all my white friends
And learned from my black ones
Yeah, I'm definitely my dad's son
With the soul of a Jackson
And the cock of a Jordan
They rob my nigga for Jordans
At the park, sparking a jordan
Bleach the BLEACH plaque golden

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Need me a check
Nigga, I need me a check
See how they puttin' my genius in check?
See how they puttin' ideas in my head?
I don't understand, go with the plan
Look at my poems, look at my hands
Look at the sand, Jesus Christ
My life, what is Jesus Christ?
Need me a, need me a, need me a check

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
We was dreamin' of such
Niggas turn G's into funks
What you believe in?
These niggas is demons or somethin'
They made a deal with the devil
Had LA on raisin' the sun
Stick to your truth cause it's all that you got
In this world full of demon and scum
Jesus Christ, don't touch me
Y'all so dusty, I need you to fall back
You scarin' the customers, trust me

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
I'mma- I'mma- I'mma- I'mma keep the bill for a wild one
We don't need no bag, it's been a wild run
How you not see future? Don't know outcome
All I know is I'mma be a rich bitch, bitch (Ah!)
Rich bitch (Huh, bitch, huh, rich)
Rich bitch (Huh, bitch, huh, bitch)
Rich bitch (Huh, bitch, bitch, bitch)
Rich bitch (I'mma be a bitch, fuck it)
Rich bitch! (Bitch, ha!)
Rich bitch (Yeah, I'mma be a bitch, little bitch)
Yeah, rich bitch (Like a bad, huh)
Come on, bitch, fuckin' bitch, yeah (Like a bad bitch)

[Verse 4: Joba]
Vámanos, get it and go
Breaking the mold, look how I flow
Watching them fall like dominoes, showered in gold
What do you know?
Came back with the new digs, always some new shit
Never renewed, bitch, always an old fit, shit
Paid my dues, paid in full, always some new money
The "fuck how you feel" shit, the "fuck what it was" shit
I'm psychic, the "Like Mike" kid posting my shoes still
Too much I can't feel
Walking on water like Jesus, I'm so facetious

[Outro: Joba & Kevin Abstract]

[Vocalizing]
Uh, gotta push to make it feel right, make it feel right
Tried to push to make it feel like, feel, feel, feel
Gotta push to make it feel right, make it feel right
Gotta push to make it feel right, make it feel

Benevolent, invested in humanity and her evolution

‪Turned to a Mothra, this that Godzilla‬
‪Turned to a monster, more like Othello‬

Oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, ayy

[Chorus]
Through the night I creep like mice
Gang, they totin' them sticks, they shoot like Spike
Big Maybach on me, all white like rice
Lil bitch, don't play with me, you not my type
Through the night I creep like mice
Gang, they totin' them sticks, they shoot like Spike
Big Maybach on me, all white like rice
Lil bitch, don't play with me, you not my type

[Verse]
I get it done, I get straight to it
If I say it, I want it, I'ma pursue it
I used to ride 'round in a green Buick
Scammin', finessin', I had to get to it
I wish didn't have to be like that
But it had to be like that
Fuckin' his bitch, she about to get teabagged
Too quick, know I need that, oh
Bitches be killin' me
All like they know me but they do not know me
They might see me up but they still do not know me
I keep it lowkey, make these lil bitches bummy
I really do most, I need me some credit
These bitches be fake, most of these bitches synthetic
I'm fresh off a jet, bitch, I ball like athletics
Glock on my hip, it come off like prosthetics

[Chorus]
Through the night I creep like mice
Gang, they totin' them sticks, they shoot like Spike
Big Maybach on me, all white like rice
Lil bitch, don't play with me, you not my type
Through the night I creep like mice
Gang, they totin' them sticks, they shoot like Spike
Big Maybach on me, all white like rice
Lil bitch, don't play with me, you not my type

[Verse 1]
Is it the way I talk sweet?
The way my skin is soft?
Or how I can be a bitch?
Make you keep your fingers crossed?
Is it the way that I praise you?
The way that I please you?
Or how fast I change my mind
And get scared that I might leave you?

[Chorus]
Could spend your whole life, but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
She’s always been a perfect mystery
Could spend your whole life, but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
And that's what makes a woman to me

[Verse 2]
Is it the way I cut my hair
And put no makeup on?
I feel most beautiful
Doing what the fuck I want
Is it that my intuition
Is never really off?
I need tissues for my issues
And Band-Aids for my heart

[Chorus]
Could spend your whole life, but you couldn’t
Describe what makes a woman
She's always been a perfect mystery
Could spend your whole life, but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
And that's what makes a woman to me

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
That's what makes a woman to me
Oh, oh (Oh yeah, yeah-yeah)
Oh, oh

[Outro]
Is it the way we keep
The whole world turning
In a pair of heels?
Yeah, that's what makes a woman
(There it is, Katheryn)

[Verse 1]
Electric lights
Blow my mind
I feel alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

[Verse 1]
Electric lights
Blow my mind
I feel alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

[Verse 2]
You catch my eye
Bitch, you wanna fly?
I'm so alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school

[Drop]

[Verse 3]
I'm such a star
Queen Boulevard
Blaze through the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

[Bridge]
Get my guitar
Sunglasses on
So light it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school

[Drop]

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

[Verse: Meek Mill]
30 mag the same color as Bernie Mac
For 30 clams I let 'em squeeze then burn your bag
I pull it back then let it scream it go, "Rraaat!"
Then search your bag, you take a breath and then collapse
And it's a wrap, put your face in the dirt
The whole town'll walk around with your face on a shirt
Pussy, and ain't shit pos but death 'cause these youngin's ride for the ride and niggas die for respect
Somebody sign me a check 'cause I'm way too nice
I don't write it I just recite it, you and I connect
I done won and lost fights, hustled all night
Posted on the corner, serving smokers hard white
Niggas alright, but they ain't real enough
My niggas is all nice, that's why niggas feelin' us
Lord, please have mercy on me
Niggas wanna see me laying in that grave, undertaker throwing dirt up on me
Just like the rap, shit ain't working for me
But now my name pop, hatin' ass niggas putting curses on me
Praying I die, I pray to the sky
On my knees, thing on my side, while I pray to my God
Whole squad on tape bro
Spending all they days cold
In that jail cell stressin' why I'm on the same road
Everyday the same clothes, that's why I make the product flip
But I don't really trust a nigga, I done did a lot of shit
But now I'm sick and tired of it
Livin' like I'm livin' on this dough route
I'd rather go out, just like my father did
So I tell niggas suck my dick
'cause you do me the same way that Al Pote did Mitch
So size ya Tony, most niggas is phonies
So keep your eyes wide and watch who you call yo homies

[Chorus]
All the girls like me, and they mans (Ayy, aah)
Unisex (Okay, okay), unisex
I'm for all the ladies and gentlemen
I'm unisex, unisex (Hey, hey)

[Post-Chorus]
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom (Hey)
Boom, boom (Yeah, I like it)

[Verse]
I got juices for him (I got juices), I got jobs for him
Jobs, here's the uniform (Here's the uniform)
You a corn on the cob, I'm a unicorn (I, woo, put it all on the back)
They all bump it in they rides, had to toot my horn (Had to toot, uh)
Had to do a little something I ain't do before (I had to do it, uh)
Had to switch up on the ride, turned the roof to doors (Had to switch up on the)
Make him feel some butterflies when I zoom the Porsche (When I zoom the)
Had to cop a couple bags, needed two of course
Hey, okay, okay
Assume position (Assume it)
You ain't eatin' with us, honey you could do the dishes (Yeah, you could do that, nah)
We don't take no new additions, this a euphemism (Yeah we don't take 'em)
Fuck what they been sayin', y'all don't know what you been missin' (Y'all don't, y'all don't, y'all don't know)
Got the pink all on the pet and lookin' too suspicious (Meow)
You a bum, you a bird, Tweety, you a pigeon (Cuckoo, Tweety, yum)
Here's some crumbs, get the broom, get up out my kitchen (Sweep)
Take a lot to come and see me, you need supervision (You need sweet)
You need supervision (Okay, get it)

[Chorus]
All the girls like me, and they mans

I'm unisex, unisex (Hey)

[Post-Chorus]
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

[Verse]
Don't believe it

No no, no no, no
Don't believe it, don't you
Don't, don't, don't believe it

[Chorus]
Don't believe it, they believe
You da na, da na na, da na, na da

Da na na, you're stuck on one thing
So don't believe it, all the things that you're told
So say I

[Intro]
Yeah
Mmm

[Verse 1]
You set the table, I set a date
They gettin' antsy, I tell 'em, "Wait"
First thing you do is you make the money, baby
Next thing you do is you make mistakes, yeah
They keep on tellin' me, "Take a break"
But I swing for the fences, don't play it safe
Yeah, all that I know is hundred percent
Unplug the connect, then to the check, straight to the bank (Woo)
And this is far from a gimmick
Do not waste my time, not a minute (Not a motherfuckin'—)
They run they mouth like a new kinda fitness
But the room quiet soon as I get in it, bitches

[Chorus]
Get up and climb, I know they
Keep hatin' on mine, but it's okay
Empires fall, I've seen it all
I've seen it all and you can't take it to the grave
You can't take it to the grave
What the fuck you tryna save? If it ain't yourself, then hey
One day, it just goes away
You can't take it to grave with ya, with ya, with ya
You can't take it to grave with ya, with ya, with ya

[Verse 2]
Yeah
They bein' careful, they all afraid
And so insecure, should be ashamed
I got 'em sweatin', you feel the heatwave
Without standin' next to an open flame
Look at the bullshit I overcame
Swear that I'm spoiled and overpaid
Straight to the head, right to the brain
Crazy as heck, take no offense, that's how I'm made, yeah
And all I wanna hear is crickets
Can I mind my motherfuckin' business? (My mo—, motherfuckin'—)
Well, if you gonna hate, then be specific
'Til the day I'm sleepin' with the fishes, I'ma be...

[Chorus]
Me, myself, and I, no, I won't change
I get up, get high like the old days
Empires fall, I've seen it all
I've seen it all and you can't take it to the grave
You can't take it to the grave
What the fuck you tryna save? If it ain't yourself, then hey
One day, it just goes away
You can't take it to grave with ya, with ya, with ya
You can't take it to grave with ya, with ya, with ya

[Intro]
Mmm-hmm

[Chorus]
Yeah, never satisfied, always wish I had more
Yeah, too much on my mind, this ain't what I asked for
Yeah, swear that I was fly when I got a passport
Mmm, see the finish line, but I never fast-forward
Goddamn

[Verse 1]
I came a long, I came a long way
I'm turnin' on the lights and that shit feel like broad day
This about the closest that I've ever come to prayin'
The bullshit gettin' old and I've been runnin' out of patience
I know I'm wrong, that's why the long face
The circle got smaller when the money got made

[Refrain]
This room is gettin' pretty close to vacant
Better listen to the music when it's playin'

[Interlude]
Ayy, woah-woah, woah-woah
Woah-woah, woah-woah
Woah-woah, woah-woah
Woah-woah, woah-woah

[Chorus]
Yeah, never satisfied, always wish I had more
Yeah, too much on my mind, this ain't what I asked for
Yeah, swear that I was fly when I got a passport
Mmm, see the finish line, but I never fast-forward
Goddamn

[Verse 2]
Well, I know it all, I know it all too well
I analyze the world just to distract me from myself
I always been crazy, my mind has been hell
I'm speakin' to my shrink, but I don't even think that helps
I spend this money, I spend this money on you
I could keep it to myself, but I don't wanna be so rude

[Refrain]
This room is gettin' pretty close to vacant
Pretty soon they'll be assumin' that I'm faded, yeah

[Outro]
Daydreams and I don't mind that they far away from me
It's not far away, not far away, it's not far away from me
Come, follow me
Join the legion and see
Everything never is what it seems
Force fed fallacy, I'll show you reality
Come now, follow me
Join the legion and see
Everything never is what it seems
I will set you free
Open yourself up to me

Immortalize, and lift life's disguise
For the first time you'll open your eyes, and realize
Nothing can hide
You can see the world for what it is, a place to die
Ascension of apprehension
Descension to oppression

Darkness rises
Distant voices
Halos burn while angels die
Watch as I gut the sky and bleed it dry
Watch me gut the sky and bleed it dry
Hell and heaven transpose
The gates once opened close to the ghosts I expose
All the lives that hold their throne leave you all alone
Let the fire burn your mortal flesh from bone
Free your soul, flee the world, and behold
Their touch is so cold

Set yourself free and follow me
Feel my pain, disdain, and fade to grey
Lifeless faces circling
Slowly their whispers escalate to screams
The echoes traverse this empty space
Heed their message, succumb to the flames

Cut the cord, disintegrate, and disconnect

Follow the passage of death
Allow me to take your last breath
Now what's next
The purification of flesh

Transcending human form
Absorb into the swarm
I present you something so much more than fictitious human hope
Take that one last step
Take that one last breath
Take that one last step
Take that last breath
Follow me into the gray
Fall with me into the grave

[Leon Thomas III]
... a red bone
I made the room feel like a...

[Post Malone]
What you know about wakin' up?
In the morning you gon' have to leave
All alone in my messy sheets
Ain't no breakfast

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch & Meek Mill]
Bad bitch tip-toein' on the marble floor
Bad bitch tip-toein' on the marble floor
Bad bitch tip-toein' on the marble floor
Got a bad bitch tip toeing on the marble (Hey)
Smack them stars in the Wraith, put 'em all in your face
Hundred bands for the bond when my dawg caught his case
Wipe my hand by my head, to Allah, where we pray
Don't do presi's that's deceased, a graveyard in my safe, hey

[Post-Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I been ballin' every night where these niggas can't see me, swear
Froze my mommas tears and turned 'em into VVSs
'Cause I was stuck inside them trenches like I need a blessin'
Went from public houses to a big a mansion

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Niggas ain't puttin' on things for me when hitters, they came for me
All this shit been plain to see, these niggas wasn't raised with me
Comin' in, I'm in that Cullinan, I feel like that shit was made for me
Phantom gon' get me from A to B, I know my grandmomma prayed for me
I'm goin' in on the front line, these niggas on me, I won mine
They try to leave when it's crunch time, then try to eat when it's lunch time
I kiss my mom on the forehead, had to tell her I love her, it's road time
Graveyards, penitentiaries, only thing that I see with this .45
I got the feds aimin' at me
All these diamonds won't make me happy
Can't even speak to his babymomma
'Cause we gon' know we gon' murder her babydaddy
Lord forgive me

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch & Meek Mill]
Bad bitch tip-toein' on the marble floor
Bad bitch tip-toein' on the marble floor
Bad bitch tip-toein' on the marble floor
Got a bad bitch tip toeing on the marble (Hey)
Smack them stars in the Wraith, put 'em all in your face
Hundred bands for the bond when my dawg caught his case
Wipe my hand by my head, to Allah, where we pray
Don't do presi's that's deceased, a graveyard in my safe, hey

[Post-Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I been ballin' every night where these niggas can't see me, swear
Froze my mommas tears and turned 'em into VVSs
'Cause I was stuck inside them trenches like I need a blessin'
Went from public houses to a big a mansion

[Verse 2: Roddy Ricch]
VVs on my neck, I like my diamonds dancin'
And I been leanin' off this soda, I might crash the foreign
We was robbin' in the night, I had to trap in the mornin'
I just flooded out my wrist, check out the splash warnin'
Before I flooded out my face, I put a mask on it
Gotta keep me a nina on a nigga, 'cause I still got the beef from the streets
I remember them hoes didn't love me, now these bad bitches reachin' for me
Slidin' Rolls in Atlanta, creepin' on peach tree
I just sniped another famous bitch off BET
I gave my dawg a hundred so he can beat a federate case
Amiri grave, yeah, all my pockets got the dead faces
Once I got money, had to cut a lot of dead weight

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch & Meek Mill]
Bad bitch tip-toein' on the marble floor
Bad bitch tip-toein' on the marble floor
Bad bitch tip-toein' on the marble floor

Wipe my hand by my head, to Allah, where we pray
Don't do presi's that's deceased, a graveyard in my safe, hey

I usually don't show my emotions
But it ain't getting better
'Cause you can't be blind with eyes wide open

[Pre-Chorus]
And I see struggle, I see pain
I see only the mess we made
I see things that I can't change
And it hurts my heart to say

[Chorus]
I cry
For the sons without fathers
And the pain that their mothers
Hold deep inside
And I'll fight
For the future we're making
It can change if we face it
'Cause these tears won't dry
So I cry

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh (I cry)
Ooh

When I look in the mirror
Do I see someone that cares for others?

For the ones who stopped dreaming
And the ones who stopped believing
You're not alone
I feel your pain

[Chorus]
I cry
For the sons without fathers
And the pain that their mothers
Hold deep inside, hey
I'll fight
For the future we're making
Only changes if we face it
It's love over pride

[Verse 1]
I like the line between your belly and your thighs
The smell of your hair, the sparkle in your eyes
The smoke in your breath, the breathing hard and heavy
The back of your neck, the shine on your Chevy
The moon was so big when I drove it to the levy, girl

[Chorus]
I found blood and I saw stars
All in the backseat of your car
And I told you it was love
But you won't know the truth
I'm a young man in my prime
And my heart's still filled with fear
And it goes on clear

[Verse 2]
Clean dreams, the sexy limousine
Jason's got the energy, he used to be a coke fiend
The skinny brown arms coming out of your shirt
Heart is in the right place, brain is in the dirt
You live life like everyone's an enemy

[Chorus]
I found blood and I saw stars
All in the backseat of your car
And I told you it was love
But you won't know the truth
I'm a young man in my prime
And my heart's still filled with fear
And it goes on clear

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I found blood and I saw stars
All in the backseat of your car
And I told you it was love
But you won't know the truth
I'm a young man in my prime
And my heart's still filled with fear
And it goes on clear

[Verse 1]
Look in the mirror
Who do I see? Who do I wanna be today?
If you came for a show, which role should I take?
Fading to gray, so do we make a big mistake?
True colors'll show, baby, just put me on display

[Pre-Chorus]
Think I've been here before
I've turned some hearts into stone
And I can't hide it no more

[Chorus]
My love is a mood ring
Up and down emotions, all these mood swings
You know how to read the touch of my skin
Nothing on my body but this mood ring
You change me, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, I want it, and I don't know
I want it, eh-eh-eh
Ooh, I want it, and I don't know

I've turned some hearts into stone

10:35 on a lonely Friday night
She was standin' by the bar, mmm, she was lookin' alright, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I asked if she wanted to dance
And she said all she wanted was a good man
And wanted to know if I thought I was qualified, yeah

[Chorus]
And I said, "Baby, don't waste your time
I know what's on your mind
I may be qualified for a one-night stand
But I could never take the place of your man"

(Tears in her eyes)
He was all she ever had and now she wanted to die
He left her with a baby and another one on the way, yeah
She couldn't stop cryin' 'cause she knew he was gone to stay, yeah

In France a skinny man died of a big disease with a little name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle and soon she did the same
At home there are seventeen-year-old boys and their idea of fun
Is being in a gang called The Disciples, high on crack, totin' a machine gun
Time, time

[Verse 2]
Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church and killed everyone inside
You turn on the telly and every other story is tellin' you somebody died
My sister killed her baby 'cause she couldn't afford to feed it and we're sending people to the moon
In September my cousin tried reefer for the very first time
Now he's doing horse, it's June
Times, times

[Chorus]
It's silly, no?
When a rocket ship explodes
And everybody still wants to fly
Some say a man ain't happy
Unless a man truly dies
Oh, why?
Time, time

[Verse 3]
Baby make a speech, star wars fly
Neighbors just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody see the dawn
Time, times

[Chorus]
Is it silly, no?
When a rocket blows up
And everybody still wants to fly
Some say a man ain't happy, truly
Until a man truly dies
Oh, why?
Oh, why?
Sign of the times

Housequake
There's a brand new groove going 'round
(Housequake)
In your funky town
(Housequake)
And the kick drum is the fault
You got to rock this mother, say
(Housequake)
We got to rock this mother, say
(Housequake)
Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
We're going to show you what to do
You put your foot down on the two
You jump up on the one
Now you're having fun
Huh, you're doing the housequake
Yeah
Question:
Does anybody know about the quake?
(Yeah!)
Bullshit!
You can't get off until you make the house shake
Now everybody clap your hands
Come on
Let's jam y'all
Let's jam
Don't wait for your neighbor
Green eggs and ham

[Chorus]
Doing the housequake
There's a brand new groove going round
In your city, in your town: Housequake
And the kick drum is the fault
Housequake
(Housequake)
Housequake
You got to rock this mother
(You got to rock this mother)
Housequake, housequake
You got to rock this mother down
Come on
Housequake, housequake

[Verse 2]
Now that you got it, let's do the twist
A little bit harder than they did in '66
A little bit faster than they did in '67
Twist little sister and go to heaven
Come on y'all, we got to jam
Before the police come
A groove this funky is on the run
Hey yeah!
Shake your body until your neighbours stare atcha!
Quake, quake, quake, quake, quake, quake

[Chorus]
Housequake
Everybody jump up and down
Housequake
There's a brand new groove going round
(Housequake)
In this city, in this funky town
And the saxophone is the fault
(Housequake)
Check it out
If you can't rock steady
Shut up already, damn, you got to get off!
You know what I'm talking about?

[Intro]
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Oh, sometimes I can't make up my mind
I don't know which yellow brick road to take
Everybody makes suggestions but the words don't rhyme
The decisions they don't have to live by are easy ones to make
Why can't they love me for what I am instead of what they want me to be?

[?]
Two of a fantasy

[Chorus]
Oh, it's a wonderful day, baby
Tonight'll be a wonderful night

[Verse 2]
Ain't nobody's fault but your own
If you don't do what you want
But you got to know
What you want first
Most of our problem, soon as it pass
It gets irrational
Lose all their hunger
All their thirst

[Chorus]
Nevertheless, it's a wonderful day, baby
Tonight'll be a wonderful night

[Interlude]
And if anybody gets in the way
(Sha sha, ooh)
Gets a kiss on the cheek
(Sha sha, ooh, wonderful)
That'll, uh, that'll make it alright
(Wonderful)
Make it, make it, make it alright
Yeah
Yeah, oh, whoo
It's a wonderful day, baby
Tonight'll be a wonderful night
Yeah, bop bop bop bop
Bop bop bop bop
Ow, Uh

[Verse 3]
Darlin', I know what you're like
(What?)
And baby, I know what you're worth
Insecurities never make no money
Animosity kills boys and girls, oh
(Wonderful day, wonderful)

[Chorus]
It's a wonderful day, baby
(Wonderful)
Why can't you see, why can't you see?
(Day)
Oh! It's a wonderful day, baby
(Wonderful day)
Tonight, Tonight'll be a wonderful night, yeah
Wonderful day
Wonderful night
Everybody get up on the one
(Uh uh)
A wonderful day to have fun
(Wonderful day)
Get down
(Uh uh, wonderful night)
(You know it's gonna be alright)
Wonderful day
Nevertheless, it's a wonderful day, baby, Lord
Tonight'll be a wonderful night
Sing it
Hey, it's a wonderful day, baby
Tonight, tonight, I promise it'll be alright

[Outro]
Everybody get up on the one
Papa wanna have some fun
Everybody get down on the three
Party, but you and me
Everybody get up on the one
Tonight we're gonna have some fun
Everybody get down on the three
Party, mama, you and me, uh uh
It's a wonderful day, baby
Party, mama, you and me
Everybody get up on the one

It was only last June when her old man ran away
She couldn't stop crying 'cause she knew he was gone to stay
It was 10:35 on a lonely Friday night
That's when I first saw her, ow, she was lookin' alright

[Pre-Chorus]
I asked if she wanted to dance
And she said all she wanted was a good man
And she wanted to know if I thought I was qualified, yeah

[Chorus]
And I said, "Baby, don't waste your time
I know what's on your mind, yeah
I may be qualified for a one-night stand
But I could never take the place of your man"

[Verse 2]
It hurt me so bad when she told me with tears in her eyes
He was all she ever had and now she wanted to die
He left her with a baby and another one on the way
And she couldn't stop cryin' 'cause she knew he was gone to stay, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
She asked me if we could be friends
And I said, "Oh, honey baby, that's a dead end
You know and I know that we wouldn't be satisfied," yeah

[Chorus]
And I said, "Baby, stop wasting your time
I know what's on your mind
I won't be satisfied with a one-night stand
And I could never take the place of your man"

[Outro]
But I'll try, yeah
I'll sure as hell try
Honey, I'll try, yeah
I'll try, baby
Take the place of your man, yeah
Take the place of your man, yeah

Place of your, place of your, place of your, yeah
Sure as hell try, yeah

[Verse 1]
Teacher, teacher
I'm really not lovin' you
But you're the teacher
I try to do what you want me to
I know you get lonely
But you gotta know
It wasn't love
Let me tell you honey
I'm just a young boy
Don't think I know it enough

[Chorus]
Teacher, teacher
I don't wanna get an A
Teacher, teacher
There's gotta be a better way

[Verse 2]
I'm sick and tired of makin' plans
Without makin' up my mind
(Make up your mind)
Teacher, teacher
Can't you see I just need a little time?
I know you've been cryin'
'Cause you spent the night alone
Well you can cry me a river
Well I don't deliver
We have to do it on the phone

[Chorus]
Teacher, teacher
I don't wanna get an A
Teacher, teacher
There's gotta be a better way

[Break]
(Woohoo, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Teacher, teacher
I'm not really tryin' to get you down
But why should you get used to somebody
Who won't be around?
I know you get discouraged
'Cause you wanna get it all the time
Honey, I can't let you use my body
The same way you use my mind

[Chorus]
Teacher, teacher
I don't wanna get an A
Teacher, teacher
There's gotta be a better way
Teacher, teacher
I don't wanna get an A

[Verse 1]
I guess you know me well, I don't like winter
But I seem to get a kick out of doing you cold
Oh, what the hell, you always surrender
What's this strange relationship that we hold on to?

[Chorus]
Baby, I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that I hate to see you sad
Honey if you left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship? (ship, ship, ship)

[Verse 2]
I came and took your love, I took your body
I took all the self-respect you ever had
I took you for a ride and baby I'm sorry
The more you love me, sugar, the more it makes me mad

[Chorus]
'Cause baby I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that I hate to see you sad
Honey, if you left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship? (ship, ship, ship)

[Refrain]
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

[Verse 3]
Isn't it a shame this ain't a movie
Then you could rewrite my every line
I'll take all the blame, but I'm only human
But I didn't like the way you were, so I had to make you mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that I hate to see you sad
Honey, if you left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship? (ship, ship, ship)

Dorothy was a waitress on the promenade
She worked the night shift
Dishwater blonde, tall and fine
She got a lot of tips

[Verse 2]
Well, earlier I'd been talkin' stuff in a violent room
Fightin' with lover's past
I needed someone with a quicker wit than mine
Dorothy was fast

[Verse 3]
Well, I ordered: "Yeah, let me get a fruit cocktail, I ain't too hungry"
Dorothy laughed
She said: "It sound like a real man to me
(You're kinda cute)
You're kinda cute, you wanna take a bath?"
(Do you wanna, do you wanna?)
... Bath?

[Verse 4]
Oh, I said: "Cool, but I'm leavin' my pants on (What you say?)
'Cause I'm kinda goin' with someone"
She said: "Sound like a real man to me
Mind if I turn on the radio?"
"Oh, my favorite song," she said
And it was Joni singing: "Help me, I think I'm falling"
(Drring) The phone rang and she said
"Whoever's calling can't be as cute as you"
Right then and there I knew I was through
(Dorothy Parker was cool)

Well

[Verse 5]
My pants were wet, they came off
But she didn't see the movie 'cause she hadn't read the book first
Instead she pretended she was blind
An affliction brought on by a witch's curse
Dorothy made me laugh
(Ha ha, ha ha)
I felt much better so I went back to the violent room
(Tell us what you did, what you did)
Let me tell you what I did

[Chorus]
I took another bubble bath
With my pants on
All the fighting stopped
Next time I'll do it sooner
This is the ballad of Dorothy Parker
Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker
Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker

[Outro]
Well
Dorothy Parker, Dorothy Parker
Well
Oh

Late at night, when the world is sleeping
You are frightened, 'cause the power's creeping
In your room is something you're afraid of
Life or doom is what this feeling's made of

Power fantastic
Is in your life at last and
You're a little apprehensive
'Cause what it is, is what you want and need, oh

You’re a little apprehensive
Is what it is, is what you want and need

[Verse 1]
That kind of girl's no good for you
She flips her hair and thinks she's cool
Giggles at every joke you tell
Ask her religion, she'll say "swell"
Starving children, now that's hot
Long as she's eating, damn the lot
The Queen of England, Duke of Earl
They ain't got nothin' on this girl

[Chorus]
She change sheets with a different key, not as bad
Guinness couldn't count all the men she's had
You won't be satisfied 'til you marry the hag
Give birth to an eggplant, oh what a drag

[Verse 2]
That kind of girl's no good for you
All she wants to do is you
There's always eight women to three men
But if you marry an eggplant, oh what then?

[Chorus]
She change sheets with a different key, not as bad
Guinness couldn't count all the men she's had
You won't be satisfied 'til you marry the hag
Give birth to an eggplant, oh what a double drag

Doo doo doo doo
Marry an eggplant, oh what then

Everybody want what they don't got
People alway want what they should not
If they got nothin' or if they got a lot
Everybody want what they don't got, oh

[Verse 1]
Sweet Sarah Succotash saw a silver scarf
Can you guess what sweet Sarah Succotash wants?
She used her last penny to buy a Jack Benny album
For the stupid jokes nobody got, oh

[Chorus]
Ooh, I really like what my neighbor's drivin'
No, I don't care how long he been strivin'
I guess I just want it 'cause people think it's hot
Everybody want what they don't got, oh

[Verse 2]
Don't be deceived by your greedy heart
It could be the devil in disguise
Check the ingredients before you start
One day they all could change in front of your eyes

[Chorus]
Everybody want what they don't got
People always want what they should not
If they got nothin' or if they got a lot
Everybody want what they don't got, oh

Can I - can I rap to you?
Come on
Ah-ah-ah!

[Verse 3]
Blanche, throw away your pride
Blanche, you know you ain't been driven until you try my ride

[Verse 1]
To an orgy in a garden of flowers
Adonis and Bathsheba flew
All of creation awaits them
Flowing, they'll stand by the crystal blue
Stream of desire and erotic rebellion
That parades through their hearts and minds
They look at one another as much as they don't
To touch is their need
To love, they are blind
To love, they are blind

[Verse 2]
An abandoned gazebo house
Is what looks to be a perfect place
They undress as they're running, Bathsheba crying
Adonis' sweat upon his face
For them, there is no morning
Only night decisions so grand
There is no bed, how will they ever love?
They decide to stand
No bed, they decide to stand

[Outro]
Adonis and Bathsheba in a garden of flowers
In a garden of love

[Intro]
La da da da da da da da

[Verse 1]
There comes a time in every man's life
When he gets tired of fooling around
Juggling hearts in a three-ring circus
Someday drive a body down to the ground
I never imagined that love would rain on me
And make me wanna settle down

[Pre-Chorus]
But baby, it's true, I think I do
And I just want to tell you that I wanna with you
Baby, if you do too

[Chorus]
Oh, forever, forever
Baby, I want you forever
I wanna keep you the rest of my life
All that's wrong in my world, you can make right
You are my savior, you are my light
Forever I want you in my life

[Refrain]
La da da da da da da da
La da da da da da

[Verse 2]
There comes a road in every man's journey
A road that he's afraid to walk on his own
I'm here to tell you that I'm at that road
And I'd rather walk it with you, than walk it alone
You are my hero, you are my future
When I'm with you, I have no past
Baby, my one and only desire
Is find some way in this doggone world
To make this feeling last

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause, sugar, it's true, huh, I know I do
Baby, I just wanna tell you I wanna with you

[Chorus]
And I'm forever, forever
Baby, I want you forever
I wanna keep you for the rest of my life
Whatever's wrong in my world, you can make right
You are my savior, you are my light
Forever I want you in my life

My Baby let me touch her on Thursday night
Her scent stayed with me until Friday noon
I couldn’t wash my body for fear of losing
The budding heart of my sweet baby’s perfume

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't saying you're better, baby
I ain't saying you're not
I ain't saying anything until I've got
Our bodies entwined, that's when you'll be mine
For always and for all time

[Chorus]
Crucial: baby, our love has got to be
Crucial: everything from A to Z
Crucial: you've got to show me everything, everything, everything

[Verse 2]
Is that Old Man River knocking at your door
Saying that we got to let more than our feelings show?
Baby, tonight don't hold nothing back, I know you've got some more
I will give you mine if you give me yours

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything that you learned in school
Baby, I need to know
Everything that your Mama taught you
Ooh, you got to tell me so
Baby, I won't stop
Until you let me cop
Your body is a river
And I want every drop

[Chorus]
Crucial: baby, our love has got to be
Crucial: every little thing from A to Z
Crucial: you have got to show me everything, everything, everything

[Verse 1]
What a day, what a day

Oh, what a day, what a day
When the dawn of the morning comes
Oh, what a day (What a day)
There'll be love for everyone

We will dream in color
While we look into the sun (Into the sun)
Unafraid, only blind faith (Every brother)
Blind faith in the one (Every sister stand)
There will be no more pain
No more shame
A never-ending glory
To his reign

Oh, what a day (What a day)

All eyes is a-lookin'
To view the new rising sun

[Intro]
This is the story of two childhood sweethearts, inseparable 'til one broke the other one's heart
She wants to leave him but I would die first
Baby, don't leave me, I didn't mean to hurt you
By heaven I swear

[Chorus]
I am a witness for the prosecution of a hate in this love affair
I who am guilty of nothing but always wantin' you to be there

[Verse 1]
Mama, I swear I love you, I always have
In school I once traded chairs
I couldn't feel you, if I couldn't be near you
I wanted what was yours
Now I just want you to care

[Chorus]
I am a witness
Witness for the prosecution
Witness for the prosecution
I am a witness
Witness for the prosecution

Give me twenty years, gimme the electric chair
But nothing's gonna stop me, nothing's gonna stop me
From killin' the hate in this love affair

Witness for the prosecution
For the prosecution of a hate in this love affair

Gimme death row, gimme solitaire
But don't you leave me, baby, leave me, baby

Now I just want you to care
Witness for the prosecution
Tell me, baby, tell me do you care?
Witness for the prosecution
Ooh

[Outro]
Nothing's gonna stop me from burnin' the hate in this love affair
Love affair
They can give me twenty-one years, no, make that twenty-two
As soon as I'm free, I will run to you
I am a witness for the prosecution of a hate in this love affair

For those of you on the way out
You might not have a place to go
But that ain't what it's all about
That someone that loves you
And keeps your life together
Could one day disown you
Throw you out so you can watch the weather

But it be's like that sometime, sometime
Be like that sometime, y'all
Ooh...

If you were tryin' to lift up the groove
They would follow you around
But maybe you would rather

For those of you on your way down
It be's like that sometime, sometime
Be's like that, y'all, sometime
Be's like that sometime, sometime

Break you when you had enough

'Cause on your way down you can knock knock
'Cause you did it your way

You tell 'em it be's like that sometime, y'all
Be like that sometime
Yeah...

[Verse 1]
Last night I was lonely not for anyone
Not just for anyone
Last night I wanted you

Stars outside my window counting just for fun
Counting just for fun
I counted 2,002
Ooh

[Chorus]
Emotional pump, you are my
Concentrate on you is all I have to do
To make my body jump, emotional pump
Like the falling rain my body cries
For you are my emotional pump

[Verse 3]
I want you not just sexually
Not just sexually
But in a way like a mother wants a child

[Spoken Interlude]
I notice the rain more than I used to
More than I used to
When I had you always, always
Always know you're gone
Now I'm so blue
Bluer than I use to
Bluer than I use to be

[Chorus]
Oh, emotional pump, you are my
Concentrate on you is all I have to do

For you are my emotional pump

[Verse 1]
This is a cosmic dream
I look outside my window
I see blue and whipped cream
There goes a merman, uh-oh
Swimming up in the sky
How did he get there?
Oh my

[Chorus]
There's nothing strange, I'm not deranged
I only want every day to be or to be a cosmic day

[Refrain]
Hey, hey
Tra la la la, tra la la la, tra la la la la la

[Verse 2]
Walking alone in the dark
(Alone)
I see nothing you see
(I see it could be)
I could be in a park
(In a park)
Or flying in the, in the deep sea
I wish you'd hold my hand
Then everything it could be

[Chorus]
There's nothing strange, we're not deranged
We only want every day to be or to be a cosmic day

[Refrain]
Hey, hey
Tra la la la, tra la la la, tra la la la la la

[Verse 3]
Driving in a fast car
Looking for love in the breeze
Every sky in the star
Another hug if you please
Everything's grand
If you understand
Love is a thought away
As sure as there is me
Every day could be a cosmic day

[Refrain]
Hey, hey
Tra la la la, tra la la la, tra la la la la la

Woke up this morning
(Yeah)
Looked all around
(All around)
Couldn't find my baby
She was no where to be found

In the middle of the night
Took her up to heaven
But people, that's alright

Oh my la-di-da-da
Wally, where'd you get those glasses?
Those are the freakiest glasses I've ever seen
Can I try 'em on?
You see, I'm goin' to a party tonight and I could be so clean
Are you goin' with that same dame?
You know, the one with the beautiful chest and the gorgeous mouth
'Cause if you are, I was wonderin' if she had a sister
'Cause Wally, that dame is so fine
Eeh-hee!

Check it out Wally, huh (growl), I'm on the prowl tonight
'Cause my baby don't love me no more
She said, she said, "Well maybe I do, just not like I did before"

Ain't that a trip, Wally?
You know, I'd give her all my money 'fore I'd give it all to Uncle Sam
Can you believe it, Wally?
Where'd you get those glasses?
Those are the freakiest glasses I've ever seen
Ooh
Wally, can you tell me why did my baby leave?
La-la-la-di-da, oh my la-di-da
Wally, come on, go out with me tonight
We'll tear it up like we used to do
You wanna bring your lady, it's alright
But if you'd rather stay at home tonight, it's cool
Oh no, I understand
We'll b able to hook up sometime when I find another
Then the four of us, I mean the four of us can
Ooh
Oh my la-di-da

It's too late for sympathy
Whatever will be will be
I'm goin' to a party
And if I don't find somebody, somebody will find me
Huh, what am I gonna do?
She was the only one in the whole world that I could talk to

Wally, where'd you get those glasses?
Those are the freakiest glasses I've ever seen
Ooh
La-la-la-di-da, oh my la-di-da
Ooh

[Intro]
Whoa-oh-oooh
Whoa-oh-oooh

[Verse 1]
People say you got big money, tell me, is it true?
They tell me that they'll wait in line, just to get a date with you
'Bout how you gave a hundred dollars to a skid-row bum
Well let me tell you something, baby, if you think I'm dumb

[Pre-Chorus]
If money's all you got, I don't want it
If you can't me hot, I don't need you 'round
If you can't turn me on, I don't need it
I need a lover that's strong, I don't got time to fool around

[Chorus]
I need a man
I need a real man
I need a man
I need a M-A-N, real man

[Verse 2]
They say you got a fancy car, a real Mercedes-Benz
They tell me that Springsteen is one of your best friends
Money don't make no man, sucker, get up off that funk
Let me tell you one more time in case you think I'm drunk

[Pre-Chorus]
If money's all you got, I don't want it, oh
If you can't me hot, I don't need you 'round
If you can't turn me on, I don't need it, no
I need a lover that is strong, I ain't got time to fool around

[Chorus]
I need a man
I need a real man
Think I don't?
I need a man
I need a M-A-N, real man, whew, yeah

[Ad lib]
Give it to me
Give it
Is it alright if I play this thing?
Get out my way now

[Refrain]
The only way to get me hot
I need a lover with a lot
A little money don't hurt
But I'd rather have a body that works

[Pre-Chorus]
If money's all you got, I don't want it, mmm
If you can't me hot, I don't need you around
If you can't turn me on, I don't need it, no
I need a lover that is strong, ain't got time to fool around

[Chorus]
I need a man, oh
I need a real man
Think I don't?
I need a man, yeah
I need a M-A-N, real man
I need a M-A-N, real man
Say it again
M-A-N, real man
One more time
M-A-N

[Refrain]
The only way to get me hot
I need a lover with a lot
A little money don't hurt
But I'd rather have a body that works

[Outro]
Work

Hold on
Give it to me!
Ow!

Skip the change, keep grooving
Ow

Need a man, yeah
M-A-N, real man
Ow, give it to me

[Intro]
Well, hello
It's about time you got home
No baby, don't try that tail waggin' routine on me
I want to know where you been
Now speak
That's right, get to talkin'
Or get to walkin'
Yeah, woo
Am I supposed to believe that?
Huh

[Verse 1]
Lipstick on your shirt, baby
And perfume in your bed
You bet on a new love, baby
And lost my love instead
If I take you back, you got to promise

[Chorus]
Promise to be true
(Yeah)
Promise to always be true
(You got to promise)
Promise to be true
(Oh yeah)
Promise to always be true

[Verse 2]
Phone numbers in your suit jacket
Too many nights with the boys
'Cause you're exactly like a spoiled little baby on Christmas
You wanted too many toys
Oh baby, so wrong but will you promise?

[Chorus]
Promise to be true
(Oh, oh)
Promise to always be true
(You got to promise)
Promise to be true
Promise to always be true
(Listen to me now)

[Breakdown]
Woo, woo
Promise to be true
Oh
Do do do do
Say it, say it, say it!
C'mon, say it
Promise this time to be true
C'mon, say it
Oh yeah, I'd be lost without your kiss
But if you mess up again
Honey, you ain't gon' have no lips to kiss with
Oh

[Verse 3]
I got plenty plenty lovin' for you, baby
But you got to rearrange
(Got to rearrange)
I can find it in my heart to forgive you, baby
Baby, can you really change?
(Yes I will)

[Chorus]
But you got to promise to be true
(You got to promise)
Promise to always be true
(Promise to be true)
Promise to be true
Promise to always be true

[Verse 4]
You know you got all my money
(You got my money, money)
I'll give it to you every time
(Woo, every time)
If you can't support me one more time again
(One more time)
You are still like that child on Christmas

[Chorus]
Promise to be true
Promise to always be true
(Promise to be true)
Promise to be true
Promise to always be true
(Promise to be)
(Do it)
Promise to be true
(You got to promise to be true)
Promise to always be true

Promise to always be true
(Yeah)

[Outro]
Baby, if I take you back
Baby, if I take you back, you got to promise
From the bottom of your stinky ol', crusty ol' no-good heart
You got to promise
To be true, true, true
We've been together, baby, so, so long
Honey, I'm your biggest fan
Other women want you, but they're so, so wrong
I'll never let 'em take my man

You took my girlfriend out on a date
I didn't like it so I cut up her face
Hey, hey, what can I say?
I'm just a jealous girl
Hey, hey
Jealous girl

I had a fight with Judy Saturday night
She said you had the cutest guy in town
I had to ask the girl if she was losin' her sight
'Cause can't nobody put you down

She understood when she went to your house
That's okay 'cause I blew up her car (Blew up, blew it up)
Hey, hey, what can I say?
I'm just a jealous girl
Jealous girl
I'll never let you go
Jealous girl
Baby, I love you so
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

Jealous girl
Woah-woah-woah-woah

Hey hey, what can I say?
I'm just a jealous girl
Hey hey, what can I say?
I'm just a jealous girl
Woah, hey, hey, what can I say? Jealous

Girl, you better find you somebody else
Don't you know I'll cut you?
Think... think I won't?

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I'd like to know why you do me so bad
I gave you all the love that I had
You do me like my enemies do
There's something I like about being your fool

[Verse 2]
I can't explain, my brain's all hazy blue
I'm feelin' pain, I'm feelin' pleasure too
When you tie me up it's hard to get me loose
'Cause there's something I like about being your fool

[Verse 3]
Time after time you spend all my money
Honey, I don't mind when you wreck my car
You mess around all over town
But, honey, we're still cool
'Cause there's something I like about being your fool
(One more time)
You mess around all over town
But, honey, we're still cool
'Cause there's something I like about being your fool

[Intro]
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
Look at us
Two children in a grownup world
Playing around with love and sex
Look at you
Out of control
So in love with a crazy girl
Claiming that I have you under some kind of hex
Look at me
Trying my best to seduce you when I know you're already mine
Surely, surely in a grownup world
You and I, in a grownup world, you and I
Could find better use of our time
Of our time

[Chorus]
Love and sex
An emotional merry-go-round
It’s like riding on a Ferris Wheel upside down
Every time I see you my heart just pounds
And my legs go weak
It's hard to speak
All I can say is I'm under your hex
All I wanna do is you
Love and sex

[Verse 2]
Check me out
A little bit forward but you know I be speaking my mind
You’re the only thing I wanna do with my time
Girls should be girls
But in a grownup world
Who wants to be nonchalant
In other words, baby, I know what I want

[Chorus]
Love and sex
An emotional merry-go-round
It's like riding on a Ferris Wheel upside down
Every time I see you my heart just pounds
And my legs go weak
It's so hard to speak
All I can say is I'm under your hex
All I wanna do is you
Love and sex

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby, baby you know what I want
Love and sex
An emotional merry-go-round
It's like riding on a Ferris Wheel upside down
Every time I see you my heart just pounds
And my legs go weak
It's so hard to speak
(All I can say)
All I can say is I'm under your hex
All I wanna do is you
Love and sex
An emotional merry-go-round
It's like riding on a Ferris Wheel upside down
Every time I see you my heart just pounds
And my legs go weak
(I said my legs go weak)
It’s hard to speak
All I can say is I’m under your hex
Love and sex
Sex
Sex
Sex
Sex
Sex
Sex

[Chorus]
Expert lover, my baby
You ever had a Crystal Ball?
Expert lover, my baby
You ever had a Crystal Ball?
Ooh, expert lover, my baby
Ever had a Crystal Ball?
Expert lover, my baby
You ever had a Crystal Ball?

[Verse 1]
As bombs explode around us and hate advances on the right
The only thing that matters, baby, is the love that we make tonight
As little babies in make-up terrorize the western world
The only thing that matters, baby, is love between a boy and girl

[Chorus]
Oh, expert lover, my baby
You ever had a Crystal Ball?
Undercover, no maybe
All for fun and fun for all

[Verse 2]
I can't remember my baby's voice
Because she ain't talking no more
Only the sound of love and prayer echo from the yellow floor
Yellow floor
Huh, she's saying:
"Dear Jesus, save us from temptation
Dear Jesus, save us from hell
Save us from the madness that threatens us all
Can you hear us? It's hard to tell
In your name we pray"

[Chorus]
Expert lover, my baby
You ever had a Crystal Ball?
Undercover, no maybe
All for fun and fun for all

[Verse 3]
As soldiers draw swords of sorrow
My baby draws pictures of sex
(Yes, she does)
All over the walls in graphic detail: sex!

[Chorus]
Everybody say it now
Expert lover, huh, my baby
Ever had a Crystal Ball?
Under, undercover, ha, no maybe
All for fun and fun for all

[Verse 1]
She wants a place in heaven
But she cannot face the truth
She lives on a rope of self-pity
It only requires a noose

[Chorus]
Why are the ones so afraid to live
Much more afraid to die?
It's as easy to imagine laughing
When you really hear a cry
And they sound the same
Hell, they sound the same

[Verse 2]
You want a place in heaven
Maybe you're already there
Life's what you make it, stop whining baby
Love comes to those who care

[Verse 3]
There must be children in heaven
Ones who know nothing from hate
Three year-old leaders of all colors
I'd feel safer with them in control, control, control, control
Three year-olds in control

[Verse 4]
We all want a place in heaven
Suites of that level are few
Let's not be lazy, there's no room service
It's all up to me and you
Let's not be lazy, there's no room service
It's all up to me and you

[Intro]
Oh, oh

Oh, sometimes I can't make up my mind
I don't know which yellow brick road to take
Everybody makes suggestions but the words don't rhyme
The decisions they don't have to live by are easy ones to make
Why can't they love me for what I am instead of what they want me to be?

[Chorus]
Oh, it's a wonderful day, baby
Tonight'll be a wonderful night

It’s nobody's fault but your own
If you don't do what you want
I ain’t claimin’ no group solution
That’ll work for everyone
Just a simple pop psychology that sings

[Chorus]
Oh, it's a wonderful day, baby
Tonight'll be a wonderful night
And if anybody gets in the way
(Sha sha, ooh)
Gets a kiss on the cheek
(Sha sha, ooh, wonderful)
That'll, uh, that'll make it alright
(Wonderful)
Make it, make it, make it alright
Yeah
Yeah, oh, whoo
It's a wonderful day, baby
Tonight'll be a wonderful night
Yeah, bop bop bop bop
Bop bop bop bop
Ow, Uh

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Oh, it's a wonderful day, baby
Tonight'll be a wonderful night

It’s nobody's fault but your own
If you don't do what you want
But you got to know
What you want first
Most of our problem, soon as it pass
It gets irrational
Lose all their hunger
All their thirst

[Chorus]
Nevertheless, it's a wonderful day, baby
Tonight'll, huh,  be a wonderful night

And if anybody gets in the way
(Sha sha, ooh)
Gets a kiss on the cheek
(Sha sha, ooh, wonderful)
That'll, uh, that'll make it alright
(Wonderful)
Make it, make it, make it alright
Yeah
Yeah, oh, whoo
It's a wonderful day, baby
Tonight'll be a wonderful night, yeah
Ow, Uh

Darlin', I know what you're like
(What?)
And baby, I know it's your world
Insecurities never make no money
Animosity kills boys and girls, oh
(Wonderful day, wonderful)
It's a wonderful day, baby
(Wonderful)
Why can't you see, why can't you see?

[Interlude]

Sometimes I can't make up my mind
I don't know which yellow brick road to take
Everybody makes suggestions but the words don't rhyme
The decisions they don't have to live by are easy ones to make
Why can't they love me for what I am instead of what they want me to be?
A true love, together mind
Too open to fantasies

[Chorus]

I guess you know me well, I don't like winter
I seem to get a kick out of doing you cold
Oh, what the hell, you always surrender
What's this strange relationship that we hold on to?

[Chorus]
Baby, I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that I hate to see you sad
Honey, if you left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship? (ship, ship, ship)

[Verse 2]
I came and took your love, I took your body
I took all the self-respect you ever had
I took you for a ride and, baby, I'm sorry
The more you love me, sugar, the more it makes me mad

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that I hate to see you sad
Honey if you left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship? (ship, ship, ship)

Isn't it a shame this ain't a movie
Then you could rewrite my every line
I'll take all the blame, yo baby, I'm sorry
But I didn't like the way you were, so I had to make you mine

[Chorus]
Baby I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that I hate to see you sad
Honey if you left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship? (ship, ship, ship)

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Uh, all I want is head
Gained $30,000 worth of diamonds, like a gumball
Playin' with my money, that's gon' turn a nigga awol
Could've shot with Paul 

[?], rather shot with Nick though
All my dogs fightin' like a mother fuckin' pit, though
Fight 'em like I'm

Puttin' in work with the chop, it's gon' kick back
Tech gon' kick
Like a bitch, I need a tic tac

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
Niggas want the fame but all these niggas do is kick back
Bitch saw the gang and she damn near had a heart attack
Thirty racks racked up in a nigga backpack
I just snatched a groovie white bitch from the shake shack
Dunkin' in that pussy, like Shaq attack
(You niggas really don't get no money)
Bitch, hey

[Verse 4: Byou]
I'm gone off that act
He who do not act, I don't remember no script
I juuged up prescriptions
Higher than ghost and he gon' build a stump
Boy, we don't smoke weed
We probably steal from police
'Cause they be stashin' more drugs than me
Then turn around and ask for

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
They say runnin' with the sack make you the main target
Runnin' with the sack make you the main target, ayy

Runnin' with the sack make you the main target
Runnin' with the sack make you the main target
Well call me bullseye, keep a third eye (Yeah)
Crippin' so damn slow, you would've thought it was drive by

[Verse 5: Lil Yachty]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Gang break in two
Breakin' a bitch back, though
I'm smackin' on her pussy like the cartoons with cereal
Niggas get real serious when I run through they cereal
Numbers addin' up, like a... (Numbers addin' up, like a 

[?] )
You gon' go broke tryna impress the inferrer
A wise man once told me not to be into her, but still into her
Licked on that pussy one time, never again, it taste like vinegar
Dabble water on these fuckin' rap niggas, they be callin' me the fuckin' sinister
Could've been the fuckin' minister
Swag so just a mystery
Used to tease them, philosophy
'Til 

[?] but can't contest to me

[?]
Never been a dope boy, but I'm dope, boy
Only nigga that can jump headfirst in the ocean and still float, boy

I saw you sitting in the center of the circle
Everybody, everybody wanted something from you
I saw you sitting

I saw you swaying to the rhythm of the music
Saw you playing, caught you praying to the voice inside you
I saw you swaying

I don't care what you used to be
I go back so far, I'm in front of me
I don't mind no cloudy day
As long as the people go, "Hey, hey, hey"

I can see the future
I can see the world tonight
Love will make me happy
It will keep me shining bright

Saw you sitting in the center of the circle
Everybody, everybody wanted something from you
Yeah, I saw you sitting

[Verse 1]
Told them your dreams, and they all started laughing
I guess you're out of your mind 'til it actually happens

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?

[Chorus]
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

[Verse 2]
When did we all stop believing in magic?
Why did we put all our hopes in a box in the attic?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm the long shot
I'm the Hail Mary
Why can't it be me?

[Chorus]
They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down (Knock me down)
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

[Bridge]
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
(I wanna see your peacock-cock-cock, your peacock)
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air)
(Air) Tonight (Tonight) I'm walking on air (I'm walking)
I'm walking, I'm walking on air (Air)
Tonight (Tonight) I'm walking on air (I'm walking on air)
Another one in the basket (Air)

Tonight (Tonight) I'm walking on air

Let's go!
They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the ----?

[Chorus]
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out (Count me out)
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

[Verse 1]
Looking out, across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out, into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

[Chorus]
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)

Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?

Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?

Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?

[Bridge]
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
Why? Oh, why?
Why? Oh, why?

[Verse 3]
Looking out, across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

I've been lonely since I woke up
I wanna touch
No it's never enough
I heard his voice then had a cry
Made me remember all the reasons why

I wanna give you all I've got
Until I'm not even a thought
You've been hanging out in my head
I've been imagining you in my bed

But my imagination can only go
Only go so far
Only go so far
I want the real thing
I want it bad
Want you to hold me like you never have

Can our bodies meet again
Like it's the first time
Like there's no time

[vocalising]

I wanna give you all I've got
Until my body begins to rot
You've been hanging out in my head
I've been imagining you in my bed

But my imagination can only go
Only go so far
Only go so far
I want the real thing
I want it bad
Want you to hold me like you never have

Can our bodies meet again
Like it's the first time
Like there's no time

[Intro]
Yeah, Doja
Oh, oh, oh
Mmm, careful
¿What?
Uh, ok
Yeah
Uh, ok
(Haha)

[Verse]
I had a conversation, with a constellation (What?)
Told me that my aspirations are the path to greatness (Huh)
Shawty bad, her booty badder than the wrath of Satan (Wow)
No more classes, Yay, but Doja needs emancipation
That's a ration
Wonder why a nigga smashed faced
Exaggerated, now I never got a chance to say it
But I've been waiting all my life to be the voice of you
Elaborating on all the shit ya'll been through
Cause I was there, but I know other people had it worse
Different style, different smile, different way of words
See you cannot frame a picture that ain't painted first
So point your finger to the sky, don't ever aim at Earth

[Pre-Chorus]
Like pow, to my destination, one round, no validation, going wild
Now i'm in my spaceship, speed of light but it takes some patience
Like pow, to my destination, one round, no validation, going wild
Now i'm in my spaceship, speed of light but it takes some patience
Like pow, to my destination, one round, no validation, going wild
Now i'm in my spaceship, speed of light but it takes some patience
Like pow, to my destination, one round, no validation, going wild
Now i'm in my spaceship, speed of light but it takes some patience

[Chorus]
Blazer, blazer, blazer, blazer

[Verse 1]

[?], til we get the message
I feel the pressure
Under more scrutiny
And what I do?
Act more stupidly
Pop more jewelry, hoard Louis V
My momma couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosby's
I ain't go to hell man
I guess the money should've changed em
I finally came back to where I came from

[Chorus]
Ahhh la la la la
Our Lord and savior, Jesus Christ
Accept and receive eternal life
Aaahhh
They can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, they can't tell me nothing
They can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, they can't tell me nothing
Ahhh la la la la
Our Lord and savior, Jesus Christ
Accept and receive eternal life
Aaahhh
They can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, they can't tell me nothing
They can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, they can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2]
See the devil will make you think
If you follow God
You finna fall off
We put these tickets on sale in the morning
And they sold out in the morning
Nah I'm saying I be in the studio
And people come up to me like
"Man, you better not 

[?], you better not do this"
And then they'll play songs that's all like
"I was with these girls like this, I did this girl"
All this type of stuff-
Basically sayin' like
Look, if you follow God
You finna fall off
That Jesus came number one1, 3 weeks
That Jesus born
But not just that, finding that peace
Inside you
Not just the numbers
God using us to show off
To show God is better than the Devil
The Devil took all the producers, the musicians, the designers
Moved us all out to Hollywood
Moved us all out to New York
Chasing ghost statues
Literally signing a contract to selling our souls
They got contracts out there that say you can't say Jesus
When we was working on this album people used to be coming over the studio just to say Jesus as loud as they wanted to
You can say Jesus in Ye studio
You see, I'm like one of them, I'm like a uh uh, a Nineteen Star Michelin chef
The way I cook up, you know what I'm saying
But if the Devil have you serving 8 restaurants at one time
It might drive you crazy
And one of the restaurants could be your own ego
One of them restaurants could be public opinion
One of them restaurants could be legacy
One of them restaurants could be fame
One of them restaurants could be money
But there's only one restaurant we servin' for tonight
And I said tonight 'cause I be in the future sometimes
And that's God's restaurant
Where everybody coming as service to God
And he bringing it back tenfold
A hundredfold
A millionfold
Blessings untold
Blessings harder than gold
Stronger than it go
I returned my soul
To the one that chose me
The one that owns me
The ones that shows me
And that's what God showed me
The Devil controlled me
But he can't hold me
Because God control me
And life has showed me
That God is the only
The real not the phony
The phonies will clone me
Just watch how they cloned me
And 

[?]
I'm here with more homies
I'm here with my families
I don't need a Grammy
I'm back in the building
I'm here with my children
You know it's a feeling
You know it's a feeling
You know it's a feeling

[Outro]
Ahhh la la la la (Yeah, that's that feeling!)
Ahhh la la la la (Yeah, that's that feeling!)
Ahhh la la la la (Yeah, that's that feeling)
La la la la yea
For my Lord and savior, Jesus Christ
Ohhh
Ah ah, ayy
And that's why
They can't tell me nothing
La la la la our Lord and savior Jesus Christ
Laaa la la la la
Accept and receive eternal life
Aaah
They can't tell us nothing (uh uh!)
Yea
Uh uh, they can't tell us nothing
They can't tell us nothing
They can't tell us nothing

[Chorus: Chaster French]
Life in L.A. is so insane
Everyday feels the same
Spent all my cash, I'm down to change
Its time to move away

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Now I was havin chocolate cake and sevian
She said, I ain't no groupie don't get me wrong
But me and my girls wanna get it on
Then I just looked up like she said it wrong
I say bitch don't you know they call me Metatron?
Now I know what you thinkin you should let it go
Let alone, my body's made of metal bones
This played out in my mind a long time ago
She said okay um uh, oh but I got a pound of dro
In the hills we all take pills
We even have designer drugs like strawberry sniff
Strawberry coke? Said yes, I said chill
I don't touch white lines, not even parking my wheels
Bitch you plastic your girls is plastic
Ain't it hot out here? The sun don't melt yall asses?
The place you bought your nose, they showed you a book right?
But when you have a baby what the fuck it gon look like?
Man, lemme go upstairs to my room

[Chorus: Chaster French]
Life in L.A. is so insane
Everyday feels the same
Spent all my cash, I'm down to change
Its time to move away

[Verse 2: Jarmaine Dupri]
Skateboard, I hear what you sayin man
Its kinda hard not to get caught up
Lotta fly shit to be bought up
And the ladies act crazy
Cause thats just the way they brought up
What they parents did, passes to the kid
And so on and so on
And shit, if they rich? then they really gone
I met this bad lil bitch up in Paris' house
Talkin right, like she bout to let a nigga wear it out
Smack her on the ass, talk shit, pull her hair out
I knew it wasn't real but shit, you think I care about that?
I was on her she was lower than Velona from Good Times
Mixed, I was workin tryna show her a good time
And thats when she asked me had I ever did the nasty

You can catch me riding down on the fucking Verrazano
Ass out just like Diallo Diablo
Hi-ho silver, call that motherfucker Tonto
Leave a smoke trail back in Jersey in my condo
You can run up like you're Rambo
But you better hit me nigga if you know what I know
Cause I got some supersize guys that'll hit you with a combo
Pronto, you won't see the morning like Alonzo

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Camo shorts no socks with the red Bapes
Walk in to my closet fuck around and get a headache
Fuck you so good shawty you gonna need a bed break
Red viper slither through the street like a red snake
Red diamonds in my chain looking like a red snake
Fuck with me wrong man, you gonna need some yellow tape
"All them awards, Wayne, do you need a medal case?"

[Refrain: Pharrell]
You got that mean mug grill, that red in your eyes
That ace of spades baby talking big-boy size
Get a stack in each hand and hold it like you're fresh
They say man it's like that
Say yes nigga, yes nigga, yes
Your money and your girls, chilling in the VIP
Stop for a second and gyrate them hips
Get a stack in each hand and hold it like your fresh
If they say man it's like that
Say yes nigga, yes nigga, yes

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yes I make money, I'm a paper machine
And you can catch me in the newest, not the latest machine
"Now, Weezy, why you drive so fast?" Because I'm chasing a dream
And when I catch that motherfucker, I'm a rape it and leave
Yea, Its Young Tunechi, now give me some pussy
I ain't gotta paper chase 'cause my paper come to me
I know money look good
Bitch I know that why you looking huh
Riding by myself in that all-red Enzo
Smoke make it look like I got tinted windows
Young Money, bitch, but for short it's YM, ho
Love that shit so much I went and iced out the symbol
All my niggas scaring you, all your nigga's scarier
Scarier than a cat in a cage with a terrier
Pet cemetery, Wayne, are you the veterinarian?

[Refrain: Pharrell]
You got that mean mug grill, that red in your eyes
That ace of spades baby talking big-boy size
Get a stack in each hand and hold it like you're fresh
They say man it's like that

Your money and your girls, chilling in the VIP
Stop for a second and gyrate them hips
Get a stack in each hand and hold it like your fresh
If they say man it's like that
Say yes nigga, yes nigga, yes

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Yes I do it big, call me Lil Astronomical
Weezy F baby and the 'F' is for phenomenal
Type of nigga go and get his hood 'cross his abdominal
You could check my watch, I been rich a long time ago
I'm so tired of balling, man, I sleep all night
Bed sheets so nice, bed bugs don't bite
I ask her do she wanna fuck, before I ask twice, she say
Yes I am a beast, I swear I needs to be tranquilized
Yes I am a giant, next to me you are just ankle high
Yes I eat that pussy, oh, how do I love that panty pie
Keep my hair shampooed and yes, I keep my hands sanitized
New Orleans baller, ask ESPN
Just kicking it with the Bruce Lee-esbian
"Do you really think you're better than the rest?"
Haha, bitch, I'm the best

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
What's he thinkin'? I mean that nigga buggin'
And got the nerve to be covin
And knowing you ain't in his budget

I give you furs so you can fluff 'em
And when you learn you ain't touchin'
Get what you want girl know I ain't fussin'

You can have it all (Ooh ooh ooh ooh)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]

In the future she'll inherit it

Acknowledge me and I could help you study with geography

So why don't you come and get on top of me

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
What's he thinkin'? I mean that nigga buggin'
And got the nerve to be covin
And knowing you ain't in his budget

[Hook: Pharrell]
Uh, mami, you miss me, don't you?
Haters, wish you could hit me, don't you?
Heh, you should call me uncle
I understand, I'm back by popular demand
That new CL fly
Outside of Popeyes eating chicken and fries
Yeah, come holla at your uncle
I understand, I'm back by popular demand

[Verse 1: Pusha T & Pharrell]
You are now listening to the all-time phenomenal
Used to bag work in VA at the Econo Lo'
Now I'm laying out at the Delano though
But don't get it twisted, the Uzi's in the lining though
Hollow tip dum-dums eat flesh like piranhas though
Such a scary thing to hear the soul sing "Geronimo!"
Pull up in the CL, the shit's astronomical
Hoes lining up on the curb, they fall like dominoes
Used to have this white bitch, she looked like Madonna though
Heard that she fucking LeBron, but shit, I don't know
Like that, Bron-Bron? I had that long time ago
Butt-naked on the balcony at the Dolla-no
I mean the Delano, I mean, Pharrell'll know
The head shop bitch from D.C., ay P, let 'em know!
(Yeah that bitch was hot nigga) Yeah yeah, but it was time to go
Them hoes come in "eenie, meenie, minie-mo"
Yuugh! Mami you miss me, don't you?

[Hook: Pharrell]
Mami, you miss me, don't you?
Haters, wish you could hit me, don't you?
Heh, you should call me uncle
I understand, I'm back by popular demand
That new CL fly
Outside of Popeyes eating chicken and fries
Yeah, come holla at your uncle
I understand, I'm back by popular demand

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Why wouldn't I be? Look at shorty (Dammmn!)
Uh, mami good down to the cuticles, "I'm (Cammm)
What's your name, beautiful?" Like (Mannn)
I could get used to you, woulda (Rannn)
If you knew what I used to do
But call me uncle, yeah, Uncle Cam
I tax 'em (Like who?) Like Uncle Sam
From the jungle, fam, where niggas bundle grams
Fumble or you crumble, get murked on the humble (Annnd)
The gat on the belt on the hip (Annnd)
I keep it for real with the clips
Drive a hard bargain (bargain)
I'm Harlem's only Gagarin, car foreign
The other man stood-stood stutter-fied
I know your moms well, tell your mother "Hi"
I'm the other guy that got your mother high
Coke like a caterpillar, I make butter fly, I

[Hook: Pharrell]
Mami, you miss me, don't you?
Haters, wish you could hit me, don't you?
Heh, you should call me uncle
I understand, I'm back by popular demand
That new CL fly
Outside of Popeyes eating chicken and fries
Yeah, come holla at your uncle
I understand, I'm back by popular demand

[Verse 3: Malice]
Goddamn, the boy's back
From pushing a mountain of Sno-Caps to avoiding the Kojak
The pioneer of the coke rap
I'm dancing with the stars, stepping on blow, doing the toe-tap
The dope returned like I had it on LoJack
It made its way home like a road map, I fathered this
If I misled any kid that's fatherless
That burden's on my soul as long I exist
Generation lost, they saying they can't reach us
The answer is the Lord like "Saturday Night Fever"
I kept it in the crib, it made me a light sleeper
Whether watching for the Feds or avoiding the Grim Reaper
Way deeper than rap, money and hoes, it's deeper than that
Fight the temptation but it keep coming back
Money stacked to the ceiling just as quick as it dispense
Who knew them commas meant you could lose your common sense?
Before it's too late, all I can tell 'em is repent, ugh

[Hook: Pharrell]
Mami, you miss me, don't you?
Haters, wish you could hit me, don't you?
Heh, you should call me uncle
I understand, I'm back by popular demand
That new CL fly
Outside of Popeyes eating chicken and fries
Yeah, come holla at your uncle
I understand, I'm back by popular demand

[Outro: Pharrell]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Daz Dillinger]
It was a girl named Kim a girl named Pam

Rule number one, homie, never trust a chick

[Verse 4: Kurupt]
I ain't mad at ya, li'l mama

[Verse 1]
Ma, the way you huggin' on me, it's a problem
The fuck you tryna end up in the gossip column?
I know I got jewels like I'm the pharoah of the ghetto
But we are and it's a bright-ass shiny Carerra
Stickin' your feet out the window so they can see your stillettos
Cost a thousand dollars, same as your housing holla
Not to mention the wrist and the thirty thousand collar
Pussy must be good, he's victim to your power
Shit, nigga like me? I would never allow it
Spit that shit to me, I would ask you, "Have you showered?"
You wanna get up in my boat and ride
Take pictures with the kid up in Ocean Drive
Go to Casa Tua and just sip on Calouas
At the bar, talkin' to other women about the best jewelers
You like that, huh? Smilin' still, call your girlfriend (Why?)
You fell asleep at the wheel

[Chorus]
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit, raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit
And don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit
Tryna ask me shit, c'mon

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I walk in brashest, certainly the crassest
The restaurant's classes, the owner is asses
Shit, my money green like the helmet of a fascist
So what you want – Patron or Petrucia glasses?
Ain't no mystery, his daughter know the history
And every night we toast like it's victory, get with me
And I ain't changed since my early mental
I been snackin' on shrimp and sippin' on Shirley Temples
No drug to drinkin' – what you want?
No, seriously, what you thinkin'? Since the Yukon
Never puffed a J, you can ask Loushawn
Back when he pushed beige like it was coupons
With a house full of dames like it was Moulin
I would ask they names, but they would only do Sean
And I ain't sayin they regret it, but fuck it, they do
'Cause if they could reverse time, nigga
What would they do, huh?

[Chorus]
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit, raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit
And don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit
Tryna ask me shit, c'mon

[Verse 3]
Honeys Panamanian, eyes like Iranian
Lighter than the blue of the sky of the day we in
Ass like a volleyball, the kind that make your dick hard
Head to the hustlers, so sweet she could get cars
Now she here with me, lil' Skateboard P
Cheaper than the sound of a bird that chirps
I spit, then I hit, then I murk, yessir
A flick chico stick and a Twix, that's her
She admire how the champion live
How I signed Slim Thug with a ramp in my crib
I'm a champion, I do as the champions did
Except I improve with the new and the rest get rid
But some of y'all don't like that, it's easy tryna bite back
Instead of sayin' hi, gettin' fly, but I'll be right back
My dude got the steel if you think you fly
Shoot the wings off your ego and watch you skydive, yessir

[Chorus]
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin all that raspy shit, raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit
And don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit
Tryna ask me shit, c'mon

Lyrics from Snippets

Nowadays, my friends treat me like strangers
They the same ones that say the money gon' change ya
Funny how money came, now they all changed up
Funny how money came, now its all fake love, uh
They say I changed I never changed I just bossed up
I show receipts whenever them bitches talk up
Whenever I see my people they always talk bucks
Cause they see Louis V on my bag, I had problems I told 'em...

...I'm Still kicking it with Kenny from the block
I still got lil homies running from the cops
I still, I still (x2)

I'm still fucking with these bitches from the block
I'm still taking shawtys pancakes on the rocks
I still, I still (x2)
Billie Jean

[Bad Intro]
Who's bad?

[Verse]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor, in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts" (Hee-eeh)
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (Oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!

And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again: Who's bad?

Thriller

[Verse: Michael Jackson]
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah, ooh

[Outro: Vincent Price & Michael Jackson]
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller, ooh, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller night, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh, babe, I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller night, babe
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40 thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!

Black or White/Remember the Time

[Verse 1]
I took my baby on a Saturday
Boy is that girl with you? Yes, we're one and the same
No, I believe in miracles, and a miracle has happened tonight (night, night)
But if you're thinking about my baby, it don't matter if you're black or white

[Rap: L.T.B.]
Protection (Grrrrrat, tat tat, tat)
For gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations  (Grrrrrat, tat tat) (rat, tat tat)
It's a turf war (turf war) (Grrrrrat, tat tat, tat)
On a global scale
I'd rather hear of both sides this tale (Grrrrrat, tat tat) (Hoo!)
You see it's not about races (races) (Grrrrrat, tat tat, tat)
Just places, spaces (spaces) (Grrrrrat, tat tat) (rat, tat tat)
It's where your blood comes from
It's where your face is (Grrrrrat, tat tat, tat)
I've seen the blood get duller
I'm not gonna spend my life bein' a color (Grrrrrat, tat tat) (Hoo!)

[Outro]
(What about, what about)
(What about, what about)
(What about, what about)
(What about, what about)
(What about, what about)
(What about, what about)

(What about, what about) (who's bad?)

Scream

[Verse: Michael and Janet]
I'm tired of injustice, I'm tired of the schemes
The lies are disgusting, so what does it mean, damn it?
You're kicking me down, I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds, the whole system sucks, damn it!
Hoo!
Peek in the shadow, come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong, then you better prove you're right!
You're selling out souls but I care about mine
I've got to get stronger, and I won't give up the fight!

[Pre-Chorus: Michael and Janet]
With such confusion don't it make you want to scream? (Make you want to scream?)
Your bash abusing victimize within the scheme!
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize!

[Chorus: Both]
Somebody please have mercy, cause I just can't take it!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make you just want to scream!

Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'

I took my baby to the doctor with a fever
But nothin' he found

They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' you just want to be startin' somethin'

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'

It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
Lift your head up high and scream out to the world
"I know I am someone," and let the truth unfurl
No one can hurt you now because you know what's true
Yes, I believe in me, so do believe in you

[Verse 1]
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by—
You've been hit by a smooth criminal
OW

[Verse 2]
So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats intimidations

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

Then he struck you a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by—
You've been struck by a smooth criminal
OW

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
(Annie, are you okay?)
I don't know
(Will you tell us, that you're okay)
I don't know
(There's a sound at the window)
I don't know
(That he struck you a crescendo, Annie)
I don't know
(He came into your apartment)
I don't know
(Left the bloodstains on the carpet)
I don't know
(And then you ran into the bedroom)
I don't know
(You were struck down, it was your doom, Annie)
Daggone it
(Annie, are you okay?)
Daggone it, Annie
(Will you tell us, that you're okay)
Daggone it, baby

[Verse 1]
I gave her money, I gave her time
I gave her everything inside one heart could find
I gave her passion, my very soul
I gave her promises and secrets so untold

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows we'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul now
(Who is it?)
I can't take this stuff no more

[Verse 2]
I am the damned, I am the dead
I am the agony inside the dying head
This is injustice, woe unto thee
I pray this punishment would have mercy on me

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows we'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see what will I do

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away
(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

[Bridge]

She just upped and ran away

It is a friend of mine?

Somebody hurt my soul now

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm lying to myself

'Cause the will has brought no fortune

Still I cry alone at night

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night (Dadadada)
Don't you judge of my composure
(Don't be, don't be, don't be judging)

Did she find in someone else?

And it doesn't seem to matter
(She don't bother, she don't bother)
And it doesn't seem right
(She don't want it, she don't want it)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
(She don't want it, she don't want it)
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure

And it doesn't seem right
(Don't you bother)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Hee-hee)

What about sunrise?
What about rain?
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain?
What about killing fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine?

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, this weeping shore?

[Chorus]
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooooooh

[Verse 2]
What have we done to the world?
Look what we've done
What about all the peace

Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war?

I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far

Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooooooh

Hey, what about yesterday?

Heavens are falling down
(What about us?)
I can't even breathe
(What about us?)
What about apathy?
(What about us?)
Ravaging the seas?
(What about us?)
What about forest trails
(Ooh, ooh)
Burnt despite our pleas?
(What about us?)
What about the holy land
(What about it?)
Torn apart by greed?
(What about us?)
Where did we go wrong?
(Ooh, ooh)
Someone tell me why
(What about us?)
What about baby boy?
(What about it?)
What about the days?
(What about us?)
What about all their joy?
Do we give a damn?

Oooooooooh (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
Aaaaaaaaah (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
Oooooooooh

[Verse 1]
I was wandering in the rain
(Mask of life, feelin' insane)
Swift and sudden fall from grace
(Sunny days seem far away)
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
(Stalin's tomb won't let me be)
On and on and on it came
(Wish the rain would just let me)

[Chorus]
How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
When you're alone
And you're cold inside

[Verse 2]
Here abandoned in my fame
(Armageddon of the brain)
KGB was doggin' me
(Take my name and just let me be)
Then a beggar boy called my name
(Happy days will drown the pain)
On and on and on it came
And again, and again, and again...
(Take my name and just let me be)

[Chorus]
How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel? (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
When you're alone
And you're cold inside

How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel? (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
When you're alone
And you're cold inside

Like stranger in Moscow, Lord have mercy
Like stranger in Moscow, Lord have mercy
We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger, baby
Like stranger in Moscow
We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger, baby
Like stranger in Moscow
I'm living lonely
I'm living lonely, baby
Stranger in Moscow

[Chorus]
Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by
If you smile
With your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just...

[Chorus]
Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by

There's a ghost out in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's coming down the stairs
Then there's screaming in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna be, exactly what you wanna see
It's you who's haunting me, 'cause you're wanting me
To be the stranger in your life

Am I amusing you, or just confusing you?
Am I the beast you visualized?
And if you want to to see, eccentrialities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes

Let them all materialize

[Chorus]
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh
Is it scary for you, baby?
Is it scary for you?

You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby?

[Verse 2]
There's a creak beneath the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna be exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me to see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes?

A haunting ghostly treat, the foolish trickery
And spirits dancing in the light
But if you came to see, the truth the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start

[Chorus]
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh
So tell me, is it scary for you baby?

So tell me, is it crazy for you baby?
Am I scary for you?

You know the stranger is you
Am I scary for you?

[Bridge]
Masquerade the heart
To hide a hurting soul
Trust not what you see of me
Cause the heart reveal the proof, like a mirror reveals the truth
See the evil one is you

[Chorus]
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is it scary for you?
So tell me am I scary for you baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is scary for you baby?
Am I scary for you?
(I don't want to talk about it)

[Chorus]
Is this scary for you?
I'm tired of being abused
You know you're scaring me too
I see the evil is you
Is it scary for you, baby?

[Verse 1]
There's a ghost out in the hall

Billie Jean is always talkin' when nobody else is talkin'
Tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always tryin'

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus 1: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah, ooh

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

[Chorus 2: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller (Woo-hoo), thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
They're open wide
This is the end of your life, ooh

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]
They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side, ooh
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

[Chorus 3: Michael Jackson]
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Woo-hoo), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Woo-hoo), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, OW

[Outro: Michael Jackson & Vincent Price]
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh, thriller
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Oh darlin, I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh baby, I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Oh darlin', thriller night, baby, ooh
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller

[Verse 1]
Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain’t nothin' that you can do
Relax your mind

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (Woo)
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
(Hee hee hee, no no, hee hee hee, ooh)

As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

[Intro: Rick Ross]
Yeah, good looking E-Class
I dig it
What, trilla, realer than fuck niggas

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
You know me, I walk up in the spot
The babies be going crazy, while niggas barely dipping
You know they got that (that street money, that street, that street money)
(That street money, that street, that street money)
You know me, I stay up on my grind
Like working that 9 to 5
Bucket in that '95
I'm out to get that (that street money, that street, that street money)
(That street money, that street, that street money)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I started flat broke, now I'm popping rubber bands
I know I'm the shit, I done ate a ton of spam
If the club popping, I'mma burn a hundred grams
Check the parking lot, that whip cost a hundred grand
I'm in love with shades, I got a thousand pairs
So that's free game, for all you thousandaires
It's funny, sour diesel smell sweet
All these niggas think they sell em on Canal Street
I'm sitting 12 feet, the fuck can you tell me
I let the 12s beat, nightmare on Elm Street
So don't fall asleep, 'cause my life a dream
And they ain't gotta speak, they know I'm spitting cheese

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
You know me, I walk up in the spot
The babies be going crazy, while niggas barely dipping
You know they got that (that street money, that street, that street money)
(That street money, that street, that street money)
You know me, I stay up on my grind
Like working the 9 to 5
Bucket in that '95
I'm out to get that (that street money, that street, that street money)
(That street money, that street, that street money)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
We got them bottles popping, sounding like they gun shots
Got them models bopping, get it all with one watch
I hit a lot of markets, start em off with one block
People love the product, so my people come to shop
My uncle 65, he still selling dope
He claim he petrified, the fear of going broke
It's them Caddy Sevilles, went from acid and pills
To elaborate deals, if you want status you kill
Cause a habit for real, when I step in the spot
Treat the club like the charts, I go straight to the top
They cost a stack, so don't step on the shoes
Hey you know I'm strapped, I'mma play by the rules

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
You know me, I walk up in the spot
The babies be going crazy, while niggas barely dipping
You know they got that (that street money, that street, that street money)
(That street money, that street, that street money)
You know me, I stay up on my grind
Like working the 9 to 5
Bucket in that '95
I'm out to get that (that street money, that street, that street money)
(That street money, that street, that street money)

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Take the good with the bad, in the club blowing your last
Balling like I'm violated, bottles keep me hydrated
Party up in skyscrapers, parachute to Privet
Pistol like a paratrooper, tell 'em take it easy
Bitches bad as can be, this is a fan-ta-ta-tasy
Left her panties at home, standing as thick as can be
R-I-C-K, R-O-S-S
Standing there, dressed fresh
Getting pussy, hell yes
(Ross, Ross)

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
You know me, I walk up in the spot
The babies be going crazy, while niggas barely dipping
You know they got that (that street money, that street, that street money)
(That street money, that street, that street money)
You know me, I stay up on my grind
Like working that 9 to 5
Bucket in that '95
I'm out to get that (that street money, that street, that street money)
(That street money, that street, that street money)

I finally found my crocodile drawings
They were under your bed
At least that's what my dream said
None of them were green
Because none of them are
Do you think I'm obscene?
That's what I heard in my dream

[Chorus: Nathan]
And you go 'round talking 'bout everything that happened
Or could ever be a possibility, and I'm just thinking
You're so loud talking 'bout everything that happened
Or could ever be a possibility, and I'm just thinking
You're allowed, talking 'bout everything that happened
Or could ever be a possibility, and I'm just thinking
Where to now?

[Verse 2: Nathan]
I'm on a binge of the benders that you hated
So I walked into your fridge
At least that's what my dream said
Can I get an inch, or will you take a mile?
I'm looking ahead
At least that's what my dream said

[Chorus: Nathan]
And you go 'round talking 'bout everything that happened
Or could ever be a possibility, and I'm just thinking
You're so loud talking 'bout everything that happened
Or could ever be a possibility, and I'm just thinking
You're allowed, talking 'bout everything that happened
Or could ever be a possibility, and I'm just thinking
Where to now?

[Intro]
Help
I need somebody, help
Not just anybody, help
I need somebody, please, please help me

[Verse 1]
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in anyway
But now those days are gone, and I’m not so self assured
Not fine, change my mind, and open up the door

[Chorus]
Help me if you can, I’m feeling down
And I do appreciate you being ‘round
Oh, help me get my feet back on the ground
Won’t you please, please help me?

[Verse 2]
And now my life is changed in oh so many ways
My independence seemed to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I need you like I’ve never done before

[Chorus]
Help me if you can, I’m feeling down
And I do appreciate you being ‘round
Oh help me get my feet back on the ground
Won’t you please, please help me?
Help me, help me, help me, ya

[Verse 3]
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody’s help in anyway
But now those days are gone, and I’m not so self assured
Not fine, change my mind, and open up the door

[Chorus]
Help me if you can, I’m feeling down
And I do appreciate you being ‘round
Oh help me get my feet back on the ground
Won’t you please, please help me?
Help me if you can, I’m feeling down
And I do appreciate you being ‘round
Oh help me get my feet back on the ground
Won’t you please, please help me?
Help me, help me

[Chorus]
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys (XCX)
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Verse 1]
I need that bad boy to do me right on a Friday
And I need that good one to wake me up on a Sunday
That one from work can come over on Monday night
I want 'em all, I want 'em all
And when they finally leave me, I'm all alone but
I'm lookin' down and my girls are blowin' my phone up
Them twenty questions, they askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse
Like my house was hit by a tsunami

[Chorus]
But I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Verse 2]
In every city I've got one with different ringtones
Flyin' from L.A. all the way to Puerto Rico
My girls are callin' me askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse
Like my house was hit by a tsunami

[Chorus]
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

[Bridge]
Don't be mad, don't be mad at me (No, no, no, no)
Darling, I can't stop it even if I wanted
Don't be mad, don't be mad at me (No, no, no, no)
Missed what you were sayin', I was miles away, yeah
Don't be mad, don't be mad
Not like I had a choice
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys

[Chorus]
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

I took my baby to the doctor with a fever
But nothing he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone's always trying
To start my baby crying
Talking, squealing, lying
Saying you just want to be startin' somethin'

[Chorus]
I said you want to be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you want to be startin' somethin'

Someone's always trying
To keep my baby crying
Treacherous, cunning, declining
You got my baby crying (Hee)

[Verse 1]
What about sunrise?
What about rain?
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain?
What about killing fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine?

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you ever stop to notice?
All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice?
This crying earth, its weeping shore

[Chorus]
Aaaah! Oooh!
Aaaah! Oooh!

[Verse 2]
What have we done to the world?
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son?
What about flowering fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine?

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you ever stop to notice?
All the children dead from war?
Did you ever stop to notice?
This crying earth, its weeping shore?

[Chorus]
Aaaah! Oooh!
Aaaah! Oooh!

[Instrumental break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you ever stop to notice?
All the blood we've shed before?
Did you ever stop to notice?
This crying earth, its weeping shore?

[Chorus]
Aaaah! Oooh!
Aaaah! Oooh!

[Instrumental]
When you're weary, feeling small
When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all, all
I'll take your part, oh, when times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'm on your side, when darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Sail on silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
Oh, if you ever need a friend
I'm sailing behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind

[Verse 1]
I knew from the start
That I loved you with all my heart
But you were untrue
You had another lover and she looked just like you

[Chorus]
Bambi, can't you understand?
Bambi, it's better with a man

[Ad lib]
Think it ain't?
Watch this

[Guitar Solo]

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Just the other day, shit was all cool
Now I can't catch a break, thinking 'bout you
I promised that I wouldn't, but I ran back to you
'Cause one more night alone, just might not be good for
What got into you? Why you acting brand new for?
And what I ever do? Maybe I just took it too far
I did fall apart, maybe I was a little too much
And now I'm thinking too much, drank a little too much

[Chorus]
But I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
And I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
'Cause it's all a little too much, and I'm in need of your love
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you

[Verse 2]
You used to say it was forever, I remember
Tryna' forget, I can't forget ya
Still got your makeup on my sweater
And I know that it's all over, But memories live forever
For the worse or for the better
Can't let you go, my heart won't let her
Can't let you go and you know it
Yeah, I put my all in, I gave you whatever
Gave you my heart and you broke it, yeah
You were so selfish, did nothing to help me
And I was so blinded, but I couldn't help it

[Chorus]
But I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
And I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
'Cause it's all a little too much, and I'm in need of your love
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
But I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
And I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you
'Cause it's all a little too much, and I'm in need of your love
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I felt before
I'm running back to you, I'm running back to you

[Verse 1: Michael & Siedah]
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Both & Siedah]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
Cause I just can't stop loving you

[Verse 2: Michael & Siedah & Both]
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do"
"I do"
This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well, my Life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Michael & Both]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you

We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey, Farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always

[Chorus: Both]
I just can't stop loving you (No, baby)
I just can't stop loving you (If I can't stop)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do (What will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you (Hee-hee-hee, without you, girl)
I just can't stop loving you (You know I do)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do

Aaow!
Cha!
Shoo-cha-choo-cha!

[Verse 1]
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

You were struck down
It was your doom

If I came back as a dolphin
Would you listen to me then?
Would you let me be your friend?

It's not working how you want it
You know that I'm not being honest
I never meant to hurt you
I'm not perfect, but I know it
Words can't even make up cause I show it
I know you don't see me how you once saw me
I know that it's meaningless to say sorry
You keep on blowing up my phone
I know I'm wrong, I know it
You don't wanna hear my words
You just want me to show it

[Chorus]
Oh, baby
I know you said that you hate me
But after all, I'm the one you call

[Verse 2]
Oh, you can't be serious
You're treating me like a idiot
Oh, shut the fuck up
I ain't hearing it
That's all I hear you say
Oh, you gotta be kidding me
I just want you to be real with me
And why the fuck ain't you here with me?
Oh, all you do is complain

[Chorus]
Oh, baby
I know you said that you hate me
But after all, I'm the one you call
Oh, baby
I know you said that you hate me
But after all, I'm the one you call

Whole life bein’ thugs
No choice, sellin' drugs

Mass incarc', what it does
'Cause a cause, what it does
'Nother life bein' lost
That's all for the cost
Executes in thirty states
Thirty states still execute
Thou shall not kill, thou shall not throw
Stomp, stomp with the residue
Cashed on, what the leather do
Last song what the better do
Now it's time for the residue
Ones that never do, hunnid they never do

[Chorus]
Rain down on us
Rain down on us
Wash us in the blood

Holy spirit, come down

They don't want Kanye to be Kanye
They wanna sign a fake Kanye, they tryna sign a calm ’Ye
I call that nigga Calm-Ye, 'cause he's down with an army
That song is what I all make, everything you see is all me
They wanna edit the interviews, they wanna take it to interludes
Cut a whole sentence to inner loose
Tryna put something in interview

[?] long as I'm in the booth
Hot as the sun when they bend the truth
Livin’ 'cause nobody livin'
And nobody's different, and doin' it different

[Verse 1]
There's a ghost out in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's coming down the stairs
Then there's spirit in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air?
Ghosts be hiding everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna be
Exactly what you wanna see
It's you whose taunting me
Because you're warning me
To be the stranger in your life
Am I amusing you?
Or just confusing you?
Am I the beast you visualized?
And if you wanna see eccentricalities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes
Let them all materialize

[Chorus]
Is that scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?

[Verse 2]
There's a creaking in the floor
There's a creep behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin that lay open
Where a restless soul has spoken

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna be
Exactly what you've come to see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes
A haunting ghostly treat
The ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see
The truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start

[Chorus]
Is that scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Tell me, hoo!

[Bridge]
Masquerade the heart
Is it the height of hurting souls
I'm just not what you seek of me
Can the heart reveal the proof
Like a mirror reveals the truth
See the evil one is you

[Outro]
Is that scary for you, baby?
Tell me, hoo!
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Tell me, hoo!
Hoo, hoo!
Ooh baby

[Verse 2]
Watch me get 'em like Kobe, yeah
Sick with it, no COVID, yeah
Black clouds break open, yeah
Rain down black roses, yeah
I smell the rose, now I'm focused, yeah
The game is cold, but I'm frozen, yeah
The lanes are closed, but I'm bowling, yeah
All Mamba, no cobras, uh
All around, no borders, uh
All eyes take notice, uh
Recognize my importance, uh
Never die, I'm immortal, uh
Got the culture on my shoulders, uh
See the vultures flying over
Now we marchin' like we soldiers
'Til we walkin' like we strollin', yeah
Sixty points in my last game like that's game, yeah, yerr
Put five rings on my last name, Oscar could've been my first
On one leg, on my last leg, I want the last shot, that's work
No Achilles Heel, I told Phil, "It's the last dance, now twerk"

[Bridge]
Heart gold, beatin' out my chest, and it goes rat-tata-tata
This is Black entertainment, baby, this is Black power status, yeah
Two fingers for the Mambacita, I'm screamin' Black Mamba matters, yeah
Heart goes out to Vanessa and the whole Black Mamba family, BMF
Heart is gold, it's beatin' out my chest, and it goes rat-tata-tata, yeah
This is Black entertainment, baby, this is Black power status, yeah
Two fingers for the Mambacita, I'm screamin' Black Mamba matters, yeah
Heart goes out to Vanessa and the whole Black Mamba family

[Outro]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro]
Ohhh

[Verse]
Baby, it's not complicated
Don't mind me, I'm intoxicated
Just wanna ride in your Corvette down Melrose
But you, don't seem too fascinated
With the vibe I've been cultivating
Are you picking me up tonight?
Or should I get drink without you?
(It's only four p.m)
But I'm getting wasted again
With or without you (Yeah)
Just wanna ride in your Corvette
So are you picking me up tonight?

One hundred times
One fucking hundred times
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
Won't until it take me
The devil weak, the devil weak
Devil thought I 

[?]
Bought her a ceiling
I've been back from addiction
I done beat they prediction...

[Verse 1]
Those candles that you bought me for Christmas
I can't burn them 'cause they smell like you
And every time I walk into a Starbucks, I see you at every table
It's been a while since I've had cold brew

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know how hard it is to find a decent guy
In this city of four-thousand? Where everybody looks like you?
Don't even get me started on the way you saw this song online
And called, told me you didn't, but you did and I have proof that

[Chorus]
You ruined The 1975, now I listen and think about getting high
In your bedroom, windows open
Mom is home but we're still smokin
You ruined The 1975, now I listen and cry 'cause you sang
"We share friends in Soho"
While you told me that none of your friends know

[Post-Chorus]
And I hated you for that but it's been two years now
And I really just hate you
For making me hate my favorite band

[Verse 2]
You broke my heart then went away to college
You were only fifteen minutes down the road
And I always thought you'd show up to say sorry
But as time went on, I started to lose hope

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know how hard it is to find a decent guy
When you never gave me closure? What the hell was I to do?
Don't even get me started on the way you saw this song online
I guess it must've thrown you 'cause you called and said you knew that

[Bridge]
I stayed quiet, but I probably should've told ya
Every night I would cry and wish I didn't know ya
I said nothin' and now I got issues
I'll bill you for the tear-stained tissues
Oh, I don't think you have that kind of dough 'cause

[Chorus]
You ruined The 1975, now I listen and think about getting high
In your bedroom, windows open
Mom is home but we're still smoking
You ruined The 1975, now I listen and cry 'cause you sang
"We share friends in Soho"
While you told me that none of your friends know

[Outro]
And I hated you for that but it's been two years now
And I really just hate you
For making me hate my favorite band

[Intro]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?

[Verse 1]
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

[Pre-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

[Post-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

[Refrain]
You've been hit by—
You've been hit by—
A Smooth Criminal

[Verse 2]
So they came in to the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidation

[Pre-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Annie, are you okay? Are you okay?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

[Post-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

[Refrain]
You've been hit by—
You've been struck by—
A Smooth Criminal

[Interlude]
Okay, I want everybody to clear the area right now!

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie
Annie, are you okay? (Annie, are you okay?)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (So, Annie, are you okay?)
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment (Annie, are you okay?)
Left the bloodstains on the carpet (So, Annie, are you okay?)
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie

[Outro]
Annie, are you okay? (I don't know)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (I don't know)
There's a sound at the window (I don't know)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie? (I don't know)
He came into your apartment (I don't know)
Left bloodstains on the carpet (I don't know why, baby)
And then you ran into the bedroom (Help me)
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie (Dag gone it)
Annie, are you okay? (Annie, are you okay?)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (So, Annie, are you okay?)
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment (Annie, are you okay?)
Left the bloodstains on the carpet (So, Annie, are you okay?)
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie
Annie are you okay? (Dag gone it-baby)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (Dag gone it-baby)
There's a sound at the window (Dag gone it-baby)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie
He came into your apartment, (Dag gone it)
Left bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down (Dag gone it)
It was your doom Annie
Lyrics from snippet:

[Verse]
Can you take me to euphoria, according to the story of a warrior?
Picturin' my visions, have you look inside my cornea
Sunny California, sleepin' when the mornin' come
Movie theater in my crib, private auditorium (Uh)
Take you on a tour of the 

[?] Deloreans
Drive around the ground, we pour a 40 in
Champion of the tournament, the world's ornament
Fallin' to the Earth just to show you that we porcelain

[?] from Nova Scotia, was local but no exposure
I told 'em the show was over, it's all on both of my shoulders

[Chorus]
Take me to a place, covered from head to toe in gold (I wanna go)
Find a space with skies 

[?]
And the weather never 

[?]
Don't leave me, don't let me die alone (No)
No, you can't leave me and let me die alone

[Intro]
I just want to lay next to you for a while
You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold you
I need you, God I need you
I love you so much

[Verse 1: Michael & Siedah]
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Both & Siedah]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
Cause I just can't stop loving you

[Verse 2: Michael & Siedah & Both]
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do"
"I do"
This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well, my Life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Michael & Both]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you

[Bridge: Michael & Siedah & Both]
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey, Farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always

[Chorus: Both]
I just can't stop loving you (No, baby)
I just can't stop loving you (If I can't stop)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do (What will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you (Hee-hee-hee, without you, girl)
I just can't stop loving you (You know I do)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do

[Intro]
(Fox!)
If you don't wanna see me

[Verse 1]
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(Don't, don't, don't)

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now, 'bout me)

[Bridge]
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now (Oh)
Up, up
Don't come out, out
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up (Don't show up), don't come out (Don't come out)
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now)
Walk away (Walk away), you know how (You know how)
Don't start caring about me now (So)

[Outro]
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away (So)
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away, oh

[Intro]
One, one, one, one, one

[Verse 1]
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

[Refrain]
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
(I got new rules, I count 'em)
I got new rules, I count 'em
(I gotta tell them to myself)
I got new rules, I count 'em
(I got new rules, I count 'em)
I got new rules, I count 'em
(I gotta tell them to myself)

[Verse 2]
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

[Refrain]
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
(I got new rules, I count 'em)
I got new rules, I count 'em
(I gotta tell them to myself)
I got new rules, I count 'em
(I got new rules, I count 'em)
I got new rules, I count 'em
(I gotta tell them to myself)

[Bridge]
Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I (I got new)

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone (yeah)
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (alone)
Two: Don't let him in (uh-ooh)
You'll have to kick him out again (again)
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
(I got new rules, I count 'em)
I got new rules, I count 'em
(I gotta tell them to myself)
I got new rules, I count 'em
(I got new rules, I count 'em)
I got new rules, I count 'em
(I gotta tell them to myself)

[Outro]
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
You're gettin' over him

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
Falling into you, baby
Even electricity can't compare to what I feel
When I'm with you
Ooh, baby
Giving up my ghost for you
And now I'm see-through

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you've been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently

Wide awake and in my dreams

Ooh, baby
If you only saw a friend in me
I'd be bittersweet

And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you

I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny

They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

[Speaker]: Producer Quincy Jones was recently asked to speak about his experiences during the recording of 'Off The Wall'

[Quincy Jones]:
I mean Michael's an amazing songwriter
And it is so highly personal
You see when you work with songwriters and I've worked with a lot- I mean, with singer-songwriters I've worked with a lot of 'em
So it's lonely, you know? He, uh-
He dug in
He dug in
Sometimes he was not sure it was going the right way
But after a while, you know, he got it
By his second album, he wrote three songs on the first album and wrote four on the  Thriller

[Quincy Jones]:
Michael brought in Don't Stop ’Til You Get Enough

[?]
And Off The Wall and Workin' Day and Night was the last thing he brought in
He'd been working on that because the album has been picking up some steam
Get on the Floor was a track that the Brothers Johnson had been doing for an album on an end and they hadn’t been molded to it so, Michael heard that and liked it and I said "Brothers Johnson's are writing great stuff and you guys should collaborate"
So that happened with that
The following is Michael's original 1978 demo recording of Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, the sort of percussion including cabasa, cowbell and glass bottles were played by Michael, brother Randy and sister Janet
Next, we take a behind the scenes peak at Michael's 1978 home demo of Workin' Day and Night, Michael, Randy and Janet provided a sort of percussion on the demo

[Verse 1]
Know my heart and everything, time
Fighting in the deep
Sorry, I can live, pain
Nothing wrong with me

Duh na na na na, feel those days (Feel those days)
My heart's out for you (Out for you)
Somebody just say my name, yeah
Anything
So tell me now

[Chorus]
Someone put your hand down
Begging for your love
All I do is hand out, heart that needs your love

[Verse 2]
Say your words turn on me, see
All on me everyday
Cause la la, I can feel. Yeah
Heard a word, I’m upset
I'm being hurt and it's all (All in vain)
My heart's out for you (Out for you)
Somebody just save (Save my life), yeah
Anything
So tell me now, say

[Chorus]
Someone put your hand out
Begging for your love
All I do is hand out, heart that needs your love
Someone put your hand out
Begging for your love
All I do is hand out, heart that needs your love

Soon you'll hear my heart ache
Listen to my heart ache

How come you're ain't heart ache

Being hurt and it's all (All in vain)
My heart's out for you (Out for you)
Somebody just save (Save my life), yeah
I don't care, so tell me now, say

Begging for your love
All I do is hand out, a heart that needs your love
Someone put your hand out

You were there before we came
You took the hurt, you took the shame
They built the walls to block your way
You beat them down, you won the day
It wasn't right, it wasn't fair
You taught them all, you made them care
Yes, you were there, and thanks to you
There's now a door we all walkthrough
And we are here, for all to see...
To be the best that we can be
Yes, I am here...
Because... you... were... there

It's been a wonderful day
Please, keep me company
While I'm waiting at you
All day for you, yeah

All day for you

My bitch got APs, no apologies
Ranned up a million dollars then I iced out her
I turned to Austin Powers, then I copped a Spur, yeah
Her neck on Eiffel Tower, do she bite? Yes, sir, yeah
I fucked 'round and put diamonds on her goddamn purse, yeah

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Huh?
(30, you a motherfuckin' fool, nigga)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
She a tease, real calm, not skeezo
Real fiend for the bling, bling, blingo
Got cheese, I can really say bingo
I'm a star, but I'm nothin' like Ringo
Golf windows on the door like Jagged Edge
Hell no, my name's not Wingo
Gringo limpin' out of the casino
Where's Waldo? Lookin' for the cargo
My main foes fell off, where did they go?
In Diego lookin' for the yayo
I met a Mexican man that'll bust a head
And for a peso, he'll make you wait, though

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Yeah, that's my breasto, that's my besto
My vest on my chest, he protect my flesh, so
Let my best ho invest my escrow
Bless her flesh 'cause she made my nest grow
Bullets start ricocheting, think I need an echo
Earthquake, aftershock, bitch just won't let go
Family callin' for him, lookin', think they need to let go
Hope they got insurance for him, probably need gecko

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Drop my nuts, don't push my test
Throw your foot on they neck, protect your threshold
This the type of pressure, you don't need no stretcher
Or the ambulance and then I let the alligator get you
Bullets go to rippin', make the neighbors start trippin'
Trap closin' early 'cause the Gucci Mane comin'
Gucci Mane LaFlare, I got all kind of money
Five thou', fifty thou', anybody count it (Well, damn)
All I really care about is did you do the business?
Did you leave a witness? Nigga, did you pay attention?
Heard what I said, nigga? Anybody get it
I don't give a damn, nigga, you can really get it
Mama in the business, then your mama 'nem can get it
Broad down with it, whole family can get it
You stupid little bitch, you put yourself in this position
All this inchin' on my riches got my trigger finger itchin'

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Yeah, that's my breasto, that's my besto
My vest on my chest, he protect my flesh, so
Let my best ho invest my escrow
Bless her flesh 'cause she made my nest grow
Bullets start ricocheting, think I need an echo
Earthquake, aftershock, bitch just won't let go
Family callin' for him, lookin', think they need to let go
Hope they got insurance for him, probably need gecko

[Verse 3: Foogiano]
Gotta keep a breasto just because my neck froze
Try to take my bankroll, I'ma leave his eyes closed
Me and Wop together, all these bitches goin' psycho
Where we keep them poles like a motherfuckin' pint store
I come from the gutter (Mob)
Now my mouth full of ice, she suck me like a sucker
Shit done gave me poltergeist and I would never love her
Better try that other guy, just blow me like a bubble
And I'll cum on your pretty side, yeah, I'm rich forever
My bitch do not come around
She don't wanna double cross 'cause bitch, I'm the triple cross
I'll get 'em knocked off, sit back, use my dental floss
Yeah, it's the Mayor, told you I'm the fuckin' boss
Wop said, "Get this in your Mob and it's gon' go down"
Send his head to his mama house to say I'm lowdown
1017, So Icy Boyz, and we don't fuck 'round
Bitch, I got my breasto, we can have a showdown, ho

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Yeah, that's my breasto, that's my besto
My vest on my chest, he protect my flesh, so
Let my best ho invest my escrow
Bless her flesh 'cause she made my nest grow
Bullets start ricocheting, think I need an echo
Earthquake, aftershock, bitch just won't let go
Family callin' for him, lookin', think they need to let go
Hope they got insurance for him, probably need gecko

[Intro: Pooh Shiesty]
Mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm
Got it locked through Atlanta
Yeah, yeah
Got a lot to handle
(SpiffoMadeIt, bitch)
Brr, big brr

[Chorus: Pooh Shiesty]
Ayy, Fox 13, we rep that murder gang, we don't do no attempts
Hop out on the slammer with this chopper like I'm Shawn Kemp
Drew down on him with his pants down in front of U of M
1017 Shiesty Gang, I got them folks like, "Who is him?"
Bitch, you try me and get whacked, I promise this is not the way
Know she wanna fuck 'cause she keep staring in my Cartier
I think about guns and money sixty times throughout the day
Nobody safe, you can't go get shit to stop these .308s, on God

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Entertain like Cedric, had that codeine in my beverage
Way back in day, let them niggas use me for leverage (Well, damn)
F on my report card, on my hip, I got an F&N
Pulled up on me poppin', but he won't pull up and pop again
I don't care 'bout who he is or who his kin, just do him in
Cold, dark pool, they threw him in, I just shot off his chin (Burr)
Murder case, Snoop Dogg, back in the day, no juice and gin (Snoop)
And I'm the coach, I'm with the G.O.A.T.s, we go for it on fourth and ten (Go)
Always was the robber where we stayed, so I didn't play with 'em
Police don't even try to talk to Wop, got nothin' to say to 'em
Five-shot, .38 on me, put a trey to him
Big dawg in the yard, took a nigga tray from him

[Chorus: Pooh Shiesty]
Ayy, Fox 13, we rep that murder gang, we don't do no attempts
Hop out on the slammer with this chopper like I'm Shawn Kemp
Drew down on him with his pants down in front of U of M
1017 Shiesty Gang, I got them folks like, "Who is him?"
Bitch, you try me and get whacked, I promise this is not the way
Know she wanna fuck 'cause she keep staring in my Cartier
I think about guns and money sixty times throughout the day
Nobody safe, you can't go get shit to stop these .308s, on God

[Verse 2: Pooh Shiesty]
Niggas starve theyself, the whole time, somethin' to eat in they face
Look at that lil' nigga from the Creek, his ass done made a way
I ain't just go put food on the table, I passed out the plates
I'm missing Tre, ain't nobody have me like my nigga Day
It's time to slide
Walk with a hundred up in the chopper, I shot eighty-five
Mix them Percocets with the exotic, I'm back energized
Do donuts up in the 'Cat, drive it like it got nine lives
You ain't take 'em down with me, nigga, so is you not my slime
Niggas talkin' out they neck, but that lil' shit won't slow me up
Two double cups, big congratulations, time to pour me up
We rollin' up, mixin' different flavors, keep my 'Wood stuffed
If you got somethin' dancin' on your wrist, it's time to hold it up

[Chorus: Pooh Shiesty]
Ayy, Fox 13, we rep that murder gang, we don't do no attempts
Hop out on the slammer with this chopper like I'm Shawn Kemp
Drew down on him with his pants down in front of U of M
1017 Shiesty Gang, I got them folks like, "Who is him?"
Bitch, you try me and get whacked, I promise this is not the way
Know she wanna fuck 'cause she keep staring in my Cartier
I think about guns and money sixty times throughout the day
Nobody safe, you can't go get shit to stop these .308s, on God

[Outro: Pooh Shiesty]
On Chopper Gang, on So Icy G, this my squad

Nigga, 413 Gang, ayy (SpiffoMadeIt, bitch)
1017 on my damn chain, brr

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Not going to Iran, I'm not going to Iran
Free all the shootas (Yeah)
Never backed down from a man, nigga, I ain't never ran

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Never backed down from a man, nigga, I ain't never ran (No, no)
If they book me for the draft, I'm not goin' to Iran (No)
Call me Gucci Peter Pan, I keep flyin' to the bands (Ah)
I do stunts like Jackie Chan, I just touched down in Japan
Since they let me out the can, I keep runnin' up the bands
In the Arab with the sand, I'm so hot, I need a fan (Hot)
I'm so black, can't get no tan (Ah), but I feel like I'm the man
I put diamonds in my bands, ice so cold, can't feel my hands

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I can't go to war for nobody
Bitch, I got my own bodies (Yeah)
Everybody got a couple skeletons in the closet (Huh?)
Bodies go to droppin', it's on and poppin'
Me and my niggas went shoppin' for choppas (Pow)
Bought bombs and bazookas, is that what you want? (Pow, pow)
Life of a sniper, pray for my rifle
Pray for my rubber then shootin' my rival
I don't go to sleep, I just drink with my Bible
Thinkin' 'bout bringin' home member survivors
Jump off the tower, money and power
Send me to war, but you nothin' but a coward (Woo)
Children in Broward, students at Howard (Yeah)
Play with my life 'cause you feel you in power (Pussy)
Bum in a blouse that blew out our boss
Got caught then got raped then got for tortured for hours
Think I'ma lick, got a stick in my trouser
Reroll machine, I'm piledrivin' the powder
Flag on your casket then send ya some flowers
Gucci on bucket, I'm tellin' ya now (It's Gucci)
I see my opp, then I'm gunnin' him down
Tell my lawyer to start pointin' him out (Him)
Know what he do, so I keep him around (Him)
Gave him the bag and he didn't say a sound

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & K Shiday]
Never backed down from a man, nigga, I ain't never ran (No)
If they book me for the draft, I'm not going to Iran (No)
Call me Gucci Peter Pan (It's Gucci), I keep flyin' to the bands
I do stunts like Jackie Chan, I just touched down in Japan
Since they let me out the can, I keep runnin' up the bands
In the Arab with the sand, I'm so hot, I need a fan (Hot)
I'm so black, can't get no tan (Ah), but I feel like I'm the man
I put diamonds in my bands, ice so cold, can't feel my hands (So icy)

[Verse 2: K Shiday]
Real shooter, been reckless (Uh)
Put them boys on my guest list (Woah)
.50 cal on my resume, 1017 on my necklace (Word)
If I slap a mag and put it in the dirt (Yeah)
It's just automatic reflexes (Woo)
Got two bad bitches from Texas (Yeah)
I might slap a ho if she messy (Ah)
I burn them off for my kids
Damn, I'm legit
Pour the Johnson with the shit (Who?)
I break 'em off like a Kit-Kat
Hard as a brick, ain't got no time for no kickback
I'm a motherfuckin' veteran (Yeah)
Obama is my president (Yeah)
Might pull up to your residence
Friendly fire, bitch, I'm negligent
Open fire, I might fine ya (Woo)
Pin the gun, White House might blind ya (Ooh)
Damn, my conduct so disorderly
I check a nigga quarterly (Mmm)
They closin' up the doors for me (Yup)
Might slip, my drip too watery (Oh)
You can blame it on the saucery (Uh)
Eat a pill, bitch, take it orally

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci
Gucci just gave me M's, haha
Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci (Yeah, no cap, Wop)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Chillin' on the beach with my million-dollar freak, I let the water clean the sand out her sandals
Came a long way from trappin' out a shotgun house in Alabama, passing eagles like Randall
Red carpet shawty with a bitch like a Barbie and a tailor-made suit from Alessandro
I did a robbery, a nigga tried to buck on the pistol, I reversed it and hit him with the handle

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Yeah, it's hard, but it's fair, but it's tough on a square
You know salt kill snails, not players
Sell water to a whale, put a whale on a scale
When the hammer hit the motherfuckin' nail
Send a bale in the mail, fuck the judge and the jury
And the jail and the motherfuckin' cell
Know Chanel and it's Gucci, you can tell
You can smell, I'm a player, pull up in a V12
I wear Gucci all the time, if I'm lyin', then I'm flyin'
This exclusive, can't get it online
Shawty party all the time, and she fine, dead fine
And the bills, she don't pay 'em no mind
Tailormade, I don't do the cleaners no more
Light billi', I don't really spend M's no more
Stadiums, I don't do arenas no more
Fuck handcuffs, I don't wanna see 'em no more
Italian stallion, Rocky Balboa
Plug with the cord tryna sell a motherload
Whip it off the stove, gotta use another bowl
Swerve past a hater like a hole in the road
Link with the gang, don't sell your soul
Freeze my crew, I'm subzero
Fish in the dish, tryna find Nemo
Took a nine and a half, made a whole kilo
Fur like it's winter still, rain on the windowsill
Summertime drop-top, fresher than a summer hill
Candlerville, run the town, pull up where your mama live
Opp in every hood say I'm not really wanted here
Diamonds in my right ear, diamonds in my wife ear
Future say life good, yeah, it's really nice here
Niggas I don't like here, niggas wanna fight here
Touch you me, zap you with the fire, Buzz Lightyear

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Chillin' on the beach with my million-dollar freak, I let the water clean the sand out her sandals
Came a long way from trappin' out a shotgun house in Alabama, passing eagles like Randall
Red carpet shawty with a bitch like a Barbie and a tailor-made suit from Alessandro
I did a robbery, a nigga tried to buck on the pistol, I reversed it and hit him with the handle

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I done spent a couple mil' on clothes and another half a mil' on her toes and her sandals (Toes)
She was suckin' my dick behind her old man back, now that's what you call a scandal (Ah)
She like to gangbang, like the way I throw it up, now she wanna fuck a red bandana (Yeah)
Young nigga gettin' freaky with these hoes, let 'em rub my back with a goddamn candle (Swear)
Peep out the way they be glist' on the wrist, I can put this shit on without tryin' (No cap)
Look at the twinkle and glisten, it's no pretty penny, it cost me a dime (Dime)
Pimpin' 'em early, these bitches is dirty, they fuck on your mans all the time (Shit)
Too hard to snooze and lose, I'm slimy, I'm sneakin' this shit every time (Yeah)
I hit more bitches than Rocky Balboa
Black diamonds on me, they came out the sewer
She call me Prince and I'm fuckin' her raw
I know that I save her, she call me the Lord
I'm rockin' Dior and it ain't in the store
I sleep in the coupe and I'm rich as a whore
Look at my cars and play eeny-miny-moe (Pick one)
Bullets in the clip, and they long as your toe (Grrt, grrt)
Give her five racks and she suck 'til it's sore
Iguodala diamonds big as your toe
Cuban link on me thick as a rope
You told and you broke, you a rat and a roach
She not a squirter, but that pussy soaked
Mmm, it felt like we fucked on a boat
Mmm, my dick ain't no weed, but she choke
Mmm, bought her five-thousand-dollar soap

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Chillin' on the beach with my million-dollar freak, I let the water clean the sand out her sandals
Came a long way from trappin' out a shotgun house in Alabama, passing eagles like Randall
Red carpet shawty with a bitch like a Barbie and a tailor-made suit from Alessandro
I did a robbery, a nigga tried to buck on the pistol, I reversed it and hit him with the handle

[Outro]
Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci

[Intro: Young Thug]
(Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
I slowly board the jet, it was a sixteen passenger, woah

[Chorus: Young Thug]
She a very freaky girl, the best in the world
Asian and Brazil, but I caught her in Montreal
Diamonds and pearls, she say I rock her world
Mink brown like a squirrel, feed her salmon and pills

[Post-Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I woke up in St. Barts on a yacht with a thot
She want all the smoke like that time I smoked with Bart
Slob on my knob, babe, don't blow it, that's your job
Bitch gave me her heart and said, "Don't break it, that's your job"

[Refrain: Young Thug]
I just told Gucci he hot as he gon' get
I took a bowl of grits, I put it on my wrist
It's like I live in a toilet the way that I be shittin'
My niggas never bargain, we stand firm, not concerned

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane & Young Thug]
Gotta bring the crew with me, a couple hitters flew with me
My young nigga just FaceTimed me with all you niggas' jewelry
All this blue cheese on me, I'ma need some celery
Thugger, that's my evil twin, from now on, call me Jeffery
Thug and Gucci (Slatt), takin' over the industry
Thug and Gucci (Slatt), bought us Bentleys just for the B's
She lovin' on me (300), I'm lovin' this codeine (Yeah)
She suck 'til it's so clean, then left with the brodie
YSL and 1017 tied like some shoestrings
Jumped off the bridge, bungee, millions on a wedding ring
Fucked her 'til she had a stroke, now she need some therapy
We gettin' on the medicine and now I got her scared of me

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Fuckin' in the back of the car like a sofa
I don't pitty-pat, tryna kill you and your mother
I don't know about it, but I can teach 'em how to stop 'em
Red and blue diamonds, but I promise I ain't a cop car
I been in the trenches froze tryna make some
I been servin' molly all weekend
I crack your old lady like a pecan
Implants got a nigga bitin' through cement

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
If this bitch take another bean and OD, that's a felony
Tried to slow her down, but she keep mixing up the medicine
All these Rolls-Royces pullin' up, bitch, I'm the president (Go)
Had to take him off 'cause he kept callin', I wasn't ready yet
YSL and 1017, one weekend, spent a yellow 'Vette
Had to put some diamonds on her neck, that pussy very wet
Monica Lewinsky, bitch, you just sucked on the president (Wop)
Gucci Mane and Thugger, man, together, that's one heavy team

[Chorus: Young Thug]
She a very freaky girl, the best in the world
Asian and Brazil, but I caught her in Montreal
Diamonds and pearls, she say I rock her world
Mink brown like a squirrel, feed her salmon and pills

[Verse 4: Gucci Mane & Young Thug]
Stepping on these bitches' necks, it's unfair (It's unfair)
You rich and you fine and it's rare (Girl, you rare)
I'ma take my bitch to Lenox Square (Lenox Square)
You a pool table, green and you're square (And you're square)
I tell you watch your body and your deep friends (Deep friends)
Can't tell you 'bout his body, he too deep in (Let's go)
'Cause if this shit get leaked, niggas get took off the streets
Tie some tons 'round your feet, now you're swimmin' with the fish
Living like a kingpin, vacation every weekend
A demon for my semen, she love it more than breathin'
From gamblin' in Four Seasons to suites at the Venetians
For no apparent reason, she love me more than breathin'
Forgis on flat tires and extinct, park the Bentley (SEX)
I go Grinch on a freak every year (I go Grinch)
Tie my tithes with the Brinks, yeah, yeah (With the Brinks)
My artist out your tax bracket, sheesh, in one year
My artist just signed, I already got an M
So many fallen stones that you damn near can't see 'em
Underground king, I'm like Bun B and Pimp
The world is 1017, they should put it on a blimp

[Refrain: Young Thug]
I just told Gucci he hot as he gon' get

It's like I live in a toilet the way that I be shittin'
My niggas never bargain, we stand firm, not concerned

[Verse 5: Young Thug]

Skydweller on my side, bitch, but Patek her concern

[Verse 6: Young Thug]

Took a red leather coach out the house, put it in the Jag'

Them suckers them, what's up with them? I buck on them, scuff up them Timbs
Petty hustles, predators, pressure them then they crumble them
Cripple nigga, shitbag, wheelchairs, I humble them
Bullets get to flippin' and fumblin' and tumblin'
"Gucci Mane, hey let's jump him," nobody jumpin' him (No)
One man, two handguns, that's what you up against
My right arm is so-called strong, why is the muscle big?

Sippin' Act', don't do Patrón
Chain said burr, re-up, make it disappear
On that Pimp C, talkin' slurred
Pop a Perc', my vision blurry
My bitch petite
Patek Philippe
Hellcat motor in my Jeep
Talkin' bars, I charge a fee
Took an '05 banger beat
I woke up yesterday
Knowing I was lost in the past somewhere
I felt my destiny was a sad parade
Going no-o-where

When I saw my sweet melodie
Like a song, you enchanted me
And the sound of your voice
Made my heart keep time
To the music of a love that filled my mind

Melodie, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For ya only

Doo-doo-oo doo-oo dooo-doo ooo-ooo
(I wanna see you love me)
The long and winding road
Is much shorter now that you're here with me
The questions in my mind
Have been answered now that you’ve told me
All the colours are brighter now
And the darkness is lighter now
In my mind I can hear
The band start to play
Hello tomorrow
Goodbye yesterday

Melodie, you're my symphony
A love song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For ya only

Beautiful morning
Oh happy day
And you know that it’s music to my ears
Every word that you say-ay-ayyy

Melodie, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only
Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For ya only

Melodie, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only, only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For ya only

Let gets up and never stops, no

Don't let it get you down, oh no

Don't let it get you down

(Don't let it get you down)
Don't let it, let it, let it...
Don't let it get you down
(Fade out)

[Verse 1]
There goes the sunshine
Here comes the rain
And heartache pain
What can i do but wait for you?
Darling, the days I had were cold
Now our separate ways we go
It seems you want more
Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay
And you've got your life to live

[Chorus]
But if it gets too rough
Call on me

[Verse 2]
Dreams of golden glare
Taking you away from here
But if ever things that have to be
Turns your dreams around
Love and understanding is what you need

[Chorus]
If you can't get enough
Call on me

[Bridge]
I'm so sad you're leaving
It's gonna kill me not to be with you
But I want you to be happy
If heartache's what you want
Then I want it too

[Verse 3]
So goodbye with all my prayers
For your happiness in a world elsewhere

[Chorus]
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me, call on me

[Outro]
Yes, happiness waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me, call on me

Yes, happiness waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me
To make my father proud
To make my mother smile
I need not conquer worlds, or fame
Nor set the pace for style

If I can follow through
On what they gave me as my tools
I'll find a way to sail my course
Avoiding ships of fools

If I don't come up, number one
I'll stand not well apart
As one for numbered numbers
When knowing in my heart
I've done all to be done
To always do my best
By listening to me myself
So he can do the rest

(Law without compromise
Shall follow the feel of constant care)
In my eleventh hour
I'll be a man aware
To face whatever falls my way
Prepared then unashamed
To just be called a part of God
For which I have been named
A man and woman's youngest son
While growing still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smile

[Verse 1]
I don't like you but I love you
Seems that I'm always thinking of you
Oh, you treat me badly
I love you madly

[Chorus]
You really got a hold on me, come on
You really got a hold on me, yeah
I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me
Hold me, hold me, yeah

[Verse 2]
I don't want you but I need you
Don't want to kiss you but I need you
Oh, you do me wrong now
My love is strong now

[Chorus]
You really got a hold on me, come on
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me, yeah
(You really got a hold on me)
I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me
Hold me, hold me, yeah

[Verse 3]
I want to leave you, don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend another day here
Oh, I want to split now
'Cause I can't quit now

[Chorus]
You really got a hold on me, come on
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)

[Outro]
Yeah
(You really got a hold on me)
Yeah yeah
(You really got a hold on me)
You got a hold, babe
(You really got a hold on me)
You really got a hold on me
(You really got a hold on me)
Yeah
(You really got a hold on me)

[Verse 1]
If I had a penny
For every time I didn't hold your hand
If I had a nickel
For everytime I didn't understand
I'd be the world's first billionaire
'Cause you're not there
And no one ever told me
What you already knew
If I had only reached out
I might still be touching you

[Chorus]
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You've got (ha), you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you
You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you

[Verse 2]
I would get embarrased
For every time a movie made you cry
You get sentimental
And I would never know the reason why
I'd hold the world's highest record
For my selfish pride
Is it really over?
Can I get close to you?
I only want to show you
That I've learned a thing or two

[Chorus]
Touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
Girl you're so together
Together we can make it, all the way
If I had a chance to choose
Between a million bucks and you
I'd choose you babe, yeah

It's no dreams
But with proof as sweet as you, noo

Turn to you when they need more honey
Love you so much it's not funny

Girl you're so together
And together we can make it all the way, yeah
Oh, girl, you're so together
Oh, hey girl, girl, eye, eye, popper

Girl you're so together
And together we can make it all the way
Oh, I love her, I love her, I love, I love you babe
Yeah
(And together we can make it all the way)
Ooh, girl, you're so together
Don't want to discuss it
I think it's time for a change
You may get disgusted
Start thinkin' that I'm strange
In that case I'll go underground
Get some heavy rest
Never have to worry
About what is worst and what is best (get it)
Oh oh Domino (all right)
Roll me over Romeo
There you go
Lord have mercy
I said oh oh Domino
Roll me over Romeo
There you go
Say it again
I said oh oh Domino
I said oh oh Domino, dig it
There's no need for argument
There's no argument at all
And if you never hear from him
That just means he didn't call or vice versa
That depends on wherever you're at
Or and if you never hear from me
That just means I would rather not
Oh oh Domino
Roll me over Romeo
There you go
Lord have mercy
I said oh oh Domino
Roll me over Romeo
There you go
Say it again
Oh oh Domino
I said oh oh Domino

Yeah, okay
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I'm on yo' head
Yeah, I'm on yo' head
Okay, I'm on yo' head
I'm on yo'— (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Okay, I'm on yo' head like a bookie when you overdue
Been dead, I just wrote the tune
I'm CNN to the local news
See, what I do inside this vocal booth
Can only be described as a screw when it's goin' loose
I know the truth is only spoken to a chosen few
Know the rules get broken like a bone when I get hold of you
So don't you move
Hotel room of hoes come with ocean views
Heaven here below the roof
Heaven here below the roof
She lick the liquor off me
It's a hobby tryna keep all of these bitches off me
When they really want me, and the
Dick is godly, stick is Crosby
It isn't hockey, but this game is cold as veins that flow within a zombie
Bless you when I'm in your body
The main event on every television set, so don't forget to watch me
Became rich, I ain't been the same since
Now my whip speak a different language, and it's always talkin'

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Choo Jackson]
I'm no angel, no wings, no halo
I got vices too
Woah, woah, woah, woah
I get fed up and I get fucked up
Said, I got vices too
Woah, woah, woah, woah

[Post-Chorus: Choo Jackson]
Jameson and ginger ale, please
I'm stressin', gotta get this cheese

[?]
Jameson and ginger ale, please
Jameson and ginger ale, please
(Bartender! Bartender!)
Jameson and ginger ale, please

[Verse 2: Choo Jackson]
I know I'm hard to handle
Lookin' for me, find me at the bottom of a barrel
Yeah, work some other cheap skirts like old Camaro
Lookin' like a pharaoh
Can't find the actavis, these niggas sippin' yellow
I thought I always had to drink to try to fight depression
Now I go and spend the bank up on a normal necklace
Now I'm jumpin' in these bitches just to ease the pressure
I always keep the golden glover, that my lethal weapon
I always had the crazy visions of the foreign vessels
Stressed out, pop a blood vessel
Took off like a skud missile
Listen, man, I always been in rule since middle school
Gotta stay fucked up, that's the golden rule
Ain't too much to prove
They wanna drink the juice, so they gotta squeeze the prune
Got bills while I'm lookin' for a freak
God, I'll deal with that shit next week, next week

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Choo Jackson]
I'm no angel, no wings, no halo
I got vices too
Woah, woah, woah, woah
I get fed up and I get fucked up
Said, I got vices too
Woah, woah, woah, woah

[Verse 1]
Twenty five miles from home, girl
My feet are hurtin' mighty bad
Now I’ve been walkin' for three days
And two lonely nights you know that I'm mighty bad
But I got a girl waitin’ for me
That's gonna make this trip worthwhile
You see, she's got the kind
Of lovin' and kissin' make a boy go stone wild

[Chorus]
I got to keep on walkin'
Oh, I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y'all I'm so tired
But I just can’t lose my stride

[Verse 2]
I got fifteen miles to go now
And I can hear my baby callin’ my name
It's as if, as though I’m standin' at her front door
And I can hear that doggone thing
Now I'll be so glad to see my baby
And hold her in my arms one more time
And when I kiss her lips I turn backward flip
And I forget about these feet of mine

[Chorus]
I got to keep on walkin'
Oh, I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y’all I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride

I got to keep on walkin', Aaah!
Yeah, I got to walk on let me tell you
Y'all hope my feet don't fail me now
I got five more miles to go
I got nine, eight, seven, six, oh six

[Verse 3]
I got five more miles to go now
Over the hills just around the bend
Although my feet are tired, I can't lose my stride
I got to get my baby back again

[Chorus]
I got to keep on walkin', Aaah!
I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y'all I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride
Oh, I got to walk on, Aaah!
Let me tell you, y'all I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride
I got to keep on walkin', Aaah!
I got to walk on

[Verse 1]
All along I had to talk about it
But like a two-edged sword
It cuts you and it stabs me
All along I knew you were a phony girl
You sit behind the mask
And you control your world
You sit around and I watch your face
I try to find the truth
But that's your hiding place
You say you love me but it's hard to see
Cause' when he's in your arms
You're throwing rocks at me!

[Chorus 1]
Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know
Who do you love?
I don't want you
If you can't answer
You know me

[Chorus 2]
(There is nothing in your eyes)
There is nothing in your eyes
(But that's the way you cry, girl)
But that's the way you cry, girl
(All is grand, all is bright)
All is grand, all is bright
(You're just studying my mind)
Eh-eh-eh

[Verse 2]
I walk around, I’m suffering in my doom
When I come to you
You're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask
So I can see your face!

[Chorus 1]
Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know
Who do you love, babe?
I don't want you
If you can't answer
I know you
Hoo!

[Chorus 3]
(Heaven must be wary)
Heaven must be wary
(Your smile is scary)
You got me scared, girl
(All is grand, all is bright)
Every year, yours are good
(Where's your soul? Where'd it go?)
You got me scared, girl

(Heaven must be wary)
Heaven must be wary
(Your smile is scary)
You know where you've been
(All is grand, all is bright)
Every year, na na na
(Where's your soul? Where did it go?)

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
I walk around, I’m suffering in my doom
And when I come to you
You're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask
So I can see your face!

[Chorus 1]
Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don’t know
Who do you love, babe?
I don't want you
If you can't answer
I know you!

[Intro]
Come on, come on, come on

[Verse 1]
I see you standing in your wolf T-shirt
I said to God "Make this man take away the hurt"
You smile, you say "Baby, don't you know
There's a reason God made you so beautiful"

[Pre-Chorus]
Denim on denim, blue on blue
Have I ever told you, "I love you"
But I do, sugar, I do, I do, I do

[Chorus]
But I don't know how to grow
You're so cool, babe
You're so cool, babe
You're so cool cool cool
And you, yeah you love me
Can you help me

[Verse 2]
Baby what I like about you, you, you
Is your nails that you wear to Timbuktu
With American flags on each little finger
Didn't make my eyes stray and linger

[Verse 1]
The birds they sang
At the break of day
Start again
I heard them say
Don't dwell on what
Has passed away
Or what is yet to be

[Verse 2]
Ah, the wars they will
Be fought again
The holy dove
She will be caught again
Bought and sold
And bought again
The dove is never free

[Chorus]
Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in

[Verse 3]
We asked for signs
The signs were sent:
The birth betrayed
The marriage spent
Yeah the widowhood
Of every government
Signs for all to see

[Verse 4]
I can't run no more
With that lawless crowd
While the killers in high places
Say their prayers out loud (Ah, fuck -)
But they've summoned, they've summoned up
A thundercloud
And they're going to hear from me

[Chorus]
Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in

[Verse 5]
You can add up the parts
But you won't have the sum
You can strike up the march
There is no drum
Every heart, every heart
To love will come
But like a refugee

[Chorus]
Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in
Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in

[Verse 1]
Trouble, oh, trouble, set me free
I have seen your face
And it’s too much too much for me
Trouble, oh, trouble, can’t you see?
You’re eating my heart away
And there’s nothing much left of me

[Chorus]
I’ve drank your wine
You have made your world mine
So won’t you be fair
So won’t you be fair
I don’t want more of you
So won’t you be kind to me
Just let me go where
I’ll have to go there

[Verse 2]
Trouble, oh, trouble, move away
I have seen your face
And it’s too much for me today
Trouble, oh, trouble, can’t you see?
You have made me a wreck
Now won’t you leave me in my misery

[Chorus]
I’ve seen your eyes
And I can see death’s disguise
Hangin’ on me
Hangin’ on me
I’m beat, I’m torn
Shattered and tossed and worn
Too shocking to see
Too shocking to see

[Outro]
Trouble, oh, trouble, move from me
I have paid my debt
Now won’t you leave me in my misery
Trouble, oh, trouble, please be kind
I don’t want no fight
And I haven’t got a lot of time

[Verse 1]
I lit a thin green candle to make you jealous of me
Then the room just filled up with mosquitos
Then they heard that my body was free
Then I took the dust of a long sleepless night
And I put it in your little shoe
And then I confess that I tortured the dress
That you wore for the world to look through

[Verse 2]
I showed my heart to the doctor
He said I just have to quit
Then he wrote himself a perscription
And your name was mentioned in it
Then he locked himself in a library shelf
With the details of our honeymoon
Now I hear from the nurse he's doing much worse
And his practice is all in a ruin

[Verse 3]
I heard of a saint who had loved you
So I studied all night in his school
He taught that the duty of lovers
Is to tarnish the golden rule
And just when I was sure that his teachings were pure
He drowned himself in the pool
His body is gone but back here on the lawn
His spirit continues to drool

[Verse 4]
An Eskimo showed me a movie
He'd recently taken of you
The poor man could barely stop shivering
His lips and his fingers were blue
I suppose that he froze when the wind took your clothes
And I guess he just never got warm
But you stand there so nice, in your blizzard of ice
Oh please let me back into your storm
Please

[Chorus: Laura Les & Devi McCallion]
I make my money on my own, yeah (Yeah)
Wakin' up five in the morning, yeah (Yeah)
Throwin' money in the oven, yeah (Yeah)
Fuck sleep and his cousin, yeah (Yeah)

Get off of me, I swear I'll do it all
Do it all, do it all
I can swear I can do it all
Do it all, do it all
I can swear I can do it all
(Goddamn, what the fuck, what the fuck?)

[Verse 1: Laura Les]
I'm done trying to plan
Do what I want, don't hold my hand
I can do anything I want, first try
You take like ten tries, hurtin' my eyes

[Verse 2: Dylan Brady with Devi McCallion]
Batshit, got a check and I spent it
Money got me feelin' like a dentist
I can do anything I put my mind to
You can't do anything even if you wanted to

[Chorus: Laura Les, Devi McCallion]
I make my money on my own, yeah (Yeah)
Wakin' up five in the morning, yeah (Yeah)
Throwin' money in the oven, yeah (Yeah)

Feel like I'm not good enough
Get off of me, I swear I'll do it all
Goddamn, what the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck?

[Bridge: Laura Les]
Wakin' up five in the morning, yeah
Fuck sleep and his cousin, yeah
Make my money on my own, yeah
Spend my money like it's stolen, yeah
Shit, I'm already broke and it's only 7:45 in the morning, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Dylan Brady & Devi McCallion]
Goddamn, what the fuck?
What the fuck, what the fuck?
Goddamn, what the fuck?
What the fuck?
Goddamn, what the fuck
What the fuck, what the—
What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck?

[Outro: Devi McCallion, Dylan Brady]
Watch out (I can do anything I put my mind to)
Watch out, watch out (I can do anything I put my mind to)
Watch out, watch out
Watch out, watch out
Watch out (I can do anything I put my mind to)
Watch out (I can do, I can, I can, I can)
Watch out
Watch out

[Intro: Laura Les]
I'm 'bout to hit the boof
Smokin' something new
I'm 'bout to hit the boof
Smokin' something new
(Back once again)

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady]
Ro-ro-roll the boof, then I smoke, then it's all gone
Hit that G so hard that I fall off
Taking shots in the dark, that's a bad call
Going straight for your head, gotta saw it off
I got a bag on the way
Smokin' a zip in a day
What were you trying to say?
Making it up on the way

[Bridge: Laura Les]
I never say what I need when I need you
Never say what I need when I need you
I'm good on the weed, but I need you
I might hit the weed, I might hit the boof

[Verse 2: Laura Les]
I'm addicted to Monster, money, and weed, yeah
I'm blowin' clouds so loud, you can't fuckin' see, yeah
I'm addicted to everything that I see, yeah
I’m addicted to making money off me, yeah
I might go and throw my phone into the lake, yeah
It ain't hard to quit caring what you think, yeah
Burnt me one too many times like a tree, yeah
Now there's fire raining down on your screams, yeah

[Intro: umru]
Hello?
(Umru said I'm cute)

[Chorus: Laura Les]
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I answer

[Verse 1: Laura Les]
Twenty-seven missed calls lightin' up my cell phone
Sending you a text sayin', "Call you when I get home"
Taking off my work clothes, workin' in a cold one
Forty-five group texts, fifty group DMs
Send another text askin' me if I've seen them
Pushin' back a deadline, gotta make my bedtime
Then I crack a smile 'cause I love you and I'd do it all again

[Chorus: Laura Les]
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I answer

[Bridge: Laura Les]
Something's gotta work this time
It's my way of trying to let you know
I've got a little thing for you
I've got a little crush or somethin'
Maybe I'm just drunk as fuck
I customize my ringtone
But it's always you
It's always you
It's always you
It's always you
It's always you

[Verse 2: Dylan Brady]
It was always you
Put it on vibrate when I'm with you (With you)
Talkin' to myself again (Again)
Falling on broken glass
Twenty-nine missed calls, never leave the basement
I don't wanna tell you what I'm really thinking
Thinking, what I'm really thinking

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse]
I'm in New York and you're in Long Island
I don't even treat you that good, girl, why you smilin'?
It's three in the mornin', why are you drivin'?
Why you stoppin' for gas to get on the highway, just to end up in my place?

[Verse 1: N0THANKY0U]
I was tryin' to find a way to kill time
I didn't even get to tell you goodbye
I was tryin' to find a way to kill time
Now you're gone and I can't ever say goodbye
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room
I couldn't go another day
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room
I couldn't go, go, go, go

[Chorus: N0THANKY0U]
Oh my god, what the fuck?
Take my hand, crush it up
Spill the blood on the floor
I ain't scared, think there's more
What the fuck? Make it stop
Took too long, here right now
On the floor, in the car
Smoking cigs in the bar
I don't want you to think
I got bad intentions
Never wanted you inside
You made it your mission, yeah
Didn't wanna hurt no one
But you just went and made it fun, fun, fun, fun

[Verse 2: N0THANKY0U]
I hear you're lookin' for a way to fight the Corpus bride
She's workin' in my mind
And you're lookin' for a way to crush, it's not enough
You fucked up your last try
We were in the studio, I was just playin'
You were all work and I was all play and
You were talkin' business, aiming with your weapon
I was on your hit list, I felt the compression

[Bridge: N0THANKY0U]
I'll never go, I'll haunt your studio
You won't think of words when you write at all
You'll just hear me singing this song
You'll think that's okay, you'll just sing along
You just copy everything we do
If I wasn't me, I'd copy me too
You just copy everything we do
If I wasn't me, I'd copy me too

[Chorus: N0THANKY0U]
Oh my god, what the fuck?
Take my hand, crush it up
Spill the blood on the floor
I ain't scared, think there's more
What the fuck? Make it stop
Took too long, here right now
On the floor, in the car
Smoking cigs in the bar
I don't want you to think
I got bad intentions
Never wanted you inside
You made it your mission, yeah
Didn't wanna hurt no one
But you just went and made it fun, fun, fun, fun

[Outro: N0THANKY0U]
I hear you're lookin' for a way to fight the Corpus bride
She's workin' in my mind
And you're lookin' for a way to crush, it's not enough
You fucked up your last try
We were in the studio, I was just playin'
You were all work and I was all play and
You were talkin' business, aiming with your weapon
I was on your hit list, I felt the compression

[Verse 1: Patrick Stump & Craig Owens]
I was dying to find a way to kill time
I didn't even get to tell you goodbye
I was dying to find a way to kill time (A way to kill time)
Now you're gone and I can't ever say goodbye
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room
I couldn't go another day
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room
I couldn't go, go, go, go

[Chorus: Nicole Dollanganger]
Oh my god, what the fuck?
Take my hand, crush it up
Spill the blood on the floor
I ain't scared, think there's more
What the fuck? Make it stop
Took too long, here right now
On the floor, in the air
Smoking cigs in the bar
I don't want you to think
I got bad intentions
Never wanted you inside
You made it your mission, yeah
Didn't wanna hurt no one
But you just went and made it fun

[Verse 2: Craig Owens]
I hear you're lookin' for a way to fight the Corpus bride
She's workin' in my mind
And you're lookin' for a way to crush
It's not enough
You fucked up your last try
We were in the studio, I was just playin'
You were all work and I was all play and
You were talkin' business, aiming with your weapon
I was on your hit list, I felt the compression

[Verse 3: Craig Owens]
I'll never go, I'll haunt your studio
You won't think of words when you write at all
You'll just hear me singing this song
You'll think that's okay, you'll just sing along
You just copy everything we do
If I wasn't me, I'd copy me too
You just copy everything we do
If I wasn't me, I'd copy me too

[Outro: Craig Owens]
I'd copy me too, copy me too
Copy me too, copy me
I'd copy me too, copy me too
Copy me too, copy me too
I'd copy me too, copy me too
Copy me too, copy me too
I'd copy me too
I'd copy me too
I'd copy me too
I'd copy me too
I'd copy me too

[Verse 1]
Who's gonna tell you when
It's too late?
Who's gonna tell you things
Aren't so great?

[Chorus]
You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong, oh no
Who's gonna drive you home
Tonight?

[Verse 2]
Who's gonna pick you up
When you fall?
Who's gonna hang it up
When you call?
Who's gonna pay attention
To your dreams?
Who's gonna plug their ears
When you scream?

[Chorus]
You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong, oh no
Who's gonna drive you home
Tonight?

[Verse 3]
Who's gonna hold you down
When you shake?
Who's gonna come around
When you break?

[Chorus]
You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong, oh no
You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong
Who's gonna drive you home
Tonight?

[Chorus]
Hey, I've been falling apart these days
Split open, watching my heart go
'Round and around, 'round and around
Circle the drain, I'm going down

[Verse 1]
I wanna be calm like the soft
Summer rain on your back
Like the fall of your shoulders
But everything just brings me back down
To the cold hard ground
And it keeps getting colder
It's a feeling that boils in my brain
I would dial back the flame
But I'm not sure I'm able
I'm wobbling out on the wire
And the lights could go out
With the break of a cable

[Pre-Chorus]
Things feel that low sometimes
Even when everything is fine

[Chorus]
Hey, I've been falling apart these days
Split open, watching my heart go
'Round and around, 'round and around
Circle the drain, I'm going down
('Round and around and around and around
'Round and around and around and around)

[Verse 2]
I'm trying to seem strong for my love
For my family and friends
But I'm so tired of faking
'Cause I'm chained to my bed when they're gone
Watching TV alone
'Til my body starts aching
And I think there's a mold in my brain
Spreading down all the way
Through my heart and my body
'Cause I cling to the dark of my room
And the days thin me out
Or just burn me straight through

[Pre-Chorus]
Things feel that low sometimes
Even when everything is fine

[Chorus]
Hey, I've been falling apart these days
Split open, watching my heart go
'Round and around, 'round and around
Circle the drain, I'm going down
('Round and around and around and around
'Round and around and around and around)

[Bridge]
Things feel that low sometimes
Even when everything is fine

[Chorus]
Hey, I've been falling apart these days
Split open, watching my heart go
'Round and around, 'round and around
Circle the drain, I'm going down
You were there before we came
You took the hurt, you took the shame
They built the walls to block your way
You beat them down, you won the day
It wasn't right, it wasn't fair
You taught them all, you made them care
Yes, you were there, and thanks to you
There's now a door we all walk through
And we are here, for all to see...
To be the best that we can be
Yes, I am here...
Because you were there

[Verse 1]
She's from a world
Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing
I'm from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd

[Chorus]
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away

[Bridge]
Two different people
In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear the calliope
And I can hear her calling me

[Chorus]
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away

[Outro]
I say
Rollin' around
Sitting on dubs
Can't lie, was high on shrubs
Coolin' in my Escalade

Man, I'm paid, I got it made
Take me to your special place
Close your eyes
Show me your face
I'm gonna piss on it!

[Chorus]
Haters wanna hate
Lovers wanna love
I don't even want, none of the above
I want to piss on you!

Piss I do
I'll piss on you
I'll pee on you

[Verse 2]
Set your body
Your body
It's a puddle party
And the pee I kick

Like an oldschool party
I'mma pee on you
Drip, drip, drip
Pee on u
Love on you
Piss on you, piss on you!

[Verse 3]
The love I feel
Quite the same
When you get a bit
Of my Hershey's stains

I will poop on you too
I want to pee in your food
Only thing to make my life complete
When I turn your face into a toilet seat
I want to pee on you!

Yes I do, yes I do
I'll piss on you
I'll pee on you

[Chorus]
Haters wanna hate
Lovers wanna love
I don't even want, none of the above
I want to piss on you!

Piss I do
I'll piss on you
I'll pee on you

[Outro]
Won't you braid my hair
See, won't you braid my hair
Before you snap
I'm gonna fall
I'm gonna fall on you
Now that I do this
But I will piss y'all off with a little taste of the remix
Ya ready?
Here we go

[Verse 1]
I pick you up from the club
Take you home sweet love
Got a surprise, close your eyes
I wanna cover you with sum..

[Chorus]
I'mma give you some poo poo
I'mma give you some pee pee
I'mma give you some doo doo
And wash you now with some wee wee

[Outro]
This is the remix edition
Of my song about pissing
I got that pee, that you can drinkin'
And it's juicy from the kitchen
Yeah, that's how goes at the R. Kelly party
I sip chris, you drink piss
Piss on You remix
And I'm serious
I really do wanna piss on you

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Might not, feel your, face

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
You might not feel your face, but you always feel the high
And nothing last forever, said these, voices in my mind
Are we all just afraid, do they notice the change?
You see out the weather, still carry umbrellas
Always be scared of the rain
And I'm still terrified of ending the pain
We live with these beautiful colors
Don't notice the shades of gray
You start to feel strange, how it cooks your brain
You wander around for no reason, can't even remember your name
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I need a little sweet, sweet amnesia
A sweet, sweet amnesia, yeah
I need a sweet amnesia, yeah
A little sweet amnesia, yeah
A sweet, sweet amnesia
A sweet, sweet amnesia
Oh, how I need ya
Yeah, amnesia, yeah

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Marlboro Red in grandmother purse
Whatever help to speed up the hearse
We livin' in hell
Lead in the shells, they lead by example
People, they ask you shoot for the stars
But all that we seen is shootin' from cars
Is shootin' the norms, they shotgunnin' beer
Wet on your eyes, suppressin' the tears
Lies you told over years, aimed at the ones that you loved
Lookin' for Heaven above you, put on a front from hope that it's real
Still young and blinded by the street lights
Hate make it hard for you to sleep tight
Do we live and die to fuckin' ease by?
In the belly of the beast, still the meek thrive
Headin' out, we run from red dots
Seem the best bet is death at young age
Least then you get the front page
Then again the love is still fake

[Chorus]
This is a funny game, why don't you do the same?
This is a funny game, why don't you try it yourself?
This is a funny game, why don't you do the same?
This is a funny game

[Verse 1]
If I was an animal, I'd be a lion
If I was a car, Id be an Aston martin
If I was a genius, I'd be Isaac Newton
If I was a hero, I'd be Martin Luther

[Chorus]
This is a funny game, why don't you do the same?
This is a funny game, why don't you try it yourself?
This is a funny game, why don't you do the same?
This is a funny game

[Verse 2]
If I was an actor, I'd be Marlon Brando
If I was a painter, I'd be Frida Kahlo
If I was a drink, I'd be a lemon drop
If I was a song, I would be super pop

[Chorus]
This is a funny game, why don't you do the same?
This is a funny game, why don't you try it yourself?
This is a funny game, why don't you do the same?
This is a funny game

[Verse 3]
If I was a star, I would be who I am today
If I was a fighter, I'd be Cassius Clay
If I was emotion, I would be intense
If I was a man, I would be president

[Bridge]
Ask me a question, I'll do the same
Give me your answer, it's all a funny game

[Verse 4]
If I was an animal, I'd be a man
If I was a man, I'd be the president
If I was the president, I'd be a hero
If I was a hero, I'd be super pop

[Chorus]
This is a funny game, why don't you do the same?
This is a funny game, why don't you try it yourself?
This is a funny game, why don't you do the same?
This is a funny game, why don't you try it yourself?
Welcome back lust
Free melly
Rip my pet lizard
This song is dedicated to a special person
Welcome back (ye, ye)

Heart's been broken so many times
I dont know what to believe (i dont)
Momma said its my fault, its my fault
I wear my heart on my sleeve (i'm crying right now)
Mumble
I can't breath
Mumble

While on a cell with lil melly
I slap him after i told him
I dont wanna go down with these clowns
On my soldier (fact) no one caught us in
Mumble aggression, they were snitchin
Never had no confession
See, i done, been lied, back stab, heart broken
I wanted to cry but i was too afraid to open
Praying one day i found peace, sitting mind in the ocean
I spent all these time commiting crimes, getting closer
Turnin at the ceiling, tryin to find my feelings, thinkin way i can get us millions
Remember the days we got rainy days

SIKE nigga i'm not emo, so i'll shoot you in the head.. yeah (nigga we emo cap)
I'll booty rape you and tie you to the bed (i'll cum on you)
I'll bash your head, i dont even care if it bleeds red (smack you)
Inject you with my semen like its led (coool) yuh yuh
I'll squash a nigga who test you like he a lime
I'm black so you know I did my time
I steal nickels, quarters, pennies, nickel, dime
I'm a black nigga so you know i do crime
(i'm in jail)

[Verse 1]
Where you goin'? Why you leavin'? The fuck is up?
I feel your soul here with me, but your body's gone
When I'm alone, I feel you near, I feel you close
It feels so wrong, it's been some years, still I don't know
Where you went, and who, what, and
When I close my eyes, I see somethin' I don't like
Wake up and I still hate what I've become
I can't believe my eyes
Blacked out drunk, I'm numb, I'm dumb high

[Pre-Chorus]
Seems like nothing has changed like I said it would
I know I said that I'd change but I never could

[Chorus]
I'm still lonely and fucked up
And I'ma be this way right here 'til my luck's up
I've never been the same ever since I lost one
All that I ever wanted was to be just loved, oh, oh
I'm still lonely and fucked up
And I'm realizing now that I need your love
Shadows over my heart, got nobody to trust
All that I ever wanted was to be just loved, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I never thought that I'd be here (Oh-oh), and still feel lost
It don't feel right without you here (It don't), I need your love
Thought I was good, but I was wrong (I thought)
Drownin' my thoughts in Hennessy, prayin' to God
Askin' myself, "Where'd I go wrong?"
I tried but I can't find
I said I'm fine, I lied
I know that I was wrong and it hurts to know you were right

[Pre-Chorus]
Seems like nothing has changed like I said it would (Oh, no)
I know I said that I'd change but I never could

[Chorus]
I'm still lonely and fucked up (Oh, yeah)
And I'ma be this way right here 'til my luck's up
I've never been the same ever since I lost one (Ooh)
All that I ever wanted was to be just loved, oh, oh
I'm still lonely and fucked up
And I'm realizing now that I need your love
Shadows over my heart, got nobody to trust
All that I ever wanted was to be just loved, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Boy, you lied to me, and I felt the pain
You didn't do it once, you did it every day
Don't explain yourself 'cause talk is cheap
There's more important things to do than hear you speak
I've listened to your lies and all your stories
(I've listened to your stories)
Lonely days are gone, I'm finally moving on
I don't wanna hear those words again

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know

[Verse 2]
You're not half the man that you think you are
Don't say another word because you've gone too far
I was good to you, but I didn't know
You never felt the same, now you have to go
You stayed because I made it so convenient
(I made it so convenient)
I wasted all my tears, I hope I made it clear
I don't wanna hear those words again

How you gon' say I'm different
How you gon' say I'm distant
I swear I was down when them bitches wasn't 'round
And them niggas that was hollerin' was dissin'
I thought I was down when them smiles they was frowns
And them niggas they was all in your business
You know every game from a nigga
Had this thing for you, ever since a child I've been with this
Tell you be the witness

[Chorus]
I gave you all and you wanted more
Gave you all and you wanted more
All and you wanted more
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
All and you wanted more
All and you wanted more

[Verse 1]
I don't like cities, but I like New York
Other places make me feel like a dork
Los Angeles is for people who sleep
Paris and London, baby, you can keep

[Chorus]
'Cause I, love New York
I, I love New York
I love New York
I love New York
I love New York
I love New York

[Verse 2]
If you don't like my attitude, then you can F off
Just go to Texas, isn't that where they golf?
New York is not for little pussies who scream
If you can't stand the heat, then get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street

[Chorus]
I love New York

No other city ever made me glad except New York

There's only so much you can learn in one place
The more that I wait, the more time that I waste

[Verse 1]
I haven't got much time to waste, It's time to make my way
I'm not afraid of what I'll face, but I'm afraid to stay
I'm going down my own road and I can make it alone
I'll work and I'll fight till I find a place of my own

[Chorus]
Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hands
Get ready to jump

[Verse 2]
We learned our lesson from the start, my sisters and me
The only thing you can depend on is your family
Life's gonna drop you down like the limbs of a tree
It sways and it swings and it bends until it makes you see

Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hands
Get ready to, are you ready?

[Breakdown]
I can make it alone
I can make it alone
I can make it alone (My sisters and me, my sisters and me)
I can make it alone

Get ready to, are you ready?

[Verse 1]
You push me, to go the extra mile
You push me, when it's difficult to smile
You push me, a better version of myself
You push me, only you and no one else
You push me, to see the other point of view
You push me, when there's nothing else to do
You push me, when I think I know it all
You push me, when I stumble and I fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep on pushing like nobody

[Chorus]
Every step I take
Every move I make
Every thing I do
I owe it all to you
Every race, I win
Every mood I'm in
Everything I love
It's all because you push me

[Verse 2]
You push me, when I don't appreciate
You push me, not to lie and not to hate
You push me, when I want it all to end
You push me, when I really need a friend
You push me, all I wanna do is cry
You push me, when it's hard for me to try
You push me, when I do it for myself
You push me, only you and no one else

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep on pushing like nobody

Every step I take (To go the extra mile)
Every move I make (When it's difficult to smile)

You've been hit by a smooth criminal
A bad girl, I gotcha crying to your mumma

Caught up in the law right
I think I'm in love and I

[Verse 1]
Is it the rain or is it the weather?
Am I insane to wanna keep it together?
Is it the moon that's affecting my brain?
Is it my prayers that never made it to heaven?

[Chorus]
I'm in love with love
Anyone can see
Angels up above are watching over me

[Verse 2]
Is it the sunlight that changes the seasons?
Monday through Sunday, I am looking for reasons
Is there an angel watching over my shoulder?
Tricking my senses or giving me shelter

[Chorus]
I'm in love with love
Anyone can see
Angels up above are watching over me
I'm in love with love (Is it the rain? Is it the weather?)
Angels up above (Is it my prayers keeping us together?)

Is it the rain or is it the weather?
Am I insane to wanna keep it together?

Anyone can see
Angels up above are watching over me

Angels up above (Is it my prayers keeping us together?)

If I was a star, I would be who I am today
If I was a fighter, I'd be Cassius Clay
If I was emotion, I would be intense
If I was a man, I would be president

[Bridge]
I'll be different
If I'm the president
I'll be different
If I'm the president

Got my hair cut today feeling shy
Thinking of how you’d say looks alright
Dreamt about you again woke up tired
Lucky to see my friends’ kitchen tile
Cut a little short
Verse:
I want you to fall into my arms
I'll be who you're depending on
When you're most vulnerable

I can see the future in your eyes
They're telling me everything's gon be just fine
Everything gon be alright

Hook:
I feel like everything's better with you

Sun shines more when I'm together with you
Wanna get lost in forever
Baby, Everything's better with you

Even when my skies go gray
And nothing seems to go my way
I always find happiness in you
Hey
God finally answered my prayers
Lending me one of his angels
You're a blessing if I've ever seen one

Elephant in the room
Keeping me in the loop
Holding us stuck like glue
Reading but it don't make sense
Rub my eyes out looking again
Guess I gotta start telling all them about

Asking u how it’s going but I know
We could pass time along but it won’t
Trying fill space that's left now he’s gone
Sinking into my chest

Silently on the phone
Separately here alone
Asking what i don’t know
Shouldn’t have let it fade
Probably shouldn’t have moved away
Never calling up just to say hello
Finally excused of outings
Finally an excuse
Never gotta feel crowded
But never feeling loose
What am I gonna do about it
What am I gonna do
Write a little hook about it
Write a little hook

Something that I’m used to
Something that I used to do
Nothing that I wouldn’t do
Nothing that I wouldn’t do

Feeling short of breath a moment
Trying make due
Probably shoulda talked it over
Another day or two
What am I gonna do about it
What am I gonna do
Sitting in my room I'm pouting
Sitting in my room

[Verse 1]
Father comes home from work, and he's scared to death
Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table, he says "What's going on?"
Mother cries desperately, "Our little baby's gone!"

[Chorus]
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

[Verse 2]
She wrote that she is tired of step daddy using her
Saying that he'll buy 'er things, while sexually abusin' 'er
Just think that she's all alone somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive? She ain't got nothin' to eat

[Chorus]
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock (yeah)
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

[Bridge]
Save me (from this living hell)
Save me (cause I, I wanna help)
Save me (I'm tired and I'm mad)
Save me (cause this, it ain't no joke)
Save me (cause I'm out for blood)
Save me (cause I don't wanna ignore)
Save me (it's time I replied)
Save me
Ooh!

[Verse 3]
Now she's on the move, she's off ta Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, a man is waiting there
"I'll show you where the money is, girl just let down your hair"
He is takin' her on the streets, of Sunset Boulevard
She's sellin' her body, hah, girl that will take you far
The police come 'round the corner, somebody there told
He's arresting this little girl, she's only 12 years old

[Chorus]
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?

Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock

[Intro]
Why.. oooh
I

[Verse 1]
I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I so I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me

[Chorus 1]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can
(she was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone
(she was wantin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
(she was lovin' me)
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah

[Verse 2]
I never would have thought
She was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
And when I held her near
She would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me
This girl she had to be
An angel sent from Heaven just for me

[Chorus 2]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can
(she's lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone
(look who's lovin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
(she's lovin' me)
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me yeah
(look who's lovin' me)

She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me while she was still your wife
(she's wantin' me)
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school
(she was lovin' me)
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can
(she was wantin' me)
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she had a family, family, yeah
Why.. oooh ooooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I’m in love

[Verse 3]
I didn’t know she was already spoken for
‘Cause I’m not that kind of man
I swear that I would've never looked her way
Now I feel so much shame
And all things have to change
You should know that
I’m holdin' her to blame

[Chorus 2]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can
(holdin' her to blame)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone
(holdin' her to blame)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
(Holding her to blame)
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah
(holdin' her to blame)
She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me while she was still your wife
(holding her to blame)
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she had a family, family, yeah

Family, family, yeah
Ah I feel a pounding in my brain
Ice-cold water runnin' through my pain
Got a bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart feel sad 'cause Love's Gone Bad

I see a rainbow all in black
Must be a sign you ain't comin' back
Wake up at night callin' your name
I see a face on my window pane
I've been this way since you've been gone
Without your love, I can't go on
Look in the mirror, what do I see?
A cryin' face, kinda looks like me
Now where's the love you promised me?
Where's the tenderness to comfort me?

Everytime some love I choose
I seem to always be the one to lose
Bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart feels sad 'cause Love's Gone Bad
Love's Gone Bad, heart feels sad
Ooh, Black cruel signing up above
It's a sign I live my life without love
Signs on the man, slime's on the sea
Signs everywhere I said I'm destined to be
And if the world baby nothing's right
Since you've been gone baby
Can't sleep at night
You said you'd be true to me
Instead you made a fool of me
Heart feel sad, Love's Gone Bad

Ouw…

Auw, Love's Gone Bad
Heart feel sad
Love's gone Bad
Heart feel sad
Auw!! Ouw…

Ooh, Love's Gone Bad
Heart feel sad
Love's Gone Bad
Love's Gone Bad
Auw!!
Love's Gone Bad
Love's Gone Bad
Come on!!!

[Verse 1]
Oh, I didn't mean to fall in deep, but I’ve no regrets
You tried to push me down, you tried to keep me possessed
I gave you my heart, you took the key
But now I paid my debt, it's time I left

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't need someone who makes me feel so bad
And I’ve just enough left to help me pack my bags
Yes, I have found something I thought I lost
I found me, I found faith, I found trust

[Chorus]
You can't take this from me
Can't you see I won't take this lying down?
And I can hear you when you speak your poison
Bitter words can't hurt me now
I won't take it lying down

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2]
All it takes is one bold move to change everything
All it takes is loving you to forget, forgive
But I'm having some kind of breakthrough
I'm ready to live

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t need someone who makes me feel so bad
And I’ve just enough left to help me pack my bags
Yes, I have found something I thought I lost
I found me, I found faith, I found trust

[Chorus]
You can't take this from me
Can’t you see I won't take this lying down?
And I can hear you when you speak your poison
Bitter words can't hurt me now
I won't take it lying down

[Refrain]
I won’t take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down

You can't take this from me
Can't you see I won't take this lying down?
And I can hear you when you speak your poison
Bitter words can't hurt me now
I won't take it lying down

[Refrain]
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down

Compensatin' for your feelings
And you know the feelin'
This is what you thought would heal it

Times, they come and go like spirits (You good, T-Minus?)
I see these signs the clearest

[Verse 1: Aminé]
And you, and you, and you know why (Yuh)
You've been fuckin' with me since I was a small fry (True)

And you know I'ma always wish you the best (True)
Look, bitch, roll inside the Benz (Yeah)

It's hard to admit that I've made my bed (Uh-huh)
But you know I'ma always wish you the best (Limbo)

[Chorus: Aminé]
Compensatin' for your feelings

[Verse 2: Young Thug & Aminé]
Bad, baby, from the back, baby (Let's go)
I hope her heart experiencing the crash, baby
I toast it up and pour it out the glass, baby (Pour)
I tripled up, I doubled up, I ranned it up, that fucked it up
The black and orange Aventador like Daffy Duck (Skrrt)
I swerve Mercedes Benz 'cause my credentials up (Yeah)
I told her I got my millions up, these racks, baby (Racks)
This song is hard as goosebumps, rash, baby (Racks)
I'm scorin' by the three, Steve Nash, baby (Yeah)
A couple million fee, all cash, baby (Yeah)
I eat all of your cheese and racks, baby (Ayy)
I eat a lil' cheese like a snack, baby (Yeah)
The orange and black seats, Daffy Duck (Ayy, ayy)
Five-leaf clover, better luck
Don't you ask, "Do I know you?" Never, yuh (Yeah, mmm)
I've been flyer than a pelican, yeah (Let's go)

[Chorus: Aminé]
Compensatin' for your feelings
And you know the feelin'
This is what you thought would heal it
But it makes you feel it
Tryin' things you thought would cheer it
But you grow to fear it
Times, they come and go like spirits
I see these signs the clearest

[Bridge: Young Thug & Aminé]
You've been givin' niggas surgical head (You've been)
You've been eatin' out a young nigga flesh (You've been)
You might win the key to my chest (You've been)
You might win, give a young nigga head (You've been)
You might win the key to my chest
You might win the key to my chest
You might win the key to my chest
You might win the key to my chest (Ayy)

[Refrain: Aminé]
I fucked up once again
And you know that I'm never too proud to beg
It's hard to admit that I've made my bed
And you know I'ma always wish you the best
Look, bitch, roll inside the Benz
I fucked up once and I got you bent
It's hard to admit that I've made my bed
But you know I'ma always wish you the best (Yeah)

[Verse 1: B.B. King]
Once upon a time, a long long time ago
Wherever you'd lead me, I would surely follow
Girl, you put me through some pain and misery
And now you're standing at my doorstep
Telling me how much you need me

[Chorus: B.B. King & D'Angelo]
Baby, (Nobody's home), ain't nobody home
(Nobody's home) Ain't nobody home

[Verse 2: D'Angelo]
How many times I begged you to come home
But you laughed at me, and said let me alone
Through my falling tears, I saw you walk away
And now you're beggin' me to forgive you
But this time, baby, it's your turn to beg, baby, baby

[Chorus: B.B. King & D'Angelo]
(Nobody's home) Ain't nobody home
(Nobody's home) Ain't nobody home

[Bridge: B.B. King]
Girl, I used to love you
Placed no one else above you
Gave you everything that I own
You can't come back here
Ain't nobody home

[Verse 3: B.B. King & D'Angelo]
Once upon a time, when you went on your way
Girl, I hoped and prayed, that you'd come back some day, baby
But time has made some changes (Yeah), turned me upside down
Now you can beg me (Will you beg me?) to forgive you, baby
But this time, it's your turn to beg, baby

[Chorus: B.B. King & D'Angelo]
(Nobody's home) Ain't nobody home
(Nobody's home) Ain't nobody home
(Nobody's home) You know hurt me one time too many
(Nobody's home) Ain't nobody home
(Nobody's home) Go get you somebody else to hurt, baby
(Nobody's home) I can't take it no more
(Nobody's home) Ain't nobody, nobody, baby
(Nobody's home) Ain't nobody, nobody, baby
(Nobody's home) Ain't nobody, ain't nobody
(Nobody's home) Nobody home
(Nobody's home)

[Outro: D'Angelo]
Ain't nobody home, hoo, nobody home
Ain't nobody home
Hurt somebody else, baby
Ain't nobody home, baby, baby
Oh yeah, ooh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh
Sometimes I wonder
Just what am I fighting for?
Oh, I win some battles
But I always, always lose the war

I keep right on stumblin'
In this no-man's land out here
But I know
Oh yes, I know
There must be a better world
Must be a better world somewhere

Flying high
Some joker clips my wings
Just because he gets a kick
Out of doing those kind of things
I keep on fallin' in space
Or just hangin' in mid-air
I know
Ohh yes, I know
There's just got to be a better world somewhere
Out there
Every woman I want
Seems like she only wants herself
And everybody I love
They are seem to love somebody else
And every woman
Got a license to break my heart
And every love affair it's over
It's over
Over before it gets a chance to start

If it ain't dead
Maybe in the year after
Instead of tears
I'll learn all about laughter
But meanwhile
But meanwhile I'm stuck out here
It just ain't fair, but I know
Oh yes
Yes, I know
There must be a better world
Better world
Better world somewhere

Every man I want
Only wants himself
Everybody I love
Seems to love somebody else
Every man is got a license
A license to break my heart
And every love affair is over
It's over before it gets a chance to start
If it ain't here
Maybe in the here after
Instead of tears
I'll learn all about laughter
But meanwhile
Meanwhile I'm stuck out here
I'm stuck out here
It just ain't fair, but I know
I said I know, oh yes I know
There must be a better world somewhere
Somewhere
There's just gotta be
There's gotta be
Gotta be a better world somewhere
Somewhere out there

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
Gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
See the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs

[Pre-Chorus]
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana, uh-huh

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone

[Pre-Chorus]
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer

[Bridge]
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind)

[Chorus]
(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man) Oh yeah
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, the man) Change
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
Change

[Outro]
Woo, woo (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana) woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Gonna feel real good (Oh yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana)
Oh no, oh no
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, shamone (Change)
Just lift yourself, you know
You've got to start with yourself (Yeah), hoo!
(Make that change) I gotta make that change today, woo!
(Man in the mirror) You got to, you got to not pick yourself, brother, hoo! (Yeah)
You know (Make that change)
I've gotta get that man, that man (Man in the mirror)
You got to, you got to move, shamone, shamone
You got to stand up (Yeah) stand up
(Make that change) Stand up, stand up and lift yourself now (Man in the mirror)
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know (Change)
Make that change

[Verse 1]
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
When the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Verse 2]
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I

[Breakdown]
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I

[Outro]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today

Empty words are not enough
Where there's hurt we'll be a crush

Maybe you and I can't do great things (Do great things)

She dances in the sheets at nights
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

She's a slave to the rhythm

She dances for the man at work
Who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says
"Sir, I must be home tonight"
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be out her mind

[Chorus]
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

[Bridge]
She works so hard, just to make a way
For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains

[Verse 3]
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

[Chorus]
Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

I know just what you're thinking
I see your clock is ticking
And that's ok that's what you came for
Let's say that you're the user
And I'll be your computer
You need to know how to turn it on

I ask where your finger is
Just come and feel me if you need help
I'll give you clear instructions
On how to use my functions
Unless you wanna do it yourself

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It goes oooh, there's something bout it
Oooh, you got me started

Your finger don't stop until you got my pulse
Put your finger on my pulse

Boy let me make one thing clear
Just put your finger here
I'm sure you understand
That everybody let me see your hands
It feel good right?
Uh-huh

[Bridge]
It goes oooh, so now you got it

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy
You should've known better than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby (Baby, baby, baby)

[Verse 1]
I got my little black dress on, and some blood red nails
Yeah, I'm packed with poison
Going out for the kill
'Cause I made a mistake
Yeah, I kissed a snake
Now my hourglass shape's gonna seal your fate

[Pre-Chorus]
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
But this is the web, web that you weaved
So, baby, now rest in peace

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me (Yeah)
And I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy (Yeah)
You should've known better than to mess with me harder (Yeah)
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby (Baby, baby, baby)

[Verse 2]
Oh, little did you know
When you cross the line
That I'ma triple Scorpio, with a wicked bite
Ooh, can you feel the sting?
It's paralyzing
Now you're stuck with me
'Cause you fucked with me

[Pre-Chorus]
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
But this is the web, web that you weaved
So, baby, now rest in peace

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love ya until you hate me (Yeah)
And I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy (Yeah)
You should've known better than to mess with me harder (Yeah)
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby (Baby, baby, baby)

[Verse 1]
Too much in my pain
Too much in my head
Can feel it in fade
If you're not in my bed
Try goin' out, try changing my fume
Whatever I see, reminds me of you

[Chorus]
I know I need time so I'm waiting
To come up in no conversations
So just when I thought I erased ya
You show up with no invitation
No invitation, no-no invitation
No invitation, no-no invitation

[Verse 2]
I found someone else
And I try to pretend
He's better than you, but I'm kidding myself
As much as I hate
I hate to admit, I still haven't change
No, I still can't forget, no

[Chorus]
I know I need time so I'm waiting
But you come up in no conversations
So just when I thought I erased ya
You show up with no invitation
No invitation, no-no invitation
No invitation, no-no invitation

[Verse 1: fergie]
Of all the things we chose to 

[?]
You said you love me
What was the thing to say to ease the pain from games we play?

[Verse 2: will.i.am.]

[?]

[Chorus]
With a child's Heart
Go face the worries of the day
With a child’s heart
Turn each problem into play

[Verse 1]
No need to worry, no need to fear
Just being alive makes it all so very clear

[Chorus]
With a child's heart
Nothing can ever get you down
With a child's heart
You’ve got no reason to frown

[Verse 2]
Love is as welcome
As a sunny, sunny day
No grown-up thoughts
To lead our hearts astray
Take life easy, so easy, nice and easy
Like a child, so gay and so carefree
Yeah
The whole world smiles with you
As you go your merry way

[Chorus Outro]
Oh with a child's heart
Nothing's gonna get me, nothing's gonna get
Nothing's gonna get me down
Oh with a child's heart
Nothing's gonna get me, nothing's gonna get
Nothing’s gonna get me down
Oh with a child’s heart
Sing nothing's gonna get me, nothing’s gonna get
Nothing's gonna get me down

[Verse 1]
(Ooh) Hey my girl
She does something to my chemistry
And when I'm close I'm sure
I raise her temperature
'bout three degrees

Everyday, yeah
In every way she
Makes my motor purr
And I reciprocate
My life I dedicate to lovin' her

[Chorus]
So we've got a good thing going
A real good thing going yeah
That girl and me
And I don't have to ask
Cause I know it's
Gonna last eternally
(Now let me tell you what we got)

[Verse 2]
Understanding
Whenever handing any alibis
Instead of what you do
Where you been or what's the use
We're making nice

You see we've got a good thing going
A real good thing going yeah
That girl and me
And she don't have to ask
Cause she know it's
Gonna last eternally

[Intro]
You ever want something
That you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it
The more you want it
And then one day you get it
It's so good too
But it's just like my girl
When she's around me
I just feel so good, so good
But right now I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones
Because ooh

[Verse 1]
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she is away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she is always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

[Verse 2]
Wonder this time where she is gone
Wonder if she is going to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone
And this house just is no home
Anytime she goes away

[Verse 3]
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, know, know, know, know
I know, I know
Hey I ought to leave
I ought to leave her alone
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone

[Verse 4]
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone
And this house just is no home
Anytime she goes away

[Verse 1]
Got to be there, got to be there
In the, in the morning
When she says hello to the world
Got to be there, got to be there
Bring her, bring her good times
And show her that she is my girl
Oh what a feeling there will be
The moment I know she loves me
But when I look in her eyes I realize
I need her sharing her world beside me

[Verse 2]
So I have got to be there
Got to be there in the morning
And welcome her into my world
And show her that she is my girl
When she says, "Hello world!"
I need her sharing the world beside me

[Verse 3]
That is why I have got to be there
Got to be there where love begins
And that is everywhere she goes
I have got to be there so she knows
That when she is with me, she is home, yeah

[Outro]
Got to be there, got to be there, got to be there
Got to be there, got to be there, got to be there
Got to be there, oh baby baby got to be there, got to be there
Got to be there, got to be there, to be there
Got to be there, oh got to be there, got to be there
Got to be there, got to be there, got to be there

[Chorus: T.I.]
Check this, dig that
You know I be getting that
Money and them big stacks
You broke, I can fix that
You broke, I can fix that
Check this, dig that
You know I be getting that
Money and them big stacks
You broke, I can fix that
You broke, I can fix that

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I'm getting my hustle on, and I'm rolling
Forever getting that paper
Fresh out of prison, I'm glowing
Middle finger to them haters
Get your chick before she get stolen
One of my partners surely may take her
Send her back to you, pussy swollen

[?] messed up just like her makeup
Got an elephant memory, it's flawless
I remember all of y'all who was talking
Got a good mind to run in your office
Whip your ass in front of your bosses
My partner died in my honor
I'm responsible for his mama
His daughter, too
Bet you she can go whatever college she wanna
Still wrap rubber bands on my bankroll
Broke or something, I can't go
Bitches yelling out I'm the shit, I'm like tell me something I ain't know
My broker call, say my stocks 

[?]
Up 20 percent, so my profits
Increasing even in my absence
So my attitude is obnoxious
Contract almost expired
They get one more album off it

[?] make my contract big 

[?]
Got bitches on my sausage
And federales watching
Just one more year of paper, and I'm back to blowing broccoli

[Chorus: T.I.]
Check this, dig that
You know I be getting that
Money and them big stacks
You broke, I can fix that
You broke, I can fix that
Check this, dig that
You know I be getting that
Money and them big stacks
You broke, I can fix that
You broke, I can fix that

My niggas locked up for same shit like

Attitude fucked, that shit been good
Tell 'em I got a million, never gotta worry 'bout a thing

Shit get flipped then I'm back to the trap
Locked up with something that clap
If you don't get that, then bitch you get slapped
Bitch, I pop up, get this guap up

Money gettin' big,

Yeah, I'm the truth, that's what you not
It's my time, fuck your clock

City mine, the whole hood voted
This murder bidness, they know I showed it
Suicide, both doors floating
Me and T.I.P., GDOD
Got that work, COD
There ain't nothing free, you gotta pay a fee
That talkin' cool but ain't shit to me
Broke, I be damned if I go back
This Hustle Gang,and you know that
We earn respect so you owe that
With a middle finger, I'm like: "Hold that"

[Chorus: T.I.]
Check this, dig that
You know I be getting that
Money and them big stacks
You broke, I can fix that
You broke, I can fix that

You broke, I can fix that

[Verse 1]
Yeah, we grew up in the backseat
Singin', tappin' bare feet
Blaring daddy's radio
It was clothes on a clothesline
Skeeter zappin' porch lights
Blue collar, red dirt road
It was Ford, it was Chevy
Longneck, Bud heavies
It was RC Cola Cokes
It was blue jeans, skull rings
Dry, rotted tire swings
And yeah, that's all we know

[Chorus]
Yeah, here's to the middle of nowhere
Where the small town roots run deep
If you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Yeah, you was raised like me
I'm talkin' Florida, 'Bama, Georgia, Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas to Tennessee
So raise your beers, cheers, here's to BFE

[Verse 2]
It was chickens from the front yard
Grillin' in the back yard
Collard greens on the stove
It was 'baccer, it was corn
Praise the Lord I was born in a town nobody knows

[Chorus]
Yeah, here's to the middle of nowhere
Where the small town roots run deep
If you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Yeah, you was raised like me
I'm talkin' Florida, 'Bama, Georgia, Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas to Tennessee
So raise your beers, cheers, here's to BFE

[Bridge]
Play that thing
Come on

[Chorus]
Yeah, here's to the middle of nowhere
Where the small town roots run deep
If you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Yeah, you was raised like me
I'm talkin' Florida, 'Bama, Georgia, Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas to Tennessee
So raise your beers, cheers, here's to BFE
Yeah, raise your beers, cheers, here's to BFE

[Outro]
That's right

[Verse 1]
Uh, leave it to me, if you want some bomb-ass weed, leave it to me
If you want a fire-ass verse, leave it to me
If you want a bad bitch taken, leave her with me
Uh, freeze up the sleeve, you would think it's Taco Tuesday, we get the cheese
I ain't too into her needs, but if she want it, I'ma get it for her
So much bottles, they askin' what I spend it for
Well, um (Well, um), if you wanna have a good time, leave it to me
If you wanna ride down Sunset, leave it to me
Tip the three-wheeler and we smokin' on good tree

[Bridge]
Woo
We goin' the fuck off right now, ha
(Statik Selektah)

[Verse 2]
Grew up like "Boyz N the Hood," shit wasn't all good
And now my mom got a crib, the backyard is all woods (Hahaha)
Shoutout to Chevy and my brothers too
Uh, try to copy my style, but wasn't ready
I'm at the crib rackin' up plaques and buildin' Chevies
A lot of food stacked on my plate, I'm gettin' heavy
I came and took my spot in the game, no one let me
Now outer space is my destination
Stuck around niggas who showed love instead of hatin'
And gettin' money's my occupation, haha
Look at the time you wastin'
If you can't roll up a paper, leave it to me
Turn up the bass and wake up the neighbors, leave it to me
Makin' sure everyone's safe, leave it to me
6AM, gin shot straight, leave it to me
This exactly where I'm supposed to be
Hella weed, nothin' but real ones close to me
Get in the gym and never fold
Real peaceful nigga, but hands they don't wanna throw with me
Lotta legends been on the road with me
Really good aim, I don't use no scope
One shot and that's all she wrote (And that's all she wrote)

[Verse 1]
(He's like)
Water when I'm thirsty
Even when I'm quenched, I still can't get enough
(He's like)
Fire when I'm cold
With just a simple touch, he warms me

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, storms come without a warning
If we get through this tonight, we can make it to the morning
Because if I can't be your girl

[Chorus]
Then what kind of world would it be without you?
Like a mountain so high to reach
(What kind of world?)
'Cause if we can't live in the sky
Then I might as well drown in the sea
(What kind of world?)
Finally my search is over and I found where I belong
But somehow we went wrong, oh

[Post-Chorus]
What kind of world? Ah
What kind of world?
(Oh, what kind of world? Yeah)

[Verse 2]
(He's my)
Air that I'm breathing
I don't need a reason, I would never leave him
(He's my)
Shelter from the rain
And I'll keep on clouded 'til we reach love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Storms come without a warning
If we get through this tonight, we can make it to the morning, oh
Because if I can't be your girl

[Chorus]
Then what kind of world would it be without you?
Like a mountain so high to reach
Said what kind of world?
'Cause if we can't live in the sky
Then I might as well drown in the sea
(What kind of world?)
Finally my search is over and I found where I belong
But somehow we went wrong, oh

[Post-Chorus]
What kind of world?
(Ooh, what kind of world?)
What kind of world?
(Oh, if you're not here with me, oh)

[Bridge]
See, the lesson I've learned is that love is all
And I would tear to burn to be proven wrong
So I keep on searching, keep on preaching, keep on praying
And I can't give up 'til I'm your girl

[Chorus]
So what kind of world would it be without you?
Like a mountain so high to reach
(So tell me, ah)
Said what kind of world?
'Cause if we can't live in the sky
Then I might as well drown in the sea
(What kind of world?)
Finally my search is over and I found where I belong
But somehow we went wrong, oh

[Post-Chorus]
What kind of world?
What kind of world?
What kind of world?
What kind of world?

[Verse 1]
Mama said, "Don't ever bring a white girl home to me"
Papa said, "Niggas catchin' cases every week
So you best stay on your feet"
Crazy (Crazy)
You can't seem to find why you phase me (Phase me)
And I just don't know why you're clingy (Clingy)
She's blind and doesn't understand the feeling
So I've had enough

[Chorus]
I'm fed up with the mall, I'm fed up with my dogs
I'm fed up with the looks that we get in restaurants
And no, it's not a law, but you know we ain't the same
I'm fed up with a world that I know I can't change
I'm fed up with your fam, you fed up with my fam
We try and tell 'em, but they try and tell us that we can't
And no, it's not a law, but you know we ain't the same
I'm fed up with a world that I know I can't change

[Verse 2]
Now I'm fighting the ways in enlight'ing you
And your friends clench their purse
Lock their doors when I'm around
And we both know how that sounds
And your parents, your parents
They don't know about me
I say, "Let's leave town," but I feel like I'd get shot down
And I'm tired, so this ain't worth the risk

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm fed up with the mall, I'm fed up with my dogs
I'm fed up with the looks that we get in restaurants
And no, it's not a law, but you know we ain't the same
I'm fed up with a world that I know I can't change
I'm fed up with your fam, you fed up with my fam
We try and tell 'em, but they try and tell us that we can't
And no, it's not a law, but you know we ain't the same
I'm fed up with a world that I know I can't change

[Bridge]
Mama said, "Don't ever bring a white girl home to me"
Papa said, "Niggas catchin' cases every week
So you best stay on your feet"
Crazy (Crazy)
You can't seem to find why you phase me (Phase me)
And I just don't know why you're clingy (Clingy)
She's blind and doesn't understand the feeling (Feeling)
So I've had enough

Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
Gangster Grillz you bastards

Hello, I’m Harry Styles, and tonight I’m going to help you drift off to sleep with some soothing words and calming music. A sleep story just for you. With all the business of your day, I know how hard it can be to go to sleep. So, thank you for choosing this story, and me, to help you. I wish you a wonderful night sleep. So make yourself comfortable, take a deep breath in, and then out. In, and then out. And when you’re ready, close your eyes

Have you ever wondered what happens when you sleep, where you go and what you feel; the places that you seek? When you start to drift away, your mind becomes a book that writes itself, then fades away before you wake to look

Tonight we’re going to think about anything you’d like. So, first let’s visualize some scenes to see us through the night. Settle back and clear your mind. We’re heading somewhere special, beyond the world of consciousness, to places more celestial

I’d like you to imagine now you’re there beneath the stars. Which, when you pause to think about it, actually you are. As you focus on the darkness right before your eyes, feel the scenes with glinting lights to emulate night skies

Think about the things you cherish most and those you love, and then allow yourself to be embraced from up above. The power of the universe meanders through your mind. So, come with me and let’s see what the two of us can find

Let’s travel now to moonlit valleys blanketed with heather; the kind of landscape you and I could dream about forever. Imagine lazing on the ground, succumbing to the charms of blades of grass we now caress with fingertips and palms

A gentle scent of cedar wood is floating on the breeze; a gift from mother nature and her nearby cedar trees. We’re gazing on the night sky now, marveling at infinity. So, allow your mind to wander to a peaceful, new vicinity

Picture this: a rich green forest damp with morning dew. Inhale the morning air as we explore, just me and you. Leaves create mosaics in every shade of green, as gentle birdsong mingles with the babbling of a stream

Dappled sepia sunlight cuts through branches of ahead, as dew drops fall from leaf to leaf, like glistening strands of thread. The dew drops finally coalesce forming satin beads. Occasionally they kiss our cheeks. Small pleasures; quenching needs

Holding hands, we stroll, until we chance upon a brook. Its cool, clear water mirroring our faces as we look. A shimmering reflection shows us smiling from above. The world we think but dare not speak, is L-O-V-E; love

Now, we snuggle on a raft and drift for endless hours. As willow trees sway in the breeze and blossoms fall in showers. Gently swaying to and fro, we look up at the sky and watch the clouds above us forming shapes as they pass by
The wisps of cloud swirl slowly, tinged with tangerine and pink, and as they fade, the sunset give us cause to muse and think of places we should visit and the oceans we could cross. For some who wander through this world, there’s grace in being lost

Passing by a waterfall, our thoughts sway to and fro, and time begins to fade and blur beneath the moon’s pale glow. A symphony of tumbling water, lulls and mesmerizes. Nature’s soundtracks to our dreams assumes so many geysers

Strolling on a sidewalk now, as rain begins to fall. Its gentle pitter-patter holds us deep within its thrall. The raindrops rhythm briefly slows, then intensifies. Peaceful and benevolent; a gift from moonlit skies

The fragrance the rain creates upon the concrete surface inspires, yet relaxes us and focuses our purpose to shift our minds to neutral and allow our thoughts to drift and recognize the rainfall as a mesmerizing gift

Sheltering beneath the porch, we watch the rain pour down. But, now the time has come to leave this dreamy moonlit town. A gentle breeze wafts through the trees, and causes leaves to stir, and then the rain relents and fades as time begins to blur

We find ourselves upon a shoreline, lounging by a lake. All crickets chirp in nearby reeds, it’s hard to stay awake. The scene feels like a watercolor; soft, diluted tones. As looking down we see each other laughing, skimming stones

The stones skip on the gleaming lake and ripples start to form, and though the sun has dipped from view, we feel content and warm. Herons drift on thermals, high above the sun-bleached pier, and in the trees beyond the lake, we glimpse a passing deer

Strands of cloud unfurl like ribbons in the orange sky. Mirrored on the lake now, like a painted butterfly. In the distance, mountains beckon, capped with pristine snow. The kind of sight that dreams evoke when hearts and minds let go

Contemplating nothingness, a scene takes shape before us. And as it sharpens in our thoughts, we hear a distant chorus, the dampened sound of silence that only snow can bring, surrounds us with its calming vibes, and touches us within

Glistening snowflakes fall in flurries. Mountain rivers freeze, the powdery slopes look beautiful, and fresh snow dusts the trees. Somehow, now, we’re in a cabin, taking in this view as the fire crackles in the corner just for me and you

We linger for a moment, or maybe it’s been hours for when we blink and look again, our vistas waft in flowers. Another destination lulls us; closer now, it seems. Perhaps it’s real, or just another chapter in our dreams

Drifting in and out of sleep, our thoughts take us elsewhere, to an island fringed by swaying palms, lush beyond compare. A path winds through the mangroves towards a distant beach, that underlines the turquoise ocean. Now, within our reach

Eventually, we feel the powdery sand right beneath our feet. The sun above now blessing us with gentle, soothing heat. We hear the lilting sound of surf breaking up ahead, while spiral shells and pearly shards determine where we tread
Finally, a lapping wave engulfs our sandy feet. It seems to pause and ruminate, then gradually retreat. We dig our toes in cool, wet sand. Then, sit and face the sea and let the sound wash over us. Alone, just you and me

Staring at the nothingness that stretches on forever, our thoughts dovetail and unify in tune, two minds together. As minutes turn to hours, we drift off somewhere new and visualize a stairway to a door we now walk through

Imagine now a meadow on a balmy afternoon. Birds, and bees, and rustling trees create a summer tune, flanked by fields of sunflowers. Hand-in-hand we walk as the gentle sound of nature surrounds us while we talk

The sunflowers give the scenery a warm and golden hue, while hazy sunshine softens our idyllic, rustic view. As we roam past hedgerows, a farmhouse sits alone. Its open shutters pressed against uneven walls of stone

A garden winds around the house and daisies poke through grass. A bench that’s lived through countless summers creeks as we walk past. We wonder if the house is empty; once loved, but no longer. The thought of passing time inspires a feeling that grows stronger

This feeling washes over us, lost between a sight. And as the sun begins to set, we stop and wonder why gravity caresses us and pulls you close to me. Then, the scene begins to fade on new reality

Deeper, gradually deeper, we drift and now transcend to unfamiliar places. Too surreal to comprehend. Slowly, we capitulate, as sleep begins to call. Entwined in dreams and shifting scenes, we drift and gently fall

Friendly faces, glorious places, things we hope to do; intertwined with snapshots. Some of me, and some of you. Moonlit valleys, verdant forests, gazing at the ocean, summer meadows, tranquil sunsets, steeped in pure emotion

The tenderness we feel when we are close, two minds as one, surrounds us and connects us. But, we’ve only just begun. For now, we dream together of all that is to follow. And now that sleep will keep us safe, for now until tomorrow

Maybe all the memories that we’ve gathered here tonight are all dreams now remembered, or wishes in plain sight. No matter what, they’re with us now, for this night and forever. And every time we close our eyes, they’re yours and mine to treasure

Goodnight, and sleep well

[Intro: Jacob Collier]
He won't hold you
Like I do, no
He won't bring out
The love in you

[Verse 1: Jacob Collier]
(He won't hold you)
I've been feeling down and out lately
(Like I do)
Baby, since you left me
(He won't hold you)
It's been so long since your body held me
(Like I do)
Won't you come and save me?
(He won't hold you)
I never was misunderstood, baby
(Like I do)
Since the day you met me
(He won't hold you)
Now I'm lost, I'm on my own, I feel so lonely
(Like I do)
Won't you resurrect me?

[Chorus: Jacob Collier]
(He won't hold you)
And all across from all around
The people make a people sound
They dance along the avenue
Of what I thought I knew
(He won't hold you)
And all across from all around
The people make a people sound (He won't)
They dance along the avenue
Of what I am to you

[Post-Chorus: Jacob Collier]
I won't be alright
I won't be alright
I won't be alright
And I won't be alright (Say it again)

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
Things rearrange, we miss what is not the same
I learned the value of what we had, taught by pain
Caught the rain, used it to wash my wounds
Learned the other side's grass wasn't as green
I bloomed, I grew
Took separation to get closer to you
You didn't let go and I held on too
Your arms were my armor
Karma cut us loose
You learned value, I learned truth
No one holds me down the way you do
But your feelings I let spill over and over and over
Just to cover for insecurities I couldn't show to Him
I had to face myself, my fears, my fails
Now I know there's nothing I can't do
I dance in the rain knowin' I can swim too
Found liberation, found my freedom
Where it begins is without you
I understand now
My only one, without you

[Chorus: Jacob Collier]
(He won't hold you)
And all across from all around
The people make a people sound
They dance along the avenue
Of what I thought I knew
(He won't hold you)
And all across from all around (Across from all around)
The people make a people sound (The people sound)
They dance along the avenue (The avenue)
Of what I am to you

[Post-Chorus: Jacob Collier]
I won't be alright
I won't be alright
I won't be alright (Be alright)
And I won't be alright

[Verse 1]
Does this make sense to you?
'Cause it doesn't make sense to me
Does this have weight for you?
'Cause it doesn't have weight for me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I think my mind is far away
Sorta strange, this is
But I think I'll call you anyway
Call collect, 'cause baby, this is

[Chorus]
An over-the-ocean call
And I thought I could make it short
But my brain's all out of sorts
I can't hide it
And I'm staring at my wall
And I thought that I wouldn't cry
But breaking your heart breaks mine
I can't hide it
An over-the-ocean call
Is how I told him
This isn't working anymore

[Verse 2]
I needed space from you
But this doesn't look like space to me, oh
And you hate the things I do
And sometimes you hate me

[Pre-Chorus]
But I think my mind is far away
Sorta strange, this is
But I think I'll call you anyway
Call collect, 'cause baby, this is

[Chorus]
An over-the-ocean call
And I thought I could make it short
But my brain's all out of sorts

I'm staring at my wall
And I thought that I wouldn't cry
But breaking your heart breaks mine
I can't hide it
An over-the-ocean call
Is how I told him
This isn't working anymore

[Bridge]
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine
I'll call from over the ocean
This time, this time, this time
I'll break your heart through the phone, I
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine
I'll call from over the ocean
This time, this time, this time
I'll break your heart through the phone, I
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine
I'll call from over the ocean
This time, this time, this time
I'll break your heart through the phone

[Chorus]
With an over-the-ocean call
And I thought I could make it short
But my brain's all out of sorts
I'm staring at my wall
And I thought that I wouldn't cry
But breaking your heart breaks mine
An over-the-ocean call
Is how I told him
This isn't working anymore
I left my city for San Francisco
Took a free ride off a billionaire's jet
LA, I'm from nowhere, who am I to love you?
LA, I've got nothing, who am I to love you when I'm feeling this way and I've got nothing to offer?
LA, not quite the city that never sleeps
Not quite the city that wakes, but the city that dreams, for sure
If by dreams, you mean in nightmares

LA, I'm a dreamer, but I'm from nowhere, who am I to dream?
LA, I'm upset, I have complaints, listen to me
They say I came from money and I didn't
And I didn't even have love, and it's unfair
LA, I sold my life rights for a big check and I'm upset
And now I can't sleep at night and I don't know why
Plus, I love Zach, so why did I do that when I know it won't last?

LA, I picked San Francisco because the man who doesn't love me lives there
LA, I'm pathetic, but so are you, can I come home now?
Daughter to no one, table for one
Party of thousands of people I don't know at Delilah where my ex-husband works
I'm sick of this, but can I come home now?
Mother to no one, private jet for one
Back home to the Tudor house that borned a thousand murder plots
Hancock Park, it's treated me very badly, I'm resentful
The witch on the corner, the neighbor nobody wanted
The reason for Garcetti's extra security
LA, I know I'm bad, but I have nowhere else to go, can I come home now?
I never had a mother, will you let me make the sun my own for now, and the ocean my son?
I'm quite good at tending to things despite my upbringing, can I raise your mountains?
I promise to keep them greener, make them my daughters
Teach them about fire, warn them about water
I'm lonely, LA, can I come home now?

I left my city for San Francisco
And I'm writing from the Golden Gate Bridge
But it's not going as I planned
I took a free ride off a billionaire and brought my typewriter
And promised myself that I would stay, but
It's just not going the way that I thought
It's not that I feel different, and I don't mind that it's not hot
It's just that I belong to no one, which means there's only one place for me
The city not quite awake, the city not quite asleep
The city that's still deciding how good it can be

And also
I can't sleep without you
No one's ever really held me like you
Not quite tightly, but certainly, I feel your body next to me
Smoking next to me
Vaping lightly next to me
And I love that you love the neon lights like me
Orange in the distance
We both love that
And I love that we have that in common
Also, neither one of us can go back to New York
For you are unmoving
As for me, it won't be my city again until I'm dead
Fuck the New York Post
LA, who am I to need you when I've needed so much, asked for so much?
And what I've been given, I'm not sure yet
I may never know that either until I'm dead
For now, though, what I do know
Is although I don't deserve you
Not you at your best and your splendor
With towering eucalyptus trees that sway in my dominion
Not you at your worst
Totally on fire, unlivable, unbreathable, I need you

You see, I have no mother
And you do
A continental shelf
A larger piece of land from where you came
And I?
I'm an orphan
A little seashell that rests upon your native shores
One of many, for sure
But because of that, I surely must love you closely to the most of anyone

For that reason, let me love you
Don't mind my desperation
Let me hold you, not just for vacation
But for real and for forever
Make it real life
Let me be a real wife to you
Girlfriend, lover, mother, friend
I adore you
Don't be put off by my quick-wordedness
I'm generally quite quiet
Quite a meditator, actually
I'll do very well down by Paramhansa Yogananda's realization center, I'm sure
I promise you'll barely even notice me
Unless you want to notice me
Unless you prefer a rambunctious child
In which case, I can turn it on too
I'm quite good on the stage as you may know
You might have heard of me
So either way, I'll fit in just fine
So just love me by doing nothing
And perhaps, by not shaking the county line
I'm yours if you'll have me
But regardless, you're mine
No one ever touched me without wanting to kill me
Except for a healer on 6th street in Ridgely
Tessa DiPietro,
recommended casually by a medium I no longer know

She said my number one problem was that my field was untrusting
When asked what to do, she paused and said “Nothing”
Which sent me right into uncontrollable sobbing

Because there’s never anything you can do about the important things

She said “Okay, one thing you can do is picture the floor rising up to support you,
And sink into the back of the bed that’s behind you
Too much of your energy is in front and above you”

Which, for some reason, made me think of a live show I’d seen
Jim Morrison at the Hollywood Bowl, 1968, check date

The blue trellis lights gave him an unusual aura
Like a halo or something
Made him 8 feet or taller
I remember just thinking he looked out of his body
but definitely like a god on stage

So I told her “Maybe an artist has to function a little bit above themselves,
If they really want to transmit some heaven”

And she told me
"A singleness of focus is the key to transmission,
For an emphasis on developing inner intuition,
Close your eyes and feel where you hold your attention

If it’s in the back of your eyes
Walk it down to your heart’s centre
and make that the new place from which your thoughts enter

Clairvoyance comes mostly from this simple function
Oh - and Jim died at 27
So find another frame of reference
When you’re referencing heaven

And have you ever read the lyrics to ‘People are Strange’?
He made no sense!"
Paradise is very fragile,
and it seems like it's only getting worse

Down here in Florida
We’re fighting red toxic tides
Mass of fish kills
Not to mention hurricanes and rising sea levels

Back in Los Angeles, things aren't looking much better
My treehouse that'd been standing for 80 years succumbed to the woolsy fire

Who would’ve thought that this year at 33
You would've been taken out from under me
After all those years?

Built from the ground up, by hand, by your very first owner
Quiet World War One, aviation pilot
I tried to save you but the German Shepherd seemed more important

Paradise is very fragile,
and it seems like it's only getting worse
Our leader is a megalomaniac,
And we've seen that before
But never 'cause it was what the country deserved

My friends tell me to stop calling 911 on the culture,
but it's either that or I 5150 myself

They don't understand
I'm a dreamer
And I had big dreams for the country
Not for what it could do, but how it could feel
How it could think, how it could dream

I know
Who am I to dream for you?
It’s just that in my own mind
I was born with a little bit of paradise
I was lucky in that way
Not like my husband
Who was born and raised in hell

I always had something gentle to give
All of me, in fact
It’s one of the beautiful things about me
It's one of the beautiful things about nature
But lately I’ve been thinking that I wish
Someone had told me when I was younger
More about the inhabitants that thrive off of paradise

That should they take too much,
There would be nothing left to give
Not everyone's nature is golden and green
And you can't fight what's in your nature

I got to thinking about it as
We were fighting the fires in Agora
But I’m tired of fighting you

Paradise is very fragile,
and it's only getting worse

And every time I think of that,
I think about the curse bestowed upon Eve, that fateful eve,
She took that bite of fruit from that fruitful tree
And this summer night, you in front of me,
Makes me contemplate the origins of good and evil

Because you take and you take and you take and you take,
But you taste like the beach and a kiss
Candy from my eyes
In my veins you run citrus
Watercolor images of serpents on orange trees
Arise in my midst
Kundalini, you breathe me
I could do this forever

But my heart is very fragile,
and I have nothing left to give

[Verse 1]
It ain't no accident, evident
I can see your love in a fingerprint
It ain't no mystery, I believe
When a feather falls right next to me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
That's my invisible angel
You might be so far away, but you're so close
We're like the lighting and thunder
A million miles from each other
But so close, yeah

[Chorus]
I can feel your energy around me
I can feel your energy around me
I can feel your energy around me
Oh, I can feel your energy around me

[Verse 2]
I hear you in the breeze, whispering
You're a light that keeps on flickering
It ain't no mystery, I believe
When the chills come rushing over me

[Pre-Chorus]
That's my invisible angel
You might be so far away, but you're so close
We're like the lighting and thunder
A million miles from each other
But so close, yeah

[Chorus]
I can feel your energy around me
I can feel your energy around me
I can feel your energy around me
Oh, I can feel your energy around me

[Outro]
It ain't no accident, evident
I can see your love in a fingerprint
It ain't no mystery, I believe
When a feather falls right next to me, yeah

Well, it doesn't necessarily have to be like she's into porn, but maybe she's into sex
Yeah, she don't like-, she don't like porn, but she like sex
She gets turned off and I'm like, "Yo', listen, we just-, you know, the camera actually is a-, is gon' compliment you"
Baby, why you trippin'?

Fuck on a bitch, I'ma see what it turn into
100 gecs, a bundle
Lets talk about it like a interview
Don't tell me that raps is mumble
It's two B's like a barbecue

Ayy, just talked to a gec
He said that my time is coming (Said it's my time)
Damn, I'm fresh out of fucks to give

Don't let 'em make you ugly
Know this shit can get hard when you down and hungry (Down in the dirt)
I cannot hear the phony
I got too many real ones that's counting on me
(Too many real ones that's counting)
Bless up, I was on your line and you let go
I ain't even gon' lie, you messed up
I was on your side for the long road
Now, you want my time, well, guess what
Well, I been moved on to the next one
I ain't even gon' lie, I can't front
You got my strongest love

[Chorus: Laura Les]
You can call on me anytime
And I'm runnin' home to you
But please remember, baby, baby
I'm not stronger than, stronger than you
You can call on me anytime
And I'm runnin' home to you
But please remember, baby, baby
I'm not stronger, stronger than you

Every day, Groundhog Day
Goin' through motions felt so fake

But every tear has been a lesson
Rejection can be God's protection
Long hard road to get that redemption
But no shortcuts to a blessin'

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while

I'm 2.0, remodeled
Used to be dull, now I sparkle
Had a piece of humble pie
That ego check saved my life

Now I got a smile like Lionel Richie
Big and bright, need shades just to see me
Tryna stay alive just like I'm the Bee Gees (Oh, woah)
A Mona Lisa masterpiece

[Chorus: Katy Perry & Diddy]
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (C'mon, smile)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful (So thankful)
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (Smile)
I thought I told you that we won't stop

[Verse 3: Diddy & Katy Perry]
I gotta crack a smile, even laugh a while (That's right)
Been through a lot, but I ain't backin' down (Let's go)
See, I came in the game with the flashy style (Woo)
Now I'm looking at the wealth that I'm passin' down
I'ma seen the light, it's a pleasing sight
Girl, we even manifestin' when we sleep at night (Right)
Fell down couple times, now we reachin' heights (Ha)
Yeah, to be precise, I'ma lead the fight (Woo, let's go)
Been appointed, light on your life so anointing
Catch me two-steppin', nigga, stressin' is pointless
No need to worry 'cause the truth is here
And I'm smiling, bitch, with my new veneers, yeah (Oh no no no no)

[Chorus: Katy Perry & Diddy]
Ooh I'm thankful (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (Come on, let me see that smile, smile)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful (Yo, check this out)
Now you see me shine from a mile (Why don't you smile?)
Finally got back that smile (Smile, and I smile)

[Outro: Katy Perry & Diddy]
I'm so (And we can smile together)
Grateful (You like that, yeah)
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally (I like that too, yeah, come on)
Oh oh (Take that)
I'm so (Yeah)
Grateful (I see you smilin', let's go)
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally (Katy Perry)
Oh oh (Diddy, yeah)

[Chorus]
Fuckin' these bitches, they came out of Milano
She want me to come, but ain't got all the time, no
The other day I was broke, came back in designer
Lil' mama left me alone, came back and the time's up
Ayy, singin' to the bank, my money staccato
I ain't on no bullshit, this ain't no Chicago
I went from jettin' from stores, to jet in the sky though
My nigga, the world yours, whatever's inside though

[Verse 1]
Two twenties on my head, just made it to six-speed
Used to have love for you bitches, now I'm like, "Bitch, please"
Now and then I gotta say it like my nigga Weeknd
Fuck needin' a bitch, I'm what a bitch need
Two hunnid thirty thousand on the Bentley
So even when it's dirty, know my shit clean
Got a thick bih', her name's Christina
Out Miami with the whip, hop out of Prestige, yeah
Ayy, shawty know I been on some boss shit, ayy
She fuckin' with me 'cause I'm a vibe, my nigga
I spent twenty-five all on my side bitch
And if I get caught, I'ma deny it
I'ma deny it, I'm a fuckin' rider
Got a bad bitch for the nigga, pussy fire
She strip down like Malia or Maya
And I been on the side tryna buy her some time off
Ayy, I'm hotter than Folgers
Money so thick, can't fold it, I told you
Came back, put my baby mama in a Rover
Card got no limit, bitch, I'm a soldier, ugh

[Chorus]
Fuckin' these bitches, they came out of Milano
She want me to come, but ain't got all the time, no
The other day I was broke, came back in designer
Lil' mama left me alone, came back and the time's up
Ayy, singin' to the bank, my money staccato
I ain't on no bullshit, this ain't no Chicago
I went from jettin' from stores, to jet in the sky though
My nigga, the world yours, whatever's inside though

[Verse 2]
Honey, am I wrong for thinkin' every woman wanna fuck me?
And if she don't, she probably gay, that's what it must be
None of my biddies put no niggas above me
I done pulled up Southside, all my bitches side-side of me
Couldn't be a fake nigga if I tried to be
Ayy, Louis Vuitton shorts, Dior, four-course
Let a goofy nigga fuck and we can't fuck no more
I'm a big money nigga on a jet
Girl, give me that pussy, let me make it wet for ya
I told you can get the world, baby, if you rep the set
She was out before the check
Alphabet, I'm a G, fuck her ex, no sweat
To the left, to the left, to the left
Everything you fuckin' own is in a box to the left
Ayy, I'm on the yachty, I got them thots to the left
She a bop, I'ma flex, got rocks for my neck, yeah

[Chorus]
Fuckin' these bitches, they came out of Milano
She want me to come, but ain't got all the time, no
The other day I was broke, came back in designer
Lil' mama left me alone, came back and the time's up
Ayy, singin' to the bank, my money staccato
I ain't on no bullshit, this ain't no Chicago
I went from jettin' from stores, to jet in the sky though
My nigga, the world yours, whatever's inside though

[Verse: Dylan Brady]
I was trying to find a way to kill time
I didn't even get to tell you goodbye
I was trying to find a way to kill time
Now you're gone and I can't ever say goodbye
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room
I couldn't go another day
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room
I couldn't go, go, go
Went and made it fun
Go, go, go, go
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room
I couldn't go another day
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room
I couldn't go another day
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room
I couldn't go another day
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room
I couldn't
Fun
Go, go, go, go
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room
I couldn't go another day
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room
I couldn't go, go, go
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
Get out of my blood, salamander!
I can’t seem to blow off enough steam to get you out of my head
Soul cycle you to death, run you out of my blood to San Pedro
And yet, everywhere I go, it seems there you are,
And there I am

I don’t want to sell my stories anymore, stop pushing me
Some stories aren’t meant to be sold
Some words aren’t meant to be told

I want to leave them underneath the nightstand to be forgotten
or remembered should my thoughts come upon them in the middle of the night after a long beach day
Or by you, some afternoon, to thumb through with your worn warm after-work hands
I love you, but you don’t understand me, I’m a real poet!
My life is my poetry, my love making is my legacy!
My thoughts are about nothing, and beautiful, and for free

You see, the things that can’t be bought can’t be evaluated, and that makes them beyond human reach
Untouchable, safe, otherworldy
Unable to be deciphered or metabolized
Something metaphysical,
like a view of the sea on a summer day on the most perfect winding road taken in from the car window

A thing perfect, and ready to become a part of the texture of the fabric of something more ethereal

Like Mount Olympus, where Zeus sent Athena and the rest of the immortals to play
I took a flying lesson on my 33rd birthday, instead of calling you
Or parking on the block where our old place used to be

Genesee, genesee, genesee

Pathetic, I know - but sometimes I still like to park on that street,
And have lunch in the car just to feel close to you

I was once in love with my life here,
In that studio apartment with you
Little yellow flowers on the tops of trees as our only view,
Out of the only window,
Big enough for me to see our future through
But it turned out I was the only one who could see it

Stupid apartment complex
Terrible you
You, who I wait for
You, you, you
Like a broken record stuck on loop
So that day, on my birthday, I thought
"Something has to change"
You can’t always be about waiting for you

Don’t tell anyone, but part of my reasoning for taking the flight class, was this idea that if I could become my own navigator
The captain of the sky,
That perhaps I could stop looking for direction
from you

Well, what started off as an idea on a whim,
Has turned into something more
Too shy to explain to the owners that my first lesson was just a one-time thing
I’ve continued to go to classes each week
At the precious little strip off Santa Monica and Bundy

And everything was going fine
We were starting with dips and loops
and then something terrible happened

During my fourth lesson in the sky
My instructor, younger than I, but as tough as you
Instructed me to do a simple maneuverer
It’s not that I didn’t do it,
But I was slow to lean the sports cruiser into a right hand upward turn
Scared, scared that I would lose control of the plane
Not tactfully and not gently
The instructor shook his head, and without looking at me said
“You don’t trust yourself”

I was horrified
Feeling as though I’d somehow been found out
Like he knew me
How weak I was
Of course, he was only talking about my ability as a pilot in the sky
But I knew it was meant for me to hear those words

For me, they held a deeper meaning
I didn’t trust myself

Not just 25,000 feet above the coast of Malibu
But with anything
And I didn’t trust you

I could’ve said something but I was quiet
Because pilots aren’t like poets
They don’t make metaphors between life and the sky

In the midst of this mid-life, meltdown, navigational exercise in self-examination,
I also decided to do something else I always wanted to do
Take sailing lessons in the vibrant bay of Marina del Rey
I signed up for the class as "Elizabeth Grant",
And nobody blinked an eye
So, why was I so sure that when I walked into the tiny shack on Valley Way, someone would say
“You’re not a captain of a ship, or a master of the sky!”
No, the fisherman didn’t care, and so neither did I

And for a brief moment, I felt more myself than ever before

Letting the self proclaimed drunkard captain’s lessons wash over me like the foamy tops of the sea

Midway through my forehead burned,
and my hands raw from driving
The captain told me the most important thing I’d need to know on the sea

“Never run the ship into irons”
That’s nautical terms for not sailing the boat directly into the wind

In order to do that though, you have to know where the wind is coming from

And you might not have time to look up to the mast,
Or up further to the weathervane
So you have to feel where the wind is coming from
On your cheeks, and by the tips of the white waves from which direction they’re rolling

To do this, he gave me an exercise
He told me to close my eyes, and asked me to feel on my neck which way the wind was blowing
I already knew I was going to get it wrong
“The wind is coming from everywhere, I feel it all over” I told him
“No”, he said “the wind is coming from the left. The portside”
I sat waiting for him to tell me “You don’t trust yourself”

But he didn’t, so I said it for him
“I don’t trust myself”

He laughed gentler than the pilot, but still not realising that my failure in the exercise was hitting me at a much deeper level

“It’s not that you don’t trust yourself” he said. “it’s simply that you’re not a captain. It isn’t what you do”

Then he told me he wanted me to practise everyday so I would get better

“Which grocery store do you go to?” he asked
“To the Ralphs in the Palisades” I replied

“Okay. When you’re in the Ralphs in the Palisades,
I want you, as you're walking from your car to the store,
To close your eyes, and feel which way the wind is blowing
Now, I don’t want you to look like a crazy person crouching in the middle of the parking lot,
but everywhere you go,
I want you to try and find which way the wind is coming in from
And then, determine if it’s from the port or starboard side,
So when you’re back on the boat you have a better sense of it”

I thought his advice was adorable
I could already picture myself in the parking lot,
Squinting my eyes with perfect housewives looking on

I could picture myself growing a better sense of which way the wind was blowing
And as I did, a tiny bit of deeper trust also began to grow within myself
I thought of mentioning it,
but I didn’t
Because captain’s aren’t like poets
They don’t make metaphors between sea and sky

And as I thought that to myself,
I realized
that’s why I write

All of this circumnavigating the earth,
Was to get back to my life
Six trips to the moon for my poetry to arise

I’m not a captain,
I’m not a pilot
I write!
I write
Last year, when I wrote you my last letter
the beginning of my future poetry
I acknowledged who you really were for the first time

I didn’t call you by any other name
I let you know that I knew the true nature of your heart
That it was evil, and that it convinced me that darkness was real
that the devil is a real devil
and that monsters don’t always know that they’re monsters

But projection is an amazing thing
after you left and burnt the house down
you tried to convince me that it was I who was holding the matches
You told me that I didn’t know who I was, but I do

I love rose gardens
I plant violets every time someone leaves me
I love the great sequoias of Yosemite
And if you asked my sister to describe the first thing she thinks of when she thinks of me
she would say "camp fire smoke"
I’m gentle
I’m funny when I’m drunk
But I haven’t been drunk for 14 years
I go on trips with my friends to the beach who don’t know that I’m crazy
I can do that
I can do anything
Even leave you

Because my bedroom is a sacred place now that there are children at the end of my bed
telling me stories about the friends that they pretend to hate, that they will make up with later
And there are fresh cut flowers that I grew myself in vases from the yard on nightstands, hand carved by old pals from Big Sur

And the longer I stay here
the more I am sure
But the more I step into becoming a poet
The less I will fall into being with you

The more I step into my poetry
The less I will fall into being with you
The more I step into my poetry
The less I will fall into bed with you

[Spoken]
Yeah, I used to be just like you
Summertime in New York
Walkin' around, just havin' a good time
Lookin' at all the girls
All the girls lookin' at me
To tell me to get out of the way so they could see my cuter friend
Oh, I hang around, I hung around with the
With the cute dudes
So I could, you know
You know
The big tall
You know, dark, handsome
That's me, I be right with them so you know, I could...
Whatever they didn't want, I could just...
"Hi, you think we could... nevermind"
But those days are gone
I can't even go outside no more
You think I don't miss it?
Yeah, I miss it
Then some crazy fools come up to me with a camera
And he got six other crazy fools with him
He said, "If I could just a picture of you and Michael Jackson together"
"If I could just... I could retire Prince, just let me get it, that's why"
That's when I knew things had changed
Now inside I'm still the same
Something else changed
Inside I'm still the same
Something else changed
Oooh
Y'all say it, don't rush, say it
Lay back, ooh
Oh yeah, c'mon (Ooh)
On the one, one more (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I got a beggin' woman
She beg me all the time
Beggin' woman
Beg me all the time
If I only had a nickle, guess what?
This -*- beg for a dime, oh, yes she did
Just poverty stricken, wait

I got a beggin' woman
Always beggin' me
Take her to the mall (uh huh)
She want everything little thing she sees
She even beg a second for a minute
She beg a long haired possum out a tree, oh yes she did
I ain't through talkin' about her

She beg my Aunt Gertrude
She even beg my Uncle Jake
She even tried to beg the sweetness
Out of my grandma's lemon cake
Oh, I got a beggin' woman
She beg me, beg me all the time
I still love her though
But I got one more thing I got to say
You know what, hang on

She's a cockeyed woman too
She look both ways at the same time
I don't know what she lookin' at
I just know I'm gettin' a little tired of tryin'

Listen
She ask me for the pepper
When she lookin' at the salt
Every time I try to guess right
It's always little Prince's fault
Beggin' woman
She beg me all the time (yes yes yes)
Oh no no no, I ain't through

She's three handed too
She know just what to do
She's right handed, left handed
And under handed too

With her right hand, she'll embrace you
While her left hand dims the lights
All the time she rehearsing
For another date she got tomorrow night
Three handed woman
She ain't gon' never, never, never treat me right
That's okay, don't cry for me
'Cause I'm gonna talk about her

With her left hand she'll caress you
With her right hand she'll straighten your tie
When you ain't lookin', she up on the phone
Callin' some other nappy headed guy
Right handed, left handed
And under handed too
One more thing

When she says goodnight
She say, "You the one
You're the one I'm about"
But you know, you steppin' in
Some other man is steppin' out
Oh, she thinks she's slick
But she cockeyed, she beg and she got three hands

But I'm looking for somebody that I can, uh mmm
I'm looking for somebody that I can just, mmm
Keep, keep
Lookin' for somebody that I can just keep satisfied
Keep the lights down low
Y'all wanna help me?
Up stroke
Y'all wanna help me?
This is the up stroke
Y'all wanna help me?
Up stroke, uh
Tell me that ain't funky
I specialize in funk just to keep you satisfied
Come on!

Make some noise in A, oh

Look like I'd get you off of my mind
But I can't
Just the thought of you
Turns my whole world misty blue
Oh honey, just the mention of your name
Turns the flicker into a flame
Listen to me good, baby
When I think of what we used to do
My whole world turns misty blue
Oh baby, I hated, I can't forget you
Heaven knows I tried
When I say, when I say that I'm glad we're through
Deep in my heart I know I've lied
I've lied
I've lied, baby, because that man, oh that man
Mmm, had thought about her when I woke up in the morning
I thought about it when I laid my hand on my bed at night
And since she's been gone, you know, I'm looking for that new love
Is it out here? Is it out here?
Is it out here somewhere? Somebody help me
Oh, oh, baby, I can't
I can't forget you
My whole world turns misty blue
Oh, oh baby, I can't forget you
My whole world turns misty blue
Oh, I can't forget you
My whole world turns, turn, turn, turn
Oh, oh baby, I can't, I can't forget you
My whole world turns misty blue

Reciprocity, have a cup of tea
Live a life of quarantine, never see Jack (Eso)
But I'ma guarantee to make a sound, all around
Hit the ground, never fall flat (Listo)

Accelerated, invigorated, gotta flow that

[Intro: Jacob Collier]
You're fast asleep I'm
I'm counting sheep
I'm in too deep
I'm in too deep

[Verse 1: Jacob Collier]
You been making me feel like I'm lonely, baby
I don't know what I did wrong
I don't know what
Lately I been driving myself crazy, baby (Oh, oh)
Girl you left me all alone, you know that

[Chorus: Jacob Collier]
Did I forget to feel?
Everything is falling down
Baby, this old world is nothing without you
I don't know what I can do
I thought it was real
But girl you got me crashing down
Baby, I still love you, Lord, I know it's true
I don't know what I am to you
Now I'm all alone

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Kiana Ledé, Jacob Collier]
Something in me hopes that you still love me, baby (Oh yeah)
But I know you been moving on, I know that (Hey)
Thinking like I been feeling this without you, baby (Oh babe)
I miss you more than I let on, you know that

[Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
When our love was new
I remember holding you
Hoping everything you needed I could do
That I could do it all for you
I wish that it was true
But boy you left me here too long
Thinking I still love you, Lord I know I do
But I'm never coming back to you
Now I'm on my own

[Outro: Jacob Collier & Kiana Ledé]
Now I'm on my own
On my own
Now I'm all alone
Counting sheep
I'm in too deep
You're mine to keep
You're fast asleep
I'm counting sheep
I'm in too deep
You're mine to keep
You're fast asleep
Now I'm all alone
Counting sheep
I'm in too deep
You're mine to keep
You're fast asleep
I'm counting sheep
I'm in too deep
You're mine to keep
You're fast asleep
Now I'm on my own
Counting sheep
I'm in too deep
You're mine to keep
You're fast asleep
Now I'm on my own
I'm counting sheep
I'm in too deep
You're mine to keep
You're fast asleep
I'm counting sheep
I'm in too deep
You're mine to keep
You're fast asleep, I'm

Set
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
So take me to your open skies
I just wanna feel alive
I wanna feel your butterflies
Do you ever fantasize
'Bout me when you close your eyes? (Away)
'Cause I can feel your butterflies

[Refrain]
I wanna feel your butterflies
I wanna feel your butterflies

[Chorus]
So take me to your open skies (Take me to your open skies)

[Outro]
Wanna feel your—
Wanna feel your—
Feel your butterflies
Oh, I wanna feel your butterflies
Hey, yeah
Oh, I wanna feel your butterflies

[Verse 1]
You've been feeling like you're running away (Ooh, ooh)
You've been trying to think of something to say (Oh, oh-oh)
But I've been thinking it's no matter at all (Ooh, ooh)
I think we thought of saying nothing before (Oh, oh-oh)
Yeah, I decided to remember your name (Ooh, ooh)
You were avoiding me and it was a shame (Oh, oh-oh)
Now the time has come for me to admit (Ooh, ooh)
I don't think I could be your line of best fit (Oh well)

[Pre-Chorus]
My bed is made of feathers
I'll fall asleep, whatever now (Ooh)

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been sleeping on my dreams, ah
And I can't remember what I mean to you
And everything is what it seems, ah-ah, ah-ah
I've been sleeping on my dreams, ah-ah (Oh)
'Cause I've been thinking 'bout some things, ah
And I do believe our many days are through
Don't think I'm lost without your wings, ah-ah, ah-ah
I've been sleeping on my dreams, ah-ah

[Verse 2]
So I imagined we were playing a game
Something like you could be an animal and all I had to do was be tame (Ah-ah-ah)
I watch you flying 'round with nothing to lose
I thought that was the kinda levitation no person could ever abuse (I was wrong)
My boots were getting heavy and I (Oh, oh-oh)
I said I'll meet you at the corner like a twinkle in my elephant eye (Oh, oh-oh)
But uh, I think the time has come for us to admit
It could be weird for us to try to commit
(Oh well)

[Pre-Chorus]
My bed is all my pleasure
Now I'll fall asleep forever now (Ooh)

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been sleeping on my dreams, ah
And I can't remember what I mean to you
And everything is what it seems, ah-ah, ah-ah
I've been sleeping on my dreams, ah-ah (Oh)
'Cause I've been thinking 'bout some things, ah
And I do believe our many days are through
Don't think I'm lost without your wings, ah-ah, ah-ah
I've been sleeping on my dreams, ah-ah

[Bridge]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I've been thinking 'bout our dreams, oh-oh
Ooh da, da-da

Ooh da, da-da
Ooh da, da-da

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been sleeping on my dreams, ah
And I can't remember what I mean to you
And everything is what it seems, ah-ah, ah-ah
I've been sleeping on my dreams, ah-ah (Oh)
'Cause I've been thinking 'bout some things, ah
And I do believe our many days are through (Our many days are through)
Don't think I'm lost without your wings, ah-ah, ah-ah
I've been sleeping on my wings, ah-ah, ah-ah
I've been sleeping on my dreams, ah-ah

[Verse 1: Tori Kelly]
It ain't always easy gettin' through to you
Complicatin', overthinkin' every move
I like to think you know the things here in my mind
But here we are, I can't seem to get this right
I don't know how to do it
I get so close to you'n
But then you look at me like I'm not there
I'm always thinkin' 'bout ya
Wanna learn how to love you
Keepin' me in the dark, it just ain't fair
I wanna know about it
If you wanna talk about it, I'll be waiting for you to take me there
So won't you tell me what you wanna do?
'Cause, baby, it don't matter to me

[Chorus: Tori Kelly & Jacob Collier]
Even if you say that you’re alone, oh yeah (Yeah)
Even if you wanna let it go, don't (No, oh)
Keep it to yourself
I wanna make it feel alright (Wanna make it feel alright)
If you been running out, running out
Running out of love (Love, love)
Running out of love

[Post-Chorus: Jacob Collier]
Oh, yeah, yeah
Love, love, love, love, love (Love, love)
Oh

[Verse 2: Jacob Collier, Tori Kelly, Tori Kelly & Jacob Collier]
Every morning, I wake up and you're not there (Ooh)
But you know I'm always thinking 'bout you then, uh (Oh, woah)
'Cause I like to think you know
The way I feel about you deep inside (Ooh yeah)
But here we are, and I just want to make things right
I don't know how to do it
Right now, we're going through it
Making you feel like we be goin' nowhere (Ah)
I'm always thinking 'bout the time we be spending together (Woo)
Right now, I guess I need you more than ever
So tell me all about it (Tell me all about it)

So won't you tell me what you're going through (Oh)
'Cause, baby, it don't matter to me

[Chorus: Tori Kelly & Jacob Collier]
Even if you say that you're alone, oh

If you been running out, running out
Running out of love (Love, love)

[Outro: Jacob Collier, Tori Kelly, Tori Kelly & Jacob Collier]
I'm sorry I can't always be around you
I'm sorry if you think I don't care
'Cause I don't wanna leave you feeling lonely
I've been running out, running out, running out of love
I'm sorry I can't always be around you
I'm sorry if you think I don't care (Ooh, woah)
'Cause you will always be my one and only
I've been running out, running out, running out of love
I'm sorry I can't always be around you (Running out)
I'm sorry if you think I don't care (Care)
'Cause I don't wanna leave you feeling lonely
I've been running out, running out, running out of love
I'm sorry I can't always be around you (Running out, running out, running out)
I'm sorry if you think I don't care
'Cause you will always be my one and only
I've been running out, running out, running out of
Love
Love
Love
What happens if I—

I don't know why
I'm gonna take my words off
The pressure be 'pon me
What happens if I take my words off-off?
Wanna cramp your style, wanna cramp your style
Light it up on me, light it up on me

Feeling alone can be
Something you own like your
Mother and father
Feel like saying something, all I know is nothing

[Verse]
This is what the COVID list made
All this hate, all this hate
Look at what the COVID list made, all this pain
Try to keep us quiet, cause riots
Look at what the COVID's made, this hate
That the COVID made, this hate
Try to keep us quiet, cause riots
Try to keep us quiet, cause riots
How 'bout we change up our diet?
How 'bout we change the diet?
How 'bout we get a real plan
How 'bout we change up the meal plan
How 'bout we stop hidin' in bunkers and be a real man
It's only for God, I'm a real fan
The system will fall and God's people will stand
I know 'cause God willed this, I know you can feel this
God is the real this, the Devil can't kill this
I know because he willed this
We 'bout to go big, yes we will, Kris
We 'bout to go big, Robert, yes we will
Kris, Kardashian, Rob, Kardashian
First to get a nigga free, now my wife big
Up with that again
We gon' take Sunday Service to The Vatican
Ooh, we 'bout to spaz again
I heard The Pope speak twenty-seven language
The only language is love and that's God goin' at again
Uh, pssht, we get the practice in
Uh, pssht, no more actressin'
Uh, pssht, this the fact, this is
Uh, pssht, ah
That's how the freestyle go

[Verse]
Robert Kardashian, before, now I'm not sayin'
If O.J. did it, or O.J. did not do it, I do not know
But I know that when I lived in my father's house
And I saw that verdict come, as a Black person
We felt that it was a victory
For all of the times that a Black person was wrongfully accused
And sentenced to death, execution in thirty states
Thirty states still execute, thou shall not kill
Thou shall not spill human blood for your own excuse
Now we walk through the residue
Put God out the better schools
Now look what we headed to
Wash us in the blood, rain down on us
Wash us in the blood of Jesus
Okay, now go ahead
So you're against the death penalty?
Thou shall not kill

[Verse]
I am sorry to God because dirt is actually a negative word
It's Earth, this is Earth, this is Earth
This is God's turf, let's show 'em what we worth
Let's do a rebirth, this is unrehearsed
Hold up, let me talk first, it's way been worse
Reach into your purse, shoutout to Damien Hirst
We don't need to go berserk, they try to put our mind to work
They try to influence the hurt, tell me, what's the purpose?
Look at all the perks, I was addicted to Percs
Drug addiction, for the Devil, it works
Look at all the jerks, now we make it hurt
Nah, now we make it love, God up above
Nah, nah, now we free, all we could be
Yeah, yeah, I could see, now they can see, yeah, yeah
We free
I told ya I could catch a vibe on this
I think you've got, I think you've got your campaign song there
Oh, we got more than that, we got way more

[Verse 1]:
When I was a kid I loved hangin' out
Down at the ol' dirt track
Was my dream to be out there
The leader of the pack
I had to wait all week for Sunday
But it never comes too fast
When they hit that track
They ain't lookin' back
They're gonna give no price to blast

[Chorus]:
It's a white knuckle ride
There's only one thing on my mind
It's being the first to cross that finish line
White knuckle ride
I love leavin' y'all behind
If I don't run out of gas
And my tires will last
I'm gonna take that checkered flag

[Verse 2]:
Well I love my job 'cause I love my car
When I hear that engine roar
Strap me in, let the race begin
I put the pedal to the floor
Now I got me a big time sponsor
The best crew workin' for me
But I ain't any different
Than the way I used to be

[Chorus]:
It's a white knuckle ride
There's only one thing on my mind
It's being the first to cross that finish line
White knuckle ride
I love leavin' y'all behind
If I don't run out of gas
And my tires will last
I'm gonna take that checkered flag

[Bridge]
That crash and burn
You can take that turn
A little bit too fast
But that's a chance you take
Putting on the brakes
Being let up off the gas

[Chorus]
It's a white knuckle ride
There's only one thing on my mind
It's being the first to cross that finish line
White knuckle ride
I love leavin' y'all behind
If I don't run out of gas
And my tires will last
I'm gonna take that checkered flag

[Outro]
Come on, boys
White knuckle ride
White knuckle ride
White knuckle ride
White knuckle ride

[Intro: Laura Les]
He said, "I love you," on the plane
I said, "I love you too"
He said, "Everything is different now, everything has changed
Always on a plane, always something new"
I said, "Nothing's new, nothing's changed, I still need you"
I'm 'bout to hit the boof
Smokin' somethin' new

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady]
Ro-ro-roll the boof, then I smoke, then it's all gone
Hit that G so hard that I fall off
Taking shots in the dark, that's a bad call
Going straight for your head, gotta saw it off
(Go, go, go, go, go)
I got a bag on the way
(Go, go, go, go, go)
Smokin' a zip in a day
(Go, go, go, go, go)
What were you trying to say?
(Go, go, go, go, go)
Making it up on the way

[Bridge: Laura Les]
I never say what I need, when I need you
Never say what I need, when I need you
I'm good on the weed but I need you
I might hit the weed, I might hit the boof

[Verse 2: Laura Les]
I'm addicted to Monster, money, and weed, yeah
I'm blowin' clouds so loud, you can't fuckin' see, yeah
I'm addicted to everything that I see, yeah
I’m addicted to making money off me, yeah
I might go and throw my phone into the lake, yeah
It ain't hard to quit caring what you think, yeah
Burnt me one too many times like a tree, yeah
Now there's fire raining down on your screams, yeah

[Outro: Laura Les, Dylan Brady]
Ohhhh
Yeah
Can you stay up for the weekend
And blame God for looking too old
Can you find all that you stand for
Has been replaced with mountains of gold

You cannot dream yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
For next year

God, I can't do this any more
Though I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door
I'm not alone

I'm not alone

If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone
If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone
No?

I'm not alone

If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone

If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone

Can you stay up for the weekend
And blame God for looking too old
Can you find all that you stand for
Has been replaced with mountains of gold

You cannot dream yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
For next year
God, I can't do this any more
Though I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door
I'm not alone

God, I can't do this any more
Though I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door
I'm not alone

[Verse: Meek Mill]
Listen, I'm the definition of a monster
Sitting like a mobster
Revolver on my lap, barrel full of Black Talons
I lick it at your squadron
Roll up like ‘hold up’, start spitting while I'm driving
Peel off, then roll up
You niggas better slow up, before you bang the fuck out
I aim, let it flame, blow your brains all the fuck out
All over your shirt, since a youngin' I was buck wild
All up in the dirt, ma screaming "Get the fuck out!"
North where I was raised at, South Philly I plays that
Whatever I'm around, I hold it down like a wave cap
Yeah my niggas stay strapped, blaze and I'ma blaze back
All over that yolk and get your motherfuckin' egg cracked
Northside of Bird Streeter, Southside of Eight Baller
Posted by the green gate, cops come we scrape on 'em
Niggas dropping tapes on ‘em, tryna get us locked down
Visit to the district, that’s enough to get you chopped down
Nine Parabellum, fuck around and hit a nigga momma cerebellum they ain’t riding man they telling
I be sliding with a seven, all titanium
Big boy style, jump around when I’m flaming ‘em
Yeah I play my role, getting hoes like I’m taming ‘em
Same one you kiss the same one that give me cranium
Every time I touch a gun, all I hear is Damien

[?] pipe me up and rock it baby like I’m Dame’in’ ‘em
I bounce on the track like I bounce on the bike
So nice wit’ it I ain’t even writing it

[?] on the low, blowing dro like 

[?]
645 on my side right in it
Yeah, they got Omelly all day, I’m in the house stressing out
Why I’m running all around, in the town acting out
Beef come we clap it out
All the real shit my niggas do, we don’t rap about
‘Cause niggas’ll rat you out, as soon as they get the word
I know niggas saying they homies as soon as they  get a bird
Niggas’ll get you served, like four-and-a-half
I’m the nigga with .32, I’ll put four in yo’ ass
I’m the nicest nigga out, out
Ain't nobody seeing me, the whole hood agree with me, I'm wiping niggas out
They like what I'm about
Shit every time I'm killing it, the whole hood feeling it, I got the word of mouth
Right now I'm on the south
Dealing with them killer niggas, sheisty and gorilla niggas, fuck it though we out
He talking what he ’bout
Nigga making threats, it's a bet, send my bloodhounds barking at his house
Like soon as he come out, give me what you got
And make sure you kill him ‘cause I want him in a box
Yeah the sons of Philadelphia, where drugs the only wealth for ya’
Where guns’ll take ya’ health for ya’, they won’t even send help for ya’

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

[Verse 1]
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
One, two, three, four

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
One, two, three, four

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you're the best

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the mornin' sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive, drive, drive

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

[Post-Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
The flowers wither
And the clouds grow bigger
Up in the garden alone, I'm freezing, but it’s fine
'Cause I'm thinking of you
And all of the things we could do
Running as fast as I can, glad I forgot to tie my shoes

[Pre-Chorus]
Falling isn’t really that bad
If it's for you
Your lips, your blush, your eyes, your touch

[Chorus]
Baby, you are really something else
'Cause I don't think I have smiled like this before
When I spend my time with you it tends to stop
Honey, being around you is all I need
Baby

[Verse 2]
Don't worry 'bout me
It's not as cold as it seems
So good to be the one who keeps you warm
These days, we're all good though
We’re walking under clouds, honey
Most of the time
I can’t believe my own eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Lookin' at you feels like a dream
Please, stay right here
Your lips, your blush, your eyes, your touch

[Chorus]
Baby, you are really something else
’Cause I don't think I have smiled like this before
When I spend my time with you it tends to stop
Honey, being around you is all I need
Baby

[Chorus]
Ahu
I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you show me a real good time
I never asked for the rainfall
At least I show up
You showed me nothing at all

[Bridge]
(uh uh uh uh)
It's coming down on me (uh uh uh uh)
Water like misery (uh uh uh uh)
It's coming down on me (uh uh uh uh uh)
I'm ready rain on me

[Refrain]
I'm out downpour but at least I'm alive
Rain on me,rain rain

(Rain on) rain on me,rain rain

[Chorus]
I didn't ask for the daylight
'Cause I was born for the night
And it changed my life
I knew the hurt wouldn't be small
You said you love me forever
But you don't call

[Bridge]
(uh uh uh uh)
It's coming down on me (uh uh uh uh)
Water like misery (uh uh uh uh)
It's coming down on me (uh uh uh uh uh)
I'm ready rain on me

Rain on me
I would love to tell you
Everything I've done before
But would you love me
For everything I've done before

And now I've fallen blue
With all these questions in my heart
Is there something left
Now that you have gone away

Well I would really like
To know what's wrong
Maybe in the truth
There is nothing wrong at all
And if you came on back
You'd know these songs are all for you
Oh oh oh whoa oh
Until our time
You should know
I would really love to
Get on back to you
You have got your magic working
On me 24 hours a day
(got your magic working on me, all day)
And I am lost in the thought
Of how you are today
(oh how was your day)

And now I'm in the cycle
Of staring at the sun
Is there something left for us
In our lives to come

Well I've been rhythm'd out
In an afterglow
(I've been rhythm'd out)
Save some love for me
You know I could use a little more
(Save some love for me)
And if you came on back
You'd know these songs are all for you
Oh oh oh whoa oh
Until our time
You should know
I would really love to
Get on back to you

[Intro: Domo Genesis & (Gil Scott-Heron)]
Yeah, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on my way
(I'm on my way home)

[Verse: Domo Genesis]
Wasn't with 

[?] niggas invented shit
Thankfully replenished just to show you what the difference is
I'm spaced out, I'm no human being
Just know if you ain't heard of me, I'm doing things
I was just inspired by some newer things, truer things ain't never been said
I never gave 'em leg room to get their shoes on my bed
I sleep on clouds, man my headspace clean as sweet flavor Febreeze
And we spray it with ease, don't debate with the G's
Have it all laid in pieces for me
Move discreetly, only seeing what I need you to see
I stay proving why I keep you where I need you to be
My overview complete so read it and weep
To read verses, seeds dirty
On knees while I wrestle with these vermins
Whole squad coming out that water like the Irwins
You can try to buy that aura but it's not for purchase
You can't make a boss' call when you ain't got the service
I crossed a lot of burned bridges, broke a lot of curses
My paper work straight, I jot it cursive
You can never script me, can't predict the weather
I sit in pressure, get my shit together
Uh, fuck

[Outro: Gil Scott-Heron]
I left three days ago, but no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is; home is filled with pain and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again"

[Verse 1]
What you lookin’ at now, baby?
Won't you use your own mind, oh
I’ve been all alone, right, baby
Can't do a sober drive, no
Fall in love in November nights
Cold weather in the winter time, oh, oh
Guess you know when the time is right
Let’s go on a little joyride, oh

[Chorus]
Livin’ life, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Livin’ life, la, la, la

A pound of weed and a bag of blow

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and

I get robbed of all my sleep
As my thoughts begin to bleed
I'd let go, but I don't know how
Yeah, I don't know how, but I need you now

[Chorus]
I can feel your love pullin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch pickin' me up from the underground, and
I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

[Intro: Drake & Future]
Wheezy outta here
Ayy

[Verse 1: Drake]
This ain't no regular shit
We never beggin' for shit
Niggas is ready to quit
Shit that they hate to admit
In Texas, I keep a rifle inside of the whip
Call it drivin' a stick
In Vegas, I get two million a night
From the Wynn, just to run through the hits
All that on top of the chips
Cash 'em all out, then I dip
Bet on fifteen 'cause of Nip
My pocket get blue like a Crip, ayy
What a slime to be alive
You don't want problems with the guys
She wanna come through just to vibe, well
We got different things in mind, well
London been treatin' me very well
Whole lotta chocolate and caramel
I cannot drive to the hotel
Might end up sleepin' in Annabel's
Summer, all I did was rest
New Year's, all I did was stretch
Valentine's Day, I had sex
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next

[Chorus: Young Thug]
What a time to be a slime, uh
Hit that pussy from behind, huh
What a time to be a slime, uh
Flipped it up and left a lime (Slatt, slatt), uh
What a time to be a slime
Niggas bitter when they ain't in they prime
What a time to be a slime
Niggas get rich, they say you droppin' dimes

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
This ain't no regular shit
I don't take regular shits
I could go Michael or Prince
Or I could keep the score how it is
I took a trip to the Ritz
I took advantage of the bitch
I told her to feed me some grits
Then I put on my shoes, and I dipped
If niggas tell you they fuckin' with me
I'ma gon' tell you that's caninini'
Opps say I'm never knowin' where that they be
Bitches be sayin' they always see me
I took two years off and now I'm OD
Rappers just thought it was over for me
Christmas, I bought her the flawless AP
Didn't read the caution and now it's elite
Moshpit, mob shit, mobster, rob shit
I go brazy in a mosh pit, pop opp shit, yeah
Mobster, Rastafari
I consume garden, lotta weed, follow me, yeah

[Outro: Young Thug]
Sex, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt

Lyrics From Snippet

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
-was our philosophy
Oooh, nani nani (ooh ah)
No bitch in my body, but
Your bitch in my lap, uh
Backwards at Pilates
Back to back that voodoo got-

[Chorus]
I love the way that you touch
I think about it too much
I just wanna give you my love (Yeah)
I told you I was screwed up
You said, "That make two of us"
I just wanna give you my love
I just, want to
I just want to give you my love
Okay, I just (I just), want to (I just want to)
I just want to give you my love (I wanna give you my love)

[Verse 1]
Well, there's nothin' better than for-for-forever
There's nothin' better than for-for-forever
I just want to give you my love (My love)
Mmm, so give me pleasure
Wear me like a sweater
Break me into little pieces, put me back together
I just want to give you my love
Yeah, I promised I was gonna call you
Got drunk and I guess I just forgot to
That don't mean that I don't love you
Even in my own world, I'm thinkin' of you
And when you're gone, I miss you
I might be gettin' too used to bein' with you
I'm always thinkin' 'bout makin' love

[Chorus]
I love the way that you touch
I think about it too much
I just wanna give you my love (Yeah)
I told you I was screwed up
You said, "That make two of us"
I just wanna give you my love (My love)
I just (Well, I just), want to (I really want to)
I just want to give you my love (I want to give you my love, love)
Okay, I just (Yeah, I just), want to (You know I really want to)
I just want to give you my love (You-you can have it all)

[Verse 2]
Okay, I spend a lot of time in the middle of the rough
I was lookin' for a diamond, but nothin' came up until you
Grace me with your presence
If you right here, who's flyin' round heaven?
Shit, I love your cars, all your wonderful flaws
I got a lotta love, I wanna give you it all
I just wanna give you my love
Yeah, I never told you I was perfect
I'm the person you can see the universe with
Who needs somethin' easy?
Tell me, when you close your eyes, do you see me?
You love me so much that the tears drop
Your heart in my sights, I got a clear shot
There's somethin' I don't say enough

[Chorus]
I love the way that you touch
I think about it too much
I just wanna give you my love (I wanna give you my love, yeah)
I told you I was screwed up
You said, "That make two of us"
I just wanna give you my love (Can you handle my love?)
I just (I just), want to (I just want to)
I just want to give you my love (I wanna give you, I wanna give you, yeah)
Okay, I just (Yeah, I just), want to (You know I really want to)
I just want to give you my love
Lyrics from Snippet:

[Verse]
White flowers and love letters
You say I'm yours forever
But it don't feel romantic, somehow
I'm pacing and I'm losing sleep
If you don't call I start to weep
You're everything I cannot do without

[Chorus]
I don't know who I would be
If I wasn't your baby
I built my life on your attention
On being an object of your affection
Now, crazy in love don't feel sweet
'Cause I'm with you but I miss me
Wish somebody had told me what I know now
Losing yourself in someone isn't Heaven, it's Hell
Mmm...
Wait a minute
Hurry up

Touch me at ur own risk
I'm not responsible
For anything I do
I lust you madly
Ur kiss is all I want
You're all I wanna do, mm

My analyst assured me
That you were just a phase
But I just can't stop this hunger
It's been going on 4 days
I lust you always...
You're all I wanna do
I lust you always
Darling, I lust you

Proceed with caution
You just might stop on something
You could never stop
Why I lust you always?
It's such a mystery
I guess you're too hot
My analyst assured me
That you were just a phase
But I just can't stop this hunger
It's been going on for days
I lust you always...
You're all I wanna do, oh
Alright
I lust you always
Darling, I lust you

Hate me all you want to
(Hate me if you want to)
Hurt me if you must
But I'll chase ur ass forever
(I will still love you)
All my body know is lust
Always
I lust you always
You're all I wanna do
Whoo

Touch me at ur own risk
I'm not responsible
For anything I do
Oh, I lust you always
I want to do more
Then I think you want me too
Yeah...
My analyst assured me
That I get over you
But  get the strangest feeling
That he wants to do you too
I lust you always - whoo! (Yeah...)
I lust you always
You're all I wanna do
Ooh yeah
I lust you always
Darling, I lust you

Ooh, baby, I lust you... always...
Lust you always
Whoo!
Hey
You know I'mo lust you always
Yeah...!
I lust you always
You're all I wanna do
You know I'mo lust you always

(Work out) (repeat)
Did you know there was a little purple fire
Burnin' N your eyes?
I must admit for a moment
It took my mind up off ur thighs
(Everybody work out)
Funny thing, but the thought of eating
Always makes me nauseous (Oh)
If I think of eating food
Ur body is more of what  had N mind
My darling, may I have a bite of you?
Slow motion ejaculation
Purple ecstasy
(Work out) (repeat)
My body reeks with lust
I will rape you, if I must
You see, my 4th grade teacher
Her name was Joni
I wanted so bad
To see her pantylines
But the principal of this episode
Says... (I said, work out)
"Why can't Prince just play with his?"
He can't, he won't
I'm sure he won't
(Everybody work out)
I mean, he doesn't play on
Any of Jamie Star's big toys
Cuz if he did
They'd sound like they were spinning 78's
Cuz only you could think
That funk is great (C'mon...)
But now...
How does that relate
To why I lust you always?

It doesn't
But that's what purple music's all about
Meaning it ain't rude
If you're in the mood
Turn it up, oh
Turn it up
Somebody turn it up, oh
Uh, do her...
Gettin' a little nasty in here
Mm
My baby is so nasty
She knows just what to do
My hard-on's everlasting
Red emotion, never blue

Feline keep my body workin'
Feline
Feline orgasma-jerkin'
Feline

My baby so, so sexy
She likes when her kitty's wet
Last climax was so taxing
She says, "U ain't seen nothin' yet"

Feline keep my body workin'
Feline
Feline orgasma-jerkin'
Feline

Feline
My baby is so nasty
She knows just what to do
My hard-on's everlasting
Red emotions, never blue

Feline

Oh mama, don't do that
Help me

Uh

Pleasure kitten, sex machine
Naked body, oh, so mean

Sex machine, you're too funky

St. Paul's my name, makin' love's my game, funky as I wanna be
Line up a hundred and I swear to God
I'll pump you til' you just can't see
If I start an ocean or n dry land
Most women say I'm a helluva man
And when I come, it's not bye-bye
I won't give up till the river run dry
I ain't braggin', I got a foot long
And when I use it, it's never wrong
Sleepin' pills will knock you out
St. Paul know what it's all about
I'm bad, good God, funky as I wanna be
Line up a hundred and I swear to God
I'll pump you till you just can't see
Mass appeal and little boy smile
I'll keep you happy, baby, all the while
I'm the one to fill the gap
If you got the tree, I got the sap
I'm bad, good God, badder than the wicked witch
I'll pet ur kitty, ur little dog too, don't you wanna be my bitch?
Ruff
Look out now
Hmph, I'm bad, good God, funky as I wanna be

In the distance
An entrance
I know it's mine
Someday I will touch it
'Cause it calls me
Since you crossed the line
Cross the line
I know everything's not always as it seems
So I pinch myself daily just in case it's just a dream
Man walks by
My spirit's my gift
And I hold it safe

[Verse 1]
Funny that you should call
I was just sittin' by the telephone
Lookin' for a remedy
For all my misery

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry for what I said
It's just that I didn't think our first date should be in bed
I wanna let you be the one
But you oughta know I'm lookin' for a girl
That'll want me for more than one night of fun

[Chorus]
If I love you tonight
Promise me that you'll stay with me 'til the morning light
Baby, can you stay until the morning light?
Talk to me, tell me a story
Just tell me you'll hold me tight
Hold me
If I love you tonight

[Verse 3]
I want you, this is true
When you looked at me I knew
I knew
This ain't no matter of pride
No no
It's just that when tomorrow comes
I want you here by my side

[Chorus]
If I love you tonight
Swear to me that you'll stay with me 'til the morning light
Baby, can you stay until the morning light, ooh ohh?
Talk to me, tell me a story
Just tell me you'll hold me tight
Hold me
If I love you tonight

[Bridge]
I'm lookin' for a girl
She don't have to be pure
She just gotta be sho'nuff secure
Sho'nuff secure
If you want a lover, I'm the remedy
I am the remedy, the remedy
But girl, you gotta tell me what you gonna do for me
What you gonna do, what you gonna do for me?

[Chorus]
If I love you tonight
Promise me that you'll stay with me
Until the morning light
Say that you'lll stay until the morning light?
Talk to me, tell me a story
Just tell me you'll hold me tight
Hold me, hold me

I'll drive you to work, girl
I'll treat you right
Promise me that you'll stay with me 'til the morning light
If I love you tonight
If I love you tonight

[Outro]
Oh yeah, baby
I wanna give you my love
But you gotta promise me
(If I love you tonight)

Uh, yeah baby
(If I love you tonight)
Uh, just like that, yeah
Ah, yeah
Right there
Can it be in this seemingly short space of time
We've lived a year or two inside our minds?
Now I want to whisper in your ear that you're OK

If love were gold then I would be fixed for life
If I was a star, then baby, you would be the night
And I want to live my whole life through inside of you

Darling, it seems I have found the grand progression
Whenever I'm in your arms
From July until June, every sun and every moon
Melting inside your charms

If there really is a God up above
To Him I owe my life for you, my love
Now darling, if I died yesterday
It's OK

Darling, it seems I have found the grand progression
Whenever I'm in your arms
From July until June, every sun and every moon
Melting inside your charms
Darling, it seems I have found the grand progression
Whenever I'm in your arms
From July until June, every sun and every moon
Melting inside your charms

Can it be in this seemingly short space of time
We've lived a year or two inside our minds?
Now I want to whisper in your ear that you're OK
When the sands of time are running out
When the voice of opression screams and shouts
When all seems lost, you've got to try
To never let your spirit die

An angel came to greet me
It happened in a dream
He spoke of my reality
Not being what it seems

Within us lives a new world
This world, he calmly said
Will only be when evil and
All its sorrows are truly dead, whoa

When the sands of time are running out
(Spirit)
When the voice of oppression screams and shouts
(Spirit)
When all seems lost, you got to try
(Spirit)
To never let your spirit die
(Never let your spirit die)

You cannot accept deception
And real love will never lie
We must try to be the chosen few
And keep that love alive
(Keep that love alive)

Yeah, we will never be unfulfilled, no
And your deck will be full of aces
’Cause, whenever the spirit wills
We can go to higher places (oh-oh)

When the sands of time are running out
(Spirit)
When the voice of oppression screams and shouts
(Spirit)
When all seems lost, you got to try
(Spirit)
To never let your spirit die

(Hey, hey, yeah, yeah)

(Spirit)

(Hey, hey, yeah, yeah)
(Spirit)

[Rap]
You got to view this world
Through kaleidoscopic eyes
You got to see every color
If you want to see the reasons why

An angel came to greet me
It happened in a dream
He spoke of my reality
Not being what it seems
Within us lives the new world
This world, he calmly said
Will only be when evil and
All it's sorrows are truly dead

Spirit, spirit, spirit, spirit, yeah!

When the time is running out
When the voice of oppression screams and shouts
(Spirit)
When all seems lost, you got to try
To never let your spirit die

Never, never, never, never
When the sands of time are running out
(Spirit)
When the voice of oppression screams and shouts
(Spirit)
When all seems lost, you got to try
(Spirit)
To never let your spirit die

When the sands of time are running out
(Spirit)
When the voice of oppression screams and shouts
(Spirit)
When all seems lost, you got to try
(Spirit)
To never let your spirit die
(Spirit)

Don't ever give up
How did it come 2 this?
U livin' in your world and me dyin' in mine
Lord knows I don't deserve this
I never gave U any reason 2 treat me unkind
Each day that goes by I grow lonelier
Sadder than the day before
I'd give anything just 2 hold U in my arms
Or see U standin' at my door

Cuz darlin', U mean more than words could explain
Ooh darlin', the pain, it cuts so deep

And it's only a matter of time
Before I go right out of my mind
I don't care who was wrong
I only know that when U're gone
I think about U every day
Why'd U have 2 go away and leave me all alone?
Won't U please come home, baby?
Come home
Why did we ever part?
U were my lover and I was your friend
How did this argument start?
Couldn't we just kiss and start over again?
Whoever said all good things soon come 2 an end
Never had anybody like U
There's a pounding in the pit of my heart
Whenever I think of what we used 2 do
(Ooh, the things we use 2 do)

Cuz U mean more than words could explain
Darlin', darlin', the pain cuts so deep

It's only a matter of time
'Fore I go right out of my mind
I don't care who was wrong
I only know that when U're gone
I think about U every day
Why'd U have 2 go away, leave me all alone?
Won't U please come home, baby?
(Baby, won't U please come home? I don't wanna be alone)
I can't take it no more
Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby

Looky here
I got somethin' I wanna say
U know I never treated U bad
U know I was the best U ever had
I know it's just a matter of time
'Fore I go right out of my mind
Ow!
Baby, help me
Oh baby

It's just a matter of time before I go right out of mind
I don't care who was wrong, baby
All I know, all I know is that when U're gone
I say when U're gone
I think about it every day any old kind of way
Why'd U leave me, why'd U leave me?
Why'd U go away?
Baby, baby, won't U come home?

(Baby, won't U please come home? I don't wanna be alone)
Come on, come on home
Help me – come on, come on home
(Baby, won't U please come home? I don't wanna be alone) {fade out}
Somebody help me
Come on, come on home
Are you living, are you living, are you living 2 die
Are you living, are you living, are you living to
Look at how we're living, look at how we're living
Look at how we're living our lives
Is this really living, are we really living
Look at how we're living to die

Mamas raising boys to men
17 and young one day
She wants for them what she don't have
Baby keeps on nibbling, brother keeps on being bad
Who told you, that this is what...
Showing that mama, she's left feeling sad
When the news comes, better have some
Better than being on the wrong side of the gun, ooh

Look at how we're living, look at how we're living
Look at how we're living our lives

Candy's watching videos
Thinking that's how love goes
You give it up, a beat called a tune
Now she got a couple of babies and a ...
Look at how we're living, look at how we're living
Look at how we're living our lives
Is this really living, are we really living
Look at how we're living to die


And children did you believe like I
That only natural human rite is to be paralyzed
Don't let the sunset on the dawn
Come on rise, baby, rise it's gonna be alright

Look at how we're living, check out how we're living
Are you living, are you living, are you living
Just wanna say, 2 wrongs never make a right
The only victims here are you and I baby

Look at how we're living, look at how we're living, hey
Look at how we're living, look at how we're living
Look at how we're living our lives
Is this really living, are we really living
Look at how we're living to die

Look at how we're living, look at how we're living in
Look at how we're living our lives
Is this really living, are we really living in
Look at how we're living to die
Look at how we're living, look at how we're living
Check your world y'all, we are
Hidden on the side of the pool
Facin' the sun
Ignoring the fool drinkin' Scotch on the rocks
Ignoring every1
She lowered her book
Took off her sunglasses
That's when the fool laughed aloud
4 N his eyes, she was so fine
Dark, mysterious & proud

Her name was Scarlett
& the scarf was red
There's nowhere 2 hide
When it's all N ur mind
There's nowhere 2 hide
When it's all N ur mind (Oh)

She smiled & another cube of ice
Appeared right then N the glass
Like a camera lens
He panned her body but stopped
When he reached the last drop of Scotch
He decided she was n2 no 1
When she coolly went back 2 her book
N the light of the sun (Look at me...)
Her body commanded his every look
Her name was Scarlett
& the scarf was red
There's nowhere 2 hide
When it's all N ur mind
There's nowhere 2 hide
When it's all N ur mind (Oh)

Conversation with others seemed worthless
So he dived N the pool 2 find
A place 2 hide from the thought of her
4 right there N the back of his mind
Was Scarlett
Yeah
N the pool she dived

Time & all creation stood still (Ooh)
Their eyes met 4 a 2nd longer than it took
4 them 2 fall N love against each other's will

Her name was Scarlett
& she fell N love
Nowhere 2 hide
When it's all N ur mind

The words on the page looked prettier
Prettier N the afternoon sun
Lost N the fantasy
Ignoring all the fools
Ignoring every1
She lowered her book
Took off her sunglasses & said...
Her name was Scarlett
& the scarf was red
There's nowhere 2 hide
When it's all N ur mind
There's nowhere 2 hide (Scarlett)
When it's all N ur mind
All N ur mind (Nowhere 2 hide) (Scarlett)
All N ur mind (It's all N ur mind)
Her name was Scarlett
& the scarf was red
Hear what I said?

[Verse 1]
They told him, "Don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it (Woo!)
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man (Woo!)
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

[Chorus]

Just beat it (Beat it)
Just beat it (Beat it, uh)

[Verse 2]
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it (Woo!)
You have to show them that you're really not scared (Woo!)
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare (Woo!)
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

[Chorus]

No one wants to be defeated (Oh Lord)
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight

No one wants to be defeated
She was more like a beauty queen
From a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean
I am the one. Who will dance
On the floor
In the round. She said I am the one
Who will dance
On the floor
In the round. She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes
That dreamed of being the one. Who will dance
On the floor
In the round. People always told me
Be careful of what you do. And don’t go around
Breaking young girls' hearts. And mother always told me
Be careful of who you love. And be careful of what you do
Cause the lie becomes the truth. Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl
Who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
Law was on her side
But who can stand when she’s in demand
Her schemes and plans. Go dance on
On the floor
In the round. So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(do think twice)
She told my baby
We'll dance till 3: 00
And she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cries
His eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
Go dance
On the floor
In the round
People always told me
Be careful of what you do
And don't go around
Breaking young girls hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of her sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room. Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl
Who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl
Who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son. She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl
Who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
She says he is my son
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover

I took my baby to the doctor
With a fever, but nothing he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown

[Verse 1]
Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain’t nothin' that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine

[Pre-Chorus]
You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

[Chorus]
I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
We're gonna rock the night away
Mhm

[Verse 2]
Out on the floor
There ain’t nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love
Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go

[Pre-Chorus]
When you feel that heat
And we're gonna ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

[Chorus]
I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
We're gonna rock the night away

You know that love survives
So we can rock forever on

I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you

I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you

I wanna rock (All night) with you, girl (Sunlight)
Rock with you, rock with you, yeah (All night)

Feel the heat, feel the beat (All night)
Rock you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock (All night)
Rock the night away

[Verse 1]
Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

[Verse 2]
Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

[Bridge]
Oh, whisper three words and I'll come running
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

[Chorus]
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone (You are not alone)
I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (Though you're far away, you and me)
I am here to stay
But you are not alone (You are always in my heart)
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone (You are not alone)

[Intro]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
Don't worry what people say, we know the truth
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
Enough is enough of this garbage
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Verse 1]
Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Verse 2]
Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me
Jew me, sue me, everybody do me
Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me, what has become of my life?
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am the victim of police brutality, now
I'm tired of being the victim of hate
You're ripping me of my pride, oh, for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy, set me free

[Verse 3]
Skinhead, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Trepidation, speculation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Black male, blackmail, throw the brother in jail

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Post-Chorus]
Tell me, what has become of my rights?
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty, now
I'm tired of being the victim of shame
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know, I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

[Verse 4]
Skinhead, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Situation, speculation, everybody, litigation
Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me
Hit me, kick me, you can never get me

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Bridge]
Some things in life
They just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

[Verse 5]
Skinhead, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Situation, segregation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Kick me, kike me, don't you wrong or right me

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

[Verse 1]
I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feeling insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittling me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me

[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

[Verse 2]
Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was dogging me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came and again, and again, and again
Take my name and just let me

[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

[Outro]
Like a stranger in Moscow
Lord have mercy
Like a stranger in Moscow
Lord have mercy
We're talking danger
We're talking danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
We're talking danger
We're talking danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
I'm living lonely
I'm living lonely, baby
Stranger in Moscow

[KGB interrogator - Russian to English Translation]
Why have you come from the West
Confess, to steal the great achievements of the people
The accomplishments of the worker

[Intro]
Keep movin'

[Verse 1]
He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot wheeled in the place
Keep daring to motivate
He say one day you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fire's deep in his eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land?
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan?
Everybody sing

[Chorus]
Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Keep movin'
K-k-keep movin'

[Verse 2]
Don't let no one get you down
Keep movin' on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history

[Pre-Chorus]
How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land?
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand?
Everybody sing

[Chorus]
Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history (History)
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry (Chivalry)
Every child should sing together in harmony
Keep movin'
K-k-keep movin'

[Bridge]
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world
History
History

[Pre-Chorus]
How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land?
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And be a family? Oh

[Chorus]
Every day create your history
(History)
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
(Legacy)
Every soldier dies in his glory
(His glory)
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
(And liberty, now)
Every day create your history
(History)
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
All around the world we sing
Every child should sing together in harmony

[Verse 1]
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?

There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

Are you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by—
You've been hit by a smooth criminal
OW

[Verse 2]
So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats intimidations

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by—
You've been struck by a smooth criminal
OW

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
(Annie, are you okay?)
I don't know
(Will you tell us, that you're okay)
I don't know
(There's a sound at the window)
I don't know
(That he struck you a crescendo, Annie)
I don't know
(He came into your apartment)
I don't know
(Left the bloodstains on the carpet)
I don't know
(And then you ran into the bedroom)
I don't know
(You were struck down, it was your doom, Annie)
Daggone it
(Annie, are you okay?)
Daggone it, Annie
(Will you tell us, that you're okay)
Daggone it, baby
(There's a sound at the window)
Daggone it, Annie
(That he struck you a crescendo, Annie)
Woo, woo

Daggone it
(Left the bloodstains on the carpet)
Woo, woo

Daggone it
(You were struck down, it was your doom)

[Verse 2]
In time I knew that love would bring
This happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I waited patiently
Girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think that I (Oh)
Have finally found the perfect love I searched for all my life

And girl, I know that this is love
I feel the magic all in the air
And girl, I'll never get enough
That's why I always have to have you here, hoo

[Chorus]
You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know you did
And everything I own I give (Look what you did to me, baby, yeah)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)

[Verse 1]
Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend
Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

[Verse 2]
Weary
Tell me, will you hold me?
When wrong, will you scold me?
When lost will you find me?
But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight 'til the end
But I'm only human

[Bridge]
Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused, will you show it to me?
That you'll be there for me and care enough to bear me

[Outro: The Andraé Crouch Singers & (Michael Jackson)]
Hold me
(Show me)
Lay your head lowly
(Told me)
Softly then boldly
(Yeah)
Carry me there
(I'm only human)
Lead me
(Hold me)
Love me and feed me
(Yeah, yeah)
Kiss me and free me
(Yeah)
I will feel blessed
(I'm only human)
Carry
(Carry)
Carry me boldly
(Carry me)
Lift me up slowly
(Yeah)
Carry me there
(I'm only human)
Save me
(Lift me)
Heal me and bathe me
(Lift me up, lift me up)
Softly you say to me
I will be there
(I will be there)
Lift me
Lift me up slowly
Carry me boldly
(Yeah)
Show me you care
Hold me
(Woo)
Lay your head lowly
(It gets lonely sometimes)
Softly then boldly
(I get lonely, yeah, yeah)
Carry me there
(Carry me there)
Need me
(Woo)
Love me and feed me
(Lift me up, hold me up)
Kiss me and free me
(Lift me up sometimes, up sometimes)
I will feel blessed
(Yeah)

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Verse 2]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Outro]
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, going to miss me when I'm gone
Going to miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse]
All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

Tell me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain

If you hear that same sweet song again
Will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet
Is passing by

Laugh in the sunshine
Sing
Cry in the dark
Fly
Through the night
Don't cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
Anymore
La-la-la-la
Sleep
In the stars
Don't you cry
Dry your eyes on the wind
La-la-la-la
La...

[Verse 1]
Look out of any window
Any morning, any evening, any day
Maybe the sun is shining
Birds are winging or rain is falling from a heavy sky

[Chorus 1]
What do you want me to do
To do for you to see you through?
For this is all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon, long ago

[Verse 2]
Walk out of any doorway
Feel your way, feel your way like the day before
Maybe you'll find direction
Around some corner where it's been waiting to meet you

[Chorus 2]
What do you want me to do
To watch for you while you are sleeping?
Then please don't be surprised
When you find me dreaming, too

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Look into any eyes you find by you
You can see clear through to another day
Maybe it's been seen before through other eyes
On other days while going home

[Chorus 3]
What do you want me to do
To do for you, to see you through?
It's all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon, long ago

[Verse 4]
Walk into splintered sunlight
Inch your way through dead dreams to another land
Maybe you're tired and broken
Your tongue is twisted with words half spoken and thoughts unclear

[Chorus 4]
What do you want me to do
To do for you, to see you through?
A box of rain will ease the pain
And love will see you through

[Verse 5]
Just a box of rain
Wind and water
Believe it if you need it
If you don't, just pass it on
Sun and shower, ind and rain
In and out the window like a moth before a flame

[Outro]
And it's just a box of rain
I don't know who put it there
Believe it if you need it
Or leave it if you dare
And it's just a box of rain
Or a ribbon for your hair
Such a long long time to be gone
And a short time to be there

[Verse 1]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 2]
1920 when he stepped to the bar
Drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar
1930 when the wall caved in
He made his way selling red-eyed gin

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 3]
Delilah Jones was the mother of twins
Two times over, and the rest were sins
Raised eight boys, only I turned bad
Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Bridge]
Tumble down shack on Big Foot county
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in
Delilah Jones went to meet her God
And the old man never was the same again

[Verse 4]
Daddy made whiskey and he made it well
Cost two dollars and it burned like hell
I cut hick'ry just to fire the still
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 5]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me?"

[Outro]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, yeah, yeah
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Verse 1]
Going where the climate suits my clothes
I'm going where the climate suits my clothes
Going where the climate suits my clothes
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Well I'm goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Verse 2]
Going where the water tastes like wine
Well I'm going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Outro]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way
Well I'm goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
I don't want to be treated this a-way

[Verse 1]
I went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up into heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
Get prepared, there's going to be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, Hey! Saturday Night!
One more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night!

[Verse 2]
Everybody's dancing down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, the whole place going to fly

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Turn on Channel Six, the President comes on the news
Says, "I got no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues
His wife say "Don't get crazy, Lord, you know what to do
Crank up that old Victrola, put on your rocking shoes

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought he'd have a big old party, thought he'd call it Planet Earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord, you'll know it when it comes
When the rock and roll music meets the rising, shining sun

[Chorus x2]
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
(How you made me feel)
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
(How you made me feel)
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo

I don't remember what you said, but I remember how you made me feel (Yeah)
I like my dollars like cement
Walk all over it and you see how it feels

Forgive me
Give me, now
Forgive me
Give me, now

Remember what you said
Don’t remember how you made me feel

Kiss me, pixel daddy (Oh)
Get up in the day (Oh)
No one's more than you are (What you want)
Do you want a babe?
Do you want a babe?
Do you want a babe?
Do you want a.. baby?

I don't remember what you said
But I remember how you made me feel
(Remember how you made me feel)
I like my dollars like cement
Walk all over it and you see how it feels

Forgive me
Give me, now
Forgive me
Give me, now

Remember what you said
Don’t remember how you made me feel
(Remember it)

[Verse]
I've been fucking with them fizzy pink juices

Come into my waiting room, she wait until she beg for it
They wanna underestimate me cause they unqualified

But you would rather hand me this shit

[Outro]
Doja

[Verse 1]
Wake of the flood, laughing water, forty-nine
Get out the pans, don't just stand there dreaming
Get out the way, get out the way

[Chorus]
Here comes sunshine
Here comes sunshine

[Verse 2]
Line up a long shot
Maybe try it two times, maybe more
Good to know you got shoes to wear when you find the floor
Why hold out for more?

[Chorus]
Here comes sunshine
Here comes sunshine

[Verse 3]
Asking you nice, now
Keep the mother rolling one more time
Been down before but you just don't have to go no more, no more

[Chorus]
Here comes sunshine
Here comes sunshine

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nuthatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Verse 2]
There comes a redeemer
And he slowly too fades away
There follows a wagon behind him
That's loaded with clay
And the seeds that were silent
All burst into bloom and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
And sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Verse]
A pistol shot at 5 o'clock
The bells of heaven ring
Tell me what you done it for
No, I won't tell you a thing
Yesterday I begged you
Before I hit the ground
All I leave behind me
Is only what I found
If you can abide it
Let the hurdy-gurdy play
Stranger ones have come by here
Before they flew away
I will not condemn you
Nor yet would I deny
I would ask the same of you
But failing will not die
Take up your china doll
It's only fractured
And just a little nervous
From the fall

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust to nothing
But i know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh i hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just look to see the sights
I can tell your future
Look what's in your hand
But i can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a turning
While i'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Outro]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak daybreak on the land

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you know my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
And never could do no wrong
You had everything sewed up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you know my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Verse 3]
Well, in spite of all you gained
You still had to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you know my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Bridge]
Well shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
If that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, is just one thing for me
Please forget you know my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me

[Chorus 1]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus 2]
Now, he's gone, now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone, like a steam locomotive
Rolling down the track, he's gone, he's gone
And nothin's going to bring him back, he's gone

[Verse 1]
Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride
Hot as a pistol but cool inside
Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile
Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
Going where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
Lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

[Chorus 2]
Same old, rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus 2]
Ne

[Outro]
Like a steam locomotive
Rolling down the track, he's gone, he's gone
And nothing's going to bring him back, he's gone
Ooh, nothing's going to bring him back

[2x]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

Dallas, got a soft machine;
Houston, too close to New Orleans;
New York's got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no

Most of the cats that you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they gotta get goin'
Out of the door and down to the street all alone

Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay'em down
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

Truckin', up to Buffalo
Been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
Takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowlin' pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, oh no

You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

Truckin', I'm a goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now get back truckin' home
The other day they waited
The sky was dark and faded
Solemnly they stated
"He has to die
You know he has to die"

And all the children learning
From books that they were burning
Every leaf was turning
To watch him die
You know he has to die

The summer sun looked down on him
His mother could but frown on him
And all the other sound on him
But it doesn't seem to matter

And when the day had ended
With rainbow colors blended
His mind remained unbended
He had to die
You know he had to die
Spanish lady come to me
She lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round
It trembles and explodes

It left a smoking crater of my mind
I like to blow away
But the heat came ‘round and busted me
For smiling on a cloudy day

Coming, coming, coming around (coming around)
Coming around in a circle (coming around)
Coming (coming), coming (coming), coming around (coming around)
Coming around in a circle (coming around)

Escaping through the lily fields
I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded
Left a bus stop in its place

The bus came by and I got on
That's when it all began
There was cowboy Neal at the wheel
Of a bus to never-ever land

Coming, coming, coming around (coming around)
Coming around in a circle (coming around)
Coming (coming), coming (coming), coming around (coming around)
Coming around in a circle (coming around)
And when the day had ended
With rainbow colors blended
His mind remained unbended
He had to die
You know he had to die

He had to die
You know he had to die

He had to die
Well, you know he had to die

[Verse]
Old man down, way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty, asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine, more than my maker, though he's no friend of mine
Everyone said, I'd come to no good, I knew I would pearly, believe them
Half of my life, I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The other half found me stumbling 'round drunk on burgundy wine
But I'll get back on my feet again someday
The good lord willing, if he says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should
I'll get up and fly away, I'll get up and fly away, fly away
Pearly's been true, true to me, true to my dying day he said
I said to him, I said to him, "I'm sure she's been."
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you."
Got up and wandered, wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just hang around
I've got a girl, named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me
On the first day of Christmas, the police sent to me, a S.W.A.T team in a pear tree

On the twelfth day of Christmas, the police sent to me, (mumbling) twelve days in the county jail, man fuck the 12 Days of Christmas, we gotta come up with some other Christmas songs!
A-FRO-MAN, take a pound of bud and flip it like a pancake. PACAW!

I quit my job this mornin'
I don't want to work no more
Fuck MacDonald's and Taco Bell
That modern day slavery is knockin' on my front door
(I don't fit in the corporate world man)
Get you a big fat sack o' yayo
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my dog-on life
Hungry hustlas

(Afroman)
Got hired at the dope spot
I'm an employee
Cookin' crack like a black Chef Boyardee
Got Meth, speed, whatever you need
Zigzags come free with a bag of weed
If You want some sherm, ye got to talk to herm
The skinny black dude with the real long perm
Laptop computers, rap CDs, Motorola phones, Sony color TVs
Got the porno tapes in the back of the car, get it free when you buy a hot VCR
Got gats and D's, car batteries
Getting money with my folks on a hundred spokes
Cops ain't waiters, we don't tip em
Treat cars like women take 'em home and strip em
Match the pink slips, get the smog inspection
Put a add in the paper in the classified section
'Cause I don't want to work no more
(Fuck that shit)
Modern day slavery knocking on my front door
(Fuck that shit)
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my own life
'Cause I don't want to work no more
Modern day slavery knockin' on my front door
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my damn life motherfucker
(Melody)
I quit my job this morning'
I don't want to work no more
Fuck MacDonald's and Taco Bell
Modern day slavery is knocking on my front door
Get you a big fat sack of yayo
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my dog-on life
Tell the Neighborhood watch, tell the Neighborhood listen
Tell the neighborhood ya big screen television missin'
New in my hood, I got to come to ya
Steal ya car battery and sell it back to ya
Then I come back, just for kicks
I leave ya car sitin' on four big bricks
All I need now is some baskets homes
'Cause my garage looks just like auto zone
What you say man? Ya need another beeper?
Buy from me, 'cause it's a whole lot cheaper
Got a cellular phone, and ya really oughta get it
Fo a limited time, brother, the chip come wit it
So come to my house, when the times is hard
It's just like Vegas in my back yard
I keep my Afro pick, my khakis creased
And my next-door neighbors callin up the police
'Cause I don't want to work no more
Modern day slavery knockin' on my front door
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my own life
I said 'cause I don't want to work no more
Modern day slavery knockin' on my front door
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my damn life
(Melody)

Rough, reckless, snatch yo necklace
Sell it on the corner and buy myself breakfast
I made in an hour or more
So what the fuck do I want to get job for?
So the yuppies the guppies, can floss their power
My black ass five dollas an hour
And the fact is, after taxes, got to live
Where the Mexicans and the blacks is mother fucker
Crooked police, gangs in chuck tailors
Bums sleeping in fuckin' trucks and trailers
Three hundred dollors every two weeks
From the stupid, tired, penny pinching pencil neck geeks
Abraham Lincoln told me I was free
So ima walk to corner and do what I want to
While you at work I'll be watchin cable
Wit ya girl dancin' naked on my new pool table
I don't want to work no more
Modern day slavery knockin' on my front door
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my own life
Said I don't want to work no more
Modern day slavery knockin' on my front door
Can't see my kids can't see...
Ah man I got to sell like a twenty dollear rock, y'all keep singing, I'll be right back
(Melody)
I quit my job this morning'
I don't want to work no more
Fuck MacDonald's and Taco Bell, modern day slave rails
Is knocking on my front door
Get you a big fat sack of yayo
Can't see my kids can't see my wife
Can't see a way to control my dog-on life
Me and Strainj just got off work
Hit the liquor store to erk and jerk
Go back home, grap a cup
Put a tape in, turn the stereo up
Start smokin'
Start sippin'
Start laughin'
Start trippin'
The gangsta house on the block
Stereo bumpin' with major knock
Crazy G's
Rollin' D's
Pull into the side, shoot the breeze
Smoke some weed, drink some brew
Sell a CD, make a dollar too
Crack some jokes, discuss some plans
Push for time so we slappin' hands
He hopped in the car, let the Daytons twirl
Yeah
Fuck the corporate world
Drinkin' on the sidewalk
Oww
Dancin' while we talk
(Dancin' while we talk)
Hoppin' in the caddy
Glide like a chickenhawk
(Yeah)
I got off work, went to the club
The guy at the door charged me a dub
Stuck up bitches wouldn't dance, security guard pullin' up my pants
Macho niggas tryinna start a fight
Couldn't get the bartender all damn night
(*laughin*)Oh, the DJ was gay
He had a flat top like Kid And Play
And he was kissin' those bitches' asses
With the Urkel (?) pants and them Dwayne Wayne glasses
Whack rap music all night long
I didn't even hear one good song
Fuck the club, i'll stay home
System beat good in my Fleetwood Broug
Hit the liquor store, buy 4-0
Drinkin' on the sidewalk, you know?
Drinkin' on the sidewalk
Dancin' while we talk
Hoppin' in the caddy
(Zoop, zoop)
Glide like a chicken hawk
Drinkin' on the sidewalk
Dancin' while we talk
Hoppin' in the caddy
(Zoop, zoop, yeah)
Glide like a chicken hawk
Walk up drunk to a hoodrat, get her number just like that
She said she might not do nothing tonight
Told "Come through" and she said alright
Baby came through with the ghetto girls
Called up the homies with the Chucks and curls
Sent the hoodrats to the liquor store
Coz' nobody tryinna shoot them, you know
Waitin' on the bitches, rollin' blunts
Tonight we'll be pullin' major stunts
We got music, we got food
We got time to get 'em in the mood
Porch light off, dark in the front
All you can see is the light from the blunt
Every now and then, she dance
I dance with her while i sag my pants
Drinkin' on the sidewalk
Dancin' while we talk
Hoppin' in the caddy
Glide like a chicken hawk
Drinkin' on the sidewalk
Dancin' while we talk
Hoppin' in the caddy
Glide like a chicken hawk
Oww

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly, to fly

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I wish today it will rain all day
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
Trying to forgive you for abandoning me
Praying but I think I'm still an angel aways
Angel away, yeah strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got their guns out aiming at me
But I become near when they aiming at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start coming and I start rising
Must be surprising, I'm just surmising
I win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher
More fire

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly, to fly

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocating every time it locks me in
Paint they own pictures, then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that can ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
See we become alive in a time of fear
And I ain't got no time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard your nay's become yea's
Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly, to fly

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Get ready for it, get ready for it, get ready for it
I came to win
Get ready for it, get ready for it, get ready for it

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly, to fly

[Intro: All]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You can tell me what you want

[Verse 1: AJ, Brian & All]
Girl, you struck me like the sun
So just tell me how you wanna be done
I've known you a couple of weeks
You seem like you don't do stupid tricks
Sweetie, you are so beautiful
I can imagine you must feel wonderful
I like to know what I need to do
How to behave, oh
How to please you, I can't take it
Oh, come on! Let me feel those hips
You can tell me what you wanna do
If you want me to bring the freak outta you
So let me put my ego on the side
Whatever you wish, I ain't got no pride
Girl, I'll become your biggest fan
I could be your perfect man

[Chorus: All]
You can tell me what you want
You can tell me what you need
I will do whatever you want
Just don't ever make my heart bleed
Girl, don't you understand
That your wish is my command?
So baby, drop the mask
Show me what's the task
And tell me everything you want

[Verse 2: AJ, Brian & All]
Girl, you told me what was in the past
All the relationships that never last
No man ever let you be free
I know you're fed up with the jealousy
I'll give you all the freedom that you need
Baby, you and I will succeed
I like to know what I need to do
How to behave, oh
How to please you, I can't take it
Oh, come on! Let me kiss those lips
You can tell me what you wanna do
If you want me to bring the freak outta you
Don't want to violate the things
And make you mad
Don't want to violate the things
And make you sad
Let me just find it right here, pretty lady
Before we make a baby

[Chorus: All, (Brian) & AJ]
You can tell me what you want (tell me, girl)
You can tell me what you need (tell me what you need)
I will do whatever you want
Just don't ever make my heart bleed
(Don't make my heart bleed)
Girl, don't you understand (no, you don't)
That your wish is my command? (my command)
So baby, drop the mask
Show me what's the task
And tell me everything you want
You can tell me what you want (tell me, baby)
You can tell me what you need (tell me, girl)
I will do whatever you want (whatever you want)
Just don't ever make my heart bleed
Girl, don't you understand (no, you don't)
That your wish is my command? (yeah, yeah)
So baby, drop the mask (baby)
Show me what's the task (task)
And tell me everything you want

[Bridge: AJ, Nick & Brian]
What if we lose all the money, baby?
What if there's nothing but you and me?
Tell me what would you do, pretty lady
Would you at least take care of me?
You can tell me how you deal with stress
When everything becomes a big mess
Will you stay strong and fight it off
Or will you pack your shh... and take off?

[Interlude: All, (Brian) & AJ]
Spend your life with me, baby (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Spend your life with me, baby girl (spend your life)
Spend your life with me, baby
Spend your life with me, baby girl
Spend your life with me, baby
Spend your life with me, baby girl
(Spend your life with me, baby)
Spend your life with me, baby
Spend your life with me, baby girl

[Chorus: All, (AJ), Nick & Brian]
You can tell me what you want
You can tell me what you need
I will do whatever you want (tell me)
Just don't ever make my heart bleed
(Don't make it bleed)
Girl, don't you understand
That your wish is my command?
So baby, drop the mask
Show me what's the task
And tell me everything you want
(Come on, come on, baby)

[Outro: Brian, Nick & All]
Yeah, yeah
You can tell me what you want
Baby, oh! Yeah, come on

[Intro: Donda West]
"There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?
Or when my car is hooked up, know you wanna follow me
Your laws are minimal
‘Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
This has got to cease
‘Cause we be getting hyped to the sound of the police
Now here's one little truth, open your eye
While you're checkin' out the boom box, check out the exercise
Take the word, 'Overseer,' like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew, for example
Overseer, overseer, overseer, overseer
Officer, officer, officer, officer, yeah
Officer from overseer
You need a little clarity? Check out the similarity
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off, patrollin' all the nation
The overseer could stop you from what you're doing
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuin'
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, he had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back, he'll put a hole in your chest
Woop, they both ride horses
After four hundred years," says KRS-One
I have no choices

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Blood of the Lamb
Can I hear me a little bit louder?
They will overcome

[Verse: Kanye West & Consequence]
The Devil is usin' you, confusin' you
Our job is to understand who is who
Righteous indignation in this nation
We gon' start a revolution in this basement
And at the end of the day, it's truly blessings
Y'all had your statistics and all them goofy questions
Y'all had your fake leaders, don't worry, we got it
And plus it's only twenty-one days to break a habit
Momma, I need you to tuck me in
I done made some mistakes and they rubbed it in (Boy)
I know you and grandma had enough for them (Boy)
Why I gotta be so stubborn then? (Boy)
I'm doin' this one for y'all
So we could end racism once and for all
How many prisons they gon' make? (Uh) Watch the safe
One hand wash the other, both hands wash the face

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time
It's time for me to move on
So fuck you and goodbye
I gave you love and I hate it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, all of the time that I wasted (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
It's the last time I let you hurt me
Fuck you, goodbye, I did not deserve it
None of this bullshit was ever really worth it
You blame me like I know I ain't perfect
I tried with you, and I lied for you
Many times, put my life on the line for you
I really wanted to get it right with you
I always saw the better side of you
And now it's fuck you for life
I'm doin' better, you right
I was wrong 'bout you, I guess I finally realized
You brought the dark to my light
I'm with a new one tonight
But there is one last thing I want to tell you tonight

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time
It's time for me to move on
So fuck you and goodbye
I gave you love and I hate it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, all of the time that I wasted (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Wait, that was a lie
Because I cannot erase you like eternal sunshine in a spotless mind
Red in the eyes, lately I've been on a cocaine diet
I've been tryin' to feed my high
Your things are still in the box that you left in the bedroom
You'll leave, and I'm here
With no heart, guess I'll be dead soon
Ghost in a shell, stoned like a cemetery
Scars don't heal, I got these in February
Broke your spell, love is only temporary
Highway to hell, I'm hangin' out the roof, yellin'

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI, Machine Gun Kelly & Both]
Fuck you, goodbye (Yeah)
You hurt me, for the last time
It's time for me to move on
So fuck you and goodbye
I gave you love and I hate it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, all of the time that I wasted (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck you, goodbye
You hurt me, for the last time

Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Yeah, ring, ring, ring

[Chorus]
I just wanna wake up from this nightmare
You'd be standing right there
Just the way you did before
I don't wanna waste another night here
When I know that you're out there
You ain't coming back, no more
Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Yeah oh yeah, oh-oh-oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Don't give up, on me
(Hahaha, Nick, you're stupid)

[Chorus]
Don't give up on me
I finally tried again, but I can never find no peace
Sometimes I fuck up, it's on me
I try and try again, but I still end up lonely, it's on me
I got friends that ain't my friends I ain't even know exist (Shit)
I got hoes that ain't my hoes, they just coexist
But with every entertainer up in Hollywood, I'm over it
That's why I pour a cup and get fucked up
I'm trying to forget it

[Verse]
Fuck that put that to the side now
I heard you want to fuck cause I'm up now
Shit, well, okay I'm with it, but only if you don't tell...
Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Better with you today
Oh, this way, this way

[Verse]
Self-reflecting, can't find love in Hollywood, had to learn that lesson
I might have a better shot gettin' back all my exes from Texas
Send her a message, only when I'm drunk, shit is pathetic
Keep on playin' with her heart, knowing I'm not ready
For that relationship shit, I'm just tryna get this money
Before I had it, I know that none of these bitches love me
Now Katy text me every night, talkin' about, "Come and fuck me"
And she keep on saying she put no one above me (Haha)
Yeah, aight

[Chorus]
I know about all the shit you gettin' up to late at night
I know about all the other rappers that be on your mind
I hate that all the time, but baby it's alright
I'm good, I'm straight, you don't gotta lie
...

[Verse 1]
You taste like honey, all warm and runny
Kinder than a candy, effervescent shandy
Days are ever sweeter when I wake up near ya
The world we're in is broken and you're the magic potion

[Pre-Chorus]
Like the wind on a sail, I'll steer you along
And the germs outside I'll keep you from
Like the hail in the morn, I'll sing you a song
While the mead I make can brew for you

[Chorus]
You taste like honey
You taste like honey
You taste like honey
You taste like honey

[Verse 2]
Life is what you do in it while you're floating through it
Cut the rope some slack then while we get the knack of it
We're endless motion, drink to that notion
Buoyant is your spirit, gotta keep me near it

[Pre-Chorus]
Like the wind on a sail, I'll steer you along
And the germs outside I'll keep you from
Like the hail in the morn, I'll sing you a song
While the mead I make can brew for you

[Chorus]
You taste like honey
You taste like honey
You taste like honey
You taste like honey

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
You taste like honey
You taste like honey
You taste like honey
You taste like honey

[Verse 3]
Life is what you do in it while you're floating through it
Cut the rope some slack then while we get the knack of it
Days are ever sweeter when I wake up near ya
The world we're in is broken and you're the magic potion

[Verse 1: Howie]
Darkness falls
I thought I heard you call
Or was it just a dream
I'm a little scared
Knowing you're out there
So far away from me
It's been so long
Since you've been gone
Everyday I miss you more
Now I wanna know
Why did you have to go?
What were you looking for?

[Pre-Chorus 1: Howie]
And I hope you find your way
But I can't wait to say

[Chorus: Howie with All]
You're home now not alone now
These arms are hear to hold you
No need to be afraid
So come in 'cause I've been
Waiting for the moment
To open up this door
And I know that it's not much

[Post-Chorus: Howie, Kevin, Nick, (AJ) & Brian]
Welcome to my heart
Welcome to my heart
Welcome to my heart
(Welcome to my heart)
Welcome to my heart

[Verse 2: Howie]
So you lost your way
But that's yesterday
And I don't care where you've been
'Cause every step
You've taken since you left
Has brought you back again

[Pre-Chorus 2: Howie, Nick & AJ]
And I hope you see it clear
(Oh see it clear)
My love has always been right here
(I'll be right here)

[Chorus: Howie with All, AJ]
You're home now not alone now
These arms are hear to hold you
No need to be afraid (don't be afraid)
So come in 'cause I've been (I've been)
Waiting for the moment

Waiting for the moment
To open up this door (welcome to my heart)

Rock the night away

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)

It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
And too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
I took my baby to the doctor
With a fever, but nothing he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' you just wanna be startin' somethin'

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'

[Verse 2]
You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone's always tryin'
To keep my baby cryin'
Treacherous, cunnin', declinin'
You got my baby cryin'

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'

They eat off of you (They eat off of you)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
OW

[Verse 3]
Billie Jean is always talkin'
When nobody else is talkin'
Tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', spyin'
Sayin' you just wanna be startin' somethin'

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'

You'll be always tryin'
To stop that child from cryin'
Hustlin', stealin', lyin'
Now baby's slowly dyin'

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'

[Outro]
Lift your head up high
And scream out to the world
I know I am someone
And let the truth unfurl
No one can hurt you now
Because you know what's true
Yes, I believe in me
So you believe in you
Help me sing it

[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen
From a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean
I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don’t go around breaking young girls' hearts" (Hee)
And mother always told me, "A-be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do
'Cause the lie becomes the truth," hey, hey

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She’s just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (Woo)
She says I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son
(Hee hee hee, no no, hee hee hee, ooh)

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights
Law was on her side
But who can stand
When she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice, woo)
She told, "My baby, we'd danced 'til three"
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cry
His eyes looked like mine (Oh, no)
Do a dance on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee hee hee)

[Pre-Chorus]
A-people always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
(Don't break no hearts)
A-but she came and stood right by me
And just the smell of sweet perfume
And this happened much too soon
And she called me to her room, hey hey

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover (Woo)
She’s just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, hoo)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She’s just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son (No, no)
She says I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son
(Hee hee hee, hee, hee, hee - hee, hoo)

She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
(No, no, no, woo, hoo)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
(No one danced with me, baby)
But the kid is not my son
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no)
She says I am the one (No, babe)
But the kid is not my son (No, no, no)
She says I am the one
(You know what you did)
She says he is my son
(Breaking my heart, babe)
She says I am the one

[Outro]
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is the one
Don’t call me Billie Jean, woo
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is the one
She stumbled onto the scene, hee
Billie Jean is...
Billie Jean is...
Billie Jean is...
Hey, woo, ah baby, ah darlin', ah yeah, ooh, ooh, yeah
Ah baby, ah, darlin', ah baby, ooh, ah darlin', ooh
You know you can’t (Not my lover)
Hee, you know you can't (Not my lover)
Hee, ooh (Not my lover)
Ah (Not my lover)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is...
Billie Jean is...
Billie Jean is not my lover

[Chorus]
Sun is shining, the weather is sweet
Make you want to move your dancing feet
When the morning gathers the rainbow
Want you to know I'm a rainbow too
Want you to know I'm a rainbow too
To the rescue
Here I am
Want you to know just if you can where I stand

[Verse 1]
Sun is shining, the weather is sweet
Make you want to move your dancing feet
When the morning gathers the rainbow
Want you to know I'm a rainbow too
To the rescue
Here I am
Want you to know just if you can where I stand

[Chorus]
Sun is shining, the weather is sweet
Make you want to move your dancing feet
When the morning gathers the rainbow
Want you to know I'm a rainbow too
To the rescue
Here I am
Want you to know just if you can where I stand

[Outro]
Sun is shining
Sun is shining

[Intro]
I've been scared, I've been here before
I've been scared, I've been here before
I've been scared, I've been here before

[Pre-Chorus]
I-, I feel like we so disconnected lately
I don't know what changed but it ain't the same these days
We don't see eye to eye no more, like we used to
And I don't know what it is, but

[Chorus]
I think the problem is, you don't know how the deal with me
But I don't know how to deal with me either (Woah)
See I think the problem is, you don't know how the deal with me
But I don't know how to deal with me either (Woah)

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes, I get a little too in my thoughts
Sometimes, I get a little too in my feelings
Sometimes, I get a little too in my thoughts
Sometimes, I write a letter to you through a song

[Verse]
Lately I been thinkin' stupid
I can't do nothing without making excuses
I need some help, need your love, it is proven
To work on my body when no one else will do it, yeah
Love to talk, don't like to do shit, oh shit
I think that I stepped into some new shit, new shit
I think I just stepped into an ocean
The bad bitches, crooks and a bunch of fuckin' cool kids
It's bullshit, the way that it's portrayed
Stepped into the place, I don't even know the name
All I ever wanted was a little bit of fame
Now all I want is my mom and my friends, for real

[Bridge]
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But I, I feel like we so disconnected lately
I don't know what changed but it ain't the same these days
We don't see eye to eye no more, like we used to
And I don't know what it is, but

[Chorus]
I think the problem is, you don't know how the deal with me
But I don't know how to deal with me either (Woah)
See I think the problem is, you don't know how the deal with me
But I don't know how to deal with me either (Woah)

[Verse 1]
Staring at her, can't help it
Thinking 'bout her 'cause oh, my God she's beautiful
I can't believe she's mine, yeah
I only wanna be with her
Smile caught me at first sight
Is she even real?

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me why I'm feeling hazy
My thoughts are running wild, I'm shaky
Don't wanna waste her time, yeah
I never understood "Why me?" 'cause she's just so good
My God, she's beautiful

[Chorus]
I hope she loves me back (Back)
My heart would break if she don't
I hope she loves me back (Back)
My heart would break if she don't
I hope she loves me

[Verse 2]
Wonder if this is just a question of time
I'm here waiting for a sign
Want her to be by my side
But what if she finds out I'm a loser?
No, I don't wanna lose her to someone else
I hope she loves me

[Pre-Chorus]
Figure out how to ask her from the same page
Am I allowed to be thinkin' 'bout forever?
Don't wanna waste her time, yeah
I never understood "Why me?" 'cause she's just so good
My God, she's beautiful

[Chorus]
I hope she loves me back (Back)
My heart would break if she don't
I hope she loves me back (Back)
My heart would break if she don't
I hope she loves me

[Intro]
No me quiero ir

[Verse 1]
What do you mean?
You can't possibly be meaning the words that come out of your mouth
You wanna go home, but I just wanna have fun
You say that you're tired and want me to calm down
I was shy at first, but they welcomed me
There's way too many reasons to stay here
Just 'cause you want to, I don't think that it's fair
I'm putting my foot down, I'm staying here

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go home, I'm fine right here, leave me alone
'Cause I just wanna dance and be in the zone, eat some candy
Just leave me alone, 'cause I just wanna

[Verse 2]
Are you leaving now?
Are you serious?
The truth is that I don't wanna stay without you
And if we go, we'll miss it all
I'm sleepy too, I promise this will be worth it
(It's getting late) But I'm not nearly done
(I miss my bed) Let's hang out, come on
(Are you really sure you don't wanna come with us?)
Yeah

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go home, I'm fine right here, leave me alone
'Cause I just wanna dance and be in the zone, eat some candy
Just leave me alone, 'cause I just wanna

[Break]
¡Oye, Wachito!
Dime
Nos tenemo' que ir
¿Qué?
Nos tenemo' que ir
¿Se van ahora, al tiro?
Si pue', Brayan está bien cansado
¿En serio? Pero la estaba pasando bien po, quédense un poco más po hueón
Ah, tranqui, quédate
Yapo

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go home, I'm fine right here, leave me alone
'Cause I just wanna dance and be in the zone, eat some candy
Just leave me alone, 'cause I just wanna

[Verse 1]
All by myself, 4:30 AM
Why can't I sleep now?
I feel the urge to call you again
I know it's not real, just stuck on repeat
I'm sorry but I never intended
To put this weight on you

[Refrain]
But honey, I'm
Darling, I'm trying to get better

[Chorus]
I keep forgetting these things that are important to me
Darkness gets stuck on my mind, then I get blinded
I wish I could get a break so I can rest up
And I could finally see what really matters to me

[Verse 2]
Woke up again
What can I do to get my shit together?
I thought the nights were made for sleeping tight
They just blind my sight
In my head, a fight, such a waste of time
Yeah

[Chorus]
I keep forgetting these things that are important to me
Darkness gets stuck on my mind, then I get blinded
I wish I could get a break so I can rest up
And I could finally see what really matters to me

[Refrain]
But honey, I'm
Darling, I'm trying to get better
But darling, I'm
Honey, I'm trying to get better

[Verse 1]
I've been trying to take care of you
But nothing helps
Always tried to give my love to you
But you looked away

[Pre-Chorus]
You gave your eyes to someone else
What am I supposed to do?

[Chorus]
Te vas, te vas
Te vas, ¿por qué te vas?
Don't leave, don't leave
Don't leave, oh please, don't leave

[Verse 2]
Can we try to make this work for them? (Oh)
They don't understand (They don't understand)
Growin' up without a home, but two (Home)
It's up to us (Up to us, baby)

[Pre-Chorus]
I kinda thought we'd work this out (Work this out)
What am I supposed to do?

[Chorus]
Te vas, te vas
Te vas, ¿por qué te vas?
Don't leave, don't leave
Don't leave, oh please, don't leave

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Just think about the times
We used to share when love was there
Our hands, intertwined
That's when I knew that you were mine

[Outro]
Don't go, I love you so much, oh, babe
Don't go, I love you so much
Don't go, I love you so much, oh, baby
Don't go, I love you so much

[Verse 1]
It's late morning I'm right here in bed, oh yeah
Staring at the ceiling peacefully, it rains
The blanket's always comforting for days where I have to wait for you

[Chorus]
Come home I'll wait right here for you
To lay next to me, come home
Get back I'll wait right here for you
To lay next to me, come home

[Verse 2]
Time goes by I wish you weren't so far away
Clock is ticking I can't wait to see your face
To hear your voice is comforting on days where I have to wait for you

[Chorus]
Come home I'll wait right here for you
To lay next to me, come home
Get back I'll wait right here for you
To lay next to me, come home

[Bridge]
The blanket's always comforting
On days where I have to wait for you

[Chorus]
Come home I'll wait right here for you
To lay next to me, come home
Get back I'll wait right here for you
To lay next to me, come home

[Verse]
I dreamt I had a mustache
It was dope, I looked just like Tom Selleck
Was happy with myself
But sadly I woke up again
I think it's kinda wack
Twenty-one, still nothing under my nose
Except for when I sneeze
You know what I mean

[Chorus]
You can keep trying, oh-yeah
I've been patient for way too long
Keep hanging in there, oh-yeah
I will get there and prove 'em wrong

[Bridge]
Hijo, cuando yo era niño también quería tener bigotes
Y un hueón mayor me dijo: "Échate grasa de carretón y te salen"
Le hice caso, me llené la cara de grasa negra
Pero los bigotes me llegaron a los treinta nomás, compa

[Chorus]
You can keep trying, oh-yeah
I've been patient for way too long
Keep hanging in there, oh-yeah
I'll be trying until I cry

[Verse 1]
Last couple of days have been kind of grey
We've been slackin' around
Amor, we should get out of town
'Cause lately this has been drivin' me loco, I'm restless now
Ya no sé qué hacer, solo me quiero mover
A la disco tal vez, I just want us to have a good time
Amor, baila conmigo all night (Get down with me)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll show you how to dance, it's real easy
Mueve las caderas
Let the rhythm come and get you

[Chorus]
No puedes negarlo
Tú quieres bailar conmigo
Dame tu mano
Yo soy tu wachito rico

[Verse 2]
I'm holding you tight, won't let you out of my sight
Look into my eyes, y créeme cuando te digo:
"I could do this wherever, whenever, forever"

[Chorus]
No puedes negarlo
Tú quieres bailar conmigo
Dame tu mano
Yo soy tu wachito rico
Muévelo, show me that you're mine
Para siempre, baby
Dame tu mano
Yo soy tu wachito rico

[Bridge]
Get down with me
Get down with me
Eh, eh, eh
Get down with me
Eh, eh, eh
Get down
Haha, let me see you move
Check it out, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll show you how to dance, it's real easy
Mueve las caderas
Let the rhythm come and get you

[Chorus]
No puedes negarlo
Tú quieres bailar conmigo
Dame tu mano
Yo soy tu wachito rico
Muévelo, show me that you're mine
Para siempre, baby
Dame tu mano
Yo soy tu wachito rico
I'm just happy that my mornings are getting brighter nowadays
I'm just happy that my mornings are getting brighter nowadays
I'm just happy that my mornings are getting brighter nowadays
I'm just happy that my mornings are getting brighter nowadays, yeah

[Verse 1]
I turn off all the lights
I never thought that things could turn that way
What was I supposed to do?
Who could I trust? Needed a shoulder to cry on
You meant much more than that

[Verse 2]
You took me by surprise
The way you walked into my darkened life
You sent the storm away
Never expected you to be a friend to me
You meant much more than that

[Chorus]
I love you
Don't know what else to say to you
I know that we don't talk as much as we used to do
But this I'll say, I love you

[Verse 3]
You were the only one
Who saw me cry when I was all alone
The finest words you said
Carefully whispered to me in the dark
I'm here and I will always be

[Chorus]
I love you
Don't know what else to say to you
I know that we don't talk as much as we used to do
But this I'll say, I love you

[Bridge]
(I love you)
You meant much more than that
(I love you)
And you will always do
(I love you)
I didn't have a clue
(I love you)
That I was waiting on you

[Outro]
I love you
Don't know what else to say to you
I know that we don't talk as much as we used to do
But this I'll say, I love you
Yeah

Trust me when I tell you this ain't nothing against you

[Verse 2]
I hate to admit it, but I think I caught some feelings for you
Still fuckin' the same hoes, but none give me that feelin' from you
It's like I be with them, but I can't help but think 'bout you
I'd rather be with you, but I can't put myself through that
Huh, again
I trusted a bitch once, I cannot do that again
But what if you're the one? I'd mess it up, then lose out again
I don't want to see you leave, I'm refusing, I am, oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You asking me, "What is the issue?"
Callin' my Uber 'cause I don't wanna be with you
Trust me when I tell you this ain't nothing against you
I got some problems that I don't wanna get into

[Chorus]
I just fucked another bitch thinkin' about you
Can't even lie, all the time, I think about you
Lot of other bitches probably gon' think this about them
But girl, this is about you, girl, you know it
I just fucked another bitch thinkin' about you
Can't even lie, all the time, I think about you
Lot of other bitches probably gon' think this about them
But girl, this is about you, girl, you know it

[Verse 1]
From the ice age to the dole age
There is but one concern
I have just discovered:

[Chorus]
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers

[Verse 2]
As Anthony said to Cleopatra
As he opened a crate of ale:
Oh I say

[Chorus]
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' are bigger than others
Some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers

[Outro]
Send me the pillow
The one that you dream on
Send me the pillow
The one that you dream on
And I'll send you mine

On the shop floor
There’s a calendar
As obvious as snow
As if we didn’t know!

[Verse 1]
I left the North, I travelled South
I found a tiny house and I can't help the way I feel
Oh yes, you can kick me, and you can punch me
And you can break my face
But you won't change the way I feel
'Cause I love you

[Chorus]
And is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so, really so strange?
I say no, you say yes
And you will change your mind

[Verse 2]
I left the South, I travelled North
I got confused, I killed a horse, I can't help the way I feel
Oh yes, you can punch me and you can butt me
And you can break my spine
But you won't change the way I feel
'Cause I love you

[Chorus]
And is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so, really so strange?
I say no, you say yes
But you will change your mind

[Verse 3]
I left the North again, I travelled South again
And I got confused, I killed a nun, I can't help the way I feel
I can't help the way I feel
I can't help the way I feel
I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell

[Verse 4]
Why is the last mile the hardest mile?
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes
And I realised, I realised, I could never
I could never, never, never go back home again

[Chorus 1]
He was a sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
And he said that he'd never, never do it again
And of course he won't (oh, not until the next time)
He was a sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
And he swore that he'll never, never do it again
And of course he won't (oh, not until the next time)

[Verse 1]
Poor old man
He had an accident with a three-bar fire
But that's OK
Because he wasn't very happy anyway
Poor woman
Strangled in her very own bed as she read
But that's OK
Because she was old and she would have died anyway

[Chorus 2]
Don't blame the sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
Because he'll never, never, never, never, never, never do it again
Not until the next time

[Verse 2]
Jury, you've heard every word so before you decide
Would you look into those "Mother me" eyes?
I love you for you my love, you my love, you my love, you my love
Jury, you've heard every word but before you decide
Would you look into those "Mother me" eyes?
I love you for you my love, you my love
I love you just for you my love

[Chorus 3]
Don't blame the sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
Because he'll never, never do it again
And in the midst of life we are in death, etc
Sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
Because he'll never, never do it again
And in the midst of life we are in death, etc

[Outro]
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera
In the midst of life we are in debt, etc
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera
In the midst of life we are in debt, etc

Just will you free me?
Will you find me?
Will you free me?
Will you find me?
Will you free me, free me, free me, free me, free me, free me, free me?
Jury will you free me?
Will you find me?
Will you free me?
Will you find me?
How will you find me, find me, find me, find me, find me, find me, find me?

Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera... Etcetera!
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera
In the midst of life we are in debt, etc
Oh, oh

Hundred racks, strip club showers
Don't need a Perc' to fuck her for hours

[Verse 1]
A modern day marvel, but terrible—better—horrible
When he grab the mic from son, he crushed up all his metacarpals
He said he ain't mean it—totally by accident
After the show, he didn’t follow where y'all taxi went
Will this be available on wax? Ask Max Mill
They on the opposition to his ass-wack tax bill
But will it pass the senate? Slum lord tenant
And super like 1-A, have a fun stay
One day, he plan to put in a runway
With enough land for his own projects and gun play
Section 8 penthouse, maid look like Faye Dunaway
Alotta y'all ass out like gay runaways
It’s how they say "semi-risque"
All day everyday, give out Emmy's the quick way
Have the average MC say, "Gimme a sick day!"
They really ain't got shit to say like Timmy McVeigh
Get a hunch, a real rag tag bunch
In school, he kept a doo-rag in his bag lunch
Just to eat heads on some breakdance shit and spit
He writ this skit in Sanskrit
If the pants fit, sport 'em, but rock 'em low
Your man like Rollo on the slow, can't knock it though
It's like the same hustle, bro, two knuckles glow
Tucked-in Le Tigre—just let the name-buckle show

[Verse 2]
Good googly moogly—see that loogie?
Yeah—but keep it on the D.L. Hughley
You don't watch her, he might house her like Doogie
Just to cut her loosie like, *swoosh*—Mitsurugi
Gooey gum drops—who he got his style from?
—his pops—you gotta give the bum some props
Ask ya sister—her beat box is more-thicker
DOOM that nigga detox with more liquor

[Verse 3]
Villain for hire—admire the sound
Make sure the price is right before he come on down!
Rappers be on some "You, you, you!"
Forgot who they talking too, too much pork stew
They need to not come out with nothing new
Blew the whole shit up on some "What this button do?"
Doom cheat the game like walk-thru
Run ’em, son ’em like Mr. Rourke do Tattoo
The way alotta clowns get down is unnatural
This flow flip like oranges, apples
Rhymes like limes to a Lemonade Snapple
Leave her at the chapel, don't eat scrapple
First thing they notice when they come to is they bling is gone
Then they start remembering the Klingon with the rings on
In came the Villain with their own gear like, "Hi, there
Y’all play the rear, this whole year—my year."
Metal face beard like Brillo pad
Y'all know his steelo so don't feel so bad
Seed call him, "Ol' dad," the one the ol’ ho had
Knew he was a winner since a swimmer in the gonads
Okay pal, pay him like Paypal
So we could be A-OK not OK Corral
I think today I'll make the ladies say, "Ow"
And maybe fuck around take a bow, now

[Verse 4]
Who made his first mill and still carry razor blades
Used to be straight A's and still made the grade
'Tarded ass, how he get cash so fast?
Year after last, left back in the retarded class
Shoulda went to Boces
Watch him all closely, who he think he supposed to be
Villain who always win, at least he stay consistent
Find out where that bitch went, get a room, pitch a tent
Yo—yo, Max—yo, change the beat, yo
You got another one?

[Outro]
Nah, yo

[Verse 1: AJ]
Lemme tell you
What I see through my eyes
Apathy is all around and on the rise
We channel so much
Energy through our greed
Which leads us to
Become absolved of those in need
Lemme tell you

[Chorus: All & AJ]
Money can’t buy lives
Sunny days for you
Living is more than profits accrued
We need to love and be loved
And brought in the things we are thankful of
Remember your brothers (brother)
And sisters, because we are all in this together
Together, yeah

[Verse 2: Brian]
It's funny how we
Took a prayer out of schools
After the 9-11 scare, that's all we do
We compromise
Our liberties for security
We can become
So self in dosed that we can't see
Lemme tell you, yeah!

[Chorus: All & (Brian)]
Money can’t buy lives (money can't buy you)
Sunny days for you (sunny days)

Don’t throw in the towel
Let’s overcome the test for now
Together, yeah
Together we last, divided we fall (we fall)
Love will conquer all (conquer all)

[Chorus: All, (AJ), Nick & Brian]
Money can’t buy lives
Sunny days for you (sunny days)

If I couldn't see, yeah
If I couldn't see
Those eyes

Thank you
Lyrics from Snippets

[Young Thug]
...come out in the wash
It's gon' come out in the rinse, yeah
I don't want none of you thots, nah
I want a wife and more kids
I want the ones that talk that shit

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
Run, run like you do
I'm chasing you
I'm on your tail, I'm gaining fast, you're going nowhere
Try to fix what you've done
And turn back the sun
The night is calling, and we're falling faster now

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Pushin' me away
Every last word, every single thing you say
Pushin' me away
Try to stop me now, but it's already too late
Pushin' me away
If you really don't care, then say it to my face
Pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Stop, tell me the truth
'Cause I'm so confused
Spinning around, these walls are falling down, and I need you
More than you know
I'm not letting go
I'm getting close, so take my hand and please just tell me why

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Pushin' me away
Every last word, every single thing you say
Pushin' me away
Try to stop me now, but it's already too late
Pushin' me away
If you really don't care, then say it to my face
Pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away

[Bridge: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
Push, push, pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away
Push, push, pushin' me away
Push, push, pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Pushin' me away
Every last word, every single thing you say
Pushin' me away
Try to stop me now, but it's already too late
Pushin' me away
If you really don't care, then say it to my face
Pushin' me away
You're push, push, pushin' me away

[Outro: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Pushin' me away

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Well, yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes"

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & (Jonas Brothers)]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift & Joe Jonas]
You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Joe Jonas]
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes"

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & (Jonas Brothers)]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me
Oh, whoa

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Jonas Brothers, Joe Jonas]
I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No no, no, no

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & (Jonas Brothers)]
You should've said, "No"
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Outro]
Ladies and gentleman, Taylor Swift!
Thank you very much

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Told you I made dinner plans
For you and me and no one else
That don't include your crazy friends
Well, I'm done (I'm done)
With awkward situations, empty conversations
One, two

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get
Alright, keep those hands going, come on

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
So, this is where the story ends
A conversation on I.M
Well, I'm done (I'm done)
With texting sorry for the miscommunication

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Next time I see you
I'm giving you a high five (High five)
'Cause hugs are overrated, just FYI

[Breakdown: Joe Jonas]
Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two, yeah
One, two, three, four

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick JOnas]
Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
Call I'll never get
Call I'll never get
Thank you

You go around like you know
Who I am, but you don't
You've got me on my toes

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]

Can't hold myself back

Walk in the room, all I can see is you, oh

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby

Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you, baby

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
So, here we are again
Throwing punch lines, no one wins
As the morning sun begins to rise, we're fading fast
And we won't work this out

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & (Joe Jonas)]
No, we're not gonna work this out tonight
(We won't work this out)
No, we're not gonna make this right
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye
(Give a kiss goodbye)
'Cause we're not gonna work this out tonight

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Every single word's been said (Whoa)
Broke each other's hearts again (Whoa)
As the starlit sky begins to shine, we're breaking down
She screams out

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & (Joe Jonas)]
No, we're not gonna work this out tonight
(We won't work this out)
No, we're not gonna make this right
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye

[Outro: Nick Jonas & (Joe Jonas)]
Well, there's no need to fight, we're just wasting time

If you give it a try, well, then maybe you'll find
(We might work this out)
Well, we know we're in love, so let us keep it alive
(Keep it alive, keep it alive)
(Tonight)
I'm starting to see the morning light
We finally worked this out

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Hey! hey! hey!
I was sittin' at home watching TV all alone
I'm so tired of reruns, I've memorized this show
So I pick up the phone, call everyone I know
Said there's gonna be a party, hit the music, here we go
Yeah

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
You gotta live to party, bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
Are you ready to rock and roll?
Hey! hey! hey!

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
We were out on the floor, yeah, we danced the night away
Then she looked at her watch and said that it was late
Then she pulled me aside and said she couldn't stay
(I really gotta go)
But I begged her for one more song, let the music play
Yeah

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
You gotta live to party, bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
Are you ready to rock and roll?
Hey! hey! hey!

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
I drove her home, and then she whispered in my ear
The party doesn't have to end
We can dance here

[Breakdown: Joe Jonas]
Live to party, bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
Are you ready to rock and roll?

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
You gotta live to party, bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
(Are you ready to rock and roll?)
You gotta live to party, bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
Are you ready to rock and roll?
You gotta live to party, bust your move
Everybody's in the groove
Tell the DJ to play our song
(Are you ready to rock and roll?)

[Outro: All]
Live...to...party!

[Chorus]
Well, some years went by, time move fast
Tryin' to remember where you find me at
When I was young, when I was young
It's such a beautiful world, I wanna see the whole thing
Goin' places, not a single person knows me
Glad I'm still young, I'm glad I'm still young

[Verse 1]
Uh, look, yeah
As I drive around the city that I live in
Lookin' all around me, I remember bein' children
Just havin' fun, we was some wild ones
With a three-mile-long smile on
As a kid causin' mischief, just monkey business
Stayin' up past midnight was such a privilege
I didn't have to worry 'bout shit
Fall and cut your knee, get the first aid kit
Had a crush on a girl, you wanna hold hands
Heard a slow jam, ask your girl to slow dance
Mom read me stories, thought I was Peter Pan
Pops did his thing, he taught me to be a man
Life went by fast, now I'm 'bout to be eighteen
Lookin' in the mirror, seein' what the world made me
And I'm satisfied, I think I'm doin' fine
Lookin' at the jungle gym I used to climb, I think

[Chorus]
Well, some years went by, time move fast
Tryin' to remember where you find me at
When I was young, when I was young
It's such a beautiful world, I wanna see the whole thing
Goin' places, not a single person knows me
Glad I'm still young, I'm glad I'm still young

[Verse 2]
Uh
Then high school started, I'm rememberin' that
Walkin' round the halls, no clue where I was at
With my backpack, pants sagged, half mask
Crackin' jokes just tryin' to make the class laugh
I was and still am the kid that'll keep you smilin'
Little ladies man, girls never was a challenge
Never on the honor roll, too much chronic smoke
Am I in college? No, but to be honest though
I wouldn't have it any other way
I do it all the same if it was any other day
You gon' know when the time is good
'Cause ain't nothin' comin' close to your childhood

[Chorus]
Well, some years went by, time move fast
Tryin' to remember where you find me at
When I was young, when I was young
It's such a beautiful world, I wanna see the whole thing
Goin' places, not a single person knows me
Glad I'm still young, I'm glad I'm still young

[Intro: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
If the heart is always searching
Can you ever find a home?
I've been looking for that someone
I'll never make it on my own
Dreams can't take the place of loving you
There's gotta be a million reasons why it's true

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
How long will I be waiting
To be with you again?
I'm gonna tell you that I love you
In the best way that I can
I can't take a day without you here
You're the light that makes my darkness disappear

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

[Bridge: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
More and more, I start to realize
I can reach my tomorrow
I can hold my head up high
And it's all because you're by my side

[Breakdown: Nick Jonas]
When you look me in the eyes
You tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When I hold you in my arms
I know that it's forever
I just gotta let you know
I never wanna let you go

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
Oh, I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
Oh, yeah
Oh, whoa, whoa, yeah

[Intro: Jak Knight]
This is, this is that shit that you, like...
How do I even say this right?
This, this is like some shit you go and pick your, your homie up from jail wit' (Limbo)

[Chorus]
Look
Uh-uh, oh (Yeah, I like that)
Yeah, uh-uh, oh (Yup)
Bury me before I'm a burden
Don't bury me 'til niggas is certain
I'm singin', singin'
Uh-uh, oh
Yeah, uh-uh, oh
Bury me before I'm a burden
Don't bury me 'til niggas is certain

[Verse 1]
When your skin darker, shit gets harder (True)
This a black album like Shawn Carter (Yee)
Screamin' like I'm Rico, moshin' like I'm Steve-O
Niggas dodging bullets at Wi', jammin' off of Pico
At the barber shop, I got the bald fade
That was before the chubby niggas had the Balmain
You know Giuseppe-ass niggas with the Louis shades
Type to call a girl a bitch if she don't give 'em play (Yeah)
At sixteen, I was survivin' off of noodle cups (Damn)
Shit is legal, now the dealers know the jig is up
When it's us, niggas gettin' years, maybe ten and up
Soccer moms do the same, but government don't give a fuck (True)
You know I'm hailin' from that Rip City, get busy
If I die, roll out the yellow carpet if you fuck with me
Yellow roses in the sky
Pastor rock a yellow tie
Choir make my mama cry
Yellow suit, yeah, I'm fly
Coldplay playin' "Yellow" live

[Chorus]
Ooh, uh-uh, oh (Goddamn)
Yeah, uh-uh, oh (You got to make it better or things won't change)
Bury me before I'm a burden (They stay the same)
Don't bury me 'til niggas is certain (This shit is so hard)
I'm singin', singin' (Yeah)
Ooh, uh-uh, oh
Yeah, uh-uh, oh, yup (You got to make it better or things won't change)
Bury me before I'm a burden (They stay the same)
Don't bury me 'til niggas is certain (Okay)

[Verse 2]
Man, I'd rather die before I give up
Keep my fuckin' foot on they necks and never let up
Mark my words, my nigga Marc used to say that (Yeah)
That was way before my nigga Yos had the wave cap (Yeah)
And to top it off, my best friend had a baby (Woo)
We twenty-five, I told that nigga, "Boy, you fuckin' crazy"
Maybe I'm the one who really need the Lord to save me
The last time I went to church was in the fuckin' '80s
Can you believe that?
I was born in '94 (Woo), can you believe that?
Your favorite rapper's doin' blow, can you believe that?
Wide awake, but comatose, Hollywoods and overdose
Girls say innuendos, I'm in limbo, but I know the ropes
And it's really hard to cope with a Pilot Jones
When the love is lost like I'm Coppola
Translatin' losses before Twitter go and soak it up
Beat so cold, it made Aminé wanna open up

[Chorus]
Ooh, uh-uh, oh (Woo)
Yeah, uh-uh, oh (You got to make it better or things won’t change)
Bury me before I'm a burden (They stay the same)
Don't bury me 'til niggas is certain
I'm singin', singin'
Ooh, uh-uh, oh (Yeah)
Yeah, uh-uh, oh (You got to make it better or things won’t change)
Bury me before I'm a burden (No, things won't change, they stay the same)
Don't bury me 'til niggas is certain (They stay the same, oh)

[Outro]
Blessings (Blessings), blessings (Blessings)
Blessings (Blessings), blessings (Blessings)
Time's of the essence, I'm tryna get on essence
Man, I don't take suggestions, God gave me them
Blessings (Blessings), blessings (Blessings)
Blessings (Blessings), blessings (Blessings)
Time's of the essence
God gave me them

[Intro]
Yung Lan on the track
James about that check, boy (Aminé)

[Chorus]
Came a long way from that Woodlawn Park (Yee)
Now, young Aminé pushin' push to start (True)
Mr. Yellowman got himself a lil' jam
Made my fetty in Japan 'cause I do this shit for Marc (Woo)
Playin' him my shit through the phone
He tell me keep my foot up on they necks for the throne
You ain't really on 'til all your niggas on
I tell him keep his head up and he set up when he home (True)

[Verse 1]
Look, RIP Kobe (Woo)
Nigga, RIP Kobe (Yeah)
You was like a dad to a nigga, so I'm sad, my nigga
Had to get you tatted on me (True)
I keep the niggas that I trust by my side (True)
'Cause everybody want a piece of the pie (Yee)
There's a Buffie the Body in every city
And sloppy toppy the hobby, so baby, get in the ride (True)
Bitch, you bad as fuck (Yeah), swipe the Visa (True, wait, wait)
Just watch what you spend 'cause my mama need rent
And my neck gotta look like a freezer (Pew, pew)
I keep some Prada on my ass (Yeah)
I put Chanel on the bag (You're welcome)
Shawty wanna sit on my face like a new chair
I ain't gon' show up 'til you pay up and it's all there (Uh-huh)

[Chorus]
Came a long way from that Woodlawn Park
Now, young Aminé pushin' push to start
Mr. Yellowman got himself a lil' jam
Made my fetty in Japan 'cause I do this shit for Marc
Playin' him my shit through the phone
He tell me keep my foot up on they necks for the throne
You ain't really on 'til all your niggas on
I tell him keep his head up and he set up when he home (Ah)

[Verse 2]
Back out (Woo, ah), I'm finna blow her back out (Ah, ayy)
I'm sippin' on a Moscow (Ah), yellow suit like The Mask now
"Sexy" my nickname (Yeah), you'll bump this for six days (Straight)
This shit is so hard that'll make a hatin' nigga do the muhfuckin' thizz face (Yeah, yeah)
Fly-ass nigga handsome (Yee), tantrum (Yee)
G got a Lil Tecca, it's a ransom (Yee)
Don't play dumb, muhfucka, this the anthem (Yeah)
I'm the lead, lil' nigga, you the stand-in
Okay, big money, big cash
Portland in this muhfucka, nigga, dig that (True)
I'm in this bitch, singin' nothings to a bitch who mean nothin'
But I got a big heart with them big racks (Pew, pew)

[Chorus]
Came a long way from that Woodlawn Park (Yee)
Now, young Aminé pushin' push to start
Mr. Yellowman got himself a lil' jam
Made my fetty in Japan 'cause I do this shit for Marc
Playin' him my shit through the phone
He tell me keep my foot up on they necks for the throne
You ain't really on 'til all your niggas on
I tell him keep his head up and he set up when he home (Yeah)

[Outro]
Came a long way, came a long way, I done
Came a long way, came a long way, came a long way, I done
Came a long way (Yeah, yeah), came a long way (Yeah), ah
Came a long way, I done came a long way, yeah

[Interlude: Jak Knight]
It weirdly, like, fast-forwarded my maturity
It weirdly was like one of those things where, like
He died and I feel like my, like, a lot of my innocence
In, like, being a young person died with Kobe
And now, like, with him being gone, I'm like
Let me figure out how money works
Let me figure how, like, how to buy a house
And how to move and, like
Like, I don't know, like, when, like, it was such like a—
Like, I felt like a piece of my childhood go with that nigga
And, like, I'm completely like I'm twenty-six
Woah

[Verse 1: Aminé]
You say you heard a lot about me
Nigga, fuck what you heard
It's all fun and games 'til it happens like a Based God curse
Yeah, cell keep tickin' on me like I'm six-one-seven
My cousin steez Stizz like he's six-one-seven, okay
Devil on my shoulder, marijuana from Boulder
You know my niggas in this muthafuckin' bitch
If bein' ugly was pretty, I'd be the shit
Never been nowhere, but these niggas, they love to trip
Eritrea, Ethiopia, Habesha utopia
Bitches gettin' cold, then niggas grab your Patagonias
So I Toby acquired her
I had to get a baby who could make me get wired up
You know I'm 'bout that action
My nigga Marc could get it crackin'
Open up your soul and take your body like, "What's ha'nnin'"
I'm not a succulent or sucker, baby girl
These roots made me, I bring my flowers to the world (Yeah)

[Chorus: Aminé, Aminé & Charlie Wilson, Charlie Wilson]
It's on me
Wear my flaws like ice, keep my soul in sight (No, no, oh)
The sun is on me
And my stems don't bite if the light shines bright (No, no, no, no, no, no, no)
It's rainin' on me
My guilt weigh heavy, it cost me a life
I got my own seeds (Yeah)
They rip my petals to my six 'cause my roots won't die

[Interlude: Aminé & Charlie Wilson]
Check this out
Like humans and animals
Plants need both water and nutrients to survive, food
Most all plants use water to carry moisture, nutrients
Back and forth between the roots and leaves
Bitch

[Verse 2: JID]
Searchin' for my shelter through the storm
I find peace, my safe haven, keepin' me far away from harm
Nevertheless, the greener grass is proof the roots are strong
But now we standin' here, divided, choose the side where you belong
Mama, keep the lights on
Yeah, all I see is red, so we awake the dead
She likes my third eye, she loves my third leg
This my third time around the worldwide, winds
Give me the Versai-, Versac-, Benz, put work in
Made my words work with pens, scribblin' sins, I drop gems
I don't got tick-tock time for them, seeds or stems
Evil men plottin', we see you 'cause we watching
We see you, believe me you, we see you (Mr. Route)
Get your ass up out that grass and stretch your limbs
Photosynthesis, I see the future picture, take a glimpse
Everything you tryna have is in your grab, so get a grip (Mr. Route)
It's for the kids (Mr. Route)
Yo, what it is?

[Chorus: Aminé, Aminé & Charlie Wilson, Charlie Wilson]
It's on me
Wear my flaws like ice, keep my soul in sight (No, no, oh)
The sun is on me
And my stems don't bite if the light shines bright (No, no, no, no, no, no, no)
It's rainin' on me
My guilt weigh heavy, it cost me a life
I got my own seeds (Yeah)
They rip my petals to my six 'cause my roots won't die
(What the fuck)

[Outro: Ritchie With a T & Charlie Wilson]
Holy holy holy, holy holy holy (Let me grow)

[Intro]
You good, T-Minus?

[Chorus]
I can't decide if it's you or I, baby
When we, we high, all I know is you saved me
Love ain't what I thought I would have found, baby
Lost track of time, but I've made up my mind, baby

[Verse 1]
Tell me what the fuck I'm supposed to do
You say you love me, but you don't give a clue
I could give a fuck about your past and your nigga, in fact
I put your ex in the garbage and put a bitch on the map
I'm singin', I got imperfections I don't like
You chase rumors, hatin' the advice
I could give a fuck about them lies
Cross me once, I'm cuttin' like all ties

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes one (One), two (Two)
Three, four minutes in the pool (Oh yeah)
Then it go five (Five), six (Six)
A couple strokes with them butterfly hips (Oh yeah)
Then it go seven (Seven), eight (Eight)
Fuck a towel 'cause a nigga can't wait
I'm goin' nine (Nine, yeah), ten (Ten)
We both know we was never just friends

[Chorus]
I can't decide if it's you or I, baby
When we, we high, all I know is you saved me
Love ain't what I thought I would have found, baby
Lost track of time, but I've made up my mind, baby

[Verse 2]
Listen, lil' mommy, you trippin wallahi
We fuss and we fight, then we fuck the next mornin'
Get head in Ferrari, we petty and horny
I tell her I want it, I want it, I want it
I'm gone, off the meds
I'm the one you call, Aminé with the dreads
She want a big dick nigga with the bread
Oh, pussy fire, had a young nigga dead (Dead)

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes one (One), two (Two)
Three, four minutes in the pool (Oh yeah)
Then it go five (Five), six (Six)
A couple strokes with them butterfly hips (Oh yeah)
Then it go seven (Seven), eight (Eight)

We both know we was never just friends

[Chorus]
I can't decide if it's you or I, baby
When we, we high, all I know is you saved me
Love ain't what I thought I would have found, baby
Lost track of time, but I've made up my mind, baby

[Chorus: Aminé]
Pressure in my palms (Yeah, I got that)
Pressure in my palms (Boy, I got that)

[Chorus: Aminé]
Pressure in my palms (Yeah, I got that)

[Verse 2: slowthai & Vince Staples]
Why they keep eyein' me? Why they keep eyein' me?
Plank is mahogany, your head leakin' burgundy (Ah)
Menace to society, you're more Ron Weasley (Brrt)
Into gynecology, you're pussy and that's peachy (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
I hate a bitch who think a baby finna keep a nigga (I hate you ho)
Why every time he see his kids, we gotta see the picture? (I hate you too man)
I do it bigger, know I'm ballin', don't you see the ticker? (Yeah)
Feel like I'm Harden, I was shootin' on Artesia with him (Yeah)
Baby said she need commitment (Uh-huh), I guess I'll think about it (Yo)
I never leave without it (Yo), he down to squeeze, I doubt it
I keep her bad and bougie, booty on a hundred thousand (Uh-huh)
Big headed, barely fit her weave around it (Ayy), Norf

[Chorus: Aminé]
Pressure in my palms (Woah)
Pressure in my palms (Boy, I got that)
Pressure sweatin' in my, pressure sweatin' in my (Yeah)
Pressure sweatin' in my palms (Yeah, goddamn it)

[Bridge: Aminé & Bree Runway]
Don't let anger control you
Don't let anger control you
Pressure in my palms (Yee)

[Verse 4: Aminé]
I blow the smoke in your face
You niggas think you runnin' shit, but runnin' in place
I'm takin' the base, yeah, I'm takin' it home
I'm a young Jackie, nigga, if I hit it, it's gone
You Bisquick scallywag silly muthafuckas
I do yo ass the same way that Ye did Taylor
Or how they did Janet, you wouldn't understand it
Hola, hola, hola, yeah, a nigga failed Spanish
Passive aggressive niggas who passive, I can't save ya
Anticipatin' patience is somethin' I cannot favor
Goodbye to you bitch niggas, I'll probably see you never
How could you hate on us? Come on, homie, we major
We major?
Come on, homie, we major
The ice so cold and, nigga, I don’t do favors
I did it on my own and I'll do it again
Bitch, I gets mine, fuck a nigga's cosign, singin'

[Chorus: Bree Runway]
Pressure in my palms (Pressure in my palms)
Pressure in my palms, boy I got
Pressure in my palms (The feelin' so unknown, baby)
Pressure in my palms
Pressure in my palms (Pressure in my palms)
Pressure in my palms, boy I got
Pressure in my palms (And I don't know)
Pressure in my palms (If I got it goin' on)

[Outro: Jak Knight]
There ain't no money in havin' hate in your heart
There ain't no money in that shit, bro
That's, that's broke nigga shit to have hate in your heart
I know very untalented people with a lot of love in their heart who are doing great

[Verse 1: Aminé & Summer Walker]
I know this ship is sailed and this is dead
I'm singin', "RIP," I'm singin', "RIP," yeah
I know you gave up long time ago
Boy, I'm singin', "RIP," I'm singin', "RIP"
But all I need's some

[Pre-Chorus: Both, Aminé & Summer Walker]
Lovin', some fuckin'
And you say this shit don't matter
But we always goin' at it, ain't no trustin'
I need some lovin', good, good fuckin'
And we fussin' and we fight, and you always wonder why
And my mama told me, "None of this should come as a surprise"

[Chorus: Aminé & Summer Walker, Aminé]
'Cause love don't come easy, it don't come easy
Love don't come easy, yeah, givin' up easy
Love don't come easy, it don't come easy
It don't come easy
Times get hard, but nothing's easy

[Verse 2: Summer Walker, Aminé & Both]
Let's go out
Let's try it out, uh
You don't hear me out, yeah
That's why you always run your mouth, uh
We been talking 'bout our love's runnin' out
But you don't hear me out, yeah
That's why you always run your mouth
And all I need's some

[Pre-Chorus: Both, Aminé & Summer Walker]
Lovin', some fuckin'
And the sex is still compatible
But I ain't got no manual for trustin'
I need some lovin', good, good fuckin'
You say something isn't right, only fuckin', gettin' high
And my daddy told me, "Hold your heart in order to survive"

[Chorus: Aminé & Summer Walker, Summer Walker]
'Cause love don't come easy, it don't come easy
Love don't come easy, yeah, givin' up easy
Love don't come easy, it don't come easy (No, no)
It don't come easy
Times get hard, but nothing's easy

[Outro: Summer Walker & Aminé]
Tell your man you trust him
Tell your girl you love her
Tell your dad you miss him
And call your mom and thank her
Tell your daughter you love her
And tell your son you're proud of him
Tell yourself you got this
'Cause these times get hard, but nothing's easy

[Chorus: Amine with Charlie Wilson]
Mama, uh huh
Mama
Yeah, yeah, I'm singin', mama
Ah yeah, yeah, that's my mama
Uh, I said, mama
I do this shit for my mama
Can't lie to my mama
I gotta cry for my ma-ma-ma-mama

[Verse 1]
Look where I'm at, Mommy, who woulda knew?
Sometimes, I miss the days where you'd take me to school
Used to promise when I'm rich that I would get your favorite whip
You was my lift before the Lyft, so you deserve you a coupe
Twenty-plus years at the Post Office (Yeah)
You was workin' graveyard shifts for the both of us (Yeah)
You deserve a long vacation, a standing ovation
And shout out Ms. Bekele for the genius notations

[Pre-Chorus: Aminé]
And it's you that I'm missin'
Every time I needed someone, you would listen
I'ma write you a song to put on everyday
So the times that I'm gone, you could smile when it plays
I'ma take you to the GRAMMYs in a yellow suit
Put ya in Chanel just to show 'em how my mama do
My number one fan, I'm your number one man
When I thought that I couldn't you told me that I can

[Chorus: Amine with Charlie Wilson]
Mama, uh huh
Mama
Yeah, yeah, I'm singin', mama
Ah yeah, yeah, that's my mama
Uh, I said, mama
I do this shit for my mama
Can't lie to my mama
I gotta cry for my ma-ma-ma-mama

[Post-Chorus: ODIE]
'Cause you're the only woman in my life
Who makes me smile, you make me smile
'Cause you're the only woman in my life
Who makes me smile, you make me smile

[Verse 2: Aminé]
First year I moved out, I was strugglin' (True)
Didn't wanna tell 'cause I know that you be worryin' (Yeah)
You told me, "Go back to college," but I went back to Cali (Woo)
Had to celebrate a couple birthdays without me (Yeah)
Whooped my ass, so I had to learn the harder way (Yeah, yeah)
Bad lil' nigga, of course I was a balegē (Yeah)
Would never tell you one lie, okay, maybe one lie (Woo)
You my favorite person, let's go 'head and make the song cry

[Pre-Chorus: Aminé]
And it's you that I'm missin'
Every time I needed someone, you would listen
I'ma write you a song to put on everyday
So the times that I'm gone, you could smile when it plays
You my idol and the one that I need (Yeah)
Best cook, best looks, you support all my dreams
Look, I'm thankful to be your son, it's my honor
Tonight I want to quote 2Pac, "Dear Mama"

[Chorus: Amine with Charlie Wilson]
Mama, uh huh
Mama
Yeah, yeah, I'm singin', mama
Ah yeah, yeah, that's my mama
Uh, I said, mama
I do this shit for my mama
Can't lie to my mama
I gotta cry for my ma-ma-ma-mama

[Break: Charlie Wilson & Aminé]
Mama
Mama
Mama
Mama
Mama (I do this shit for my)
Mama (Can’t lie to my)
Mama (I gotta cry for my)
Ma-ma-ma-mama

[Outro: ODIE]
'Cause you're the only woman in my life
Who makes me smile, you make me smile
'Cause you're the only woman in my life
Who makes me smile, you make me

[Intro: Aminé]
Yeah
Woo
Yeah-yeah
Uh-uh, uh-uh

[Verse 1: Aminé]
Working dead-end jobs 'til my girl off
Me and my baby broke so we don't know what condoms are
The chains my mama gave me clinkin' like they Dorothy, dog
I hope my seed don't inherit my dad's cholesterol
I'm protective 'cause this world has got a evil will
They givin' guns with every muthafuckin' Happy Meal
A shooter every month and they pretend it's daffodils
My son'll probably see that fire before a fire drill
We fell in love and lit a flame before the tinder came
Back when T.I., "Bring Em Out" and 50 fuck with Game
We was a unit, somethin' special, life was super bliss
You shook your iced coffees like they was Shakira's hips
Ya dig

[Chorus: Aminé]
I-I-I want it, but she-she-she callin'
She want to get on it, I tell her I'm on one
Said, "We could have a baby, baby girl"
But what kinda nigga am I if I bring 'em in this world?
I-I-I want it, but she-she-she callin'
She want to get on it, I tell her I'm on one
Said, "We could have a baby, baby girl"
But what kinda nigga am I if I bring 'em in this world?

[Break: Aminé]
To my future daughter or son
The streams from this album gon' pay for your college funds (Limbo)
The circle of life could make a man feel like the one
Just know that you on purpose, it's never just hit and run, look

[Verse 2: Stepa J. Groggs & Ritchie with a T]
She said she might've missed her period
But my mind is somewhere else and I'm in sixth period
You know, seventeen and delirious
Thinkin' we independent on that scared of our parents shit
See plan B really gotta be Plan B
Shit, maybe C, D, E, this is my damn seed, yeah
We paid cash, rip up the damn receipt
'Cause mama got my account, that shit she can't see
Either time's flyin' or my mind is playin' tricks
Can't believe my baby girl's already turnin' six
Pray you nothin' like your daddy, stay away from drugs
Hope I can be half the father that my mama was
Yeah, hope I can be half the father that the Mamba was
But now I'm kinda stuck 'cause what I'm chasin's so possessful
'Cause Adam, yeah, Adam talkin' college funds
Shit, and I don't know if I'll have enough
'Cause, man, this game is inconsistent
Yeah, ain't nothin' promised
And a bi-weekly paycheck sound perfect for my wallet
At what point you hang the gloves up and put your tie on?
Yeah, have I been wrong? Yeah

[Chorus: Aminé]
I-I-I want it, but she-she-she callin'
She want to get on it, I tell her I'm on one
Said, "We could have a baby, baby girl"
But what kinda nigga am I if I bring 'em in this world?
I-I-I want it, but she-she-she callin'
She want to get on it, I tell her I'm on one
Said, "We could have a baby, baby girl"
But what kinda nigga am I if I bring 'em in this world?

[Outro: Jak Knight]
I think we are just so used to life not being valued
That we think wasting it on kindness is a bad idea
You should be gettin' money
You should be fuckin' hoes
You should drive fast cars
And then you realize that you, sometimes, you get those things
And now you're just a nigga with those things
'Cause it's like, well, what's next?
And it's like, well, I never tried a grapefruit by itself
And now you're just a nigga peelin', like, eatin' a grapefruit
And you're like, "This is nice"
With sugar in it and you're like, "Why is this nicer than my Ferrari?"

[Intro: Joyce Wrice]
My reality is my fantasy
I know I'm so gone, I know I'm so gone
Is my fantasy
When there's nothing wrong
My problems are gone

[Verse 1: Aminé]
Ahem, can I feel myself?
Used to need a handout, now I need no help
Niggas that I used to look up to is gettin' shook up too
And nigga, you don't know how weird that felt
Look, I went from skippin' class to making a classic
I'm steppin' over niggas and I'm skippin' the practice
AI, when it come to the checks, I'm like, "Taxes? Taxes? Taxes?"
I always did what the fuck I wanted
And now, girls scream like my shows all haunted
Livin' out the words that I used to say
We all dream, but to live this way

[Chorus: Joyce Wrice & Aminé]
Is my fantasy (And my fantasies lookin' like it's reality)
When there's nothing wrong (God gave me the audacity)
My problems are gone (That's why these niggas probably mad at me)
Is my fantasy (And my fantasies lookin' like it's reality)
When there's nothin' wrong (God gave me the audacity)
My problems are gone (Now I smile 'cause it's reality)

[Verse 2: Aminé]
Fantasies, boy, I just can't believe
And we all got dreams, hopin' for reality
You know I can't make it (Hey), you know I can't lie to ya
You know I can't fake it, you know I can't lie to ya
Yeah, so as I skrrt in my brand new Range
The grapefruit fills a void I can't explain
They be like, "Woah, what's that, my nigga?"
I be like, "That's a banana link chain"
As I sit here and stare at my things
The glass half-full from the joy that they bring
Livin' out the words that I used to say
We all dream, but to live this way

[Chorus: Joyce Wrice & Aminé]
Is my fantasy (And my fantasies lookin' like it's reality)
When there's nothing wrong (God gave me the audacity)
My problems are gone (That's why these niggas probably mad at me)
Is my fantasy (And my fantasies lookin' like it's reality)
When there's nothin' wrong (God gave me the audacity)
My problems are gone (Now I smile 'cause it's reality)

[Outro: Daniel Caesar]
Who would've thought we'd live where the Sun sets?
Livin' a dream that still isn't done yet
I'm livin' out my fantasies
Don't know if the glow could handle me
I'm with my dawgs, we stay gettin' money
I gotta say, this shit isn't funny
We livin' out our fantasies
Don't know if the glow could handle we
Who would've thought we'd live where the Sun sets?
Livin' a dream that still isn't done yet
I'm livin' out my fantasies
Don't know if the glow could handle me
I'm with my dawgs, we stay gettin' money
I gotta say, this shit isn't funny
We livin' out our fantasies
Don't know if the glow could handle we

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
She's such a flirt
And I am the lonely heart
Give it a chance
For our love to start
But you'll never see
If you don't give me a shot
To show you what I've got

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
But it's too late to pretend
You know me better than I know myself
Don't take my heart and put it on a shelf
Always someone else
The next guy who will make your cold heart melt
I'm gonna give my love to someone else

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
I held your hand (Ah, ah)
It felt like a movie
I made some plans (Ah, ah)
But you were already moving on now
I'm stuck under a rainy cloud
But you don't seem to care
But it's alright 'cause it's

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Too late to pretend
You know me better than I know myself
Don't take my heart and put it on a shelf, yeah
Always someone else
The next guy who will make your cold heart melt
I'm gonna give my love to someone else

[Bridge: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I'm tired of wastin' all my time
My heart is hangin' on the line
Is it me, girl, or someone else?
Please take me off the shelf

[Breakdown: Nick Jonas]
Too late to pretend
You know me better than I know myself
Don't take my heart and put it on a shelf

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
Everybody
Always someone else
The next guy who will make your cold heart melt
I'm gonna give my love to someone else, yeah
Woo, ooh

[Intro: Joe Jonas]
I'm so used to saying, "Do you wanna hear a new song? Now I can finally say that you guys ahve probably heard this song today
If you don't know the words to the song please sing along"

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Called you for the first time yesterday
Finally found the missing part of me
I felt so close, but you were far away
Left me without anything to say

[Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
Now I'm speechless
Over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Now I'm hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again
Guys, can you help me out?

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas, (Joe Jonas)]
I can't get your smile out of my mind
(I can't get you out of my mind)
I think about your eyes all the time
You're beautiful, but you don't even try
(You don't even, don't even try)
Modesty is just so hard to find

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Now I'm speechless
Over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Now I'm hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
I kissed her for the first time yesterday
Everything I wished that it would be
Suddenly I forgot how to speak
Hopeless, breathless
Baby, can't you see?

[Chorus Variation: Joe Jonas]
Now I'm... 

[guitar solo]
Now I'm speechless
Over the edge, I'm just breathless
I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again
Now I'm hopeless, head over heels in the moment
I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again

[Outro: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
Oh, lovebug again
Woo! Thank you very much

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Got the news today
Doctor said I had to stay a little bit longer and I'll be fine
When I thought it'd all been done
When I thought it'd all been said
A little bit longer and I'll be fine

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
But you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low
And every time you smile, you laugh, you glow
You don't even know, no, no
You don't even know

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
All this time goes by, still no reason why
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
Waiting on a cure, but none of them are sure
A little bit longer and I'll be fine

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
But you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low
And every time you smile, you laugh, you glow
You don't even know, no, no

[Breakdown: Nick Jonas]
You don't even know, no, no
You don't even know, no, no

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low, yeah
And every time you smile, you laugh, you glow
You don't even know, yeah

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
So I'll wait 'til kingdom come
All the highs and lows are gone
A little bit longer and I'll be fine
I'll be...

[Spoken: Nick Jonas]
About two and a half years ago, I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Shook my whole world upside down. But I made a commitment to myself. I was going to the hospital at night. But I wouldn't let it slow me down. I'm here to tell you, it hasn't slowed me down. Now here's what I want you to do. I want you to sing this as loud as you can. Can you do that? Joe, can you show them what to do with their hands, please? Here we go

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone (Sing it out)
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low, yeah
And every time you smile, you laugh, you glow
You don't even know, no, no (Come on)
But you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you don't know what it's like to feel so low (Just you)
And every time you smile, you laugh, you glow
You don't even know
Thank you

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas & (Joe Jonas)]
Told you I made dinner plans
For you and me and no one else
That don't include your crazy friends
Well, I'm done (I'm done)
With awkward situations, empty conversations
(One, two)

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas & (Joe Jonas)]
So, this is where the story ends
A conversation on I.M
Well, I'm done (I'm done)
With texting sorry for the miscommunication
(One, two, three)

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Next time I see you
I'm giving you a high five
'Cause hugs are overrated, just FYI

[Breakdown: Joe Jonas]
Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two, yeah
(One, two, three)

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Ooh, this is an S.O.S
Don't wanna second guess
This is the bottom line, it's true
I gave my all for you
Now my heart's in two
And I can't find the other half
It's like I'm walking on broken glass
Better believe I bled
It's a call I'll never get

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
Call I'll never get
Call I'll never get
Thank you!

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
Well, here we are again
Throwing punch lines, no one wins
As the morning sun begins to rise, we're fading fast
And we won't work this out

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & (Joe Jonas)]
No, we're not gonna work this out tonight
(We won't work this out)
No, we're not gonna make this right
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye
(Give a kiss goodbye)
'Cause we're not gonna work this out tonight

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Every single word's been said (Whoa)
Broke each other's hearts again (Whoa)
As the starlit sky begins to shine, we're breaking down
She screams out

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & (Joe Jonas)]
No, we're not gonna work this out tonight
(We won't work this out)
No, we're not gonna make this right
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye
(Give a kiss goodbye)
'Cause we're not gonna work this out tonight

[Interlude: Joe Jonas]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
We don't have to fight tonight
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
We just gotta try tonight
(We got to work this out)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
We don't have to fight tonight
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)
We just gotta try tonight

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & (Joe Jonas)]
No, we're not gonna work this out tonight
(We won't work this out)
No, we're not gonna make this right
So I'll give a kiss and say goodbye
(Give a kiss goodbye)
'Cause we're not gonna work this out tonight

[Outro: Nick Jonas & (Joe Jonas)]
Well, there's no need to fight, we're just wasting time
(Tonight)
If you give it a try well then maybe you'll find
(We might work this out)
Well, we know we're in love, so let us keep it alive
(Keep it alive, keep it alive)
(Tonight)
I'm starting to see the morning light
We finally worked this out

[Intro: Nick Jonas]
What do you say we play another one from the old record?
I'm gonna need you to sing along to the next song
It's called, "When You Look Me In the Eyes"

[Intro: Nick Jonas]
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
If the heart is always searching
Can you ever find a home?
I've been looking for that someone
I'll never make it on my own
Dreams can't take the place of loving you
There's gotta be a million reasons why it's true

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
How long will I be waiting
To be with you again?
I'm gonna tell you that I love you
In the best way that I can
I can't take a day without you here
You're the light that makes my darkness disappear

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
And I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

[Bridge: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
More and more, I start to realize
I can reach my tomorrow
I can hold my head up high
And it's all because you're by my side

[Breakdown: Nick Jonas with Crowd]
When you look me in the eyes
You tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When I hold you in my arms
I know that it's forever
I just gotta let you know
I never wanna let you go

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side
When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
Oh, I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
Oh, yeah
Oh, whoa, yeah
Thank you, thank you so much

[Verse 1: SZA]
Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
Get some air now, let yo edge out
Too soon, I spoke
You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?
I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you
Baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit

[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent"
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

[Chorus: SZA, Jacob Collier & Both]
All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always
Always inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind

[Verse 2: SZA, Jacob Collier]
Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations
I disappear if you let me
Feelin' like, yeah (On your own)
Feelin' like Jericho
Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit
Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I
Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood
Know you like that shit
Can't groove it, ba-baby
Heavy on my empty mind shit

[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (Rest of me)
Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent" (It's urgent)
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind (My mind)
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

[Chorus: SZA, Jacob Collier & Both]
All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always (Good days on my mind, good days on my mind)
Sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind

[Verse 3: SZA]
Gotta get right
Tryna free my mind before the end of the world
I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text
I choose not to respond
I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened
Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present
(Na-na, na-na, na-na, na)
Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now

[Outro: Jacob Collier]
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
You've been making me feel like I'm
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind

[Verse 1]
No one knows, knows where my mind goes
I keep you on the low, I must confess
I've been painting us, the picture makes me blush
My imagination at its best

[Pre-Chorus]
I could put us on an island
I could put us in a mansion
I could put us in a back seat, yeah
You're anywhere I want you to be

[Chorus]
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby
I keep you tucked away inside my head
Where I can find you anytime I want to, baby

[Post-Chorus]
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
No, they'll never know about us
Na, na, na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
As long as I keep you tucked

[Verse 2]
Tucked deep, deep in my fantasy
'Cause, in reality, we're a mistake
Don't need permission to do what I do to you
When all you are to me's a sweet escape

[Pre-Chorus]
I could put us on an island
I could put us in a mansion
I could put us in a back seat, yeah
You're anywhere I want you to be

You're someone that I should forget
Oh, woah, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
It's not the end of the world
No, not the end of the world
Throw on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Don’t lose hope
It's no funeral we're attending
Actually, just the beginning
Throw on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Don’t lose hope
It's not the end of the, no, not the end of the world

[Verse 1]
You can catch a star if the sky is falling down
There's a golden lining up in every single cloud
You can take a frown, turn it all the way around
All the way around, all the, all the way around
A fortune teller told me, "The power's in your mind"
You might see a cliff, but I see a way to fly
Flipping off the flop, now I just enjoy the ride
Just enjoy the ride, yeah, I just enjoy the ride

[Pre-Chorus]
(Na, na, na, na) What a time
(Na, na, na, na) To be alive
(Don't say goodbye)

It's not the end of the world
No, not the end of the world
Throw on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Don't lose hope
It's no funeral we’re attending
Actually, just the beginning
Throw on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Don’t lose hope
It's not the end of the, no, not the end of the world

[Verse 2]
You can make a wish even on a satellite
On a plastic lash or anything you like
You can tame the dragon if you’re not afraid to fight
Not afraid to fight, no, I'm not afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
(Na, na, na, na) What a time
(Na, na, na, na) To be alive
(Don't say goodbye) Don't say goodbye

[Chorus]
It’s not the end of the world
No, not the end of the world
Throw on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Don't lose hope
It's no funeral we're attending
Actually, just the beginning
Throw on your fancy attire, fears in the fire
Don't lose hope

Busy at the crib, cookin' salmon with the lobster
If we talkin' joints, it's just me and David Foster
Bodyguards don't look like Kevin Costner, you tweakin'
Just pulled up to Whitney Houston, Texas for the evenin'
They tell the same story so much, they start to believe it
The ones that start like, "Drizzy's shit was cool, but we even"
Man, how the fuck?
Two, four, six, eight watches, factory, so they appreciate
Crown in my hand and I'm really playin' keep-away

Over and over again

[Open Verse]
Verse 1

This English morning
This English dawning
That I’m up against
This English yearning
This constant burning
Yet I’m on the fence
I’m always changing
Rearranging to another man
This ceaseless scheming
This breathless screaming
But do I take a stand
No

Chorus

And when your back’s
Against the wall
Well, endless screaming’s
The only thing
That makes sense at all
Verse 2

These shifting feelings
This hingeless reeling
Written on my face
This wingless yearning
This stifled burning
For another place
My madman’s raving his
Stark mad wailings
At my brand new man
The past is calling
The engine’s stalling
But do I take a stand
No

Chorus

And when your back’s
Against the wall
Well, endless screaming’s
The only thing
That makes sense at all

Bridge
And when your backs against the wall
I couldn’t save anything
Is there anything above
Is there anything but love

Chorus

And when your back’s
Against the wall
Well, endless screaming’s
The only thing
That makes sense at all

Outro

Is there a pattern to understand
Is there a lantern to hold in hand
Is there a ladder to climb above

[Intro]
I don't think they're ready for this one
Darkchild, I like that

[Verse 1]
My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed
The way I walk
The way I talk
I cannot explain these things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you'll need

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels so right (Girl)
I've searched for the perfect love all my life (All my life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels like I (Like I)
Have finally found her perfect love is mine (See)
And I finally found, come on, girl

[Chorus]

You rocked my world, you know you did (Girl)
And everything I own I give (Come on, girl)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

[Verse 2]
In time I knew that love would bring
This happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I waited patiently
Girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think that I (Oh)
Have finally found the perfect love I searched for all my life
(Searched for all my life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think I'd find

And girl, I'll never get enough
That's why I always have to have you here, hoo

[Verse 1]
I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feeling insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittling me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me

[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

[Verse 2]
Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was dogging me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came and again, and again, and again
Take my name and just let me

[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

[Outro]
Like a stranger in Moscow
Lord have mercy
Like a stranger in Moscow
Lord have mercy
We're talking danger
We're talking danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
We're talking danger
We're talking danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
I'm living lonely
I'm living lonely, baby
Stranger in Moscow

[KGB interrogator - Russian to English Translation]
Why have you come from the West
Confess, to steal the great achievements of the people
The accomplishments of the worker

[Murdoc]
Oh my, we're back.

[Russel]
You've been digging that hole for three days.

[Murdoc]
Yeah, I can't find anything though, what's the point? Ugh.

Uh, what? Oh dear.

You feel me? 'Cause he didn't have no jam, of course.

[2-D]
Oh.

[Russel]
Then he put the track down, he liked to jam, yeah.

[2-D]
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, when he said he liked to jam, I didn't know what he meant. I—

[Murdoc]
You misunderstood because you went and got him some of the—

[2-D]
A guitar.

[Russel]
Don't put jam on the beat. Put Q on the beat.

[2-D]
Yeah
Don't say goodbye to me
There is no need to
Don't say goodbye to me cause I'm still with you
Don't say goodbye to me

There was a time that you could tell me that the sky was purple
And I'll say ''wow, you're right, outta sight''
Tell me that the sun was shining in the middle of the darkest night
And I say ''yeah, you're right''

Now you went and got that lil funky ass job
Went and bought yourself that lil funky ass car
Now can't nobody tell you nothing
I don't see you no more
Now your attitude is so funky

You say ''let's'', I say ''go''
You say ''no'', I say ''no''
And I didn't even ask the questions ''why?, why?, why?''

Now you's the boss gettin' that bread

Cared when you needed somebody
Now you wanna act a fool

[Verse 1]
I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feeling insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittling me
Stalin’s tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me

[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you’re cold inside?

[Verse 2]
Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was dogging me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came and again, and again, and again
Take my name and just let me

[Chorus]
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

[Outro]
Like a stranger in Moscow
Lord have mercy
Like a stranger in Moscow
Lord have mercy
We're talking danger
We're talking danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
We're talking danger
We're talking danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
I'm living lonely
I’m living lonely, baby
Stranger in Moscow

[KGB interrogator - Russian to English Translation]
Why have you come from the West
Confess, to steal the great achievements of the people
The accomplishments of the worker

[Intro]
It's not supposed to be happenin' now
What is she callin' about?
What you doin'?
I have no idea

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Oh, pull up, door open
I ain't gotta say much (Oh woah, ooh woah, ooh woah)
They be tryna catch up
New whip, that's us
Bad bitch, she rollin' up
No time for the player haters
On my grind, I can't lay up

[Verse 1: Bootsyano]
I think rich, so I gotta keep my bucks long
Thousand dollar fits but still got some blue Chucks on
You gon' jog or you gon' stampede?
We in the diamond lane, breaded, all my niggas smell like good leaves
Bitch that back talk, I love the way she badass
We be on the grind, full speed, I need an asset
I'm in a circle full of cold niggas
Don't gotta say much, we pull up, the dips is gon' roll with us
Doors open up like Lamborghini
She a light weight she with it, she gon' go up off a Martini
I need it all, don't want the half, I don't slow step
We be in the foreign, she gon' bob until her throat stretch

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Oh, pull up, door open
I ain't gotta say much (Oh woah, ooh woah, ooh woah)
They be tryna catch up
New whip, that's us
Bad bitch, she rollin' up
No time for the players, haters
On my grind (Okay), I can't lay up

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
If they only knew, what that thing do
See a million dollars everytime I think of you
Take my business to the top, dream come true
Want me to drop the top, no clouds, sky blue
Red sixty-one or sixty-nine, Skyblue
Pull up on Snoop, watch a movie when we drive through
Get you some ice, pull it out, you look surprised
A real winner, I can see it in your eyes
Don't make our moves too fast 'cause we strategize
Grade A, G-shit, when they categorize
Spend that money then your picture off in private
Put some diamonds on my wrist, that's perfect timin'

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Oh, pull up, door open (Haha)
I ain't gotta say much (Oh woah, ooh woah, ooh woah)
They be tryna catch up
(Don't compete with each other, man
Y'all just do the same thing, y'all get the same shit, haha)
New whip, that's us
Bad bitch, she rollin' up
No time for the players, haters
On my grind, I can't lay up

[Verse 1]
I've always liked you and you've always known
But I've been shy, I've always lied
These feelings are powerful, they grow and grow
Wait wait in line, now it's the time

[Pre-Chorus]
You are the target, gonna take my aim, I'll take my aim
I shoot to kill, my success record's one hundred percent
I'm acting crazy, baby, I'm about to do something
You won't ever forget

[Chorus]
Don't go, don't speak
My heart is beating loud and I can't hold it down
You're all I need
I'm moving in real close, so I can say hello
What's up, whats up?
What's up, whats up?
What's up, whats up?
We know you know you're on my mind
The second you caught my eye
I was like what's up, what's up?

[Verse 2]
I'm coming forward to tell you the truth
You are my drug, got me fucked up
Hope that you feel the same way that I do
More than a crush
It could be love

[Pre-Chorus]
You are the target, gonna take my aim, I'll take my aim
I shoot to kill, my success record's one hundred percent
I'm acting crazy, baby, I'm about to do something
You won't ever forget

[Chorus]
Don't go, don't speak
My heart is beating loud and I can't hold it down
You're all I need
I'm I'm moving in real close, so I can say hello
What's up, whats up?
What's up, whats up?

We know you know you're on my mind

[Bridge]
What's up, what's up?

[Chorus]
Don't go, don't speak
My heart is beating loud and I can't hold it down
You're all I need
I'm moving in real close, so I can say hello
What's up, what's up? (Let me know)
What's up, what's up? (I'ma take control)
What's up, what's up?
We know you know you're on my mind
From the second you caught my eye
I was like what's up, what's up?

[Chorus]
We can start a fire, we can explode tonight
This is ecstasy, electricity
Blow me away
You you, you blow me away
We can start a fire, you're the gasoline
I'm the matchstick, light me, baby
Blow me away, uh-uh-uh
I'm the matchstick, light me, baby
Blow me away (Blow me away, blow me away)
You you, you blow me away
I'll make you stayin' up

[Verse]
Sparks and stars are dancing right upon my skin
I just wanna pull you in
I'm craving something that I've never had before
And it's in your eyes
I need you blazing through my bones tonight
I feel you coming, oh, you're driving me wild

[Chorus]
We can start a fire, we can explode tonight
This is ecstasy, electricity
Blow me away
You you, you blow me away
We can start a fire, you're the gasoline

[Bridge]
Head is spinning, overloading, melting down
But these flames are never dying out
You are the sun and I'm the moon, we're way high above the clouds
Painted in silver and gold
Uh-uh-uh
Now that you're blazing through me, I'm alive
You got it
You got that magic, makes me go so bright
Lost my mind

[Chorus]
We can start a fire, let's can explode tonight
This is ecstasy, electricity
Blow me away
You you, you blow me away
We can start a fire, you're the gasoline
I'm the matchstick, light me, baby
Blow me away, uh-uh-uh

Blow me away (Blow me away, blow me away)
You you, you blow me away

[Verse 1]
Feeling lovesick, feeling stoned
I got some secrets in my head
Wish I could just let you know
I think about you every day

[Pre-Chorus]
I just want to lock you here inside my bedroom
Get tangled in the wires from my headphones
But I'm a ghost, I'll always be nothing
You're walking though, wish you were listening

[Chorus]
'Bout to explode
I lost all control
Where you go, I will follow
You go, and I will follow
The truth will unfold
I love you so
Where you go, I will follow
You go, and I will follow

[Verse 2]
Wish you just opened your eyes
Turn around and see me here
'Cause I'll always be behind
I'm kinda hooked on you for real

[Pre-Chorus]
Just want to get up close and feel your blood beat
Then wrap you up like snow inside my bed sheets
But I'm a ghost, I don't mean anything
You're walking through, wish you were listening

[Chorus]
'Bout to explode
I lost all control
Where you go, I will follow
You go, and I will follow
The truth will unfold
I love you so
Where you go, I will follow
You go, and I will follow

[Bridge]
Me and myself and I are best of friends, yeah
It's alright
And it's the way it's gonna stay for the rest of my life

[Chorus]
'Bout to explode
I lost all control
Where you go, I will follow
You go, and I will follow
The truth will unfold
I love you so
Where you go, I will follow
You go, and I will follow
Some boat's gone out fishing, some boat's high and dry
Some boat's on a mission to the lonely Lorelei
Some folk's got a vision of a castle in the sky
And I'm left stranded, wondering why
I don't need a rowboat, I don't need a wood
Even if I get a medal from my local neighborhood
I won't need a castle, they've got castles in Versailles
And I'm still stranded, wondering why

Things can go wrong, things can go right
Things can go bump in the dead of the night
Let me be there, let me be there
Let me be there with you in the dead of the night

Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers in love to behold
Make it a beautiful night for me
It's such a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers in love to behold
Some boat's on the ocean, we're here in the room
Seems to me the perfect way to end an afternoon
We can look for castles, castles in the sky
No more wondering, wondering why

Things can go wrong, things can go right
Things can go bump in the dead of the night
Let me be there, let me be there
Let me be there with you in the dead of the night

Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Make it a beautiful night for me
It's such a beautiful night for love
Make it a wonderful sight, oh, make it a wonderful night for me

Make it a beautiful night for me
It's such a beautiful night for love
What a wonderful sight for lovers in love to behold
Make it, make it a beautiful night for me
It's such a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold

Make it a beautiful night for me
And I'll make it a beautiful night for you
Such a wonderful sight for lovers in love to behold
Make it a beautiful night
Oh, it's a beautiful night for love
What a wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Oh, it's a beautiful night for love
It's a beautiful night for me
Make it all right, make it all right for me, yeah
Don't do that one time, all right babe

[Interlude: The Kid LAROI & Devenity Perkins]
Yo, what's up?
Like this is literally how our conversations go
Tell me this doesn't sound weird
If you were a girl, you would think this shit was weird
You're gonna text me, "Good morning," we don't talk all day, right?
You'll text me around, mmm, probably eleven or twelve
When you feel like responding
Wanting me to come over, you come over, like, like, that shit's so weird
And then again, I don't text you through the whole day
But then I'll text you at night, and then you'll come over, like what?
Like literally a booty call
That is the definition of a booty call and a ho and I am not a ho
So, I'm not dealing with that, like that's bullshit
Like I have shit happening
I do things too, like, I still find the time for you, though
And if you don't wanna find the time for me, that is totally okay
Just, like, don't lead me on or whatever, like that's just fucked up
Like, I don't deserve that, I'm sorry, but like what?

[Interlude: Devenity Perkins & Voicemail]
You have one new voice message
First voice message
Are you fucking serious?
You had Alyssa over there?
I saw her picture in your fucking bathroom
You can't say that's not your fucking bathroom
I see the gray towels and I see the cologne in your background
You're a fucking piece of shit, Charlton
That's been my friend since the sixth fucking grade, I hate you
I hope you die

[Interlude: The Kid LAROI & Tyler Armstrong]
What's up?
Where you at? What are you doin'? I miss you
Who this?
LAROI
Hah (Who the fuck is this?), LAROI?
My girl told me 'bout you and your weak ass mixtape, fuckboy
Don't call this number no more, hah

[Interlude: The Kid LAROI & Devenity Perkins]
That's crazy, this is what you wanna do?
Are you serious? This is what you did
I'm sorry, but Tyler is nice and he does everything that you wouldn't
Like, bro, you fucked with my friend
I really did want this to work, Charlton, but Tyler just treats me better
I'm sorry, I can't do this anymore
I really do wish you the best though

‘Cause you came around, knocked me off my feet
And you’ve been in my brain for the past two weeks

Wanna lose control
Feel good and so damn beautiful
Gonna spend it all

I got the flashing lights
Chandeliers and limousines, in a dream

Airplanes and luxury, can't you see?
We just got payed so we're ’bout that money

All these bitches looking at me
Tell me, do you like what you see? (Woo)

I got the flashing lights (Lights)
Chandeliers and limousines, in a dream
And we're never going home
'Cause we're up so high (So high)
Airplanes and luxury, can't you see?
We just got payed so we're 'bout that money

[Billie Jean]

[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (Woo)
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
(Hee hee hee, no no, hee hee hee, ooh)

[Thriller]

[Verse 1]
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops you hearts
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus]
‘Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller (Woo hoo), thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller

[Wanna Be Startin Somethin]

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin

Too low to get under(yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)
It's too hight to get over (yeah, yeah)
And too low to get under (yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)

[Beat It]

They told him don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it

[Chorus]
Beat it (Beat it), beat it (Beat it)
No one wants to be defeated

[Verse 1]
Don't sleep until the sunrise, listen to the falling rain
Don't worry about tomorrow, don't worry about your pain
Don't cry unless you're happy, don't smile unless you're blue
Never let that lonely monster take control of you

[Chorus]
Be glad that you are free
Free to change your mind
Free to go most anywhere, anytime
Be glad that you are free
There's many a man who's not
Be glad for what you had, baby, what you've got
Be glad for what you've got

[Verse 2]
I know your heart is beating, my drummer tells me so
If you take your life for granted, your beating heart will go
So don't sleep until you're guilty, because sinners all are we
There's others doing far worse than us, so be glad that you are free

[Chorus]
Be glad that you are free
Free to change your mind
Free to go most anywhere, anytime
Be glad that you are free
There's many a man who's not
Be glad for what you had, baby, what you've got
Be glad for what you've got

[Bridge]
Soldiers are a-marching, they're writing brand new laws
Will we all fight together for the most important cause?
Will we all fight for the right to be free?

Free

Free to go most anywhere, anytime

[Verse 1]
I guess I should've known by the way you parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last
See, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
I guess I must be dumb 'cuz you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used

[Pre-Chorus]
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say - "What have I got to lose?"

[Chorus]
And honey, I say Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast (Oh)
Little Red Corvette
You need a love that's gonna last

[Verse 2]
I guess I should've closed my eyes when you drove me to the place
Where your horses run free
'Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me
Believe it or not, I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class

[Pre-Chorus]
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say, "Baby, have you got enough gas?"
Oh yeah!

[Chorus]
Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
(Yes you are)
Little Red Corvette
You need to find a love that's gonna last
(Oh, oh)

[Verse 3]
A body like yours oughta be in jail
'Cause it's on the verge of bein' obscene
Move over, baby, gimme the keys
I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine

[Chorus]
Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
Little Red Corvette
Need to find a love that's gonna last, hey hey

[Chorus]
Little Red Corvette
Honey, you got to slow down (Got to slow down)
Little Red Corvette
'Cause if you don't, you're gonna run your little red Corvette right in the ground

Right down to the ground (Honey, you got to slow down)
You, you, you got to slow down

You're movin' much too fast, too fast
Need to find a love that's gonna last

[Breakdown]
Girl, you got an ass like I never seen, ow!
And the ride
I say the ride is so smooth, you must be a limousine
Ow!

[Chorus]
Baby, you're much too fast
Little Red Corvette
You need a love, you need a love that's, uh, that's gonna last
(Little Red Corvette)

[Chorus]
Babe, you got to slow down (you got to slow down)

'Cause if you don't, 'cause if you don't
You're gonna run your body right into the ground (Right into the ground)
Right into the ground (Right into the ground)
Right into the ground (Right into the ground)

[Verse 1]
You can dance if you want to
All the critics love You in New York
You don't have to keep the beat
They'll still think it's neat
In New York
You can wear what you want to, it doesn't matter
In New York
You could cut off all your hair
I don't think they'd care
In New York

[Refrain]
All the critics love you in New York

[Verse 2]
Why you can play what you want to
All the critics love you in New York
They won't say that you're naive
If you play what you believe
In New York
Purple love-amour
Is all you're headed for
But don't show it
The reason that you're cool
Is because you're from the old school, and they know it

[Refrain]
All the critics love you in New York

[Interlude]
You can dance if you want to
All the critics love you in New York
You can dance if you want to
All the critics love you in New York

[Refrain]
All the critics love you
All the critics love you

[Bridge]
It's time for a new direction
It's time for jazz to die
Fourth day of November
We need a purple high
Don't give up, I'll still love you

All the critics love you in New York
All the critics love you in New York
All the critics love you
All the critics love you
All the critics love you in New York

[Verse 1]
Lady cab driver, can you take me for a ride?
Don't know where I'm going 'cause I don't know where I've been
So just put your foot on the gas, let's drive
Lady, don't ask questions
Promise I'll tell you no lies
Trouble winds are blowing, I'm growing cold
Get me out of here, I feel I'm going to die

[Chorus]
Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast
Lately trouble winds are blowing hard, and I don't know if I can last

[Verse 2]
Lady, I'm so lonely
I know that's not the way to be
Don't want isolation, but the air it makes me cold
Drive it, baby, drive it, drive this demon out of me
Take me to your mansion
Honey, let's go everywhere
Help me, girl, I'm drowning, mass confusion in my head
Will you accept my tears to pay the fare?

[Chorus]
Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast
Lately trouble winds are blowing hard, and I don't know if I can last
Oh-oh

[Interlude]
Lady cab driver, can you take me for a ride?

[Chorus]
Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast
Lately trouble winds are blowing hard, and I don't know if I can last

[Breakdown]
This is for the cab you have to drive for no money at all
This is for why I wasn't born like my brother, handsome and tall
This is for politicians who are bored and believe in war
This - Yeah, that's for me, that's who that one's for
This is for discrimination and egotists who think supreme
And this is for whoever taught you how to kiss in designer jeans
(Ugh) That one's for- That one's for- for you have to live
This one's for the rich, not all of 'em, just the greedy -
The ones that don't know how to give
This one's for Yosemite Sam and the tourists at Disneyland
And this one- Ooh! Yeah - That's the one
That's for- that's for the- the creator of man
This is for the sun, the moon, the stars, the tourists at Disneyland
This is for the ocean, the sea, the shore
This is for- and that's for you, and that's who that one's for
This is for the women, so beautifully complex
This one's for love without sex
This is for the wind that blows no matter how fast or slow
Not knowing where I'm going
This galaxy's better than not having a place to go
And now I know (I know)

[Outro]

Because I get delirious

Because I get delirious, yeah
Delirious

[Verse 3]
I get delirious whenever you're near
Girl you gotta take control because I just can't steer
You're just too much to take

Girl you got to take me for a little ride up and down
In and out and around your lake

[Chorus]
I'm delirious
You, you, you get me delirious
Baby, lay me down
Delirious
The room, the room, the room is spinning around (Delirious)
Yeah, I'm delirious, yeah, oh I'm, oh I'm

You ask me if I love you
It's automatic

Don't say no man has ever tasted your ice cream
Baby, you're the purple star in the night supreme
You'll always be a virgin for no man deserves your love
I only pray that when you dream, I'm the one you dream of
I pray that when you dream, you dream of how we kissed
Not with our lips but with our souls
Stop me if I bore you
Why is it that I think we'd be so good in bed?
Can you hear me? Why do I love you so much?
It's so strange, I'm more comfortable around you when I'm naked
Can you hear me?
I wonder if you have any mercy, don't torture me
Stop the music baby, automatic fool
When it comes to you I'm automatic baby
There's no one else like me
I'm the best you'll ever find
No one else could understand you, you're too complex
They say nothing's perfect, but they don't know you
That's automatic too
Can you hear me? (A-U-T-O-matic)
Yes, I'm addicted to your pleasure
I'm addicted to your pain
It's automatic (A-U-T-O-matic)
Automatically insane
Undress me (A-U-T-O-matic)

Hey
Fasten your seat belts
Prepare for take-off
(I remember how you kissed me)
(Not with your lips but with your soul)
(With you I'm never bored, talk to me some more)
(I can hear you, I'm going to have to torture you now)
Excuse me but I need a mouth like yours
To help me forget the girl that just walked out my door
Funny but it seems that you're alone like me
If you are, go let's come see what we can see

Ooh, little darlin' if you're
Free for a couple of hours (Free for a couple of hours)
If you ain't busy for the next seven years (Next seven years)

I wanna fuck you so bad it hurts, it hurts, it hurts
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna fuck you
Yeah, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna wanna, I wanna fuck you

Whatever you heard about me is true
I change the rules and do what I wanna do
I'm in love with God, he's the only way
'Cuz you and I know we gotta die some day
If you think I'm crazy, you're probably right
But I'm gonna have fun every motherfuckin' night
If you like to fight, you're a double-drag fool
I'm goin' to another life, how 'bout you

[Verse 1]
Excuse me but I need a mouth like yours
To help me forget the girl that just walked out my door
Funny but it seems that you're alone like me

[Chorus]
Ooh, little darlin' if you're
Free for a couple of hours (Free for a couple of hours)
If you ain't busy for the next seven years (Next seven years)

Let's pretend we're married and go all night, tonight

Work your body like a whore

People everywhere, loosen up your hair
Take a deeper breath and sing along with me, yes
Are you ready?

[Verse 2]
Everybody (everybody), Loosen up
Shake it like you just don't care (Shake it like you just don't care)
Never mind your friends
Girl, it ain't no sin
To strip right down to your underwear

I say everybody, mmm (everybody)
Screw the masses
We only want to have some fun (I only wanna have some fun)
I say do whatever we want
Wear lingerie to a restaurant
Police ain't got no gun
You don't have to run

I don't wanna be a poet
'Cuz I don't wanna blow it
I don't care to win awards
All I wanna do is dance (yeah)
Play music, sex, romance
And try my best to never get bored (oh)
If you feel all right lemme hear you scream
Yeeeah!

[Verse 1]
You got a slurpie for free
I caught you looking at me in the 7/11
Under florescent lights
We walked in comfy silence
Footsteps down familiar sidewalk
Knowing that we were here in our dreams last night

[Chorus]
All my ghosts are with me
I know you feel them too
Riding shotgun next to your free slurpie
They know all of my habits
But they don't know about you
I hope that's true
Mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verse 2]
We made sangria it failed
I spilled mac n cheese on my pants
And thought about kissing you underneath kitchen lights

[Chorus]
Oh all my ghosts are with me
I know you feel them too
Oh they just stand there while were taking shots of brandy
They know all of my habits
But they don't know about you
I hope that's true

[Bridge]
I can see it now
The wedding of the year
I can see it now
He stands up there and wipes his tears
I can see it now
And all my ghosts disappear
I can see it crystal clear

[Outro]
You got a slurpie for free
I caught you looking at me in the 7/11
Under florescent lights
And all my ghosts were with me
I know you felt them too
Watching us I started to get dizzy
'Cause I hate all of my habits
But I happen to love you
I know that's true

[Verse 1]
This thing we got,  it's alive
It seems to transcend the physical
One touch and I'm satisfied
Must be a dream it's so magical

[Chorus]
Glam Slam thank you ma'am
You really make my day
Glam Slam thank you ma'am
I pray you'll always stay

[Verse 2]
I know I hold you too tight
But I just can't seem to get close enough
(I want to hold you)
I want to hold you every night
I'm so horny and you're the stuff

[Chorus]
Glam Slam thank you ma'am
You really make my day
Glam Slam thank you ma'am
I pray you'll always stay

[Verse 3]
This thing we got, it's alive
It seems to transcend the physical
One touch and I'm satisfied
Must be a dream it's so magical

[Chorus]
Glam Slam thank you ma'am
You really make my day
Glam Slam thank you ma'am
I pray you'll always stay

[Outro]
Glam Slam
You will always stay
You will always stay
It's all right, it's OK

[Verse 1: AJ & Brian]
I love you with everything that's in me
Did you know that?
You'll be the first that's ever been so close
You should know that
I've been loving you since the beginning
For what it's worth
I've always been waiting for this moment

[Chorus: All]
One special night for one special girl
Let’s make love like it’s our last day on Earth
With everything I am
I promise it will be much sweeter
Than you ever could dream
Let’s do it tonight, baby
Let’s do it for love (do it for love)

[Verse 2: Kevin & Nick]
Never had a reason to believe that
Love would find me
It must've known something that I didn't know
And you shown me
That if I had a chance to go to heaven
Girl, I'd stay here
'Cause nothing can make me miss this moment

[Chorus: All & (AJ)]
One special night (one special night)
For one special girl (for one special girl)
Let’s make love like it’s our last day on Earth
With everything I am
I promise it will be much sweeter
Than you ever could dream
Let’s do it tonight, baby (let's do it tonight, baby)
Let’s do it for love (do it for love)

[Bridge: AJ, (Howie), Nick & All]
I can't think of any place
I'd rather be than here with you
When I hold you close to me
Feeling every pound of your heartbeat, baby
(It's the way you look into my eyes)
Then, let me know just want you wish
It's for a night like this, like this

[Chorus: All, (AJ), Brian & Nick]
One special night (oh, yeah)
For one special girl (one special girl)
Let’s make love (let's make love, let's make love)
Like it’s our last day on Earth (last day on Earth)
With everything I am (everything I am)
I promise it will be (I promise it will be)
Much sweeter than you ever could dream (oh, come on, baby)
Let’s do it tonight, baby (let's do it tonight, baby)
Let’s do it for love (do it for love)

[Outro: Howie]
Let's do it tonight, baby
Let's do it for love (do it for love)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Boy, I ain't waitin' 'round
I ain't waitin' 'round for some handouts (Handouts)
I'ma always stand out, always stand out
That's hands down (Hands down, woo)
Better tell them boys, better tell them boys
Tell 'em "Stand down" (Stand down)
And that boy soft as hell, hell
'Till he got his man 'round (Man 'round)

[Verse: Kanye West & Royce Da 5'9]
Boy behave, ayy, Kobe, ayy, ayy
See the reason why they set him up
'Cause he ain't no slave, ayy
Swear the game cut throat
Cosby, set up, what? Shut up boy, shut up
Our lord has the bandwidth (Da, da, nah)
Please bless us with the bandwidth (Doo, doo, doo)
Stand with him, he a stand in
We just heard the new Black Star, it's a good time to be a black star
We the children, we the vision, Daytona, going NASCAR
Biden said you ain't black if you ain't vote for me and I ain't vote for him, so is that basis to cancel my black card?
'Cept for when Mom visit me ('Cept for when Mom visit me)
I can hear her whisperin', not too long, just visitin'
Finally in a position that they can't impeach
Finally a transition, I was once chained like tennis piece
He must want me to run, that's why I'm in this positionin'
God must want me the one, Holy Ghost and his Son

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Boy, I ain't waitin' 'round
I ain't waitin' 'round for some handouts (Handouts)
I'ma always stand out, always stand out
That's hands down (Hands down, woo)
Better tell them boys, better tell them boys
Tell 'em "Stand down" (Stand down)
And that boy soft as hell, hell
'Till he got his man 'round (Man 'round)

[Intro: Kanye West & KayCyy]
Ooh, ooh
Keep my spirit alive
Keep my spirit alive, alive

[Chorus: Kanye West]
More than anything
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
Spirit won't die, die
Oh, oh, my life
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Yo
Flushed the work just in time and they raided, thank God (Thank God)
Screamin' through the GT roof like ****, we done made it, thank God (Thank God)
Hundred-round drum didn't jam when my shooter tried to spray it, thank God (Thank God)
Couple thousand grams, got two thousand grands when we waited, thank God (Thank God)
I was facin' fifteen and I beat it (And I beat it)
Just spent about twenty up at Neimans (Up at Neimans)
Did two hundred in a Demon (In a Demon, skrrt)
I'm the illest **** and I mean it (And I mean it)
My homie droppin' bodies for no reason (Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
Now his kids see him on the weekends (Ah)
Got the baking soda for the remix (Remix)
Millionaires on, I can see it

[Chorus: Kanye West]
More than anything
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
Spirit won't die, die
Oh, oh, my life
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize

[Verse 2: Conway the Machine]
Yeah, don't hate me, 'cause my heart is full of love
No weapon formed against me 'cause I'm covered in the blood
Layin' in the hospital when I got shot, fam
Mama prayed for me, said she left it in God's hands, yeah
So I'ma leave it in God's hands
Everything I'm doin' now is God's plan
Doctor said I wouldn't walk no more, now I stand
Then I ran, here I am, Machine

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Keep my spirit alive, alive
More than anything
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Royce da 5'9"]
Well, between a mix of bad schools with the fast food
Bad had tools and a bad mood
If you don't turn to a lil' Gotti, they gon' drain all the strength in your lil' body
They turned me into a lil' Gotti, uh, yeah
Not Wakanda but Wakanda is kinda like what we 'bout to make
And who gon' make it? Kan', duh
Who the squad? Donda
Who the mom? Donda
Who can see? Don, duh, get Don C
Who needs practice? I don't do rehearsals
And I don't do commercials, 'cause they too commercial
Give it all to God and let Jesus reimburse you
She said "You in the studio with who? I'ma hurt you"
How I'm forty-two and you got a curfew?
How nerves dictate how they gon' curve you?
Quiet all the cordialness
We walk in God's spiritual ordinance
We know the Blacks, the orphans refused to be runaways
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid

[Chorus: Kanye West]
More than anything
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
Spirit won't die, die
Oh, oh, my life
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize

It ain't up to you no more
God's Country, this is war
Hold up son, I make it storm
Rolex on, I make it pour
It ain't up to you no more
God's Country, this is war
We was quiet when he rose
I've been talkin' to the boss
I'ma talk to you

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Wakin' up, I see the light, I been up and it's alright
See they leapin' up my legion, I teared it up and it’s a pipe
Leave it up, I got it on, tear it up and watch 'em fall…

[Chorus]
Well, Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me
Wrap Your arms around with Your mercy
Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me

[Verse]
When you said give me a ring, you really meant a ring, huh?
Turned out to be more than just a fling, huh?
Three hours to get back from Palm Springs, huh?
Who you know spend an hour in Walgreens, huh?
You know you'll always be my favorite prom queen
Even when we in dad shoes or mom jeans
Too many complaints made it hard for me to think
Would you shut up? I can't hear myself drink
We used to do the freak like seven days a week
It's the best collab since Taco Bell and KFC, uh
Talk to me nicely, don't come at me loud
You had a Benz at sixteen, I could barely afford a Audi
How you gon' try to say sometimes it's not about me?
Man, I don't know what I would do without me
Billionaire sport, step up to the court
They rented a room, we bought the resort
God got me, baby, God got the children
The devil run the playground, but God own the buildin'
Time and silence a luxury
Cussin' at your baby mama, guess that's why they call it custody
God got us, baby, God got the children
The devil run the playground, but God own the buildin'
Time and space is a luxury
But you came here to show that you still in love with me
Startin' to feel like you ain't been happy for me lately, darlin'
'Member when you used to come around and serenade me, woah
But I guess it's gone different in a different direction lately
Tryna do the right thing with the freedom that you gave me (Wheezy outta here)
Your gun off safety
Speak first, don't break me
Harsh words, you're angry
Lord, don't take me, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Well, Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me
Wrap Your arms around with Your mercy
Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me
I give up on doin' things my way
And tell me everything's gonna be alright, oh (Wheezy outta here)

[Intro]
Nebuchadnezzar's dreams
And in the second year of the rain of Nebuchadnezzar
Nebuchadnezzar dreamed, dreams
Where with his spirit was trouble
And his sleep break from him
Then the command, then the king commanded to call the magicians
And the astrologers and the sorcerers
And the chaldeans
For to shew the king His dreams
So they came and stood before the king
Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams where his spirit was troubled
And his sleep break from him (Wooh, ah, ah, ah, ohh)
Nebuchadnezzar dreamed, dreams where his spirit was troubled
And his sleep break from him (Woah, ah, ah, ah, ah, woah)

Look at new scenes, I opened my life, I'm subject to memes
I signed a few ****, I polished their dreams
An angel on earth, come under my wing
Stop runnin' your publishers, ****
They publish the headlines and say the wrong things
Y'all treat your Lord and Savior like renters' insurance, you know what I mean?
Bada the bada the boom, I bada the boom, I bada the bing
I need a new girl, my old one was mean
I had to let go, forgave all them evils that came to my shows
I channeled them bad **** all in abode
I channeled your trust, I channeled the turbulence, came with the life
I gathered my sinners and asked if I'm right, let's get
I just get right, ****, huh
Let's get right, let's get right, let's get right, shh, shh
Ain't on sight, it's on sight
I don't know you, you, you, you, it's on sight
I don't know you, you, you, you (Ayy, ayy), let's get right
Ayy, all of my **** on Channel 5
I don't channel ten 'til it go time
Used to throw up my uncle's spaghetti
Been told to tote since before I was ready
Back when my mama told me that I was challenged
A single Black woman, you know that she petty
I turned a heavy heart to two million dollars
I put that in totals, reverse outta debty
I gotta, I gotta put on a rager one time
I swung the powder, went major one time
I know some white people servin' no time
I gotta do it for me, do it for, pray for me
Do it for all the ones dyin'
I wanna do it for all the ones cryin'
I wanna, uh, uh, uh, let's get right, huh

[Intro: Kanye West]
It's after hours at that glamorous blind spot
Where they're taking it easy, swapping personal experiences
Let's listen in America Today
Life of the party, mhm, 'til I almost cry, mhm
It's the life of the party to think I could've almost died
Lord, help us

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Hey, Miss Donda
You run into my mama; please tell her I said, "Say something"
I'm startin' to believe ain't no such thing as heaven's trumpets
No after-over, this is it, done
If there's a Heaven, you would think they'd let ya speak to your son
Maybe she has in the form of a baby's laugh I heard
Passing by in a stroller remindin' me, "Hey, keep rolling"
I don't know; maybe she has with a prick of a blade of grass
I've been layin' on way too long, got me itchy
Got up and roamed a lil' more
Miss Donda, you see my mama, tell her I'm lost
You see, she'd always light a cigarette, we'd talk, I would cough
Exaggeratin' a lil' bit, so she get the point
Tryna get her to stop smokin', I would leave and fire up a joint
'Til I quit, started back up again, twenty years later
All that time, y'all thought nigga was high, thought I was crazy
My mom, she ain't cut no corners
Got me back on track; I don't miss her overstepping
But do miss her showin' Seven civilian life shit
Ah, Miss Donda, you see my mama whisper her this:
The real reason I was geeked to go to church
Must confess, when y'all grown-ups would be in Bible study
That girl helping me with my homework? Her and I were fuckin'
So pure and perverted, so spirit spinning and dirty
So on, so on and so on, we hoped that no one heard us
Sh-sh, ah, ah
And to this day, I think her mama knew but let us explore
Miss Donda, you see my father, please, ask him:
Why he never married? Always smiled, but was he happy inside?
Because I carried my mother's name, did he carry shame with him?
I'm sure she did it out of spite; 'twas her decision at birth
Shit, she probably was hurt, ah, poor baby
Two young people with different views, a lot for a young lady
No coincidence, they both passed away from heart conditions
There's a dissidence at play; dad and mom do hard division
Three Thou', poster child for big dick niggas raised by their mothers
I'm supposed to smile as if God knew that I would be troubled
Keeps me around, for what? I don't know
But I do know that it's crucial that we do so, pronto
I don't know how much long though

[Verse 2: Kanye West, DMX & Diddy]
Mama, your son in the red hat
Had suffered set-backs, had, "shouldn't-have-said-thats"
Had made everyone mad
He made "808s" so he's everyone dad, know he ever gets sad
Hotel rooms by the shore, close my eyes, I can see more
Nobody punkin' me, nobody pressure me, nobody gangsta me
Especially when the gangstas eat thanks to me
And my favorite principal name was Mrs. Wooten
She was strict, the perfect instructor for young Putin
Vladimir, just so that is clear
Whom should we fear when we know Dad is here?
Daddy's right here, Daddy's right here
I don't play, boy
Over y'all dead body 'fore my daughter pose in Playboy
We don't condone over-sexualization of the kids in the home
Battery in my back
This house of pain won't ever last
CyHi told me to my face that "SICKO MODE" was his biggest song
Well go'n 'cause Donda was the best ghostwriter I ever had
South Park had jokes about fish sticks
'Til this day, the whole team can kiss this dick
I put Virgil and Drake on the same text
And it wasn't about the matching Arc'teryx or Kid Cudi dress
Just told these grown men, "Stop it with the funny shit"
I might hire the whole team from ACG
So don't text me like I'm Juanita JCV
Or more important, Monica Corgan, who was there for me
Somebody really there for me was rare for me
That was new air to breathe
When I was underappreciated, undervaluated
Stockholders told me, "Board rooms will bore you"
Can't remember going by your rules, try to follow the Lord's rules
Thought we was the new Abu Dhabi
Told Drake "Don't play with me on GD"
And he sent that message to everybody
So if I hit you with a "W-Y-D"
You better hit me with, "Yes sir, I'm writing everything you need"
I told you I was gonna take the summer back
So any of the cap, won't take none of that
Where my motherfuckin' red hat?
Security and the nannies be forever handling
I can't stand it when there's talks about puttin' the kids back in
Sierra Canyon when daddy got his own school
Trav, smile for these white people if you want (C'mon)
While we build a team to get Hoover out the joint
I do what I want, bro, in my life
Serve and protect long as it's my wife
Screaming on M-A-N's for trying to lower the percentage of SKIMS
See, I was going in
Back when they thought I was only making Ms, now it's nine-billi'
You ain't gotta like me, but you feel me

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Do y'all feel me? Really?
Get off Scott Free, I'm talking Ridley
Get off our knees, that's if you're with me
Get off your knees, that's if you're with me
Get off your knees and let's get free
Get off your knees and let's get free
Really, I mean really
Really, I mean really
I need release, I don't need police
I'm like, "nigga, please"
Y'all can't hear me, (Harmonizing), for the real me
For the real me, I mean, mhmm-mm

[Outro: DMX]
Alright, it's gonna shoot us in the- woah, uh-oh, uh-oh
Ready mama? (Yup)
I'm so proud of you, yup, you're gonna have so much fun
They gonna shoot us in the air, mama, okay?
C'mon, P, I got you, it's okay, mama
Hold your head back, hold your head back (Three, two, one)
Daddy's here, daddy's here, daddy's right here
It's okay, mama, daddy's here, daddy here
Help, help, daddy's right here, I'm scared
Okay, okay, I got you, it's okay
Okay, we goin' slow, we goin' slow down
It's okay, stop cryin', daddy got you, see, it's over, you did it, P!
You already did it! See? It's already over! Yay! You did it!
Big Girl! It's already over! It's already over, it's already over
Daddy right here, daddy right here
I told you I'm not gon' let you go
I'm not gon' let you go, mama, okay?
Daddy got you, daddy gon' bring us all the way down, okay?
How was it? (We good)
You did a good job (It was scary)
Good job!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Saw the future of the bounce
You can see wherever it soun-
I could do it where it counts
I got nothin' for the low
I been sonning for allowance
I been done up for the now
And that name I can't pronounce
I was always on the town
Tell me how you like it's sounds

[Refrain 1: Kanye West]
Do you like the way it sounds?
Do you like the way it sounds?
That's the future of the bounce
Do you like the way it sounds? (Ha, ha)
Do you like the way it sounds? (Ha, ha)
Tell me now, do you like the way it sounds?

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
I can see the future is lookin' like we level through the sky
I can't wait to live in glory and eternal lastin' life
Won't you take the wheel? I'll recline and I'll sit still
Might as well turn up now, he gon' pop up unannounced
To the trumpets, do you like the way it sounds?

[Refrain 2: Kanye West & Travis Scott]
I cannot take another ounce (Ah)
Runnin' for the crowd
I can't hear my thoughts, so loud
I can hear their doubts so loud
Do you like the way it sounds?
Feel like I've been gone for a while
But there ain't no turnin' back now
Miracles wash away the doubts
Then the drum line drops, do you like the way it sounds?

[Outro: Victory Elyse Boyd]
Do you like the way, like the way it sounds?
Do you like the way, like the way it sounds?
Do you like the way, like the way it sounds?
Do you like the way, like the way it sounds?
Do you like the way, like the way it sounds?
Do you like the way, like the way it sounds?
Do you like the way, like the way it sounds?
Do you like the way, like the way it sounds?
Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
That lil' bitch like Jada, uh, she entangled
She swear that she love me, now, 'cause I'm paid up
That lil' bitch is dangerous, uh, I can't save her
Shawty stoopin' so low, so I gotta stay up, and stay out
Every bitch that I'm with give me the same love
Every time that I reply it's with the same line
Same line, baby I'm a dog I cannot make time
Thought she love you, but keep callin' tryna waste my...
Sitting here just thinking about nothing
Trying to gather my thoughts
Over and over I'm thinking about all we have lost

All about you, you
It’s all about you, you
All about you, you
It’s not about me, yeah
It’s all about you

It's not about what I've done
It’s all about what you did
All about what did to me
You did for me
You gave me life and life abundantly,
Took all my struggles for more than me
That's what you did
I'm amazed by you

It's not about my past, It's not my future
It's about the present, It's right now

[Verse 1]
It hurt some
I heard you say you couldn't be "the O.N.E"
It hurt some
When you said you do believe anyone else but "just not me"
WTF dude?
Why's it gotta be you? (Hey)
Said you were waiting on me
All along you were hating on me

[Pre-Chorus]
Said you'd support me
If I got better
And I told you I could see the finish line
Said you were for me, well I got my shit together
If you mean it this time

[Chorus x2]
Well I think I'm feeling better now (Hey)
Especially since I can hear me on the radio (Hey)
And you can turn on your TV and see the video (Hey)
And tell your friends that we did it for the city yo (Hey)

[Verse 2]
It's not been too long, they've always seen things colder
And they'll be your chauffeur
It's so foul
It's gone so long, I've always been your soldier
But you've been a poser
Man how?
WTF dude?
Why's it gotta be you? (Hey)
Said you were waiting on me
All along you were hating on me

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(What the what the) what the heck?
(What the what the) what the heck?
(What the what the) what the heck?
(What the what the) what the heck?
(What the what the) what the heck?
(What the what the) what the heck?
(What the what the) what the heck?
(What the what the) what the heck?

[Verse 3]
He had every right
I see it clearer
Who's jealous of me?
He's in the mirror
When I started, you would not hold me down
But now I'm taking off, you wanna hold me now?
If the people were yawning, and I was just calling
We had stuff in common, you love it now
Well I guess (?)

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 1]
When the world is on your shoulder
Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down
If you can't hang with the feelin'
Then there ain't no room for you this part of town

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy that's the only way

[Chorus]
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all (Live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall (Live it off the wall)

[Verse 2]
You can shout out all you want to
'Cause there ain't no sin in folks all getting loud
If you take the chance and do it
Then there ain't no one who's gonna put you down

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy that's the only way

[Chorus]
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
C'mon and groove, and let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all (Live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall (Live it off the wall)

[Bridge]
Do what you want to do
There ain't no rules it's up to you
(Ain't no rules, it's all up to you)
It's time to come alive
And party on right through the night (All right)

[Verse 3]
Gotta hide your inhibitions
Gotta let that fool loose deep inside your soul
Want to see an exhibition, hee
Better do it now before you get too old

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy that's the only way

[Chorus]
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
C'mon and groove, yeah, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all (Live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
C'mon and groove, yeah, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf, yeah
And just enjoy yourself
C'mon and groove, yeah, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall

And don't you bother talkin' to me
I got everything that I need
Yeah, let me move, gimme room, let me breathe

[Verse]
Yeah, I tried to leave it alone
But the feelin' too deep in my bones
Out the window, I was seein' the road
Nobody home though, each to their own
Yeah, and you can give it a try
Come fuck with me, get high
Yeah, I keep a bitch on my side
But she'll never be as pretty as I
La-la-la
Where did my days go?
Spend a lot of time with my bankroll
I know you got your eye on that halo
You just wanna fly
And don't you dare tell me you sorry
You just'd be wastin' my time
I don't got much more to give
I mind my business, let me live

Yeah, let me move, gimme room, let me breathe
And don't you bother talkin' to me

[Verse 1]
Only a matter of time
Before we lose our mind
Only a matter of days left
Only a couple of ways down

[Chorus]
You know it don't feel so small
When you’re holding, I seem to call
Just reaching for her hand

[Verse 2]
Only a matter of aches
Before the body breaks
Only a matter of timing
Only a matter of ways down, goin'

[Chorus]
You know it don't feel so small
When you’re holding, I seem to call
Just reaching for her hand

[Verse 3]
Her psyche must be wild
'Cause just today I smiled
And I saw the number of letters
From the debt collectors that I left
You know it don't feel so small
Don't they know I owe nothing at all
Just reaching for her hand

[Verse 4]
The mermaids gather around
In the blood of New York Island
It's only a matter of time now, before
Before this land and your land, before
Before this land is my land, before
Before this land is her land, you know
That she's gonna gather a song
Give me guilt with nowhere to call
Just reaching for her hand

[Verse 1]
Try and get some rest
I'll do the rest
Think to what the roses find
With the arms of passion
This is how we fashion
Wars remind
In the hour I loved you
Like a dream it was true
In the base of my pine

[Chorus]
Wilderness
Vast abyss
Will we ever kiss?

[Verse 2]
In her mother's fortress
She was brushing horses
Manes and tails, flicking flies
Naked as the window
Baby, if it's real so
No need to apologize

[Chorus]
Wilderness
Vast abyss
Will we ever kiss?

[Outro]
Blood is on her shoulder
Love is on the boulder
In the eyes, in the eyes
Love never leaves
Love is the leaves
In the sky, in the sky

[Verse 1]
Blue and red horses on the run
I think the angel is jumping the gun
Little red lantern watching the sun
Maybe the angel is jumping the gun

[Chorus]
I'm a lot of boy with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?
I'm a lot of boy with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?

[Verse 2]
Little red flower on your wrist
Maybe the angel fired and missed
Little red flowers on your wrist
I think the angel fired and missed

[Chorus]
I'm a lot of boy with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?
I'm a lot of boy with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?

[Verse 3]
Little red forest in your room
I hope the angel is getting here soon
Little red forest in your room
I hope the angel is getting here soon

[Chorus]
I'm a lot of boy with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?
I'm a lot of boy with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?

[Outro]
Little red flower, blue and red horses
Little red flower, blue and red horses
Little red forest, little red horses
Little red flower, little red horses
Little red forest
Little red forest
Little red forest
Little red forest
With a lot of nerve

[Verse 1]
Pretty grey zombie
Feeding upon me
Please turn around
Show me your weary green eyes

[Verse 2]
Her heart is mangled
She's got me in a fable
Please follow through, please
Stay with me awhile

[Chorus]
Morning comes to divide the dreamer from the dream
To live young, to survive the one you can’t outrun
To live young

[Verse 3]
Him galloping 

[?]
I stumble and trot
I'm gonna learn whether you teach me or not

[Verse 4]
I'm going past her
I forgot to guard
Warm light
Fall tooth, learning to fall

[Chorus]
Ending comes to divide the dreamer from the dream
To live young, to survive the one you can’t outrun
To live young

[Outro]
Morning comes to divide the dreamer from the dream
I make a motherfucker say
Oh yeah
I'm cold as a lion with no hair
If you ever see me fightin in da forest
With a grizzly bear
HELP DA BEAR
Cause that bitch goin need it
And I'm home and greedy
Gimmie that got damn porridge
But I ain't een goin eat it
I fell out with fall (why)
Fuckin spring
I got into it with summer
Cause I told her that the winter be comin
I had a fight with lightning
Yeah I kicked his ass
I sent him home on a lightning bolt
I ducked the flash but I got a tan
We come together like
The birds and the bees
And the trees and the leaves
And the pots and the pans
But we always fight like cats and dogs
And roaches and raid cans
I say what's happenin my man
Know I'm sayin
What's happening my man
?? up
Power up
Motherfucker
Get it up there then
Get it up there then
Motherfucker
Get it up there then
?? up
Power up
Motherfucker
Get it up there then

[Verse 1]
Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

[Chorus]
'Cause everywhere we lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Haiti, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything we need and more
It's written all over your face
Haiti, we can feel your halo
I pray it won't fade away

[Post-Chorus]
Halo
I can see your halo
I can see your halo
I can see your halo

[Verse 2]
You hit me like a ray of sun
Burnin' through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

[Chorus]
Everywhere we lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Haiti, we can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything we need and more
It's written all over your face
Haiti, we can see your halo
I pray it won't fade away

[Post-Chorus]
Your halo
I can see your halo
I can see your halo

[Chorus]
Everywhere we lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Haiti, we can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything we need and more
It's written all over your face
Haiti, we can feel your halo
I pray it won't fade away

[Verse 1]
They told him, "Don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it (Woo!)
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man (Woo!)
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

[Chorus]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (Beat it)

Just beat it (Beat it, uh)

[Verse 2]
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it (Woo!)
You have to show them that you're really not scared (Woo!)
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare (Woo!)
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

[Chorus]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated

Black or White

[Intro]
Aaow!

[Verse]
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
And I told 'em about equality
And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right
Hoo!

[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Hoo!

Can’t Let Her Get Away

[Verse]
I try so hard to love you
Some things take time and shame
I think the whole world of you
Your thoughts of me remain
I'll play the fool for you
I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do
Just make this dream come true (make a dream come true)
If I let her get away
Though I'm begging on my knees
I'll be crying everyday
Knowing the girl that got away

[Hook]
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let

Dangerous

[Spoken Intro]
The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse]
I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
"Come go with me", I said, "I have no time" (Hee-hee!)
She said "Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone" (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee! Hee!)

[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)

Who Is It

[Verse]
I gave her money
I gave her time
I gave her everything
Inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises
And secrets so untold

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
And a day we’d live as one
We made our vows
We’d live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It’s a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

(Who is it?)

Remember the Time

[Verse]
Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you remember, back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?

Give In to Me

[Verse]
She always takes it with a heart of stone
'Cause all she does is throw it back to me
I've spent a lifetime looking for someone
Don't try to understand me
Just simply do the things I say

[Chorus]
Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me, woman
Give in to me, give in to me

Heal the World

[Chorus]
Heal the world (Heal the world)
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Post-Chorus]
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Outro: Michael Jackson & Child]
Make a better place (You and for me)
Make a better place (You and for me)
Make a better place (You and for me)
(You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children (You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children (You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children (You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children

[Verse 1]
There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know that that's the truth
Because now it's onto me

[Refrain]
I don't understand it, hey
I don't understand it
OW

[Verse 2]
There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul has fallen

[Chorus]
Don't understand it
Got a ghost, got 'em breakin' the walls
Got ghouls, got 'em breakin' the halls, gotta see, won't ya
Don't understand it
Got ghosts, got 'em breakin' the walls
Got ghouls, got 'em breakin' the halls, gotta see, won't ya
Got ghosts, got 'em breakin' the walls
Got ghouls, got 'em breakin' the halls, gotta see, won't ya

[Bridge]
And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to share my baby? She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?
The ghost of jealousy

[Verse 3]
There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul has fallen

[Chorus]
Don't understand it
Got ghosts, got 'em breakin' the walls
Got ghouls, got 'em breakin' the halls, gotta see, won't ya
Don't understand it
Got ghosts, got 'em breakin' the walls
Got ghouls, got 'em breakin' the halls, gotta see, won't ya
You're just a doggone
Got ghosts, got 'em breakin' the walls
Got ghouls, got 'em breakin' the halls, gotta see, won't ya
Got ghosts, got 'em breakin' the walls
Got ghouls, got 'em breakin' the halls, gotta see

[Bridge]
And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to share my baby? She needs me
Who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion to see me?
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?
A suckin' ghost of jealousy
OW

[Outro]
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to share my baby? She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree? (Oh no no)
And who gave you the right to take intrusion to see me?
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to share my baby? She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?

Starquake

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Ayy, I came straight up out the streets (streets)
Big Draco in my lap (lap)
I'on think no nigga want smoke with me (smoke with me), ayy
Backwood, 3.5, it's on me (on me)
VVS my chain, how you ain't notice me? (Notice me?)
Riding through the city, double cup of lean (cup of lean)
Make the wrong move, we gon' shoot before you blink (blink)
I just put my Rolex in the sink (in the sink)
Ridin' in a Phantom sippin' east of E'

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Ayy, I copped that Lambo' truck
Ayy, bad bitches all on me when I'm pullin' up
Ayy, I just put them bricks on a tour bus
Ayy, I just made a movie in New York
Ayy, skrt, skrt, skrt, hit the pot with the fork
Ayy, I smell like a pound when I walked inside court
Ayy, I just dropped the top of Lambi', got the Porsche
Ayy, I got this bad bitch, her pussy moist
Ayy, she just blanked out, oh shit, brr, that's what I'm rollin'
She just off the molly, I'm just off the Perky
I be off the lean, it be have a nigga swervin'
If you make the wrong move, I shoot like Kyrie Irving
Catch me in the coupe going fast and I'm swervin'
Sippin' on this lean with the chopper got me nervous
Whole lotta cash, I can't count it up, it hurtin'
Thumbin' through them bands in Atlanta, getting swervin'

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
I came straight up out the streets (streets)
Big Draco in my lap (lap)
I'on think no nigga want smoke with me (smoke with me), ayy
Backwood, 3.5, it's on me (on me)
VVS my chain, how you ain't notice me? (Notice me?)
Riding through the city, double cup of lean (cup of lean)
Make the wrong move, we gon' shoot before you blink (blink)
I just put my Rolex in the sink (in the sink)
Ridin' in a Phantom sippin'...

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Lambo' sitting in the driveway, I got bricks on the highway
Big Backwood like Friday, we get high like everyday
Trap been out of sting raid, murders on the expressway
SOD, that's gang lang', richer than my Bentley
Shoot clip 'til it's empty, red bricks look like Blimpie
Takeout just like Twin Peaks, bustdown Roll', it's nosebleed
VVS, it's OD, chain look like a jetski
Dollar mint like Master P, big Draco stay on me

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Ayy, I came straight up out the streets (streets)
Big Draco in my lap (lap)
I'on think no nigga want smoke with me (smoke with me), ayy
Backwood, 3.5, it's on me (on me)
VVS my chain, how you ain't notice me? (Notice me?)
Riding through the city, double cup of lean (cup of lean)
Make the wrong move, we gon' shoot before you blink (blink)
I just put my Rolex in the sink (in the sink)
Ridin' in a Phantom sippin' east of E'

[Verse 1]
As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do, so I stopped, and got out
And looked down, I noticed I've got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car, like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling like a mist
So I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said, "Don't you worry, my friend, I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there"
Oh

[Chorus]
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name (Yeah, oh)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

[Verse 2]
As she took me right through the fog
I seen beautiful city appear
Of where kids are playing and people are laughing
And smiling and nothing to fear
She said, "This is the place where no people have pain, with love and happiness
She turned around, looked down at my eyes, and they started crying
And grabbed my hand, you've got a friend"
Oh

[Chorus]
Take me to a place without no name (No name)
Take me to a place without no name (A place without, a place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name (Take me, take me, place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name (Oh, yeah, doggone, oh)

[Bridge]
She started liking me, kissing me, and hugging me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen, and things I've never done
This really looks like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass, and the skies and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world could I wanna leave? Oh

[Chorus]
Take me to a place without no name (Doggone, take me, no name)
Take me to a place without no name (A place without, no, no, no)

[Outro]
La la la lalala lalala la la (Na, na, a place without no name)
La la la lalala lalala la la (A place without no name)

[Verse 1]
She dances in his sheets at night
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

[Chorus]
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm, to the rhythm
Rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm

[Bridge]
She works so hard just to make her way
For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Yet she could not stop, couldn't break his chains
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

[Chorus]
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
Love, love, love, love

[Verse 1]
You could make a grown man cry
If you ever said "Goodbye"
Never let you go, oh, I (Never let you go, oh, I)
You could make a grown man cry
If you ever left my side
Never let you go, oh, I (Never let you go, oh, I)

[Verse 2]
You're the only hand in my back pocket
If you ever left, I'd go psychotic
Heaven, hear me cryin', cryin' (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Baby, you're the key to my heart, lock it
If you ever left, never unlock it
Lonely like an island, island (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
If my love ain't your love
It's never gonna be nobody's love
I'm never gonna need nobody's love but yours (But yours)
If my love ain't your love
It's never gonna be nobody's love
Never gonna need nobody's touch but yours (But yours)

[Verse 1]
You could make a grown man cry
If you ever said "Goodbye"
Never let you go, oh, I (Never let you go, oh, I)
You could make a grown man cry
If you ever left my side
Never let you go, oh, I (Never let you go, oh, I)

[Verse 3]
You're the only hand in my back pocket
If you ever left, I'd go psychotic
Heaven hear me cryin', cryin' (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Hit me like a drug and I can't stop it
Fit me like a glove and I can't knock it
I ain't even lyin', lyin' (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
If my love ain't your love
It's never gonna be nobody's love
I'm never gonna need nobody's love but yours (Nobody's but yours)
If my love ain't your love
It's never gonna be nobody's love
Never gonna need nobody's touch but yours (But yours)

[Bridge]
If my love ain't your love, then it's nobody's
Only yours, only yours, not just anybody
And if you ever leave, then I'm never gon' want
Nobody, nobody love
If my love ain't your love, then it's nobody's
Only yours, only yours, not just anybody's
And if you ever leave, then I'm never gon' want
Nobody, nobody love
Nobody's love
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
If my love ain't your love
It's never gonna be nobody's love
I'm never gonna need nobody's love but yours (No, no, but yours)
If my love ain't your love
It's never gonna be nobody's love
Never gonna need nobody's touch but yours (No, no, no, no, but yours)

[Outro]
If my love ain't your love, then it's nobody's
Only yours, only yours, not just anybody
And if you ever leave, then I'm never gon' want
Nobody, nobody love
If my love ain't your love, then it's nobody's
Only yours, only yours, not just anybody's
And if you ever leave, then I'm never gon' want
Nobody, nobody love

[Verse 1]
Come in to me
I'm your mystical garden
Orchards and violets
All mysteries are parted
Life is a mirageghost
Imagination
Pure inspiration for justification

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing's impossible
Nothing's concealed
Everything here is for real
What is fantastical all in your head?
Who creates these wonders like nobody can?

[Bridge]
When it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind over magic in true
Your own thoughts play the game
In the magical wonders they do
The mind in the magic is you

[Verse 2]
Move of the head
And I'll change your emotions
Strange things appear
From euphorics, devotions
Everything's happening
Nothing's unreal
Hallucinating the mind in the real

[Pre-Chorus]
Seeing black panthers
That suddenly fly
White tigers stalking your mind
Hallucinating the things that you see
This kind of magic's so hard to believe

[Chorus]
Siegfried & Roy
You know it's

It's the mind of a magic in true
Your own thoughts play the game
In the magical wonders they do
The mind in the magic is you

When it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
When it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
(Seeing is believin')
When it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
Hallucinations
The game of this kind
This kind of magic
Throw over mind

[Spoken Intro]
Think about, um, the generations
And they say we wanna make it a better place for our children
And our children's children
So that they they they know it's a better world for them
And think they can make it a better place

[Verse 1]
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

[Pre-Chorus]
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

[Verse 2]
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares for joyful giving
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear or dread
We stop existing and start living

[Pre-Chorus]
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better world

[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

[Bridge]
And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be God's glow

[Verse 3]
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

[Pre-Chorus]
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

[Outro]
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

[Verse 1]
Come in to me
I'm your mystical garden
Orchards and violets
All mysteries are parted
Life is a mirageghost
Imagination
Pure inspiration for justification

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing’s impossible
Nothing's concealed
Everything here is for real
What is fantastical all in your head?
Who creates these wonders like nobody can?

When it’s Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind over magic in true
Your own thoughts play the game
In the magical wonders they do
The mind in the magic is you

[Verse 2]
Move of the head
And I'll change your emotions
Strange things appear
From euphorics, devotions
Everything's happening
Nothing's unreal
Hallucinating the mind in the real

[Pre-Chorus]
Seeing black panthers
That suddenly fly
White tigers stalking your mind
Hallucinating the things that you see
This kind of magic's so hard to believe

[Chorus]
Siegfried & Roy
You know it's
Siegfried & Roy
So be it
Siegfried & Roy
Doggone it

It's the mind of a magic in true
Hallucinations
The game of this kind
This kind of magic
Throw over mind

I need to check myself into a rehab, but no (Ladies and gentlemen)
And I don't trust these bitches

Yeah, said I'm a motherfuckin' pioneer
He is I and I am here
Everythin' become a blur, feel like I've been high for years
Homie, I'll be hidin' here, the moon is out, the sky is clear
'Bout to run the streets, tell the feds to get the riot gear (Whoa)
Comin' to destroy it all, burn it to the ground
With a middle finger up and my hand on my nut sack (Whoa)
A light skin bitch to hide my drugs in her butt crack (Gimme that back)
We gettin' money, tell me, "Slow down," sayin', "Fuck that" (Fuck that)
Soarin' in the '81 DeLorean, we ridin' out
All these bitches tryna audition, I be like Simon Cowell (Yeah, you're horrible)
Never wind it down, for a better time is now
Swear I be killin' myself, I feel like Private Pyle (Ch-che, blaow)
Keep my rice in Chinatown, guess I'm goin' Hollywood
Pittsburgh blood in my veins, in there I'm always good (Always)

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
Most Dope soldier, thought I told you it's forever (Uh-huh)
You don't need a picture, just remember

[Chorus: Future & Mac Miller]

I need to check myself into a rehab, but no
And I don't trust these bitches

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Again, okay, okay
Two days with no sleep, my eyes wide shut (Shut)
Yeah, I started in the nosebleeds, now the homies got floor seats (Whoa)
I'm still rockin' Only, I gave Clock the Rollie with the blue face (Okay, okay)
Threw away my Louis V suitcase, it's everything Ralph, no BB gun (Voilà)
A bitch to hold it down all the time, yeah, I keep me one
Mac Foley to the Mankind (Yeah), game on landmine (Yeah)
Trouble on my damn mind (Yeah)
Hit me on the landline (Bing, woo)
I'm Ric Flair before the thin hair (Woo)
Read Bukowski naked in a lambskin chair, stuntin'
Somethin' for your bitch ass
So tell me why your girl look exactly like Sinbad, damn (Bad, bad)
They probably wanna put me in rehab (Meh)
Rather be somewhere off the coast fishin' sea bass (Reel 'em in)

[Refrain: Mac Miller & Future]
Most Dope soldier, thought I told you it's forever (Woo)
You don't need a picture, just remember (Let's go, woo)

Well, you know, gospel, Pac-Man's the same way, you roll ’round the hood and you eat up all the ghosts.

[2-D]
Oh, right.

From the past.

[Murdoc]
Is that what he was doing, really, essentially?

[Russel]
That's right, yeah.

He teleported me a note. (Yeah) That said to you, that said, uh, "Know thy self," (Yeah) "and be they self," (Yeah) "by yourself," (On your own? That's so very—) "on shelf."

He-he know stranger danger. When he see, and he know the pasty can be nasty, he—

[Verse]
Stick with no kickback, it came with a silencer
I’m on a jet, takin’ trips with an islander
Your crew a whole bunch of squares like a calendar
I chop a tree till it’s down to the wood
I’m at the Hawks game, feet on the wood
Try to rob me? Boy, I wish that you would
Better come back like the milk in the left eye
Bandanna wrapped round’ my head like I’m left eye
Runnin’ from cops, had to make me a left turn
If she keep think’ she my bitch, she gon’ get left
I pulled the flight, I blow the whistle like pro ref
Uh, huh, huh, ah, huh, huh, huh
I don’t need friends, I’m Gucci’
Walk in the crib, pop the stick in my Poochie
Kick out the hoes that pretend to be boujee
She wanna fuck on my side like Toosi
Fuck up her mouth, then but all on her boobies
Niggas be gangsta online, they think this shit a movie
Call up my slime ball, I ain’t talkin’ Nudy
He tote a draco, that shit heavy duty
Smash up a niggas insides like a smoothie
Remember them days I would ride in a hoopty
Used to do loops, until I was wooly
Now I’m too up, you cannot approach me
Niggas too broke, they cannot consult me
She off the dopeity, thinkin’ I’m finna give her back
She ain’t even stroke me
Strokin’, strokin’, strokin’, strokin’, strokin’, strokin’ (Ha)
Yeah, put all them bitches inside of a jet
Off to Jamaica, they tryna’ get wet
You can get wacked, tryna’ reach for my racks
It’s ride or die, my Muslim bitch had to give me a break
Poppin’ percs, got me fuckin’ like I’m thirty eight
Listen to this sermon, got me tryna’ clean a dirty plate
Had to put codeine down, I did it for my mommas sake

[Outro]
Shew, shew, yeah, unh
Ah, ohhhh, da da dad da nooo

Boy you phony you can't vibe, whats that safe code?

Why these pussy niggas so fake though?
Kill a pussy nigga then lay low
We don't come outside till the case closed
My bitch be snorting lines till her face froze
It's snowing all year round I'm talking yayo
I'm sitting on this bread like some mayo
Like some butter on a motherfucking bagel
Like tomatoes, a egg yolk
I walk it like I talk it with a sore throat and my legs broke
I go hard like I'm dead broke
I'm fed up and my head hurt
This choppa in my pants leg got me limping harder than Fred Durst
You ain't doing shit, I've said worse
Dirty south, that red dirt
I ain't doing shit without getting bread first
And you ain't leaving until I wear it first
I put the choppa in your mouth watch your head burst
Ooh lil mama with the hand work
And she suck a nigga dick until my leg jerk
Then she swallow all that shit, then burp
Then she swallow all that shit, then burp
She ask me to fuck her friend first
I said "why not?", I said "yeah sure"
Because her boyfriend be getting on her last nerve
Pussy ass nigga need a pap smear
Squad got more swag than a black shirt
Cook it up, chop it up, racks served
Cook it up, chop it up, racks served
Cake mode
Cake mode
Only come outside just to make more
Same clothes, anything goes
When I'm in cake mode
Take more
Lord I'm in chase mode
Same clothes
Watching for them police in them plain clothes

We got that base, that blow
You fuck with basic hoes
Oh say it ain't so

My niggas killing that white girl, O.J. and Nicole
Rosé on the go
Lil Jose cut you up
Put your body parts in the freezer we got supper for months
AAHH!

Stay froze
Stay froze
Life is like a wheel that won't slow down (no)
One thing you can lay your money on (what goes around comes around)
Oh, when I say I'm the one, oh now (baby, baby I can't do nothing wrong)
Didn't last too long

But when thinking that you're always there
If I've got to start all over
Baby, I don't care

In my message to the world
Well, I know what I would say
Baby, I made a few mistakes
I almost let her get away

In my message to the world
Ain't no way that we can fall
It's gonna be better than it ever was
Cause baby we survived it all

Someone's always following close behind (woah)
When you think it comes so easy where (they move you high, you had your time)
Woo! (Baby, baby I understand, understand how the game is played)
I thought I had it made
If it hadn't been for all your love
I don't know if I'd have found
A way to rise above

In my message to the world
Well, I know what I would say
Baby, I made a few mistakes
I almost let her get away

In my message to the world
Ain't no way that we can fall
It's gonna be better than it ever was
Cause baby we survived it all

If it hadn't been for all your love
I don't know if I'd have found
A way to rise above

In my message to the world
Well, I know what I would say
Baby, I made a few mistakes
I almost let her get away

In my message to the world
Ain't no way that we can fall
It's gonna be better than it ever was
Cause baby we survived it all
I can't seem to fill my time at all
I can't find good conversation
I try to pretend we never met
But that ain't no consolation
I'm lost, hoo yeah

I heard that I'm doing very well
And I don't need anybody
Well, I wish that was the truth of it, yeah
'Cause I ain't got you beside me

Where do we draw the line
Baby, there's some things that just... I just don't know
And I ain't giving up on another chance to...

Put us together again
If it's not too late
It's not the end
It could take time
But I could show you every reason why we should
Put us together again
Thing's are gonna be better again
Just one more try
To make it worth the love that we want it to be
I heard that you were leaving town today
I heard that you were getting married, oh no
Well, I hope it's just another rumor
'Cause my heart's getting hard to carry

Baby it's no surprise
I can't help it (putting us back together babe)
Thinking I just can't get myself over you
It's been a while
And I've been holding out on another chance to

Put us together again
If it's not too late
It's not the end
It could take time
But I could show you every reason why we should
Put us together again
Thing's are gonna be better again
Just one more try
To make it worth the love that we want it to be

{scatting}

Put us together again
If it's not too late
It's not the end
It could take time
But I could show you every reason why we should
Put us together again
Thing's are gonna be better again
Just one more try
To make it worth the love that we want it to be
I'm all alone when the music starts
The lights go down, it's so cold
I'm afraid to turn around
'Cause there's nobody waiting
But, ooh there's got to be a place for me

'Cause it's a big world out there
Somebody must care

Someone to love to come to my rescue
Someone will come for me
Can't stop believing I'll get through
Somebody's gonna come
Just wait and see

I can't go on, but I can't stay here
There's nowhere to run anymore
Sometimes a loved one disappears
Sometimes a love will find you
But mine will be here any day now
If I just hold on
Hold on
I'm waiting so long

Someone to love to come to my rescue
Someone will come for me
Can't stop believing I'll get through
Somebody's gonna come
Just wait and see

It's a foolish heart
Pretending to be strong
Now it's getting harder and harder

Just to hold on
Hold on
I'm waiting so long

Someone to love to come to my rescue
Someone will come for me
I can't stop believing I'll get through
Somebody's gonna come
Just wait and see

Someone to love to come to my rescue
Someone will come for me
Can't stop believing I'll get through
I'm gonna sit right now, take my time, and rest for a while
Someone to love to come to my rescue
Someone will come for me
Can't stop believing I'll get through
Made up my mind, somebody, somebody gonna come

Someone to love to come to my rescue
Someone will come for me
Can't stop believing I'll get through
Somebody gonna come, I just gotta believe in...

More and more and more and more and more
You don't know what it do to me
I'm trying to tell you, mmm hmm

I never thought that a man like me
Could fall in love so easily
I used to believe "easy come, easy go"
But then one day you came along
And made me weak where I used to be strong
I gave into love because of you

Baby, you're the one
You're the one
You know you are the one
The one that I love

Please keep this thought in your mind
This love affair, it's yours and it's mine
Together forever, whatever we do
I've had my share of tears and laughter
Tender moments are all that I'm after
For the rest of my life there is someone who needs me
Baby, you're the one
You're the one
And you'll always be the one
The one that I love
Oh yeah baby, you're the one
You're the one
I know you are the one
The one that I love

Oh, I'm trying to tell you

[harmonica solo]
Temptations, sing!

[scatting]

Baby, you're the one
You're the one
In my heart it's you that I want
Everything comes in different sizes
Small, medium, large, if you're buying
There's always something new to be tried on
All you have to do is decide, Lord help me

I like my love to be perfected
You know we measure just right darling
We can't quit, no baby
There's no doubt about the way I feel
You couldn't find or make a better deal baby

Love me right
Love me right
Start tonight
I want you to love me
I want a love
Love
Sweet
Love me in the night so deep

I believe in a tailor-made love
Using the finest fabrics to wrap us up (wrap up)
Gotta have that lasting quality
Studded with ever-loving TLC
A girl like you comes once in a lifetime
I closed the door on love but you changed my mind, baby
Don't you think that there's any more conversation
Come on sweet darling, let's make the right alteration

Love me right
Love me right
Start tonight
I want you to love me
I want a love
Love
Sweet
Love me in the night so deep

A girl like you comes once in a lifetime
I closed the door on love but, girl you changed my mind, baby
Don't you think that there's any more conversation
Come on sweet darling, let's make the right alteration

EDITING IN PROGRESS

[Audience]
Yeah Kanye!

[Audience]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy…

[Kanye]
I figured if we were all quiet, I wouldn’t need a mic in here is that true?

[Audience]
Yeah.

[Kanye]
What is the number one thing that you guys want to change, because I want you all to 

[inaudible]?

[Audience]
(Crosstalk) Education.

[Kanye]
All right, get up here. 

[inaudible]. I want you to explain what the problem with education is.

[Summer]
The problem with education is they don’t stick up for minorities or people who aren’t in 

[inaudible]…

[Kanye]
Hold on one second. What I want you guys to do no one to clap, no one to scream until she says I am done with my point.

[Audience]
Yes sir.

[Kanye]

[inaudible] then explain the issue.

[Summer]
My name is Summer 

[?]. I’d like to say that the issue with education is that it is whitewashed and not only white-washed, it is washed over by whoever is the victor. So that people who are marginalized in any community, not just necessarily people of color…

[Kanye]
I know that we are trained to emotionally react to the points that are said, to say "Mm-hmm I feel that" or "Mm-hmm, I feel that". But today, I want you guys to try, not to try, because trying is failing. What I want you guys to do is show how we can have complete silence until she expresses her point completely. And when she is done and says, "I...I...We have fully expressed ourselves" because I don’t love the word, I. Which I get the 

[inaudible].

When she says, We have completely expressed our point…

[interrupted] who is that?

(

[We can’t hear you in the back])

You can’t hear? Can we close those two Malcolm X doors in the back?

You see where the two exits are? Is it okay to close the doors, but keep them unlocked, while we’re talking? I think it can help with the sound. Moving forward, we will be in rooms where the acoustics will be absolutely incredible because I will be involved in the design.

[Kanye]
Summer…Summer has an expression about education. Summer go ahead, now what I’m saying is no camera flicks, no flashes, no moving, no opening up Doritos bags. All right Summer, let’s go.

[Summer]
Okay, so the problem with education that I was saying is, people are marginalized, they’re not teaching all of history. They’re only teaching it from one perspective, which is the victor's perspective. That’s not always the right perspective and I feel like if we’re able to include other people into the perspective and into the conversation, it’ll teach the generation coming up how to be more inclusive, how to respond to situations. It’ll teach people how to love each other.

There’s just so much wrong with education, some people don’t know so many things, not only just in high school, in college, in the jail systems, everywhere. So many people don’t know, after you come out of jail, you still have the right to vote. A lot of people don’t know that. There’s so much wrong with the education that we can’t keep up with…

[Kanye]

[inaudible], history.

Summer’s going to speak on police brutality also. She has another expression she needs to make.

[Summer]
Is that okay with you guys?

[Audience]
Yes!

[Kanye]
Wait a second. It doesn’t have to be okay with you guys because I stated that she was going to do that…

Quiet down for a second because the problem is, we only have made moves that we are generally okay with not understanding that Instagram has been controlling the opinions of what we are okay with.

[Audience]
Yes!

[Kanye West]
So, me as the leader of the free world, it's time for the very first round.

[Audience]
Yes!

[Kanye]
Inside of the very first rally. 

[crosstalk] I’ve made a decision that Summer is going to express her feelings and information on police brutality. Silence please.

[Summer]
Okay, so my feelings on police brutality is not everyone should be allowed onto the police force, first of all. So many people are on the police force that shouldn’t be in the police force. They just want to have authority in action and power. Not only that, what he was saying about brainwashing, obviously he’s right. He’s Kanye West.

[inaudible] social media is brainwashing people, stuff like TikTok. TikTok is brainwashing little kids. People are on here at 3 years old watching TikTok.

[Kanye]
Pause, pause. If you guys want to whisper, go outside and talk. We need absolute silence, we need absolute order. That is the only way for this country to be back in order. And for us to have absolute order, respect, dignity, and honor for those that we showed up in here and that are speaking. Summer is talking right now, if you see someone next to you that nudges you or tries to whisper. Hold your hand and say, this person is distracting me from what Summer is saying right now, and we will have them escorted out.

Now Summer, go ahead.

[Summer]
So on the topic of brainwashing, just everything brainwashes us now. Social media, if they want something, they can program it into our minds. TV, social media, literally everything and the state of the nation is just it’s in complete dismay.

Summer: (06:04)
There’s one cop that feels like everything is okay, there’s one out that feels like everything is in tatters. And I wish everyone can just come together, respect everyone’s opinions. You don’t have to agree with them, but you can always respect their opinion and that’s how I feel. I have expressed what I needed to say.

Kanye West: (06:04)
Raise your hand silently if you have another issue that you would like to bring up. I saw your hand first.

Lauren: (06:04)
My name is Lauren McLeod.

Kanye West: (06:04)
This is Lauren McLeod.

Kanye West: (08:43)
I understand everyone is excited, it’s a new world. You have someone who is not afraid of anyone and only afraid of God and in honor to God…we have someone who isn’t afraid of anyone and in honor to God and is at a 132 I.Q. genius that literally went to the hospital because his brain was too big for his skull and literally…Absolutely no clapping. That went to Adidas when it was 50 billion dollar organization losing two billion dollars and ended up at 62 billion dollars before COVID that went to the stock market with GAP and whose net worth went from 3.3 billion to 5 billion in 45 minutes. Now, that his friends, I only have one superhero friend right now, who is that? 

[inaudible 00:08:49]. Okay, so we have one member of the superhero avenger team, so far. So I know that this is an exciting movement, but we’re not excited because if I told you that I bought you a brand new Mercedes Benz and it’s outside, you’d run to the car. But if I was society today, I wouldn’t have the car directly outside, I’d have it on the other side of the street. So you’d get hit by a car trying to run to your new car.

Kanye West: (09:32)
And that’s what social media…Quiet. That’s what social media does. It gets you excited about things. It gets you turned up about things. It gets you running around and I’m just walk…I don’t know where these bricks come from, but I’m going to use them.

Kanye West: (09:33)
Wait a second, where did the bricks come from though? Did you put the bricks in the street?

Audience: (09:33)
No.

Kanye West: (09:33)
Did you put the bricks in the street? I’m not talking about the riots, I’m talking about the bricks in the 80s.

Audience: (09:33)
Oh.

Kanye West: (09:33)
We’re ready.

Lauren: (10:07)
Education is an important topic. Education…

[inaudible 00:10:07]

Kanye West: (10:09)
We have no microphone.

[inaudible 00:10:09]. You got it.

Lauren: (10:09)
Education starts everything. Education starts people who are in our police force, in our healthcare force, in our political force. So, if we’re not educated properly, how can we live in America if we don’t even have the education to live in America. I grew up in Tulsa. I grew up right here surrounded by white people. There’s nothing wrong with white people, but you live with a whole different perspective than everybody else. I lived with a whole different perspective than everybody else and we need to change everything, so we can begin to change.

Lauren: (10:42)

[inaudible 00:10:42], with people in our society. And I think healthcare is so important because if people don’t have access to healthcare, how can people live their life? How can you live your life if you don’t feel comfortable going to the doctor’s, don’t feel comfortable going to vote, if you’re not able to go and vote?

Kanye West: (11:09)
Okay, so I stubbed my toe. Two years ago. And went to the doctor because you know I’ve got to 

[inaudible 00:11:09], I got to take everything quite serious. I’m not just going to take some ointment or whatever, I’m going to go to the hospital. So, when I got there, 5 doctors asked me if I wanted pain medication. At the end of the year, they give out awards for people who have given out the most medication.

Kanye West: (11:26)
In Europe, there’s a higher threshold for pain. I got plastic surgery to try to look young and try to look like I needed to be on TV out in Los Angeles. You heard a small clip of that on TMZ. After getting the plastic surgery, that was a slippery slope to being addicted to Percocet.

Kanye West: (11:34)
Percocet released serotonin and endorphins in your mind that are similar to when you have an orgasm and are also a cousin and a sister of heroin. So, basically, some could say I was addicted to a smaller form of heroin. And I would live in this 

[inaudible 00:11:34] mansion in the state of community with my Maybach and I would drive to Calabasas high as a motherf***er. That’s the one that my dad is sitting at home waiting for Fox News to run that.

Kanye West: (12:34)
It said he was high as a mother-…No, because I went through a process of one thing leading to the next thing, leading to the next thing, leading to the next…No, because the next thing is the same thing. It’s a cycle. It’s the same thing. We are trapped in a loop. We are going to break that trap.

Kanye West: (12:55)
Uno memento…wait you come here for the next statement…you said can I…who’s the person that said can I ask? You said can I ask something? Okay, you stand up here, I would like for her to finish…”Imma let you finish”

Lauren: (12:55)
Okay, well I have a statement about pride and how it’s different…

Kanye West: (12:55)
About pride.

Lauren: (13:41)
Yeah, different places in the United States are trying to 

[inaudible 00:13:41]. I grew up in 

[inaudible 00:13:41]. I repeat 

[inaudible 00:13:48]. 

[inaudible 00:13:47], they would get in trouble for it, but other people wouldn’t. The same thing happens at school, if you get into a fight at school, some people get in trouble. 

[inaudible 00:13:55], dropped out of school and straight into jail. But other schools, you can get into a fight and you’re back in class that day or the next day. It’s not a fair 

[inaudible 00:14:03]. If we don’t acknowledge that, nothing’s going to change. There’s still white people, black people, every single person 

[inaudible 00:14:09], truly acknowledge that there is a difference between ways that we’re raised and the way we experience the world.

Lauren: (13:41)
And I think, hey we got celebrities. We have Kanye, but we also have so many other celebrities that represent so many people in the United States and its not fair.

Kanye West: (14:51)
I understand that there was a very, very hopeful moment that you had to experience for four years when I wore the Trump hat for four years. I’m going to explain to you that Democrats ain’t get sh** for blacks. And the most racist thing that’s ever been said out loud is the idea that if Kanye West runs for president, I’m going to split the Black votes.

Kanye West: (14:55)
This reminded me, what was Samuel L. Jackson’s character in Django? 

[crosstalk 00:14:59].

Kanye West: (14:58)
Stephen…Okay, right, right. I’m not trying to quiet your voices actually. So, I don’t want to say that in an improper way, I just haven’t had the time to word it in the most elegant way possible. So, that’s a Stephen move. When Harriet Tubman, well Harriet Tubman never actually freed the slaves, she just had the slaves go work for other white people.

Kanye West: (15:38)
The National Basketball Association is not owned by any blacks. Universal Music is not owned by any blacks. Any celebrity that you see talking is not the real power.

Kanye West: (16:03)
Talking is not the real power because the real power that I am putting my line on the life today to speak about, you don’t see them. You don’t see the real power. You don’t know who’s putting the Internet near schools just to trap you. You don’t know who’s talking to you. Black women in between the ages of 12 to 21 that follows this person in order to buy this product. You don’t know who’s the head of the boards.

Kanye West: (16:41)
In risk or no risk of losing whatever deal possible, I am not on the board at Adidas. I am not on the board at GAP and that has to change today or I walk away. Because don’t believe that because they put the second woman, not the first on the bus, the first woman…you know that story where I am going right? There was a girl, do you remember her name? Not Rosa Parks. There was a dark skinned woman, what was she 15? 15. She was pregnant out of wedlock, so she couldn’t start the movement. She couldn’t put the bricks in the streets. I don’t know much about George Soros in all honesty. I do not know much about this man, so I will not bear false witness. I need to educate myself more about these. But also these things is, we pinpoint names.

Kanye West: (17:59)
We pinpoint people, we attack each other. We are all equal in God’s eyes. Sometimes, people are controlled by demons. Sometimes, people are controlled by the environment that we are in, but we are all God’s people. There’s no bad people. There are lost people, but we are all God’s people. There’s not left, right, red, blue. That’s why everybody here is purple today. And everyone, I’ve never got next to someone who didn’t get more prosperous because of it. George Soros, I know, know how to make homes in one day. Well, we’re doing the same thing. We’re making homeless shelters, so I would like to meet with George Soros, on that. Mark Zuckerberg would like to bring the Internet into Africa. Okay, well let’s beat Mark Zuckerberg because when you went to Africa, they said no. China is buying land in Africa. Okay, well my deal with Adidas is no longer that I get a 15% royalty, I’m giving them the 15% royalty.

Kanye West: (19:15)
Wait a second, I don’t want to hear…I’ll let you know when I’m finished with my thoughts. And I would prefer 10, I like multiples of 20, but I’m giving them a 15% royalty, but because of their 15% royalty, it made me into a billionaire. Which could make me, on this piece alone, at 0 tomorrow. But when God calls Moses, he has to leave his comfy job working for the Egyptians and free the people. And the freedom does not come from an election. The freedom comes from you not loading up pornography. The freedom comes from you not taking the Percocet. The freedom comes from you not doubting your brother and your sister. The freedom comes from you putting that gun down and not shooting people at the gas station. It has nothing to do with thos election. It only has to do with God and God’s people. He sent pause

Kanye West: (20:24)
He set pause for us to take a moment and breathe and not TikTok ourselves out. He sent pause for us, now we have a moment to breathe. It has nothing to do with black, white, rich, poor, red, blue, Native American, pilgrim. It has to deal with being truthful to what God has.

Kanye West: (20:47)
I see you have your hands up, walk up here, you’re going to get your chance…yes you, young lady walk up here.

Kanye West: (21:05)
Now let me tell you something, I heard you. All right, let me tell you…I’ll talk about Planned Parenthood. So…one more minute sir we can talk. I’m going to have my talk and then I’m going to do Planned Parenthood.

Kanye West: (21:09)
So…

[inaudible 00:21:10] 

[inaudible 00:21:10] most likely speak Spanish here. No… we’re going to be 

[inaudible 00:21:26] most original languages and we, all these people,

[inaudible 00:21:26]. So, and there are illegal, so called…, there’s no such thing as an illegal immigrant. People have been working here and supporting the world, then they need the opportunity for the freedom and the state of a…for the country that they’ve worked for. Let me go to Planned Parenthood.

Kanye West: (21:47)
The statement is, in the Bible, its says Thou should not kill. I remember that my girlfriend called me screaming and crying and I was just thinking. Because at that time I was a rapper, I was out there, I had some girlfriends and everything and I just thought to myself I want to word this in a way that, hey I don’t give a f***, I’m going to word it like 

[inaudible 00:22:16].

Kanye West: (22:19)
So my girlfriend called me and I just thought to myself, please don’t tell me I get it 

[inaudible 00:22:23] that sh** AIDS, that’s going to be rude. Quiet down. Then she said, I’m pregnant. And I said, yes, and then I said, no.

Kanye West: (22:22)
So, I’m going to tell you what was in my mind. She was crying, she said I just came from the doctor, and said Oh my God 

[inaudible 00:22:52]. Because I was having like a rapper’s lifestyle. So, she said she was pregnant and for one month and two months and three months, we talked about her and I having this child. She had the pills in her hand. You know these pills, that if you take it, it’s a wrap, the baby’s gone. So, I was sitting up in Paris and I had my leather pants on.

Kanye West: (23:19)
You already know if you got leather pants on, you already know who this person must think they are, right? And I’m in the apartment where my wife was actually robbed and I had my laptop that got all of my creative ideas. I got my shoes, I got my sound cover, I got communities, I got clothes, I got all this and the screen was black and white. And God said, If you f*** with my vision, I’m going to f*** with yours. And I called my wife and she said we’re going to have this baby. I said we’re going to have this child.

Kanye West: (24:03)
I know people who are 50 years old that didn’t have children. They didn’t have that child. That have never got to experience the level, the level of joy that I’ve experienced in having a child. So even if my wife were to divorce me, after this speech, she brought North into the world, even when I didn’t want to. She stood up and she protected that child.

Kanye West: (24:30)
You know who else protected a child? Who do you think might’ve protected a child? 43 years ago, who protected a child? My mom. My mom saved my life. My dad wanted to abort me. My mom saved my life. There would have been no Kanye West because my dad was too busy.

Kanye West: (24:58)

[inaudible 00:24:58].

Audience: (24:58)
We love you Kanye.

Kanye West: (24:58)
I almost killed my daughter. I almost killed my daughter.

Kanye West: (28:50)
And then they said to me, You can’t, you can’t tell them about this story, you’re going to lose your drop deal. They made me put a 

[inaudible 00:28:50] deal over my daughter. They made me put an Adidas deal over my daughter. They’re going to run this. They’re going to try to tell you that I’m crazy, the world’s crazy. I love my daughter.

Kanye West: (28:50)
My idea…no, no, no. Everyone quiet down. No more Plan B, Plan A. Anyone who is pregnant, you have an option of $50,000 a year that I will support with the organizations that I make, to take care of the child. You have the Plan A option. Are you saying no, you can’t have a Plan A option?

Audience: (28:50)
No.

Kanye West: (28:50)
Calm down everyone. Calm down. Everyone be quiet.

Speaker 1: (28:51)
What about women who got raped? What about women with mental illness? 

[inaudible 00:28:51] What about our right to take care of a kid? You want them to take care of a kid? Are you, is that what you’re proposing? $50,000 a year for what? For a crazy lady to take care of a baby?

Kanye West: (28:51)
Now everyone be quiet so you can hear us. 

[inaudible 00:27:18]. Steve Jobs is adopted. You are adopted. You are adopted. It actually, the whole thing is villages. It takes a village to raise a child. No matter how much money you have, you need grandmothers, you need friends, you need people.

Speaker 1: (28:51)
Single moms with no family. Single moms…

Kanye West: (28:51)
Exactly. Because the society has been set up for single moms to not have a village, to not have a job. 

[inaudible 00:27:47]. How many people have to drive 45 minutes to get to their job here? So, I moved to a small town in Cody, Wyoming where people can walk. A four-year-old can walk from school to home safely. We, there’s a lot of policies that only relate to what Rockefeller, du Pont, and Cotton set up. You understand what you guys are talking…you guys might want to say in front of me, f*** you Kanye. You realize that I am putting my life on the line for the truth. Right now.

Audience: (28:51)
Yes.

Speaker 1: (28:51)
Kanye, I love you. 

[inaudible 00:28:18]. You are one of the most creative guys on planet Earth, but I also disagree with you on Planned Parenthood. I don’t think we should get rid of Plan B. I don’t think we should get rid of abortions.

Kanye West: (28:51)
Let me tell you. The Bible says…

Speaker 1: (28:56)
The Bible says a lot of things. The Bible says a lot of things. Jesus had 12 male disciples and that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.

[inaudible 00:28:56].

Kanye West: (29:10)
When I said I had…

[inaudible 00:29:10].

[inaudible 00:29:21]. Amber Rose. People told me to not date this woman because she was a stripper. There was a lot of comparison to Mary Magdalene. We went to the Vatican together and there was a painting by Raphael and the Christian community might not like this, but there was a smudge next to Jesus at The Last Supper. And the person who showed the painting said, that was Mary. And Amber Rose saw that and started crying. She saw that, that the church tried to erase those who weren’t good enough as they saw it in the world.

Kanye West: (30:06)
Amber started crying when she saw that. That’s what I mean by that. Jesus loved all people. And when people talk about profanity and different things and God wants us to create is what I’m saying. But in the state that we live in right now, we eat meat, I hunt meat. In the Garden of Eden we didn’t have to. In this state right now if someone is raped in the…I understand why someone would make the choice of getting a divorce. I mean getting a divorce 

[inaudible 00:30:35], I mean of getting an abortion.

Kanye West: (30:39)
I understand if a person, if a father, is not there. And I’ll be done with this point in about two minutes, let me get it out. I understand if a person is in an impoverished community, why, or if they are impoverished they can’t afford their fifth or sixth or their seventh child, or even their first child. I understand the situation that someone would be in. God would still make it rain. God will make it rain and those people who have never met someone who has said, I had this child and it was the worst thing.

Kanye West: (31:16)
People always say, God made a way. I had this child and it was the best thing. Society has set it up in a way where we feel that God won’t make a way. When I was 53 million dollars in debt, I was in the crazy home and as soon as I say Jesus name out loud, he gave me increase. He gave me a platform, he gave me sanity, he gave me clarity to be able to speak not on the word of Yeezus and Yeso like in a rap, but on the word of Jesus and community and family. So what I’m saying is, we understand, we’re not going to go back to women having to go in an alley and do crazy type of things. We understand the conditions. We understand the conditions of black people in America and why we break every store that’s there. We understand the conditions.

Kanye West: (32:03)
Break every store that’s there. We understand the conditions of women in America. We understand that we live in a white supremacist world, and until that is equalized, people stand on rights that make them more equal. The idea of a woman having a choice, I understand because it says “Hey, I can do this stuff.”

Kanye West: (32:24)
When a black man breaks, gets mad, raps, plays ball, wears gold chains. I got gold teeth. My bottom teeth are removed for my gold teeth, and partially it’s because I can do that. 

[crosstalk 00:32:39] So I understand the risk. And here goes the liberals, “He compared abortion to gold teeth.” Hey, let me explain something to liberals, though.

Georgia: (33:00)
What are you? Nothing? 

[crosstalk 00:33:00]

Kanye West: (33:07)
I am Christian, but also I am a listener. You cannot lead without listening. This is the reason… What’s your name? This is the reason why Georgia, where I was born, must express their self. People saw me put up a tweet where I showed the six month baby.

Speaker 2: (33:18)
Why’d you delete it?

Kanye West: (33:24)
Because I was pressured by the forces that were around me. Now what I’m saying is, I’ve even heard that they can abort a baby up to eight months, but I wanted to show everyone… In the same way when I got into a car accident, and I showed a picture of my face, I wanted to show everyone exactly what the six month baby that is legal to be destroyed in 

[inaudible 00:33:43] looked like. And then I got social media backlash. Bot, I backstroke the backlash.

Kanye West: (34:00)
What I want to say is, I understand with where we are today, why if a woman was raped, why… You see, but the thing is, let me give you an example. Women love My Body, My Choice. That is a great example. 

[crosstalk 00:34:23] Does anyone know 

[crosstalk 00:34:23] TMZ.

Speaker 2: (34:23)
F*** TMZ!

Kanye West: (34:23)

[crosstalk 00:34:23] quiet down, right? So let’s say when the baby is conceived, at that point it is a soul. It is a real, living thing. That six month year old baby, that’s a real living thing. Do we agree that that was a real baby? That six month old baby?

Audience: (34:35)
Yeah.

Kanye West: (34:37)
Okay, so My Body, My Choice. Say we were to separate with the baby’s mama and y’all had an argument, and you got a one year old. Be like, basically um, 18 months older than the tweet I sent out. Y’all get in an argument and she says, “My house, my choice. I’m going to kill your child.” You know what I’m saying? Because when a baby is accepted, it is real. It is real at that point, says I. I don’t give a f*** if I win presidency or not. You know what I’m saying? I’m not here to 

[crosstalk 00:35:22].

Kanye West: (35:23)
I care that it’s homeless people in front of the Gucci store. I care that it’s people that are put in situations where they will never know how much 

[inaudible 00:35:31] because the way society sets things up. I care about these things and I am in service to God. I don’t know, I’m like an employee 

[crosstalk 00:35:39] this weekend. Nothing will happen to me because God has the plan for us, as his people, to be finally free. 

[crosstalk 00:35:50]

Kanye West: (35:34)
How do we disobey? When we kill, we disobey. How else do we disobey?

Speaker 2: (35:34)
When we steal.

Georgia: (35:34)
When we lie.

Kanye West: (35:34)
When we steal. How else?

Georgia: (35:34)
When we lie.

Kanye West: (35:34)
Lie.

Audience: (35:34)
Cheat.

Kanye West: (36:06)
When we cheat. When we not love our neighbor. These are these things. Politics, America, Trump, Biden, nor Kanye West can free us. The only thing that can free us is by obeying the rules that were given to us for a promised land. 

[crosstalk 00:36:25] I don’t think the last… 

[inaudible 00:36:29] a woman who stood up here and we have the perspective of so many women in the world. You get the last word.

Audience: (36:53)

[inaudible 00:36:53] Talk up! 

[inaudible 00:37:02] 

[crosstalk 00:37:12]

Kanye West: (37:19)
Wait, wait, wait. Everybody, if everyone just got quiet while Georgia talks, this would be over right now. And if this is over right now, guess what else is over right now? I’m over. And if I’m over right now, guess what else is over. The country’s over right now. Everyone pay the same respect to Georgia that you paid to me. She openly opened up to you guys, to me, on a platform and said she had an abortion a few months ago. And her maternal instincts were that she wanted to have the baby, but she felt she couldn’t support the baby on $9 minimum wage.

Georgia: (38:04)
I just think my 

[inaudible 00:38:04]. I don’t think we should say 

[crosstalk 00:38:15].

Kanye West: (38:20)
Let me explain something to you guys. My stance is not to make abortion illegal at all. It should always be legal, but there should be an option of maximum increase for 

[crosstalk 00:38:31]. Abortion should be legal, because guess what? The law is not by God even. So what’s legality? 30 states still execute men that did not do the crime that they are being executed for, and modern day mass incarceration is slavery. In 2020, abortion should be legal, but the option of maximum increase should be available. 

[crosstalk 00:39:11]

Kanye West: (39:14)
Maximum increase would be everybody that has a baby gets a million dollars, or something like that. 

[crosstalk 00:39:20] Oh, wait, wait. Says the person that’s worked five 

[crosstalk 00:39:29]. We would fund it from other countries. With other continents. There are Israeli continents that you do not believe. There are African continents that, the African continent, the continent of Africa. Israel and Africa that would fund a concept like this. 

[crosstalk 00:39:57]

Kanye West: (39:57)
When you put an idea out. I remember I was supposed to do a couple songs at the MTV Awards, right? And then I said, “Bro.” And then what else did I say? I said, “Listen to the 

[crosstalk 00:40:21], bro. Listen to the kids, bro.” And are we running in 2020?

Audience: (40:29)
Yep. Yeah.

Kanye West: (40:31)
Okay, so tell me this. If you had had the opportunity to be given a million dollars just for being pregnant, would you have considered? And then everybody would start making children? The greatest gift of life? Maybe there would be a million children on this f***ing beautiful place? 

[crosstalk 00:41:02] But wait a minute, calm down, calm down. So she’s saying I don’t have the funding… Wait a second. Be quiet for a second, please. I do not have the funding for it, but I have the platform to present the idea for those who do. 

[crosstalk 00:41:12]

Kanye West: (41:12)
Let me elaborate on that. But the thing is, the first thing I said was, “I’m about a 

[crosstalk 00:41:13] thousand dollar stipend,” but that’s not going to work because I just listened to what Georgia said. Georgia said, “Okay, this person is mentally ill. This person is 

[crosstalk 00:41:41].” Then I went into the designing community and said that it takes a village to raise a child. It’s not simply a money situation; it is a people situation. It is a heart situation. It is a spirituality situation. It is a God situation. It is a family situation. Money can’t fix things. Money’s not even real. Is bit coin real? Does the gold back the money? At what point can someone just pressed delete and turn the lights out, al
