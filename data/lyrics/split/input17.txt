self, and I
(My eyes have cried a thousand times)
I have cried so many times
(I can't regret time spent with you)
I can't regret time spent with you
(It's how I learned how to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again
(Now I've got me, myself, and I)
Oh! I know that I will never disappoint myself
(My eyes have cried a thousand times)
If you've cried a thousand times
Ladies, you will survive!
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(It's how I learned how to make it through)
I can see the sun shine
I got me, myself, and I

[Verse 1]
I was a terror since the public school era
Bathroom passes, cuttin classes, squeezin asses
Smokin blunts was a daily routine since 13
A chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the trey deuce and a deuce deuce in my bubblegoose
Now I got the mac in my knapsack Loungin black
Smokin sacks up in ac's and sidekicks with my sidekicks rockin fly kicks
Honeys wanna chat but all we wanna know is where the party at
And I can bring ma GAT, if not I hope I dont get shot
Better throw my vest on ma chest cause niggas is a mess
It dont take nothin but frontin for me to start something
Buggin and buckin at niggas like I was duck huntin
Dumbin out just me and my crew
Cause all we wanna do is (The rockaway)

[Hook]
Ma niggas dont dance they just pull their pants and do the rockaway
Lean Back (Brooklyn)

Lean Back, Lean Back, Lean Back

[Verse 2]

F**k up the party before it even start

Or some brand newbian shit beating down punks

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress I think I might just
Hit her wit a little Biggie one-on-one
How to tote a GUN and have fun with Jamaican rum
Conversation, blunts in rotation, ma men big Jock got the GLOCK in his waist and was smokin
Drinking got the Hooker thinking
If money smell bad then this ni**a biggie's stinkin
Is it ma charm I got the Hookers eating out ma palm
She grabbed ma arm and said let's leave calm
Im hitting skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a heineken
Ni**as start to Loc out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a F**KING fight broke out
Can't we just all get along?
So I can put hickeys on ya chest like lil' Shawn

Chorus

[Verse 1]
I can't help myself, I'm addicted to a life of material
It's some kind of joke, I'm obsessively opposed to the typical
All we care about is runway models, Cadillacs and liquor bottles
Give me something I wanna be, retro glamour, Hollywood, yes, we live for the

[Chorus]
Fame (Fame), doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame (Fame), doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we got a taste for champagne and endless fortune

[Post-Chorus]
Fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame
We live for the fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame
Isn't it a shame, shame, baby? A shame, shame
In it for the fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame

[Verse 2]
I can see myself in the movies, with my picture in city lights
Photograph my mind and whatever else you'd like to shoot, you decide
All we care about is pornographic girls on film and body plastic
Give me something I wanna see, television and hot blondes in odd positions

[Chorus]
Fame (Fame), doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame (Fame), doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we got a taste for champagne and endless fortune

[Post-Chorus]
Fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame
We live for the fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame
Isn't it a shame, shame, baby? A shame, shame
In it for the fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame

[Bridge]
Don't ask me how or why
But I'm gonna make it happen this time
My teenage dream tonight
Yeah, I'm gonna make it happen this time
Fame
Fame, doin' it for the fame
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous

[Chorus]
Fame (Fame), doin' it for the fame (Fame)

[Verse 1]
Are we really sure
Can a love that lasted for so long still endure?
Do I, really care? Hey, hey
Let's talk about the distractions goin' on elsewhere

[Chorus]
I keep hearin' footsteps, baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark
Why? I keep hearin' footsteps, baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark, ooh

[Verse 2]
My mind drifts now and then
Lookin' down dark corridors and wonders what might have been
Something's up ahead
Hey, should I keep this same direction or go back instead?

[Chorus]
I, I keep hearin' footsteps, baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark
Why? I keep hearin' footsteps, baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark, ooh

[Verse 3]
Honey, now let's stop walkin' around
When there's love lost to be found
Oh, and you know I still care, I still care
What's the sense in goin' elsewhere?

[Verse 4]
Who feels really sure?
Can that feelin' guarantee your happiness shall endure?
And do we, really care? Hey, hey
Let's look at what's been happenin', try to be more aware

[Chorus]
I, I keep hearin' footsteps, baby
In the dark, in the dark
Why? I keep hearin' footsteps, baby
In the dark, oh, in the dark, ooh

[Verse 5]
Yeah, let's stop walkin' around
Well, when there's love lost, lost to be found
Oh, honey, you know I still care, I still care
What's the sense in goin', goin' elsewhere?

[Outro]
Oh, honey, let's stop walkin' around and around and around
When there's no love to be found
Hey, baby, you know, I still care, I still care
What's the sense of goin', goin' elsewhere?

[Intro]
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby

[Verse 1]
Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now
Oh, because

[Chorus]
My loneliness is killing me (And I)
I must confess, I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

[Verse 2]
Oh, baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you (Oh, yeah)
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, pretty, baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now
Oh, because

[Chorus]
My loneliness is killing me (And I)
I must confess, I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, baby, baby (Oh)
Oh, baby, baby (Yeah)

[Bridge]
Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
I must confess that my loneliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here and give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

[Chorus]
My loneliness is killing me (And I)
I must confess, I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

[Outro]
I must confess (My loneliness)
That my loneliness (Is killing me)
Is killing me now (I must confess, I still believe)
Don't you know I still believe (When I'm not with you)
That you will be here (I lose my mind)
And give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

[Intro]
Turn the lights on

[Verse 1]
How could someone hurt you
But still make you feel so good?
Holler, scream and curse you and you stand there and let them do it
Just 'cause he gives you pain, that don’t mean he ain’t the one
Fuck you out your brain, you’ll be smiling when he’s done

[Pre-Chorus]
So, my advice would be no, don’t leave
Don’t go so easy
Let that argument turn you on
It’s worth it

[Chorus]
And these are the lessons learned by lovers
These are the reasons we make love
There’s no exception, one day
We gotta look each other in the eye
You learn all these lessons when you’re in love
A lesson for the lover (the lover)
A lesson for the lover (the lover)

[Verse 2]
So hard to imagine
Living life without them there
'Cause now you’re so caught up in the passion
But this shit is beyond compare
'Cause don't it make your heart beat, beat, beat like a drum?
You fall hard, but think about how hard you come

[Pre-Chorus]
So, my advice would be no, don’t leave
Don’t go so easy
Let that argument turn you on
It’s worth it

[Chorus]
And these are the lessons learned by lovers
These are the reasons we make love
There’s no exception, one day
We gotta look each other in the eye
You learn all these lessons when you’re in love
A lesson for the lover (the lover)
A lesson for the lover (the lover)
Come here, look at me

[Bridge]
No one wants to be fighting
All day long, all night long
So we'll just scream till we start making love
And as time goes on, we're feeling
Okay, babe, alright, love
And we'll forget about it in the morning

[Chorus]
And these are the lessons learned by lovers
These are the reasons we make love
There’s no exception, one day
We gotta look each other in the eye
You learn all these lessons when you’re in love
A lesson for the lover (the lover)
A lesson for the lover (the lover)

[Verse 1]

Well I'm trapped on a rollercoaster
And they won't let me go, so it's totally bogus
And every single day it gets cold and colder
Till my mood gets low like below the sofa
Can't somebody tell me where to go?
Somewhere far away where it can't go wrong
There's way too many snakes on this globe
Now everybody sing it
Everybody sing it

[Hook]

We Created a monster
Created a monster
But nobody wants him
But nobody wants her
We've created a monster
Created a monster
But nobody wants to kill it
So long
But since there's nowhere to go
I guess I'll be on the road
Wherever my soul will go
Goodbye, so long (where you going?)
Outer space
Outer space
Outer space
Goodbye, so long

[Verse 2]

To get where I am I can give you directions
In the future I can get with the Jetsons
I Need to leave you, someone give me suggestions
Fuck elections the whole planet's infected
Call a doctor I could use an erection
Call the Reverend I could make a confession
It's just like a subatomic nuclear weapon
Everybody's singing Everybody's singing

[Hook]

[Bridge]

Everybody sing it!
I said everybody sing it!
Sing it!

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire

[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

[Verse 2]
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild

[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire

[Outro]
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring...

[Chorus 1]
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

[Chorus 2]
Go tell that long-tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down

[Verse 1]
Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dew
I've been down on bended knee, talkin' to the man from Galilee
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of angel's feet
He called my name and my heart stood still
When he said, "John, go do My will!"

[Chorus 2]
Go tell that long-tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down

[Chorus 1]
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

[Verse 2]
Well, you may throw your rock, and hide your hand
Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
But as sure as God made black and white
What's done in the dark will be brought to the light

[Chorus 1]
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down

[Chorus 2]
Go tell that long-tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down
"I was thinking about you guys yesterday. Now, I've been here three times before, and I think I understand a little bit of how you feel about some things. It's none of my business how you feel about some other things, and I don't give a damn about how you feel about some other things. But anyway, I tried to put myself in your place, and I believe this is how I would feel about San Quentin..."

[Verse 1]
San Quentin, you've been livin' hell to me
You've hosted me since nineteen sixty three
I've seen 'em come and go and I've seen them die
And long ago I stopped asking why

[Verse 2]
San Quentin, I hate every inch of you
You've cut me and have scarred me through and through
And I'll walk out a wiser weaker man
Mister Congressman, you can't understand

[Verse 3]
San Quentin, what good do you think you do?
Do you think I'll be different when you're through?
You bent my heart and mind and you warp my soul
And your stone walls turn my blood a little cold

[Verse 4]
San Quentin, may you rot and burn in hell
May your walls fall and may I live to tell
May all the world forget you ever stood
And may all the world regret you did no good

[Outro]
San Quentin, you've been living hell to me

"Thank you very much. One more time? Maybe before we do it, though, if any of the guards are still speaking to me, can I have a glass of water?"

(laughter, applause)

[Verse 1]
Well, you wonder why I always dress in black
Why you never see bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on

[Verse 2]
I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Living in the hopeless, hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime
But is there because he's a victim of the time

[Verse 3]
I wear the black for those who've never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me

[Verse 4]
Well, we're doing mighty fine, I do suppose
In our streak-of-lightning cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a man in black

[Verse 5]
I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men

[Verse 6]
And I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believing that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundred-thousand who have died
Believing that we all were on their side

[Verse 7]
Well, there's things that never will be right I know
And things need changing everywhere you go
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right
You'll never see me wear a suit of white

[Verse 8]
Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day
And tell the world that everything's okay
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back
Until things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we stopped keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah, I know that we can't do this no more

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again
Making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

[Chorus]
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

[Verse 2]
Try to tell you "no," but my body keeps on telling you "yes"
Try to tell you "stop," but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning, probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up, feeling satisfied, but guilty as hell

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again
Making me love you (Making me love you)
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go (Let it all go)
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo (Like a tattoo, yeah)
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

[Chorus]
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die (Yeah)
That I'll only stay with you one more night (Oh)
And I know I've said it a million times (Yeah)
But I'll only stay with you one more night (Yeah)

[Bridge]
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Yeah, baby, give me one more night
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Yeah, baby, give me one more night (Whoa, yeah)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Yeah, baby, give me one more night
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Oh yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
But baby, there you go again, there you go again
Making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
That I'll only stay with you one more night (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
And I know I've said it a million times
(Oh, I've said it a million times)
But I'll only stay with you one more night
(Yeah, baby, give me one more night)
So I cross my heart and I hope to die (Yeah, yeah)
That I'll only stay with you one more night (Yeah, yeah)
And I know I've said it a million times (Yeah, yeah)
But I'll only stay with you one more night (Yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
I dunno
Whatever, whatever

[Verse 1]
Here I am waiting
I'll have to leave soon
Why am I holding on?
We knew this day would come
We knew it all along
How did it come so fast?

[Pre-Chorus]
This is our last night, but it's late
And I'm trying not to sleep
'Cause I know, when I wake
I will have to slip away

[Chorus]
And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight, I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight, I need to hold you so close

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa

[Verse 2]
Here I am staring
At your perfection
In my arms, so beautiful
The sky is getting bright
The stars are burning out
Somebody slow it down

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This is way too hard
'Cause I know, when the sun comes up
I will leave, this is my last glance
That will soon be memory

[Chorus]
And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight, I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight, I need to hold you so close

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa

[Bridge]
I never want it to stop
Because I don't wanna start all over, start all over
I was afraid of the dark
But now it's all that I want, all that I want, all that I want

[Chorus]
And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close

[Chorus]
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight, I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight, I need to hold you so close

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa

[Outro]
Ooh-whoa (Yeah), ooh-whoa (Yeah)
Ooh-whoa (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh-whoa (Yeah), ooh-whoa (Yeah), ooh-whoa

[Verse 1]
You're such a motivator, I gotta get you here
So sick of saying yes sir, yes sir
You're such an instigator, you wanna play the game
Take it or leave it, that's her, that's her

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike

[Chorus]
Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike

[Verse 2]
Stuck in her elevator, she take me to the sky
And I don't wanna go down, go down
She said I'll feel you later, go ahead and fantasize
She'll make me want her right now right now

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike

[Chorus]
Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike

[Bridge]
Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake
Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake

[Chorus]
Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike

[Outro]
My lucky strike, my lucky strike
(Oh) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard
Screaming at each other, screaming at each other
Like, "Oh, oh, oh," can't take it anymore
Like a tragedy, like a dark comedy
Laughing at each other, laughing at each other
Like, "Oh, oh, oh," it isn't funny anymore

[Chorus]
I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday
I was the man who never lied, oh-oh-oh
I was the man who never lied, oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Sometimes honesty is the worst policy
Happy ever after, happy ever after
Let it go, you never need to know
I don't wanna be picking up all of these
Tiny little pieces, tiny little pieces
Of your heart, won't do it anymore

[Chorus]
I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday
I was the man who never lied, oh-oh-oh
I was the man who never lied, oh-oh-oh

[Post-Chorus]
I was the...
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh

[Bridge]
In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard
What am I doing in Hollywood Boulevard?
In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard
Screaming at each other, screaming

[Chorus]
I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday (I was the man)
I was the man who never lied (Oh, I was the man)
Never lied until today (Oh-oh)
But I just couldn't break your heart (Oh-oh)
Like you did mine yesterday (Oh, yeah)
I was the man who never lied, oh-oh-oh (Oh, I was the man)
(I was the man) I was the man who never lied, oh-oh-oh (I was the man)

[Outro]
Whoa, yeah

[Verse 1]
I know your insides are feeling so hollow (Ooh)
And it's a hard pill for you to swallow, yeah (Ooh)
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same

[Chorus]
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way

[Verse 2]
You're such a hard act for me to follow (Ooh)
Love me today, don't leave me tomorrow, yeah (Ooh)
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same

[Chorus]
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way

[Breakdown]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
I don't know where to start, I'm just a little lost
I wanna feel like we're never gonna ever stop
I don't know what to do, I'm right in front of you
Asking you to stay, you should stay, stay with me tonight, yeah

[Chorus]
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way

[Breakdown]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
You take me all the way, you take me all the way, yeah

[Verse 1]
Baby, it's not alright
The second that you turn your back, she'll be outta sight
Baby, she'll break your heart
The second that you spend the night apart-art

[Pre-Chorus]
How could you do it?
Oh, how could you walk away, from everything we made?
How could you do it?
Oh, you better watch yourself, I think that girl's insane

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's like a cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller

[Verse 2]
Baby, she'll eat you alive
As soon as she smells your blood in the water
You better run to survive
Before she makes you her latest slaughter

[Pre-Chorus]
How could you do it?
Oh, just come back to me
Baby, I'm begging, please
How could you do it?
Oh, she knows I love you still, you're just her latest kill

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's like a cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's like a cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's like a cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller

[Verse 1]
I'm not a fortune teller, I won't be bringing news
Of what tomorrow brings, I'll leave that up to you
I'm not a fortune teller, don't have a crystal ball
I can't predict the future, can't see nothing at all
It doesn't mean I'm afraid of all the things that you say
But I just think we should stay stuck in the moment today
And as the seasons roll by, no matter how hard I try
Summer will end and the leaves will turn again

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why you're acting like this
I don't know why you had to do it again
Why'd you have to go and ruin the night?
Don't worry about tomorrow's mess

[Chorus]
I'll never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change, but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller

[Verse 2]
I don't like watching TV, I don't know what it all means
And your American dream, baby, it just isn't me
I know what I'm thinking may not be on your mind
I know the song I'm singing is not your favorite kind
It doesn't mean I'm afraid of all the things that you say
But I just think we should stay stuck in the moment today
And as the seasons roll back, no matter how hard I try
Summer will end and the leaves will turn again

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why you're acting like this
I don't know why you had to do it again
Why'd you have to go and ruin the night?
Don't worry about tomorrow's mess

[Chorus]
I'll never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change, but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller

[Bridge]
This feeling keeps growing
These rivers keep flowing
How can I have answers
When you drown me in questions?

[Chorus]
I'll never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change, but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change, but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller

[Verse 1]
Man, it's been a long day
Stuck thinking 'bout it driving on the freeway
Wondering if I really tried everything I could
Not knowing if I should try a little harder

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread

[Chorus]
I'm kicking the curb, 'cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have
I'm so sad, sad

[Verse 2]
Man, it's been a long night
Just sitting here trying not to look back
Still looking at the road we never drove on
And wondering if the one I chose was the right one

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread

[Chorus]
I'm kicking the curb, 'cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have
I'm so sad, sad
So sad, so sad

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread

[Chorus]
I'm kicking the curb, 'cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have
And I'm kicking the curb, 'cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
I'm so sad, so sad

[Chorus]
She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow

[Verse 1]
It's funny how you say that you made it on your own
When you haven't worked for anyone your daddy didn't know
You say you got a job, but I don't know what you do
Such a fu-fu-fucking snob that you'll never know the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
You're perfect on the outside, but nothing at the core
It's easy to forget when you show up at my door
Stop messing with my mind, 'cause you'll never have my heart
But your perfect little body ma-ma-makes me fall apart
Your perfect little body ma-ma-makes me fall apart

[Chorus]
She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow

[Interlude]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Verse 2]
I know you wanna stay, but I think that you should go
Cause you got nothing to say, you just sit there on your phone
I try not to give in, but temptation has me lost
So I will do my best to ge-ge-ge-ge-get you off

[Pre-Chorus]
You're perfect on the outside, but nothing at the core
It's easy to forget when you show up at my door
Stop messing with my mind, 'cause you'll never have my heart
But your perfect little body ma-ma-makes me fall apart
Your perfect little body ma-ma-makes me fall apart

[Chorus]
She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow

[Interlude]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah

[Chorus]
She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow
She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow

[Outro]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

[Intro]
Oh!
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Hey you, don't wanna love you on the telephone
You're hanging up and I am all alone
Baby, you got me doin' dirt, doin' dirt, doin' dirt
And now, I wanna find you, but you're on the run
My heart's exploding like a burning sun
I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts, when it hurts

[Chorus]
Hold me, we're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up when I get inside
So won't you touch me?
'Cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up, baby, make it loud

[Verse 2]
Hey you, say that you're only havin' fun, and then
You call me up at 3 AM again
Baby, you got me doin' dirt, doin' dirt, doin' dirt
And now (Now) all that I got is just a microphone
To let you know that I am all alone
I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts, when it hurts (Oh)

[Chorus]
Hold me, we're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up when I get inside
So won't you touch me?
'Cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up, baby, make it loud

[Interlude]
Yeah, come on

[Bridge]
So right now, I wanna leave with you right now
I wanna be with you all night, get in the car and let's go
Yeah, let's take it home, let's take it home, let's take it home
So right now, I wanna leave with you right now
I wanna be with you all night, get in the car and let's go
Yeah, let's take it home, let's take it home, let's take it home (Oh)

[Chorus]
Hold me, we're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up when I get inside
So won't you touch me?
'Cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up, baby, make it loud

[Verse 1]
I count the ways I let you down
On my fingers and toes, but I'm running out
Clever words can't help me now
I grip you tight, but you're slipping out

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, so in love that night
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry

[Chorus]
Beautiful goodbye (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Your beautiful goodbye, whoa (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
When did the rain become a storm?
When did the clouds begin to form?
Yeah, we got knocked off course by a natural force
And we'll, we'll be swimming when it's gone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, so in love that night
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry

[Chorus]
Beautiful goodbye (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Your beautiful goodbye, whoa (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Oh, yeah

[Bridge]
All the pain you try to hide
Shows through your mascara lines
As they stream down from your eyes
And let them go, let them fly
Holding back won't turn back time
Believe me, I've tried

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And your eyes were so bright
I remember your eyes were so bright
And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, how in love were we that night?
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry

[Chorus]
Beautiful goodbye (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Oh, yeah
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Your beautiful goodbye, whoa (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, yeah
Hee, oh

[Verse 1]
Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people
Clinging on to bottles
And when it comes it's so, so disappointing

[Chorus]
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

[Verse 2]
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel

[Pre-Chorus]
One day I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and

[Chorus]
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

[Bridge]
Let down again
Let down again
Let down again

[Verse 3]
You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapsing
Floating, bouncing back

[Pre-Chorus]
And one day
I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
(You know where you are)
Hysterical and useless
(You know where you are)
Hysterical and
(You know where you are)

[Chorus]
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

[Verse 1]
There's a wild wind blowing down the corner of my street
Every night there, the headlights are glowing
There's a cold war coming on the radio, I heard
Baby, it's a violent world

[Chorus]
Love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?
I can hear it coming, I can hear the siren sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

[Verse 2]
Time came a-creeping and time's a loaded gun
Every road is a ray of light
It goes on, time only can lead you on
Still it's such a beautiful night

[Chorus]
Love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?
I can hear it coming like a serenade of sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

[Outro]
Gravity, release me and don't ever hold me down
Now my feet won't touch the ground

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Chyeah
One time for your mind, ladies and gentlemen

You know how it goes

I spent the night to rock
But this writer's block is kinda like the cops
Holdin' me back, I keep my dro in a sack (Yeah)
So while I'm holdin' this track (Uh-huh), I keep my mind straight (Yeah)
MC's fold and collapse due to the crime rates
So I dip and climb gates, you never see me where you find jake
Kid who rhymes great takin' it back for old times sake
Times change and no one wasn't with you in the past
But I was lettin' records spin while I was sittin' in the class (Believe)
I take two hits and pass while I listen to this jazz
Walkin' home alone to find some kids to whip they ass (Haha)
'Cause fuck it
See, the streets is cold, they might be eatin' your soul
Rollin' with dough like a pizza roll (Yup)
I used to steal lil' shit out the convenient store
They used to catch me, ask me "Mac, what you need this for?"
I said, "It's just a tootsie roll, can I please just go?"
Paradise, I believe I'm home, yo, yo

[Chorus: Teressa LaGamba]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
They act like I ain't never have to face the heat
'Cause I got a place to sleep and a plate to eat
I come reelin', on the real, I gotta thank my moms
'Cause there ain't shit wrong with makin' songs (Nope)
So let's blaze this bomb 'til the haze is gone (Uh-huh)
I write shit, you copy and paste your songs (Biter!)
Goddamn, I'm makin' these hot jams
And I ain't showin' love to the dudes that's not fam (Nope)
My words sizzle over these beats like hot pans
I got fans, so I plot plans for the top stands (On top)
And when that day comes, homie, I'ma stay young
Like Peter Pan, even if I'm sleepin' in a van
I just need a couple grams so I can feed a strugglin' fam
I got a dream to see some seats that's filled with fans (Uh-huh)
Paradise (Yeah), no easy street
So if I get hungry, I'ma eat this beat (Peace)

[Chorus: Teressa LaGamba]
Take me to paradise

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg, Chris Parnell, & Both]
Lazy Sunday, wake up in the late afternoon
Call Parnell just to see how he's doin'
Hello? What up, Parns? Yo, Samberg, what's crackin'?
You thinking what I'm thinking? Narnia! Man, it's happenin'
But first, my hunger pains are sticking, like duct tape
Let's hit up Magnolia and mack on some cupcakes
No doubt that bakery's got all the bomb frostings
I love those cupcakes like McAdams loves Gosling

[Verse 2: Andy Samberg, Chris Parnell, & Both]
Two; no, six; no, twelve, baker's dozen!
I told you that I'm crazy for these cupcakes, cousin
Yo, where's the movie playin'? Upper West Side, dude
Well, let's hit up Yahoo! Maps to find the dopest route
I prefer MapQuest; that's a good one, too
Google Maps is the best; true that; double true!
68th and Broadway; step on it, sucka
What you wanna do, Chris? Snack attack, motherfucker!

[Chorus: Andy Samberg & Chris Parnell]
It's the Chronic—what?—cles of Narnia
Yes, the Chronic—what?—cles of Narnia
We love that Chronic—what?—cles of Narnia
Pass that Chronic—what?—cles of Narnia

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg & Chris Parnell]
Yo, stop at the deli, the theater's overpriced
You've got the backpack? Gonna pack it up nice
Don't want security to get suspicious
Mr. Pibb and Red Vines equals crazy delicious
I'll reach in my pocket, pull out some dough
Girl acting like she never seen a ten befo'
It's all about the Hamiltons, baby
Throw the snacks in a bag and I'm ghost like Swayze

[Verse 4: Andy Samberg, Chris Parnell, & Both]
Roll up to the theater; ticket buying, what we're handlin'
You can call us Aaron Burr from the way we're dropping Hamiltons
Now parked in our seats, movie trivia's the illest
"What Friends alum starred in films with Bruce Willis?"
We answered so fast it was scary
Everyone stared in awe when we screamed "Matthew Perry!"
Now, quiet in the theater or it's gonna get tragic
We're bout to get taken to a dream world of magic, with

[Chorus: Andy Samberg & Chris Parnell]
It's the Chronic—what?—cles of Narnia
Yes, the Chronic—what?—cles of Narnia
We love that Chronic—what?—cles of Narnia
Pass that Chronic—what?—cles of Narnia

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
It goes a one, two, three

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I was born with the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun
I don't need to sweat it when a competition come
Original style like an 808 drum
So I don't run the track, no, I make the track run
My mama taught me words, my daddy built rockets
I put 'em both together, now tell me what I got
It's a pretty smart weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it like that

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
It ain't over 'cause the shark's on the left side, the snake's on the right
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
'Cause once they get their teeth in, nothing really fights
And as for me, I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like you can try to fill my shoes
But steady, little soldier, I ain't standing next to you
I'd be laying on the ground before you're even in my view like that

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
And when the last bells ring, the poor men sing
"Bring me to kingdom come"

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda]
It's something for your people on the block to black out and rock to
Give me what you need like poppa, who shot you?
"Separate the weak from the obsolete"
You're meek, I creep hard on impostors
And switch styles on a dime, quick-witted
Y'all quit tripping, I don't have time for your crying
I grind tough, sucker, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the lineup?
Bang, bang, little monkey man, playing with the big guns
Only get you slain, I ain't playing, I'm just saying
You ain't got a sliver of a chance
I get iller, I deliver while you quiver in your pants
So shake, shake down, money, here's the breakdown
You can play the bank, I'mma play the bank takedown
And no mistakes now, I'm coming to get you
I'm just a Banksy, you're a brainwash
Get the picture? It's like that

[Outro: Brad Delson]
We swim against the rising waves
And crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
The early morning sings no more
So rest your head, it's time to sleep
And dream of what's in store
The body bends until it breaks
And sings again no more
'Cause time has torn the flesh away
The early morning sings no more

[Verse 1]
No, no! she can't take your mind and leave
I know it's just another trick she's got up her sleeve
I can't believe that she really wants you to die
After all its more than enough to pay for your lie

[Chorus]
Wait a minute, watch what you're doing with your time
All the endless ruins of the past must stay behind, yeah
Wait a minute, watch what you're doing with your time
All the endless ruins of the past must stay behind, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Wait a minute, watch what you're doing with your time
All the endless ruins of the past must stay behind, yeah
Wait a minute, watch what you're doing with your time
All the endless ruins of the past must stay behind, yeah

[Verse 2]
Well, can't you see that you're killing each others soul
Well, you're both out in the streets and you got no place to go
Your constant baits are getting to be a bore
So go somewhere else and continue your cream puff war

[Outro]

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

[Hook]
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
In my scarecrow dreams
When they smash my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting through concrete
Be a cartoon heart
Light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart
We'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark

[Hook]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
We'll be glowing in the dark
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-wooh

[Bridge]
All the boys, all the girls
All that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls
All the madness that occurs
All the highs, all the lows
As the room a-spinning goes
We'll run riot
We'll be glowing in the dark

[Hook]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ah

[Outro]
So we'll soar
Luminous and wired
We'll be glowing in the dark

[Verse 1]
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again

[Verse 2]
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again

[Chorus]
However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you

[Verse 3]
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again

[Chorus]
However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you
However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I'll always love you

[Outro]
I'll always love you
'Cause I love you
Love, love

[Intro: All]
How you feeling, Ad-Rock?
Well, I'm feeling well
Bonafide, qualified, with a story to tell

How you feeling, Mike D?
Well, I feel all good
All day it's how we play in the neighborhood

How you feeling, MCA?
Well, I feel right
I speak my words on the track cause the track sounds tight

Well, if you're feeling good and you're feeling right
Uh, somebody step up and grab the mic

[Verse 1: Ad-Rock]
Now hello everybody and how you been?
It's Ad-Rock rappin' on the microphone again
I got grace, class, style, finesse, and debonair
Murdalize motherfuckers cause I just don't care
The Emcee Whisperer, kinda like a trainer
I take sucker rappers, I put 'em through a strainer
Like macaroni cause the shit sound cheesy
Watch how it's done, boy, it looks easy
The non-stop, goin' off, kingpin, microphone boss
Do my own thing, you can't afford the cost
Of my style, take you through a turnstile
Cause I'm live and direct, and I'm wicked and wild
Because I'm back on a roll, got total control
I flow like the water out your toilet bowl
Your style is cheap, boy, just like a Dutch
You know you're not smokin' on the microphone much
There's a certain special talent that I never lack
Huh-ha, huh-ha, and that's a fact
Cause we shine like the chrome on a Cadillac
You better break a wishbone cause we never wack
Said we're never that and that is that
And we're the nonstop disco powerpack!
Uh, that's right, we go all night
Who gonna be next to bless the mic?

[Interlude: All]
Now this is the way we run it down
We're gettin' you high on the funky sound
This is the way we get it on
B-Boys in the house 'til the break of dawn

[Verse 2: Mike D]
See, I mix my style up like a cement mixer
Smooth and fix ya, like a rhyme elixir
I said, "Yo, sound man, make Mike's mic louder"
Don't make me sound cheap like a box of douche powder
I max and relax, champagne mojito
Don't go commando, don't know bandito
Je m'appelle Michel Pérignon
Me and Claude in the chateau and we got it going on
Quincy's in the hot tub like it's '73
Looking over his shoulder and he's looking at me
I'm all white in the face, towel around my waist
What's up with that watch inside that glass case?
I go to make my move, sneak out of the place
Undetected, not leaving a trace
Party's done, microphone's wrecked
Wine's been drunk and heads been checked
I see one last profiterole and make my play
And pass the microphone to MCA

[Verse 3: MCA]
Nonstop, on the top, and you clock, when we rock
Never fakin', no mistakin', we be makin' hip hop
(So c'mon everybody get down... yeah)

Now there's a spot check, hit the deck count down
Cause I'm a break it down for you, how we run it down
Pound for pound, keep the bass lines round
I seen you watchin', clockin', jockin' my sound
But, for real, I'm real glad I grew up in hip hop
Still got mad love for a record called "Beat Bop"
It meant a lot spinning on my Walkman
Shout out to the African Bam
And to the S to the P the double O-N-Y
The one MC who you can't deny
I'd listen to the records and they'd inspire
Sit down to write and the pen breathes fire
Construct a rhyme with specific intent
Flowin' from the brain cells, right through the pen
And then I put the book down, grab ahold the mic
Words flowin' so cold, turn water to ice
Come through the wire, saturate the tape
You put me in the mix, nice it up with the plate
And then they press it on wax, sell it in the store
The DJ spin the record out on the dance floor
Comin' through the speakers to shake your eardrum
Brain cells get lit, then you hear where we're comin' from

[Outro: All]
Well, Ad-Rock (huh) get it on
We gonna rock the house until the break of dawn
Mike D, (huh) get it on
We gonna rock the house until the break of dawn
MCA, (a-yeah) get it on
We gonna rock the house until the break of dawn
Beatsie Boys in the house don't stop
Uh, Beastie Boys, Santigold
Let's do this, y'all
Santigold

Let's go!

Santigold:
It's hot here, gotta say it's so
I got you right where I want
Got an honest face so you turn your back
When in doubt, run up your attack
At one time you were slick and your grill was cold
And now funny how the shit gets old
You can run, you can run, but it will catch up
Like now, see me, I'll show you up

Now you wanna get back when you had your shine
But you run the same thing every time when you rhyme
Can't stop, won't stop, no compromise
It's a house of cards built out of lies
Coming down like a bird floating on the mist
Turn on the track, back track, and twist
You work hard to climb the list
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift
I know the danger of a man
Who's been to hell and back again (danger)
Can't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger)
Don't play no game that I can't win (danger)

You're caught now by the skin you're in
In a bind now, your thoughts go to all your sins
Hits much harder back, better count on that
I tell you what we know always holds us back
Now you mutter and you stutter and you putter don't stop
I got in your heart and I shook you up
In a bind, now you're caught by the fear setting in
Choked on the thought that you done it again

I Keep the competition in check
You draft, your plans, at your drafting desk
You try to play to win but now you lost
Like clams with no tartar sauce
Scheming in the attic
Thought you had it
So dramatic
I got the stats, mathematics
Automatic, systematic
She's super bad now
What'cha, what'cha want now?
I know the danger of a man (that's danger)
Who's been to hell and back again (danger)
Can't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger)
Don't play no game that I can't win (danger)
Don't play no game that I can't win (danger)
Don't play no game that I can't win (that's danger)
Don't play no game that I can't win (danger, danger)
Don't play no game that I can't win (that's danger)

I know the danger of a man (that's danger)
Who's been to hell and back again (danger)
Can't tell tomorrow from where he's been (that's danger)
Don't play no game that I can't win (danger)

Don't play no game that I can't win
Don't play no game that I can't win
Mike D:
Fuck! Goddammit, this thing
Alright, wait, hold on, Adam
This thing keeps fallin' off

Mike D:
Woo! Doin' it big! Ah-ah!
I'm like the lyrical, mathematical genius
Splashing like lime juice, you've never seen this
Internationally known, the longest, the leanest
Shout-out to one José Nenis

Ad-Rock:
I hit 'em with the rhyme and the rhyme don't stop
We got the beat and the beat go drop
The ping pong paddle make the battle go pop
Now take a look around this spot

MCA:
I'm seeing every detail like an over-cranked camera
Sleestaks in the back say 'Damn ya'
You say 'I can't' and I say 'Why can't ya?'
Chopping the track in the--in the land of...
Beastie Boys:
You wanna buy this
You wanna take that
Wanna-wanna try this
Wanna-wanna make that
You can't abide this
You wanna fake that
Take a look around you

You wanna buy this
You wanna take that
Wanna-wanna try this
Wanna-wanna make that
You can't abide this
You wanna fake that
Take a look around you

Mike D:
There's a bird in here
That's my DJ, not Doctor Brassiere
Dropping bombs like a bombardier
Like cacao, it's a chocolatier

Ad-Rock:
We're giving y'all a lil slice of heaven
B Boys bringing it back to A7
Deal with the schism, ride on the rhythm
Sweet like pie and the pie's what I give 'em
MCA:
I'll stage a coup and usurp your position
Cause--cause like a Mormon, I'm on a mission
We're audible-visible
Cadence is lyrical
Got the mental and physical
When the moment is critical

Beastie Boys:
You wanna buy this
You wanna take that
Wanna-wanna try this
Wanna-wanna make that
You can't abide this
You wanna fake that
Take a look around you

You wanna buy this
You wanna take that
Wanna-wanna try this
Wanna-wanna make that
You can't abide this
You wanna fake that
Take a look around you

Ruff!
Uh, Lee Majors come again
Mike D:
Like the Six Dil- Million Dollar Man
Woo! Watch out!
In the back of the bus...gonna bust!
Lee Majors style

I said stop! Watch how I flip
Bill Piedmont with the Kung-Fu grip
Haymaker, roundhouse, show can't continue
At the roller rink down in Virginia

Ad-Rock:
Oh, did I spill the beans?
I see your grandpa in Apple Bottom jeans
Von Dutch cap, Ugg boots to match
The word gets out, you can't take it back

MCA:
I'm just a pause tape competition expert winner
Just a doggone, long-armed, tall yarn spinner
You want a battle? Easy now, star
My DJ's so nasty, he needs a sneeze guard

Beastie Boys:
You wanna buy this
You wanna take that
Wanna-wanna try this
Wanna-wanna make that
You can't abide this
You wanna fake that
Take a look around you

You wanna buy this
You wanna take that
Wanna-wanna try this
Wanna-wanna make that
You can't abide this
You wanna fake that
Take a look around you

[Produced by Rick Rubin]

First! First! First!
We're the b-boys, we don't regret
There's nothing wrong with your TV set
We're a gettin' loose
We couldn't be harder
Our beats are bigger and better and longer
Got real rock shit
You must admit
Not fake, not false, not counterfeit
I can play the drums, I can play guitar
Not just b-boys, but real rock stars
Rock, rock rock...

When we blow up your ship, you better hit the deck
You'll walk the plank for your dis
Respect, respect, respect...
If you front on the Rock, best run and hide
If you got static, we'll take it outside
And you start to get dulled by the Beastie Boys
Use real rock beats, show off big toys
Like claps of thunder from the cumulus clouds
Double amp up the beat and make it real loud
Loud...
A, then scratch it...

[Scratching]

Heavy metal tension running through your blood
Too much rock, step off the pud
Too much treble, mid-range, and bass
The beat's so hard, it'll dick your face
You'll crush out hard rock, hard beats
Hard rock, cold rhythms for fanatic freaks
Some people say, "This has been done"
We're here, we're now
And the battle’s won

Fists! Fists! Fists!
Fists of fury in an MC bout
Rock so hard it'll knock you out
The very first bout is a kick in the snout
The beat's so def that you better beware
When you're talkin' bass right in your face
The walls crumble down, destroying the place
The finishing touch is the vocals that slam
The final blow in the five finger jam

Some! Some! Some! Some!
Sometimes I write rhythms
Sometimes I write rhymes
He writes his, and I write mine
Rock 'n roll rhythms are raunchy and raucous
We're from Manhattan, you're from Secaucus
Mike D, Ad-Rock, and MCA
Not before long I can hear you say
In a way these boys got juice
They're goin' off you know they love to get loose
Get loose get loose...
Poose
Gettin' the Ad-Ad-Ad-Rock
MCA Mike D. in the place to be
The Beastie Boys showin' up in toy
That's right
Uh, Uh
In the place to be
You know it, you know it
AdRock, uh uh
When the party gets loose
Slop one, slop one
And your goin' the boots
Everybody gettin' trouble
LOV on the New York C
Double R double R
Better off the by
Just takin' off the jile
Like I lost my style
Gonna' grab my rhyme
All the Negros the got style
Oh...

[Ad libs continue]

[Intro]
Huh, huh, huh, huh
(Oh yeah) Oh yeah
The Pooh Butt Day
One of those (Oh yeah) sticky type of things to 

[?] upon
Check it out (Oh yeah)

[Verse 1: Chaos Kid]
Get up this morning, I'm feeling sleepy as all hell
Went to use the bathroom when I tripped and I fell
All the way downstairs and onto the couch
And I pissed my pants on the way down South
So I went back upstairs to change my underwear
Took a while to get 'em unstuck from my pubic hair
Finally got unzipped I went to put 'em down the street
But then I threw 'em in the garbage cause it all said "Pew"
Hopped in the shower put shampoo in my hair
Went to rinse it out but then the water wasn't there
That damn toilet it must'a went foul
Got another bath to wipe the stuff up with the towel
Went to get my clothes but I couldn't wear the wash
So I sat and played Super Mario on my Nintendo
I was gonna see my girl but I forget that stuff
Man today I just feel like a pooh butt

[Chorus: Chaos Kid]
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I, I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I, I just feel like a pooh butt today

[Verse 2: Chaos Kid]
Now every single day I make habits to get up
But today I just feel like a pooh butt
So I'll stay in bed I don't know whats wrong with me
I'm just taking everything nonchalantly
I just feel like I can't move one muscle
My girlfriend calls me up and tells me now we gotta hustle
My plane leaves to roll about quarter to 8
It's 7:15 looks like I'm gonna be late
Aw, forget that baby said I just can't make it
I know you're disappointed but your gonna have to take it
I'm sick in bed I'm making 

[air-fair footer?]
But before I hung up the phone she told me where I could put it
Comes next day I got a call from M&M he said
"We gotta make a record, get ya butt outta bed"
I said "I ain't doin' nothing, I wish you nothing but luck," he said "What's up?" I said I feel like a pooh butt

[Chorus]
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I, I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I, I just feel like a pooh butt today

[Break: Chaos Kid, M&M]
Yo, you ever have one of those pooie, stinky
Ridiculous, rotten days, M&M?
Man I had one once, check this out

[Verse 3: M&M]
Woke up, 6:30 in the morning, yawning
Gotta get to the recording studio
I gotta get a take done
Put all my rhymes together so I can make one
Get outta bed, fall on my head
Slipped on the rug, I thought I was dead
Cussin', I think my head is busted but it's really nothing
Only a concussion, shake it off, get off the ground
Look around, couldn't find my rhyme sheets
Where'd I put 'em down?
They were just there last night on the chair
Had to look everywhere but couldn't find em anywhere
Go to the basement might of misplaced 'em
Gotta find 'em in hurry but my visions still blurry
Goin' down the stairs, what could happen next?
But, when its this early you can't skip steps
Fallin' head first, as I fall, I curse
Things are lookin' bad, I'mma only get worse
Achin', I shake and I hurt, I stand up slowly
Wiped all the dirt off, memory lapse
I can't remember nothing, think I'll collapse
If you forget the whole thing pause for a second
What was I looking for?
Oh yeah, my rhyme sheets; they might be on the floor
Or on the chair
Wait a minute where am I? I'm in a basement
Damn, how does time fly?
Think for a second, recall my memory
If I was a rhyme sheet, where would I be?
Now I remember, I put em in the closet next to my jacket
So I would'a never lost em
Already 7:00? I've only got an hour to eat breakfast
Get dressed, plus take a shower got undressed
Got the zest off the rack
Turn the water on and I almost had a heart attack
Cold as hell, started to yell, jumped out the shower
And said fuck it, I'll smell
Grabbed the towel off the rack, dried off got dressed
Still had to eat, plus my hair was a mess
I was in a rush, grabbed the brush
And ran, right into the door, on the floor I land
Always to fate now; I know I'm cursed
I think it might help if I open the door first
Tried to turn the handle but I sprained my wrist
But that's what happens on a day like this

[Chorus: M&M]
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I just feel like a pooh butt today

[Break: Chaos Kid, M&M]
Wow, that sounds pretty pooie to me
Now, I'm gonna break it down for all the people who don't know what a pooh butt day is

[Verse 4: M&M]
Now, a pooh butt day is something everybody's had
No particular depression, neither mad or sad
You couldn't see your butt because your butt is what it is
Cause when your feeling like a pooh butt
Then you're feeling like shit
They come up at a certain time, they don't have a season
But most of the time you feel like one for no particular reason
They get a careless attitude, the yucky sensations
Some people won't accept love in a pooie situation
Sittin' on the toilet for an hour or so
Marks on the butt from the seat on the bowl
Grab a toilet paper and the seat and just wipe
When I realize I may have sat the in the seat too tight
So I struggle to 

[?] from a stuck position
But removing myself was an impossible mission
Screaming to get out, I couldn't take it any more
When my mother arrived and knocked upon the door
We pulled and pulled and I was removed from the seat
I couldn't sit down for a whole damn week
Never again will I get caught in that rut
So I can stay fresh instead of feeling like a pooh butt

[Chorus: M&M]
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I, I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I, I just feel like a pooh butt today

[Verse 5: M&M, Manix]
Well the very next day, 

[Unintelligible]
Felt the pooh butt sick but am I defeated I survived
So I went downstairs and managed not to fall
Since I was feeling better I get Manix to call
Well, 

[?] said "Oh," says
"Ey s-wzup whut up, you gotta go?"
"I'm feeling pretty good, what about if I come over?
We can practice for a while, order the pizza, are you sober?"
He said: "I ain't gonna go, nope, I'm not going
You wanna know the reason why I'm sound like 

[?]?
Because I got pneumonia, I'm 

[?] something to do, but uhm
If you could smell the way I'm saying, you'd be saying 'pew!'"
I thought for a second and I said, "I don't get it"
Manix said, "just forget it home's
I ain't going out in this weather
I don't feel like doin' nothing but I leavin' you too it
Don't be comin' over feelin' 'cause i'm feeling like pooh!"
Pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh
Pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh

[Chorus: Manix]
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I, I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I, I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
I just feel like a pooh butt today
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I just feel like a pooh butt today

[Outro: Chaos Kid, M&M]
Pooh butt! I feel like a pooh butt!
Sometimes I feel like a pooh butt!
When you just can't get up
When you feel like you want to stay in bed all day
That's an example of a pooh but day
Ooooooh, pooh butt, oh!
My example of a pooh butt day
Is when you have a foot falls asleep, for the whole day
But you've got a track run at one o'clock!
You know what pisses me off, is when we get all the parts down except James gets a lag on his throat and he fucks up, and you know what else pisses me off is, whatever's pissing me off in that particular moment, that's what's usually pissing me off
I'm gonna end this song by saying, uh
Pooh buuutt!

[Intro]

[Verse 3: DMX]

But if it's gon' be, to be between me and you
Cause when, one start talkin', The guns start doggin'
And when the guns start talkin', One's not walkin
Let that go, Right now it's all about us

Going down like that, the real shit just don't come around like that

(What we gonna do is Rock that shit!)

[Verse 1]
If I begged and if I cried
Would it change the sky tonight?
Would it give me some light?
Should I wait for you to call?
Is there any hope at all?
Are you driftin' by?

[Chorus]
When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)

[Verse 2]
And when I lie all by myself
I see your face, I hear your voice
My heart stays faithful
And time has come and time has passed
If it's good, it's got to last
It feels so right

[Chorus]
When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You, you disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)

[Bridge]
I missed all the signs, one at a time
You were ready
What did I know?
Starting our lives
Now my love, I'm ready to show

[Chorus]
When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear
You disappear, you disappear
You disappear, disappear

[Verse 1]
Just because I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I'll stop
Doesn't mean I'm across
Just because I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserved
No better and no worse

[Chorus]
I just got lost
Every river that I tried to cross
Every door I ever tried was locked
Oh and I'm just waiting till the shine wears off

[Verse 2]
You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
Cause along may come
A bigger one

[Chorus]
And you'll be lost
Every river that you tried to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Oh and I'm just waiting till the firing stopped
Oh and I'm just waiting till the shine wears off

[Outro]
Oh and I'm just waiting till the shine wears off
Oh and I'm just waiting till the shine wears off
Oh and I'm just waiting till the shine wears off
Oh and I'm just waiting till the shine wears off

[Refrain]
Ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Don't you ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go
Couped in the 'Bach or the Rolls
If I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

[Verse 1]
Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gon' choke, oh?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You can't stay, you gotta go, oh
Ain't no other chick spending ya dough
This is taking a toll
The way the story unfolds
Not the picture-perfect movie everyone would've saw

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go
Couped in the 'Bach or the Rolls
If I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

[Refrain]
Ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Don't you ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

[Verse 2]
Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He's so arrogant and bold, oh
But she gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call
Partner, ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'ma cause

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go
Couped in the 'Bach or the Rolls
If I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

[Bridge]
How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it, babe?
Is that the price that I pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?
(See all the things, see all the things)

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go
Couped in the 'Bach or the Rolls
If I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

[Verse 1]
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through... again
My mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known

[Verse 2]
Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
"Run as fast as you can"

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games
When I loved you so?
I should've known

[Bridge]
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known

[Outro]
You should've known
Don't you think I was too young?
You should've known
MCA:
To the heart of the matter, the mic I shatter
So cold on the mic, I make your teeth chatter
You climb the corporate ladder
To make your pockets fatter
We be flipping styles like pancake batter

Mike D:
Looking through your binos, spying on me
I'm running like a rhino on a drinking spree
Call yourself an MC, but what's your truth?
You Gotta let it loose inside the toll booth

Ad-Rock:
Suckers sniffin' on socks, chewin' on rocks
My competition want the combination to the lock
You wanna get inside, well, then you best knock-knock
And when you get on, you got to rock nonstop

Beastie Boys:
Once it hits your mind, what'cha gonna do?
Don't keep it inside, you've got to

Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...

MCA:
Well, I can feel it in my bloodstream, see it in their eyes
People lining up for their own demise
To help the man make weapons to monetize
Corporate violence, we can't abide

Mike D:
You can keep your bottle service and your cabana
Bust your ass drunk like you slipped on a banana
Like knick-knack, patty whack, you've got to let it out
From the mind to the mic, to the word to a shout

Ad-Rock
Mind to the rhyme, paper to the pen
The brand new dance called the David Rodigan
You sure you really wanna let me begin
You can't stop me rhymin' when I'm on, I'm all in

Beastie Boys:
Life is good and then it gets you
Stuff you thought, it comes true
Once it hits your mind, what'cha gonna do?
Don't keep it inside, you've got to
SAY IT!
Let it out, let it out
SCREAM IT!
Gonna shout, gonna shout

[Verse 1]
Uh, uh, uh
Niggas gettin' trampled on, what's all the fuss about?
Suckin' my dick so hard, I'm bustin' in they mouth
And then I snuff 'em out, four to the mid', fuck what I did
With no regard for a bid, wet you up, while you with your kid
Slid into the shadows, 'cause I'm dark like that
I bark like that, jet black, but I spark like that
Where are they at, when I get thirsty, shit
Ain't a nigga strong enough to stand the worst it gets
Bits and pieces are all that's that left
Niggas so scared to death, they hold they motherfuckin' breath
'Til I pass, 'cause they ass, and I smelled em
I-S-P-E-L-L-E-D T-H-E-M, I spelled them
To make me have to swell one, eye up, lump up one head
Catch a body with the shottie, pump up one dead
Red alert, niggas is about to get hurt, do work
To skirts, like a jag on the murk, erf
Night time is the right time for creepin'
Vandalize your crib, rape your wife while she's sleepin'
I been off the deep end, since I was semen
That's why now, I'm such a motherfuckin' demon!
Screamin, my bloody head off, shit on my mind I gots to get off
Can't even hold a joint, lest I let off
A couple of rounds, from the big three pound, seven
That's about eleven hundred as of now
How can one man kill so many
Innocent people before the age of twenty
Life ain't worth a penny in, my book faggot
That's why I took faggot shit, I'm a crook faggot
Fat new leather jacket, I bag it
Along with the jewels smackin' tools out the hands of fools
On the strength that they don't know what they holdin'
Niggas called me Taylor cause the way that I be sewin'
Shit up 'cause I get up, off my ass and skate
Makin more moves than U-Haul, from state to state
I speak the great, and if a nigga tells you different
You turn around you ask the nigga, "The fuck is you be sniffin'?"
Cause when it come to riffin', I am the riff-raffin'
Gots to say nothin', niggas know they get had

[Outro]
Motherfucker, Funk Flex, volume three, the final chapter

[This]
Oh yeah
This is for the strippers, woah

[Verse 1]
She bad, niggas know that
Slim waist with a ass so fat
I'm in the club spendin' racks on racks
Gotta really cute smile and the tats on her back
She know what a nigga wan' do
Money up, fuck what you're goin' through
Doin' shit them other hoes won't do
Got the body of a goddess and it's all on you
Baby, show me what it is when you come around
I can take you to my crib, let me put it down
Lil mama got them eyes
I'ma do her right

[Chorus]
This is for the strippers, gon' head and tip her
Gon' head and tip her, gon' head and tip her
Came with ya niggas, gon' head and tip her
Gon' head and tip her, gon' head and tip her
Stripper, stripper music
Stripper, stripper music

[Verse 2]
She bad, I don't wanna touch her
Slow down, shawty, I don't wanna rush
Throwin' money in the club on the hush, baby
Bitch, I can get to know get to know ya
Let's go, let me show ya
Everythin' that I wanna do
You heard what i said
Your body would look dope in my bed
So baby, bring it back to my crib
And I promise, shawty, it can go down
We can go downtown 'cause baby, you know

[Chorus]
This is for the strippers, gon' head and tip her
Gon' head and tip her, gon' head and tip her
Came with ya niggas, gon' head and tip her
Gon' head and tip her, gon' head and tip her
Stripper, stripper music
Stripper, stripper music

[Outro]
Swavey, yeah

[Verse]
14 kicked out on my own
Ain't shit for a nigga in the world
'Cause when you in a single parent home
Money the motive and nigga you ain't thinkin' 'bout a girl
When the day turn dark and the night come
The pain cut deep and it might run
Try to hide it all and ya light somethin'
Hopin' that the feelin' there might numb
But it don't and it won't
Ever ever ever go the fuck away
When you livin' on the street for another day
Dead broke thinkin', "Man, it's gotta be another way"
Tryna get a job but it don't go
Tryna build money when it don't grow
Kinda feel funny when you don't got funds
And you tryna cop a crib, it's a no go
Find life gettin' all loco
And you're livin' all low pro
And you still need a roof-in
So you move in with three niggas that you don't know
A little spot downtown
In the city, life with a twist
You spendin' every night gettin' pissed
And you find the true meanin' of life is a bitch
Black male, black male
Young Canadian black male
Livin' in the motherfuckin' slum
I figured I would make crack sell
Too bad that didn't work
But bein' in the back didn't work
And music, it wasn't in the plans
I was like, "Yeah right, like that's getting heard"
I locked up, niggas started robbin'
I fucked up, niggas I was robbin'
Got fucked up for the niggas I was robbin'
Just some little fucked up niggas that was mobbin'
I tried to invest in a gun
Bad outcomes destined to come
Mom died, Dad cried
Dad tried to do the best for his son
Well send the things we're gone, pop
'Cause everything went wrong, pop
And even though I took the long way
I guess I really had to learn the hard way huh, pop
It beats me
But the hatin' ain't gon' grease me
So I roll the pain in these streets
'Cause it's way too hard to sleep sweet
This ain't an act nor a story
This a chapter of Tory
And what's after the story
Hand claps and the glory
That's when it got bad for me
So hows that for a story?
Not bad, but guess what
This ain't even half of my story

[Verse 1]
Cold is the water
It freezes your already cold mind
Already cold, cold mind
And death is at your doorstep
And it will steal your innocence
But it will not steal your substance

[Chorus]
But you are not alone in this
And you are not alone in this
As brothers we will stand and we'll hold your hand
Hold your hand

[Verse 2]
And you are the mother
The mother of your baby child
The one to whom you gave life
And you have your choices
And these are what make man great
His ladder to the stars

[Chorus]
But you are not alone in this
And you are not alone in this
As brothers we will stand and we'll hold your hand
Hold your hand

[Bridge]
And I will tell the night
Whisper, "Lose your sight"
But I can't move the mountains for you

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
See that's the good thing about my hair man...
All I do is put water in that shit so I pull a joint out and it don't be all greasy and oily..
Turn up..

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Your flow a dime-a-dozen, my flow you gotta love it
My city hot as fuck and, came from the bottom of it
But not a product of it, bitch all my rides are custom
Smoking my ganja public, I'm all about that money
Dress like everyday sunny
Rolling weed like a Marley, smile like everything funny
But this industry shady, most these niggas are crazy
Most of them quick to lose they soul, no if or a maybe
These nudies what I'm wearing, the truth is what you're hearing
The bong is what I'm clearing, the kush is overbearing
Ferrari's what I'm steering, I'm smoking while I'm driving
Keep looking in the mirror, make sure no ones behind us
Cause niggas get jealous when your bank start to swell up
So much that people at the bank start to tell us
You need to have somebody bank for you fellas

[Hook x2: Wiz Khalifa]
Look at me
Look at me
Look at me
Look at them and look at me

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I paint a perfect picture, a perfect portrait
Poverty, robbery kill or be killed psychology
I shine just me and my nine
Screw you niggas at 8 o'clock, sharp like it’s Columbine
Guess I'm one of a kind
I see you niggas soft when that shell hit your face
I'll hit your wake to flip your coffin
Bitch get to walkin', this Sabrina's orphan
I'm like the virus, the 38, the pop cyrus
Warriors are victorious
Come out to play, I mean right away
Shit’s Ferragamo, Emporio Armani drawers
Outlaw, a nigga break all kinda laws
It's hard bottom line, time money frozen time
AP, royal oak, kush smoke, bag the coke
Push the dope, cut throat, so what
I cut throat, I fuck with hoes
So I ain't gotta say it's time to go
She already know for sure when it's time to go

[Hook x2]
Look at me
Look at me
Look at me
Look at them and look at me

[Verse 1]
Serve God, love me and mend
This is not the end
Live unbruised, we are friends
And I'm sorry, I'm sorry

[Verse 2]
Sigh no more, no more
One foot in sea, one on shore
My heart was never pure
You know me, you know me

[Bridge]
But man is a giddy thing
Oh, man is a giddy thing
Oh, man is a giddy thing
Oh, man is a giddy thing

[Chorus]
Love, it will not betray you
Dismay or enslave you, it will set you free
Be more like the man you were made to be
There is a design, an alignment
A cry of my heart to see
The beauty of love as it was made to be

Love, it will not betray you
Dismay or enslave you, it will set you free
Be more like the man you were made to be

There is a design, an alignment
A cry of my heart to see
The beauty of love as it was made to be

Love, it will not betray you
Dismay or enslave you, it will set you free
Be more like the man you were made to be

There is a design, an alignment
A cry of my heart to see
The beauty of love as it was made to be
As the winter winds litter London with lonely hearts
Oh the warmth in your eyes swept me into your arms
Was it love or fear of the cold that led us through the night?
For every kiss your beauty trumped my doubt

[Chorus]
And my head told my heart
"Let love grow"
But my heart told my head
"This time no
This time no"

We'll be washed and buried one day my girl
And the time we were given will be left for the world
The flesh that lived and loved will be eaten by plague
So let the memories be good for those who stay

[Chorus]
And my head told my heart
"Let love grow"
But my heart told my head
"This time no"
Yes, my heart told my head
"This time no
This time no"
Oh the shame that sent me off from the God that I once loved
Was the same that sent me into your arms
Oh, and Pestilence is won when you are lost and I am gone
And no hope, no hope will overcome

And if your strife strikes at your sleep
Remember spring swaps snow for leaves
You'll be happy and wholesome again
When the city clears and sun ascends

[Chorus]
And my head told my heart
"Let love grow"
But my heart told my head
"This time no"

[Chorus]
And my head told my heart
"Let love grow"
But my heart told my head
"This time no
This time no"

[Verse 1]
Roll away your stone, I'll roll away mine
And together we can see what we will find
Don't leave me alone at this time
For I am afraid of what I will discover inside

[Verse 2]
See you told me that I would find a hole
Within the fragile substance of my soul
And I have filled this void with things unreal
And all the while my character it steals

[Chorus]
"Darkness" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I seek

[Verse 3]
It seems that all my bridges have been burned
But, you say that's exactly how this grace thing works
It's not the long walk home
That will change this heart
But the welcome I receive with the restart

[Chorus]
"Darkness" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I seek
"Darkness" is a harsh term, don't you think?
And yet it dominates the things I seek

[Bridge]
Stars, hide your fires!
These here are my desires
And I will give them up to you this time around
And so, I'll be found
With my stake stuck in this ground
Marking its territory of this newly impassioned soul
Hide your fires!
These here are my desires
And I will give them up to you this time around
And so, I'll be found
With my stake stuck in this ground
Marking its territory of this newly impassioned soul

[Outro]
But you, you've gone too far this time
You have neither reason nor rhyme
With which to take this soul that is so rightfully mine

[Spoken outro]

[Verse 1]
The nickel dropped when I was on
My way beyond the rubicon
What did I do?
And of the games that I can handle
None are ones worth the candle
What should I do?
I'm a frightened, fickle person
Fighting, cryin', kickin', cursin'
What should I do?

[Chorus]
Oooh, after all the folderol
And hauling over coals stops
What will I do?

[Verse 2]
Can't take a good day without a bad one
Don't feel just to smile until I've had one
Where did I learn?
I make a fuss about a little thing
The rhyme is losing to the riddling
Where's the turn?
I don't want a home, I'd ruin that
Home is where my habits have a habitat
Why give it a turn?

[Chorus]
Oooh, after all the folderol
And hauling over coals stops
What did I learn?

[Bridge]
I am likely to miss the main event
If I stop to cry or complain again
So I will keep a deliberate pace
Let the damned breeze dry my face

[Breakdown]
Ooooh mister wait until you see
What I'm gonna be

[Verse 3]
I've got a plan, a demand and it just began
And if you're right, you'll agree
Here's coming a better version of me

[Outro]
Here it comes, a better version of me
Here it comes, a better version of me

[Verse 1]
I'm undecided about you again
Mightn't be right that you're not here
It's double-sided cause I ruined it all
But also saved myself
By never believing you, Dear

[Verse 2]
Everything good I deem too good to be true
Everything else is just a bore
Everything I have to look forward to
Has a pretty painful and very imposing before

[Chorus]
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then lettin' it go by the boards
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then lettin' it go by the boards

[Verse 3]
I have too been playing with fifty-two cards
Just cause I play so far from my vest
Whatever I've got, I've got no reason to guard
What could I do but spend my best

[Chorus]
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then lettin' it go by the boards
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then lettin' it go by the boards

[Bridge]
And after waiting, fighting patiently on my knees
All the other stuff tired itself out first, not me
And in its wake appeared the touch and call of a different breed
One who set to get me wise and got me there and then, got me

[Verse 4]
And what a thing to know what could be instead
Oh what a blessed curse to see
It took the agenda from its place in my bed
Made a merry paramour of me

[Modified Chorus]
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then lettin' it go by the boards
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Giving me eyes to view it
As it goes by the boards

[Chorus]
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then lettin' it go by the boards
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then lettin' it go by the boards

[Modified Chorus]
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Giving me eyes to view it
As it goes by the boards
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Giving me eyes to view it
As it goes by the boards

[Verse 1]
I've fallen from grace, I've made mistakes, wondering
Wishing that I could just change the past, babe
One day, my love could change again
I can't, leaping, oh, my parachute opening up
So I'm leaping off the ledge with no pressure

[Pre-Chorus]
Like an acrobat or a fighter jet
I'll just soar through the air 'cause I'm so fearless
When I reach my mark, hope that it's your heart
At the end, it's all worth it

[Chorus]
Just so I scream geronimo
Girl, the clouds are blinding my eyes from free falling
Geronimo
No more holding back, finally letting go
I'm gonna show you I ain't scared to jump
And you don't even seem that far away
Yeah, yeah, I'll base jump, base jump
For your love

[Verse 2]
Up in the rain, as I'm falling through the storm
And the lightning's in my face, girl, you're beautiful
Oh what a day 'cause girl, it ain't the usual
And the sky is bright now
And I can feel it 'cause I'm getting closer
And no one else gave me a chance to fly
Feels like I'm in outer space
And your gravity's pulling me down right now

[Pre-Chorus]
Like an acrobat or a fighter jet
I'll just soar through the air 'cause I'm so fearless (Yeah)
When I reach my mark, hope that it's your heart
At the end, it's all worth it

[Chorus]
Just so I scream geronimo
Girl, the clouds are blinding my eyes from free falling (Oh yeah, I'm free falling)
Geronimo
No more holding back, finally letting go
I'm gonna show you (Show you) I ain't scared to jump
And you don't even seem that far away (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah (Hey), I'll base jump, base jump
For your love

[Bridge]
Base jump, base jump
I'll base jump, base jump, yeah
Base jump, base jump for your love
Oh, your love

[Chorus]
Geronimo
Girl, the clouds are blinding my eyes from free falling (Oh)
Geronimo
No more holding back, finally letting go
I'm gonna show you I ain't scared to jump
And you don't even seem that far away
Yeah, yeah, I'll base jump, base jump
For your love

[Outro]
I'll base jump, base jump
For your love
I'll base jump, base jump
For your love
I'll base jump, base jump
For your love

K-Mac, K-Mac

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Sweetheart, when the sunlight's on your face now
Hope that faith can have its way today
Sweetheart, it's like I'm drifting on the stars
Know you're in a rush and my love's on the way-ay-ay-ay

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, with Kevin McCall]
And I love that you are everything I want (Oh-oh)
And if you need anything from me, you can just ask me
'Cause your touch does something to me, baby (Oh-oh)
'Cause you're my greatest gift, I seal it with a kiss
And I just wanna tell you that you are...

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
A sweetheart is what you are (Girl, a sweetheart, sweetheart)
I said a sweetheart is what you are, you are wonderful
A sweetheart is what you are (Oh-na-na, oh-na-na)
Sweetheart, sweetheart

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
If I could take all the girls around the world and put them in a room, oh-whoa
None of them could compare to you, oh-whoa
And I put together all the pieces
Only thing that's missing is you, yeah, is you, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, with Kevin McCall]
And I love that you are everything I want (Oh-oh)
And if you need anything from me, you can just ask me
'Cause your touch does something to me, baby (Oh-oh)
'Cause you're my greatest gift, I seal it with a kiss
And I just wanna tell you that you are...

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
A sweetheart is what you are (Girl, a sweetheart, sweetheart, hey, hey, yeah)
I said a sweetheart is what you are, and you are wonderful
A sweetheart is what you are (Yeah, oh-na-na, oh-na-na)
Sweetheart, sweetheart

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
Wind in your hair and the scent of your perfume, girl
Nothing compares to you, to you, babe
Found paradise, you look so good in my eyes
It's not a mirage right in front of me
You're not, you're not, you are the real thing
Hands up (Hands up), for your love (For your love)
If you really, really love somebody, body
Hands up (Hands up), for your love (For your love)
If you really, really love somebody, body
I said put your hands up, for your love
If you really, really love somebody, body (Ayy)
And I can see there's more to what you are, girl
Baby, you are

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
A sweetheart is what you are (Girl, a sweetheart, sweetheart)
I said a sweetheart is what you are, and you are wonderful
A sweetheart is what you are (Oh-na-na, oh-na-na)
Sweetheart, sweetheart

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Wind in your hair and the scent of your perfume, girl
Nothing compares to you, to you, babe
Found paradise, you look so good in my eyes
It's not a mirage right in front of me
You are the real thing
My top down, my money long
My bitch bad and I’m packed up
Niggas like me these bitches fuck

Straight linen like dope money
Got a red bitch and a red Rrari
If something comes, California
She mink skinned, her butter milk

Get the club, that Rollie watchin’
New Versace chain, they can’t stand me
Heated up in the club and we poppin’ these bitches
And we bumpin’ in designer, we rockin’, we on
We on, 20 racks and we shoppin’
8 million and it’s droppin’
If you want it give me coppin’
Bitch, I’m tripped up like a light switch

Good round with that black truck
But don’t steer back that white shit
Money, it’s the root of all evil

Couple ounces for these sreets, I’m on

Been getting all this money and fuckin’ all these bitches
Survive all these hoods, bumpin, we bumpin’ these bitches

Cute face, big ole ass

Diamonds on my back, diamonds on my wrist
Might splurge a lil bit and put diamonds on this bitch

[Intro: Freddie King]
Love is nice when it’s understood
Even nicer when it makes you feel good
You got me trippin’ why our love is old
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
It’s like Woodstock city, brand new feelin’
Bob to the music, suck it than I visit
My heart beat acoustic, moves like Hendrix
Walk through a fire, then I flame and kiss it
Go hard in my Lambo, strikes and a blizzard
Two million in the frame, gotta roll with the vision
Vision of a good time, all they wanna know
When the party gon’ start, let the good times roll
Come on, let’s go, you got a lot of living
Get the party on the road, ain’t nothing like the feeling
When you’re winning in your soul
The wheel keep spinning, only got one road
Stop, stop the show, and stop, stop the flow
The world ain’t ready 'cause I rock the globe
So act like you know, act like you know
Act like you know, just what to do
When the good times roll

[Chorus: Freddie King]
Love is nice when it’s understood
Even nicer when it makes you feel good
You got me trippin’ why our love is old
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Hey Flo, I got you!
Yeah, yeah
Take your, take your clothes off
Ride that bitch, I drove off
Highway to Heaven, I'll burn the bridge
Red bandana, blood, sweat and tears
Yeah, it’s Tunechi, bitch
With a capital crucifix, hahaha!
Let the good times roll like my weed
Tricks on my skateboard, and up my sleeves
YMCMB Truk everything else
So many whips, my garage got whelps
Now put your motherfuckin’ hands in the air
And my throne is an electric chair
Yeah!

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
And let’s go all night, all night
Wake up the club and let’s go all out, all out
More drinks for us, toast to the good times
May they last forever, we’re young, to the good times
Raise your glass, let’s all have some fun

[Chorus: Freddie King]
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll

[Outro: Freddie King]
Come on, baby, let the good times roll

[Verse 1]
Please, could you stop the noise?
I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices
In my head

[Chorus]
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but not an android)
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but not an android)

[Verse 2]
When I am king
You will be first against the wall
With your opinion
Which is of no consequence at all

[Chorus]
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but no android)
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but no android)

[Bridge 1]
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking, squealing, Gucci little piggy
You don't remember, you don't remember
Why don't you remember my name?
Off with his head, man, off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name?
I guess he does

[Bridge 2]
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
That's it, sir, you're leaving (Rain down)
The crackle of pigskin (Rain down)
The dust and the screaming (Come on, rain down)
The yuppies networking (On me)
The panic, the vomit (From a great height)
The panic, the vomit (From a great height)
God loves his children
God loves his children, yeah

[Verse 1]
At night they would go walking
'Til the breaking of the day
The morning is for sleeping
Through the dark streets they go searching
To see God in their own way
Save the night time for your weeping
Your weeping

[Chorus]
Singing la-la-la-la-la-la-lay
And the night over London lay

[Verse 2]
So we rode down to the river
Where Victorian ghosts pray
For their curses to be broken
We go wander 'neath the arches
Where the witches are and they say
"There are ghost towns in the ocean"
The ocean

[Chorus]
Singing la-la-la-la-la-la-lay
And the night over London lay

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
God is in the houses
And God is in my head
And all the cemeteries of London
I see God come in my garden
But I don’t know what he said
For my heart it wasn’t open
Not open

[Chorus]
Singing la-la-la-la-la-la-lay
And the night over London lay
Singing la-la-la-la-la-la-lay
There’s no light over London today

[Verse]
All winter, we got carried
Away over on the rooftops, let's get married
All summer, we just hurried
So come over, just be patient and don't worry
So come over, just be patient and don't worry
So come over, just be patient and don't worry
And don't worry

[Chorus]
No, I don't want a battle from beginning to end
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
I don't wanna follow Death and all of his friends
No, I don't want a battle from beginning to end
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
I don't wanna follow Death and all of his friends

[Verse]
And in the end
We lie awake
And we dream of making our escape
And in the end
We lie awake
And we dream of making our escape
Oooh...

[Verse 1]
If sweet death should ever conquer me
Let me know boys, let me know
If you hear him coming, won't you let me flee?
Let me go boys, let me go

[Verse 2]
One day death is going to conquer me
I’ll be down where the waters flow
I hope sweet heaven has a place for me
Let me know boys, let me know

[Verse 3]
If sweet death should ever conquer me
Take me down to some place below
If you hear him coming, won't you set me free?
Let me go boys, let me go

[Outro]
If you hear him coming, won't you sing for me?
That I just don’t want to go

[Verse 1]
Uh, you got your own list of problems
And really I can't do shit to solve 'em
Wanna hit a nigga up like, "Why you dissin'?"
Well this time, I ain't got time so girl, dismiss it
Kissin' on your neck, you be givin' that disrespect
Until I give you this dick up in your chest
And you hit me like, "Damn bae, damn bae
That shit feel so damn great"
Start confessin', you so weak
That you can't even stand straight
Start again, arguin', talkin' 'bout you can't stand me
Like I don't understand you and you don't understand me
Damn girl, my head hurt, need to stop that for your man's sake
And you walk up out that door and slap me like a hand shake, damn

[Chorus]
Girl, I've been thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you
Hopin' that you thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me
Just let me know, just let me know
Just let me know, just let me know

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you be comin' 'round with all that cussin'
We can have a conversation but damn, what's with all that fussin'?
What's worse is you used to call a nigga your husband
Guess I ain't that man no more
I guess I relly ain't in your plans no more
But damn you cold and damn you know
And damn you so and now you know
Make me wanna take my hands and oh
But I ain't gon' do that 'cause I ain't gon' do that
Say you gotta man well, I already knew that
Well I'll be in the new back 'cause I ain't takin' you back
Already been through that and I ain't tryna do that
Places I be racin' though with laces, I won't lace you though
Amazin' how a relationship can go from a yes to a blatant no , no
Well it's amazin' what the brain can know
'Cause the dumb motherfucker that'll stick around any longer is the same motherfucker you mistake me for, damn girl

[Chorus]
Girl, I've been thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you
Hopin' that you thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me
Just let me know, just let me know
Just let me know, just let me know
Oh let me know, let me know
Oh let me know, let me know
Oh let me know, let me know
Oh let me know, let me know
Just let me know
Baby girl, I'm thinkin' 'bout ya
Please don't leave me outchea
All alone
I can't leave you
I can't leave you alone
Girl, let me know, let me know
Oh girl, let me know, let me know
Oh, let me know, let me know
Oh, let me know, let me know, oh

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Okay, I'm Weezy, baby
And, I am from the south where we call our women 'Baby'
Hey, baby, hey, baby, all day I smoke, hey, hey, hey
I'm balling like fadeaway, three letter credit, AOK
Black car, black car, girl, I've got a black car
Can I buy some of your time and charge it to my black card
You can be my bitter sweet, shake that sugar and salt
Chain's full of asphalt, bullshit walks, cash talks
Car black, car big, car fast, Car- ter
Can I stick my pencil in your sharpner
Beat it up like it's a drum, call me Travis Barker
Tat, tat, tat, boom, boom, tat, tat, boom, boom, tat, tat

[Hook: Lloyd]
All I really want is for you to back it up
Go and back it up, back it up, put your weight on it
Because it's alright, do what you want to, make me believe you
Get it, shorty because it's the remix, baby, the remix, baby, the remix
So get, get, get it, shorty because it's the remix, baby

[Verse 2: Big Boi]

Go get his card and hit the mall
And buy whatever that you want and
He keep calling, keep ignoring
I'mma pick You Up and We Goin Bounce Like Spalding
Tight up balling Chicks like tila
Sidekicks * pics looking like vida
Pull Into the Max Just Look At my meter
Fallin' in love the minute I meet her
Groupies be trying to act like they divas
Till I eject them outta my beamer
Step to the side its lookin Like We The Same As A Sumo With a wife beater
Super tight koopa's right
Put a little player-ism In Your life
Cause I'm the type of grinch that you like
My money mean and ain't too polite
To play or to dance?
Naw, baby stop it
The right time to do it
See the top as it's poppin'
See the door when it's lockin'
Jaws will drop cause they watchin'
Candy Paint changing Huey's
Call it pop, lock, and drop it
Get it shawty (Pssh)

[Hook]

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Start my day up on the roof
There's nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl
New ice, new glass
New watch, good times babe
It's good times, yeah
She wash my back three times a day
This shower head feels so amazing
We'll both be high, the help don't stare
They just walk by, they must don't care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Oh, real love, I'm searching for a real love
Oh, real love

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Alright, close your eyes to what you can't imagine
We are the Xanny-gnashing
Caddy-smashing, bratty assy
He mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag
And used the shit for batting practice
Adamant and he thrashing
Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed
Panic and patch me up
Pappy done latch-keyed us
Toying with Raggy Anns and Mammy done had enough
Brash as fuck, breachin' all these aqueducts
Don't believe us
Treat us like we can't erupt, yup

[Alternate Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Polo sweats and Hermes blankets
Them label hoes be stealing my shit
And all they clothes revealing they tits
Pills, high enough to touch the rim in that bitch
We party in my living room
'Cause father is gone
And he left me this empire
That runs on its own
So all I got to do is whatever the fuck I want
All we ever do is whatever the fuck we want

[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
We end our day up on the roof
I say I'll jump, I never do
But when I'm drunk I act a fool
Talking 'bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm
She slaps my hand
It's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
The market's down like 60 stories
And some don't end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one, a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
Real love, ain't that something rare
I'm searching for a real love, talking 'bout real love
Real love, yeah
Real love
I'm searching for a real love
Talkin' 'bout a real love

[Verse 1]
(We're spendin' too much time alone)
Spendin' too much time alone
(And I just ran outta Trojans)
Horses gallop to her throne
(We're behaving like teenagers)
Yes, we're behaving like teenagers
(Making less than minimum wage)
Still inside our parents' homes
(No, I don't live in Denver)
No, I don't live in Denver
(I grew up in Sierra Leone)
And her pink skies will keep me warm

[Chorus]
Sierra Leone
Sierra Leone
Tid bits of intuition that I be gettin' abandon mission
(Sierra Leone)
Abandon mission, you must be kiddin', this shit feelin' different
Shit feelin' too good to me
Glistening, shimmerin' underneath the sunlight, the sunlight
(Sierra Leone)

[Verse 2]
And a new day will bring about the dawn
And a new day will bring another crying babe into the world
(Girl now)
Our daughter's reaching for your nipple 'cause it's time for her to eat (Reaching for ya)
Tonight I'll lay her in the cradle if it's time to go to sleep (Oh, go to sleep, oh, oh)
I'll sing a Lennon lullaby, she can have a pretty dream
Baby girl, if you knew what I know, knew what I know

[Outro]
Na, na na, na na, na...
Na, na na, na na, na...

[Verse 1]
The best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either
Livin' in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
The water's blue, swallow the pill
Keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevine, mango, peaches, and limes, the sweet life

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The sweet life, sweet life
Sweet life, sweet life
The sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
Sweet life, the sweet life
Sweetie pie

[Chorus]
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life

[Verse 2]
The best song wasn't the single
But you couldn't turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmitting the waves
You're catching that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave
But you're keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevines, mango, peaches, and lime, a sweet life

[Pre-Chorus 2]
A sweet life
A sweet life, yeah
A sweet life, a sweet life
A sweet life
Live and die in the life

[Chorus]
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born (Yeah)
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach?

[Bridge]
And the water is exactly what I wanted (Ah)
It's everything I thought it would be (Thought it would be)
But this neighborhood is gettin' trippier every day
The neighborhood is goin' ape shit crazy, ahh

[Chorus]
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life

[Skit: Rosie Watson]
Stop thinking of this as being money
It's just money, I'ma make more
No, no no no no no
Please decondition yourself
It's not just money
It's happiness
It's the difference between happy, being happy and sad
It's the difference between having a home and living on the streets
That's what it is, it's not just money
It's so much more than that
Right now it's the difference between you being able to go to a prom
And disappointing a girl
As I told you from the beginning, I don't have money
I have bills to pay, but that meant nothing to you
Absolutely nothing
Let's see, I have
Ooh yeah, I'ma make myself a hot link when I get home
It meant nothing to you
Saving my seven dollars

[Intro]
We once had things in common
Now the only thing we share is the refrigerator
Ice cold, baby, I told you, I'm ice cold (Ice cold!)
You out here flyin' high (High)
Go head, fly that thing!
High, high, yeah
But fly alone

[Verse 1]
You always smokin' in the house
What if my mother comes over?
You can't get up and get a job
'Cause this little hustle's getting you by
You're the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known

[Chorus]
I know what I was on
I had a Pilot Jones (What you know about it?)
She took me high (Oh, did she now?)
Then she took me home (We talkin' 'bout)
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones

[Verse 2]
Tonight she came stumblin' across my lawn again
I just don't know why I keep on tryin' to keep a grown woman sober
See there you go reachin' up your blouse
And no, I don't want a child
But I ain't been touched in a while
By the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known, ever known

[Chorus]
I know what I was on (Ever known)
I had a Pilot Jones (What you know about it?)
She took me high (Oh, did she now?)
Then she took me home (We talkin' 'bout)
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones

[Verse 3]
In the sky up above, the birds
I saw the sky like I never seen before
You thought I was above you
Above this in so many ways
But if I got a condo on a cloud
Then I guess you can stay at my place
I'ma get one
I need ya
Admit it
You're my Pilot Jones

[Produced by Malay and Om'Mas Keith]

[Verse 1]
You don't know how little you matter until you're all alone
In the middle of Arkansas with a little rock left in that glass dick
Used to date a blonde, you used to hit it raw
'Cause she was and you are madly involved, madly involved

[Hook]
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock, crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock, crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock

[Verse 2]
You're shuckin' and jivin', stealin' and robbin'
To get the fixing that you're itching for
Your family stopped inviting you to things
Won't let you hold their infant
You used to to get a little cut-up from time to time
But the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky

[Hook]
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and you broke your home
Crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock

[Bridge]
Crooked cop, dead cop
How much dope can you push to me?
Crooked cop, dead cop
No good for community
Fuckin' pig get shot, three hundred men will search for me
My brother get popped and don't no one hear the sound
Don't no one hear the rounds (Sound)
Don't no one hear the shells (Shells)

[Outro]
Don't no one hear a sound
Don't no one disturb the peace for riot
Don't no one disrupt nirvana
Don't no one wanna blow the high
Crack rock, crack rock, crack rock
How you feeling, girl?
How's the gutter doing?
Crack rock

[Verse 1]
Double D
Big full breasts on my baby
(Yo, we going to Florida)
Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been going to work
Boss ain't working you like this
He can't take care of you like this

[Chorus]
Now you're lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

[Verse 2]
Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
(There he goes, one of God's own prototypes)
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl
(Too weird to live, too rare to die)
No, I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
Nor have I ever, have I ever let you get caught?

[Chorus]
Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

[Bridge]
She's at a stove (Who)
Can't believe I got her out here cooking dope (Cooking dope)
I promise she'll be whipping meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothing wrong (Nothing wrong)
No, nothing wrong (Ain't nothing wrong) with a lie (Ooh)
Nothing wrong (Nothing wrong)
With another short plane ride (Ain't nothing wrong)
Through the sky (Up in the sky)
You and I (Just you and I)

[Chorus]
Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

[Outro]
Love lost, lost? Love, love
Love lost, lost? Love, love
Love lost, love love, love lost
Faith is the substance-
Manos arriba!-
Then the other channel on the-

[Verse 1]
Mosh pits and bare chest
Stage diving sky diver
Spray the crowd with cold water
Now it's mosh pits and wet tits
I think I need a cold shower
Cool waters
African girl speaks in English accent
Likes to fuck boys in bands
Likes to watch Westerns
And ride me without the hands
Show me her passport
She's on her own tour
But you're beautiful to me, ooh
Wave 'em high, girl, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me, oh
Live in the clouds
Wave 'em high, girl, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
Life in the clouds
Keep em high, y'all
Beautiful stars
In the sky

[Verse 2]
Monks in the mosh pit
Stage diving Dalai Lama
Feet covered in cut flowers
They mosh for enlightenment
Clean chakra, good karma, oh
One with the water
Indian girl sleeps above the temple
Planning a runaway, young at heart
You found a boyfriend
And now you wanna get away, get away
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, get away
And at sunset they're gonna try and get away, get away
Abhayamudra

[Bridge]
I never ask for much
But please keep up lover
We've got no choices left
The running's fast
Run, run, run, run
You're beautiful to me
Run, run, run, run, you'd better run
You mean so much to me
In my world, my world

[Verse 3]
We made it safely
Even with your father's army trailing us
We escaped him
Even with his archers' bows at our backs
What a great escape
But there's a long way still, in fact
We're lost in a jungle underneath these clouds
There's a monsoon that never ends
A coke white tiger woke us from our slumber
To guide and protect us ‘til the end

[Outro]
We're in the clouds
Wave 'em high now, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me, oh
Keep 'em high, y'all, show you right
But you're beautiful to me, oh (Right)
Beautiful

[Verse 1]
Taxi driver
Be my shrink for the hour
Leave the meter running
It's rush hour
So take the streets if you wanna
Just outrun the demons, could you?

[Chorus]
He said "Allahu akbar"
I told him, "Don't curse me"
"Bo Bo, you need prayer"
I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees, it's a bad religion, ooh
This unrequited love
To me, it's nothin' but a one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I can never make him love me
Never make him love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love

[Verse 2]
Taxi driver
I swear I've got three lives
Balanced on my head like steak knives
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise
I can't trust no one

[Chorus]
And you say "Allahu akbar"
I told him, "Don't curse me"
"Bo Bo, you need prayer"
I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees, it's a bad religion
Oh, unrequited love
To me, it's nothin' but a one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I can never make him love me
Never make him love me
No, no, ahh

[Outro]
It's a, it's a bad religion
To be in love with someone
Who could never love you
Oh-oh-oh, only bad, only bad religion
Could have me feeling the way I do

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
And the peaches and the mangos
That you could sell for me

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, "What is your woman?
Is she just a container for the child?"
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, ohh
Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God, she's giving me pleasure

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh, oh
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My God, giving me pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure over matter

[Verse 3: André 3000]
Hey, hey
Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, "Naw
She better with some fella with a regular job"
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe
Hopped into my car; drove far
Far's too close and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin
If models are made for modelin'
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter

[Outro: André 3000]
You're good at being bad, you're bad at being good
For heaven's sakes, go to hell, nah, knock on wood, hey
You're good at being bad (You're bad at being good)
For heaven's sakes, go to hell
For heaven's sakes, go to hell
Knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
Well, frankly, when that ocean so mu'fucking good
Make her swab the mu'fucking wood
Make her walk the mu'fucking plank
Make her rob a mu'fucking bank
With no mask on and a rusty revolver

[Intro]
I wanna see your pom poms from the stands
Come on, come on

[Chorus]
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind, boy
Running on my mind, boy
Forrest Gump

[Verse 1]
I know you, Forrest
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
But you're so buff and so strong
I'm nervous, Forrest
Forrest Gump

[Chorus]
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind, boy
Running on my mind, boy
Forrest Gump

[Verse 2]
I saw your game, Forrest
I was screaming, "Run forty-four!"
But you kept running past the end zone
Oh, where'd you go, Forrest?
Forrest Gump

[Chorus]
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind, boy
Running on my mind, boy
Forrest Gump

[Outro]
Forrest green, Forrest blues
I'm remembering you
If this is love, I know it's true
I won't forget you
(You, you, oh, you, you)
It's for you, Forrest
(You, you, oh, you, you)
It's for you, Forrest
Forrest Gump

[Part I: End]

[Verse: Frank Ocean]
Darker times
They're telling boulder heavy lies
Looks like all we've got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn't compromise
She could recognize
Voodoo
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
Voodoo
Don't let him see divide
Don't you let her see divide
Voodoo
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
He's got the whole wide world in his hands

[Outro]
There's somethin' about you
I can't believe I'm even talking to you, tellin' you this right now
You're special
I wish you could see what I see

[Part II: Golden Girl]

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
She peels an orange for us in the morning
She woke me up to give me half
I can hear the children soccer ballin'
Like wildcats running on the grass, hey
You're a girl on this island
I'm a boy from America
My flight leaves tonight
But I don't think I'm going backwards
I won't be going backwards

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24K
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24K (Girl)
But the sky's never grey (Never grey)

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Silent moments, meditative poses
You break my focus, you make me laugh
Two mopeds racing through the forest
Making dirt clouds on a path, on a path
I'm my best on this island
I'm a mess in America
My flight left last night
But I know I'm not going back home, yeah
I'm not going back home, no

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24K
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24K (Girl)
But the sky's never grey (Never grey)

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
If we build a house in paradise, will we get to heaven still?
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes)
If we don't have to live through hell just to get to heaven
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes, breezes)
I'ma stay right here, with you
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes, breezes)
'Til the hurricane comes, 'til the tsunami comes
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes)
I've found my gold

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24K
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24K (Girl)
But the sky's never grey (Never grey)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Um, you're my G-O L-D E-N G-I R-L
And that's for the females that can't spell, but
Um, thanks for fuckin' with me
You turn my dark into light, you're like a bucket of bleach
You see, I want you to know that
My negatives at home aren't working for my Kodak
So that means that I don't want to go back
Just know that I would like to stay here and hold that
Hand of yours, girl, I'm a wreck in America
Your face is the best
'Cause it's the same color as the lace on my neck
And you're golden, uh, your eyes open, fuck it
Let's toast and listen to Michael Bolton
I free-fall off the hill again
Let's see where I land, I'm like Gilligan
Um, I trust you, Golden, for wed ring
I'm just hopin' that you don't turn my neck green

[Outro]

[Intro]
I know it’s hard but, you know
Let’s go

[Verse 1]
There’s something different in your eyes baby
You can’t seem to look into mine lately
Tell me what is on your mind baby
Or I'm gon' assume that something’s wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed
'Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived
And I'm not really tripping, I just can’t do this again
Please don’t tell me you’re just like them

[Chorus]
Please don’t tell me you’re just like them
You’re just like them

[Verse 2]
I know that it’s hard to trust love
But you need the trust that my love
Will never leave you in the dust

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed
Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived
And I'm not barely tripping I just can’t do this again
Please don’t tell me you’re just like them

[Chorus]
Please don’t tell me you’re just like them
You’re just like them

[Bridge]
Baby can we keep this love on track?
We can run away baby girl and we don't have to look back
You know that I love you girl so tell me what you’re waiting for?
You gotta know know know know
Know know know know know know
Know know know know know know

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed
Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived
And I'm not barely tripping I just can’t do this again
Please don’t tell me you’re just like them

[Chorus]
Please don’t tell me you’re just like them
You’re just like them

[Part I]

[Intro]
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody sit yo bitch-ass down
And listen to this true mothafuckin' story
Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch

[Chorus]
Smokin' on the finest dope, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Drank until I can't no mo', ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't askin' for no favors
Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Really, I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And Momma used to say (Say, say, say, say)
One day it's gon' burn you out (Woo)
One day it's gon' burn you out, out, out
One day it's gon' burn you out (You, you, you, you, you, you)
One day it's gon' burn you
But I'm with the homies right now

[Part II]

[Verse 1]
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, an orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate
If it's necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted
Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they workin' with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Rémy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga!
Me and the homies
Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
Me and the homies
I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in
Me and the homies
Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka
And be like "doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!”

[Verse 2]
It's 2:30 and the sun is beamin'
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin'
Hungry for anything unhealthy
And if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin'
We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester
You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses
Good Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there
'Cause every time we down there
We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like
Then started interrogatin'
I never was a gangbanger, I mean
I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic, 'cause I've never been violent
Until I'm with the homies

[Chorus 2]
(Just ridin', just ridin')
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin')

[Verse 3]
Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playin'
And our attitude is still "nigga, what is you sayin'?"
Pull in front of the house
That we been campin' out for like two months
The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want

[Break]
Ayy, ayy, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe!
Ayy, nigga, I think there's somebody in this room!
Wait, what?!
Nigga, there's somebody in this room!

[Verse 4]
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVD's, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circlin' life
My mama called: "Hello? What you doin'?" — "Kickin' it."
I shoulda told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense
With the homies
(Police sirens)
But – they made a right, then made a left
Then made a right, then another right
One lucky night with the homies

[Outro]
K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded
I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well, which one he talkin' about?
I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans!
Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga?
"Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!"
Yeah, yeah, that shit right there
I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan, luv
We gon' use the kickback as an alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park
'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
That's what he's not gon' do
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight, but we should meet up around 12
I'm tryna fuck on somethin' too
Nigga, sit yo dumb-ass back down!
Nigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight!
Matter of fact, nigga, get in the mothafuckin' car!
We finna get active!

[Produced by Tabu]
Yeah, its drizzy baby
Ah Ha uhh I’m ready, alright J fresh I got 'em

Look, I’m really the heir to the fortune of a millionaire
Talking money with me is really unfair
At the border like, "I swear, I have nothing to declare
I am nothing like these other niggas coming out this year"
Even if you never met me you can tell I’m on the same shit
Loyal as a mother fucker nobody be saying shit
Dope boys know me cause I often speak they language
So well spoken man I should have went to Cambridge
Y-o-u-n-g ho, women they can be so
Motivated by money that’s why they be on me for
Ask your favorite rapper homie guarantee that he know
If he is the one I’m the zero, (pshh damn)
Please comprehend I am a Surf Club general
I’m Mr. consistent I have never come in intervals
You don’t want be caught in the middle like a center fold
I'm committing suicide if we're ever identical
Click clack pow how you like a nigga now?
In control of my domain
They can do what I allow
And I know Toronto miss me I'mma be home in a minute
That's my city and I run it you just run around in it
They see me out in person and say I ain't heard you sing yet
The world is my playground dont fuck with my swingset
We get the pitching then that's when it gets to piling
I'm calling your bluff don’t act like you can’t see me dialing
I'm in, low cut Louis with them hard denim jeans an a beige jacket
Hands down the best in my age bracket
Holla at me

[Chorus]
Love me like you do, love me like you do
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go
What am I to do when you love me like you do?
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, baby, teach me, teach me, teach me
Show me, show me, show me the way to your heart
Ooh, my baby, baby, I'm begging, lady, lady
Put me in the middle, that's where I'mma start, uh huh

[Pre-Chorus]
I like how your eyes complementing you hair
The way that them jeans fit is making me stare
Promise, I'll be here forever, I swear
Our bodies touching while you

[Chorus]
Love me like you do, love me like you do
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go
What am I to do when you love me like you do?
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go

[Verse 2]
Baby, baby, baby, will let me, let me, let me
Let me, let me, let me, be all you your desire
Pretty baby, baby, I'm begging lady, lady
Take me to the top now and I'll take you higher

[Pre-Chorus]
I like how your eyes complementing you hair
The way that them jeans fit is making me stare
Promise, I'll be here forever, I swear
Kissing on your neck while you

[Chorus]
Love me like you do, love me like you do
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go
What am I to do when you love me like you do?
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go

[Bridge]
Alright, okay
Right there, my way
Cause when you love me, I can feel it
When your heart beats, I can hear it
Be quiet, don't say a word
Don't say nothing, girl, I'm all yours
Love me like you do but let me go first
Listen to these words right here

[Verse 3]
Love me like you do, love me like it's new
Love me like you love me, like there's nothing left to lose
We'll hop up in the Benz, if you're tryna cruise
Hop up in them bed, baby, if you're trying to snooze
Louis V. shoes, look at me do it
Got a lot of secrets, baby, can you guess clues?
And if you had a choice I know what'd you choose
You'd choose me, right?

[Chorus]
Love me like you do, love me like you do
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go
What am I to do when you love me like you do?
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go

[Intro: Wyclef Jean and Lil Wayne]
Some live for the bill
Some kill for the bill
She whine for the bill
Grind for the bill
(and she used to be the sweetest girl)
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay they bill
(and she used to be the sweetest girl)
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
High school, she was that girl
That make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
High school she was that girl
That make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
Never thought that she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)
She balls, he calls (where my money at?)
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
Closed legs don't get fed
Go out there and make my bread
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She ended up in the wrong car
Bruised up, scarred hard
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She balls, he calls (where my money at?)

[Hook: Akon]
See I'mma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)
See I'mma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean, Niia, Lil Wayne]
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money
It drives the world crazy
Weezy, she used to be…
And she used to be the sweetest girl!

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
But when a good girl gone, she gone forever
See, you can't make it rain without the stormy weather
And it's funny when it rains, when it rains it pours
Would've never happened if I would've stayed indoors
Would've never happened if I never traded in my textbooks
Cause now I'm hot but the critics say I'm just looks
They say I'm too sexy, they say I'm selling out
Cause when I come out niggas get their umbrellas out
I take the L 'cause I don't want to see my brother lose
Been through it all but I can never fill my mother's shoes
And now, I don't want a handout
I just want my ad-libs to get panned out
And I just wanna tell the girls that could feel me
That I just play the cards that a nigga deal me
See, everything I been through coulda killed me
That's why there really ain't nothing you could tell me
You see, I live for the bill, I die for the bill
And I still make sure I read the bi– to the –ble
And every time I write I'm precise in my skill
It's more to life than just ice in your grill
Fuck me, blame me, fuck you, pay me
This is what you made me (where my money at?)
Say you want to drape me, turned around and rape me
Now you ain't mistake me (where my money at?)

[Hook: Nicki Minaj}]
Where my girls at, where my girls at?
If they frontin' then tell them "yo, where my money at?"
Where my money at?
Where my-where my money at?
Whe-whe-whe-whe-whe- yo, where my money at?
Where my girls at, where my girls at? (oh, oh, hey, heyeah)
If they frontin' then tell them "yo, where my money at?" (where my money)
Where my money at? (oh, oh, oh)
Where my-where my money at?
Whe-whe-whe-whe-whe- yo, where my money at?

[B.o.B]
Dis shit, DEFINITELY ain't never gon' get released
Ha ha ha ha! Fuck it {DJ SCREAM}

[Hook: repeat 2X]
I'm just a nigga, just a nigga
That's what I am, that's what I am (that's what I am)
I'm just a nigga, a fucking nigga
Ask Uncle Sam, ask Uncle Sam

[B.o.B]
C'mon Bob, you can't say that! (C'mon)
Cause all the blacks'll get mad man, take it back (take it back)
You can say it every now and then in a rap (whassup my nigga?)
But even Amy Winehouse is goin "Back to Black" (ah-hah!)
See while every race is laughin at it
All the blacks is sittin 'round gettin mad at it (what should we do?)
Can white people say it? Uhh, they can have it
But see, I just got drunk and took a stab at it
See, everybody's awkward while I'm singin this
But, the truth is, everybody's thinkin this (damn right)
And if this song ever leaks on the internet
They'll be like, "Bob's actin real niggerish!" (Nigga!)

[Outro]
Ah ha! Ay man, you you really shouldn'ta done this song dawg
You shoulda done left that shit alone
Black people don't like when you be talkin 'bout nigga dawg
You need to just quit sayin that shit
Because if we quit sayin that shit, then, then
All black people will uh uh unite and get better
Yeah that what we need to do, we need to ban the N word
And when we ban the N word, everything gon' get better
Y'knahmsayin? So like you need to quit talkin 'bout that shit man
It really ain't cool
Everybody's really just lookin at you like a asshole
Y'knahmsayin? You-you shouldn'ta even done this shit man!
Why you doin this shit man? This shit ain't cool!
Niggas don't fuck with this shit man!
Tu-turn this song, man turn this shit off

[Verse 1]
Here's another speech you wish I'd swallow
Another cue for you to fold your ears
Another train of thought too hard to follow
Chuggin' along to a song that belongs to the shifting of gears

[Chorus]
Please forgive me for my distance
The pain is evident in my existence
Please forgive me for my distance
The shame is manifest in my resistance
To your love
To your love
To your love

[Verse 2]
I would've warned you, but really, what's the point?
Caution could but rarely ever helps
Don't be down, my demeanor tends to disappoint
It's hard enough even trying to be civil to myself

[Chorus]
Please forgive me for my distance
The pain is evident in my existence
Please forgive me for my distance
The shame is manifest in my resistance
To your love
To your love
To your love

[Bridge]
My derring-do allows me to
Dance the rigadoon around you
But by the time I'm close to you
I lose my desideratum and now you

[Verse 3]
So now you have it, so tell me baby, what's the word?
Am I your gal or should I get out of town?
I just need to be reassured
Do you just deal it out or can you deal with all that I lay down?

[Chorus]
Please forgive me for my distance
The pain is evident in my existence
Please forgive me for my distance
The shame is manifest in my resistance
To your love
To your love
To your love

[Outro]
To your love
To your love
To your love
To your love
To your love

Something isn't right and I don't wanna fight you

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey you, come over and let me embrace you
I know that I'm causing you pain too
But remember if you need to cry (Cry)

[Chorus]
I'm here to wipe your eyes
Tonight, before you fall asleep
I run my thumb across your cheek (Across your cheek)
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (Be okay)
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes

[Verse 2]
When did we cross the line? How could we could forget?
Why did we let the pressure get into our heads?
Your broken heart requires all of my attention
'Cause something isn't right, I don't wanna fight you

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey you, come over and let me embrace you
I know that I'm causing you pain too
But remember if you need to cry (Cry)

[Chorus]
I'm here to wipe your eyes
Tonight, before you fall asleep
I run my thumb across your cheek (Across your cheek)
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (Be okay)
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes

[Bridge]
Please don't lose your faith
Don't worry 'cause I'm here to keep you safe
I promise if you let me see your face
That I won't let you down, I won't let you down

[Chorus]
I'm here to wipe your eyes
Tonight, before you fall asleep
I run my thumb across your cheek (Across your cheek)
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (Be okay)
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes

[Verse 1]
Slow is the memory
And I can picture her standin' right in front of me
Said that I'm behaving badly
And kind of driving her crazy
But I know she wants me
I remember everything
Her sweat, it tastes like sugar cane
And sitting on top of me, yelling out my fucking name
Until I'm empty
But I know she wants me

[Chorus]
But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry, yeah
Sick of all these wasted years
Drowned in someone else’s tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry

[Break]
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
And I'll see you when I get back
Maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track
You touch me there because you know how much I like that
I think that we both need to relax, you know you want me
All the time and everywhere
A happy surface, but the underbelly isn't there
And the worst thing is that I don't even really care
And the emptiness is too much to bear

[Chorus]
But I, have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry
Sick of all these wasted years
Drowned in someone else's tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry

[Bridge]
'Cause sometimes I don't know what to do
I'm scared to stand right in front of you
The way our pain subsides
Can't bear the stare of your teary eyes
I know you feel like it's hard to stay
In fact, you may just wanna run away
Now all that I can really say is, baby, oh
Deep down you know, yeah

[Chorus]
I, have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry
Sick of all these wasted years
Drowned in someone else’s tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry
Already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry
Sick of all these wasted years
I’m drowned in someone else’s tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry

[Outro]
Oh, no, no, no, oh, no, no, no
Yeah, ooh, dry
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
You don't have to be beautiful
To turn me on
I just need your body, baby
From dusk till dawn
You don't need experience
To turn me out
You just leave it all up to me
I'm gonna show you what it's all about

[Chorus]
You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss
Oh yeah, alright, oh

[Verse 2]
You got to not talk dirty, baby
If you wanna impress me (Yeah)
You can't be too flirty, mama
And I know how to undress me (Yeah)
I want to be your fantasy
And maybe you could be mine
You just leave it all up to me
And we could have a good time

[Chorus]
You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss
Woo-hoo, hey, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh, oh

[Verse 3]
Women, not girls, they rule my world
I said they rule my world, yeah
Oh, act your age, not your shoe size (Not your shoe size)
And I could show you how to do the twirl
You don't have to watch Dynasty
To have an attitude
Just leave it all up to me
My love will be your fool

[Chorus]
You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your, ooh, kiss

[Outro]
Oh yeah
Oh oh
Alright, hey hey hey hey (Hey hey hey hey)
Hey hey hey hey (Hey hey hey hey )
Hey hey hey hey (Hey hey hey hey)
Woo, woo!

[Verse 1]
Hold me closer one more time
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters but you pushed me in
I've seen your face under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart more than I do
We were the greatest, me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
But we had time against us and miles between us
The heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

[Chorus]
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different, I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different, I'll be better to you

[Verse 2]
Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your walls around me and pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then but now I'm willing to learn

[Pre-Chorus]
But we had time against us and miles between us
The heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

[Chorus]
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different, I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different, I'll be better to you

[Bridge]
Time against us (Time against us), miles between us (Miles between us)
Heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
Time against us (Time against us), miles between us (Miles between us)
Heavens cried, I know I left you speechless
I know I left you speechless
I'll be waiting

[Chorus]
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different, I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different, I'll be better to you

[Verse 1]
I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true
I fall short each time, every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer, closer and near
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all
Like a bomb before explosion, ticking by your call
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed
And I'm just a child who longs on her knees

[Chorus]
But I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you

[Verse 2]
So you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper, "Will you leave your man?"
'Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me
I won't stand by you

[Chorus]
'Cause I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now that I don't need you

[Bridge]
I ain't yours for no taking
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes
And settle for wrong and ignore the right

[Chorus]
When I found a boy who loves me more
Than you ever did before
So stand beside the river you cried
And lay yourself down
Look how you want me now, but I don't need you

[Verse 1]
Never would've hitchhiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've run through the blindin' rain
Without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

Never would've seen the trouble that I'm in
If it hadn't been for love
Would've been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

[Hook]
Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul

[Verse 2]
Never would've gone to that side of town
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've took a mind to track him down
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've loaded up a forty-four
And put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

[Hook]
Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul

[Verse 3]
Never would've hitchhiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
Never would've loaded up a forty-four
Put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

[Outro]
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been
If it hadn't been for love

[Verse 1]
This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
Who blew me away, blew me away
And It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, buried them away

[Chorus]
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away

[Verse 2]
Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watched you wave and watched you wave
Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home, I call that home

[Chorus]
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away

[Verse 3]
Woke up feeling heavyhearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, it's calling me home

[Chorus]
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can spend my whole life hiding my heart away

[Verse 1: Adele]
Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone 'cause
I can't fight it anymore

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

[Chorus: Both]
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

[Verse 2: Darius Rucker]
Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop looking at the door, yeah
Wishing you'd come sweeping
In the way you did before

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

[Chorus: Both]
It's a quarter after one, I'm little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now

[Bridge: Both]
Yes, I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all

[Chorus: Both]
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call, but I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

[Outro: Both]
I just need you now
Oh, I need you now
Oh baby, I need you now
I just need you now

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?
Mother, do you think they'll like this song?
Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?
Ooh-ah, Mother, should I build the wall?

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
Mother, should I run for president?
Mother, should I trust the government?
Mother, will they put me in the firing line?
Ooh-ah, is it just a waste of time?

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mamma's gonna make all of your nightmares come true
Mamma's gonna put all of her fears into you
Mamma's gonna keep you right here, under her wing
She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing
Mamma's gonna keep baby cosy and warm

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh babe
Of course, Mamma's gonna help build the wall

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
Mother, do you think she's good enough... For me?
Mother, do you think she's dangerous... To me?
Mother, will she tear your little boy apart?
Ooh-ah, Mother, will she break my heart?

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mamma's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you
Mamma won't let anyone dirty get through
Mamma's gonna wait up until you get in
Mamma will always find out where you've been
Mamma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh babe
You'll always be "baby" to me

[Outro: Roger Waters]
Mother, did it need to be so high?
Come on all you pretty women
With your hair a-hanging down
Open up your windows 'cause
The Candyman's in town

Come on, boys, and gamble
Roll those laughing bones
Seven come eleven, boys
I'll take your money home

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
Till the Candyman comes 'round again

I come in from Memphis
Where I learned to talk the jive
When I get back to Memphis
Be one less man alive
Good mornin', Mr. Benson
I see you're doing well
If I had me a shotgun
I'd blow you straight to hell

Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
Till the Candyman comes 'round again

Come on, boys, and wager
If you have got the mind
If you got a dollar, boys
Lay it on the line

Hand me my old guitar
Pass the whiskey 'round
Won't you tell everybody you meet that
The Candyman's in town

Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
Till the Candyman comes 'round again

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, I say, bitch bad
Woman good, lady better
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Now imagine there's a shorty, maybe five, maybe four
Riding 'round with his mama listening to the radio
And a song comes on and a not far off from being born
Doesn't know the difference between right and wrong
Now, I ain't trying to make it too complex
But let's just say shorty has an undeveloped context
About the perception of women these days
His mama sings along, and this what she says
"Niggas, I'm a bad bitch, and I'm bad, bitch!
Somethin' that's far above average."
And maybe other rhyming words like "cabbage" and "savage"
And "baby carriage" and other things that match it
Couple of things are happenin' here
First he's relatin' the word bitch with his mama, comma
And because she's relatin' to herself
As most important source of help
And mental health, he may skew respect for dishonor

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
Uh, tell 'em, bitch bad
Woman good, lady better
They misunderstood
They misunderstood

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, now imagine a group of little girls nine through 12
On the Internet watching videos, listening to songs by themselves
It doesn't really matter if they have parental clearance
They understand the Internet better than their parents
Now, being the Internet, the content's probably uncensored
They're young, so they're malleable and probably unmentored
A complicated combination, maybe with no relevance
Until that intelligence meets their favorite singer's preference
"Bad bitches, bad bitches, bad bitches
That's all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches, bad bitches."
Now, let's say that they less concerned with him
And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
Ah, the plot thickens: high heels, long hair, fat booty, slim
Reality check, I'm not trippin'
They don't see a paid actress, just what makes a bad bitch

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Disclaimer: this rhymer, Lupe, is not using "bitch" as a lesson
But as a psychological weapon
To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions
Discretions, reflections, it's clever misdirection
‘Cause while I was rappin' they was growin' up fast
Nobody stepped in to ever slow 'em up, gasp
Sho' enough, in this little world
The little boy meets one of those little girls
And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
He thinks disrespectfully, she thinks of that sexually
She got the wrong idea, he don't wanna fuck her
He think she's bad at being a bitch like his mother
Momma never dressed like that
Come out the house, hot mess like that
Ass, titties, dressed like that, all out to impress like that
Just like that, you see the fruit of the confusion
He caught in a reality, she caught in an illusion
"Bad" mean good to her, she really nice and smart
But "bad" mean bad to him, "bitch" don't play a part
But "bitch" still bad to her if you say it the wrong way
But she think she a bitch – what a double entendre!

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Tell 'em, bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
They misunderstood

[Outro: MDMA]
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, they misunderstood
You're misunderstood
(I'm killin' these bitches)
Bitch bad, woman good
Lady better, greatest motherhood
(I'm killin' these bitches)

[Verse 1]
If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung
Would you hear my voice come through the music?
Would you hold it near as it were your own?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken
Perhaps they're better left unsung
I don't know, don't really care
Let there be songs to fill the air

[Chorus]
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow

[Verse 2]
Reach out your hand, if your cup be empty
If your cup is full, may it be again
Let it be known there is a fountain
That was not made by the hands of men

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There is a road, no simple highway
Between the dawn and the dark of night
And if you go, no one may follow
That path is for your steps alone

[Chorus]
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow

[Verse 3]
You who choose to lead must follow
But if you fall you fall alone
If you should stand then who's to guide you?
If I knew the way I would take you home

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Yea, we party ‘til the sun up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
We got that extra life, nigga one up

[Verse 1: Steve G Lover]
Fuck the recession, I’ma keep this thing going
If you ain’t know 'em, bet you probably still work for ‘em
Chick from Bermuda, that’s right I get my work foreign
They don’t get paid, I got hard dick and purp for 'em
Niggas out of line, get a shovel in the dirt for ‘em
Niggas wanna move, get the trucks and the shirt for ‘em
OG status, my job’s got perks for ‘em
Money, clothes, hoes, you ain’t ever gotta search for ‘em
You know what I’m doing, nigga I’ma do things
Getting to the money, I guess I got a few things
Fifteen nines, five dimes, only two chains
Smoke like Jamaicans, run it like I’m Usain
Fresh from the haircut down to the shoestrings
Hoes talk about me, I’ma need a new name
Steve G the prince, I’m looking like the new king
All I do is win so who the hell’s losing (What up)

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Yea, we party ‘til the sun up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
We got that extra life, nigga one up
Yea, we party ‘til the sun up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
We got that extra life, nigga one up

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Bino what the dealy, I heard that flow was silly
I heard you was so east side and that pussy's your Achilles
But really it’s time to get up, smoking on that get up
Bino lay it down and work it out like a sit up
I’m feeling like a winner, my living be so easy
My old girl look Leona, my new girl look Yukimi
So illy, I got espressos, mi mami give me besos
Shades on my face, Armani helping me lay low
D-Money get his name, these other niggas lame
These niggas used to hate me, I guess ain’t nothing changed
Shotgun in the Porsche, she don’t know where we going
American Royalty on that yolo Ralph Lauren
It’s that city where Luda be, stunting was new to me
But now we killing paper, fuck it I might just shoot a G
Leave your face open like you Breezy, I mean it
Nobody need to see nobody leaking, believe me

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Yea, we party ‘til the sun up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
We got that extra life, nigga one up
Yea, we party ‘til the sun up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
You ain’t liking what we doing – shut up
We got that extra life, nigga one up

[Hook]
I gotta grind, won't stop, hustle won't quit
Shine like no other, I be on some other shit
I got a high price lifestyle, super bad bitch
If I want it, bet I got it
If I don't then all I gotta do is
Go, get it, stay about my business
Ball till I fall, floss until I'm finished
I just go, get it, stay about my business
I'm living just to kill it, stacking millions to the ceiling

[Verse 1]
Every day above ground, all I wanna do is ball
Put my money over bitches, put my hustle over all
Louis down to the drawers, Louis Vuitton kicks
Got a Mad Hatter swagger, bitch I’m stupid dumb sick
With a group of young bitches and they're stupid dumb thick
I’m the marathon man, all I do is run shit
A sophisticated convict, superficial, still official
Multi-million dollar shit, money is the object
Hot shit, bitch, I got a sauna on my arm
Six figure with no diamond, Richard Mille and Vacheron
They just talk about they got it
I’m the upper echelon, though
Bitch, I‘m 'bout that action, you could go on with that convo
I have done more than you dream 'bout
Got your dream bitch and your dream house
On lean passing them beans out
With a bad crew, the whole team high
Go on boy, get seen by

[Pre-Chorus]
Bruh you know me, you know who I be
Stacking that dough, that’s all I see
I G-O G-E-T I-T

[Hook]
I gotta grind, won't stop, hustle won't quit
Shine like no other, I be on some other shit
I got a high price lifestyle, super bad bitch
If I want it, bet I got it
If I don't then all I gotta do is
Go, get It - stay about my business
Ball til I fall, floss until I'm finished
I just go, Get It - Stay about my business
I'm living just to kill it, stacking millions to the ceiling

[Verse 2]
I live life, fuck late night
Get shitfaced when I take flight
I get paid, no sick days
My outfit’s on switch blade
Don’t sniff yay, but I blow dro'
Bank roll on loco
Still ride with that fo'-fo'
Don’t let my P-O know
Bad white bitch super thick
I’m Ice T, she Coco
She got another bitch, them other bitches
Her ass fat, face so-so, no paper trail
No phone call, no emails, no photos
Just backshot, with that fat butt
And low blow headbutts in slow-mo
A Purple label, Polo and Akoo, that’s all I do
Man I Striver Row my denim in my new Margiela shoes
Man, we be cool if we just parle, on Margharita Molly
And the strongest pack around bumpin' Sade out in Maui
We menagin’ for a hobby
We kick it how we kick it
Know you envy how I’m living
Chicks just can’t resist this pimping
Get the million 'bout my business

[Pre-Chorus]
Bruh you know me, you know who I be
Stacking that dough that’s all I see
I G-O G-E-T I-T

[Hook]
I gotta grind, won't stop, hustle won't quit

I'm living just to kill it, stacking millions to the ceiling

[Intro]
Oh oh ohh-oh-oh, oh oh ohh-oh-oh
Oh oh ohh-oh-oh, and I pray

[Verse 1]
I just can't sleep tonight
Knowing that things ain't right
It's in the papers, it's on the TV, it's everywhere that I go
Children are crying, soldiers are dying, some people don't have a home

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times beyond that pain
Hey, can you tell me how I can make a change?

[Chorus]
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray

[Verse 2]
I lose my appetite (Can't eat, can't eat)
Knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner, 'cause of my dinner, still there on my plate?
Ooh I got a vision, to make a difference, and it's starting today

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times beyond that pain
Heaven, tell me I can make a change

[Chorus]
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray (And I pray)
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and

[Bridge]
I pray for the brokenhearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lungs not breathing
I pray for all the souls in need, I pray
Can you give 'em one today?

[Pre-Chorus]
I just can't sleep tonight
Can someone tell me how to make a change?

[Chorus]
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and

[Outro]
I pray
I pray
I pray
I close my eyes and pray

[Verse 1]
Look out of any window
Any morning, any evening, any day
Maybe the sun is shining
Birds are winging or rain is falling from a heavy sky

[Chorus 1]
What do you want me to do
To do for you to see you through?
For this is all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon, long ago

[Verse 2]
Walk out of any doorway
Feel your way, feel your way like the day before
Maybe you'll find direction
Around some corner where it's been waiting to meet you

[Chorus 2]
What do you want me to do
To watch for you while you are sleeping?
Then please don't be surprised
When you find me dreaming, too

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Look into any eyes you find by you
You can see clear through to another day
Maybe it's been seen before through other eyes
On other days while going home

[Chorus 3]
What do you want me to do
To do for you, to see you through?
It's all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon, long ago

[Verse 4]
Walk into splintered sunlight
Inch your way through dead dreams to another land
Maybe you're tired and broken
Your tongue is twisted with words half spoken and thoughts unclear

[Chorus 4]
What do you want me to do
To do for you, to see you through?
A box of rain will ease the pain
And love will see you through

[Verse 5]
Just a box of rain, wind, and water
Believe it if you need it, if you don't, just pass it on
Sun and shower, wind and rain
In and out the window like a moth before a flame

[Outro]
And it's just a box of rain
I don't know who put it there
Believe it if you need it
Or leave it if you dare
And it's just a box of rain
Or a ribbon for your hair
Such a long long time to be gone
And a short time to be there

[Verse 1]
I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep that night 'til the morning came around

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 2]
Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
Spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 3]
I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and he vanished in the air

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, babe, and the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

[Verse 4]
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

[Verse 4]
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Head's all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you

Well, she can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a willys in four wheel drive
She's a summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive
Sugar magnolia
Ringing that bluebell
Caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on honey, come along with me

She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Crazy in the sunlight, yes, indeed

Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander around
I wander 'round

Sunshine daydream
Walking in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming like a red rose
Breathing more freely
Ride out singin', I'll walk you in the morning sunshine

Sunshine daydream
Sunshine daydream
Walking in the sunshine
Operator, can you help me
Help me if you please
Give me the right area code
And the number that I need

My rider left upon the midnight flyer
Singing like a summer breeze

I think she's somewhere down South
Down about Baton Rouge
But I just can't remember no number
A number I can use

Directory don't have it, central done forgot it
I've gotta find a number to use

Trying to check out her number
Trying to run down her line
Operator said that's privileged information
And it ain't no business of mine
It's flooding down in Texas, the poles are out in Utah
Got to find a private line

She could be hanging round the steel mill
Working in a house of blue lights
Riding a getaway bus out of Portland
Talking to the night

I don't know where she's going, I don't care where she's been
Long as she's been doing it right

Long as she's been doing it right

[Verse 1]
Fare you well, my honey
Fare you well, my only true one
All the birds that were singing
Have flown except you alone

Goin' to leave this brokedown palace
On my hands and my knees, I will roll, roll, roll
Make myself a bed by the waterside
In my time - in my time - I will roll, roll roll

[Chorus]
In a bed, in a bed
By the waterside I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Verse 2]
River gonna take me
Sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing me sweet and sleepy
All the way back home
It's a far-gone lullaby
Sung many years ago
Mama, Mama many worlds I've come
Since I first left home

[Chorus]
Going home, going home
By the water-side I will rest my bones
Listen to the river sing sweet songs to rock my soul

[Verse 3]
Going to plant a weeping willow
On the banks green edge it will grow, grow, grow
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go - the river roll, roll, roll

[Chorus]
In a bed, in a bed, by the waterside I will lay my head
Fare you well, fare you well, I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul

[Verse 1]
Till the morning comes, it'll do you fine
Till the morning comes, like a highway sign
Showing you the way, leaving no doubt
Of the way on in or the way back out

[Chorus]
Tell you what I'll do
I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy

[Verse 2]
Till we all fall down, it'll do you fine
Don't think about what you left behind
The way you came or the way you go
Let your tracks be lost in the dark and snow

[Chorus]
Tell you what I'll do
I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy

[Verse 3]
When the shadows grow, it'll do you fine
When the cold winds blow, it'll ease your mind
The shape it takes could be yours to choose
What you may win, what you may lose

[Chorus]
Tell you what I'll do
I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy

[Outro]
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy

[Verse]
In the attics of my life
Full of cloudy dreams unreal
Full of tastes no tongue can know
And lights no eye can see
When there was no ear to hear
You sang to me

I have spent my life
Seeking all that's still unsung
Bent my ear to hear the tune
And closed my eyes to see
When there were no strings to play
You played to me

In the book of love's own dream
Where all the print is blood
Where all the pages are my days
And all my lights grow old
When I had no wings to fly
You flew to me
You
Flew
To me

In the secret space of dreams
Where I dreaming lay amazed
When the secrets all are told
And the petals all unfold
When there was no dream of mine
You dreamed of me

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine;
Houston, too close to New Orleans;
New York's got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats that you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they gotta get goin'
Out of the door and down to the street all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
Been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
Takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowlin' pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, oh no

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me;
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Chorus 6]
Truckin', I'm a goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now get back truckin' home

[Verse 1]
Look a-yonder comin'
Comin' down that railroad track
Hey, look a-yonder comin'
Comin' down that railroad track
It's the Orange Blossom Special
Bringin' my baby back

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm going down to Florida
And get some sand in my shoes
Or maybe Californy
And get some sand in my shoes
I'll ride that Orange Blossom Special
And lose these New York blues

[Interlude]
"Say man, when you going back to Florida?"
"When am I goin' back to Florida? I don't know, don't reckon I ever will."
"Ain't you worried about getting your nourishment in New York?"
"Well, I don't care if I do-die-do-die-do-die-do-die."

[Verse 3]
Hey talk about a-ramblin'
She's the fastest train on the line
Talk about a-travellin'
She's the fastest train on the line
It's that Orange Blossom Special
Rollin' down the seaboard line

[Verse 1]
Well, this job I've got is just a little too hard
I'm running out of money, Lord, I need more pay
I'm gonna wake up in the morning, Lord, I'm gonna pack my bags
I'm gonna beat it on down the line

[Chorus 1]
I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
I'm gonna beat it on down the line

[Verse 2]
I'll be waiting at the station, Lord, when that train pulls on by
And I'm going back where I belong
And now I'm going north to my same old used-to-be
Well, now, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Chorus 2]
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Whoa, coal mine (Coal mine)
Old coal mine (Coal mine)
Whoa, coal mine (Coal mine)
Coal mine (Coal mine)
Whoa, coal mine (Coal mine)
Now, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I'm going back to that shack way across the railroad track
Uh huh, that's where I think I belong
Yes, and I, got a sweet woman, Lord, yeah, who's waiting there for me
Well, that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Outro]
Whoa, happy home (Happy home)
Ah, happy home (Happy home)
Oh, happy home (Happy home)
Whoa, happy, a happy, happy (Happy home)
Happy home (Happy home)
Whoa, happy home (Happy home)
Whoa, now, that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Intro: Harmonica solo]

[Outro]
Hey baby now, yes I do, ha, yes I do now
Hey, I got to, hey, I got to come on home with you

Hey, I wanna keep your company

See I mean a rap not bust around
Just bust a cap dap row bust some spade

I’m looking at the man on the wall in the mirror
Snuff can get enough of that funky dope style
Touch the dial while I smile a while for a mile
Cause I kick kind of like karate, Miyagi, jujutsu

[Ludacris]
Damn, pause stop flow
That was like twenty years ago
I must've stole that shit from myself

[Verse]
Well, she's coming down the stairs
Combing back her yellow hair
And I ain't going to be treated this old way
This old way
And I ain't going to be treated this old way
Well, she went up to her room where she sang her faithful tune
Well, I'm going where those chilly winds don't blow
Winds don't blow
Well, I'm going were those chilly winds don't blow
Well, I married me a wife
She's been trouble all my life
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow

[Outro]
Run me out in the cold rain and snow
Run me out in the cold rain and snow

[Verse 1]
Mississippi River, so big and wide
Blond-haired woman on the other side

Blond-haired woman the cause of it all

Now she's gone, gone, gone, and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

I saw her in Dallas and El Paso
Said, "Come back, baby, I need you so"

I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry today
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today

There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway

Oh, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Verse]
Well, now the doctor call me crazy
Sometimes I am, sometimes I ain't
Said now the doctor call me crazy
Sometimes I am, sometimes I ain't
Yes, and the preacher man call me sinner
But his little girl call me a saint
Well a couple shots of whiskey
Women around here start looking good
I said a couple shots of whiskey
Women round here start looking good
A couple more shots of whiskey
I'm going down to Minglewood

[Chorus]
Said, I was born in the desert
Raised in a lion's den
Said, I was born in the desert
Raised in a lion's den
Yes and my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men
I was born in the desert
Raised in a lion's den
I was born in the desert
Raised in a lion's den
Oh, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Verse 1]
The judge decreed it, the clerk he wrote it
Clerk he wrote it down indeed-e
Judge decreed it, clerk he wrote it down
Give you this jail sentence, you'll be Nashville bound

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Some got six months, some got one solid
Some got one solid year indeed-e

You may know by that I've got a friend somewhere

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uh, picture life in the movie frame
Smiles in your face but errybody fake
Tryna claim a role, actin' on the stage
The world want a show and we are the play
S-S-Say, why didn't you want me yesterday
I blacked out, got some change, now they feelin' me
Couple chains, gold chains on, Mr. T
They see me low-key so, nigga, don't bother me
I wanna relax with some time all just for me
'Cause lately, I been meetin' girls, chasin' me
Wantin' the spotlight, damn, she spotted me
Dang, you bad, baby, let me tell you one thing

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, Tyga]
You got it, I like how you flaunt it
And I need it, I really, really want it

'Til morning, I be up in the mornin'
What I gotta do to meet you? (Uh)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
The fame don't mean nothing, neither does the money
I just want my friend right here with me
The light will fade away, no matter how hard I grind
Today ain't the day, so I'm just gonna live my life
All day long, same shit, different video
All them silly games, I don't wanna play no more

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, Tyga]
You got it, I like how you flaunt it
And I need it, I really, really want it
Can I get, oh, your love? (Your love)

[Intro]
Hey now, now
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin down some rock 'n' roll
"Lotta soul," he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive

[Chorus]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

[Verse 2]
I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

[Chorus]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

[Chorus]
Starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

[Verse 1]

Ha, I ain't gotta say it, I'll show you

[Chorus]

But it's more to you than just that
Well I won't complain if you throw it back, yeah

Oh, if it's loving that you need from me, yeah

Better put your hands up if you wanna knuckle up
Take you for that ride, better buckle up
I got bands up for them dancers
When your shift is up, you come fuck with us

Got that Ghost door outside waitin'
Snap, snap, popo, cameras hatin'

Communication with your lady in my new Mercedes (Yeah)
I'm ridin' 'round with my top down
Too much smoke up in her weave
Better let that shit air out (Yikes!)
Better give me that nana

Gold ticket like a nigga Willy Wonka
But you know a nigga really want you
Bang, bang, I do the damn thing

[Outro]
Liquor got me tipsy, I'm slow leanin'
Lookin' at her titties, she high beamin'
She lookin' at my chain but, all she really want is my semen
I'ma let her get it, right on the face, clear it up like Noxzema
You know a nigga like me, I can do a rap song any day of the week
Singin' ass nigga, tatted up though, ladies know I'm a freak
You know I'm a freak, you know I'm a freak
It's Breezy, bitch, yikes, a nigga cold on the beat
Yikes, cold as ice

[Intro: Usher & Pharrell]
Let me put my shades on
Everybody come around

[Chorus: Usher]
You got it twisted
Now tell me, why you wanna do me that way?
You got it twisted
You introducing shit, you know I don't play
You had me looking stupid, but I let it go that way
That booty substituted, guess that made it okay
You had me stuck on stupid, but I let it go that way
I'm suffering from delusion, I should put myself away

[Verse 1: Usher]
All the time and money I've spent
Can't believe what I'm in, it ain't right
If I come back, do you promise it's gon' be you and me and the sea?
"Whatever"
No?

[Chorus: Usher]
You got it twisted
Now tell me, why you wanna do me that way?
You got it twisted
You introducing shit, you know I don't play
You had me looking stupid, but I let it go that way
That booty substituted, guess that made it okay
You had me stuck on stupid, but I let it go that way
I'm suffering from delusion, I should put myself away

[Verse 2: Usher]
How come I every time my crew around
Just so happen you around, you got to show out?
It ain't right
And all that flinging your hair, glossing your lips
Shaking your hips every time you go out

[Chorus: Usher]
You got it twisted
Now tell me, why you wanna do me that way?
You got it twisted
You introducing shit, you know I don't play
You had me looking stupid, but I let it go that way
That booty substituted, guess that made it okay
You had me stuck on stupid, but I let it go that way
I'm suffering from delusion, I should put myself away

[Interlude: Pharrell]
Hey, all the girls, all the girls
Make sure your skirt ain't too tight
What we doing is gon' have a lot of fun
With me and you, tonight, come on

[Bridge: Usher]
You gotta twist it to the left and twist it to the right
Twist it like you love it, go twist that thing all night
Twist it to the left and twist it to the right
Twist it like you love it, yeah, twist that thing all night

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
She felt so alive, said her home life was so dead
Twenty of us on Vespas and Mopeds
Oh, there she go in there, oh, can I hold that?
What you talking ‘bout? Go ahead, forehead
Told her homegirl, now it’s getting worse and
And I was trying to hook her up with Usher
So I gave her that white Chanel lipstick
She said “How you get more out?” Twist it

[Chorus: Usher]
You got it twisted
Now tell me, why you wanna do me that way?
You got it twisted
You introducing shit, you know I don't play
So glad you had me looking stupid, but I let it go that way
That booty substituted, guess that made it okay
You had me stuck on stupid, but I let it go that way
I'm suffer from delusion, I should put myself away

[Outro: Usher]
Oh yeah, I see you
Keep twisting, baby
She can't ever get enough
Benzi! Play that shit

Alright, Diplo, Ah
Guess who's biz-ack?
Pose not Paws
Don't call me that
Let me close that one time, this is nothing and everything all at the same time
When did I become an asshole? Ah
Don't answer that, leave a dime on the fifth
I can handle that
Lower eight will do
Fuck I'll take a 5 she got big boobs, (alright)
I'm sorry if the last line was offensive
But fuck it though, I meant it

She likes gold, she likes plat
I got a couple bucks I can get that
But I like ray and I like black, I chameleon, I can match that

I don't wanna keep on changing colors, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna keep on changing colors, yeah, yeah
That's why I'm never gonna try to be an actor
DMX used to be my favorite rapper
I'm just trying to be the same as I used to
But it's hard when they all tryna use you
So let me pull the brakes, slow down
Is it cool if I come back soon, cause I'm just tryna take a little break
Didn't think so, let me think though
I don't wanna play it back like Ringo
He just hit em with the Bone Thugs mix
Mixed with the he can really kinda sing flow, oh

I don't wanna keep on changing colors, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna keep on changing colors, yeah, yeah
I, I, got a pocket full of sunshine
I, I, wanna share it with you
I, I got a pocket full of sunshine
I, I, wanna share it with you. (uh)

It's the Pose and Benzi Show
That was one take!
Do I get a prize for that or something?
Fuck man, there's no love for me

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I don't wanna go there
We should never go there
Damn, why you wanna go there?
I guess I gotta go there

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're hearing rumors about me and you can't stomach the thought
Of someone touching my body when you're so close to my heart
I won't deny what they saying because most of it is true
But it was all before I fell for you, so please, babe

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
(Oh)
Let it be beautifu-u-ul (Oh)
Let it be beautiful (Oh)
Let it be beautifu-u-ul (Oh)
Let it be beautiful

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Everything I say right now is gonna be used in another fight
And I've been through this so many times
Can we change the subject?
You gonna start asking me questions like
"Was she attractive? Was she an actress?"
Baby, the fact is

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're hearing rumors about me and saw some pictures online
Saying they got you so angry, making you wish you were blind
Before we start talking crazy, saying some things we'll regret
Can we just slow it down and press reset? (Damn)
You're beautiful, so baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
(So baby)
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Just let the past, just be the past
And focused on things that are gonna make us laugh
Take me as I am (Take me as I am) and not who I was (Not who I was)
I'll promise I'll be the one that you can trust, so please

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
So please don't judge me (Don't judge me)
And I won't judge you (And I won't 'cause)
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you (No, I won't)
And if you love me (If you love me), then let it be beautiful, babe

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
Let it be beautifu-u-ul (Oh, ooh)
Let it be beautiful (Let it)
Let it be, oh
Let it be beautiful, ayy
Let it be beautiful
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter & Both]
I don't wanna go there, baby (Be there)
We should never go there (Oh)

A whole lot of horses
That’s your wifey dawg? I’d divorce her
She won’t fuck you, you had to force her
Oh I’ve been poppin’ Rose with Amber
You catch me in D Woods like a camper
The answer is I get bitches and I get money

Free my nigga Lil' ‘cause he said that
This that shit and I be on it like a fly
I’m just tryna get some chicken with some yams up on the side

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 1]
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must the white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?

[Refrain]
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

[Verse 2]
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
'Fore it is washed to the sea?

Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?

[Refrain]
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

[Verse 3]
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?

[Refrain]
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

[Verse 1]
Rollin’ in a broken Mitsubishi with no AC
And a couple stolen TV’s and a seatbelt for my safety
Play the passenger, I think it’s five years after eighty-
Seven, do that math, 92, don’t you be lazy
I’m looking out the window, notice all the essentials
Of a block party that stopped for a second
Then it rekindled like the flame from a trick candle
Everybody got dental insurance, ‘cause we bout to floss
You get the couch I sent you?
I heard that from a block away, probably had credentials
Of a scholar, but should not today
Them Dayton spokes was his to take
Refrigerators, barbecue pits, and Jordan kicks
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it
Hello, my Mr. Myiagi, I want them Kenwood Woofers
Say that you got me
If not, I’ll dig in your drawer for it
The swap meet was the bullseye like a Taurus is
Murder was the melody, you should know what the chorus is
You really telling me we can just get some more of it if we run out?
He said “Lil nigga, today the poor is rich”
Don't tell your mom that you seen a molotov bomb
And if she asks, just know that you have to lie
And son, don’t forget:
You from Compton

[Verse 2]
Brace yourself, I take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I’m slinging brick and moving cane
Cul de sac and plenty Cognac in major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that’s weighing on your brain
It was me, O-Boog and Yaya
Lucky, ride down Rosecrans
Ugly, waving yo hand out the window, brace yourself, uh
Warriors and Conans
Euphoria can slow dance
Society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed
Light skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where (mmm) hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was looking at him different
That was back when I was nine
Joey packed a nine
Pakistan on every porch, it’s fine
We adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
Sliding door, fuck is up?
Fucking shooting forth, if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk
Picking up the fucking pump
Picking off you suckers, suck a dick
Die a sucker punch, a ball of bullets coming from
AK’s, AR’s, Aye y’all; duck
That’s what Mama said when we was eatin’ that free lunch
Aw man, god damn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in ‘94, fuck yo truce
Now crawl yo head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
And no peace treaties just peace and BG’s appearing to prove
Bodies on top of bodies, IV’s on top of IV’s
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolly, your color’s correct
Make sure each corporate knows they’ll be calling your mother collect
Now, what you expect?
My life is a threat
Good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Life or death, is you with me?

[Outro]
Tim Westwood, what's up

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Am I crazy? Am I foolish?
Just a little too into you, that's for sure, oh babe
What your beauty does to me
Makes me forget about your faults, you do no wrong, whoa-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
They say everybody plays the fool sometimes
And if I've got to, I don't mind
I'll be the best damn fool for you, no lie

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
There's something about you, baby
And I swear that it drive me crazy

Oh-whoa

[Verse 2: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
It's confusing, how you do it
It's like you take my heart and glue it to your soul, yeah, baby
And I'd do anything for you, oh you know that much it's true
Girl, I'm so in love, I'm stupid

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]

'Cause I can't think of nothing else
You got me stuck on stupid, I'm stuck on stupid for you
Oh-oh
Look what you do

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
If you told me to go rock climbing to prove my love to you
You know I would've died trying, got everything to lose
I'm not tryna play it cool
The stupid things I do, I do it for you, oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
There's something about you, baby (Hey)
And I swear that it drives me crazy (Whoa)
I'm stuck on you, baby, stuck on you, babe
(Girl, I'm stuck)
And I might need help (Ooh)
'Cause I can't think of nothing else (Whoa)
You got me stuck on stupid, I'm stuck on stupid for you
Oh-oh
Baby, look what you do to me

[Intro: Chris Brown]
Damn
Ha, leggo

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
The wheels on the Bugatti go 'round, 'round, 'round
Tappahannock in V.A., yep, that's my town, town, town
If you wanna, we can do this, girl, right now, now, now

Yeah, I'm gettin' money, I'ma name my price
Thousand bottles on these models
Nigga, this ain't your night
Franck Muller got a nigga chillin'
How that bitch feel with ice?
My bassline to her waistline
A nigga 'bout to bust them pipes
I'm wildin', money pilin'
Two dime twins with they thighs bent
And the way I kick it will make Bruce Lee want to throw the towel in
Man, life is just so glorious
You could never worry us
You niggas just be playin' Big Gravy in Notorious
I said them girls in the front, bet that Breezy make 'em jump
O-Over here we got that loud, over there they got this bump
B-B-Boy, we do this every night, you got to save up for a month
And you just say I'm blowin' smoke, but nigga, I'm just bein' blunt

[Chorus: Chris Brown]

[Outro]
You have reached your destination

[Intro: Chris Brown]
Yikes!
Haha, where we at with it?
Help me out
Haha
Bounce
Yeah
Like some poor juices, ain't you been good with that?
Hahaha

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Eyes must be wide shut
Liquor got you open, closin' your blinders
Just in case you need a friendly reminder
Let me take this bullet, bullet out my head (Ow!)
Change your body, need advisor
Car too big, but fuck it, don't need a driver (Nah)
All me want is a girl who be a rider (Yeah)
Can't believe she pull it, pull it
Nigga gun, gun pow

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
But she want me to hold her, hold her down (Haha)
Sorry boo boo, you gets no love, no love now (No love, no love)
Must be cuckoo, got me fucked up (Haha), fucked up, wow (Got me fucked up)
You know a nigga ain't gon' hold ya, hold ya down

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm a mirage
Ha, fuck I look like?
I'm a mirage (Haha), haha
What the fuck I look like? (Yikes!)
It's all in your mind, your mind
Fuck I look like?
Open your eyes, you're blind
What the fuck I look like?

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Yeah, girl, your mind should apologize to ya
Keep on tellin' all of those crazy lies to ya
You believe 'em all, don't wanna accept the truth
Who the fuck you kiddin', kiddin', what's the use?
Sad to see you playin' the fool
You don't know half the shit that a nigga been through
I guess you got your reward, reward for it (Ha, yeah)
You actin' like you don't need me, babe

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
But she want me to hold her, hold her down (Got me fucked up, babe)
Sorry boo boo, you gets no love, no love now (Hahaha, yeah)
Must be cuckoo, got me fucked up, fucked up, wow (Babe, bravado)
You know a nigga ain't gon' hold ya, hold ya down
Haha, excuse my French, but (Ha)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm a mirage
Ha, fuck I look like? (You can't see me)
I'm a mirage (Haha, look)
What the fuck I look like?
It's all in your mind, your mind (What?)
Fuck I look like?
Open your eyes, you're blind (You got me fucked up)
What the fuck I look like?

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yeah, you lookin' for love, and I'm the one you imagine
With athlete money from just rappin'
My body wrapped in some Valentino, Loro Piana fashion
Sex with passion, romancin', laughin'
Happiness, action, restaurants, relaxin'
They got some good sushi in Aspen, that good pussy I'm smashin'
I call you Matsuhisa, yeah, I'm your Visa
American Express, I must confess
I'm tryna go beyond love and this is hard to translate
Love is good, but to me, good is just the enemy of great
You wanna make it to the top, but you don't got what it take
To be a model, actress, singer, stripper
Want me to help you to become a star, you was my sister
You was my soldier, damn, I used to miss ya, uh
I used to love ya, I fiend to hold ya
You didn't know me, it was only just a mirage

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Nas]
A mirage (Mirage)
(Uh, you didn't know me, it was just a mirage)
Ha, fuck I look like?
(Just a mirage)
I'm a mirage
(Mirage, you know Nas)
What the fuck I look like? (Yeah)
It's all in your mind, your mind
Fuck I look like?
Open your eyes, you're blind (Do it, baby)
What the fuck I look like? (Yeah)

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Right
What the fuck I look like?
Fucked up
What the fuck I look like?
I guess I'd have to say this album is
Dedicated to you
Although perhaps I may not be happy
This is what you want
So I conceded
I hope it makes you happy
There's a lot of truth in it, babe
I don't think I'll have many regrets, baby
Things didn't have to be the way they was, baby
You don't have the right to use the son of mine
To keep me in line
One thing I can't do without
Is the boy whom God gave to both of us
I'm so happy, oh, for the son of mine
So here it is, babe
I hope you enjoy, reminisce, be happy
Think about the kisses and the joy
But there were those other moments too
The times that were cloudy and grey
Bad
But you taught me that was life
May love ever possess you
May peace come into your life
Always think of me the way I was
Ha, I was your baby
This is what you wanted
Here, dear, here it is
Here, my dear, here it is

[Intro: Jhené Aiko]
Faire l'amour lendemain

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
What if the sky was turning red?
I know we'd be safe right here in my bed, laying face to face
Oh girl, I love the way you sound when you rain on me
So tonight let's act it out, and show you how it's gon' be
I'm gon' kiss your other set of lips
Hold your body by your legs and hips
The world can't end until we're finished
Girl, we gon'

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And we gon' do it like it's 'bout to be the end of the world
And they depending on us
To make Earth-shaking love
As we lay down, lay down
Telling me to go harder, go harder
You're telling me to go deeper, go deeper
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker
We can go longer if you just lay down, lay down, down

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
All these vibrations from your legs, massaging my back
I got your body shivering 'cause we're covered in sweat
And girl, I like the way it opens up when you throw it back, baby
Girl, it might be too much, oh baby, if you keep doing that
I got that pillow for your knees right here
Baby, can you make it disappear?
Your voice is the last thing I'm gonna hear
Then I wanna make you holler

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Jhené Aiko]
We gon' do it like it's 'bout to be the end of the world
And they depending on us
To make Earth-shaking love
As we lay down, lay down
And you're, you're telling me to go harder, go harder
You're telling me to go deeper, go deeper
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker
We can go longer as we lay down, lay down, down

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Do it like we only got one (Got one)
Baby, let's pretend we only got one night
One last time, let me take my time
And do it to you right
Buildings and bridges may be falling down
But that won't stop me from turning that thing around, girl, yeah
Won't you come on over
And we can treat it like it's the motherfuckin'

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
End of the world? (Woo!)
And they depending on us (And they depending on us to make it)
To make Earth-shaking love
As we lay down, lay down (We can, we can)
Telling me to go harder, go harder
(A nigga goin' hard in the paint, you think I can't)
You're telling me to go deeper, go deeper
(A nigga so deep, underwater, can you feel my submarine?)
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker
(Use my hands, and baby, you gon' get this rain)
We can go longer if you just lay down (Lay down), lay down, down (Lay down)

[Outro: Chris Brown]
A nigga goin' hard in the paint, you think I can't?
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint, you think I can't?
(Lay, lay, lay down)
Goin' for miles, no stops
(So good, lay down)
A nigga goin' hard in the paint (Right now)
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint (Just take that)
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint, you think I can't? (Get it, get it)
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint, you think I can't? (Get it, get it)
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint (Get it, lay down)
Watch a nigga go hard in the paint

[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Yeah, uh, it's going out to all the pimps and macs
Y'all know the flavor, Brooklyn style
You know how we do, uh, yeah
All the macs and the dons in the house
Playa playas, playa, playa, let these hoes know
One, two

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Is it true, all I wanna do is screw?
Drink brew, with the crew, on the avenue? Ooh!
I flip skins like Mary Lou
So what ya gonna do when Shelton come for you, boo?
I got girls that look like Toni Braxton
And give me the skins without askin'
When I'm relaxin' on my back and you know what time it is (uh)
But if it's red, man, I'll leave it alone
She can call me on my cellular phone
And I mess around and pick you up
Take you to the crib, stick you up
Put on my Silk CD and lick you up and down
'Til you say stop, hit the twat 'til your pops call the cops
And when I make bail outta jail, I'ma wail on that tail
(Why, Shel'?) Because the sex never fails, I am

[Hook: Erick Serson & The Notorious B.I.G.]
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing and I been waiting
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm
This is for the macs and dons
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm
This is for the macs and dons

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
"What kind of girls do you like?" Well, that's various
I like long hair, or them Halle Berry cuts
Real big butts, yeah, thick with lipstick
'Cause when it come to girls, I'm so optimistic
Like the Sounds of Blackness
I don't need practice in the sack
It's natural, I break your back in
I pop coochies like my homeboy Luke
Guaranteed to knock your trees off your Timbo boots
You don't get pussy-whipped, you whip that pussy
Hit it from the back 'til it get real gushy, baby
Good sex is what I'm startin'
I get the skin so wet, I make the ass start fartin'
And I pray that dick don't slip
'Cause then I'm hearin' this shit: "That's not it"
And then I just ride 'til the sun rise
And when I'm done, wipe the cum on her thighs, I am

[Hook: Erick Serson & The Notorious B.I.G.]
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing and I been waiting
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm
This is for the macs and dons
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm
This is for the macs and dons

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
This is going out to the pimps and macs
That hit skins 'til their broad catch a asthma attack
But not even Pamatti Miss could resist
The way I jumped up and dissed the clitoris
All I wanna do is zoom-a-zoom in the boom poom (Uh, uh)
Smoke a little boom, get some head in the bedroom
And then I whisper soft in her ear:
"You ain't got to home, but you got to leave from here"
Simple and plain, no strings attached
I'm lettin' you know that I'm a certified mac
I hit skins 'til the leg cramps
So on the first I can get half the check and half the stamps

[Hook: Erick Serson & The Notorious B.I.G.]
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing and I been waiting
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm
This is for the macs and dons
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm
This is for the macs and dons

[Outro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
All the players in '94, recognize
Shelton D in full effect, baby, baby
Uh, uh, yeah, fuck all you bitches

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I dreamed of kush blunts, hot fashion and females
She never smoked once but love the way the weed smells
Pistols in the front, choppers on the back porch
Lord knows I wanna teach him but he asked for
So im doin words, let my money do the talking
I think the game needs some change like you do for parking
We the planes, you motherfuckers ground control
We escape, skip the rates, pick a cloud and go
My chick by racial, bisexual, buy everything I want soon as I let her know
I snap my fingers and God will be there to hunt your head
Call me the deep and you try and sink like the London Bridge
Big city small problems, hate me cause I get a plate often
What are they starving? Where I'm at? tourin
Say you got another question, call it
Ask me if I'm ballin
Wow

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
You would think we in a waterbed
All the sheets are soaked
I'm glad that I ain't gotta work today
'Cause last night I did the most
Girl, you would think I was inside your head
'Cause I know everything you want
And no one asked you if you got a man and do I care? I don't
That's when we started sexing

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
It's getting loud (Loud)
Got 'em feeling like they in the clouds (Clouds)
Got them screaming like they in the crowd
I make them scream
Baby, baby, baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
When you scream
I need to pull your body closer, let me sex you, babe
Girl, you better not change your mind (Don't you change, girl, you're staying)
'Cause girl, we got one night only
And I want just to love right, baby
You're my biggest fan, girl, I want you to holler

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
Oh-whoa-oh-whoa
(Yeah, damn)
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
(I want you to holler)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
Two girls, I'm watching (Hahaha)
"No" is not an option (No)
I'm gon' be the captain of the ship
They gon' have my boat a-rocking
Singing to them like Lionel Richie, all night long
Getting these bitches, they playing my song
We switching positions and I got the money so I'm granting they wishes (Oh)
I'll be they sugar daddy

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
It's getting loud (Loud)
Got 'em feeling like they in the clouds (Clouds)
Got them screaming like they in the crowd
I make them scream (Oh-whoa)
When you

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
When you scream (Oh)
I need to pull your body closer, let me sex you, babe
(Just let me sex you, girl)
Girl, you better not change your mind (Don't you change, don't you change, don't you change)
'Cause girl, we got one night only
And I want just to love right, baby (Girl, you're my)
You're my biggest fan, girl, I want you to holler
(For me, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Gon' girl, tear it up, you can make it clap, for me, girl, give it up
Goddamn, you fine, I'm 'bout to stand up, stand up
I just came here just to make you holler
Doing it for hours, even in the shower
Over and over again
Baby, I'm all up in your garden, kissing flowers
Are you ready? I'ma take what's mine and get comfortable
Slow and easy, I'm kinda tipsy off this wine
So what I say might be a little confusing
I got a Magnum in my wallet, I'ma pull it out, I bet that I use it
I'm gon' make you scream

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
When you scream
I need to pull your body closer, let me sex you, babe (Oh-whoa)
Girl, you better not change your mind (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
'Cause girl, we got one night only (Yeah)
And I want just to love right, baby (Love you right)
You're my biggest fan, girl, I want you to holler
When you scream
I need to pull your body closer, let me sex you, babe
Girl, you better not change your mind
'Cause girl, we got one night only
And I want just to love right, baby
You're my biggest fan, girl, I want you to holler

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Oh-whoa-oh-whoa
Oh-whoa-oh-whoa

[Verse]
I went down one day
I went down to see a gypsy woman just one
Day, yes I did
I wanna find out
What's wrong with me and my baby
We ain't been getting down like we used to do
I mean it's pretty good now
But there was a time when it didn't work out
Too well
I went down to see this gypsy woman, you
Understand
And I told her my story
I told her what was going on
And she turned to me and she said
All you need
All you need
All you need
All you gotta have
Just a touch, that's all you gotta have
Just a touch of mojo hand
And it feels pretty good

[Verse 1]
I got money, everything that I ever wanted
Never thought of what I might need, need, need
Ain't it funny, how I spend my whole life running
Reaching for the sky-y and coming down with nothing?

[Chorus]
It feels like I'm four years old all over again
Because I'm just running fast but should be walking
Saying, "When I grow up you gon' see
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy"

[Verse 2]
I guess I was faking 'cause look at all the money I'm making
Still nothing can compare to the thought of love
But it's taking too much time to see that I'm wasting
Reaching for the sky-y and coming down with nothing

[Chorus]
It feels like I'm four years old all over again
'Cause I just keep running fast but should be walking
Saying, "When I grow up you gon' see
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy"

[Bridge]
I'm so alone
I feel so alone
So alone in this world
Got everything I want

[Chorus]
It feels like I'm four years old all over again
'Cause I just keep running fast but should be walking (Hey-hey)
Saying, "When I grow up you gon' see
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy"

[Outro]
Oh-whoa
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa-whoa
Oh-whoa
Oh, oh

[Cryptical Envelopment]

The other day they waited, the sky was dark and faded
Solemnly they stated, "He has to die, you know he has to die."
All the children learnin', from books that they were burnin'
Every leaf was turnin'; to watch him die, you know he has to die

The summer sun looked down on him, his mother could but frown on him
And all the others sound on him, but it doesn't seem to matter

And when the day had ended, with rainbow colors blended
His mind remained unbended, he had to die, you know he had to die

[The Faster We Go, the Rounder We Get]

Spanish lady comes to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat came 'round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

Comin', comin', comin' around, comin', around
Comin', around, in a circle
Comin', comin', comin' around, comin' around, in a circle
Comin', comin', comin' around, comin' in a circle
Skippin' through the lily fields I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in it's place
The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to never ever land

Comin', comin', comin' around, comin', around
Comin', around, in a circle
Comin', comin', comin' around, comin' around, in a circle
Comin', comin', comin' around, comin' in a circle

[Cryptical Envelopment Reprise]
And when the day had ended, with rainbow colors blended
Their minds remained unbended
He had to die, Oh, you know he had to die

[Verse 1]
Last leaf fallen bare earth where green was born
Black Madonna two eagles hang against a cloud
Sun comes up blood red wind yells among the stone
All graceful instruments are known

[Verse 2]
When the windows all are broken and your love's become a toothless crone
When the voices of the storm sound like a crowd
Winter morning breaks, you're all alone

[Verse 3]
The eyes are blind, blue visions, all a seer can own
And touching makes the flesh to cry out loud
This ground on which the seed of love is sown
All graceful instruments are known

[Verse 1]
Seems like i've been here before
Fuzzy then and still so obscure, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
And i don't want to see anybody cry

[Chorus]
Meet me some morning in the sweet by and by, by and by, by and by

[Verse 2]
Song coming on
So pleasing to see, come and gone, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You don't have to tell me why

[Chorus]
Meet me some morning in the sweet by and by, by and by, by and by

[Verse 3]
It ain't 'cause i'm the only one left, darling
'Bout the time the sun rises west
Feeling groovy, looking fine
Think I'll come back here again
Every now and then, from time to time
My how lovely you are, my dear
The ball game has gone much too far, my dear
Sing to me, do your thing to me

[Outro]
I'll meet you some morning, meet you some morning
In the sweet by and by, by and by, by and by

[Verse 1]
Sleepy alligator in the noonday sun
Lying by the river just like he usually done (oh no)
Call for his whiskey
He can call for his tea
Call all he want to (now) but he can't call me

[Chorus]
Oh no, well I been there before
(there before)
And I'm not coming back around
There no more
(there no more)
Hold up, waiting for a windy day

[Verse 2]
Creepy alligator coming all around the bend
Talking 'bout the times when we was mutual friends
I'll check my memory and I will check it quick
Yes I will (yes I will)
I'll check it running some old kind of trick

[Chorus]
Whoa no
Oh no, well I been there before
And I ain't coming back around there no more
No I'm not

[Bridge]
(Burn down the Fillmore, gas the Avalon)
(Turn on the hippies, leave the heat alone)
(Bird shit over on the avenue)

[Verse 3]
Riding down the river in an old canoe
A bunch of bugs and an old tennis shoe
Out of the river all ugly and green
The biggest old alligator that I have ever seen
Teeth big and pointy and his eyes were bugging out
(were bugging out)
Contract the union, put the beggars to rout
Screaming and yelling, he was picking his chops
He never run, he just stumbles and hops
Just out of prison on six dollars bail
Mumblin' bitches and wagging his tail

[Outro]
Come on everybody
Get up and dance, it won't ruin ya
Alligator running round my door
Alligator running round my door
Alligator running round my door
Alligator running round my door
Alligator's creepy friend
Been crawling round my cabin floor
Been comin' around to bother me some more
Alligator!
Alligator!

[Intro: Kilo Kish]
Umm, okay
Yea, candy
Uhh, where is this song in my Blackberry?
Yea, yea
Alright cool

[Verse 1: Kilo Kish]
Okay
As my mind run licking cotton candy lipstick
You're right here in my room, yeah I wished it
Candlelight vigil for the one you're texting
Pink sweatpants - hmm, interesting
No need, don't explain to me, love
Cause I know how you deal, but I could see us
In a different way, don't play me cause we're not the same
Sign on, sees your screen name and misbehave
So you're a playboy, you think you're Heff kid?
Hoppin' round town with the bunnies when
I'm the candy that you need, brush your sweet tooth
Heard you got me replaced with a statue?
A veneer, I hear, she's just swell
If you want to date a rock, you think I can't tell?
So you bored? Are you lost? Was it worthwhile?
I feel the ice-cold chill in her warm smile
Saw you last night, you didn't have to act foul
Come and sweep me from the back room
Feel my palms heat up on your chest now
As the night creeps into bedtime vows
Married in a white t-shirt, bed style
Still, you know that I'm the best ride
You deserve what you get: it's called respect
You ever heard of it?

[Chorus: Kilo Kish]
I know what you're missing in your new life
I can find a way to make it go right
Make it go right
Make it go right
I know what you're missing in the moonlight
I can fly away and make it go right
It go
It go

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
I used to front somethin' stupid, now I'm makin' them wait
Except for you mama, I'm ready, I don't wanna be late
Never hesitate, you know it, petty cash, we blow it
Excuse me for imperfect, them halfway looks is worth it
I watched these niggas lurkin', they just want my leftovers
Watching Locked Up all day and slept over
Put your hair back: Afro
Skippin' after-parties at the last show
I'mma hold your hand in little Tokyo
And tell you somethin' in your ear that you shouldn't know
Two jumps, but the feeling was so gone
High school swag, busy fuckin' with clothes on
Lost a couple words, joke around the reason
You can wear my shirt, pretend to let you win that FIFA
There was nothing like it...settle down
You always hit me when my boo around
It's a long walk - we ain't talkin', though
That ratchet ho on lock-n-load, I appreciate the offer, though
I'mma do it right - later, though
'Cause, either way, you're gonna hate me like you say you won't
Thank God for that - it's called regret
You ever heard of it?

[Chorus: Kilo Kish]
I know what you're missing in your new life
I can find a way to make it go right
Make it go right
Make it go right
I know what you're missing in the moonlight
I can fly away and make it go right
It go
It go
I know what you're missing in your new life
I can find a way to make it go right
Make it go right
Make it go right
I know what you're missing in the moonlight
I can fly away and make it go right
It go
It go

[Intro]
It's a mad world out here, I tell you
The world's gone stark, raving mad
Everyone in the world is mad
It's a mad crazy world

[Hook]
I see diamond-flooded demons
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through

[Verse 1]
With a circle on the floor he compels them to be pure
Pulls the beast out of his heart then impales it on a sword
Writes a prayer on some paper and then he nails it to the door
Just the good of you may enter by the mercy of the lord
Listen not to what he speaks, that's been the cursing of his cause
A seduction of his senses by the devils he adores
The unholy has him hostage and his soul is now at war
Follow not his secret knowledge it will bring you no reward
Shun him while in public disallow him from your stores
Have no part in his affairs 'less his pestilence be yours
Make scoundrels of the righteous and virgins into whores
But we must still pray that his color will be cured

[Hook]
I see diamond-flooded demons
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through

[Verse 2]
With her eyes to the ceiling and a needle in her brain
He looks back into the crowd, wipes the blood and then explains
How she slipped from this existence to the realm of the deranged
Her becoming must be halted to reverse what she became
From the looseness of her tongue, to the pollution of her aims
To do nothing is barbaric, the solution is humane
You must destroy the mind and hopefully retrain
You torture out the wildness, then replace it with the tame
Blank slate when she recovers, she won't even know her name
Perfect wife and perfect lover, no resistance, no complaints
May God bless the scientific cure for the insane
Knew she couldn't go to school, but she thought that that should change

[Hook]
I see diamond-flooded demons
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through

[Verse 3]
With his crucifix inside his pocket said his mission is divine
Put his Bible on the bed and then he touched on his behind
Told him take off all his clothes and put your penis next to mine
Now the little boy think it's normal because they do this all the time
With no life inside his body now he finally think he’s safe
But they cut off all his fingers while they piss all in his face
He take pictures with his killers then they sneak back to the states
Now he sit next to the picture of his wife when she was raped
With the teleprompter rolling he looks right into the lens
Doesn’t mention his redemption but absolves him of his sins
He forgives them in advance says that he will do again

[John F. Kennedy]
My fellow Americans...

[Hook]
I see diamond-flooded demons
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through

Late night, coming down Broadway
Niggas ain't stuntin',they riding the four train
These niggas ain't fly, got wings like always
You’re finger-fuckin' the pussy, lickin' it all day
Niggas on me 'cause my position is boss made
Niggas on me 'cause all my fabrics they cost change
He ain't stylin' enough to be ballin'
Kobe Bryant, Odom, Ray Allen, and Paul Pierce
Combined in one frame, Pardon my water, but
This my wave you take orders like my chicken sautéed
Tartar sauce on the fried fish, I ate
Bitches tried to shimmy my shake
Bitches try to Diddy my Ma$e
Who runs the city? I'll break both legs
Best thing going, y'all bitches is okay
Bitches on the wrong course, this my lane
Proper, proper all my propaganda
Puffin with some Rastas, puffin' better puff a shot
Whistle for my masters, coke headed models
Dope on arrival, Visa is en casa
Been in Bahamas, eating all this chocolate
Tell me Willy Wonka-Wonga
I'm a Mack Truck and you niggas are Tonkas
Niggas act up then it's gorillas and their armours
Get clapped up nigga you can get applauded
Stitch you back up, get you fitted in your garments
It will be me on the roof with the harness
Just AZ I don't need no accomplice
Better roll deep with little GG, CC, we we
I'm a bust a nigga and then gun him in the pee pee
Niggas better hide their little brother when they see me
All these niggas riding with they cholos till the heat squeeze

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They said "thou shall not be ill, thou shall not feel
Thou should not be trill, not be drill, not be real"

These niggas really is out here, these niggas really is out here
The block is at war, post traumatic stress

We believe in God, but do God believe in us?
If we believe enough, will we ever get to know him?
That lean got us dozing, we forget that we the chosen

I want to be your object, of your affection
Give me all your time, touch, money, and attention
Pick me up after school, you can be my baby
Maybe we could go somewhere, get a little crazy
He's rich and I'm wishin', um, he could be my Mister Yum
Delicious to the maximum, chew him up like bubble gum
I'm his pretty party favor, he says I'm his favorite flavor

Pick me up after school, actin' kinda shady
You're the coolest kid in town, I'm your little lady
You're sick and I'm kissin' him, magical musician, how I'm
Drivin' at the cinema, lovin' him and lickin' him
He's my lovely life saver
Doesn't mind my bad behavior

Chasin' for that paper and you see me on that race
What, what, tell her I be goin' first

[Verse 1]
They say life is a battlefield
I say bring it on
If you wanna know how I feel
Leave it till it's gone
I'm just saying that what don't kill
Only makes you strong
If you don't recognize what is real
Then forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time

[Pre-Chorus]
Some things never change, here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care anymore

[Chorus]
Let's go numb
You never know until you let go
Let's go numb
I can feel you now

[Verse 2]
Keep on doing the same old thing
And you expecting change
Well, is that really insanity
Or just a loser's game?
I only trust in the things I feel
Some may say that's strange
You better recognize what is real
'Cause forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time

[Pre-Chorus]
Some things never change, here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care anymore

[Chorus]
Let's go numb
You never know until you let go
We all go numb
I can feel you now (numb)
(Numb)

[Bridge]
I can feel you now
I can feel you now
I can feel you now
But you can't feel it, do you?

[Chorus]
(Numb)
Shake it off, then you go, I don't care anymore (numb)
I can feel you now (numb)
I can feel you now (numb)
I can feel you now, I can feel you now

[Outro]
Can you feel it?

[Intro]
Oh, oh, AK!
New day
Oh, oh, AK!
Ow!

[Chorus]
Party people say, party people say, "Aye
It's a new day, it's a new day"
While it's gettin' ready, everybody ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
"Aye, aye, aye, aye aye..."

[Verse 1]
It's your right to feel however you want to
There's no limitation, no
If you love your life, let me see your hands up one time
We'll celebrate mine, 'cause I ain't gonna get no more
So we can do this all night, one time
Everybody say, "Aye aye, oh" (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up
Feeling in my heart that I can't get over
I know that it's coming, let the sun come up
Tell me, do you feel the same? Everybody say..

[Chorus]
Party people say, party people say, "Aye
It's a new day, it's a new day"
While it's gettin' ready, everybody ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
"Aye, aye, aye, aye aye..."

[Verse 2]
See the look in my eyes, can't you see I'm ready, aye
Come along let's get it
If you wanna touch the sky, hands in the air one time
All night and all day
I'mma live it loud like there's only one life left to live it up
One life left to live it up

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up
Feeling in my heart that I can't get over
I know that it's coming, let the sun come up
Tell me, do you feel the same? Everybody say

[Chorus]
Party people say, party people say, "Aye
It's a new day, it's a new day"
While it's gettin' ready, everybody ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
"Aye, aye, aye, aye aye..."

[Bridge]
I saw the world
It's now or never at all
I'm gonna give it my all, oh
Whether I rise or fall, oh
I'm gonna give it my all

[Chorus]
Party people say, party people say, "Aye
It's a new day, it's a new day"
While it's gettin' ready, everybody's ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say

[Outro]
Celebrate and say
Celebrate and say
Celebrate and say

[Verse 1]
If everybody had an ocean
Across the U.S.A
Then everybody'd be surfin'
Like Californi-a
You'd see them wearing their baggies
Huarache sandals too
A bushy bushy blond hairdo
Surfin' U.S.A

[Chorus]
You'd catch 'em surfin' at Del Mar
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
Ventura County line
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
Santa Cruz and Trestles
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
Australia's Narrabeen
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
All over Manhattan
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
And down Doheny Way
(Inside, outside)

[Hook]
Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A

[Verse 2]
We'll all be planning that route
We're gonna take real soon
We're waxing down our surfboards
We can't wait for June
We'll all be gone for the summer
We're on surfari to stay
Tell the teacher we're surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A

[Chorus]
Haggerties and Swamis
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
Pacific Palisades
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
San Onofre and Sunset
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
Redondo Beach LA
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
All over La Jolla
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
At Wa'imea Bay
(Inside, outside)

[Hook]
Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A

Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A

Yeah everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A

Yeah everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A

[Verse 1]
My song is love
Love to the loveless shown
And it goes on
You don't have to be alone

[Verse 2]
Your heavy heart
Is made of stone
And it's so hard to see you, clearly
You don't have to be on your own
You don't have to be on your own

[Chorus]
And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
Can I get that message home?

[Verse 3]
My song is love
My song is love unknown
But I'm on fire for you, clearly
You don't have to be alone
You don't have to be on your own

[Chorus]
And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
And I'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home

[Bridge]
And I'm not gonna stand and wait
I'm not gonna leave it until it's much too late
On a platform, I'm gonna stand and say
That I'm nothing on my own
And I love you, please come home

[Outro]
My song is love, is love unknown
And I've got to get that message home

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

[Chorus: Chris Martin with Will Champion]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth

[Chorus: Chris Martin with Will Champion]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Breakdown: Chris Martin, Jonny Buckland, Guy Berryman & Will Champion]
Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face, and I
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face, and I

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Intro]
(One, two)

[Verse 1]
Steal my heart and hold my tongue
I feel my time, my time has come
"Let me in, unlock the door"
I've never felt this way before

[Bridge]
And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummer begins to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know which way I've come

[Verse 2]
Hold my head inside your hands
I need someone who understands
I need someone, someone who hears
For you, I've waited all these years

[Chorus]
For you I'd wait 'til kingdom come
Until my day, my day is done
And say you'll come and set me free
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me

[Verse 3]
In your tears and in your blood
In your fire and in your flood
I hear you laugh, I heard you sing
I wouldn't change a single thing

[Bridge]
And the wheels just keep on turning
The drummers begin to drum
I don't know which way I'm going
I don't know what I've become

[Chorus]
For you I'd wait 'til kingdom come
Until my day, my day is done
And say you'll come and set me free
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me

[Intro: Big Sean, Mac Miller, Big Sean & Mac Miller]
I do it, I do
True players what we is, man, true players don't dissolve (Boy)
Hey, uh, true players what we is and true players don't dissolve (It's B.I.G. Sean Don, uh, uh)
Motherfucker (Mac, my boy)
(Fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you) Some shit to ride to
Oh, God

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Now gimme everything I ask for or end up in a cast, ho
Never slowin' down, that's why I'm gettin' paid fast-forward
Standin' on my money, that's a cash flow (Oh)
Smokin' medical, sippin' chemical, I need a labcoat
From where they livin' off food stamps, that's past poor
Thought about it as I got a stamp in my passport (Yeah)
Yeah, I made it out, made it up, and I'll remain makin' it up
Never satisfied with what I make, no such thing as makin' enough ('Nough)
Bitch, I'm livin' like it's Monopoly (Yeah)
Tryna dodge jail and I'm buyin' up the property (Yeah)
Yo' wifey was down with monogamy, til' she started massagin' me
But you can't have a dollar, ho, blame it on the economy
A young player at the tip-top
Bitch niggas hatin', bad bitches wanna lip-lock (Woah)
I could show you the ropes since I got the game in a slipknot
From a city of G's, I'm just the one that was picked out (Ya)

[Chorus: Big Sean & Mac Miller]
Wake up in the morning, first thing I need is my paper, paper, paper, paper
Ya might pass out and die if ya try and match my labor, labor, labor, labor
Man, every time they see me, they say, "Boy, whatcha doin'? (Woah)
Boy, whatcha doin'? Boy, boy, whatcha doin'?" (Uh-huh)
Bitch, I'm tryna build a hundred dollar bill skyscraper, scraper, scraper (Uh)
Stackin' my paper

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Bitch, unzip my pants 'fore you try and take 'em off
Open wide, say, "Ah," then you cough
See, I got so many shows, think it's a season of Lost
Get money, uniform, you can see I'm on my job
Ah damn, bitch, you better stand in your lane
All my jams are so insane, you just Danity Kane
Straight pussy, and no balls
Rockin' jeans and thug sandals, that's a faux pas
Have 'em all like (Oh, God) every time we showin' off
True players what we is and true players don't dissolve
They evolve into a Gotti, was illa then you thought you was
Now we in Bugattis ridin' shotty when we shoppin' for some good shit
I don't claim no hood shit
But I guarantee you I ain't on that Hollywood shit
Hey, unless it's chillin' up at Holiday Hills
And that's sixteen bars, all of 'em ill, what?

[Bridge: Big Sean & Mac Miller]
Say, say, say
True players what we is and true players don't dissolve
True players what we is, man, true players don't dissolve
Said, true players what we is and true players don't dissolve
Uh, true players what we is and true players don't dissolve
(They say, they say, okay)
True players what we is, man, true players don't dissolve
I said, true players what we is and true players don't dissolve at all

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Wake up in the morning, first thing I need is my paper, paper, paper, paper
Ya might pass out and die if ya try and match my labor, labor, labor, labor
Man, every time they see me, they say, "Boy, whatcha doin'? (Woah)
Boy, whatcha doin'? Boy, boy, whatcha doin'?" (Uh-huh)
Bitch, I'm tryna build a hundred dollar bill skyscraper, scraper, scraper
Stackin' my paper

[Intro]
NIGGAS!

[Verse]
The wolves are coming with their guns
You better run Samuel, run
And we can hear them motherfuckas come
You better run
The wolves are coming with them Ak-40s

[Bridge]
Run (here they come)
(x5)

[Hook]
Samuel is dead
(he's dead, he's dead)
(x2)

[Verse 1]
I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong, I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love, but
If I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you

[Chorus]
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

[Verse 2]
I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally, could this be it, or?

[Chorus]
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere? Yeah

[Breakdown]
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Waves of violet go crashing and laughing
The rainbow-winged singing birds fly 'round the sun
Sun bells rain down in a liquid profusion
Mermaids on porpoises draw up the dawn

What's become of the baby
This cold December morning?

Songbirds
Frozen in their flight
Drifting to the earth
Remnants of forgotten dreaming
(calling...)
Answer comes there none
Go to sleep you child
Dream of never-ending always

Panes of crystal
Eyes sparkle like waterfalls
Lighting the polished ice caverns of Khan
But where in the looking-glass fields of illusion
Wandered the child who was perfect as dawn?
What's become of the baby
This cold December morning?

Racing
Rhythms of the sun
All the world revolves
Captured in the eye of Odin
Allah
Pray, where are you now?
All Mohammed's men
Blinded by the sparkling water
Scheherazade gethering stories to tell
From primal gold fantasy petals that fall
But where is the child
Who played with the sun chimes
And chased the cloud sheep
To the regions of rhyme?

Stranded
Cries the south wind
Lost in the regions of lead
Shackled by chains of illusion
Delusions of living and dead

[Verse 1]
Sunlight opened up my eyes
To see for the first time, it opened them up
And tonight rivers will run dry
Not for the first time rivers will run

[Verse 2]
Hundreds of years in the future
There could be computers looking for life on Earth
Don't fight for the wrong side
Say what you feel like
Say how you feel

[Chorus]
You go backwards but then you go forwards again
You go backwards but then you go

[Verse 3]
Created, then drilled and invaded
If somebody made it, someone will mess it up
And you are not wrong to
Ask who does this belong to
It belongs to all of us

[Chorus]
You go backwards but then you go forwards again
You go backwards but then you go forwards
You go backwards but then you go forwards again
You go backwards but then you go forwards

[Verse 1]
The cash machine is blue and green
For a hundred in twenties and a small service fee
I could spend three dollars and sixty-three cents
On Diet Coca-Cola and unlit cigarettes
I wonder why we listen to poets when nobody gives a fuck
How hot and sorrowful, this machine begs for luck

[Refrain]
All my lies are always wishes
I know I would die if I could come back new

[Verse 2]
I want a good life with a nose for things
Fresh wind and bright sky to enjoy my suffering
A hole without a key if I break my tongue
Speaking of tomorrow, how will it ever come?

[Refrain]
All my lies are always wishes
I know I would die if I could come back new

[Bridge]
I'm down on my hands and knees every time the doorbell rings
I shake like a toothache when I hear myself sing

[Refrain]
All my lies are only wishes
I know I would die if I could come back new

[Outro]
I would like to salute
The ashes of American flags
And all the fallen leaves
Filling up shopping bags

[Verse 1: Jerry Garcia & Phil Lesh]
Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garland in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes, the people all complain

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia & Phil Lesh]
Stephen prospered in his time
Well he may and he may decline
Did it matter? Does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3: Jerry Garcia & Phil Lesh]
Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to Hell
Hell halfway 'twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down
And lower down again

[Bridge: Jerry Garcia & Phil Lesh]
Ladyfinger dipped in moonlight
Writing "What for?" across the morning sky
Sunlight splatters dawn with answers
Darkness shrugs and bids the day good-bye
Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet covers, call it your own

[Verse 4: Jerry Garcia & Phil Lesh]
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia & Phil Lesh]
Saint Stephen will remain
All he's lost he shall regain
Seashore washed by the suds and foam
Been here so long he's got to calling it home

[Outro: Jerry Garcia & Phil Lesh]
Fortune comes a-crawling, Calliope woman
Spinning that curious sense of your own
Can you answer? Yes I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man?

[Verse 1]
When I was just a little young boy
Papa said "son, you'll never get far
I'll tell you the reason if you want to know
'Cause child of mine, there isn't really very far to go"

[Verse 2]
Well baby, baby wants a gold diamond ring
Wants it more than most any old thing
Well when I get those jelly roll blues
Why I'd go and get anything in this world for you

[Verse 3]
Down to the jewelry store packing a gun
Says, "Wrap it up. I think I'll take this one"
"A thousand dollars please," the jewelry man said
Dupree he said, "I'll pay this one off to you in lead"

[Chorus]
Well, you know son you just can't figure
First thing you know you're gonna pull that trigger
And it's no wonder your reason goes bad -
Jelly roll will drive you stone mad

[Verse 4]
Judge said, "Son, this gonna cost you some time"
Dupree said, "Judge, you know that crossed my mind"
Judge said, "Fact it's gonna cost you your life"
Dupree said, "Judge, you know that seems to me to be about right"

[Verse 5]
Well baby, baby's gonna lose her sweet man
Dupree come out with a losing hand
Baby's gonna weep it up for awhile
Then go on out and find another sweet man's
Gonna treat her with style

[Verse 6]
Judge said "son, I know your baby well
But that's a secret I can't never tell"
Dupree said "judge, well it's well understood
And you got to admit that that sweet, sweet jelly's so good"

[Chorus]
Well you know son you just can't figure
First thing you know you're gonna pull that trigger
And it's no wonder your reason goes bad
Jelly roll will drive you stone mad

[Verse 7]
Same old story and I know it's been told
Some like jelly jelly - some like gold
Many a man's done a terrible thing
Just to get baby that shiny diamond ring

[Verse]
Boots were of leather
A breath of cologne
Her mirror was a window
She sat quite alone

All around her
The garden grew
Scarlet and purple
And crimson and blue

She came and she went
And at last went away
The garden was sealed
When the flowers decayed

On the wall of the garden
A legend did say:
No one may come here
Since no one may stay

[Verse 1]
Sitting in Mangrove Valley chasing light-beams
Everything wanders from baby to Z
Baby, baby, pretty, young on Tuesday
Old like a rum drinking demon at tea
Baby, baby, tell me what's the matter
Why, why tell me, what's your why now?
Tell me why will you never come home?
Tell me what's your reason if you got a good one

[Chorus]
Everywhere I go
The people all know
Everyone's doing that rag
Everyone's doing that rag

[Verse 2]
Take my line go fishing for a Tuesday
Maybe take my supper, eat it down by the sea
Gave my baby twenty, forty good reasons
Couldn't find any better ones in the morning at three
Rain gonna come but the rain gonna go, you know
Stepping off sharply from the rank and file
Awful cold and dark like a dungeon
Maybe get a little bit darker 'fore the day

[Chorus]
Hipsters, tripsters
Real cool chicks, sir
Everyone's doing that rag
Everyone's doing that rag

[Verse 3]
You needn't gild the lily, offer jewels to the sunset
No one is watching or standing in your shoes
Wash your lonely feet in the river in the morning
Everything promised is delivered to you
Don't neglect to pick up what your share is
All the winter birds are winging home now
Hey Love, go and look around you
Nothing out there you haven't seen before now

[Chorus]
But you can wade in the water
And never get wet
If you keep on doing that rag
If you keep on doing that rag

[Verse 4]
One eyed jacks and the deuces are wild
The aces are crawling up and down your sleeve
Come back here, Baby Louise
And tell me the name
Of the game that you play

[Outro]
Is it all fall down?
Is it all go under?
Is it all go under?
Is it all go under?
Is it all go under?
Is it all go under?
Is it all go under?
Is it all go under?
Is it all go under?

[Refrain: Jerry Garcia]
Cold mountain water, the jade merchant's daughter
Mountains of the moon, Electra bow and bend to me
Hi ho the carrion crow, fol de rol de de riddle
Hi ho the carrion crow, bow and bend to me

[Verse 1: Jerry Garcia]
Hey, Tom Banjo
Hey, a laurel
More than laurel you may sow
More than laurel you may sow
Hey, the laurel
Hey, the city in the rain
Hey, hey, hey, the wild wheat waving in the wind

[Bridge: Jerry Garcia]
Twenty degrees of solitude, twenty degrees in all
All the dancing kings and wives assembled in the hall
Lost is the long and loneliest town
Fairy sybil flying
All along the—
All along the mountains of the moon

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia]
Hey, Tom Banjo
It's time to matter
The earth will see you on through this time
The earth will see you on through this time
Down by the water
Marsh King's daughter
Did you know?
Clothed in tatters, always will be
Tom, where did you go?

[Refrain: Jerry Garcia]
Mountains of the moon, Electra, mountains of the moon
All along the—
All along the mountains of the moon
Hi ho the carrion crow, fol de rol de de riddle
Hi ho the carrion crow, bow and bend to me

[Outro: Jerry Garcia]
Bend to me
Na da da da da da da da da da da da

[Verse]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back
Comic book colors on a violin river crying leonardo
Words from out a silk trombone

I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Verse 1]
Cosmic Charlie, how do you do?
Trucking in style along the avenue
Dum de dum de doodley do
Go on home your mamas calling you

[Verse 2]
Kalico, kahlia, come tell me the news
Calamity's waiting for a way to get to her
Rosy red and electric blue
I bought you a paddle for your paper canoe

[Verse 3]
Say you'll come back when you can
Whenever your airplane happens to land
Maybe I'll be back here too
It all depends on what's with you

[Verse 4]
Hung up waiting for a windy day
Kite one ice since the first of February
Mama keeps saying that the wind might blow
But standing here I say I just don't know

[Verse 5]
New ones coming as the old ones go
Everything's moving here but much too slow now
A little bit quicker and we might have time
To say, "How do you do?" before we're left behind

[Verse 6]
Calliope wail like a seaside zoo
The very last lately inquired about you
It's really very one or two
The first you wanted, the last I knew

[Verse 7]
I just wonder if you shouldn't feel
Less concerned about the people unreal
The very first word is, "How do you do?"
The last go home your mamas calling you
Calling you, calling you, calling you, calling you

[Outro]
Go on home your mama's calling you
Go on home your mama's calling you
Go on home your mama's calling you
Go on home your mama's calling you

[Verse 1]
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

[Verse 2]
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

[Bridge]
I know you haven’t made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I’ve known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

[Verse 3]
I’d go hungry, I’d go black and blue
I’d go crawling down the avenue
There’s nothing that I wouldn’t do
To make you feel my love

[Bridge]
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

[Verse 4]
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn’t do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love

[Intro]
Give me that bass, make it bang
Boom, boom

[Verse 1]
Cruising down town with me and my crew
Girls on the sidewalk, how do you do?
I like your bass, that’s something to screw
If you’re looking for a good time, follow the boom
Dip to the liquor store then to the crib
Knock on the door, damn look who it is
It’s the L.A. freaks with all that base
Ain't nothing like a hoochie with an 8o8

[Chorus: Far East Movement]
Pack that stump in, anything to trunk it
And girl is a basshead, let me see you pump it
Yeah, get wasted, to the, to the pavement
Let me see you pump it, girl you’re a basshead
Girl you’re a basshead, girl you’re a bass head
Let me see you pump it girl, you’re a basshead
Go girl you’re a bass head, yeah you’re a basshead
Let me see you pump it girl, you’re a basshead

[Verse 2]
Pop, pop, fizz, fizz
Take a sip, blacked out we the cool kids
Take a hit blacked out on a cool hit
Cross-faded all day on the new shit
Tripping out when the bass look real fat
She got a sub that can hit like a heart attack
Oh, girl got bass, with a nice shape
Nothing like a hoochie with an 8o8

[Chorus: Far East Movement]

So we gonna live it up like it's your birthday
Hypnotized, I could never take my eyes off you
Used to have a rack of honeys now you're all I do
Iced out coupe for your iced out boots
Going ham with my cheese, baby, cordon bleu

[Chorus 1]
This is my biography
It's really somethin' that you gotta read
You all are weak, words that make me fall asleep (Yo)
Dime nots, please, can you drop the beat? (Look, look)

[Verse 1]
Now, everybody, can you clap your hands?
When you hear this out the speakers, be like, "That's the jam"
And ask your mans if he'll please turn it up
And we can gather round the cypher while we burn a Dutch
Words rush out my mouth when it's my turn to bust
Try and challenge the battler, you herbs get crushed
'Cause you'll be smoked right away like the herb I puff
Steel City, put your hands up, the 'Burgh is us
Smokin' purple stuff, hold it down for the potheads
Cross the cat, he'll fill your body up with hot lead
I'm not sayin' what's not said before
Takin' words out the book and I'm makin' metaphors
'Cause I ('Cause I)

[Chorus 2]
I gotta, gotta, gotta make money
Even if I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta take money
And it's what they take from me why I gotta do
Handle your business before it handle you
I gotta, gotta, gotta make money
Even if I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta take money
And it really ain't funny what I gotta do
Handle your business before it handle you

[Verse 2]
We all tryna be rich, man, it's all for the cash
Whether you slingin' trees or movin' 8-balls in the bag
Now from this jail cell where you callin' your dad
Sayin' you droppin' out of class and you followin' rap
So don't worry 'bout the cops, dad, I hate the feds
I'ma make it, Pops, try not to hang your head
'Cause I spit so sick that I should stay in bed
I'ma keep makin' bread 'til I'm layin' dead
I'm collectin' dollars, and quarters, and nickels, and dimes
My hat turned upside down while I'm kickin' a rhyme
I'm sittin' reclined, y'all claim real but you all sound fake
All for the money, fam, all for the pound cake
And when I get rich, I won't forget about my family
I'll be spreadin' money all throughout the whole family tree
The words I speak with herbs and trees about the currency
I gotta make money 'fore the dollar bill murder me

[Chorus 2]
I gotta, gotta, gotta make money
Even if I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta take money
And it's what they take from me why I gotta do
Handle your business before it handle you
I gotta, gotta, gotta make money
Even if I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta take money
And it really ain't funny what I gotta do
Handle your business before it handle you

[Chorus 1]
This is my biography
It's really somethin' that you gotta read
You all are weak, words that make me fall asleep
Dime nots, please, can you drop the beat?

[Chorus 2]
I gotta, gotta, gotta make money
Even if I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta take money
And it's what they take from me why I gotta do
Handle your business before it handle you
I gotta, gotta, gotta make money
Even if I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta take money
And it really ain't funny what I gotta do
Handle your business before it handle you
Stampede box flow make the beat bleed
Punch tummies cause I'm Young Money’s G.E.D
Queen come work for me or it's back to Burger King
Burglar be hurtin' me, Tim Burton couldn't horror me
All you niggas bumblebees bustin' off these bigger beasts
Eat 'em up, got them niggas on the lumidee
Get ready to rumble afro thunder, hype off a bitch tell her to buy a puzzle
Speak nothing new single comin' sucka’s , girls fuck us keep on my polo’s and black tucka’s
The black chucky you get lumped up or pay money
No play money we cleaned up and called it made money
Hate money burnin' to the scown now its aids money
Lay hundreds on the floor couldn't catch me slippin from it
I be be super on it I could put the house up on it
If you want it come and get it
Better catch up homie, red mustard muscle Ferrari through this jungle yellow seat buckled nice I ain’t slowin down for nothin'
Milf hunter wheres the fresh titty milf motha what would you do for a young black marksummers
Uhmmmmm think about it women Tyga can put my man in your lil' women
Born little coverin it, coverin it with a rubber
I don't trust a bitch see how mother nature is
In the club rainin' big with the lime in my drink n' mix it with the twist

[Interlude]
Little bird, have you got a key?
Unlock the lock, Inside of me

[Verse 1: Far East Nation]
Ya, I had a dream baby, you could get high off me
You could fly for free, If I save you babe
Would you light the street that's inside of me
Can't breathe baby, no you can't feel your feet
Cause this ain't that dream ain't it
Bird you're too high to see that the high is me

[Chorus: Far East Movement]
And all my life I've been living for love

Wouldn't creep out for that dime one more time
Only lay asleep, Cause this ain't that dream ain't it
Bird you're too high to see that the high is me

[Chorus: Far East Movement]
And all my life I've been living for love

[Verse 3: Far East Movement]
Yeah, nothing what it seems, baby girl's just a fiend
When she come down it was all a dream
Best believe, cause it ain't worth the steam
Little bird don't clip your wings
I figure when you get down do you get low?
Maybe you should quit now when it felt true
Either way we know what we got worth more than dough
When you're high don't fly alone

[Chorus: Far East Movement]
And all my life I've been living for love
Hold me down, I'mma hold you up
When it go down, I'mma get my love
Cause you just can't get enough

[Verse 1: LMFAO]
She never been on a flight
She never been in a limousine
And now she's living the life
Popping bottles in Italy
She's dancing up on the table
Got everybody's attention in here
She put my hands on her body
And then she whispers in my ear

[Chorus: Eva Simmons]
This is the best night of my life

[Verse 3: GoonRock]
You never know how it's gonna go
When you bring a chick up in the limousine
Seeing things she's never seen
And you walk up in the club, straight holding her hand, like you're the man
But deep in your heart, you know she's a fan
Cause she's struck by the stars
And the stars find her striking
You try to play it off cause you see a sign of frightening
Will.I.Am is spitting at her
T-pain's winking at her
Ludacris is with his chick but his homeboys getting at her

What's the matter? Oh nothing
I reply straight, but fronting, wrapped in bottles, started chucking
She grabbed my hand, pulled me to the dancefloor
We dance close, and then she put my hands low

Oh, I know where this is gonna go
I've seen it in a dream before
I love it when you hold me tight
And then we kiss 'til the morning light

[Pre-Chorus: Eva Simmons]
This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Can last forever

Yellow bitch wear gold jewels
New bitch, drive old school
Them bitches hate like, "Who you?"
You ain't shit, you boo-boo
I gets mine and take yours
Shitting what I made for
Touring, bitch, I give it dawg
Tell her that I said, "I did it, dawg"
Yellow bitch, all night
Yellow bitch, all right

All the homies sell white

He 'bout it, 'bout it
He hit it, hit it
Can't live without it, 'out it
I'm in this dawg, treat that rap like it's my job
When my brahs fuck the cops, thirsty bitches acting pause
Don't be moving like you and I was friends or something
Cause I'm just doing me, rapping trying to spit something
I don't know you brah
Suck my clit, I don't owe you brahs
Gold skin bitch with the golden hair
Honey Cocaine to the fucking world, hey

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Fuck the world, came and gave her a baby
My car do 180, I'm losing sperm, I'm faded
Your girl ejaculate me, I'm horse riding that anal
This crazy shit I be saying insane, I'm Charles Manson
This motherfucker ain't landing
I'm landing on bitches' panties
That lambskin in the Lambo
Shoot up your leg, now you can't stand me (ha)
Pop up, pop up on you with cars you've seen in cartoons
I'm like f-f-f-fuck you, cause you, ain't got nothing to lose
Funny, Adam Sandler
I cover my back with mammals
They judge me, don't need a panel
You gossip too much; E channel
W-w-why you all up on me?
I thought I told you don't call me
My cousins, they see me shining
Now they're all begging for diamonds
I, I'm just good with this rhyming
Rolex, that's perfect timing
Might change my name to Muhammad
Like Ali, she call me Papi (ah)
Don't want more problems
I just want more money
Two house bunnies to keep the king company (ha)

[Verse 1]
I decree today that life
Is simply taking and not giving
England is mine, it owes me a living
But ask me why and I'll spit in your eye
Oh ask me why and I'll spit in your eye
But we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
No, we cannot cling to those dreams

[Refrain]
Does the body rule the mind
Or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...

[Chorus]
Under the iron bridge we kissed
And although I ended up with sore lips
It just wasn't like the old days anymore
No, it wasn't like those days
Am I still ill?
Ohh...
Oh, am I still ill?
Ohh...

[Refrain]
Does the body rule the mind
Or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno...

[Verse 2]
Ask me why and I'll die
Oh ask me why and I'll die
And if you must go to work tomorrow
Well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
For there are brighter sides to life
And I should know because I've seen them
But not very often

[Chorus]
Under the iron bridge we kissed
And although I ended up with sore lips
It just wasn't like the old days anymore
No, it wasn't like those days
Am I still ill?
Ohh...
Oh, am I still ill?
Ohh...

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & (Lil Jon)]
Tonight feels like we can do anything we like, oh
Tonight feels like the best night of my life

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
Hey, put your palms on the ceiling
Nobody move, nobody get shot
Next rounds on me
I love a hot mami when she around on me
So I never get enough of yelling, ven aqui
Officer on duty, J.Lo what they call her
Take me to jail, 'cause I wanna be your robber
Put me in a cell if you really need to holler
Put me in a cell, feet down, Flo Rida, hey
To the sky, put your hands on rock
Plus nobody telling please that the club is mi casa
Shorty want a freak, I'm the one you call papa
Got to make them sing high notes like opera
When the ego, I got four leo
Even the DJ, wanna rep Puerto Rico
Got it on replay, like you just broke a needle
Whatever that he say, better listen up people

[Outro: Jennifer Lopez]
Tonight, feels like
Tonight, feels like, the best night of my life
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in, hey!

[Verse 1]
It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on

[Verse 2]
But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm gonna make a lot of money
Then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

[Chorus]
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby cry

[Verse 3]
He tried hard to help me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on

[Verse 4]
I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby
That I ever had
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

[Chorus]
I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye

[Verse 1]
It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

[Intro]
"Eins, zwei, drei, alle!"
Ooh-ooh, you cannot reach me now
Ooh-ooh, no matter how you try
Goodbye, cruel world, it's over
Walk on by

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come (Worms to come)
In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
Testing. One. Two. One. Two. We’re all going to convene at 1:15 outside Brixton Town Hall where we will be going...

[Hook: Roger Waters]
(Waiting) To cut out the deadwood
(Waiting) To clean up the city
(Waiting) To follow the worms
(Waiting) To put on a black shirt
(Waiting) To weed out the weaklings
(Waiting) To smash in their windows and kick in their doors
(Waiting) For the final solution to strengthen the strain
(Waiting) To follow the worms
(Waiting) To turn on the showers and fire the ovens
(Waiting) For the queers and the coons and the reds and the Jews
(Waiting) To follow the worms

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Would you like to see Britannia Rule again
My friend?
All you have to do is follow the worms
Would you like to send our coloured cousins home again
My friend?
All you need to do is follow the worms

[Verse 1]
It's getting later baby, and I'm getting curious
Nobody's looking at us, I feel delirious
'Cause the beat penetrates my body
Shaking inside my bones
And you're pushing all my buttons
Taking me out of my zone, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
The way that you stare, starts the fire in me
Come up to my room, you sexy little thing
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing

You wanna make me chase you, like it's a compliment
But let's get right down to it

You wanna come and get me outta my dress, oh

Rollin' up to the club on the weekend
Styling out to the beat that you're freakin'

Hey, little mama like "Really, really, is that him?"
I done seen you before, what you got on them big rims?
Enter that cash flow, I'm like, baby, you don't trip
So shawty, say hand over your signature right here
Like adjust the dotted line, and I'm supposed to sign
How she at it, a fanatic and I think it's goin' down
She so starstruck, the gal all stuck
I shoulda had an overdose, too many Starbucks
Ain't never seen a balla, paper that stack taller
Stunners who let the top back on the Chevy Impala
Hummers and all that, fully loaded with two spoilers
What did you call that when you showed up with two dollars?
But that's another chapter, son of a bachelor
All on me, just spotted a baby actor
Complete swagger, there go the dagger
Got what she wants, shawty happily ever after

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Space Cowboy]
I'm so starstruck
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up
I'm so, so starstruck
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up

Young money cash money
Fast life, one night

[ Hook: Birdman]
We did it all in one night
Same night, it’s one night
We moved it all in one night
The same night, over night
Took a flight, did it all in one night
Fuck a nigga bitch, all in one night
Took another trip, all in one night
Split a nigga’s shit, all in one night
Overnight, ship the same night
Pay the price, the same night
Hit him up, leave it since sunny bright
He rolled the dice, so he paid the price

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
I’m still the nigga off of Tchoupitoulas
I’m still funky like hustle new
Just don’t let ‘em take the call from Cuba
You saw me on the news but you know what I do
I was down, and nigga I don’t fuck around
Cuz I’m pound for pound and I’m blow for blow
Got another year for ’98, ‘99
Been gone since ‘04, got out on parole
Shit, rappin’ this man and nigga I don’t just kid, nigga got my spot
Still hard like a locked up cock
Simple but the same with a locked up pac
Come and behold, they open the gates so
Brace yourself big, about to shake up the block
Can’t just lock up the prince of the south
Came the time right you didn’t fuck with me
Put your mold on, slot ‘em, cold ‘em, hold ‘em
My shoulder gets cold in blood
I brought the motherfucker like it’s ape charge
I’m high enough to slide between the water
I’d give it to you but nah they don’t get it
I’m shovelin’ the gloves but hands don’t fit it
Take up a video and later get to know ‘em
Get the motherfucker for preaching to Levy
I taught that detainer. Artist, painter
Sweep that finger, bang ‘er
Cuz your motherfuckin’ head I’mma blow off
And your body hit the floor and the carpet stained
Have the nigga that you won a star should you go to war
But you’re more than a gruesome painter
When it come to rappin’ get some lollics and then put ‘em all together and use ‘em
Aha, I’m a fool with a tool, I’mma beast in the street
Put the fucker on the door but the law got feelin’ to the riddle lemme kill ‘em to the beat
Fuckin’ records, I’mma stab ‘em with them repper
Get the phone with the chrome and I’m lone with the bone
God dammit, I grudge when I bust ‘em
Three hoes with some dudes, they’re alone in the room
Better off gettin’ hit by a chain, ran over by a truck or fall of a house
Dare to fuck with me then my work, choke me on yourself ‘til you pass out
And the fuck I don’t get no shits, and you son of a bitch, you’d better watch your step
Hey, but the microphone’s stickin’ out your ass and the goddamn Corvette ‘round your neck
Bitch!
Stevie J

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
It is what it is, motherfucker what it is
We so YMCMB and the B stand for biz
Stand for bang, stand for Benzes
Stand for Bentleys, stand for Bugattis
Stand for bank, Rose bottles, beach life
Beat them hands with it, be like
Stunner, why they got me started? I was just chillin’ (word)
Now I gotta kill ‘em, bullets the size of chitlins
I got that old rapper clapper feel like I be in heaven
I send his ass to hell to dance to the devil’s rhythm
Never dropped a album but I got a pocket full of cash
So dear rappers, fuck you and your swag
I just came back from France, did 2 shows
Now the big face Rollies, I got 2 of those
Awards on my wall for my pen, I got a few of those
Some made niggas who paid, I got a crew of those
I used to dream about pornstars, now I’m screwin’ those
This YMC in business, fuck you think I do, what’s up?
(Hold up)

[Verse 3: Detail]
Talkin’ about, live for it
Her head good, can’t imagine what she did for
Let’s fuck tonight, baby bay
Yea tonight, cuz tomorrow is a workin’ day
Get it early baby cuz I’m blowin’ up
Maybe some time in the future I see just how you holdin’ up
Tell you nigga, you choose it now
Say you’re shiftin’ gears, cruise it now
Let me tell you something
I make beats, I lay tracks, I write hooks, I love God, I fuck bitches. Fact
Don’t take long, I’m all night
I’ll pick you up, you ball right
My applause is that I’m all in but I’m thinkin’ ‘bout gettin’ back
Get it all, man get it all
Never let that cup spill
I’m fresher than a motherfuckin’ shaker
Okay, our night is young and we on
Feel good and you hurt nigga
Cash money and young money
I’m ‘bout that, see the shirt nigga
The shirt nigga

[Hook]

Young money, cash money that’s right
We on top and we never gonna stop

Fogel!

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room
You know you made my eyes burn
It was like, James Dean, for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know

Let's go
Tell me what bad boys do
I'm a bad girl, if you into that one too
My American Dream in jeans all blue
Keep it cool like crushed ice cubes
It's you felonious in a foreign coupe
In the blue range across my view
Better crush like my cunt too
Ain't 'nough said about his moves
A real tough one, sometimes two
Bet you fine about lifetime sunshine boo
(Say you remember!)
Bananas and bow ties, whips and handcuffs
Tied down the club like living like gangsters
Both wanna die, love living in danger
Bodies all around, put it down like an
Anchor
(Say you remember!)
Hardcore bottles
Try more than just anger
Passion like fever
Hot like Jamaica
Real rude boy, no problem for later
Money on his mind 'bout getting his paper
Truth be told he's locked down with his flamer
Really like his flavor
Wanna slow dance with the devil
Click-lick, the look of an angel
Took a small chance with a rebel now my flesh is amazing
Now we shooting them lasers and laughin' at haters
Gangster's not bred I make them
Gangster's not dead I raise 'em
(Gangster)

[Bridge: Azealia Banks]
Gangster's not dead
Gangster's not bred I make them
Gangster's not dead I raise 'em

[Outro: Lana Del Rey]
Say you remember!
Say you remember!

Say you remember!

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda Chester Bennington]
Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for paths left alone
'Cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end
It's the worst kind of pain I've known

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Give up your heart, left broken
And let that mistake pass on
'Cause the love that you lost wasn't worth what it cost
And in time, you'll be glad it's gone

Misty morning, clouds in the sky
Without warning, a wizard walks by
Casting his shadow, weaving his spell
Long grey cloak, tinkling bell

[Chorus]
Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic

Evil power disappears
Demons worry when the wizard is near
He turns tears into joy
Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by

Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic

Sun is shining, clouds have gone by
All the people give a happy sigh
He has passed by, giving his sign
Left all the people feeling so fine

Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, Kendrick Lamar
This for the town, nigga

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Me, I'm from the Hub City, yeah, that Compton court building
Caught a murder when his homie died, judge caught feelings
I'm on Rosecrans, chilling right inside Best Outlest
Five dollar Little Caesar, momma shopped at Food-4-Less
Elementary McNair, say what's up to Vanguard
Centennial High, had me swimming with a pool of sharks
Me, I'm just a good kid, tryna keep it neutral
But I'm well aware that a square can get shot too
Most Crip and some Piru, that's just how the game go
Hood on every corner, stop for gas and get your brains blown
Bitches with fat asses, burning in the stashes
Murders in July, call that summer time madness
Rest in peace 4 Bent, rest in peace Mausberg
Swear to God, when I make it big, your voice'll be heard
Me, I'm just a good kid, tryna keep it positive
Though I know it's chaos, forever my heart will live in

[Chorus: Alori Joh]
Compton, concrete jungle
Where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in Compton
These streets will make you or break you
Expire or inspire you
Let's hear it for Compton
Compton, Compton

(Verse 2)
Take you back to Y.E.T it was just divining me
Earl had got disciplined for not catching a fade that week
Shit had made him stronger though, yeah those were the good old days
Eating Tam's burger while my Juvenile CD had played
21 outside maybe sideline pop
Yellow tape on sidewalk damn somebody got popped
Hoping that I live a lot, I don't want to die young
Please don't come shoot up my party, I just want to have fun
Sheriffs in my rear view, mother fuck the police
Pull me over just to plant an 8 ball on me
Fuck it though I'm out here, I've always been out here
Since the Compton swap meet, black and red LA gears
Pac was on Rosecrans nigga I was right there
Cali Love video he said whattup I said yeah
Free my nigga J-Dub and both of the J-Mans
Eazy paved the way, Lil Eazy bout to get it in for..
(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
I'm talking bout Westside Piru, N.H.P., Campanella, Carver Park
Front Hood, Nutty Blocc, Lantana, 151, Park Village
Cedar Block, Santana
Burgundy and Blue bandanas
Peace! Peace!
Fruit Town, Kelly Park, Southside, Elm Street

Me, I'm just a good kid hoping I can spread love
Word to the county building forever I do it for...

But I'm gon' make you say you love me
The way (Love the way), you look to me now (To me now)
We need to get down (Let's get down)
You don't know but I'm gon' make you say you love me, girl

[Verse 1]
I ain't never fell for a girl like you (Like you)
With jeans and a body that curves like you (Like you)
I don't really care what they say (Ooh), when it comes to a difference of age (Ooh)
I can show you all the things I'll do (I'll do)
Break your heart, never raise my voice
Girl, let down your guard
I know it's a lot to ask trust in me
But I can make a difference right now, you'll see

[Pre-Chorus]
Shorty, tell me why you tryna keep all the goodies from me?
Can't you see what you holding me, that does to me
Every time you walk past? Oh

[Chorus]
Ain't no way (Ain't no way) I'm gon' let you down (Let you down)
I know it's hard right now (Hard right now) to say yes to me
But I'm gon' make you say you love me
The way (Love the way), you look to me now (To me now)
We need to get down (Let's get down)
You don't know but I'm gon' make you say you love me, girl

[Verse 2]
For a minute can you just think about us two?
Swerving in my 645 SU
Me leaning over the seat (Ooh), I'm passing you your own set of keys (Ooh)
Showing you just how the teen got you
Trust and believe these words, from me been said before
Tricking ain't my M-O
But, girl, you represent everything
That Chris is about so, shawty, please

[Pre-Chorus]
Shorty, tell me why you tryna keep all the goodies from me? (Ooh)
Can't you see what you holding me, that does to me
Every time you walk past? Oh

[Chorus]
Ain't no way (Ain't no way) I'm gon' let you down (Let you down)
I know it's hard right now (Hard right now) to say yes to me
But I'm gon' make you say you love me
The way (Love the way), you look to me now (To me now)
We need to get down (Let's get down)
You don't know but I'm gon' make you say you love me, girl

[Bridge]
For you, girl, I'll buy you anything (For you, girl, I'll buy, everything to try)
Just to have you close to me (Girl, I know, I know)
'Cause you know your loving is off the wall
Don't even think about it, we'll take it slow (Don't even think about it, I'm gonna take it slow with ya, girl)
I ain't like the ones ya know (I'm not like the ones, gon' change)
I'm gonna make ya love me all night long (So come on and take a chance on me)

[Chorus]
Ain't no way (Ain't no way) I'm gon' let you down (Let you down)
I know it's hard right now (Hard right now) to say yes to me
But I'm gon' make you say you love me
The way (Love the way), you look to me now (To me now)
We need to get down (Let's get down)
You don't know but I'm gon' make you say you love me, girl

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Aye yo
Sing with an accent
Portuguese
See me wiggle the Porsche keys
Grapes, crackers, gorgeous cheese
Shifting gears left handed at mighty morphin' speeds
She suck me off while I torch the weed
She throw the drug in her butt
She hasn't shit for days
She chill with dykes from the state right where the Mystic play
"You got a nice white dick"
That's what the sistas say
Hit the switch then I switch the lane
Dipped 66 in grey
Lines, lines laying on my shoulder
Olive, olive green loafs covering my toes up
Loud, cover my clothes with that five wagon coke
I'm doper than a salsa singer's nose
Smoke somethin'

[Verse 2: Riff Raff]
Uh, Ruby Tuesday
Cinderella
Ballerina
Import important passports
Pasadena
Poppin' Fendi collars might be Berry Gordy
Pterodactyl dashboard
Seats, prehistoric
Dinosaur
Money cools the heart, but can't be too rude
Mind frame and attitude of a young Uncle Scrooge
You roody poo's get abused
Hulk Hogan
Ultimate Warrior
The eggs get boiled
Clash of the Titans
Conan the Destroyer
Turn tables with the young Clark Gable
Different mind fables
Syrup pours like maple
I'm watching cable
Plus my building marble housing structure
Prescription deductible
Rap game Dr.Huxtable

[Verse 3: Dana Coppafeel]
Check it
Yeah
I got that Kool Keith
That Ultramagnetic
Rhyme force like a lama spit
Electrifying
Just like a Blanka hit
They duckin' like the Gaza strip
No worries got it covered like Islamic chicks
I promise to body every beat
The hunger is bottomless
So peep game
But they fronted so you know that we can't follow it
It gets deep and you can tell the way
That she swallows dick
My brain is a lethal weapon
Tongue projects them hollow tips
The vision so vivid
Feeling like you might've lived it
But you didn't
You bit it the minute that we delivered it
Just admit it get the Medikit
Break it into two like subject and predicate
Coppa for president
"They say that love is blind, but I can see clearly when
I'm makin' love to you, lookin' you in your eyes
I see love has the greatest vision of all time. Yeah babe
How many of you are a living witness that love is real? Yeah babe
And how many of you know that love will be there for you
When you're up or when you're down?
And if you feel like I feel tonight, look at your lover and
Recite these words!"

Whoa my darlin', whoa my baby
How to describe it, I can't count the ways
I get a real good fellin', when I'm with you
What we got is something solid and no one can move
Fuss and fight, break up, through the night, we make up
I for you and you for me, we can get through anything
We could make the whole world sing

[Hook]
I believe, I believe that love is
Whoa you and me together for eternity
I believe that love is
Ups and downs, storm and rains
Through the joy and through the pain
Hey sweet lady, my everything
Girl let's get somewhere tonight and let our love rain
Cause I love what ya do, when you
Do what you do to me, girl
They can talk, but we're too strong
We're gonna let our love prove 'em wrong
Cause I for you and you for me, we could get through anything
We could make the whole world sing

[Hook]

Lovin' you is what I was put on this earth to do
Oh baby, first I was lonely, now girl I got you
I wanna spend the rest of my life thankin' heaven I found you

Love is
Whoa you and me together for eternity
I beieve that love is
Ups and downs, storm and rains
Through the joy and through the pain

[Intro]
"I can't believe you're playin' me like this
After all the love we shared
The good times we've had, remember, yeah"

Feels like it's over
My heart tells me she's in love with someone else
Gave me the cold shoulder
But it's her loss, cause I could find me somebody else
If she wanna hit the town and party all night with her friends
If she wanna fool around, woah
Then two can play that game baby

[Hook]
You got me feelin' single, 'bout to get out
Find somebody, who's gonna love me
Feelin' single, night is young
Hit the club, and take somebody home with me
Get it, get it, get it, get it
WE can get it baby get it, get it
Now that I'm single
She said forever
Turned out to be the biggest lie of all time
And she changed my weather, yeah
Rainin' all day, no chance of sunshine
If she wanna hit the town and party all night with her friends
If she wanna fool around, yeah
Then two can play that game baby

[Hook]

The way I see it you're not gonna do right
Oh by me baby girl
Then I might as well, then I might as well
I might as well get out and mingle
Cause you got, you got, you got me feelin' single

[Hook]
Where there's the sun, there is that girl
She is the one that spins my world
When I am down she makes it better
Where there are clouds, she change the weather
My wishing well, my peace and my glory
If there's a fairy tale then she is my story
When I feel drained her love is like a fountain
And when I'm weak, she can move mountains

[Hook]
I never felt a love no, this way
I never felt a kiss, no, this way
I never felt joy, this way
Till me lady sunday came

Oh I am her ground and she is my sky
If life is a road, then she is my ride

When I'm in pain, she's my good feeling
When I am sick she brings me healing
Whenever I call, she is right there
And when I fall, she says a prayer
When it comes to makin' love to me
She knows how to do it
Introducing Mrs. Music

[Hook]

Miss Godly, Miss Righteous, Miss Hallelujah
Take my hand and be my Mrs. Future
Cause your lovin', makes the groove much better
As long as we got music, as long as we got music
As long as we got music, we'll dance forever

[Hook]

I'm so glad that I could shout

[Verse 1]
Leave the coffin open when I go
Leave my pearls and lipstick on, so everybody knows
Pretty will be the photograph I leave
Laying down on famous knives, so everybody sees
Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
Someone I'll know could love and save me from myself

[Refrain]
Maybe I'll just clean the shit off of these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Di and die with you

[Chorus]
I wish that I was strong
I wish that I was wrong
I wish that I could cope
But I took pills and left a note

[Verse 2]
I'm hungry from an anorexic heart
I've been trying to tell you how I feel, but was never very smart
I'm wrapped in silks made for Egyptian queens
I'll do it in the swimming pool, so everybody sees
Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
Volumes I know will love and save me from myself

[Refrain]
Maybe I'll just keep clean the shit off of these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Di and die with you

[Bridge]
Princess die
I want to see her cry
Princess die
Princess die
We want to watch her cry
Princess die

[Chorus]
I wish that I was strong
I wish that I was wrong
I wish that I could cope
But I took pills and left a note

[Post-Chorus]
I wish that I could go in my rich boyfriend's limo
Right after he proposed with a 16-carat stone wrapped in rose gold
With the paparazzi all swarming around
In my Louis Vuitton white buttoned down
Oh, it's not that deep
So bob your head for another dead blonde whose real prince is in heaven
She just wants to sleep

[Outro]
The final act of life will be my own hands to do
I'll be a Princess Di and die with you
Applaud, approve

[Intro]
Ready to fuck

[Verse 1]
I'm rolling up in that gold thing
This bitch is at the door mane

Don't give my number, she know the name
That king shit that be my game
Ain't got a nigga, her ex lame

[Hook]
Don't it feel good?
Got you dripping down them thighs, then you gripping on the wheel

She said, "Don't it feel good?"
Then she riding on the top
She about to make it pop
She said, "Why you fucking everybody?"
I said, "Baby I be only fucking you"
She said, "Don't be fucking with nobody
I want you to myself and I want you, too"
So you know what I said

Your toes and your thighs shaking

She said I'm ready to fuck

[Verse 2]
Dealing with these bitches

And no nigga gon love you
How I loved you, Sally Blows

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]

Turn up the music, can I hear it 'til the speakers blow?
Turn up the music, fill your cup and drink it down

You know you make me laugh

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Flow so pneumonia, yo bitch want my boner
I take her 'round the corner then I gave the ho a bonus
Bitches wanna bone us, we ain't cubic zirconia
But I will never own 'em so to me them bitches loners
On the deck, and a tongue flip like the "my" in "My Sharona"
Got her drip, drip, drippin' like that lemon and Corona
Bank roll thick like that neck on Sabonis
But I will never trick, you just get dick and balonis
Take that tenderoni, and now she ride my pony
And cheese came with it like a snatch of pepperoni
I'm an O.G., I'm with CG
You a he-she, nigga run you back like a repeat
I'm a pill-poppin' ET, Givenchy on a ten-speed
Hot like Britney in '03, ya know me
Smokin' on that Toxic, sippin' on an O.E
Dippin' in that Molly got me higher than some Flow C

[Chorus: Britney Spears]
Too high, can't come down
Too high, can't come down
Too high, can't come down
Too high, can't come down

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Fandango my Mandingo, we should do a movie
Groupies lookin' like the Yakuza in my Jacuzzi
Excuse me I'm on that ooey, my pockets are life with Louis
Euros is different colors, my wallet look like a Coogi
He who speakin' the least is Chief Keefin' the peace
Leavin' seeds in yo niece, prayin' that she ain't late
Sprayin' like that AK, now that shit my namesake
'Bino you so nasty, ass like an ashtray
Smokin' Flying Lotus, used to be Jehovah's
I'm in yo girl and now she feeling Polish like pierogies
They hopin' that they smoke us
N'aw man, never that
Trippin' off that earwax, Danny Brown and D-Stacks
Ill pandemic, man that shit be everywhere
Midas is your highness and you Haribo like Gummi bears
Why I'm fly like a cockpit, you don't fly like a ostrich
Stupid shit like a mosh pit, can't believe this is "Toxic"

[Chorus: Britney Spears]
It's in the air and it's all around
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Too high, can't come down

[Intro: Chief Keef]
This is Royalty
Bang bang

[Verse 1: Gonage]
I got yo bitch layin' naked 'cross the bed, no rosary
Stackin' up this bread like a baker, Josephine
She wanna refill, so I get that ho a bean
Niggas on the sideline yellin' "Who the fuck is he?"
Bitch I'm @Gonage, you can call me Cody B
Wardrobe overseas, passports all over me
White leather seats lookin' like coca leaf
Every time I crank up the woofer sittin' on a key
I'm Gucci buckled up, house note on my feet
Linen button-up like I'm walkin' round on the beach
Blind hoes notice me in my Range Rover Jeep
So they wanna come and talk to me like Jodeci
Smokin' in the morning, and when I go to sleep
Blowin' presidential man, I think they 'about to vote for me
Any event we party like a frat, no toga sheet
If money ain't the convo, they ain't even 'posed to speak

[Chorus: Gonage]
If you ain't talkin' cash, don't say shit
In the VIP we champagne-spray shit
I'm in the club lookin' like a bank statement
If you talkin' cash, I can make arrangement
Walked in the club, ain't pay shit
Broke niggas hate, cause they ain't shit
I'm gettin' to the cash pockets on payment
If you talkin' money, I can make arrangement
Cody

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Cody Bean Senior, pushin' mean ether
You don't know Childish? Nigga, me neither
Eastside Atlanta, flyest nigga in a Waffle House
If it ain't money, man, we ain't got shit to talk about
Kennedy compound, my 20-room house
So big my ex-girls ain't gotta move out
If you ain't talkin' cash, don't say shit
My bank account looking like when little kids break shit—"Oooh!"
If I'm breathin' I can handle it
Watching all my dreams get together like an ampersand
Blueprint the new shit, mixtape management
Show these dummies how to do it, all I want's my ten percent
Porsche brand new, passed 'em a cool hundred
Yeah my girl 5'2", even her growth stunted
It's the nigga y'all knew back when I flipped meal cards
Now my meals free when I don't taste the fifth star
We can make arrangements, old money Cambridge
Meetin' with the moguls, make 'em richer and they owe you
It's the kid you used to talk about, I'm watchin' people get up on it
On Worldstar and I ain't have to have a nigga moment
Flow's always cold, keep the whole soul anemic
Never left that hard shit, a nigga's always constipated
Got the change for my cousin on froze, no more movin' weight
Flossin' hard, ice king, no more Finn and Jake
Love or hate you gotta say the hype is something handsome
As long as all of 'em bloggin' I'm living Richard Branson
Shit talk is still talk, haters are my billboard
Used to take the Q home, now I hang with ScHoolboy
So iconic, Black Kennedy this shit
Man I'm so ironic, man this ratchet need a fix
Droppin' new shit and the haters get the splashback
Don't be surprised when he ask you where the cash at

[Chorus: Gonage]
If you ain't talkin' cash, don't say shit
In the VIP we champagne-spray shit
I'm in the club lookin' like a bank statement
If you talkin' cash, I can make arrangement
Walked in the club, ain't pay shit
Broke niggas hate, cause they ain't shit
I'm gettin' to the cash pockets on payment
If you talkin' money, I can make arrangement
Cody

[Intro: Childish Gambino]
Somebody tell they people what the fuck is up
I'm grindin' like a doozer looking cool as fuck
I'm grindin' I'm most hated but I sell the stage
I'm grindin' I'm most hated but I'm gettin' paid

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Eddy Scissorhands is workin' on my linin' (woo!)
Gettin' spiffy for these bitches I be eyeing
Fredward Mercury was playin' while I'm ridin' (oh!)
Down the Ryan, in a Scion (yeah)
And I'm flyin', but it's cool, I got insurance
On the run, because I got warrants (ayy)
But it's cool I got endurance
In school I got suspended, but in turn I got some earnings
Could've spent it all on Thursday, but I saved it for my parents
But I spent a bit on Friday, in the night I hang with Donald
And I'm tired of McDonald's, want a chick that cook Chicano
That can't speak a lick of English
And pronounce my name like "Chano"
She say "something, something" Spanish
I look back like, "Bitch, I-I know"
Toni-i-ight, I'mma make decisions for li-i-ife
Take some Lucys, Boomers
Dark liq' and lights, I might dri-i-ive
That's that shit right there that I don't li-i-ike
There, that shit, just had to say
Shouts to the niggas that passed away
And shouts for the niggas that's here right now
And shots at the niggas that got away
So sad to say, but it's all good
Niggas gon' celebrate, and wait for the day
And wait for the day shit detonate, with Alizé
Like live from the Chi', it's Saturday ni-i-ight

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Used to have some patience, now it's all gone
Force feed these motherfuckers eatin' foie gras
Force feed these motherfuckers not a rockstar
I'm a say my piece, these other rappers lockjaw
I don't think they like me (I don't think they like me)
I don't think I'm icy, I think I'm aight, B
Niggas wanna fight me? That's unnecessary
I don't quit for shit, that's my legendary

[Outro: Sample]
Oh, I think dey like me, oh I think dey like me
Oh, I think dey like me, oh I think dey like me
Oh, I think dey like me, oh I think dey like me
Oh, I think dey like me, oh I think dey like me

[Verse 1]
Fiji water and a box of old Raisinets
I got a real taste for dyin' but I ain't do it yet
I tried to watch The Artist with my girlfriend
But instead, I lost the battle with some Nyquil
Playing Double Dribble with my older cousin
Now I'm ballin' every day so dude that's gotta stand for something
But it doesn't change the subject
Man, I'm hustlin', sandals cuttin' up
My ankles, please and thank you
Demons hate you when you angel
Never been to prison, but I serve a sentence
Grind—grind, when you—
I'm sharin' experiments with Seventh Day Adventists
And on the seventh day, I'mma show y'all what the event is
Dollar signs, bottom line
Speak the truth and everybody gon' hate you
Unless it's funny
That's how I used to make money
I don't roll with the old, yeah they want something from me
Why the flow so dummy, why do hoes still love me?
I don't know, don't bug me
On patron or bubbly or power, old culture
Ain't nobody sober
My mama don't drink but she kill me over soda
Damn homie, man you famous like Kony
My cousin bang Camp man (my cousin bang Camp man)
ATLienated myself about a month
Just enough to get, to get my rows in a duck
Just enough to make a faithful man wanna fuck
Girls be tweetin' me their pictures, man I gotta look
And most of 'em couldn't handle the panels in my comic's book
This rapper's book, this writer's book
They kinda shook, it's not a hook
They kinda shook, it's not a hook

[Interlude]
There's an edge to the wind
Cutting into my skin
And the air's like an icicle
As the night starts to fall

[Outro]
Uh, no excuses or apologies
Ain’t no way in hell they ain’t gon' say that I ain't body this
I be killing every nigga breathing bronchitis's
Ain’t no way in hell they ain’t gon' say that I ain't body this
Let ‘em know
Uh, no excuses or apologies
Ain’t no way in hell they ain’t gon' say that I ain't body this
I be killing every nigga breathing bronchitis's
I be killing every nigga breathing bronchitis's
Let 'em know

Oh, this is the idea where you're doing, like, one piece of artwork per track
That's dope

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Late ass nights come from long days
Doin' all the right things in the wrong ways
Doin' all the wrong shit for the right reasons
Sprinklin' midnight game, call it night seasoning
Haters get salty give 'em cholesterol
Trill O.G, mop up the floor with the best of y'all
Then dry that bitch off with the rest of y'all
And catch a flight to Rio de Janero for la festival
Yeah, and that's word to fit a baldy
Ball hard like it's cement inside of my Spalding
And I'll break your face with a no look pass
Now back to your parking lot pimp with yo little hook ass
I use harsh words cause these are hard times
And trill-ass people, nowadays they're such a hard find
So it's one eye open if I could peep ‘em
And one on the scope, so if they frontin' I can sleep 'em
Man, my flow is so parabolic
The energy'll blow you over even if you're brolic
Goddamn it, now that's one for the Googlers
That fell sleep on they desk and never step their noodle up
Takin' lames out never been new to us
The hardest part of this shit is figurin' which of you to bust
Then step your weight up like GNC
And R.I.P. to Chris Luda reppin' CNC
Straight G

[Chorus: Lovefoxxx]
There's somethin' inside you
It's hard to explain
They're talking about you boy
But you're still the same
There's somethin' inside you
It's hard to explain
They're talking about you boy
But you're still the same

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Rest in peace to them niggas who was dead wrong
Toni Braxton to them niggas, that's a sad song
Cry a river Timberlake, the whole industry
Record the whole album in my living room in Italy
Niggas who wasn't feelin' me secretly want a handout
Keep your mouth shut, I can probably help your man out
Drop a new stack all lames get to steppin'
Drop a new track all blogs go to heaven
Kill the web, man these niggas need they hits up
Kiss her neck, add a dime to the tip cup
She is not "slut," fuck a dude who says so
Just because she's fuckin' doesn't mean she ain't a lady
Kill the whole stage, I never needed a mic check
Semen on my spacebar, fuckin' tired of Skype sex
Runnin' with a new breed, me and Bun B
This hip-hop nation, that big country
Nigga, please! We ain't stop for no one
Wu-Tang Generator name, I'm a shōgun
Wu-Tang Generator name, watch him smoke one
Talk a lot of shit, but none of them will approach him
Gambino got first position, the game is ballet
So graceful; drive, he don't need a valet
So angel: fly as I wanna be
Mercy, somebody show these niggas can't hurt me
Woah

[Chorus: Lovefoxxx]
There's somethin' inside you
It's hard to explain
They're talking about you boy
But you're still the same
There's somethin' inside you
It's hard to explain
They're talking about you boy
But you're still the same

[Intro: RZA]
Digital, Childish Gambino
Mixtape demonstrations

[Verse 1: RZA]
This Oxycontin carbon monox' and toxic concoction
Collapse your brain cells, they swell from lack of oxygen
Leave the opposition stuck, without a pot to piss in
Hockin', spitting up blood, shark by sharp precision
Dart incision, darkness imparts your vision
Sparks infliction, (Poof) I'm a mad magician
Verbal plasma, verbal scatter, words that shatter
Every atom in your body, now you're anti-matter
Ripping through the data, checked into the doctor
Took his rhyme splatter, cause my mind's faster
You falling down to ground, while I climb the ladder
Too much garbage in your gallbladder, fall flatter
On your face, now you carry by the pall-bearer
Or wear the black suit, eyes all teared up
Oh no, when your ho make a boss lit up
We in the rib with a smirk nigga, all geared up
Childish Gambino or Bobby Digi'lino on the tracks
We breaking more backs that Sammartino, Bruno
We saw more baselines than Juno
Change more law in New York than Mr. Cuomo
Godfather novels I write like Mario Puzo
Master time fix the clocks like I'm Hugo
Hold the weight like nine sumos
Bust shots like John Lugo
You know how the Wu go

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Look sharp, homie give yourself a facelift
High brow, eyebrows on a spaceship
Take sips of that Ace of Spades-es
Saving all my money just to waste on a bracelet
Can't see them haters, we don't give a fuck though
Charge it to the game, keep a lame so cutthroat
Never slip a fast one, the game is so in front of me
Travel 'round the globe, spend and make 'bout a 100 G's
Pack them crowds up, boss like Bowser
Deep pocket poetry, my custom trousers
Thank God they found us, the game was starvin'
I'm clean and concrete, you ass and Charmin
Bobby Digital, do you really think these niggas know shit?
Shopping in Manhattan and I ran into my old chick
Pride is a bitch, I am not a grown up
Tweetin' when I'm 70, these half-dead followers
She look like she Spelman, secretly she Hofstra
Put her in the club, all she wanna hear is Waka
Put her in the crib, all she wanna hear is Waka
She jerk when I move like her old boy popped her
Home is that Outkast, soul like I'm Phonte
Old-school J's like Beyoncé's fiancé
Back on my dumb shit, nigga we the stupidest
Gave them niggas real shit, don't know what to do with it
I did what I did man, did you really see it though?
'Bino hard and fast, niggas Sweet'N Low
American Royalty, family loyalty
We cream of the crop why the fuck would we stop?
She had two sons: both of 'em good grades
Both of 'em rap songs
Where did she go wrong?
Nowhere mama, we just go where the money at
Black Kennedy, where the fuck you niggas at?

[Produced by Myke Murda]

[Intro]
It's royalty
It's royalty

[Verse: Ghostface Killah]
Hey world, this is lollipop, raps for the sweet tooth
The real fiends who want that GhostFace and Sheek Louch
Big chain changlin' charms, they be danglin'
Eighty thou worth of the ice, I'll strangle 'em
My raw fish scale, paid the jeweler named Ishmael
Had to eagle fly back to my wrist
Bigger chips, bigger wings, bigger rings
I'm with the Childish Gambino
On that Eastwood shit, pushin' a Gran Torino
Tarantino don't got reservoir dogs like mine
Thirty six different niggas with the same state of mind
Dirty Ghetto Kids lovin' them haters
We got skaters that'll ox your whole face off
Rob you like Madoff
Drug kingpins on the diet, we get that weight off
Real hood niggas snatch a bitch and clean your plate off
Gambino rap, cash money crack, table casino
Precision cut emeralds, sapphire visuals

[Chorus: Danielle Haim]
We are so far away from here

[Verse: Childish Gambino]
Tell 'em run it back, this song is my shit
Told that DJ "Turn it up!", all we did was Bowflex (Woo)
It’s that Stone Mountain, DeKalb county
Fuck boys know shit 'bout me
Still real, no shit, cash gun, money clip
285 to 400 then I made a left (Yeah)
Man, we spend it up in Lenox, boy, we fresh to death
They be sleepin' when I left, now they heard of me
We get paid to get y’all hyped, that’s that turnip green
New kicks, street ball (Ayy)
Black top, asphalt
Tight dress, her ass fault, get face like bath salts
Airport atheist, only pray when there's turbulence
So why the fuck am I stressin’ over this nervous shit?

[Chorus: Danielle Haim]
We are so far away from here
We are so far away from here

[Bridge: Childish Gambino]
Burn, burn, burn
My new car (Yeah), my new clothes (Hoo)
Now that I’m on top, are you proud of me?
Burn, burn, burn (Yeah)
My new car (Yeah), my new clothes (Hoo)
Now that I won't stop, are you proud of me?

[Outro: Childish Gambino]
All I really wanted was a left turn
Never thought it'd go and leave a nigga burned
Now that I’m on top, are ya proud of me, proud of me?
All I really wanted was a left turn
Never thought it'd go and leave a nigga burned
Now that I’m on top, are ya proud of me, proud of me?
Are you proud of me?
Are you proud of me?
Na-na-na-no-no-no
Na-na-na-no-no-oh
I shoulda known
Na-na-no, shoulda known
Shoulda known

[Chorus: Josh Osho]
We finally made it
And now we sailin’
I never dreamed we’d get this far
My heart keeps askin'
How'd it get so wonderful? So wonderful
How'd it get so wonderful? (Like we know)
So wonderful (Like we know)

[Verse: Childish Gambino]
You can call the shots, I’m going to my aunt’s house
What’s it all about? Lookin’ like I’m Millhouse
What’s it all about? I ain’t get my bike back
I ain’t get my bike back, I know where he live at
I know what he look like, I know what I live like
Five to a bed, head to toe, that’s a good night
Five to a bed, head to toe, with the fan on
I don’t think these other niggas know what ya man on
I used to have to sneak just to get my food
Free lunch made it feel like they don’t approve
Sell a card for a dollar used to be the move
I wanna be Jabari man, that nigga cool
I wanna lash out, nigga keep your cool
All my friend did was draw something, now he outta school
‘Cause everything was always “Show me what you made of”
And everybody knew somebody who was laid up
I didn’t need it, mama said it’s a lesson
Some people will never like you
Don’t let ’em catch you stressin’
You know a code’s a code, the world can’t stop ’em
Eating out rat holes and Cheerios boxes
This nigga think he hot shit, he think he good at everything
I just didn’t wanna get left out more
My little sis’ mom got shot, she in the newspaper
Prayers couldn’t save her, she died a day later
Like my cousin got that HIV
When she bust the leg open playing jump rope
Should I tell them kids what the fuck’s up?
They gon' judge her and me
Man fuck them, we livin’, all is forgiven
I fucked up royally
But now that’s who we are man, you gotta use the royal "we"
This is royalty, and this is all I ever wanted ‘cause

[Chorus: Josh Osho]
We finally made it
And now we're sailin’
I never dreamed we’d get this far
My heart keeps askin'
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful
We finally made it
And now we're sailin’
I never dreamed we’d get this far
My heart keeps askin'
How did it get so wonderful? (Know) So wonderful (Ohh)
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
I got a PJ for the whole crew
Passport looking old news
Champagne in a glasshouse
Old money know what I’m about
Put your money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
Nigga, I’m from Georgia, that’s the realest state

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
I’m feeling like New Zealand, charge it to the Am-Ex
Gotta use that latex or she living like a princess
They don’t wake you up in private, let a nigga sleep
I got houses in the mountains, man Will Smith live down the street
Got that generation money, my grandkids are assholes
Stacking something dummy, every verse I got got cash flow
Monaco they loved me, I’m wearing something ugly
But they still know I’m rich though so my doo-rag lookin’ stuffy
Rollin’ with the royalty, Kauai is just my Camelot
Glasshouse, champagne, white shirt, no socks, no top Saint Bart's
Pushin’ 997’s like I’m making fuckin’ phone calls
Half a mill' is low ball
Lot of diamonds light bright, whiskey older than Betty White
Spot me on Dalmatian Croatian girls salvation us
Make something of myself man
Somebody let ’em know, ‘cause it’s that Eastside nigga (A-T-L!)

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
I got a PJ for the whole crew
Passport looking old news
Champagne in a glasshouse
Old money know what I’m about
Put your money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
Nigga, I’m from Georgia, that’s the realest state

[Verse 2: Alley Boy]
Ridin’ around with a whole meal, real estate, can a nigga live?
Gold slug, no ice grill, deal with Molly, no x pill
Georgia nigga I’m A-town, Eastside nationwide
Rep nigga like Tim Briggs, killed them, homicide
Real estate that’s my estate Georgia peach like Big Meech
Mason Ave, that’s my street, we sellin’ crack on Front Street
Old money got dust on it, old chopper got rust on it
New crib got a ticket on it, just cashed out seven figures on it
Baby mama, stank bitch fought child support, I’m too rich
Pussy ho got lucky, you can pay your bills on my dick
My driver license’s suspended, but I’m still ridin’ in a Bentley
I’m still strapped with that semi, real estate we winnin’
Me and Childish Gambino plenty chips, no casino
Poppin’ bottles with models, they gon' suck on some pronto
Put my grill in your real estate, know I come from that realest state
Niggas eatin' off our paper plate, we just copped them new Audi 8's

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
I got a PJ for the whole crew
Passport looking old news
Champagne in a glasshouse
Old money know what I’m about
Put your money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
Nigga, I’m from Georgia, that’s the realest state
I got a PJ for the whole crew
Passport looking old news
Champagne in a glasshouse
Old money know what I’m about
Put your money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
Nigga, I’m from Georgia, that’s the realest state

[Interlude: Swank]
Man, Atlanta showing love too, man
Shout out to Eastside, shout out to Southside, Westside
And fuck the Northside, man them niggas up there be testin’
Ain’t nothing changed man, we still get money out here
Royalty forever in this bitch
Gambino nigga, you know what I’m saying?
That new shit man
One time for the one time man, real nigga stand up
Two times for the bad bitches, three for the rich
You know what I’m talking about?
You know what it is man, yeah man
Money talk, bullshit walkin’ marathon
Real niggas know what I’m talking about
Royalty forever motherfucker
Gambino forever motherfucker
Get used to it, Royalty nigga, Royalty motherfucker
Motherfucking Eastside stand up, Stone Mountain, L-town
We in this bitch like we fuckin' a dog or some shit, my nigga
Man y’all motherfuckers already know what it is
Royalty forever in this bitch, bitch niggas fall back
Real recognize real and y’all sucka niggas ain’t it
You feel me? Man don’t watch me, watch TV
Wait, ‘Bino on that shit too, God damn!
Man, we gettin' that white people money, you heard that?
Matter of fact Tina, tell these niggas what I’m talking about one time

[Outro: Tina Fey]
Yeah, we in here, we in this thing
Gambino is forever, Royalty is forever
We ballin’ ‘till we fuckin’ up the hardwood homey
This is the life we live, son
My president is black and my Prius is blue, motherfucker
Royalty all day, we droppin’ racks in Nordstroms, son
That’s racks on racks, damn it
You feel me? You feel me?
This is the part where most people would say something crazy and drop the n-word after it
Not going to, not gonna do that
I don’t feel comfortable
I’m out!

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I was 16 when we first laid eyes
Scrawny little fucker, yeah, I was that guy
And you was down for the weekend, I was down for the greetings
And you eyes the same color shit that Jasper be chiefing
Couple freckles on ya noses, roses made you blush
Gentleman I was like I wasn't tryna fuck
But it was my first official date so I was stuck, like
It was past curfew, and we was at the Grove
And it was raining, and I had to be home
And then you grab my hand, talking about tryna get home safe or something
All I remember was your motherfucking face

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
I play in your hair as you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked
Feels like I’m floating in air
Can't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Man, this feels like a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a Ziploc bag

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
You gotta a nigga sprung, whenever I’m holding your hand and
Making eye contact, I feel like the damn man
Cause even though I am and get round of applauses
I'm insecure and start to think that I do not stand chance
But, moments, wish that I can own it or lease it or clone it
'Cause holding your fingertips is golden
I fucking love you, now treat my palms like a bowling ball and
Grip and keep holding on girl

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
As you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked
Feels like I'm floating in air
'Can't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Man, this feels like a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a Ziploc bag
You got a nigga-

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Wait
Don't think this is going to work
Things got complicated and a couple feelings got hurt
I haven't talked to you in a couple of days
I got too comfortable
And started to think that we was really a couple
But hey, (Fuck you) at least there was time spent
But by the time you hear this you won't know what these rhymes meant
But when you realize, it's awkward, your name still my password
So I'm always fucking reminded
You got a nigga sprung

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Frank Ocean]
You're my girlfriend... You're my girl (Whether you like it or not!)
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girl, girlfriend (You know I like you a lot!)
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girl (Shit, I know that you not)
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girlfriend
You're my girl.. oooo
You're my, you're my Girl
Ooooo girlfriend... girlfriend..
You're my girlfriend you're my girl girlfriend
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend

[Chorus]
Love is nice when it's understood
Even nicer when it makes you feel good
You got me trippin' why our love is old
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll

[Verse 1]
It's like Woodstock city, brand new villain
And bark to the music, sucker than a psychic
My heart beat acoustic, moves like Hendrix
Walk to a fire, then I flame and kiss it
Go hard in my lambo, strikes and a visit
To meeting in the rain, gotta roll with the vision
Vision of a good time, all I wanna know
When the party gonna stop, let the good times roll
Come on let's go, you got another minute
Get the party on the roll, ain't nothing like the feeling
When you're winning in your soul
The wheel keep spinning, only got one love
Stop, stop the show, and stop, stop the flow
The world ain't ready 'cause I rock the globe
So act like you know, act like you know
Act like you know, just what to do
When the good times roll

[Chorus]
Love is nice when it's understood
Even nicer when it makes you feel good
You got me trippin' why our love is old
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll

[Verse 2]
Roll is on, everybody come to get the taste of the bomb
Feeling wild shopper when you're bad to the bone
Gotta be the hottest when you shine like chrome
Gotta find that tone, has a mind of it's own
Love while I'm supposed to look around and it's gone
Love while I'm supposed to up hold it down for this crown
Just like her, I'm already gone
Let the good times go
All I wanna lock, lock, up in this drop top
Pull up in the Chevy so classy and hot, hot
Pockets full and heavy got you screaming what you got got
What you tryna say, I know I already rock, rock
Gotta let go, pedal to the floor
So incredible, so much better with the flow
Ready for the show, like I'm singing hey yo
Do it like a pro, let the good times roll, roll, roll, roll...

[Bridge]
And let's go all night, all night
Wake up the club and let's go all out, all out
More drinks for us, toast for the good times
Where they last forever, we're young's, yeah, the good times
Raise your glass, let's all have some fun

[Chorus]
Love is nice when it's understood
Even nicer when it makes you feel good
You got me trippin' why our love is old
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let the good times roll

[Verse 1]
Who knew we would be where we are, here today?
Yeah, who knew that your heart had a cost, I would pay, girl
Ain't gon' be all peaches I thought all through the pain you would stay
I guess, life is no fair no

[Pre-Chorus]
Just listen to me, we can't go on
Pretending to be, like we're so strong
Love, gone, gone with the wind
I've got something to give to you

[Chorus]
Black roses for this dying love
Now we're breaking up, since we giving up
Black roses, an early valentine
Special delivery, just for you and I

[Verse 2]
Who knew our love would ever be called a memory?
Who knew my home for happiness would soon be misery?
Hate that we're so distant, girl, do you even miss me at all?
I guess, life is no fair, no no

[Pre-Chorus]
Just listen to me, we can't go on
Pretending to be, like we're so strong
Love, gone, gone with the wind
I've got something to give to you

[Chorus]
Black roses for this dying love
Now we're breaking up, since we giving up
Black roses, an early valentine
Special delivery, just for you and I

[Bridge]
Can't sleep, can't eat, I can't erase the pain
'Cause I still feel your heart beat, a million miles away
I can't think, can't sleep, I can't erase the pain
'Cause I still feel your heart beat , a million miles away
I can't think, can't sleep, can't eat, I can't erase the pain
'Cause I still feel your heart beat, a million miles away

[Chorus]
Black roses for this dying love
Now we're breaking up, since we giving up
Black roses, an early valentine
Special delivery, just for you and I

[Outro]
Black roses, black roses

I love to see you walk into the room
Body shining, lightin' up the place
And when you talk, everybody stop
'Cause they know you know just what to say, and
The way that you protect your friends
Baby, I respect you for that
And when you grow, you take everyone you love along
I love that shit

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't fly me away
Don't need to buy a diamond key
To unlock my heart

'Cause you know there's more to life
And if I need you, you will be here
You will make the sacrifice

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't fly me away
Don't need to buy a diamond key
To unlock my heart

Gotta hold you

Boy, without you my life just ain't the same
You don't have to try so hard for me to love you

Let's hit the sweet spot, oh, I, I, I, I
I'm ready to go, I want candy tonight

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Yeah, I wanna take you back to my spot
You can be the candy girl in my shop
We both know what we cravin', why not?
Make tonight first class with no stops
Girl, you know I run a love game, never play Uno
You wanna leave, follow me to the two-door
Rock your culo, love it when you call me your papi chulo
I got a thing for you, you got a thing for me
Heard she kiss the Milky Way and bring to life your fantasies
You're sweeter than Mama's homemade Kool-Aid
Touch it, then make the seas split two ways
You love it, I do too, girl, don't play
I'm just waitin' to hear you say

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Let's hit the sweet spot, oh, I, I, I, I
I'm ready to go, I want candy toni-i-i-ight
I got a taste and I'm hooked on you for life
My, oh my, hit the sweet spot tonight

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Yeah, I wanna hit the spot that gets you hot
And makes you feel like everybody need to have it this sweet
Baby, just a hit, just speak, I got your candy, shawty
Come around, give it to you that deep
Ooh, don't you get me started, hit the afterparty all night
You done ran into a freak that'll take you home
Make you moan, watch the throne
Yeah, lil mama, I'm the king of these sheets, gotta love it
Girl, you want it, you can have it, no question
Been a whole lot of rubbin' and touchin'
What you know about the candy I'm hustlin', musclin'?
Talkin' that Russian
Bring it back like, baby, who you rushin'?
I been ready, never talkin' sweet nothings
I'll be the first to give your body sweet justice
So pack a luggage and let's, let's

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Let's hit the sweet spot, oh, I, I, I, I

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]

[Intro]
Should have brought that wasabi
That horseradish
Cubed up
Fuckin' sniffin' that horseradish

[Verse 1]
Yo I'm the young Laird Hamilton
Hoppin' out the chopper
Scorin' like I'm Messi but this game is far from soccer
Giambi on the lenses and the juice is from the doctor
Jar still full of drugs
An 80s Caddy painted aqua
Take these and freeze they nose
Dick sucked by a seasoned pro
Info on the need to know
Motherfucker you don't need to know
Gimme trees to blow
I keep the caesar low
I want the head, the shoulders, and the knees and toes
From the hottest summer to the freezing snow
Mind higher then a bleeding nose
I'm Bobby Fischer
Check mate
You're like a Spanish Roasted Chicken
Break your chest plate
And yes I just ate
I keep that napkin near me
My favorite uncle went to summer camp for racketeering

[Hook]
Tossin' money like a Muslim Wedding
Sleep on satin bed sheets with the custom threading
Tossin' money like a Muslim Wedding
Sleep on satin bed sheets with the custom threading

[Verse 2]
This be that whore house visitor
Watch em' while they scissor
103 your Roosevelt
Fancy on the shoes and belt
Nasty pussy tuna melt
Stinky like a China street
You're bound to find me where the corporate and the grimy meet
Lay flat on designer sheet
She kept asking me to grind her grease
So I pound a freak like a pound of meat
Top dog cause I hound the street
I'm makin' poopy on your head cause this is easy
Old Italian men inside the kitchen making cheeses

[Hook]
Tossin' money like a Muslim Wedding
Sleep on satin bed sheets with the custom threading
Tossin' money like a Muslim Wedding
Sleep on satin bed sheets with the custom threading

[Verse 1]
We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise
I spoke into his eyes, "I thought you died alone
A long long time ago"

[Chorus]
Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Verse 2]
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years, I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare
At all the millions here
We must have died alone
A long long time ago

[Chorus]
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]

How you gone do a freaky girl song and not include Nicki Minaj?
I mean come on now, you know my fuckin' name, let's get it

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
She's a very freaky girl, don't bring her to mama

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Uhnn you want a freaky girl? Welcome to Nicki World

Um, let me think, what could I do to kick it off?
How bout I cum all on your dick and then I lick it off?
I mean it's something so funny when it get soft
I like to play with it, squeeze it like a stress ball
He say he like to hear the sound of me slurpin' it
Turn off his phone cause them hoes keep churpin' it
Tell me that I get the fattest pussy in the whole world
And if I let him eat it, I can be his ol' girl
Fuck I look like turning down some head?
I mean that's sorta like a bird turning down some bread?
You can eat it like a treat, you can squirt it, you can skeet, I'm a freak, I love to beat, just don't get none in my sheets
Every time I pop the coochie, Gucci start chokin' me
Now I'm kinda scared I got a feelin' Gucci stalkin' me
Sex game kinky, niggas call me Pinky
Fuck with presidents, I am Nicki Lewinsky

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
She's a very freaky girl, don't bring her to mama
First you get her name, then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer

[Verse 2: Lil Kim]
I'm a very freaky gurl, very freaky gurl, gurl
Very freaky gurl, very freaky gurl, gurl
Very freaky gurl, very freaky gurl, gurl
Ohhh, you want a freaky girl? Welcome to Kimmy's world
You ain't gon' wanna leave, it's like a kid at Disney World
My deep throat have you squirtin' like a water gun
Coochie overflowin' like somebody let the faucet run
Bust one nut, I ain't done, I got more to come
Friends tell 'em more to come, we gon have some orgy fun, Yeaaaah
Chew on me like some bubble gum
Might lick you like a lollipop once you taste my honey bun
It's our lil' secret, just like my underwear
You know pain is pleasure, can you make me shed a tear? Smack my ass, grab my neck, got em cummin' everywhere
I'm a freak so I don't care, just don't get none in my hair
Now he callin' me wifey and he wanna introduce me
Takin' me on shopping sprees he wanna buy me Gucci (Gucci)
Zoom like Boosie on the back of his Suzuki and I ain't even sex em'
All I did was let him eat my... coochie!

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
She's a very freaky girl, don't bring her to mama
First you get her name, then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Very freaky girl, don't bring her to mama
First you get her name, then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer

[Interlude: Wiz Khalifa, Snoop Dogg, Student]
I've been trying to develop an alternative fuel from a mix of all natural substances
But the mix was highly volatile until we found a catalyst
To help stabilize the compound and supercharge the fuel
I'm sorry, what was this magical catalyst?
Marijuana, motherfucker!
Uh, ladies and gentlemen, players and playettes, teachers, staff, and students
I am very honored to welcome you to the high school annual talent show
Brought to you by the makers of Wiz Khalifa premium rolling papers
And the qualified growers of Snoop Dogg master Kush
So without further a due let's get this show on the road
First contestant bring your talent to the foreground and let your smoke be the background

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Everytime I go out, I'm blowing that smoke out
I buy it, don't even know the price
I talk cause I live it, come pay me a visit
And I'll be somewhere up in the sky
My nigga it's about to go down
We fly, it's no lie, that we high, 'til we die
All we need up in heres hoes now
Roll one up, clean the ride (Uh), case them hoes wanna jump inside

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Got a joint filled with quality shit
My bottom bitch smoking with me, niggas talk shit
All of 'em shrimp (Haha), I'm a big fish
Roll a joint, lick it once, tell you hit this
Groupies on my dick, several kushes on my hit-list
In and out these niggas bitches
Smoking tree and not to mention hustling, trying to mind my business
You probably went to class while I was in the hallway skipping
Yeah I hear what they saying, just be to high to listen
'Bout my money, tripping if I even fold it wrong
You ain't smoking this good, if it's fire, tell you I sold it all
Or wait 'til one of my hoes come 'round to roll it all
Or say fuck it and cuff it 'til I go smoke with Dogg
I show off, I show out, I show off
Car push to start, hit the button once it go off
Keep the money coming in and the papers rolled up
And ain't worried about a hating nigga, they get no love

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Everytime I go out (Out, out, out), I'm blowing that smoke out
I buy it, don't even know the price
I talk cause I live it, come pay me a visit
And I'll be somewhere up in the sky
My nigga it's about to go down
We fly, it's no lie, that we high, 'til we die
All we need up in heres hoes now
Roll one up, clean the ride, case them hoes wanna jump inside

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I go green like I was Arch Bishop Don Juan
And blow circles around you suckas like a marathon
My gym teacher told me but I didn't listen
My bitch did my homework and now I'm in detention
It should be suspension, this is my audition
So play your position, get the picture I envision
Did she mention; Snoop Dogg was made for kissing
A barracuda fishing, she on a mission for me
Pleasure, pain, and glory in my inventory
My SATs my little bitch she did 'em for me
And now we prancing on stage at the talent show
We flossing, my clothes, my chain, and my knapsack
Full of that, hand me that, can you see my telescope
Principal say she want to see me cause she smell my smoke
'Bout my money, tripping even if I fold it wrong
Blowing zones with Wiz because this is the protocol

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Everytime I go out, I'm blowing that smoke out
I buy it, don't even know the price
I talk cause I live it, come pay me a visit
And I'll be somewhere up in the sky
My nigga it's about to go down
We fly, it's no lie, that we high, 'til we die
All we need up in heres hoes now
Roll one up, clean the ride, case them hoes wanna jump inside

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I'm hotter than a Kawasaki in the projects
Burning more than rubber, money ain't a object
I'm number 1, and hurt they feelings in the process
Cop a bird, then your really seein progress
I'm buying cars like I'm in a contest
Say my name, rappers lookin like a bomb threat
I'm the winner, these beginners talking nonsense
Brain from your ? till she render me unconscious
I'm so conscious of DNA in my closet
My show account can't take another deposit
Ladies heartthrob labelled me the odd ball
3.5 cause I'm known to start small

[Hook: Schife]
If you from the streets like me, put your hands up!
D Boys on my tease, put your hands up!
Independent bad bitches, put your hands up!

Somebody pass my ?
That's the new thug passion
This we the best music
Put your hands up!

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I need your touch, but your hands are locked away
I hear your voice, you've got nothing left to say
I'll take this scar off my heart
I'll take this bullet, I'll take it for love

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
So if the lights in the sky come crashing down
I still can find your love even in the crowd
But will you remember me?

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
Will you remember my name? (Ooh-ooh)
Remember my name (Ooh-ooh)
Will you remember my name? (Oh-oh)
Remember my name

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I love you, I love you, I love you
Remember my—
I love you, I love you, love you
Remember my name
I love you, I love you, love you
Remember my—
I love you, I love you, I love you
Remember my name

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I need your kiss, but your lips are far away
So I have no choice, so I guess I'll have to steal your love away
And I'll take this scar from my heart, bang-bang
I take this bullet (Bang-bang), I take it for love (Bang-bang)
I take it for love (Bang-bang), I’ll take it for us

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
Will you remember my name? (My name, my name, my name)
Remember my name (My name, my name)
Will you remember my name? (My name, my name, my name)
Oh, remember my name (My name)

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I love you, I love you, I love you

I love you, I love you, love you
Remember my—
I love you, I love you, I love you
Remember my name

[Verse 3: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter & Both]
Floating above the clouds and sky, wishing upon a falling star
Hoping my love hasn't forgotten my name
It's automatic this attraction, this love is so strong
Two birds up above, baby, wishing we could float off
And we can fly higher, babe, higher babe
Higher babe, higher babe, higher babe
Just fly higher, babe, higher babe
Higher babe, higher babe
All gas, no breaks, I just wanna levitate
All gas, no breaks, I just wanna levitate
All gas, no breaks, I just wanna levitate
Just wanna levitate, I just wanna levitate

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
Will you remember my name? (My name, my name, my name, remember my name)
Remember my name (My name, my name, remember my name)
Will you remember my name? (Oh-oh, my name, my name)
Remember my name (My name)

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Remember my—
Remember my name
Remember my—
Remember my name

[Verse 1]
When I was a young boy I tried to listen
And I wanna feel like that
Little white shadows
Blink and miss them
Part of a system, I am

[Verse 2]
If you ever feel like something's missing
Things you'll never understand
Little white shadows
Sparkle and glisten
Part of a system, a plan

[Bridge]
All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space, I'm taking up
All this sound is breaking up
Ohhhhhhhh

[Chorus]
Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state
Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it, you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state, a permanent state

[Verse 3]
When I was a young boy I tried to listen
Don't you wanna feel like that?
You're part of the human race
All of the stars and the outer space
Part of the system, a plan

[Bridge]
All this noise, I'm waking up
All this space I'm taking up
I cannot hear, you're breaking up
Whooaaaaaaa

[Chorus]
Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll stumble upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state
Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it, you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a permanent state, a permanent state

[Outro]
Swim out on a sea of faces
Tide of the human races
Oh, an answer now is what I need...
See it in a new sun rising
See it break on your horizon
Oh, come on love, stay with me...

[Verse 1]
Christmas night, another fight
Tears, we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet, to Oxford Street
Tryna right a wrong
Just walk away, those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

[Refrain]
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

[Verse 2]
Up above candles on air flicker
Oh, they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

[Refrain]
Oh, when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

[Chorus 1]
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on

[Chorus 2]
Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus 1]
Oh, Christmas lights
Light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas lights, keep shining on
Die Bitches, Check it out bitches
All you bitch ass rappers
Need to get your clit repierced, Look at me, hip, I'm Britney Spears
Look at the way I wear my mascara
How you doing
I'm Pristina Gaguilera, And I sing songs about a genie in a bottle
And I'm Britney Spears
I got big tits, I'm a role model
To all little kids
But I got breast implants
That was the only way to get my chest enhanced
And here I go with the lyrical, miracle, spiritual everytime im incredible
With freestyles from the top that I drop
And my instinct
Is to kill N'Sync
And the Backstreet Boys
It really doesn't matter coz' I got a scratchy voice
Yo, check it out
But you ask me I ain't gonna be happy til' I see every member of the Backstreet Boys
Getting their ass beat
In the back seat of a taxi, And dropped of on the real backstreet
And somebody black sees five little rich white boys
Looking like faggots
With the N-word painted on the back of their jackets

[Proof]

Ohhhhh
And god damn it
Can't stop there
What's up?
It's over
And this just Some Bacardi and Mountain Dew

[Eminem]

And wonder how we tune is
Ten million

[Verse 1]
Fiasco thats my name don't wear it out
Especially in front of feds who want to know my where-abouts
Where the house and his stash-box at
How he live where he is who he flash Glocks at
And them hurt play boys drop all types of change so we gotta dog-fight all night with the range its all right
You know I be the all time small nine carrier all across America, quick to bury ya
Who done pulled out more babies than Heathcliff Huxtable
He is W, A-S with the A-R and the L-S with the V-S and his ch-arm kids jealous they get pellets
Buck shots and what not
Who tough top get stuck in they mouth like gum-drops
These niggas think they're immune but I got chick-booms that will put them in tribunes, resume

[Verse 2]
Niggas taking mine not permissible. On visual gon' be physical. Niggas don't believe in God make them spiritual
He make it out that whip it's a miracle
No salad dressing just dress him in his best and bless him I said it so I meant it
I take it if its local Fed-Ex or if it's distant
The business
Mostly sold to the block
Only told to my pops
Only for if its a lot the Glocks And the watch I dropped
Sealing when I'm peeling
Shop Neimans by the season for the freaks them
Two pair of jeans and decent
Niggas praying I don't see em
MC's is praying I don't see em
I'm franchise now
They just playing for the season
I'mma have shoes next year the way I do this here
I dominate they domino
It's common though typically, lyrically catch yourself slipping with me

[Verse 3]
I'm quite sinister facing two murders one verbal one vehicular
Whipping ah
Pearl white tight with the cinema
Two tears black killing ya
A few years back was the red room distributor
Looking ill'er I-L's with the temperature
Skytell on vibrate hide mail from pirates
Emperor
Niggas is pussy and bleed vinegar
Chill-Illy on the index, Jerome on the MX, mack millies
And for-really all you insects one hit wonders don't streak like Windex
Hit Michigan for the caper
Mr. Chen get the paper
Laundromats in Hong Kong with the accent saying cat trying to wack my smack connect
Before he get clipped make sure my stacks correct
Hoes get invaded Cadillacs get wrecked
No Problemo long as my habitat's in check

[Verse 1]
It's too much a mess and a stress to figure out
And too much pressure on us, babe
Last night you took me to the mall
And then it started to get physical

[Pre-Chorus]
But we've only been on one date, baby
Yeah, and it was fun 'til you start acting crazy
I don't really find it very cute or sexy
When you call or incessantly t-t-text me

[Chorus]
Don't be dirty ice cream, baby
We could fall in love
But it's too early to be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'
It's not indecision, just my female intuition
Telling me you can't be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'

[Verse 2]
I can't live with you, yes it's true
Or live without the kind of guy that I'm about
You kiss me like a rockstar
And you always wanna hold my hand

[Pre-Chorus]
But we've only been on one date, baby
Yeah, and it was fun 'til you start acting crazy
I don't really find it very cute or sexy
When you call or incessantly t-t-text me

[Chorus]
Don't be dirty ice cream, baby
We could fall in love
But it's too early to be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'
It's not indecision, just my female intuition
Telling me you can't be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'

[Breakdown]
Don't be, don't be (dirty ice cream)
Don't be, don't be (dirty ice cream)
Don't be, don't be (dirty ice cream)
Don't be, don't be
Oh no, don't be, don't be
Oh no, don't be, don't be
Oh no, don't be, don't be
Don't be, don't be

[Chorus]
Don't be dirty ice cream, baby
We could fall in love
But it's too early to be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'
It's not indecision, just my female intuition
Telling me you can't be calling me like that
Stop callin' us, stop callin'

[Verse 1]
Vision lies the 3rd dimension
Now pay close attention
Keep you fist clenchin
As I begin my assention
Feel the tension
Of this name you never mention
If you do I'll have they're ass sitting in detention
In the school of hard knocks
I block shots and take props
I'm like new york city at 12 o'clock when the apple drop
At 12 o'clock when the apple drop

[Hook]
Oh My God (5x)

[Verse 2]
Check the illmatic
Evil flows kinder a static
Crazy ill fanatic, sick physco simatic
Like an addict
Only addicted to them fat beats
You better take a seat
Before the lyrics and the music be too late
You better coordinate you feet
Before I blast that ass
You'll be outcastin like a black sheep
Don't believe me, what will it take for you to see me
Or get this shit straight 'til we be busting out your
TV
Like VR bout to smoke you, like a cigar
Won't be satisfied until you recognize who we are
I'm so crazy like martin, farting fire like Cartman
Be witness to these lyrical riots that I be startin
If you're real, we friends to the end like Chuckie
And if not, you'll live if you're lucky
And if not, you'll live if you're lucky

[Hook]
Oh My God (4x)

[Verse 3]
Yo yo
That red means stop (stop)
But that green means go (go)
Stretch my mind catch a rhyme like Steve Percipio
But I don't skate I just been known to rip a mic
Until I get pissed off
And just might throw this mic at you
You can't escape it just like death when it comes
I can see it, you catch a kick like them Yamaha drums
And that's the bricks, as I lounge like a fat rat
You bust back and might catch a cat, rat-a-tat-tat
The one and only always real, never phoney
Look to the sky, the world is mine like Tony
Ain't no scars on my face, and I don't sniff coke
I ain't got my own place, and my pockets is broke

[Hook]
I'm reppin self, to hell wit anyone else (3x)
I'm reppin self

[Outro]
So just hold ya head, and say Oh My
God
Hold ya head, and say Oh My God
Grab a hold of your dread and say Oh My God
Oh My God, Oh My God
Is this real?

You gotta a lot, a lot of nerve
Comin' here when I'm still with him
And I can't have you
It isn't fair
Born March of '86
My birthday's comin', and if I had one wish
Yeah, you'd be it

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're 'round, I lose myself inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes like no one else

Again, again, a-a-again, again
Never stop, oh

When you're 'round, I lose myself inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes like no one else
Baby, make it to me...

[Chorus]

Again, again, again, again
Never stop
Again and again
Again, again, a-a-again, again
Never stop, oh

[Outro]
They tell me
If I leave him, baby, would you be there?
'Cause maybe, you could be m-m-mine all the t-t-time

[Verse 1]
It seems like lately time be beatin’ my ass
Every step is like a right hook
From Iron Mike Tyson in his prime
It’s like my mind is on a treadmill
I’m sweatin’ bullets, I see the plug but I can’t pull it
This belt just keeps bringin’ me back
And every minute is like a tiger uppercut from Sagat
I’m up against these ropes, and ain’t no tellin’ if I win or not
These gloves are getting heavy
It’s fight or flight you know how that goes
Facin’ clocks is chasin’ got me dodgin’ obstacles
And every hour is like a tightrope, I walk with greasy shoes
Still yet I got my conscience tellin’ me that I can’t lose
So every time I start slippin’ and ego’s start trippin
I focus real hard and levitate just like I’m God
And everything is lovely, I’m in the clouds no one above me
With the gift to differentiate snakes from those that love me
There’s a thin line between happiness and hopeless
An even thinner line between on point and out of focus
But Back to my story, about my fall from glory
And how I levitate from the fate time put before me
They say ‘Be patient’
But what the fuck is patience when my heart is racin’?
Put yourself in my situation
Try to be humble, you won’t refrain from getting pissed
When you look down to see you’re fallin’ right through time’s abyss
And start to see visions
Memories you really miss, simple things, like;
Your first birthday wish
Your first girlfriend
Your first love
Your first French kiss
Your first time feeling hate
The first time you got dissed
Your first day of school
Your very first college class
Your first time touchin’ titties
First time you got ass
Your first time learnin’ wrong from right
First lonely night
The first time you got your ass whooped in
Your first real fight
Your first triple-double dare
Your first pubic hair
Your first time watchin’ Jason
Your first nightmare

That’s when you realize that time was your worst nightmare
And now you’re stuck asking yourself ‘Why ain’t life fair?'
You get closer to the bottom, see the end of your line
Your first time ever losin’ this battle with time
But right before you meet your death, one more memory left
The only one that’s obsolete was your first breath (3x)

[Hook]
One moon to the next
Clocks switch when you least expect it and make the simplest shit complex
The baby face got the planet fooled
Books get judged by the covers worldwide, coincide with the illest
The real is just fictional dreams
No time to deal with two dimensional fiends, shit hit’s the fan with every click of a hand
I’ll be a man eventually
When the kid in me is satisfied
But ‘til the day arrives all I got is eighty-five

[Verse 2]
A clock can kill motivation
That’s why I’m never rockin’ a watch
What’s a deadline when you’re living on your own time?
I’m livin’ slow, Peter Pan style son
You didn’t know I never grow up, my mind is set at six years old
As far as I’m concerned this grown-up shit is for the birds
So pass the skittles, JuJu Fruits, the Now N Laters, and Nerds
I’m eatin’ sweets until my teeth fall out and I can’t see
And I’m deaf in my left ear but my right can hear cause I’m livin’ happily
So why you mad at me? Cause your frustrations gave you grey hairs
99% of your life’s spent chasin’ American nightmares
I’m crazy childish, just check the habits
I play with my food, pick my nose, and eat it damn it
Plus I pick my scabs, I be the first to pop a blister
Cause I’m more immature than that cat from Sister-Sister
If my parents tell me no I’m gonna do it anyway
Experience will make more sense than anything that they could ever say

[Verse 3]
Forever playin’ video games until I’m sleepy
Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, please, you’ll never beat me
So basically you’re better off paying a bill or somethin’
Your mind is elderly, forty over the hill or somethin’
I’m young at heart, I’mma forever be a kid
I’m on some Tom Hanks shit, you ever seen the movie Big?
My heart is trapped in ’85 the coolest place I’ve ever been in my life
We watchin’ Smurfs, eatin’ cinnamon LIFE
Never knew a crack rock, cause it was Fraggle
The only pink pussy we knew was Snaggle, Your mind’s in the dirt
We playin’ Hungry-Hippo’s ‘til our hands hurt
What do you know about pourin’ out a whole box of Trix to get the toy out
(Scared to) go to sleep cause somethin’s under your bed
(And all it) took was one look to get them thoughts out your head
(And then ya’) fall right to sleep without a worry in mind
(That’s why I) Can’t understand why cat’s be hurryin’ time
And I don’t wanna grow up I’m a Crab Apple Kid
And I enjoy the company of people I relate wit’
But if it comes down to it, to deal with cat’s that I despise
I just close my eyes and drift away to Eighty-Five

In your brown eyes, you'll watch her go
Then turn the record on and wonder what went wrong
What went wrong?

[Chorus 1]
If everything was everything, but everything is over
Everything could be everything if only we were older
I guess it's just a silly song about you
And how I lost you and your brown eyes

[Verse 2]
In your brown eyes, I was feeling low
'Cause they're brown eyes, and you never know
Got some brown eyes, but I saw her face
I knew that it was wrong, so baby, turn the record on
Play that song

Where everything was everything, but everything is over
Everything could be everything if only we were older
I guess it's just a silly song about you
And how I lost you and your brown eyes
Brown eyes

[Chorus 2]
Everything was everything, but baby it's the last show
Everything could be everything, but it's time to say goodbye
So get your last fix and your last hit, grab your old girl with her new tricks

Need a man who likes it rough, likes it rough, likes it rough

The Fashion of His Love
Oh, yeah
(Oh) I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
(Oh) 'Cause baby, I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love

[Verse 2]
You know that I'd never cheat on a man
'Cause I'm not like that
I'm physically crafted to be as fitting as McQueen
But when it comes to clothing, I'm bad
I'm fashionably just designed to be grand
Oh, and he's no accessory to me
-Ry to me, no, no, no!

[Bridge]
No, I just can't seem to forget you
No, I can't for just as long as I met you
You're my babe right through
I was made for you

[Chorus]
(Oh) I'm seeing all the signs from above
(Oh) I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
Oh, yeah
(Oh) I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
(Oh) 'Cause baby, I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love

[Bridge]
They say I need a strong man, not just a friend
But baby, my search is done
No longer reason to cry or to justify
How I feel for you, my love

[Breakdown]
I'm seeing all the signs from above
I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him...
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
(Oh) I'm seeing all the signs from above
(Oh) I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
Oh, yeah
(Oh) I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
(Oh) 'Cause baby, I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
Oh, yeah
(Oh) I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
(Oh) 'Cause baby, I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely run, on the road to love
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love

[Interlude]
Run run, with her t-
Run run, with her t-
Run run, with her t-
Run run, with her t-
Run run, with her t-
Run run, with her t-
Run run, with her t-

[Verse 1]
Run run, with her top down, baby, she flies
Run run, with the fury of a saint in her eyes
Run run, ha-cha cha cha, baby, she goes
With blonde hair and a gun smoking under her toes

[Pre-Chorus]
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah oh-oh-oo-oh
Ride ride, pony, ride ride
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah oh-oh-oo-oh

Out on this lonely run, on the road to love
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love

[Post-Chorus]
I'm on the road, I'm on the road to love
I'm on the road, I'm on the road to love

[Verse 2]
She's just an American, riding a dream
When she's got a rainbow syrup in her heart that she bleeds
She don't care if your papers or your love is the law
She's a free soul burning roads, with a flag in her bra

[Pre-Chorus]
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah oh-oh-oo-oh
Ride ride, pony, ride ride
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah
Hoah-oo-woah-oo-woah oh-oh-oo-oh
Ride ride, pony, tonight

[Chorus]
We can be strong, we can be strong
Out on this lonely run, on the road to love
We can be strong, we can be strong
Follow that unicorn on the road to love

[Post-Chorus]
I'm on the road, I'm on the road to love
I'm on the road, I'm on the road to love

[Bridge]
Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause we're gonna fall in love tonight
Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause we're gonna drink until we die
Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause we're gonna fall in love tonight
Get your hot rods ready to rumble
'Cause we're gonna drink until we die

[Verse 1]
My body is sanctuary
My blood is pure
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
You want me bad
I think you're cool, but I'm not sure
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Follow me, don't be such a holy fool
Follow me, I need something more from you
It's not about sex or champagne, you holy fool
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Chorus]
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place
C'mon, meet me in Electric Chapel

[Verse 2]
Confess to me, where you have been
Next to the bar
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Pray for your sins right under the glass disco ball
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Follow me, don't be such a holy fool
Follow me, I need something sacred from you
Together, we'll both find a way
To make a pure love work in a dirty way

[Chorus]
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place
C'mon, meet me in Electric Chapel

[Break]
Oh, oh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Oh, oh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Oh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Meet me, meet me, meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me

[Chorus]
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
(Meet me, meet me)
Oh, if you wanna, meet me at Electric Chapel
(Meet me, meet me)
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place
C'mon, meet me in Electric Chapel

[Outro]
Oh
Meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
It’s been a long time since I came around
Been a long time, but I’m back in town
This time I'm not leaving without you
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me, oh
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I'm not leaving without you

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
He said, "Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,"
There’s...

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & (Brian May)]
(Something), something about this place
(Something), something, ‘bout lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah, there's something about, baby, you and I

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
It’s been two years since I let you go
I couldn’t listen to a joke or a Rock and Roll
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart
On my birthday you sang me "Heart of Gold"
With a guitar humming and no clothes
This time I’m not leaving without you

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
"Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,"
There’s...

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & (Brian May)]
(There's something), something about this place
(Something), something, ‘bout lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah, there's something about, baby, you and I

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You and I
You, you and I
You, you and I
You, you and I, I
You and I
You, you and I
Oh yeah, well, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I
C'mon! Put your drinks up!

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
We got a whole lot of money, but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in Heaven
There's only three men that I'ma serve my whole life
It's my daddy, and Nebraska, and Jesus Christ
There's...

[Chorus: Lady Gaga & (Brian May)]
(Something), something, something about the chase
Six whole years
I'm a New York woman born to run you down
Still want my lipstick all over your face
Something, something about
Just knowing when it's right
So put your drinks up, for Nebraska
For Nebraska, Nebraska, I love ya

[Final Chorus: Lady Gaga & Brian May]
You and I
You, you and I
Baby, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I
You and I
You, you and I
Nebraska, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I

[Outro: Lady Gaga]
It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time, but I'm back in town
And this time I'm not leaving without you

[Verse 1]
Oh, tonight I'm gonna show them what I'm made of, oh
The killer queen inside me's coming to say "hello"
Oh, tonight I will return
The fame and riches earned
With you, I'd watch them all be burned
Woah, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Whenever I start feeling strong
I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14 karat guns to win
I am a woman, I insist, it's my life

[Chorus]
I can be the queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release
And be brave for you, you'll see
I can be, the queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
I've dreamed, it's happening
I can be the queen

[Verse 2]
I am wind and hurricane, the stormy sky and rain
When you run dry, I'll flood your pain
Woah, woah
In between the moments of the lady I've become
A voice speaks through the noise like drums
Rum-pum-pum-pum

[Pre-Chorus]
Whenever I start feeling strong
I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14 karat guns to win
I am a woman, I insist, it's my life

[Chorus]
I can be the queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release
And be brave for you, you'll see
I can be, the queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
I've dreamed, it's happening
I can be the queen
The que ee-ee-ee-ee ee-ee-eeen
The queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen

[Bridge]
Starry night
Come inside me, like never before
Don't forget me when I come crying to Heaven's door
I will fly
On a challenger across the sky
Like a phoenix, so you can remind them of the dream I bore

[Outro]
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh

[Intro]
We don't care what people say, we know the truth
Enough is enough of this horse shit
I am not a freak, I was born with my free gun
Don't tell me I'm less than my freedom

[Verse 1]
I'm a bitch
I'm a loser, baby, maybe I should quit
I'm a jerk
Wish I had the money, but I can't find work
I'm a brat
I'm a selfish punk, I really should be smacked
My parents tried
'Til they got divorced 'cause I ruined their lives

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a bad kid, and I will survive
Oh, I'm a bad kid
Don't know wrong from right (Know wrong from right)
I'm a bad kid, and this is my life, one of the bad kids
Don't know wrong from right (This is my life)

[Chorus]
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure

[Verse 2]
I'm a twit
Degenerate, young rebel and I'm proud of it
Pump your fist if you would rather mess up than put up with this
I'm a nerd
I chew gum and smoke in your face, I'm absurd
I'm so bad
And I don't give a damn, I love it when you're mad
When you're mad, when you're mad

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a bad kid, and I will survive
Oh, I'm a bad kid
Don't know wrong from right (Know wrong from right)
I'm a bad kid, and this is my life, one of the bad kids
Don't know wrong from right (This is my life)

[Chorus]
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure

[Bridge]
I'm not that typical baby
I'm a bad kid like my mom and dad made me
I'm not that "cool and you hate me"
I'm a bad kid, that's the way that they made me
I'm a bad kid, I'm disastrous
Give me your money or I'll hold my breath
I'm a bad kid, and I will survive
One of the bad kids don't know wrong from right

[Chorus]
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby

[Outro]
A bad kid baby
A bad kid baby
A bad kid baby

[Verse 1]
And the hardest part
Was letting go not taking part
Was the hardest part
And the strangest thing
Was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start

[Chorus]
I could feel it go down
Bittersweet I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the clouds
Oh and I...
I wish that I could work it out

[Verse 2]
And the hardest part
Was letting go not taking part
You really broke my heart, oh
And I tried to sing
But I couldn't think of anything
And that was the hardest part, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I can feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
You're a silver lining the clouds
Oh and I...
Oh and I...
I wonder what it's all about
I wonder what it's all about

[Verse 3]
Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it just comes undone
And everything is torn apart
Oh and that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part
Yeah that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part

[Intro: Piano Solo]

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Everywhere I'm turning, nothing seems complete
I stand up and I'm searching for the better part of me
I hang my head from sorrow, slave to humanity
I wear it on my shoulders, gotta find strength in me
(Why is that?)

[Chorus]
'Cause I am a Superwoman
Yes, I am (Yes, she is)
Still when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an "S" on my chest
Oh, yes, I'm a Superwoman

[Verse 2]
(This is for)
For all the mothers fighting
For better days to come
And all my women, all my women sitting here trying
To come home before the sun
And all my sisters coming together
Say "Yes, I will," "Yes, I can"
(Why is that?)

[Chorus]
'Cause I am a Superwoman
Yes, I am (Yes, she is)
Still when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an "S" on my chest
Oh yes, I'm a Superwoman

[Bridge]
When I'm breaking down and I can't be found
As I start to get weak
'Cause no one knows me underneath these clothes
But I can fly
We can fly, ohh

[Chorus]
'Cause I am a Superwoman
Yes, I am (Yes, she is)
Still when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an "S" on my chest
Oh yes, I'm a Superwoman (Yes, she is)
Oh, let me tell you, I am Superwoman, yes, I am (Yes, she is)
Oh, yeah
'Cause even when I'm a mess
I still put on a vest
With an "S" on my chest
Oh yes, I'm Superwoman (Yes, I am)
Said I'm a Superwoman (Yes, she is)
Hey yeah, oh yeah

[Outro]
I'm super, I'm super
Yes, I am, yeah (Yes, we are)
Yes, I am
(Yes, you are)
Oh

[Intro]
I, I can't really explain what is is she does
But um, yeah, whatever it is, it's um
Whatever it is, it's simply amazing

[Verse 1]
Her head is on my chest, the sun comes rolling in
We're lost in these covers, and all I feel is skin
I slowly kiss your face
Beautiful in every way, you are

[Pre-Chorus]
See I'm a man that don't believe in much
But I'll be damned if I don't believe in us
And how we play fight up in the bathroom
Next thing you know I'm making love to you
Girl, promise me you'll never change

[Chorus]
She ain't perfect but she's worth it
Every breath I breathe for the life of me
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me and it's simply amazing, you are
Simply amazing, you are
Simply amazing, you are
And she loves me and it's simply amazing
Amazing, mazing

[Verse 2]
The girl's a work of art and I can't help but stare
With the smile like the sunset and an ocean as her hair
Ooh, what she do ain't fair
Ooh and she know me better than I know myself

[Pre-Chorus]
See I'm a man, that don't believe in much
But I'd be damned, if I don't believe in us
Like when I said "I love you" for the first time
And the tears dropped from your eyes
Girl, don't you ever change, no

[Chorus]
She ain't perfect but she's worth it
Every breath I breathe for the life of me
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me and it's simply amazing, you are
Simply amazing, you are
Simply amazing, you are
And she loves me

[Bridge]
There is nothing in this world
That can keep me away from you
And there's nobody
Who could ever compare to you, oh

[Chorus]
She ain't perfect but she's worth it
Every breath I breathe for the life of me
And I know I might not deserve it
But she loves me and it's simply amazing, you are
Simply amazing, you are
Simply amazing, you are
And she loves me and it's simply amazing

[Intro]
They say I smoke too much
I say you can't smoke enough in this bitch

[Verse]
OG kush in my eyelids, high as fuck I'm like wireless
Ain't playing a game, I'm not childish
Taylor gang we the wildest, taking shots like I'm Irish
Going to shop for that fly shit, if it's private I'm flying it
If I like it, I'm buying it, if its foreign, I'm drivin' it
If it's potent, I'm smoking it
That 69 interior look sexy as hell when you open it
If that kush good, I might roll a bit, wife happy I'm stroking it
Cover of the source cause my ownership, hating niggas like holy shit
Club promoters like fly him out, die hard fans like pay the man
150k for a show, I rub my hands like Birdman
Ripping jeans and taking drags, popping tags and making swag
On the internet everyday and you fuck niggas still make us laugh
I ain't really one to talk shit, but the shit I buy just make us brag
Clothes small but my money long
With my gold tooth and my nappy head
Before you see, you thinking that's a seat
But a nigga like me treat it like a bed
Wake me up when it's time to eat, only nigga in first class
Haha

[Chorus]
I say fuck you unless I'm with you
Though I will probably never diss
You want me to roll and smoke with you
Don't lie (Don't lie)
I say fuck them other niggas
Man, I'm down for all my niggas, 'cause they down to ride
Lil nigga say word
You ain't ever smoke no fire, you ain't never smoke no fire
Lil nigga, tell the truth
You ain't ever smoke no fire, you ain't ever smoke no fire
Lil nigga, tell the truth
You ain't ever smoke no fire, nigga you a goddamn liar
BASEDGOD WAS RIGHT. we’re all a bunch of golden million dollar babies. my hope is that the babies born these days will inherit less of the bullshit than we did. anyhow, what i’m about to post is for anyone who cares to read. it was intended to fill the thank you’s section in my album credits, but with all the rumors going round.. I figured it’d be good to clarify…

Whoever you are. Wherever you are… I’m starting to think we’re a lot alike. Human beings spinning on blackness. All wanting to be seen, touched, heard, paid attention to. My loved ones are everything to me here. In the last year or 3 I’ve screamed at my creator, screamed at clouds in the sky, for some explanation. Mercy maybe. For peace of mind to rain like manna somehow. 4 summers ago, I met somebody. I was 19 years old. He was too. We spent that summer, and the summer after, together. Everyday almost. And on the days we were together, time would glide. Most of the day I’d see him, and his smile. I’d hear his conversation and his silence…until it was time to sleep. Sleep I would often share with him. By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless. There was no escaping, no negotiating with the feeling. No choice. It was my first love, it changed my life. Back then, my mind would wander to the women I had been with, the ones I cared for and thought I was in love with. I reminisced about the sentimental songs I enjoyed when I was a teenager.. The ones I played when I experienced a girlfriend for the first time. I realised they were written in a language I did not yet speak. I realised too much, too quickly. Imagine being thrown from a plane. I wasn’t in a plane though. I was in a Nissan Maxima, the same car I packed up with bags and drove to Los Angeles in. I sat there and told my friend how I felt. I wept as the words left my mouth. I grieved for them, knowing I could never take them back for myself. He patted my back. He said kind things. He did his best, but he wouldn’t admit the same. He had to go back inside soon, it was late and his girlfriend was waiting for him upstairs. He wouldn’t tell the truth about his feelings for me for another 3 years. I felt like I’d only imagined reciprocity for years. Now imagine being thrown from a cliff. No, I wasn’t on a cliff. I was still in my car telling myself it was gonna be fine and to take deep breaths. I took the breaths and carried on. I kept up a peculiar friendship with him because I couldn’t imagine keeping up my life without him. I struggled to master myself and my emotions. I wasn’t always successful

The dance went on.. I kept the rhythm for several summers after. It’s winter now. I’m typing this on a plane back to Los Angeles from New Orleans. I flew home for another marred Christmas. I have a windowseat. It’s December 27, 2011. By now I’ve written two albums. This being the second. I wrote to keep myself busy and sane. I wanted to create worlds that were rosier than mine. I tried to channel overwhelming emotions. I’m surprised at how far all of it has taken me. Before writing this I’d told some people my story. I’m sure these people kept me alive, kept me safe. Sincerely, these are the folks I wanna thank from the floor of my heart. Everyone of you knows who you are.. Great humans, probably angels. I don’t know what happens now, and that’s alrite. I don’t have any secrets I need kept anymore. There’s probably some small shit still, but you know what I mean. I was never alone, as much as it felt like it. As much as I still do sometimes. I never was. I don’t think I ever could be. Thanks. To my first love, I’m grateful for you. Grateful that even though it wasn’t what I hoped for and even though it was never enough, it was. Some things never are.. and we were. I won’t forget you. I won’t forget the summer. I’ll remember who I was when I met you. I’ll remember who you were and how we’ve both changed and stayed the same. I’ve never had more respect for life and living than I have right now. Maybe it takes a near death experience to feel alive. Thanks. To my mother. You raised me strong. I know I’m only brave because you were first. So thank you. All of you. For everything good. I feel like a free man. If I listen closely.. I can hear the sky falling too

[Intro: Kanye West]
What are they gon' tell me?

Like what 2 shots to the dome does
Plus you kind of slow man
But if we listen to you
We all be broke like Gary Coleman
I'm trying to blow like Pokémane
And I don't want to have to choke you man
I'd rather go to bed, getting head on the sofa man
Yo but, aigh, it's over man

Nothing's gonna stop Nothing's gonna stop Nothing's gonna stop me!
(I said) Nothing's gonna stop Nothing's gonna stop Nothing's gonna stop me!

I get all of your guns before you get me
Go to the army, trying to find me
But that ain’t going to happen 'cause you can’t track me
I’m bad, I'm better, I'm even more fed up
With nothing to lose but my bootleg sweater
You can call the government and call me terror
But I say your trick is to get more cheddar

[Chorus]
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad

[Bridge]
I try, I try, try to be good, yeah I try
I try, I try, try to be good, yeah I try
I try, I try, try to be good, yeah I try
I try, I try, try to be good, yeah I try

[Verse 3]
You're fucked and corrupt, and you know I'm just bad
You say "give peace a chance", I save peace a seat for chance
You punks play pranks cause your campaign works on grants
That's why I make them bounce and hide out in the south of France

[Chorus]
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad

[Outro]
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, I'm bad

[Verse 1]
In the next world war
In a jackknifed juggernaut
I am born again
In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again

[Chorus]
In an interstellar burst
I'm back to save the universe

[Verse 2]
In a deep, deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life

[Chorus]
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

[Childish Gambino]
Street niggas, hood rats, ladies and gentlemen
Childish Gambino greater than sign everyone
Apples to oranges, Jay Leno to Letterman
Got a cool whip and my girl ass gelatin
"Fake niggas back in style" no never that
If I'm wrong, see you in hell with hella cash
God dammit we the boys with the illest rain
Royalty forever and the rest is just a silly game
Still learnin' how to work your girlfriend's genitals
Still buyin' sweaters off of 30 Rock residuals
Money change everything, these bitches always down to ride
Especially if you keep they nose gentrified
Money off of curse words, I hope my mama's proud of me
Man, I've done it all, so I guess we both prodigies
From PJs to PJs, that's projects to privates
Now you understand my fuckin' mindset, let 'em know

[Prodigy]
I know you want my head to roll, my body on that dirty curb
My rap music's dead and gone, niggas want me in the dirt
I bust your little bubble, shatter your dreams
And push you over in my bottomless pit of sixteens
Alchemist rapper transform on your shape-shift
Cause if it never dawned on you, I'm a snake bitch
The great serpent is tatted on my fist
Kundalini Key on the pyramid
This is meditated murder, my aura that over-lifer
He escaped out the belly like it's been a long time, son
Surprise son, I'm back for you motherfuckas' soul you owe me
We made a blood pact when you stole my style
Nigga straight bit my swag
But I'm a demon, I get even when I take mine's back
I'm a god in the flesh, all this power I possess
I crush you little pussies like sex, who's next?

[Childish Gambino]
I'm sittin' on a bunch of green faces
So my wallet is an alien invasion
Or a spaceship, my crew's the illest
So we Aaahh!!! real monsters, Nicktoons Ickis
That line's the stupidest, but it be lucrative
I'm sellin' out these venues, niggas gotta get used to it
Now fuckin' with the realest that you ever had
And P my motherfuckin' nigga so I call him dad

[Prodigy]
Yeah I'm a motherfucker too, birthed a lot of sons
Get a lot of money, spent it on a lot of guns
I'm trying to change, I don't want to scare away execs
Clean me up, but you can't change what's in my head

[Childish Gambino]
Killin’ Glenlivet, Dom P said it
My flow go to earth, we the ill pandemic
We smoke the whole barn up, bitch I'm on my high horse
You don't watch Community? Girl, what is you lyin' for?

[Prodigy]
Bitch, I got immunity
Out here in the jungle of concrete
Where I hustle gettin' all these rhymes off
Hoes wanna jump, but I don't want your little dyke
I'm too preoccupied with this good life

[Childish Gambino]
I want a hood life, cash and clothes
Fast as hoes, then get ghosts like Casper though
Smash 'em though, they don't know what hit 'em
Childish Gambino, show a nigga that you with him say "ayo"

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I bet you're wondering how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I love you more
It took me by surprise, I must say
When I found out yesterday
Don't you know that

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)

[Verse 2]
I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life you see
Because you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love someone else
Instead

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)

[Verse 3]
People say "believe half of what you see
Son and none of what you hear"
But I can't help being confused
If it's true please tell me dear:
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?
Don't you know

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine, baby
I heard it through the grapevine
I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)

[Outro]
Honey, Honey, I know (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)
That you're letting me go (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said I heard it through the grapevine (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)
Oh, heard it thought the grapevine (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Intro]
Aye, listen
It's Lonny
Wait a sec
Okay, go

[Verse 1]
Hey let me tell you something
Don't be frontin' like he ever did it like I does it
Every time you wanna argue and stress
You always say you could've stayed with your ex
Well I guess you coulda'
But deep inside I know that you don't wish you woulda'
'Coz when you was with him
You was always checking for the kid
Late night coming to my crib

[Chorus]
I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
With a swag like me
He ain't quite me, like me
I, I, I, I, I know you better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I, I, I, I, I know you better

[Verse 2]
So so so, tell, tell me, tell me something
You really think it'd be that easy just to let me go
I know I try to play it cool when we fuss
But truth be told, my heart would be crushed
(Cuz it's just for you)
I'm tryin to settle down
(Tell me who)
You know could make you smile
(Like I can do)
Tell me who, tell me who

[Chorus]
I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
With a swag like me
Like me, like me
I, I know that you'll never finda
I, I, I, I, I know you better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I, I, I, I, I know you better

[Bridge]
So, so, so
Baby I know
That without you I'd be broken down
But you'd feel the same
If I went away
Why can't you just say it?
Just say it! Just say it!
Forget it baby, it's cool
Cuz I already know

[Chorus]
I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
With a swag like me
He ain't quite me, like me
I, I, I, I, I know you better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I, I, I, I, I know you better

I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
With a swag like me
Like me, like me
I, I, I, I, I know you better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I, I, I, I, I know you better
Cold blooded nigga, hoes love a nigga
She said she only fuck me and no other nigga
Don’t believe her but it’s nice to hear
Never ever thought life was fair
But I’m quite prepared
The boy nice cause he writes sincere
Draw straight from the heart send it right to ears
Think smart, play your part like Tyson here
Nigga I cheated death twice this year
I got the right to wear ice and swear like I never went to college
Or get direct deposits that could never fit in wallets
Clever but I’m ghetto tho I never lived in projects
On a level with the pilots, fuck the devil
This the hottest shit you’ll ever get to ride with
Though you’ll never get beside it
Got it, flow psychotic
Fruits of my labour, ya’ll hoped I rotted
Backpack and mainstream, both how I got it
Nas and Hov at the same damn time
Pac and BIG in the same damn mind
You can have a lot of whips and you can have a lot of chips
And you can have a lot of bitches but you can’t have mine

[Intro]
Runaway, did I make you runaway? Did I make you runaway?
How many people came with the one they love tonight?
Runaway, did I make you runaway? Did I make you runaway?
How many people came with the one they love tonight?

[Verse 1]
You know love ain't always gon' be easy
Especially when people in your business like the way they do Yeezy
And ladies? I know you girls gon' be
Always talk 'bout what he did
Fellas? I know you guys
Always talk 'bout what she did
Y'all be going through up's and down's
Havin' fights and shit
I want you do a favor
First of all, just for the ladies
I just want you do me more favor
And y'all please now checking e-mails, cause I
Got it in the e-mails so guys get away with shit and some
I'm just serious, I'm just serious, I'm just serious
But for real 'bout tonight

[Chorus]
If you love someone tonight hold onto'em real tight
If you love somebody tonight hold onto'em real tight, real tight, real tight
If you love someone tonight hold onto'em real tight
If you love somebody tonight hold onto'em real tight, real tight, real tight

[Verse 2]
Cause I always find, yeah I always find
If I told you I can make ... tonight
Don't listen to me baby cause I'm an asshole
And you always find, and you always find
Yeah I always find, yeah I always find
If I told you I can make the way to heaven tonight
Don't listen to me baby cause I'm an asshole
And you always find, yeah you always find
Yeah I always find, yeah I always find
If I told you I won every single bill 'bout you every minute I had to
Don't listen to me cause I'm an asshole
And you always found and the one place I fucked up
I thought you'd always be mine, I thought you'd always be mine
I thought you'd always be mine and if I say I didn't love you, I was lying
I swear to God I was lying, I swear to God I was lying
I swear to God I was lying, I swear to God I was lying

[Bridge]
So do me a favor

[Chorus]
If you love someone tonight hold onto'em real tight
If you love somebody tonight hold onto'em real tight, real tight, real tight
If you love someone tonight hold onto'em real tight
If you love somebody tonight hold onto'em real tight, real tight, real tight

[Verse 1]
New shit alert! New clothes
Got a new whip, homie I got two of those
Got some green, homie we got UFO's
We the new chick, Royalty man, you ain't know?
Somebody tell 'em we ain't never going nowhere
Mr. CEO, I give a fuck about a co-chair
He fly, no fair, tell 'em how we did it, though
Droppin' with the hottest shit, no time to do the video
ATL is my city, though, East Side bitch
Getting Cortez at Stonecrest, I'm East Side rich
But my old girl Laconia, my house California
You ain't heard the news? D-Money back on ya
Niggas wanna network, cause I'm the only rapper with his face on a network
Fuckin' check my net worth tell 'em what the check's worth
Go and let 'em know
Touch down and I leave your city tore up
Then I'm coming home to my girls on the tour bus
But then I'm gone again, more shows, more bucks
Ten times your cut, bein' broke sure sucks
Opportunity, I've never seen a door shut
Get it for my fam so my daddy ain't a Warbuck
Summer coming so I hit 'em with the warm up
Ballin' in my sweat suit, I'm tryin' to get my form up
I ain't think we was ballin' 'til private jets to New Orleans
My girlfriend on and on 'em, caught 'em fallin' like Autumn
God damnit, yeah get up on it yeah man the truth hurts
Think fast, shoot first, beast like blue fur
All we do is do this, yeah

[Break]
Ay, ay
Childish Gambino
Here we go, Harry Fraud
Yo we got a shout out for him
Yo

[Verse 2]
Jesus, he's still around? That makes two of us
Rappers who fuckin' hate me still wanna stop my tour bus
Rappers who call me gimmick still post me and troll the comments
20 shots of that honesty, I'm tryin' to control the vomit
Ugh, nauseum, eat a dick, all of 'em
'Bino does it feel good? Is East Side still hood?
Haters never mutual, boy that's for your man's sake
I don't see it like a Pusha-T and Wayne handshake
Pop or flop mobsters, we ain't do neither
Why these dudes want a mixtape, Shaq Diesel?
The truth is what you make it and lately, it's hard to find
Will they remember "Heartbeat" like it was "Party All the Time"?
I know, I know, I know, it's that run it back
I just rocked 10K, where my hundred at?
My homie reppin' K.Flay at the Summer Jam
And they show me love somethin' serious
And I was just a kid, man, I ain't think they hearin' us
And Mase shook my hand and I'm shook
Cause my man still with Biggie and Gambino just a fan
I'mma tell you something true
If you ain't got a bunch of haters, man, then you ain't doing you
And this fake fuckin' rappers wanna fire shots for no reason
I could've helped you, but fuck it, I'm callin' open season
This ain't subliminal, I'm comin' right at you
But no one knows who you are, so I'm rapping at fuckin' statues
You gassed cause you got a meetin'? Crew is a never heard of you
Your drive is a learner's permit, your beef is a veggie burger
Verbal murder? Nah, we just tell what the truth homie
I'm with my girl in Spain, what are you doing?
Fuck it boy, we don't get enough joy
Watchin' everyone I know makin' major bok choy
Royalty, only two of us are fuckin' rappers
Another runs Wordpress, another does Apple
Another's DT and drinkin', talkin', on that cheddar
You wonder who we are, that means you already met us
I'm everywhere nigga, I don't need the fuckin' throne
I don't need Illuminati, I could fucking start my own

[Outro]
Cause I'm Childish, Childish, Childish
Childish Gambino
Westwood, Westwood, so its all good
Yo Childish Gambino, East Side let 'em know

[Verse 1]
It's a holiday, yeah
Spend it with you, baby
I think that I'm in love this Christmas, yeah
Just hanging stockings on the fireplace
You know that Santa's coming to town
I'm the one who wants to take you on a sleigh ride now
So today's all about Cupid, the mistletoe can pull us closer
It's what I'm waiting for, it sorta feels like it's Valentine's, Valentine's

[Pre-Chorus]
So land on top of your roof, them sleigh bells is ringing
I'll be up all night with you, them carols are singing
Japan to Peru, baby, me and you
This Christmas Eve

[Chorus]
Be my date this Christmas Eve
Be my holiday, my dream
Lay your head on me, I got you, babe (Whoa, whoa)
Kissing underneath the tree
I don't need no presents girl, you're everything I need
Let me give you all of me each year
Together on this Christmas Eve

[Verse 2]
You leave some cookies out, I'mma eat 'em all
Nobody can see me but you, it's so magical, oh-oh
When we use imagination, we can fly to Never-Neverland
(Neverland)
The north pole ain't that cold, if you wanna go, I got you baby, girl

[Chorus]
Be my date this Christmas Eve
Be my holiday, my dream
Lay your head on me, I got you, babe (Whoa, whoa)
Kissing underneath the tree
I don't need no presents girl, you're everything I need
Let me give you all of me each year
Together on this Christmas Eve

[Bridge]
Be my, be my, Christmas Eve
Be be be, be my, be my, Christmas Christmas
Be be be, be my, be my, Christmas Eve
Be be, I promise I won't do you wrong

[Chorus]
Be my date this Christmas Eve (Be my baby)
Be my holiday, my dream (Oh, whoa)
Lay your head on me, I got you, babe (Whoa, no no, oh no)
Kissing underneath the tree (I just want you right here)
I don't need no presents girl, you're everything I need (Oh-oh)
Let me give you all of me each year
Together on this Christmas Eve

[Outro]
Be my, be my, Christmas Eve
Be be be, be my, be my, Christmas Christmas
Be be be, be my, be my, Christmas Eve
Be be

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Got these niggas sayin': shit ain't even logical
To do the shit I do, now lets celebrate the impossible
Glasses up, I'm respected son
Unbelievable arsenal
Beat the streets with bars til niggas lay in the hospital
In case you didn't know everything about me phenomenal
And the way these niggas talk everything about it is comical
Whats even more comical, is what you read in an article
I broke your face for talkin', you should've been more responsible
You need to learn I ain't trying to stop, basically
Watch them choke when I'm pullin' up in a space ship, see?
When I float you see how we ballin' until we wasted
Mad because I poke your broad and be lettin' her taste it
Please appreciate this art and this Basquiat that I'm painting
Embrace a lot of love, but I love embracing the hatred
You niggas is the fuel for me
Leaving it mutilated
Pardon my delay on all of this greatness you ever waited

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Now when I'm lookin' at the game I say shit done changed
These niggas going out they way but I'm just staying the same
You probably thinking that you seen someone like me before
But I'm a G and they don't make em like me anymore

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
The nerve of these niggas
Talkin' shit about me cause I'm on the top I ain't even heard of these niggas
Smokin' kill dressed to murder these niggas
Want beef? Cause I got bread
I guess you where burgers be nigga
They say I'm the event currently
But my niggas in the cut like surgery
And all my breakfasts, lunch, and dinners get served to me
You sayin' I ain't the realest, that's perjury
I'm smokin' out with my niggas up on the top floor of the villa lookin' out for those who be trynna copy us
Oh you ain't bout them dollars huh?
I guess that mean we can't chop it up
Pérignon poppin'
30k for watches
I grinded for what I got my nigga, losings not an option
Just look at all this new shit that I'm rockin'
Don't know whatchu doin', you should stop then

[Hook]

[Verse 1: John Legend]
Ain’t this what you came for
Don’t you wish you came more
Girl what you playing for, come on
Come on, let me kiss that
Oooh, know you miss that
What’s wrong let me fix that
Twist that

[Hook: John Legend]
Baby tonight’s the night I let you go
Baby tonight’s the night we lose control
Baby tonight you need that
Tonight believe that
Tonight I’ll be the best you ever had
I don’t want to brag but I’ll be
The best you ever had
I don’t want to brag but I’ll be
The best you ever had

[Verse 2: John Legend]
I hit you with the best stroke
Freestyle and the breast stroke
‘Til you blowing cigarette smoke
And now the beds broke
So what we gon’ do now
Fuckin' Round Two now
Work it out then we cool down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pusha-T]
Might not pull your chair out
Calendars I clear out
No relaxers, I pay to grow your hair out
His and her everything pull ‘em pairs out
Them pink pink Louboutin's, pull them reds out
Never sweat air fare when the lear's near
Through the clouds sky blue like a care bear
Your first time you a virgin to these airlines
I don’t mean to brag but compare mine
Roadsters, chauffeurs, take your pick
Have ya kickin’ either two, baby make a wish
Anything you ever wanted you could make a list
The only reason you ain’t got it ‘cuz it don’t exist
Took a chance, hit or miss
Homerun, friends with benefits
We fight and make love I like you better mad
Truly yours, "the best you ever had"

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
What if there was no light?
Nothing wrong, nothing right?
What if there was no time?
And no reason or rhyme?
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side?
That you don't want me there in your life?

[Verse 2]
What if I got it wrong?
And no poem or song
Could put right what I got wrong
Or make you feel I belong
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side?
That you don't want me there in your life?

[Chorus]
Oooooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Oooooh, that's right
How can you know it if you don't even try?
Oooooh, that's right

[Verse 3]
Every step that you take
Could be your biggest mistake
It could bend or it could break
But that's the risk that you take
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there in your life?
That you don't want me there by your side?

[Chorus]
Oooooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Oooooh, that's right
How can you know it when you don't even try?
Oooooh, that's right

[Outro]
Oh, Oooooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Oooooh, that's right
You know that darkness always turns into light
Oooooh, that's right

[Verse 1]
Oh, brother, I can't, I can't get through
I've been trying hard to reach you
‘Cause I don't know what to do
Oh, brother, I can't believe it's true
I'm so scared about the future and I wanna talk to you
Oh, I wanna talk to you

[Chorus]
You could take a picture of something you see
In the future, where will I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do
Something that's never been done

[Verse 2]
Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle
You can't find your missing piece?
Tell me how you feel
Well, I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak
And they're talking it to me

[Chorus]
So, you take a picture of something you see
In the future, where will I be?
You could climb a ladder up to the sun
Or write a song nobody had sung
Or do
Something that's never been done
Do
Something that's never been done

[Outro]
So, you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk
And you feel like you're going where you've been before
You'll tell anyone who'll listen, but you feel ignored
Nothing's really making any sense at all
Let's talk, let's talk, let's talk, let's talk

[Verse 1]
You're in control, is there anywhere you wanna go?
You're in control, is there anything you wanna know?
The future's for discovering
The space in which we're travelling

[Chorus]
From the top of the first page
To the end of the last day
From the start in your own way
You just want...
Somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are

[Verse 2]
Under the surface trying to break through
Deciphering the codes in you
I need a compass, draw me a map
I'm on the top I can't get back
Woah, woah

[Chorus]
First line of the first page
To the end of the last day
You were looking
From the start in your own way
You just want...
Somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter who you are

[Bridge]
Oooh
You just want somebody listening to what you say
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter who you are

[Outro]
Is there anybody out there who is lost and hurt and lonely too?
Are they bleeding all your colours into one?
And if you come undone as if you'd been run through
Some catapult it fired you
You wonder if your chance will ever come
Well, if you're stuck in square one
Jeb, get away from the barbecue, man
Don, get the hell away from that thing
Dunce, give me a kiss
Won't you come and give me a kiss?

[Verse 1]
How he makes her feel
When he look her in the eyes and tell her
I love you, yeah
He seems so for real
When he whispers and says
I'll never leave you, no
And he speaks them words to her heart
And make her feel like she on top
Of the world, yeah, oh my
Then turn around and break her heart
And make her feel like the whole world's on top of her, whoa
And now something other made me talk about it

[Hook]
When a man lies, he pierces the very soul of that woman
Yes he does, yeah
I'm just telling the truth
When a man lies, he kills every reason
She ever had for loving him, yeah
Mirror I'm talking to you, yeah

[Verse 2]
How he promised her things
While he's making sweet love to her mind
Selling big dreams, yeah
That's what he do, or he can paint the scene
With every word out of his mouth
Make her wanna believe, oh she believes

That everything that he says is true
Now all the dreams she bought and the tales he told
Cinderella to the old pot of gold
Broke up for a heart and stole the glory
And it let me here to tell the story

[Hook]
When a man lies
He pierces the very soul of that woman
Yes he does, hey
I'm just telling the truth
When a man lies
He kills every reason
She ever had for loving him, yeah
Mirror I'm talking to you, yeah

[Bridge]
Hey now don't ya all shoot the messenger
I was sent here to deliver
Y'all can go ahead and call me a lawyer
'Cause today I'll represent, the woman

[Hook]
Cause when a man lies
He pierces the very soul of that woman
Yes he does, hey
I'm just telling the truth
When a man lies
He kills every reason
She ever had for loving him, yeah
Mirror I'm talking to you, yeah
I don't know how to make it stop
I don't know how to make it stop
I don't know how to make it stop
(Nooo)

I got a phobia when it comes to heights
Even if it's a first class flight
And as a kid, I never really liked to climb
If you pushed me hard on a swing, then I'd cry
If I had a dream that I was flying
Then I'd wake up in a panic, screaming

And now you take me up and away with you
Push me out of the plane with no parachute
And now I'm gonna need somebody to catch me

It's like I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)
I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)
It's like I'm falling form the sky (sky, sky)
And I need somebody to catch me
Catch me, when I come down (down, down, down)
When I come down (down, down, down)
When I come down (down, down, down)
Will you catch me?
When I come down (down, down, down)
When I come down
I never ever wanted to climb a ladder
And I never wanted a house in the hills
I'm comfortable living in a big high rise
Cause in nightmares of getting killed
I never wanted to swim, the water there was too deep
Put me up on the roof, you couldn't pay me to leap
Even if I was bummin' on the streets of Chi
You couldn't pay me to leap

And now you take me up and away with you
Push me out of the plane with no parachute
And now I'm gonna need somebody to catch me

It's like I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)
I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)
It's like I'm falling form the sky (sky, sky)
And I need somebody to catch me
Catch me, when I come down (down, down, down)
When I come down (down, down, down)
When I come down (down, down, down)
Will you catch me?
When I come down (down, down, down)
When I come down

Girl I'm running out of time, come back around
Only a few seconds before I hit the ground
How do you expect me to fly when you are my wings?
Oh I can't breathe, no
Baby it's like I'm dreaming, got nothing to hold on to
I can't wake up girl, laying next to you
I can't think, I can't sleep, I can't eat

[2x]
It's like I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)
I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)
It's like I'm falling form the sky (sky, sky)
And I need somebody to catch me
Catch me, when I come down (down, down, down)
When I come down (down, down, down)
When I come down (down, down, down)
Will you catch me?
When I come down (down, down, down)
When I come down

[Spoken]
I did this in the memory of a couple of my homies
Couple of your homies
Um, not acknowledging or glorifying any type of violence or any type of thing like that
Peace

[Hook]
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze (Yeah! Ugh-ugh, ugh-ugh, yeah)
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze (South side, west side—yeah, yeah, y-yeah, yeah)
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze (North side, ugh, Madison Street, yeah, yeah, y-yeah, yeah, east side)
On a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze (Westside, haha, yeah!)
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze (This one goes out)
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze (To the mothers, mothers)
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze (Who lost sons who was just tryna gain family)
On a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze (R.I.P. Ram, Kato, Frank Nitty, ugh, yeah)

[Verse 1]
I tips my to the left, it's just the Westside of him
Don't ride nothing, but know plenty people—peoples that ride something
Decided, cousin, I should describe the lives of 'em
Some wives drive Chevys with gold Daytons and the tires of 'em (Mm)
But first, let me tell you where son grown
Grew up 'round GDs, CVLs, Black Souls, and Unknowns
Hangin' hat, bangin' sacks, slangin' with guns on
Forced to drop the forks or you gotta run home
Or you gotta run anyway after you drop the folks
Because they was really folks looking for somebody to jump on
Wars, Lords shoot up all the corners they hung on
Hear the squeezin', ring for my region brother to come home
Violations, laws, lessons, sessions, and mandates
Picnic collections lit, sign throwing and handshakes
That's where I stayed, drive-bys where I played
GDN in they fades, with a one-fifty sittin' sideways

[Hook]
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze (Yessir, yessir)
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze (Ha)
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze (Yessir, yessir)
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze (Lupe)
On a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze (Yeah, yeah, ugh)

[Verse 2]
I seen 'em brawl for it, write on the wall for it
Get kicked out the mall for it, run from the law for it
See things they should've never saw for it
'Long as it's all well, almighty, all-righty, they all for it, ugh (Woo)
Blackhawk fitted, get hit in the jaw for it
Blue-and-black Jordan-sportin', might get you applause for it
Peace treaty for, like, a week if chief and them called for it
A hundred and fifty deep in your street, saying, "Y'all broke it"
But what started that was a shawty walking down the ave' in a starter cap
Pops said he ain't want me having no part of that—those happenings with the hats and things
Moved me out south— now, all my homies is Latin Kings
Teaching me Spanish, Lowrider Magazines
Black-and-gold bandannas, taggin' crowns up on the scene (Woo)
That was the age, kinda how Lupe was made
Homies from Paxtown to Terror, New Era sittin' sideways

[Hook]
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze (Woo)
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze (Yessir, yessir)
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze (Ha, how Chi-Town is that?)
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze (Yessir, yessir, Lupe)
On a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze (C'mon, ugh)

[Verse 3]
See, from youth, I wasn't a stranger
Pops schooled 'em to the El Rukn's, plus the P. Stone Rangers
And as I grew up, knew most of what happened threw up
Disciples loved the Geto Boys because they was talkin' to Hoover
Time versus life—it's all a process
Drive-bys, gang fights, and lockowns had us scared of the Projects
Couple Arab Knights and solid Fours I knew thought that them Moes was cool—they said, "Salaam-alaikum," too
Told my out-of-town friends to take off they hat
That they couldn't wear that in the places I was taking them to (True)
My homies was breakin' it, so I was breakin' it, too (True)
If they started chasin' them, then they was chasin' me, too (True, woo)
Probably all got cousins, brothers, sisters, and loved ones
That probably died for nothin' on shakin' up or somethin'
To the mothers that paid, to my homies in the grave
Keep a glittered one-fifty in your memory, homie, sittin' sideways

[Hook]
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze (Yessir, yessir)
On a Sunday night I might bang me some Maze

[Lupe talking]
Grew up in Chicago, West side, gang lifestyle, the drug scene, the whole.. it's like one whole universe of insanity

[Verse 1]
Before I start, like to make sure I’m smart
Gather my composure, rather my swagger and my culture
Pivot my fitted, then begin to rivet, with a change of lyric
In other words, I reposition how I sit it
Then make you feel it like I mispronounced "filet"
On second thought, I can't make you fill it
Like you digging your own grave, unless you can Kill Bill it
A night of the living passed away
Can you dig it? Why Emcee? Hey
I do it for my village
The pennin' is John Lennon, the beat is the Beatles
Go together like Lenin and the people
In some fresh linens and some John Lennon’s fresh outta Seagle's
The pen and the needles...

[Writing and mumbling upcoming verse]

[Verse 2]
I'm back at cha, and I Pac like cap backwards
Like a hat's backwards, you know, when the bats backwards
Yeah, like a bat catchers
The law gotta long arm like a back scratcher
But before I leave mine at home
Like a bad catcher, I think about my zone
Where pimps make scratch off the track like a DJ
Easy, that’s my zone rappers
It's my deck
And if I catch u set trippin’ wit my cassette sittin’ in a zone rappers:
It's not a threat
Cuz it'll span ya where I roam rappers, where I hone my skills
They wanna send me back home the devil, is on my heels
The writing is Sting, liken the sequences, the Police, I repeat
We go together like the Beauty and the Beast
Writing is in my veins;
The ink is the diesel, the pen and the needles…

[Writing and mumbling upcoming verse]

[Verse 3]
The word is mightier than the sword
And my serve is tightier than yours
Like year in St. Louis ya whole flow
I fear I sank through it...
It all became clear
Like a paramedic with an electric chest kit, YEAH
The gravity of the vocabulary is a caliber equal to Excalibur
Swung wit the grace of Agassi in his amateurs, THERE
There was a deeper depth, don't know how I got here
I also had a hole in my flow
It appears I sank to it...
My swing, it couldn’t be seen
I apply some paint to it, the invisible man
Wrapped in bandages, in critical, CLEAR
The scriptin' of Scorsese the score is Count Basie
We go together like, the original and the sequel
This is the end of the trilogy, ya feelin’ me?
The pen and the needles...

[Intro]
Uh, before we get started in this
You know this thing right here
I gotta say
Welcome home
To my main man Chilly Mac

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Before we get started in here
I'd like to tell the world that my partner is here
Been on 23 and 1 for like 14 months (damn!)
That's the boss of first and fifteen is home chumps
Thanks to god for removing the obstacle
Thanks to Craig for making it possible
Million-dollar bond is what held us down
Now who in the hell is gonna help them now
You see CK cuz that check you cut
You got a couple fools on your set, what up
See his mind is sharp and mine is art
Refined and smart and it's time to start
While you was behind them bars I was behind these bars
Rewind to when the police took our cars
But they don't know there's more where that came from
Me and Chilly Mac back to backin' some

[Hook]
See the game ain't the same since you left out
See the snakes and the lames yeah they crept out
Ooh you know we need ya
Ooh I'm glad they freed ya
Here is where we need ya
Hey it's nice to see ya
Welcome back welcome back welcome back Chilly Mac
Welcome back welcome back Chilly Mac
Welcome back welcome back welcome back Chilly
Welcome back welcome back welcome back

[Verse 2]
You ain't even gonna dwell in the past tense
I gotta say one love
To that boy Shawn Carter for holdin the young nigga down
While you was absent
Make sure my foot was good and my hand was pimp
And when them niggas jumped ship
A hand was limp
To try and turn the tide help withstand the stint
The time when it was hectic strictly on the strength
That's why we got moves to make
New records to record, new rules to break
We back standing on two the crew is straight
New and improved FNF crew you snakes
How they gon' stop us police still watch us but it's cool cuz you're home dog
No more visits on Friday, no more commissary, no more collect phone calls

[Hook]
See the game ain't the same since you left out
See the snakes and the lames yeah they crept out
Ooh you know we need ya
Ooh I'm glad they freed ya
Here is where we need ya
Hey it's nice to see ya
Welcome back welcome back welcome back Chilly Mac
Welcome back welcome back Chilly Mac
Welcome back welcome back Chilly Mac
Welcome back welcome back welcome back

I'd like to welcome everybody out
To Fahrenheit 1/15
First off
RIP to my nigga Kato
What up Val
Magic what up
My man K'naan
You know
The whole henchman crew holding us down
My man Jigga
The whole Chi-Town Mike Love what up
And now
Y'all about to see something
That y'all ain't never seen before
Well
I don't wanna say never seen
But not like this you know what I'm sayin'?
FNF up!

[Verse 1]
You cut me down a tree
And brought it back to me
And that's what made me see
Where I was going wrong
You put me on a shelf
And kept me for yourself
I can only blame myself
You can only blame me

[Chorus]
And I could write a song
A hundred miles long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me
And I could write it down
Or spread it all around
Get lost, and then get found
Or swallowed in the sea

[Verse 2]
You put me on a line
And hung me out to dry
And darling, that's when I
Decided to go see
You cut me down to size
And opened up my eyes
Made me realize
What I could not see

[Chorus]
And I could write a book
The one they'll say that shook
The world, and then it took
It took it back from me
And I could write it down
Or spread it all around
Get lost, and then get found
And you'll come back to me
Not swallowed in the sea

[Refrain]
(Ooh, ah)
(Ooh, ah)

[Chorus]
And I could write a song
A hundred miles long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me
The streets you're walking on
A thousand houses long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, what good is it to live
With nothing left to give?
Forget, but not forgive
Not loving all you see
All the streets you're walking on
A thousand houses long
Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea

[Outro]
You belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea
Yeah, you belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea

[Verse 1]
You see the world in black and white
No color or light
You think you'll never get it right
But you're wrong, you might
The sky could fall, could fall on me
The parting of the seas
But you mean more, mean more to me
Than any color I can see

[Chorus]
All you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or up as us
As us

[Verse 2]
You see the world in black and white
Not painted right
You see no meaning to your life
You should try
You should try

[Chorus]
All you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or up as us

[Bridge]
And don't you wanna see it come soon
Floating in a big white balloon
Or given on your own silver spoon
Don't you wanna see it come down
There for throwing your arms around
And say "you're not a moment too soon"

[Outro]
Cause I feel low
Cause I feel low
Oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah I feel low
Oh no, oh
Oh cause I feel low
Cause I feel Low
Oh oh oh oh oh
But I feel low
Oh no, oh
Now don't start a fessin', you'll all have a chance
We're so damn hard, we never slip
Gonna rock, gonna roll, we'll take control
But if ya' had to rock the mic, it's in the soul
In the heart, in the mind, it'll make you blind
It'll make the other rappers a drop a dime
Do you mind, huh, it can take you home
And teach you not to fess on the microphone

[MCA]
M-A-Z-I-N-G
I'm a messing on the mic at all the cool parties
I've been on the mic in Rome and Capri
And all the fine Italian women fell in love with me
Now Mike D's stroll, stealin' the show
I say, come on Mike D, let's flash some dough
On the go all of the time
When you're rappin' your rhyme, you know you ring my chime
And now he's the one who's gonna show you how to dance
The King Adrock don't give him a chance
When he starts to dance, the ladies gather around
The King Adrock, he's gonna get down
He'll bust the know how to do it to you
Just four fresh folks and we form a fresh crew
Adrock just make that move
Just rock to the rhythm of the Beastie groove
I say K-I-N-G A-D rock
You know the whole world is on my jock
I got girls after me on the T-I-P
And I will do it to you, and you know it's you I please
Cause I'm a man who needs no introduction
Got a big tool of reproduction
Bouncin' in your ears what you always wishin'
For the day to come when I start to dishin'
On your body and your mind
Just take a number, and get in line
Cause when I get you into bed, you know I'll soothe you
Then you'll know the real meaning of the Beastie groove
And now something new, a double-time cool rhyme
From my boy Adrock sendin' tickles up your spine
Suck on this, cause he rocks gritty
A B-E-A-S-T-I-E, well, everyone knows me
You know that I can surely be the number one in frequency
I'm hip, I'm hoppin', I tick and tock
For everyone that's on my jock
You know that I can surely rock
I like to talk, I take the time
Turn it in, I turn it out
Makin' rhymes, scream and shout
King of the mic, I rock
I know how to turn you on just like a light
I'm number one, and I'm the one
King Adrock of psycho to the last
Is the day of the Beastie groove
So bet the fly rhymes to make you move
Everybody in the world, whoever you are
You better get ready, DJ Double R, huh
That's right
Hey, hey, mama

[Mike D]
Just make that move
Just rock to the rhythm of the Beastie groove
Well, I'll put it to you, I'm Mike D
I'm rappin' on the mic, a number one MC
Cause when I'm on the court, I put the ball in the hoop
I'll throw you ten bucks as I do the alley-oop
Just throw me the ball, and watch me get down
I'll take you for a sucker, and I'll throw you to the ground
Take that, if you think you can
Meet the floor and that to this here rap
Now you know you can bust that move
Everybody dance to the Beastie groove

[MCA]
Just make that move
Just rock to the rhythm of the Beastie groove
Come on gorgeous, pretty, little, French fly girlie
See me standin' on the stage and wanna' tour around the world
If you wanna' see some more
When I'm not on the floor
Just come on back stage, and I'll tell you how to turn it
If you don't know what to do, I'll do it to you
Well, just take off your clothes and start the boogaloo
Now all the nice ladies
We'll all say please
"Please"
And they all know that's me
MCA makin' the party
With the ultimate rhymes from tip to bass
Just doin' those ladies all over the place
On the floor or in the back
I never do it wack
Just put 'em in a line, layin' on their back
And then I'll do them all, one at a time
MCA so loose with the rhyme
Ohh
The BEASTIE GROOVE
Oh, fuck you...
Wh-wh-what? What am I supposed to say?

[Intro : Ab-Soul]
Yeah, see, I know I can make a lot of money doing this, man
It's just the whole process that uh...
That I'm having trouble with, you know what I mean?
I know you just, pretty much, you know
Get the water boiling, and just, uh, get a jar or something like that
Put it in the jar and just watch it you know bubble up and all that

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Shame on him! (what?)
Lemme put my gloves on
And my scrubs on
I'm the chemist that's whippin' it in the kitchen
This here is not for the children
You need parental advision
If you wanna learn how to cook in the dope business
First you bargain shop
Look for the priciest chickens
I recommend that you pay Jorge a visit
Got it wrapped in saran
17.5 no, drop four grand, this is LA man!
Unless it be a drought
But homie if it ain't, then it is somewhere else
Flip your hustle down south
That's a whole other story though
Back to the lesson, hope you're takin' down your footnotes, class is in session
Get your instruments
Grab some baking soda, a triple beam, a beaker
And a hanger you can stir it with
Split nine Os four ways in that 36
Place it on the triple beam
As hard as it may seem, it's not that tricky
Say you'll get it baby, just bear with me
Confidence before compliments
Now let's get busy
This is the procedure
250 grams of coke, 150 grams of soda
Place it in the beaker
Your water should be boiling by then
Grab a small cup and pour it in
Twist the hanger until it's paper thin
Place the hanger in the beaker then give your wrist a circular spin
But hold on it gets tricky again!
As your hand rotate
You're probably thinkin' it's safe
Until it starts to harden, slowing down the pace
The muscle inside your arm is makin' your joints ache
You're strugglin' on the job, but don't lose faith
Wait...you got it back soft (good)
Now pour some hot water inside the beaker jar
The work should rise to the top
Then pour some cold water on that
That's when the dope should drop
Snatch the cookie out the jar, grab a razor from the cabinet
Place it on the cardboard, then chop
As soon as the razor hit the work, you're happy
You're excited that the chemistry worked
This the fiend's appetite
This bigger than life
You turned to Mr. Nino Brown in one night
You should thank me twice
Though you learned from a chemist who never moved a brick in his life
How ironic...hmm
Like most of you rappers

[Outro: Ab Soul]
Aw I don't believe that man
You're too professional with it man
There's no way you've never done it before, you know what I mean?
That was too descriptive

[Intro]
Oooooh, ooooh
Ooooh, ooh ooooh
Ooh ooooh
Oooooh, ooooh, ooooh

[Chorus]
Everything that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies
Ain't none good, it's all bad
And I just wanna confess
It's been going on so long
Girl, I been doing you so wrong
And I want you to know that
Everything that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies
Ain't none good, it's all bad
And I just wanna confess
It's been going on so long
Girl, I been doing you so wrong
And I want you to know that...

[Verse 1]
Every time I was in L.A., I was with my ex-girlfriend
Every time you called, I told you, "Baby, I'm working"
(No!) I was out doing my dirt
(Oh!) Wasn't thinking 'bout you getting hurt
(I) was hand-in-hand in the Beverly Center like, man
Not giving a damn who sees me
So gone, so wrong
Acting like I didn't have you sitting at home
Thinking about me
Being the good girl that you are
I bet you probably believe you got a good man
A man that never would do the things I'm about to tell you I've done
Brace yourself, it ain't good
But it would be even worse if you heard this from somebody else

[Chorus]
Everything that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride (Wooooooaaaah)
I've been telling you so many lies
Ain't none good, it's all bad
And I just wanna confess
It's been going on so long (Yeah)
Girl, I been doing you so wrong (Yeah yeah)
And I want you to know that
Everything that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride (Ooh ooh yeah)
I've been telling you so many lies
Ain't none good, it's all bad (All bad)
And I just wanna confess (Yeah yeah)
It's been going on so long (So long)
Girl, I been doing you so wrong (So wrong)
And I want you to know that...

[Verse 2]
If I could turn back the hands of time and start all over, I would
Instead of everything being all bad, baby, everything'll be all good
I don't wanna lose you
But I know what I'm telling you ain't gon' make you wanna stay
You probably just wanna run away
I'm mad enough to punch me in my face
I've been living like an idiot and I deserve every bit of it
I know today is the day that I end all the lying and the playing and the bullshit, girl
I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry
But I can no longer walk around with this stress on my chest
I confesssssss...

[Chorus]
Everything that I've been doing is all bad (Everything)
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride (Wooooooaaaah)
I've been telling you so many lies
Ain't none good, it's all bad
And I just wanna confess
It's been going on so long (So long)
Girl, I been doing you so wrong (Too wrong)
And I want you to know that (Want you to know)
Everything that I've been doing is all bad (All bad)
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
Ain't none good, it's all bad
And I just wanna confess (Ooh ooh ooh)
It's been going on so long (So long)
Girl, I been doing you so wrong
And I want you to know that...

[Break]
Stevie, break it down
Oh oh, oh oh
Dear baby
Oh, baby
Don't leave me, baby

[Harmonica Solo]

[Chorus]
(Everything that I've)
Everything that (been doing) I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies
Ain't none good, it's all bad
And I just (it's all bad) wanna confess
It's been going on so long (Going on so long)
Girl, I been doing you so wrong (Doing you so wrong)
And I want you to know that
Everything (all bad, all bad) that I've been doing is all bad (All bad)
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride (Ah baby yeeaah)
I've been telling you so many lies (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ain't none good, it's all bad (Oh baby)
And I just wanna confess (Oh baby)
It's been going on so long
Girl, I been doing you so wrong (Oh, no baby)
And I want you to know that (So bad, so bad)
Everything that I've been doing is all bad
I got a chick on the side with the crib and a ride
I've been telling you so many lies
Ain't none good, it's all bad...

[Intro: Action Bronson]
Bronsolino.... no
Straight from the galaxy
Drug abusin'

[Sample: Harry Fraud's trademark shout-out]
La musica de Harry Fraud

[Hook: Action Bronson] x2
I got the jar full of drugs
Fridge is filled with snapple
Southern coast of France
Tart fennel with the apple
The feet are purple cause I'm stepping on the grapes
Consensual the rape
I got the presence of the greats

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
We grip grains
Switch lanes
Been fucking since the fifth grade
I never rock the ring or necklace with a bitch name
A thick frame
Flawless victory my dick game
Is Mortal Kombat, you still a shorty shit stain
My drug, blood, beauty, origami cranes
Perfection like an Asian's math
Neat like an Irish drink
You know that Bronson like a swimmer cause I dive in pink
You sooner see me out in Africa with tiger mink
We make your father curtsy
Cut off his manhood
Come through in Beamers
Interior leather tan wood
The shoes are suede
Off the reservation - redfoot
These stripper bitches in my bed
They give me head good

[Hook: Action Bronson] x2

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
This is blood sport
Kick boxer, double impact
Kick it like a Van Damme foot
You get your shit cracked
I'm out for justice
Above the law and hard to kill
G-g-guard your grill
Catch me hoppin' out the hard De Ville
Hammers are pointing my direction to the top
The loafers show off my ankle
Getting shifty in the drop
Kid, twist up the pot
Through my nostrils to the atmosphere
No middle man
You deal directly with the captain here

[Movie sample: Out For Justice (1991)]
"You still suckin' it. When your brother was around town suckin' dicks, just the same... you shouldn't talk so tough."
"My brother was here, you wouldn't talk so tough like that."
"Yeah, well he's not here. You know why he's not here?"
"Why?"
"Cause he's a chickenshit fuckin' pussy asshole!"

[Hook: Action Bronson] x2

[Hook]
Do it again and i'll see you tomorrow
I wanna get it, You've got something to borrow
Give me, Give me right of my own
Cause when I throw you on again
I buy it but it don't measure up
What is the missing ingredient

I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away
I, I see you fade
I, I see you fade away

[Verse: Big Sean]
Yea, Yea, Aye
I went from no Role Models to onto Road Models
So please do not tell me who the hell I should follow
I used to watch Puff pop gold bottles
Now they see anotha' Sean pop more bottles
Bitch I go full force, Skywalker
You, You Lukewarm.. I am your father
Sometimes you need a new deal depending on your cards
But if you talkin bout' the right cards
My hand is Hallmark
And naw I caint' tell you my secret
Cause if I did then you wouldn't need me bitch
B.I.G. known so widly. ( Wat.? )
I went and threw away my I.D

[Verse 1: M.I.A.]
Time after time, you been copping mine
Like, "Can I have a good time at yours tonight?"
'Cause every time we try to get close
There is always something that I'm thinking about

[Pre-Chorus: M.I.A.]
(You want me)
XXXO, XXXO
(You want me)
XXXO, XXXO

XXXO, XXXO

[Chorus: M.I.A.]
You want me be somebody who I'm really not
You want me be somebody who I'm really not
You want me be somebody who I'm really not
You want me be somebody who I'm really not

[Verse 2: M.I.A.]
A knock at the door, and then we hit the floor
And all I know is you leave me wanting more

You want me be somebody who I'm really not
You want me be somebody who I'm really not

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
XXXO
Y'all just so metrosexual
This is not my politically correct flow
This is more like letting that TEC blow
This is more like a left when they say right
When the world do you wrong but you play right
This is more like pushing that white rock
When the world try to put you in a tight box
Coming down in the drop with the system crank
'Cause you don't give a fuck what the system think
Y'all comin up M.I.—M.I.—M.I.A
Semi-spray when you in my way
I'mma be who I'm gonna be
I'm just a boy from the hood
What you want from me?
Ugh

[Outro: M.I.A.]
You want me be
You want me
You want me be
You want me

[Chorus]
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been wasting most of their time
Glorifying days long gone behind
They've been wasting most their days
In remembrance of ignorance oldest praise

[Bridge]
Tell me who of them will come to be?
How many of them are you and me?

[Verse 1]
Dissipation, race relations
Consolation, segregation
Dispensation, isolation
Exploitation, mutilation
Mutation, miscreation
Confirmation to the evils of the world

[Chorus]
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
They've been looking in their minds
For the day that sorrow's lost from time
They keep telling of the day
When the savior of love will come to stay

[Bridge]
Tell me who of them will come to be?
How many of them are you and me?

[Verse 2]
Proclamation of race relations
Consolation is integration
Verification of revelation
Acclamation, world salvation
Vibration, simulation
Confirmation to the peace of the world

[Chorus]
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
We've been spending too much of our lives
Living in a pastime paradise
Let's start living our lives
Living for the future paradise
Praise to our lives
Living for the future paradise
Shame to anyone's life
Living in a pastime paradise

[Verse 1]
Oh, girl I've known you very well
I've seen you growing everyday
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die
Oh say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever, just a minute at a time

[Chorus]
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me

[Verse 2]
There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself
Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking about those people then
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love I know I would die
Oh say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever, just a minute at a time

[Chorus]
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me

[Outro]
Hey
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me

[Verse 1]
Listen to the ground
There is movement all around
There is something goin' down
And I can feel it

[Verse 1]
On the waves of the air
There is dancin' out there
If it's somethin' we can share
We can steal it

[Pre-Chorus]
And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me
Yeah, and the feelin' is right

[Chorus]
Then I get night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

[Verse 3]
Here I am
Prayin' for this moment to last
Livin' on the music so fine
Borne on the wind
Makin' it mine

[Chorus - Var. 1]
Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

[Verse 2]
In the heat of our love
Don't need no help for us to make it
Gimme just enough to take us to the mornin'
I got fire in my mind
I got higher in my walkin'
And I'm glowin' in the dark
I give you warnin'

[Pre-Chorus]
And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me
Yeah, and the feelin' is right

[Chorus]
Then I get night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

[Verse 3]
Here I am
Prayin' for this moment to last
Livin' on the music so fine
Borne on the wind
Makin' it mine

[Chorus]
Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

[Chorus]
Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

[Outro]
Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it

[Verse 1]
Don't know why
I'm surviving every lonely day
When there's got to be
No chance for me
My life would end
And it just don't matter how I cry
My tears of love
Are a waste of time
If I turn away
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do

[Hook]
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
Can't let go
And it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily
To you my love
To dreams that never will come true
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do

[Hook]
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, oh oh oh oh

They ran up on my bus cuz' police said they smell me
So me and L O L A, blow and smoke in LA
Flossin', Straight bossin', Take strains, we cross em'
My chains hang, they cost em', They hatin', we awesome
Throw back on drinkin' lately I've been thinkin'
I've been partyin' too much and livin' like the weekend
And then I think bout what my life could be
That's when I pour another drink and light this weed
You really sure you want to grow up to be just like me?

[Hook]
They say I'm livin' it
I'm all about, you all about it, they all about it, we all about it
Them, them haters, them ha-haters they sick of this
I'm all about, you all about it, they all about it, we all about it
That, That paper, That pa-paper I'm gettin' it
I'm all about, you all about it, they all about it, we all about it
Them, them haters, them ha-haters they sick of this
I'm all about, you all about it, they all about it, we all about it

Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

[Verse 1]
Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

[Refrain]
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

[Bridge]
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang

[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

[Refrain]
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

[Interlude: Sherane]
(Pool full of Kendrick's lies in it)
Aw man… where is she takin' me?
Where is she takin' me?
(Pool full of liquor, I'ma die in it)

[Verse 3]
All I, All I, All I, All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

[Outro]
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-Dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ****'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody

[Car door opens and gunshots are fired]
Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?
L****, you good?
Yeah, blood, I'm good – Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say somethin' – Dave?
These bitch-ass niggas killed my brother!

Girl, give me your best, expect none less, girl

[Verse 2: Usher]
Said you wouldn't, but you did it, oh girl
I can tell you don't regret it 'cause you ain't been touched like this
Since the last time
The feeling that I get every time we connect, oh, there it is
One more kiss and I'm out, but I'll be back around
Baby, you can hang around if you want to
But I gotta be out, handle some B.I
When I get back, get ready for the second round

[Chorus: Usher]
Girl, I'm in your town, come over
Girl, don't let me down, I won't be here for long

You know this whole album and all that that you've been working on my dude
It's like, it's like a long time coming man for people to get a chance to
Look into the mind of a villain, you know like somebody who really has
A serious outlook on their craft, you know there's a lot of clowns out here
With you know, painted faces and when they take the paint off
It's just a clown with no paint on their face 

[DOOM laughing]
So please understand my dude I'm watching you man and I see what you doing
It's the OG man Bumpy Knuckles straight fly, aight?
My motto for 2009 is fuck everybody

So when you go on stage and you put your middle finger up to the crowd
Ask them to put it back up
And when they show respect to the villain they should say fuck everybody 

[DOOM laughing]
Cause that's what everybody's gonna say when they have to show respect for you
Ahh fuck him, fuck him that's the dinkest shit in the world if they write this

Themselves
Aight, stay focused my dude I appreciate your work

Hello. This is the Exec Banker 6050 Money Counter
It can tell you the value of the bills counted as well as the piece count
All you have to do is tell it what denomination you’re counting and it gives you both value and piece count
Ok, I’m gonna turn the machine on by pressing the button in the rear
By the way, this machine can be 220 volts or 110, so if you need it with European power please let us know
As you can see after it comes on a nice big video screen lights up…

[Hook]
Jacuzzi on the roof
Ugly hoes don't get the time of day
Chiefing on sativa
Smell the reefer from a mile away
Pistol in my coupe
Try my troops
You'll get blown away
Gucci Mane got long money
Bitch that's all I got to say
Gucci mane got long money
That's what them bitches say
Gucci mane got long money
That's what them bitches say
Gucci mane got long money
That's what them bitches say
I ain't even gotta talk
My money conversate

[Verse 1]
We been stunting
Got a money tree
I drown the bitch with money
Ferrari with
Them bumble-bee
Forgiato sitting up under it
("How many carats in that bracelet baby?")
I think about 200
Plus I hit the club with 50k
Let's keep this shit 100
Got a couple houses
Several spouses
In my penthouse
Smoking ounces
Came up selling ki's and ounces
Half a pound
White, Gold, and Brown
My pants sag
Grands weigh em down
These kats are trying to go downtown
Just to walk around and window shop
I shut them all down everytime
Everytime that I hit the scene
Fresher than I wanna be
Cover of the magazine
Back of the limousine
Stacks in my denim jeans
Hoes gone remember me
458 ship to me from Italy
612 sitting outside the facilities
911 Gucci ice game killing me
Came a long way from drug dealing
Waking up rich is a great feeling
Couple million stashed for my grandchildren
Just hand counted me a coupe half million
Up on 'em
Pull up on 'em
Like a bird drop low
And shit on 'em
Piss on 'em
Spit on 'em
Tell them haters Gucci got rich on 'em
It's GUCCI!!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Every city
I make magic
I make money disappear
Cause it’s a tragedy
How clear these diamonds
Blinging in my ear
So many wanna marry me
I'm married to the game
Cocaine put me in position
Swagger brought me all the fame
I need accountants to help me count it
Rolls-Royce I mount it
Corvette painted candy
Drop the top
And bitches crowd it
Houses in Zone 6
All my niggas hustlers
And robbers
Don't fuck with us
You'd be better off
Fucking off with Angel Dust
I'm racked up
Like a pool table
Stay draped up
And Purple Label
Drank purple drank
Smoke purple weed
Got a purple car
And long paper
Every day thank the Lord that I wake
Every day living like my last day
Shine so bright rock stupid ice
More carats in my chain than a carrot cake
Money short
He running out
I'm bussin' out
Can't close the vault
Ain't my fault
It's yo fault
Nobody stays here
This my money's house
Stash house
Stocked up
Try to fuck shit
Get chopped up
I'm rocked up
Stay blocked up
I ain't locked up
But I'm guaped up
It's GUCCI!!!

[Outro]
All you have to do, it’s ready to go, is drop your bills in flat like you would on a tabletop
Very easy to use. It counts through and it says “25.”
Now if I take these bills and put them in again, it starts over at zero again and says “25” again
However, if I push the add button, now, if I drop them in it’s going to start where it left off and continue
Now, it says “50.” Drop them in again, it’s going to say “75…”

[Intro: Kanye West]
I'm, I-I-I'm sky high
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Flashing lights
I go for mine, I got to shine
I'm sky high
Throw your hands up hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
Everybody
Like we always do it this time
I go for mine, I got to shine
Throw your motherfuckin' hands
Get 'em high
Feels good to be home baby, feels good to be home

[Verse: Kid Cudi]
Nigga I'm G-double-O-D Good
Back up in the blogs like a poppin' nigga should be
Never ever was a shoulda coulda woulda type
I am controlling what the people say they like
And no not the label, this is dream on
Play my songs so you can witness what I'm on
Besides 808's, okay now wait
When you hear my album it won't be hard to get a date
Yes M-dub it, I'm kickdrum strummin', hummin'
The product of a suburb is stonecold thorough
Very well-rounded, most people don't know though
Hey is that Diddy in that photo? (Hell yeah)
Back home they don't know what I have went through
To get to you, y'all, everybody
G.O.O.D. Music up in the party
Paparazzi need not bother nobody

[Outro: Kanye West]
Can I talk my shit again?

I met you through your best friend
I was on the road
And you said I sang all your favorite songs
My room was at the Westin
The drive was even close
Be there soon as you drop Latisha off
I'll be waiting on the next plane
I'll be waitin' on you, Let's plan
This one night special for you
I'mma make it worth it baby
I'll do something extra for you

[Verse 2]
And you ain't gotta do it back
That's a gift, a present
You made this trip excellent
Best it could have ever went
Wrestling, lettin' all your worries go
Feel like you'll never stress again
Hopefully one day there can be an us again
Us again, us again
But if not, fuck it then
Nah I'm playin', you my dying wish bucket list
Thinkin' 'bout you any time I'm with my other bitch
This OT fling, my out of town girl
We don't need roads, we in our own world
I know they gonna feel me on this one
Yeah, bitch
Come fly with the planes
Captain of the spaceship
Taylor Gang, champagne, Lamborghini wangs

[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
My friends roll Lexus and Benzes
Spend ends tremendous, uh, like dough's endless
Been this nigga from the start, was already hot
No prob' openin' shop, the flow ready rock (Yeah)
So many try and knock my hustle
Half of y'all ain't even got no hustle, I'm into living good
So I bring heat with the flow just how a nigga should
Come between me and my dough, I wish a nigga would (Nigga would)
Roll O's and cigarillos, my black brim low
The way I stack in dough attract nymphos (Damn)
Cats sick though, too impressed by how that honey walk
Me, I'm tryna come up on some ways to make that money talk (Money talk)
Sink or swim, I'm a hungry shark (Shark)
And I want it all, cribs and a foreign car, Audemars (Mar)
I could be gone tomorrow (Morrow)
That's why I grind like it's my last day
Hundred fucking roaches in my ash tray

[Chorus]
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good

[Verse 2]
My weed kicks like Jet Li flicks
Test me kid, slap shots like Gretzky hits (Woo)
The best kept secret, yes he is
The cat's out of the bag, I puff puff and I pass
You dumb fucks and I laugh, motherfucker, what you hatin' for?
Why you just standin' outside, what you waitin' for? (Haha)
I'm blowin' on an eighth or more, touring for my paper, boy
Before I hit the club I need a blunt or two or three or four (Yeah)
Bad bitches thirsty for stars with mad riches
Wanna ride with 'em, rest they heads on televisions
I don't bag bitches (Nah) they hop in, you just follow and
You beg bitches, (Damn) you're not a pimp, I was schooled by the
Best of them, (Yeah) now they cuttin' checks for him
Ain't gettin money then it's probably for the rest of them
Something like a legend when I quote what I wrote (Wrote)
Be in the big cloud from the blunts that I smoke (Smoke)

[Chorus]
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good

[Verse 1]
Let me set it straight, cake like a heavy weight
Still got a squad of crews moving that heavy weight
I'm past most of you lames, brake fast off in the lane
You just ashamed cause you playin' and I'm coaching the game
Hat cocked to the side, wide birds flock to the guys
Ride that Glock to ya side, flyin' that hospital ride
I'm bout my money dummy, so we can take it there
All you need is 4, 5 niggas so we can make it fair
Can't compare, I'mma go hard till a nigga drop
Bigga chain, hundred cars, Starbursts is in the watch
I, with these bars and lines, I dun' scarred some minds
Great plus the baby face got the whores in line
But the difference is wit yours and mine
I'm with a group of tens, friend, it's the march of dimes, yeah
Cause I'm the lady lover, crazy since the 80's fucka
Nasty flow, scrappy no, hate or love us, baby brother
If rap was movin' packs, I'm servin' pounds now
Yeah, you hot in ya hood, I'm burnin' towns down
My main purpose to surface and switch the style round
The game's turned to a circus, too many clowns now
So move with the pump, grab your tools, split your blunts
Cruise with the crews that'll bruise if they hit you up
See I'm the cake'o'holic tryna' make this paper brolic
Trip or scrap, listen this a wrap, man it's safe to call it

[Hook]
My weight's up how I handle these beats
So wake up, I'm the man in these streets
Cause Wiz Khalifa got that
Fast to that slow flow, cash gettin' mojo
Say ya rap, niggas play it back they like "Oh no!"
My weight's up how I handle these beats
So wake up, I'm the man in these streets
Cause Wiz Khalifa got that
Fast to that slow flow, cash gettin' mojo
Say ya rap, niggas play it back they like "Oh no!"

[Verse 2]
Oh no keep an eye out for the po-po
Bigger raps make my figures stack like a totem pole
Bigger stacks so to bigger gats on the road, yo
Spittin crack, sick of niggas act like you don't know
Sittin' back, twistin' somethin' fat, it's that hydro
I know, it's a wrap, creepin' through the side door
Wiz Khalifa murk the game, youngin' but my mind grown
It's a keeper worth some change, youngin' leave ya mind blown
And when the winter get cool, I switch the time zones
You's a beginner, you fool, the dumbest I've know
You steady frontin' and rhymin', say you puttin' ya time in
Claimin' that you in diamonds but they rhinestones
See I'll crack a man, I don't wanna clap a man
So I put the cheese on ya head like a Packer fan
A hundred niggas in all black gon' pack a van
Hop out and get the shit to clappin' like in Pakistan
See I'll pack a stand, say you deep but know you not
Bubble music blowin' pop, pause, I'm as hard as rock
All you other artists stop braggin' on the DVD
Fag is what you seem to be and tragic what it means to me
Laughin' when I see you be, askin' if you think it's me
Relaxin' with my faction and we stackin' cheese repeatedly
And chicks dig the kid, cook, clean, and ride for me
Birds flock cuz I'm hot, stop you see a flying V

[Hook]
My weight's up how I handle these beats
So wake up, I'm the man in these streets
Cause Wiz Khalifa got that
Fast to that slow flow, cash gettin' mojo
Say ya rap, niggas play it back they like "Oh no!"
My weight's up how I handle these beats
So wake up, I'm the man in these streets
Cause Wiz Khalifa got that
Fast to that slow flow, cash gettin' mojo
Say ya rap, niggas play it back they like "Oh no!"

[Verse 3: Beyoncé & Sean Paul]
Picture us dancin' real close
In a dark, dark corner of a basement party (Oh, na, na, na)
Every time I close my eyes
It's like everyone left, but you and me (Oh, na, na, na)
In our own little world, the music is the sun
The dancefloor becomes the sea (A wi done, girl)
Feels like true paradise to me, yeah (Introverted, oh, na, na, na)

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Sean Paul]
Baby boy, you stay on my mind
Fulfill my fantasies (Come on, girl, tell me how you feel)
I think about you all the time

Baby boy, not a day goes by
Without my fantasies (By, by, by, by, come on, girl, tell me what's the deal)
I think about you all the time (Oh)
I see you in my dreams (See you in my dreams; yuh done know di love is real)

[Bridge: Beyoncé, Sean Paul, Both]
Baby boy, you stay on my mind (Yo, yo, B)
Baby boy, you are so damn fine (Yeah, yeah, girl)
Baby boy, won't you be mine? (Yo, yo, B)
Baby boy, let's conceive an angel

Baby boy, you are so damn fine (Yeah, yeah, girl, oh)
Baby boy, won't you be mine? (Yo, yo, B, oh)
Baby boy, let's conceive an angel

I say get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up

Wait a minute

Whoo-ha!

Get down
Just like this

Yo, get off the pipe, pussy!

Is your name Michael Diamond?
Wohoohaa...yeah
G-g-g-get down
Lyrics identical to "Stop That Train"


Stop that train, I wanna get off

Welp, it's 4am, I've got the Hasenpfeffer Ale
I've got nothing to lose, so I'm pissing on the third rail
Groggy-eyed and fried, and I'm headed for the station
D-train ride to Coney Island vacation
Dedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1-train
They be kicking out windows, high on cocaine
And then I jump the turnstile, 'cause I can't afford a token
Riding between the cars, pissing, smoking
Head for the last car, fluorescent light blackout
Policeman told my homeboy, "Put that crack out"
You know you light up when the lights go down
And then you read the New York Post, Fulton Street, downtown
Same faces every day, but you don't know their names
Party people going places on the D train

Stop that train, I wanna get off
Stop that train, I wanna get off
Trench coat, wingtip, going to work
And you'll be pullin a train like you're Captain Kirk
Pickpocket gangsters, payin' their debts
I caught a bullet in the lung from Bernhard Goetz
Overworked and underpaid, starin' at the floor
Prostitutes' spandex caught in the slide doors
Now stuck between the stations, it seems like an eternity
Sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity
$50.00 fine I'm disturbing the peace
The neck, tortoise, the Lees are creased
Hot cup of coffee and the donuts are Dunkin
Friday night and Jamaica Queens funkin'
Elevated platform, I'm never gonna conform
Riding over the diner where I always get my toast warm
Bust into the conductor's booth and bustin' out rhymes
Over the loudspeaker about hard times
Sat across from a man readin' El Diario
Riding the train down from the El Barrio
Went from the station, straight to Orange Julius
I bought a hot dog - from WHO? George Drakoulias
Call the people, are you ready now?
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego

Girl, you know it's true
That's right, baby
Brothers out there with sisters, peep it
Years and years, you try to keep her a secret
Said she's your cousin that came for a visit
Your putting me on, is this true, now who is it?
Called your crib, got a clicking dial tone
You said it was the maid that hung up the phone
Caught her on the streets, so we took the risk
Guess what, we found out she was your sis
Now we're not Tom, Dick, Harry, or Roy
Let us crack the freak, because we're your boys
Tonight we're dropping by 'cause your parents left
The Beastie Boys gonna let you know

Your sister's def
Your sister's def

She's so hook, is she, how can it be?
Don't lie, she's not in your family
'Cause if you didn't know, people spread the word
Your a square sucker whipped, yes, you're a nerd
To be down, there's one thing you'll discover
Your sister must be a plash Beastie lover
So don't get sick, she was our pick
I hope her tongue is long, we like to be licked
You'll see it's not hard, it's naughty nice
You gotta pay us dues, and she's the price
Don't start to think about the world's discuss
Your sister's gotta hang, and that's a must
It's plain and simple, it ain't no thing
She's real def, let us give her a ring
So we conclude, this is your best move
Welcome, the Beastie Boys approve
Your sister's def
This week we all will meet
Right now the party season will reach its peak
Juice all around town, we're on the guest list
We'll bring three tricks, you bring your sis
Pay attention real close, we just begun
Trick number one is to grab her buns
We'll lose control, but we'll keep it clean
She better not wear a dress, wear the blue jeans
New or faded, we want 'em tight
Take the pockets off so we can grip it right
Stand in front, we wanna see what we like
If the room's too dark, you bring a flashlight
Two is do the do, for the whole crew
A dead giveaway cause we're giving her clues
She better be ready to play the wall
'Cause it's all for one, and one for all
No matter who's first, let's start the show
There are no rules, go for what you know
We won't slack up, won't let her rest
Our pride is on the line, to see who's best
Now that you've heard thoughts quite absurd
Convince your sis, put in a good word
Your sister's def

At last a neurotic feast
We're slaying your sister like a horny beast
So don't get mad, don't be upset
It's now her time to be a Beastie pet
As you can see most definitely
Is trick number three, pure fantasy
Now we're your friend, and you're her brother
But your sister's so def we might scheme on your mother
We can't ignore now that we saw
She's def so we wanna be your in-law
We're having fun, yo, we ain't done
The Beastie Boys has just begun
Because your sister's def
Your sister's def

Took a walk around the crack of dawn
I noticed her bedroom light was on
Her shadow moved over as the lights went lower
I crept to the window to see a little closer
Said to myself, "I got it made"
The window was open, so was the shade
Came in real neat, she was in heat
Your sister gave a class A peach-o treat
Her clothes got thinner, I showed her my winner
Beastie beef is now served for dinner
Your sister's def

Later on I came around the way
But sis MCA said he got some play
There had to be a reason for the news I learned
Time to get on it cause it's Mike D's turn
Nobody was home, I didn't see the car
She took me downstairs, and we crashed the bar
We was chilling in the basement, drinking Red Wipple
After a while my head between pink nipples
Grabbing at your sis cause I can't resist
I start to dive, pummel her rumble fish
When I got through, next thing she knew
On her thighs was a Beastie tattoo
Your sister's def
That's it, Adrock is pissed
If you leave me in the room with your sister, I'm taking her clit
You can bet if she gets wet
The King Adrock will make her sweat
I throw her down, then take her underwear
Then search 'em so I can eat the pubic hairs
Even in her dream scene, she starts to scream
It's the Adrock inches, and you know what I mean
We had her in the week, your sister's cheap
The Beastie Boys just made a clean sweep
Your sister's def
Wanna sing it with uncle Mike?
No
Yeah. Peanut butter and jelly
Peanut butter and jelly
*squeels*
No

*laughs*
Peanut, peanut butter and jelly
*babbles*
Peanut, peanut butter and jelly
Yeaahhh!

Hey. Hey, I wanna see my mommy
I want my mommy to come in here
*babbles*
Peanut, peanut butter and jelly
Yeah?

Peanut, peanut butter and jelly
My belly aches
Ohhh, belly aches
I'm, I’m not feeling it
With the oom pow pow
With the oom pow pow
Alright, lets go to uh, new tracks
Number eleven. That’s like (series of strange noises)
It’s the old guy
That smoosh face dude
I’m tellin you, I seen him yesterday and I seen him like three days..
I’ve seen him for years. He wears like an army coat and he’s like an older little dude like this
Oh, yeah yeah. I’ve seen him down in little Italy
He’s like (more strange sounds)
He bugs people out. That’s his shit is to bug people out (amidst more sounds)
But he’s kind of like autistic or something?
He’s a freak
He’s like (another sound)
But he looks like he might have some…
He’s struggling
(Laughing)
I only seen him with just like with the army coat on, never with any shit
Sometimes, I’ve seen him with a bird caller (more strange sounds)
And bird and weird shit, fart sounds
Yeah, like that… there’s a guy though by Astor Place too though
Anyway, though, that’s me. (more laughs followed by more sounds)
Bugs people out. He’s like totally like bugging people out, like, for real
Oh, really. Totally, Totally
Like, like…  It's like a flag at half-mast as frames click fast
Not a thing will last…

I like it. I say let’s go on to another track
OK, bad boy

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Do I have to rob Peter just to pay Paul
Just to get a blessing and to get my point across?
Play the game to win, get the money and the cars
Pussy come free when you handle business like a boss
In that GS regal, watch me swang it like a Porsche
One for sitting hard, knockin' pictures off the wall
Bitch I'm out here doggin', and I got 'em droppin' charges
Used to push the great white like I was swimmin' with the sharks
I was dead broke, tell 'em presidents they resurrected
And my dead pockets they was lifeless 'til I sold them records
I'm in the magazine posing with my nigga
Double XL, YSL on a nigga
I'm so high, I could bring hell on a nigga
Lifetime bars no bail for a nigga
Bitches keep head and that tail for a nigga
Think I sold my soul away, this ice fell on a nigga

[Bridge: Childish Gambino]
Play this in your car, give 'em sour face
Play this, play this in the club, give 'em sour face
Nigga, when they hear it, that's that sour face
Nigga lookin' at me crazy, that's that sour face

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Ring the alarm, Comme des Garçons
Lunch with a bunch of my niggas at the pond
Bowflex like a dummy, instrumental hungry
Places that I'm stayin' got more whites than all my laundry
Life of a Kennedy, James Dean roll out
Summer spent in places most my people never know about
Gettin' mama new house, for now I'm fuckin' wearin' it
Fourth of July, bitch, my shit be so American
Bless the chick I'm marryin', keep the whole estate intact
Bless the son I didn't have, sprayed 'em on her lower back
Focus on them roaches, I ain't never goin' back
Wine is so precocious, sippin' on somebody's yacht
Real money's never seen, whole thing classic
Think about in 10 years, change your whole mindset
Back when I would still sweat five Gs
Back when I was hookin' up with Ali Brie—stunt!
Yeah, it's East Side forever, bitch
Hate mail comin' from these niggas who was never rich
Or never poor, or never fly
Or seen somebody get wet up outside of Golden Glide
Hot 107, nine dreams when I run through
Man, that's Fam, Steve, Swank, that's the whole crew
Monster like a muppet, wallet Warren Buffett
Camp was last year but I ain't ever have to rough it
Lookin' fresh from the McFlys up
You don't know about 'em, better wise up
Busy with them rollers, I don't carry mine
(Busy with them rollers, I don't carry mine)
Yeah baby..
Ah yeah baby..

Shit happens with the games you run
Never thought the day would come
It Ain't Tomorrow 'Till the day is done
A-Son you caught a bad one

Yeah son - changes we go through
Catch a bad one - think the world owes you
Yeah son - what do you owe me
You catch a bad one - c'mon son show me
Yeah Son - Till the day is done
Catch a bad one - time to pay attention
Yeah Son - All That's stress can equal none
A Son - you caught a bad one

Shit happens with the games you run
Even if it's a battle you won
The new day starts when today is done
A Son - you caught a bad one
Yeah son
You catch a bad one
Yeah son - what in the fuck the world owes you
You catch a bad one - when nothing goes through
Yeah son - All about the c.r.e.a.m
You catch a bad one - things are not as they seem
Yeah Son - here your moms comes
A Son - you caught a bad one
Yeah Flo Rida
I run the globe with this one
Yeah I run the world with this one

[Intro: EZ Wider]
It's your boy Mr. EZ Wider
And there's nothing I love more
Then to come home to a nice fat, bold blunt
And if you feel the same, call up

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Shes my weed roller
And when I'm with her guarantee I'm never sober
She know exactly what I need she keep them swishers
The way she rolling up that weed I gotta keep her I gotta keep her

[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
That's good weed and she knows so she don't fuck up my swisher
She roll that thing that hit hard like a kicker
I hit the bed and then I get to twist her
Just like my swisher
And she's my weed roller
A 50 box she rolled 'em I was like damn
She lit the first one up like you know who I am
My weed roller
She's only good for three blunts then it's over

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Shes my weed roller
And when I'm with her guarantee I'm never sober
She know exactly what I need she keep them swishers
The way she rolling up that weed I gotta keep her I gotta keep her

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
She know I need that weed as soon I come home off the road
To make it easy on me she got one already rolled
A nice long swisher
And shes a good twister
Yeah I got one that will roll my weed for me
And she don't smoke so that's more weed for me
No I can't front this shawty got me impressed
Make a cigarillo look like a cigarette

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Shes my weed roller
And when I'm with her guarantee I'm never sober
She know exactly what I need she keep them swishers
The way she rolling up that weed I gotta keep her I gotta keep her

[Intro]
Watch this

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (All)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

[Verse 1]
Now, this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talking to myself, asking how I'm gon' tell you
'Bout that chick on part one I told y'all I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's three months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true?
Third thing was me wishing that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say (Oh, oh)
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (Yeah, yeah)
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do (No)
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions (This is part two)
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (Tell it all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do (I don't know, I don't know)
But to give you part two of my confessions

[Verse 2]
Sitting here, stuck on stupid, tryin' to figure out
When, what, and how I'ma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin'
Be a man and get it over with, over with
I'm riding in my whip, racin' to her place
Talking to myself, preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't wanna come near me
I said, "One second, baby, please hear me"

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (Chick on the side, oh I)
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed (So gone, so gone) and I don't know what to do
(What to do) I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (Cried, when I got it)
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do (Didn't know what to do)
But to give you part two of my confessions (But I need to tell you, baby)

[Interlude]
This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm havin' a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (All)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

[Verse 1: Chris Brown, Justin Bieber]
You've got that smile that only Heaven can make
I'll pray to God every day that you keep that smile
Yeah, you are my dream (You are my dream), there's not a thing I won't do
I'll give my life up for you 'cause you are my dream

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Justin Bieber]
And baby, everything that I have is yours
You will never go cold or hungry
I'll be there when you're insecure
Let you know that you're always lovely, girl
'Cause you are the only thing that I got right now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you
Nothing will ever come between us
'Cause I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown, Justin Bieber]
If you had my child (Yodel-lay-ah)
You would make my life complete (Yodel-lay-ah)
Just to have your eyes on little me
That'd be mine forever (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Justin Bieber, Chris Brown]
And baby, everything that I have is yours (Oh, everything)
You will never go cold or hungry (Oh)
I'll be there when you're insecure (Insecure)
Let you know that you're always lovely, girl
'Cause you are the only thing that I got right now

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Justin Bieber, Justin Bieber]
One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you (Woah)
Nothing will ever come between us
I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you

[Bridge: Chris Brown, Justin Bieber]
We're made for one another (One another), me and you (And you, and you, and you)
And I have no fear, I know we'll make it through
One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you, woah-oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Justin Bieber]
One day when the sky is falling (When the sky is falling, falling, oh)
I'll be standing right next to you (Right next to you, oh)
Right next to you (Right next to you, oh)
Nothing will ever (Nothing will ever) come between us (Come between us)
(Oh-na-na, oh-na-na, oh-na-na)
I'll be standing right next to you (Woah)
(Oh-na-na, oh-na-na, oh-na-na)
Right next to you (Right next to you)
(Oh-na-na, oh-na-na)

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown, Justin Bieber]
(Oh-na-na)
Oh yeah, stand by my side, side, side (Woah)
(Oh-na-na, oh-na-na, oh-na-na)
When the sky falls down
(Oh-na-na, oh-na-na)
I'll be there, I'll be there
(Oh-na-na, oh-na-na)

[Outro: Chris Brown, Justin Bieber, Both]
You've got that smile that only Heaven can make
I'll pray to God every day to keep you forever
Oh-oh

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, yo

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
You were that foundation
Never gonna be another one, no
I followed, so taken
So conditioned, I could never let go
Then sorrow, then sickness
Then the shock when you flip it on me
So hollow, so vicious
So afraid, I couldn't let myself see
That I could never be held
Back or up, no, I hold myself
Check the rep, yep, you know mine well
Forget the rest, let them know my Hell
There and back, yet my soul ain't sell
Kept respect up, the best they fell
Let the rest be the tale they tell
That I was there, saying

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In these promises broken, deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So, one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you go, go, go

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Test my will, test my heart
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
Y'all go hard, I go smart
How's that working out for y'all in the back, huh?
I've seen that, frustration
Been crossed and lost and told no
And I've come back, unshaken
Let down and lived and let go
So, you can let it be known
I don't hold back, I hold my own
I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned
I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone
I can't fall back, I came too far
Hold myself up and love my scars
Let the bells ring wherever they are
'Cause I was there, saying

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In these promises broken, deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So, one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you go!
(Go!)
(Go!)
(Go!)
(Go!)
(Go!)

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
No! You can tell 'em all now
I don't back up, I don't back down
I don't fold up and I don't bow
I don't roll over, don't know how
I don't care where the enemies are
Can't be stopped, all I know, go hard
Won't forget how I got this far
For every time, saying

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In these promises broken, deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So, one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you go, go, go, go
Go, go, go

[Verse 1]
Life's too short to even care at all, whoa oh-oh
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind, losing control
These fishes in the sea, they're staring at me
Whoa oh-oh, oh, whoa-oh, oh
A wet world aches for a beat of a drum, oh-whoa oh, oh

[Chorus]
If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away to some fortune that
I should have found
By now
I'm waiting for this cough syrup
To come down, come down

[Verse 2]
Life's too short to even care at all, oh-whoa, oh
I'm coming up now, coming up now
Out of the blue, oh-oh, oh-oh
These zombies in the park, they're looking for my heart
Oh-whoa, oh, whoa-oh, oh
A dark world aches for a splash of the sun
Oh-whoa oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away, to some fortune that
I should have found
By now
And so I run now to the things they said could restore me
Restore life the way it should be
I'm waiting for this cough syrup
To come down

[Bridge]
Life's too short to even care at all, oh, whoa-oh
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind, losing control

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away, to some fortune that
I should have found
By now
So I run now to the things they said could restore me
Restore life the way it should be
I'm waiting for this cough syrup
To come down

[Outro]
One more spoon of cough syrup now, oh, whoa-oh
One more spoon of cough syrup now, whoa, oh, whoa

[Hook]
You would rather be far away, just to have it go all your way
But can you afford the cost to pay
Your living in a dangerous wonderland 

[x5]

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Well welcome to the wonder
The land of make believe
That make you believe your safe
Because this is the place to be
You feel alright as long as the femine and war stay overseas
And anyone over the border
You look at them like the opposing team
Is this what it's sposed to be
Or am I just talkin emotionally
What if I expose my beliefs
That I hold real close to me
Would you call me crazy and put my face all over ya magamazines
Tell me
Do you actually think I'm as the same as I'm a have you see

[Hook]
You would rather be far away, just to have it go all your way
But can you afford the cost to pay
Your living in a dangerous wonderland 

[x5]

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
When I say the masses
Millions of kids in classes
One of them got kept backwards
For failure to do what they asked em
They will say he was stubborn and acted
Like he wasn't the son of a pastor
So he got him a pen and pad then
Started rappin and singin and clappin
Just to make the days go by faster
And one day he decided he had it
And he left and he never look back at
All the relative mathamatics
So he took the lies and detracted them
And divided them like a fraction
And he opened his eyes and realized
That he tapped into the galactic
Off he blasted

[Hook]
You would rather be far away, just to have it go all your way
But can you afford the cost to pay
Your living in a dangerous wonderland 

[x5]

[Hook]
You would rather be far away, just to have it go all your way
But can you afford the cost to pay
Your living in a dangerous wonderland 

[x5]

Wonderland 

[x16]

You would rather be far away, just to have it go all your way
But can you afford the cost to pay
Your living in a dangerous wonderland

[Verse 1]
You had all of me, you wanted more
Would you have married me if I were poor?
I guess if I was your treasury
You'd have found the time to treasure me

[Pre-Chorus]
How come you can't see
All that you need is right here with me?
Up until the end
All this pretend wasn't for free

[Chorus]
Hold me like your money
Tell me that you want me
Spend your love on me, spend your love on me
Now you have your money
Spend it 'til there's nothing
Spend your love on me, spend your love on me

[Verse 2]
If we opened up a joint account
Would it put an end to all your doubt?
Frankly, if my name was Benjamin
We wouldn't be in the mess we're in

[Pre-Chorus]
You played with my heart
"Till death do we part," that's what you said
Now you have your flash car, women and bars
It's gone 'to your head

[Chorus]
Hold me like your money
Tell me that you want me
Spend your love on me, spend your love on me
Love me like your money
Spend it 'til there's nothing
Spend your love on me, spend your love on me
Spend your love on me

[Refrain]
I want you to take me like you took your money
Take me in your arms until your last breath
I want you to hold me like you hold your money
Hold onto me 'til there's nothing left

[Breakdown]
Love spent
Feeling love spent
Yeah, I'm love spent
Wondering where the love went
Love spent
Yeah, I'm love spent
Feeling love spent
Wondering where it all went

[Refrain]
I want you to take me like you took your money
Take me in your arms until your last breath
I want you to hold me like you hold your money
Hold me in your arms until there's nothing left
Nothing left
Nothing left
Nothing left

[Breakdown]
Love spent
Feeling love spent
Yeah, I'm love spent
Wondering where the love went
Love spent
Yeah, I'm love spent
Feeling love spent
Wondering where it all went

[Refrain]
I want you to take me like you took your money
Take me in your arms until your last breath
I want you to hold me like you hold your money
Hold me in your arms until there's nothing left
(Nothing left)
(There's nothing left)
(There's nothing left)
(There's nothing left)

[Intro]
CG, Bambi
Ok, put your lightsaber hoodie up
Here we go

[Hook x2]
Why's everybody tryin' to bite my shit
Everybody tryin' to bite my shit
They tryin' to bite shit
If you don't like it, you can suck my dick, nigga

[Verse 1]
I like the ass in the way

Fuck around with niggas get clocked like a cartier
Bitch, close your mouth
Nigga, I'm so clean, but I'm from the South
Nigga, I eat cats, my name is ALF
Girls don't got drugs but they assin' out
These dudes shook like an asscrack
And when things go down like the NASDAQ
Shit, I still run it like a lab rat
These dudes beggin' like, "Baby, can I have that?"
I don't got sponsors
So check for Nicktoons because Aahhh! Real Monsters
I'm a real monster, I got a home for these creatures like Foster
That's another cartoon, mama
You know I spit silly shit like a sick llama
You know these girls crave drama
I ain't the one, I'm a drop Ralph Fiennes on you
I'm at the beach in a phantom
I'm full house cause my DJ Tanner
Shine bright, got money, Green Lantern
I pay a dude to hold my shit like pampers
Shine bright like the sun, no Sanford
And my shit go spread like cancer
At my show, yo, my girls ain't dancing
They're too busy saying, "He's so handsome"

[Hook x2]

[Verse 1]
I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

[Verse 2]
When I was just a baby my mama told me, "Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

[Verse 3]
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin'
And that's what tortures me

[Verse 4]
Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

[Verse 1]
I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on the steps with my heart in my hand
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

[Chorus]
Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

[Verse 2]
Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made

[Chorus]
So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

[Bridge 1]
Boys, you can break
You find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart

[Bridge 2]
On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the God and the weight of her world

[Chorus]
So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

[Outro]
So mothers be good to your daughters, too
So mothers be good to your daughters, too

[Verse 1: Drake]

Okay I just got back from another label meeting and
I ain't what they looking for I ain't what they looking for
I ain't really Atlanta I ain't really Brooklyn or
I dont fit the appeal for them shows that they could book him for
Straight nigga tryna get in through a crooked door
Barely fittin in cuz a gimmicks what they took him for
But getting doubted caused me to reroute it
To another destination where the people they abouuut ittt!
You ever felt high above it all?
Run your fingers through the clouds like the sky about to fall?
Treat me like I'm rich when I'm about ball
And think once about the clothing that I buy up out the Mall
I'm famous so I get approached fast, Louie and Coach bags
All up in coach class, gem like Topaz, cool like slow Jazz
Dope like coke lines and crack like broke glass
I promise this is me, me

[Hook: Drake & Slakah The Beatchild]
I'm not supposed to do this
I'm supposed to be this nigga thats rapping bout gettin money
And you herd all of my songs so you know this shit wrong
Please do me a favor and keep it between me and you

[Bridge: Slakah The Beatchild]

You, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you

[Verse 2: Drake]

Yea
Ok, I'm floating in my zone without a scheduled descend
The rising and the fall was never my intent
I want this shit forever printed in cement
And if I ever sin I promise to repent
I'm only tryin to win I ain't tryna present
You gotta listen close like it's coming through the vent
These rappers can't see me I live behind the tint
And just to get a visual them niggas gotta squint
There I ammmm
Little me in row 23F real reconize real is there none of yall left?
Everybody in the game can't none of yall ref?
And filter out the bullshit the fuck is yall def?
You'r now tuned in to the new comer of this summer
The Chris Paul of this fall exist yall - Yea
And is the realist nigga still I?!
A bitch could love you to death and you still die
Ahhh!

[Hook: Drake & Slakah The Beatchild]

I'm not supposed to do this
I'm supposed to be this nigga thats rapping bout gettin money
And you herd all of my songs so you know this shit is wrong
Please do me a favor and keep it between me and you

[Bridge: Slakah The Beatchild]

You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
Just keep it between me and you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you

[Outro: Drake]

(Crowd Clapping and Applause)
Yea
Whats goin on yall?
I wanna thank yall for coming out tonight
I go by the name of Drake
I got my man Slakah The Beatchild here
My man Hazel
You already know we about to rock tonight
So if you with me clap ya hands
I'm about to tell you a secret, as long as you can keep it
Between me and you

[Verse 1: K. Dot]
I sit on the studio couch
Ask myself, "what the fuck am I thinking about?"
Thinking 'bout living without the past and the present
A Dr. Dre record, imagine, I drift off, 600 seconds
10 minutes exact, letting my mind explore
K. Dot had turned Curious George
You know, off the hardship is what I'm curious for
Like what if Pac had never looked left to holla at broads?
Before he turned right to get them shots through the door?
They say Suge did it, but he was in emergency clinic
So he'd risk his own life to get someone else killed
But in the process, get injured, it don't make sense
It's like the Da Vinci Code, trying to solve the crime of these rap souls
What if B.I.G. never did it big?
Never went to L.A., would it make a difference in them bullet-holes?
Would it make my flow more persistent?
Would it raise up the bar of competition? Who knows
Who told Nastradamus baby momma was fucking with HOV?
Would the battle be less interesting if it wasn't personal?
If Jay wasn't intimate, there'd probably be less people listening
People thinking it's a publicity stunt
What if he partnered with Jay and still didn't blow?
Hip-hop would really be fucked
Something like Milli Vanilli
Nothing different, quite similar
Filling up my mind capacity
Thinking about Martin Luther, on the balcony
What if the shooter-
Better yet, what if Malcolm on the side?
Killed two birds with one stone, both would've died
Now let's rewind

[Chorus: D'Angelo]
Before we go, can you imagine?
Picture years with your mom
Can you imagine?
Hang her picture in the sky
Can you imagine?
Call emergency, I've been dreamin' all my life

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Imagine if Tookie was a Blood? Look, no disrespect
But would there be more Bloods than Crips sets?
Dominating the population of
L.A., Orange County, the Valley, and back up to the bay?
Matter fact, imagine if we didn't really start this gangster shit
Y'all wouldn't have nothin' to spit
No drive-bys, no flags stickin' out pockets
No N.W.A. dudes, just rappin' like Cre Cru
Imagine if Mike Concepcion walked on his own two
Feet no paralyzed, would he be alive?
Or would he been lost his life to the streets?
No match, no cars in that driveway
What if Freeway Rick never was a kingpin?
On this L.A. strip, would these rap niggas use his name?
Nah, what if rap niggas never had rap?
Would they try to fall back on this drug game?
These rappers ass backwards
Now these rappers getting caught with the cocaine
But to smoke, not to slang
Imagine that people not knowing these rap niggas insane
Just think about it

[Chorus: D'Angelo]
Before we go, can you imagine?
Picture years with your mom
Can you imagine?
Hang her picture in the sky
Can you imagine?
Call emergency, I've been dreamin' all my life

[Verse 3: Punch]
Imagine life without death, would you even feel alive?
Your people that passed, what if they never died?
Imagine seeing your mom cry, tears of happiness
Knowing her son safe, and she ain't lose him to this madness
The street living, what if the crack epidemic
Never reached the projects and destroyed our buildings?
Turned most of us to killers, innocent victims
Imagine if heroin didn't affect our system
They say drug money funding the labels today
What about the drug money that's funding the C.I.A.?
Imagine if they really tried to fix these streets
Would they start in the hood, or executive suites?
Where the real criminals meet, and principals beef with me
You could possibly live without heat
Imagine if Al Gore had won that election
Would the Twin Tower buildings still stand erected?
Imagine the penal system without witness protection
Would there be these many cowards on the stand telling?
I don't know, I'm just speaking my mind
Lost in my own soul, Just press rewind and imagine
(Training day, training day)

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Money is the reason we exist

[Verse 1: Kool A.D.]
Three stacks for a track bitch I'm yapered up
My name is Kool A.D. I'm here to say what up
You gotta understand I do it for the kids
Young brown V-Nasty let a nigga live
Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods
I'm trying to get that Oprah
Loud pack deep like Chopra
Toma! You smoking Miley Cyrus
Another episode you niggas still writing pilots
Shouts to Carlos young nigga on a roll
I think I'm Mark Ronson, peace to Amy Winehouse
I think I'm Dizzie Rascal, a whole lot of dancers
BasedGod, Young Tyler, shout out to Boy Crisis
I think I'm TrashTalk, shout out to NME
Diplo's drunkass approved my pedigree
Off that dog food Pedigree
Half these young cats couldn't stand next to me
Kool A.D. the blue eyed soul dude
Can't believe how many fucking times I told you
I think I'm Bad Brains, peace to MCA

[Verse 2: Heems]
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money
I got so much money it got me feeling funny
Give it to my parents so they don't feel crummy
Now I'm with my dad we playing cards that's Rummy
WOO-EEE! I got so many Rupees
RUUU-PEEES! As far as you'll see
I was about my money since my birth man
I was Oscar the Grouch in a church can
I'm about my money, yo', I'm Pink Floyd
And I'm from Queens yo I'm Big Noyd
I'm paranoid I think they want my top off
I'm very noid yo I'm about my guap boss
I'm smoking doobies, I'm in Dubai
Ooh I'm something of a cool guy
I'll write the verse for the money then it write itself
Started from the heart now I'm about my fucking wealth
Starving from the heart losing weight from my belt
Parking the car in the living room I need help
I think I'm Rick Ross, it's a problem
But I got that fire, bitch, I'm Dhalsim
Bitch I'm Dhalsim, bitch I'm Dhalsim
Bitch I'm Dhalsim, bitch I'm Dhalsim

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it
It's a fact kiss kiss
Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it
It's a fact kiss kiss
Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it

Tell me I'm your national anthem
Red, white, blues in the skies
Summer's in the air and baby
Heaven's in your eyes

[Intro]
Bam Bam, Bronsolino
Closed Sessions
Queens shit, Chicago

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Bitches kissing me the French way, now suck my son’s dick
He only four, when he twenty he gon’ run shit
Suede suit, waves spinning ‘cause he half black
But for now he need his blanky for his nap nap
Snapback, Knicks starter hat, ninety four
Signed by Mason, Queens domination
Green tea’s got my eyes kind of Asian
Like the bitches Dante Ross be tying in his basement

Hold the fuck up man
(yo, nah, nah, we can’t even do it like this man)
Yo we gotta give it to ‘em the right motherfucking way man
(here we go)
You didn’t come all this way for nothing right?

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
You either got it or you don’t, the ratings say I’m through the roof
Leather gloves grip the wood wheel
Have my shorty make a good meal, smoking cabbages
Rocking fabrics, sport the big beard like I’m Arabic
Uh, motherfuckers see the Halibut
And put some lemon on the side to clean my palate with
Summer radishes, chicken down at Gladys’
Down at BlackBird with hoodies and some Balances
Running and gunning, I’m Randall Cunning, my skin is stunning
Butt like an onion, she order lobster I’m hitting something
Mouth or butt, maybe pussy, smoking cookie
Girl scouts that ain’t never went the church route
Plane lands, Chicago be the destination
Five courses, gorgeous on the presentation
Roam the streets where Capone was at the throne
I write these lyrics with the music from my phone
I’m a young Mike Singletary, style shitty like a dingleberry
Push the bent like I’m Richard Dent
Steve McMichael, Paxson with the 3
You know my jacket flashing fashion pass the D

Damn man, I’m out of fucking breath
(yeah man)
You gotta give me another second because uh
(I’m a fat fuck man)
Honestly I’m a overeater and I’m not even allowed to eat
(I’m a little bit heavy and overweight)
Just give me one second
(y’all don’t even know I’m starved, I’m starved)
Alright, I-I’m in, I’m in

[Outro]
FILA cream three-quarter dipping over your Greek daughter
Pussy tasting like Kadaif, honey mixture with the sweetwater
Sweet water
Yo
Queens shit man
I love you
Goodbye

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]

Bitch I'm the truth! and I would I lie?
I walk up in this bitch like a pilot I'm fly (I'm Fly!)
Hello and bye-bye
I leave ya'll ass in the past like tie-dye (heheh)
3 blunts and a mai-tai
And I am so well connected like Wi-Fi (Haheh)
Me real dread dem dey sci-fi
And I murder Bill Nuy The science Guy

[Hook: Lil Wayne]

I! Do what I do and I do it well
I'm a OG bitch! Can't you spell?
Fuck wrong witch ya'll?
I ain't Marvin Gay, but I can get it on witch ya'll!

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]

Yea
When I rap my nigga it's so eassyy
That girl so thick she remind me of Suziee
I'm cool but heater like a jacuzi
I'm the size of a mountain so bitch you can't movve me!
Look homie you not even on my level
When it comes to battle MC's son I kill several
I get more blow than a tea kettle
Tell your girl come and suck my dick and than we settle

[Hook: Lil Wayne]

I do what I do and I do it well
I'm a OG bitch can't you spell? (Ha!)
Fuck wrong witch ya'll?
I ain't Marvin Gay, but I can get it on witch ya'll (Yea!)

Verse 3: Lil Wayne]

Microphone Ch-ecker no liquor (Ow!)
Just pain killers and prometha - young echas! (Heh)
Jumpin' the gas like checkers you can't check us
Or we all in your face like freckles - trunk speckle
Big shark talk I swim when and wheneva
I walk with a fork in my poket salt and pepper
Feed me rappers or feed me beats
And if you don't believe me than leave me be (Haha!)

[Hook 2: Lil Wayne]

I am not human I am just an illusion
Organized confusion amusing (Ha!)
I am not losing I am one of the chosen
"School Of The Hard Knocks" I am just a student

[Intro]
Uh, yeah man, uh
I feel real good right about now
I feel like im, im making a return
I ain't even been gone yet I ain't even
Taken a leave of absence but I feel like I'm back
Yeah man

[Verse]

Check, I roll with the coalition, when no one listened
I spoke out now niggas is throwing this in
You gassed up, my vehicle low emission
I can enter your field trip with no permission
Slip, i've done it before told ya I run it before
Now the city is mine, and what you thought it would be
Ain't a rapper working harder than me I put my heart in T
Uh, ?, carry the city on my back like a Jansport
Or even in a victor bag, so if you quick to brag then u get clipped to tag
Homie, u make a lot of music niggas ain't feeling
You rappers shouldn't rap, you rappers should paint ceilings
That's why I ain't competitive y'all, cuz deep down I know im much better than y'all
Watchu mean do I actually flow, wanna know if I actually flow just ask V-O
Im tryna make the wrist on my cousin ashley glow till she waken up by someone and it actually snow
Stop snitching if your man seen a killer, you never ever seen it, it can't seem familiar
We keep it on and poppin like the dance scene in Thriller
This the new version fresh prince and andreana miller
And d-10tion the boi-1da
And people focused on keeping the boy under
Probably cuz I don't act like y'all
And I ain't gotta sell crack like y'all
Well not really, I mean I do move crack in a disc form
But thats only because I don't rap like y'all
And now its occurring to them
Its starting to be my friend is reassuring to them
Either that or every verse im referring to them
So catch me in a zone till they leave me alone
Uh, yea, and its down south for the summer ima leave them at home

[Outro]
Uh, and thats just what it is
Uh, everybody that mess with me I see you
You feel me
Benard I see ya homie
Precise I see ya
Ransom, brandon I see ya
Uh, niko I see ya uh
Yea richie sosa I see ya uh
Yea JD Era I see ya
Mayhem maury er I see ya
Yea that's the coalition
D-10tion boi-1da the commitment
Heartfelt music
Andreana I see you baby
Sox yea, row
You know
Uh, we keep it goin, there's no stopping it
Its my year its my summer my decade
Yea you got an entry flow, you gotta stick around for the whole century flow nigga
That's how I do it holla at me
And thats it

[Verse 1]
I'm in the zone, they keep on getting offended
But I ain't did nothin wrong, but tighten up on my business
And now I'm making millions, everybodys' social
They really too emotional, I don't have time to hold em'
"I wanna be a billionaire," Me too
So I can count a billion cash in hundreds on Youtube
I get dirty money bitches bitches know it's ciroc on my rider
I'm on stage with Diddy, Nicki, Ricky Rozay and Flo-Rida
I rock Mauris without money, ball like Stoudemire, Amare
Hold the blunt with my left hand to show my Audemars in Paris
Look at all the I've accomplished, I just bought me 3 Ferraris
Spent 5 million in my company if offended you; not sorry

[Hook]
What it gon' be?
What it ain't gon' be, too many chains on me, too many rings on me
Baby dancing on me, diamonds dancing on me cause my watch and my ring straight dancing on freeze
What it ain't gon' be, dare anybody here to put they hands on me
Too many stacks on me, so many racks on me, got some killers with some gats and
What it gon' be?
What it ain't gon' be, dare anybody here to put they hands on me
Too many stacks on me, so many racks on me, got your dime on my line asking
What it gon' be?
(repeat x1)

[Verse 2]
I'm a mathematician young street magician, and I keep on taking pretty girls to Lenox
New Mercedes with 80 in it, watch me spend all 80 in 80 minutes
Saks & Fifth, young true religion
Bought a car so sharp it make the feds suspicious
They say I'm too flamboyant, I say they're malnutritioned
I'm in a rare edition, I think Le Mans edition
Dare anybody here to put they hands on me
Too many stacks on me, so many racks on me, got a dime on my line asking
What it gon' be? What you gon' do Gucci, when you gon' leave?
Still popping bottles pouring liquor on chicks; no need to lie I'm such a freak
No need to hide, you so unique I'mma try to beat ya back down til' you weak
Say you ran out of money then more for me, here's more for you, cause you a whore for me
Don't be a whore for free cause we could ball right now, we
Could do this 2, 3, 4 times a week
From Zone 6 down to Camilton, I pull up in that yellow thing
I put rims on, everything
Hoes think I got them wedding rings

[Hook]

[Verse 3
Like I'm in the lead, throwing money high, I don't care where it reach
Spent 2 G's a week on haircuts, like 4, 5, 6, 7 times a week
These girls petrified, almost scared to speak
I'm in a new GT with the Georgia peach
Got a condo right off the Florida beach, It ain't hard to reach, so nice to meet
Every night with me you probably fight with me
Sex fight on me and spend the night with me
No rules, everything alright with me, nice shape baby
Shaped just right for me
Catch ball players in magic city show them boys how good my jumper is
Making all pros look like amateurs
I just showed my ass last night I had a blast
My jewelry was so bright haters put theirs in the trash
Pulled up in something fast just to make them haters mad
Rims with the paper tag, paper bag full of cash

[Hook]

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love
And I don't really know what love is
I think I'm in love
'Cause I be going crazy off one kiss
I think I'm in love
She probably ain't in love with me
I think I'm in love
So I guess we'll have to see

[Verse 1]
Uh, look
There's just somethin' 'bout her caramel skin
And how that chest look in every single bra she in (Aha)
That got me with her every single day out the week (Uh-huh)
We don't even hit the streets, we just stay in the sheets (In the sheets)
Those brown eyes got me trapped
Kiss her on her stomach when she lie on her back (On her back)
She got class, cry and she laugh
A dime with a ass, drinking wine by the glass (Aha)
No other girl can make me hers
It's whoever wanna take me first
And she grabbed me, wouldn't let me go
Usually your heart like an Eskimo: cold
But she said there's something about me
That she don't want no loving without me
Skin so soft like I'm touching some downy
Girl, I think I'm in love

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love
And I don't really know what love is (Aha)
I think I'm in love
'Cause I be going crazy off one kiss (Yep, yep)
I think I'm in love
She probably ain't in love with me (Me)
I think I'm in love
So I guess we'll have to see

[Verse 2]
Look
Check my phone, always text me when she wake up
Sex is real great, always messing up her makeup (Uh)
No clothes on, lovin' to a slow song
Everybody telling us this thing we have is so wrong
And she don't care whatever goes on
Plus she's best friends with my mom (Yep)
Keep a journal, y'all know the story, though
The superficial type, love her horoscopes
And I'm a Capricorn that she ain't never had before (Nah)
Her ex hates me 'cause he ain't me, and that's for sure (Bitch)
She got this look she give that send 'em runnin'
She so stunnin', got my heart jumpin'
And my mind is all twisted
Her lips is delicious for kisses
I got her heart on my wish list
Manager: give her the business (Aha)

[Chorus]
I think I'm in love
And I don't really know what love is
I think I'm in love (Yep)
'Cause I be going crazy off one kiss
I think I'm in love (Love)
She probably ain't in love with me (Aha)
I think I'm in love
So I guess we'll have to see

[Outro]
So this bitch
Really hit me like, "How did you get so lucky?"
You know what I said? I said
"Bitch, how did you get so lucky?
The fuck you think this is"
Ayy, I treat my ladies right
And that's for damn sure

[Intro]
Dirty bass

[Verse 1: Kevnish]
Yo, I make girls jiggle, right down the middle
My girl's from Assadena, she ain't that ghetto
She likes to sip the bubb', VIP at the club
But when it comes to bass, my girl got a banging trunk

[Pre-Chorus: J-Splif]
Think the way that you roll (think the way that you roll)
Put your bass down low (put your bass down low)
You can come to the crib (you can come to the crib)
Leave your shoes at the door (shoes at the door)
You know what you’re here for (you know what you're here for)

[Verse 2: Tyga]
I’m going ham when the beat drop
Got beef, eat it like a pork chop
And the base pump pump like a beat box
I'm so hot, gonna fend them like a tea cup
He killer, bang got his chain
Big belly, chilling on the big
Well uh, your girl icky, give me licky licky
No smalls, all biggie biggie
Yum, she rap to the beat
Back, back it up, hit it beep beep
Come to L.A., life on the beach
She give me brain screech
Glove, pop it, dirty bass, girls dropping
Young Money, cash, ride it
Shake that ass, ass, ass

[Chorus]
Deep low when I feel loco
Don't trip, make it dip like a lolo
Uh, make a dip like a lolo
Then I rollo, rollo
Uh, I love that dirty bass, uh, uh
I love that, I love that, uh
I love that dirty bass, uh, uh

[Verse 3: Prohgress]
I'll bang that woofer, if she's a looker
I'm cruising Hollywood at five, I don't want no hooker
I need a five for free for the free
Let's take it back to the motel, now I'm in too deep

[Pre-Chorus: J-Splif]
Think the way that you roll (think the way that you roll)
Put your bass down low (put your bass down low)
You can come to the crib (you can come to the crib)
Leave your shoes at the door (shoes at the door)
You know what you’re here for (you know what you're here for)
You know what you’re here for (you know what you're here for)
Girl, shake that dirty bass
Real girls get down on the floor

[Bridge]
Shake it
The way you make me shake, I love that
The way you make me shake, I love that
The way you make me shake, I love that
The way you make me shake
Make me shake, make me shake
I love that

[Chorus]
Deep low when I feel loco
Don't trip, make it dip like a lolo
Uh, make a dip like a lolo
Then I rollo, rollo
Uh, I love that dirty bass, uh, uh
I love that, I love that, uh
I love that dirty bass, uh, uh
I love that, I love that

[Intro]
Hey... you...

[Verse 1]
Looking good in that skirt
Flirting is the effective way that this works
Bingo 

[Shapow] how about we go
Down to the lake and eat a couple of pringles
Picnic by the way, hey I’m single
Pardon my bad manners, french and lingo
Intentions were (my intentions were) brighter than the summer
Reflection in the lake being seen by Stevie
You're a golden lady and it seems that me and you
We’re supposed to be the ozone team but who
Would have thought this conversation would have grew
Into me talking about sun rays with you!
I’m turning to a creep, that just won’t sleep
Next sex, that's cause you used to that kind of poo
See I'm the new shit in town
Lets mash together and make new browns
How that sound?

[Hook]
Hey, shit, it sounds cool to me
It sounds cool to me
Oh it sounds cool to me
It sounds cool to me!
It sounds cool to me!
It sounds cool to me!
Hey girl, that shit sounds cool to me!
Shit sounds good to me!

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
The fuck up, man
I don't need y'all niggas
I got me

[Verse 1]
Got a little soul
The world is a cold, cold place to be
Want a little warmth
But who's going to save a little warmth for me?
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train

[Verse 2]
If I'm born again
I know that the world will disagree
Want a little grace
But who's gonna say a little grace for me?

[Pre-Chorus]
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train

[Chorus]
I'm not excited, but should I be?
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
I know I love you, and you love the sea
But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me?

[Verse 3]
See the sun go down
It's going on down and the night is deep
Want a little light
But who's gonna save a little light for me?

[Pre-Chorus]
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train

[Chorus]
I'm not excited, but should I be?
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
I know I love you, and you love the sea
But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I'm not excited, but should I be?
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
I know I love you, and you love the sea
But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me?

Going off on...

Soba violence
Soba violence it's true
Soba violence
Soba violence it's you
The time had come bum rush him out the door
We were trying to help him out but he ended up kind of sore
The cops were sitting outside, but they were doing nothing about that

Soba violence
Soba violence it's true
(laughter)
Hey Mario, could you punch that
I know where you got to be going

You never knew my heart for you
Was monster size

You're a live wire
You're a live wire

Let me know if you want to check out for
The all time high

Short goodbyes
But you are something else, I love you

Oh, it's rollin'
Ok, very good, very good
Alright, everybody take one
1, 2, 3, 4

Hey there everybody
I'd like to tell everybody out there
A little story about someone that was very special to me
And this is a special song about that special someone
About just how special things can be, you know
I'm sure everybody out there has gone
Uh, felt, felt something very similar to that
And it can, uh, it can be the best thing
It can be the worst thing
It can make you feel great or

There Georgie girl
Oh, Georgie girl
Oh, hey, there Georgie girl, yeah
You can kiss that old crumb crack guy goodbye
Because you know, uh, yeah, baby, you know
You're on the one, the funky one
Oh, baby, yeah
Yo, you know, I saw you that day you
How's your girl, Mike?
Ah, she's pretty nice, man, but I tell you, yo
I saw the other girl at Netty's the other day
And she had her shit together
I'm talkin' about hip-hop, pow!
Boomin' system up top, in the back
Ah, hey there, Georgie girl
Georgie girl
Ah, baby, you look so nice
You on the one
You got your shit together Georgie girl
Yeah, you looking so nice Georgie girl
Georgie girl, you know you're on the one
Oh, hey, lonely girl

Yeah, that's right, baby, that was you the first time
You know, I saw you all alone
I was on the boardwalk, you know
You know, you were looking lovely
But lonely and uh
You know, you was squirting the water in the clown's mouth and everything
But, hey baby, you know I would win the whole prize for you
The whole nine yards, the, the skee ball tickets
Everything baby for you

[Verse 1: John Legend]
It gets harder everyday
But I can't seem to shake the pain
I'm trying to find the words to say, please stay
It's written all over my face
That I can't function the same when you're not here
Calling your name and no one's there

[Pre-Chorus]
And I hope one day you'll see nobody has it easy
I still can't believe you've found somebody new
But I wish you the best, I guess

[Chorus: John Legend]
Cause everybody knows, that nobody really knows
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt
We've heard it all before
That everybody knows just how to make it right
I wish we gave it one more try
One more try, One more try, One more try
Cause everybody knows, but nobody really knows

[Verse 2: John Legend]
I don't care what people say
They're probably lonely anyway
Baby don't fill up your head with he-said, she-said
It seems like you just don't know. (Don't know)
The radio's on, you're tuning me out
I'm trying to speak, you're turning me down

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know one day you'll see nobody has it easy
I still can't believe you've found somebody new
But I wish you the best, I guess

[Chorus: John Legend]
Cause everybody knows, that nobody really knows
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt
We've heard it all before
That everybody knows just how to make it right
I wish we gave it one more try
One more try, One more try, One more try
Cause everybody knows, but nobody really knows

[Bridge: John Legend]
Oh I wish you would understand
Just an ordinary man
I wish that we have known
That everybody knows, that nobody really knows

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know one day you'll see nobody has it easy
I still can't believe you've found somebody new
But I wish you the best, I guess

[Chorus: John Legend]
Cause everybody knows, that nobody really knows
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt
We've heard it all before
That everybody knows just how to make it right
I wish we gave it one more try
One more try, One more try, One more try
Cause everybody knows, but nobody really knows

[Intro]
Could you turn up the track a little bit please?

[Verse 1]
My mouth fell open
Hoping that the truth would not be true
Refuse the news
I'm feeling sick now
What the fuck am I supposed to do?
Just lose and lose

[Verse 2]
First time I saw you
You were sitting backstage in a dress
A perfect mess
You never knew this
But I wanted badly for you to
Requite my love

[Chorus]
Left on the floor
Leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way
So hard to stay
Guess now you know
I love you so

[Verse 3]
I liked your whiskers
And I liked the dimple in your chin
Your pale blue eyes
You painted pictures
'Cause the one that hurts can give so much
You gave me such

[Chorus]
Left on the floor
Leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way
So hard to stay
Guess now you know
I love you so

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Game]
And the kush became so strong
And the flights became private
And the bread became so long
Fast money and fly whips
We high, don't stop the smoke
And we fly G5, we so far from coach
Now you see why, when we high, can't stop the smoke
And we fly G5, we so far from coach

[Verse 1: Game]
Smokin' that Buddah fillin'
Blowin' that Kudda illin'
I'm runnin' through the millions
I'm sittin' roofless chillin'
Cooler than a polar bear
They flockin' cause they know it's there
Money gang, money straight
Like Joakim Noah hair
That's no bullshit, game time
Make you niggas change minds
Forfeit, or consume a full clip
Nigga like me eatin' swordfish
With your bitch, watchin' Swordfish
Niggas can't ignore this
You can't afford this - extravagant shit
We Louie Gucci Birkin baggin' this shit
Bag of the piff
Hot-boxin' in the back of the six
With Jimi Hendrix on... immaculate shit
Long way from... Compton
Where we used to, bag it in shifts with mags and the clips
Hurricane, right back on the shit
Back on the block with a package of spliffs
From blowin' cactus, the Wiz, what it is?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, you niggas want kush? We got ounces
Cookies we got pounds, clips we got rounds
Hundred thousand dollars when I skip through your town
Baller shit, don't even want a piece, man, we want all of it
Thirty thousand on the piece where my collar sit
Went so hard in the middle, East don't know what to call this shit
Now I'm buyin' up all the champagne
Drinkin' away all of my problems, bitch
Might sound crazy
But I just left the private plane, promoter paid 100k
And I ain't even stay the whole day
Hit the crib, bought a pound and smoked the whole thing
That Givency Men's collection, copped the whole thing
Not to mention all these diamonds in my gold ring
Made it to the top with nobody knowin'
Niggas say they safe, but nobody's showin'
Man he beats this shit, but nobody flowin'
Old Versace shit, the newest Rick Owens
If I'm rollin' it, you know that it's potent
With The Game and we smokin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
Hah, it's self-explanatory how we get it
Roll the purp in a plane ticket
Stat hop to that money, but I don't ribbit
Post playa ball, nice in the pivot, Jays on but I fuck with Pippin
Kays on when them niggas trippin'
Uh, pools of your partner blood, ya boy stay slippin'
Never tippin', stay sippin'
Court side, Blake Griffin
Stay missin', stackin' fitted while you niggas stay bitchin'
Coka and Boca, the kush of them strokers
Grand daddy and oova, blow that smoke to Jehovah
Four-fifty my motor, use your bitch for my chauffeur
I done Kobe'd the Cobra, Mark Price'd the Rover
T-top in the Trans, hit the gas and it's over
Bitch please, this is how we get them hoes the doja
I got shooters, I know growers from Vancouver
Plus I'm cooler than the cooler at your grandmomma's picnic
Bitch you?
Somethin' chill from Brazil, on the L
With Wiz and Game, my life is like Corona commercials
Family matters, Kevin Love at you Urkles
That's them wolves, niggas
They here to reverse birth you
Murk you, lights out no curfew
Bitch ain't stoppin' 'till my unborn seed's seed is rich
Or 'till Jesus sit right next to me and smoke 'till the seasons switch, my nigga

[Hook]
Ahh
Sad crew, sad crew
Hey, y'all, you see what they did to me?
There was two of these motherfuckers up here
I done took a picture with one already
You know what I sayin'? One was mine
So, where that Mike at?
Where that little bastard at? That little bastard that took that other one
Where you at?
Come here, man, come here, man, come here
I got seven motherfucking minutes so you gotta make this quick
See home-piss right here?

What you shame me for? What's wrong?
Nuttin' man

Alright, fuck it then

If you wanna find out, try me, ha!

Revelation
Actin' like the last generation on earth
You're gonna fuck up a place for new birth
You're cutting the last of the forests on the planet
Only a few hundred years since Columbus landed
Well it's due time that we look and pay attention
As the windows who knows show the knowledge with us
Cause it's the one that we prayed for, from on the earth
I give the wisdom to folks, you know whole worth
In these great times we still neglect
When they invent this land, don't give the due respect
Cause the FBI and the CIA
The whole federal government, the FDA
Well, the system doesn’t work and it must be changed
And there's more people in the pen everyday
So I visualize resolution
Yo, everyday is in a state of evolution

Evolution time
Evolution time
Revolution time
Revolution time
Revelation time
Revelation time
Resolution time
Resolution
We come a long way with the peace in the East
But on the home front, they're wild in the streets
As it gets got hear a changing in same
And this is the Millennium still felt today
I hear the same stories time after time
The stories of fear, through violent crimes
Committed by hatred by satient beings
Who shall loose by kindness and it's plain to see
Now we don't have to stand for this oppression any longer
If we stand together, there's nothing stronger
We must interconnect it as though we sure have won
If we want to avoid planetary destruction
So I work and I work because the hate in my mind
Has assumed the truth and I know I'll find
And I visualize resolution
See it all as a state of constant evolution

Evolution time
Evolution time
Revolution time
Revolution time
Revelation time
Revelation time
Resolution time
Resolution
The world leaders were terrified of loosing their pride
Their spoiled children tellin' little wack lies
Vanishing numbers of unimaginable destruction
Sure as we boast they're at their last production
Threatening and challenging nature against nation
Walkin' down the road of total annihilation
Sprouting threats is insecure
Guns are for the fighting and they're immature
And it all stems from self-important police
Thinking that we're better than our fellow human beings
So I wanna empower the limit I can
And pass it along so we can do pass the pan
Sometimes I sit and I watch my mind
Watchin' my thoughts as they reel and wind
And stop and visualize resolution
For everyday is in a state of evolution

Evolution time
Evolution time
Revolution time
Revolution time
Revelation time
Revelation time
Resolution time
Resolution
Well, I'm intergalactic, planetary
Planetary, intergalactic

Well the spice is the worm and the worm is the spice
I'll battle any alien when I'm on the mic
Like the Great Gazoo when I'm on the one
I phase motherfuckers when my mic's on stun
Satellite dish, spaceship communications
Gravity bonin', space fornication (yeah)
I'm getting stupider, when I'm on Jupiter
On Uranus, and that's just heinous
And my name is Mike D and
The first man on the moon with the three wood teeing
I was suspended in animation just the other day
Well I was in the night kitchen on the Milky Way
Because I'm getting funky with dilithium crystals
Lieutenant Uhura! *this is Kissel*

Warning! Warning!
We have intruders on sector G-7, level 9. Warning!
Now I'mma break it down with the Dr. Spock shit
Pinch ya buck naked leave ya in the cockpit
I'm like the cover of Jimmy Smith's 'Stay Loose'
Well I be breakin' in space in my gravity shoes
I got tickets to Interzone, so won'tcha beam me up
Hurricane's in orbit with *the scratchin' cuts*
I do-doodle on the paper like my name was scheme
Your galaxy is my bombin' theme
Well I'm worth your while, while you're while I'm worth
*Planet Rhymeon is my place of birth*

I fall like Shawn Kemp from the Supersonics
I got the coded double kick with the phat catonics
I'll be in the crator and you know I slapped it

Planetary, intergalactic

Battlestar one, in G-Son
We're gonna rock the universe for everyone
We're gonna rock the universe for everyone
We're gonna rock the universe for everyone
We're gonna rock the universe for everyone

So Mario, rock the universe
So Hurricane, rock the universe
So Money Mark, rock the universe
So Bobo, rock the universe
So Awol, rock the universe
And everyone, rock the universe
And everyone, rock the universe
And everyone
Like stacks of thoughts
Got tired and worn
Used over and over 'till they were tired and torn
Like a broken clock that can’t tell time
Like a thick ass book mine that’s mine
Like a band…

That’ll be fine
Alright
It’ll be fun more than fine, I think
No, I think it’ll be fun and fine
See, that’s what we’re trying to get, to get
That’s... That’s the... You’re in that place again
In that special place again. (someone burps)
Oh, I’m so happy to be in that special place again. (laughing)
I love the place I’m in
I’m in that perfect headspace again. (more laughing)
(*a small tune*) Oooh, woo, woo, woo
Don’t get in my headspace baby
Hey, Mario

[Intro: Sevyn Streeter]
I want you to love me
Like you've never loved nobody else

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I don't know if it's your scent or your kiss
But girl, I love it
And time after time
You give me one of the greatest gifts
I want you to—

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
I want you to love me (Mmm)
Like you never loved nobody else (Oh, oh)
And I want you to touch me (Touch me, I just want you to feel it, girl)
Like when you're touching yourself (Ayy, yeah, baby)

[Verse 2: Sevyn Streeter, Chris Brown & Both]
So baby, come over
I'm on my way, girl
If you take your time, you can love me right
Can I love ya? Uh-huh
Take ya time, girl
If you want me to slow it down
I do, will you?
I will, will you? I will
Oh-oh
I'm biting on the pillow, trying not to make a sound
Girl, it's okay 'cause I want you to feel me, yeah, oh
'Cause you're daddy's girl
I'ma show you how to love, show you how to love me, girl
So lay down right there, oh
So you can hold my head while I'm kissing on your thighs
Girl, I just need it one more time

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
I want you to love me (I want you, baby)
Like you never loved nobody else (Oh, can you do me, girl?)
And I want you to touch me (Touch me, like when you're touching yourself)
Like when you're touching yourself

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
And as I look into your eyes, your body screams for my love
No fear, just me
And as you feel me inside, my passion fits like a glove
No more fear, just you and me

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Sevyn Streeter & Both]
I want you to love me (Ooh)
Oh-whoa-oh-oh (Hey!)
Like you never loved nobody else
Like you never, like you never, like you never (Oh)
And I want you to touch me
Touch me, touch me, I just want you to feel it, girl
Like when you're touching yourself
Ayy, oh, oh-na-na-na

[Intro: Action Bronson speaking]
Yeah
It’s me
I’m here
Swerve
Light it

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Yo
I’m on the PCH, smokin’ THC
With the team, money be the dream
I take it multicolor baby, it ain’t gotta be green
On the other side of earth with the queen, I’m from Queens
Shit, 3 different types of forks for a Monday lunch
Tamarind punch, higher than a javelin jump
Italian sluts, my whole battalion is nuts
We rock medallions and such
Don’t even step within six feet of my presence
Leave you open like the desert, Def Leopard, Fresh pepper
Did I mention, steer the whip with one arm like Jim Abbott
Chocolate sauce over thin rabbit
If these opportunities arose before we would’ve been had it
Shorty sniffing haddock in the attic
I been an addict in these streets, in my pants I’ve even shatted
Then sat in it, sadly
Two things about to cop a few rings
And eat paper thin slices of the Blue Ling
Shoot eagles on a Jack Nicklaus course, Porsche with the triple exhaust
Seats soft like a midget’s cough
*coughs*
Yeah, let’s hear that fly shit
*coughs*
Yeah man
Oh fuck

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
I never thought that this could be my life
Russian mistress and Parisian wife
Always seasoned rice, the animals you find in the jungle on the table sculpted in ice
Throw the dice
Leg drop after a big boot
1, 2, 3, it’s over, slide in the mint coupe
Dive out the chopper in the water, uh
No splash, Olympic shit
Ayo, the spliff look like a shrimp when it shit
Smoke the shark, Greg Norman shit, me and Robert Horry in a foreign whip
Motherfucka I was born to live
And born to fuck a lot of pussy without spawning kids
It’s me

[Intro: Willie Nelson]
You know Snoopy a little while back
I had one of those, carpal tunnel operations
And the doctor said "I want you to go home and
SHUT UP (mm) for four months," and that's kinda tough
I said "I'll try it," but while I was there
I wrote this song

[strums his guitar]

[Willie Nelson]
Too many pain pills, too much pot
Tryin to be somethin that I'm not - Superman! Superman
Tryin to do more than I can, I got a little outta hand
I ain't Superman - know what I'm talkin 'bout?

[Snoop Dogg]
I blew my throat and I blew my tour
I wound up sippin on soup du jour - I wasn't Superman
Oh no, I wasn't Superman
I'm tryin to do more than I can, I got a little outta hand
I wasn't Superman

[Willie Nelson]
I hear ya! Mickey play with us

[Harmonica Solo]

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, play that Mickey, go ahead!
Play it Willie!

[more harmonica]
Yeah... go ahead Willie

[Willie Nelson]
Well the doctor said son it's a cryin shame
But you ain't Clark Kent and I ain't Lois Lane
You ain't Superman; you ain't Superman
Tryin to do more than you can, you got a little outta hand
You ain't Superman - whaddya think Snoop?

[Snoop Dogg]
Well when I die, put it on my stone
God said Snoop you take your bad ass home you wasn't Superman, Ha ha ha
No, I wasn't Superman
I'm tryin to do more than I can, I got a little outta hand
I wasn't Superman (I hear ya!)

[Both]
Tryin to do more than I can, I got a little outta hand
I ain't Superman, yeah

[Verse 1]
Anticipation has the habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment, but
Tonight there'll be some love
Tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah
Regardless of what's gone before
I want to see all of the things that we've already seen
The lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
Of course it's fancy dress
And they're all looking quite full on
In bunny ears and devil horns and how

[Verse 2]
Anticipation has the habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment, but
Tonight there'll be some love
Tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah
Regardless of what's gone before
I want to see all of the things that we've already seen
I wanna see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine
And put it all back in
You've got to understand that
You can never beat the bandit, no

[Chorus]
And she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
When she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
And there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
And all that it says is that you've drank a lot
And you should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that in mind
Yeah, you should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that in mind

[Post-Chorus]
And you can pour your heart out but her reasoning will block
Owt you send her after nine o' clock

[Verse 3]
Anticipation has the habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment, but
Tonight there'll be some love, oh
Tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah
Regardless of what's gone before

[Chorus]
And she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
When she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
And there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
And all that it says is that you've drank a lot
And you should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that in mind
Yeah, you should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that in mind

[Post-Chorus]
And you can pour your heart out around three o' clock
When the two-for-one's undone the writer's block

[Intro]
Yeah, new shit (I'm freaking you)
Usher, baby
Mr. double T-L-O, y'all know what they say (I'm freaking you)
I bet you're feeling me stare, the moment is real
But I know you ain't serious 'cause I (I'm freaking you)
But I know you're prepared, we won't make it up the stairs
And you came over here, that mean you gon' be (fucking)
Usher, baby
Turn the lights on

[Verse 1]
I just want your undivided
You should let me penetrate your everything
You've got me beyond excited
Baby, step into my room, I'm your groom
Don't need a wedding ring

[Pre-Chorus]
I think sex was made for strangers
Making love is for the ones who plan to stay together
How 'bout we embrace the danger?
Girl, I'm pretty sure when it's all said and done
We gon' do a whole lot of...
We gon' do a whole lot of...

[Chorus]
I ain't gotta be your man, you ain't gotta be my girl
Let's let go of everything they taught you in this world
We gon' do a whole lot of...
I'm freaking you
I'm freaking you

[Verse 2]
Listen, I'm not into fantasizing
I'd much rather put my hands on everything
I just hope that I'm invited
Up into your room, I'm your groom
But I ain't got a wedding ring

[Pre-Chorus]
I think sex was made for strangers
Making love is for the ones who plan to stay together
How 'bout we embrace the danger?
Girl, I'm pretty sure when it's all said and done
We gon' do a whole lot of...
We gon' do a whole lot of...

[Chorus]
I ain't gotta be your man, you ain't gotta be my girl
Let's let go of everything they taught you in this world
We gon' do a whole lot of...

[Bridge]
Hey, can't deny what's here between us
Right now
I can hear your heart beating
Oh, tonight would be so dangerous
(You know you want to, listen)
We gon' do a whole lot of...
(Hey, you gotta take it from me
Just, uh, listen to yourself)
We gon' do a whole lot of...
(You know you want to, yeah)

[Chorus]
I ain't gotta be your man, you ain't gotta be my girl
Let's let go of everything they taught you in this world
We gon' do a whole lot of...

[Outro]
I'm freaking you
No expectations on a first name basis
Let's get together and exchange (fuck) faces
I'm freaking you

[Verse 1]
Times are critical, although I kick the metaphysical
Sometimes my rhymes flow kind of political
All the real B-boys make noise
Here comes the bomb yo, please stay calm yo, see I'm though
Happy chappy wind up and slap me one hitter, critter
Each year, I'm bigger, thicker, lyrics moving quicker
It's true, I got more styles up there
So I'll put it together and come out with an album every single year
Listen here, something new is going on
So of course Blast Master says it faster in a song
As you noticed the Bush Administration
Dealt with foreign affairs through the United Nations
In the UN, the Europeans have seniority
Yet in the world of nations, whites are the minority
This doesn't balance out for no nation
Check it, the UN is like the world plantation
There's more dark skin force than white forces
But Europeans are raping their resources
To be more specific while I'm rhyming
Resources mean oil, gold, minerals, diamonds
Anything to make the European riches a minority
They need this but there's one glitch
They concentrated much on international
But not enough on the thinking of the national
So while the Bush administration was outside
Yes the Clinton administration will be inside
Anything that affects the way you think
In music, in television, in writing, or out of the shrink
Cause if you start bugging within the nation
That messes up with what goes on in other nations
Not only Blacks but whites are starting to see the hypocrisy
Cause they're fed up with the economy
They're not uniting Europe for Europeans
They're uniting Europe to enslave the world of human beings
So rise up, there's little time to dance
To the youth in Great Britain, U.S., and France
Never forget, you might have to set it
Yo, things are getting hectic

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
If I can make you think there's something's wrong in my song
Then my song is a threat to what's going on
We've had years of free debate
Now they're gonna clean out rap in every single state
You'll see less and less on your television
And you'll see more and more violence and tongue kissing
Before I leave this point, I'll give you more
Explicit lyrics stickers is supported by Tipper Gore
Al Gore's wife, a White House resident
Vice president to the president, I think you're getting it
Rap music has the most influence yet, you bet
So now, it's a military threat
Anything that changes how you feel changes how you act
That's a threat, and that's rap
Racist mothers and fathers hate Black
But their children be chilling with Black kicking that rap
More and more White kids feel what we feel
You'll see more White kids with a mic on the wheels of steel
And that ain't the global plan
I haven't even discussed Japan
Japanese youth love Black youth
In Japan, there's no racists in the DJ booth
Just truth, screaming from the microphone
So the object is to shut down the head right here at home
Never forget it, you might have to set it
Yo, things are getting hectic

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
Lay your head on my pillow
Here you can be yourself
No one has to know what you are feeling
No one but me and you, ooh

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
I feel such a connection
Even when you're far away, mmm
Ooh baby, if there's anything that you fear (Anything)
Call 489-4608 and I'll be here

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & (Tony! Toni! Toné!)]
I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me (Safe with me)
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary
Yeah, mmm, yeah

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
And only we know what is talked about, baby boy
I don't know how you can be driving me so crazy, boy
Baby, when you're in town, why don't you come around, boy?
I'll be the loyalty you need, you can trust me, boy

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & (Tony! Toni! Toné!)]
Oh, I won't tell (No, no, no) your secrets
(I will never, never, never)
Your secrets are safe with me (Safe with me)
I will keep (I will keep) your secrets (Your)
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

[Outro: Alicia Keys & Tony! Toni! Toné!]
Everybody say whoa, whoa
Lemme hear you say whoa, whoa
Lemme hear you say whoa, whoa
I'm saying whoa, whoa
Lemme hear you say
I won't tell, I won't tell
I won't tell, I won't tell
I won't tell, I won't tell
Your secrets, your secrets
Break it down, oh
Secrets, secrets

[Hook: John Legend & Meek Mill]
Look how far we came (look how far we come)
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
It feel like yesterday when all this was a dream (yesterday)
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed
Look how far we came (I think I'ma dedicate this one)
To all the people that thought I wouldn't make it here
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign (Dreamchasers)
It feel like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, it was all a dream, on the corner servin' all them fiends
Me and a bunch of my niggas, yeah, we was all a team
The system labeled us killas, but momma called us kings
Walked through the hall of a prison, now it's the hall of fame
And people got the nerve to ask why I wear all these chains
When I was booked, they had me shackled to the wall of shame
So I'm just representin', better yet just reminiscin'
Put down on that Bentley truck, I used to want the Expedition
Now it's bigger things, grew up and got bigger dreams
Cause in my hood, niggas try to smoke you just like nicotine
And this money shit ain't funny, all the shit it brings
You bound to lose your family and your friends, boy this shit is mean
And birthdays was the worst days
Last week I made a hundred on a Thursday
And Club Liv got me sinnin' on a church day
Stevie J all on the mic, he screamin' out my birthplace
Philly, we back!

[Hook: John Legend]
Look how far we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
It feel like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed

[Verse 2: Nas]
Haha, yo
I'm blunted, you wanna see life's meaning?
On the radio, Al Green, while mom's cleanin'
Mom's singing along with the songs
And shortly I learned the words to 'em, Nerf balls, I threw 'em
But now I'm a perfectionist to a fault like Jesus
Judgin' his own miracles, but he won't cause he automatic
I'm like an old blues singer living in the bottle
Whose wife left him down in the bottom
Writing songs is how we solvin' the problem
My liquid money's a hypnotist to your misses
Lay back like I'm in the chair of a dentist
Nasir relentless, a freak like Prince is, mystique like Sade
Soon as I enter people, point and see my anointment
I ain't tryna do too much
Same time, I ain't no bum nigga not doin' enough
But I ain't tryna do no dumb shit, chasin' my tail in a circle
I made it so I'm chillin' now, transparent ceiling now
Nas and Meek killin', hah, wow! (Yeah, we did it, baby)

[Hook: John Legend & Rick Ross]
Look how far we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
It feel like yesterday when all this was a dream
You dreaming of nightmares, you dreaming of nightmares
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed
Let's go

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
The chorus cinematic, going back to Cali
Young street nigga, late 80's suede Bally's
Jewels like Rick the Ruler, looking like I ripped the jeweler
I could cut a check, make some people hit your shooter
Domino effect, you in that magic city
Where all they do is flex; call it Milli Vanilli
Coming from the bottom, my lil' nigga from Philly
Young legend outta Queens, take over city to city
Honor thy mother, go to war for my brother
Giving sufficient funds to significant others
Went from poor now women screamin' for my signature
More war came from the bottom so I know the war
Never worn, always on, y'all niggas luke warm
Talking cash over salads, heavy croûtons
Cuban links equivalent to having suits on
Stretch Maybachs 'til they bring the coupes on

[Hook: John Legend]
Look how far we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
It feel like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed
Look how far we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
It feel like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed

[Intro]
Ayy
Cole World
Forreal

[Verse 1]
Look at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought
You mix greed, pain and fame, this is heinous result
Let these words be the colors, I'm just paintin' my heart
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought
Copped a Range Rover, my girl got the Mercedes
Iced out crazy, I wanna shine like Baby
Compared to that nigga I ain't even got a bib yet
Truth be told I ain't even bought a crib yet
This is everything they told a nigga not to do
Image is everything I see, it got a lot to do
With the way people perceive, and what they believe
Money short so this jewelry is like a weave
Meant to deceive and hear niggas say: "I see you"
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you
And police wanna stop you, frisk you wonder what he do
If a hater snatch your chain, I bet it still won't free you
'Cause I be right back grinding 'til I cop another
I sit and think about all this shit I coulda copped my mother
My partner said that's just the game my nigga
Swear I heard my jeweler say, "Here go your chain my nigga"
This is chaining day

[Chorus]
I need you to love me (Chaining day), love me (Ohh my chaining day)
I need you to love me (My chaining day), love me
My last piece, I swear
My guilt heavy as this piece I wear (Love me, love me, hey hey)
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear (Love me, love me)
They even iced out Jesus' hair

[Verse 2]
Ice on this white Jesus seem a little unholy
The real strange thing about this iced out Roley
It's the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at
Same shit a rich white motherfucka laugh at
Well laugh on white man, I ain't paid as you
But I bet your rims ain't the same age as you
And I ain't got no investment portfolio
But my black and white diamonds shinin' like a Oreo
I know back home a nigga sick today
He rock a chain and he always got some shit to say
Even back when I was broke I knew his shit was fake
He'd prolly sneeze too hard and his shit could break
But hey, you know the sayin', "Fake it 'til you make it"
Me, I did the opposite, made it then I faked it
And acted like I gave a fuck, money I was savin' up
To buy a crib that's gated 'til hundred racks, I gave it up
For what

[Chorus]
I need you to love me (Chaining day), love me (Ohh, my chaining day)
I need you to love me (My chaining day), love me
My last piece, I swear
My guilt heavy as this piece I wear (Love me, love me, hey hey)
They even iced out Jesus' hair
My last piece, I swear (Love me, love me)

[Verse 3]
Lord, this is the last time (hehe)
Told my accountant, "It's the last time
I swear this is the last time
I know that I said that shit last time
But this the last time"
Mama I swear this is the last time
So don't take my chains from me
This the last time
'Cause I chose this slavery
This is the last time
Don't take my chains from me
This is the last time
'Cause I love this slavery

[Outro]
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I need you to love me, love me, love me
I said this is my last time

[Verse 1]
Long distance runner, what you standin there for?
Get up, get out, get out of the door
You're playin cold music on the barroom floor
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Verse 2]
Almost ablaze still you don't feel the heat
It takes all you got just to stay on the beat
You say it's a livin, we all gotta eat
But you're here alone, there's no one to compete
If mercy's a business, I wish it for you
More than just ashes when your dreams come true

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Verse 3]
Long distance runner, what you holdin out for?
Caught in slow motion in a dash for the door
The flame from your stage has now spread to the floor
You gave all you had. why you wanna give more?
The more that you give, the more it will take
To the thin line beyond which you really can't fake

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I know my body took a lot of ink
Know I smoke a lot of stink
Bladder piss a lot of pink
Because that lean I like to drink
My face got a lot of tats
My grill got a lot of gold
My mouth talk a lot of shit
My dick fuck a lot of hoes
My stomach be filled with shrimp, Legs limping like a pimp
Gazelles on my fucking frame, waves all in my temp
My mind it be on the prize, hands on with the nine
My traphouse it keep a line, because I'm selling Duncan Hines
Gucci Mane a millionaire, my house I be seldom there
I always be on the road, bank account got several 0's
My britches be True Religion, in the kitchen cooking chickens
Smoking Swishers, busting Phillies, bought two raris, spent a million

[Hook]

Popping pills on Sunset

Kids with guns

They're mesmerized
Skeletons

[Refrain: 2D]
Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it
They got something to say no to

[Verse 2: 2D & Neneh Cherry]
Drinking out (Push it real)
Pacifier (Push it real, push it)

The street desire (Push it real, push it)
Doesn't make sense to (Push it, push it real)
But it won't be long (Push it real, push it)

[Refrain: 2D]
Kids with guns
Kids with guns

Now they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire
Turning us into monsters

Easy does it, easy does it

After day, after night come
Don't, don't kill me now
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: 2D]
I lost my leg like I lost my way
So no loose ends
Nothing to see me down
How are we going to work this out?

[Verse 2: 2D]
Dreams are bad, our heads are mad
I love the girl
But God only knows it's
Getting hard to see the sun coming through
I love you
But what are we going to do?

[Verse 3: 2D]
Picture I'm a dreamer, I'll take you deeper
Down to the sleepy glow
Time is a low
Don't you know?
What are we going to do?

[Verse 4: 2D]
When we go down
For all the sacred selfless days
Only left with heartache
I want to see you again
I love you
But what are we going to do?

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1: 2D]
Got off a plane to the countryside
I drove to the mountain and a hole in the ground
There was crack on the corner and someone dead
And fire coming out of a monkey's head

[Chorus: The London Community Gospel Choir]
Don't get lost in heaven
They got locks on the gate
Don't go over the edge
You'll make a big mistake

[Verse 2: 2D]
Put me in a cab to suburbia
I just took a line, but it wasn't with ya
There was more of it there when I got back home
But you'd left me, you don't know my soul
You're a ho, girl
Yeah, you're a hobo

[Chorus: The London Community Gospel Choir]
Don't get lost in heaven
They got locks on the gate
Don't go over the edge
You'll make a big mistake

[Outro: The London Community Gospel Choir]
You’ll make a big mistake, ah
You’ll make a big mistake, ah
You’ll make a big mistake, ah
You’ll make a big mistake, ah

[Chorus: 2D]
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?

[Verse 1: 2D]
Take a gun, or how you say
That's no way you behave
You're just alone when you begin
To sing a song that doesn't sing
It grows (Hey)
You know

[Chorus: 2D]
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?

[Verse 2: 2D]
Are we the last to get away
To a sun, another day?
Or do we know what we know?
It doesn't seem to be conveyed that way

[Chorus: 2D]
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Could go the last living soul

[Interlude: 2D]
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Lord, save me

[Bridge: 2D]
'Cause all out of song
I got it down and wrong
I see myself to get
The long all-seeing road down
You come and take a sound
I bought the car made up
The coldest man
He doesn't say it's wrong

[Verse 3: 2D]
We go to the car
I see you walk into the fog
And when you get there, what do you see?
You fit the last you need on me

[Chorus: 2D]
'Cause we're the last living souls
We're the last living souls
Yeah, we're the last living souls
We're the last living souls

[Intro]
Cole World, the new Nat King
If I ain't the illest nigga, I'm his new vaccine
Really more like poison when his New Jack Swing
And my bed is like a deck of cards - two black queens
A nigga don't like me, he just a fucking hater
What you made last week, I just tipped the fucking waiter
What that feel like? Tell me what that feel like?
Nigga fuck your Twitter, bitches follow me in real life

[Interlude]
Welcome back, ladies and gentleman, to a brand new season. Dreamville, Cole World. So much has happened in our time apart
I can’t wait to share it with you all in due time. Did you miss me?
I know I missed you. Can’t believe these niggas ain’t rap on this shit man...

[Verse 1]
Heard niggas got beef
Then they see me on the street, and don't speak
Heard niggas dropping songs every week, but they weak
Yeah, I heard about your deal, hope they keep the receipt
Heard niggas out there saying I would be Memphis Bleek
Well, how you feel when that nigga got mills?
And you sitting, commenting, discussing on how you feel
Bout another nigga shit, or another nigga chips
Meanwhile I’m on the strip, putt puttin’ wit ya bitch
Cut something in the 6 then dip to 160
Bitch don’t fuck with me, trust nigga I’m sick
Can’t tag me, fuck nigga I’m it—watch this
With my heart on my sleeve I bleed pardon my greed
I plead insanity, with a side of vanity
How can it be I blew up singlehandedly
Nobody handed me shit
Granted though, I planned to be rich
Understandably, funny how I talk so candidly
On cameras but won’t holla at family only randomly
After a few drinks come our realest convos
My handle on my thoughts used to be as ill as Rondo’s
Screaming fuck whitey, forgetting I’m still mulatto
Ay reverend, will I get to heaven, he said “hell if I know,” shit
Stay scheming, day dreaming, chain gleaming
Name should be Abe Lincoln ‘cause I cannot tell a lie though
All facts in fact, been all that
Before Kenan and Kel swallow the key to my cell
Which means, I got an impossible lock to pick
And if you want my spot, you gotta go through lots of shit
Nigga, Cole the truth, you the opposite
I be tryna figure out why I cannot commit
With who I’ve known for years, is it hoes or fear
Meanwhile she wonder if the one she chose is pure
No cure for the cold, rather Cole the cure
Them last lines was more honest than your whole career
Nigga, you a phony, only got few homies
I prefer lonely, you rap niggas don’t know me
Staying to myself, not concerned ‘bout my health
I’m a mothafucka and yo baby mother is a milf
Couple years ago they had a nigga sitting on the shelf
Now they tell me “man you like the realest shit I ever smelt”
They say, “Boy you got the belt"
"Plus you better than so-and-so!”
I keep it modest but inside I already know it though
Yea thanks my nigga, yea thanks my nigga
I deserve but nah this ain’t Tank my nigga
Leave the party like I just robbed a bank my nigga
Bag full of money, fuck yo debate my nigga
‘Cause two years ago and I ain’t make it, I was pissed
But you care a little less about a list when you rich, nigga
When you rich nigga...

[Interlude]
But that’s not what we came here for. We didn’t come here to brag; we didn’t come here to boast, to stunt. We just came here to flex. Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate your patience. I assure you, it’ll be well worth the wait. In the meantime, if I can get right back into it though. Check it...

[Verse 2]
How many Kanye beats do a nigga gotta murder
To prove my mind’s further, hater nigga converter
Took kids to Carowinds which I’m sure you never heard of
‘Cause I didn’t tell the news or the Fayetteville Observer
I don’t do it for the press, I’m blessed, I made it out
Sitting on this plane, my biggest thing to complain about
Somewhere between yesterday and now
I done lost my jewelry, Rollies, chains, almost lost my cool
But see, I just left kids who ain’t got a fucking thing
‘Cept a lot of fucking problems and a lot of fucking pain
And here I go bitching ‘cause my Jesus piece missing
Got a feeling housekeeping finally caught a nigga slipping
Eyes wide open, they just found a pot of gold
Now lil’ Julio is somewhere shining on you hoes
But that’s how it goes, fuck it I’m still breathing
Like my lil’ nigga Jaheim, we here for a reason

[Outro]
That’s my lil’ man Jaheim. He said, “Cole, can you shout me out on a song?” I was like, “I don’t know man,” but in my mind I knew I would shout him out though, you know—Fayettenam, 2-6. Dreamville. We from a different world. Cole World...

[Intro: Mac Miller & Yung Brody]
Yo, we here to do it for the weed smokers, right? Haha

Easy Mac, Brody
Chyeah, ayy, put your L's up, 'Burgh
Light another one, then roll another one too (

[?])
Shit's cracked, dog (Haha, you know)

[Verse 1: Yung Brody]
Yo, yo, that Cali dro', woah, and I'm good to go
Single box of duchy-palmer's (Single box)
And them niggas gettin' blowed, yo
Shorty drop it low and she started gettin' dough
She sayin' that she celibate, but God know that she still a ho
Yo, is you feelin' me?
Yeah, yeah, I'm chillin', B (Chillin')
Puffin' on that Perc', nigga, I can feel it killin' me
We opened up the bag of white and then it started spillin' keys (Oh, share that)
And I stay high like a credit card billin' fee (Props to that)
I'm killin' these faggots that be grillin' me (Yeah)
Blunt full of 

[?] tree, and nobody as real as me
Supply the man, how I'm flippin', movin' all the scrill on trees
Niggas talk, I'm blowin' out they necks like a guillotine

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I think I'm in love with this bud (Haha)
With this bud (Yo, roll that shit up, 

[?])
With this bud (That strawberry cough)
I think I'm in love with this bud (You know what I'm sayin'?)
With this bud (Ayy, this beat got me crazy)
With this bud (Yo)
With this bud (Look, yeah)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
It's what you want (Ha), it's what you need (What you need)
You got the blunt (Heh), I got the weed
You got the soil (Soil), I got the seed (Seed)
Yo, you want to smoke? (A-ha) Yes, indeed
High as hell, fly as well, come on, homie, try to sell
Got that stinky kush that make you cry when you try and smell
Like an onion, youngin', marijuana lovin'
See, we sharin', always carin', so we passin' while we puffin' (Passin' while we puffin')
This bud make me hover like a motherboard spaceship
Roll a swish filled with fresh piff, then I face it (Then I face it)
I can't feel my face like I'm faceless (Holy shit)
All dressed up, gettin' Mary Jane wasted
Have you ever smoked bud in the club when you puff 'til the night's gone?
Eyes so red that I had to put my sights on (Chyeah)
In an L, out the bong, in a spliff, out the bowl
Yeah, that stinky kush, so you know you gotta have some more

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I think I'm in love with this bud
With this bud
With this bud
I think I'm in love with this bud
With this bud
With this bud
With this bud

[Outro: Yung Brody & Mac Miller]
That's right
Bitch-ass niggas, dog
Can't touch me and Easy, dog
Easy Mac, Yung Brody, Y.B., muhfucker
Get used to them muhfuckin' names, pussies
Yo, I'm way too blowed, yo, we need to—
Shut—shut this down
Aight, peace

[Verse 1]
They got one eye watching you
One eye on what you do
So be careful who it is you're talking to
They got one eye watching you
One eye on what you do
So be careful what it is you're trying to do
And be careful when you're walking into view
Just be careful when you're walking into view

[Hook]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on

[Verse 2]
They got one eye watching you
And one eye on what you do
So be careful 'cause nothing they say is true
No, don't believe a word
It's just us against the world
And we just got to turn up to be heard
Hear the crocodiles ticking 'round the world
Hear those crocodiles ticking, they go ticking 'round the world

[Hook]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on

[Bridge]
You could hear them climbing the stairs
I got my right side fighting while my left hides under the chairs

[Hook]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on
'The days go by we argue all the time
I wanna make it right, cuz that was last night'
Babe we gon be no allright, no allright
You turned it I turned it we turned it all wrong
Theres no point in hold on >allright<
Im gonna move on, cut right?
Nthin btween us was ever right
So have we thought we could make things work
Like they ain't wrong, babe youre wrong

Since day one
It was always the same
Always fussin and fightin
For nothin or it all
Was laughin and creepin
Sth btween seemed so strong

I dont see a point in
Actin like its ok
But I dont even wana fight anymore
Cuz fightin was ours, it was OUR game
And seems we never knew each other
Nothing I thought you are I could now say is sure
I wanted to win
And if it was your turn it was ok
It wasn't you against whom I played
We played together
Like we could
Like we would and feel like lovers
I could count on you
To care, to be there
I could say its worth
The smallest little sth that we both share

You played, I played
We played it nearly every day
I thought it was our game
Even though I knew about the serious matters
We were discussin
It was our way to show we care
Cuz we both played our cool with a heart nowhere
No love to share
So fighting meant
You are worth passion, worth energy
Fighting meant
If you play it right today, you get a little maybe
If we play good we warm each other up
-But now is time to clean the flame, close the lights, give up
I played
Cuz somehow..i felt
Am strong have principles and all that
Independent, know what I got
You know where to put me which level
But we played a game
To each other with each other
We wanted nothing less than highscore
With love chosen to cheat on
Dont know if we both intended the same
Can't guess how much was real, how deep was the play'n

We played
And I let you in
You wanted and tried hard
To let it all begin
And I was too good for you to knock out easily
To good to moan out everythin you wanted from me
But somehow it wasn't only fun
-By time I got to know someone..

And what you were, when you were next to me
Seemed matching on someone touchable
Feelable for me
What you were on my sight
Was like a mirror I could see me through
Your eyes could beat in your vibe
We played
I know we messed it up, chosen the worst game to play on
Both with fear of nothing
More than the way feelin can make you get weak
Dont know if I believed you were too weak for me
To let it hurt, make me ever unhappy
Or if I thought you were more
Someone any pain I would be willin to pay for

But in the end, we messed it up
The gain was nothin our debts been love
And seems now my hearts stagnatin, always on repeat
Not knowin the rhythm havin lost its beat
My mind always with the same words
Move on move on move one
Your strong
But its wrong
Ive chosena be weak
Chosena feel
Now I feel strong only if you was with me
Yet not weak enough to stay
Yet too proud to cut it, interrupt it
Stop to make it go on, make it play

I thought it was all fun
And id never be jelous of you
Thought we were just playin
It was nothin real, nothin true

But now. I can't touch you anymore
Your scent could make me cry
Was that what you were lookin for..?
I ain't ask you, ainta say tell me why

Cuz we always played
From the very beginning
I started, sure that id be the part winning
And you know that.i would have
I had the choice
But I listened to my innerselfe'voice
Felt like 'give it a try' felt like 'it could be special'
Like 'Youre special in your way
The opposite within the same.'

And we got deeper every day
I got used to our time used to our game
I got used to smellya every day
Used to your voice sayin -the kind you doin- my name
But somehow it wasn't like routine, isnt that what bores me the most
We made it feel different
One day we found each other, one day we let each other stay lost

You was someone, not different than others
And I was always cold to you, how come you yet felt like we lovers
Haven't you felt anything dont tell me that
Yesterday I seen in your eyes that you do regret
And noone regrets, that ain't missin what he had
Noone turns the best so quickly to sth bad
If he wouldn't feel
You hate, dont tellme you dont hate me simetomes
So letme tellya, babe you musve loved me
Isnt that what hate defines..?

Nothingtheless. you opened up your body for other's lust
I dont know what was the bounty but I know whatyo lost
And I ain't ever touch you like I did befo
Senseful, loveful, always wantin to stay a little more
And I ain't ever feel like I did befo
You had me like wax in your fingers
Ain't have me at all anymore

You fingers touched others than mine
Your lips are marked different now I can tell you were lyin
You were EVERYTHING just yesterday, I felt youre all mine
Today is diffrent, seems you just lost someone
Dont know if it was worth to have others on top of you
First time im honest to myself. just the thought of it raises me, feelin a fire burnin in me
Youve chosen not to talk at all ere you did, thats what I gonna do now
Just lemme tell yo babe. see ill always stay ON TOP of your list
But never again by your sight, next to you

We always fighted, my heart stupidly chosen to be yours all over
And you been chosin to treat me like I mean nthin to ya
Once we played a game, these days gone now we ain't have that no more
I was you addict
Now I healed myself ain't ever been stronger
You thinkin by urself when you see me
Wasn't she mine, wasn't I hers, you missin, but we ain't ever be no longer
No longer anything
Your rulin, you gambled, now last round
We play, but
The games already over. gameovergameovergameover

[Verse 1]
I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
Traveling, traveling, traveling
Looking for something, what can it be?
Oh, I hate you some, I hate you some, I love you some
Oh, I love you when I forget about me

[Chorus 1]
I want to be strong, I want to laugh along
I want to belong to the living
Alive, alive, I want to get up and jive
I want to wreck my stockings in some jukebox dive
Do you want, do you want, do you want to dance with me, baby?
Do you want to take a chance
On maybe finding some sweet romance with me, baby?
Well, come on

[Verse 2]
All I really, really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you too
All I really, really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you

[Chorus 2]
I want to talk to you, I want to shampoo you
I want to renew you again and again
Applause, applause, life is our cause
When I think of your kisses, my mind see-saws
Do you see, do you see, do you see how you hurt me, baby?
So I hurt you too
Then we both get so blue

[Verse 3]
I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
Looking for the key to set me free
Oh, the jealousy, the greed is the unraveling
It's the unraveling and it undoes all the joy that could be

[Chorus 3]
I want to have fun, I want to shine like the sun
Want to be the one that you want to see
I want to knit you a sweater
Want to write you a love letter
I want to make you feel better
I want to make you feel free
Want to make you feel free
I want to make you feel free

[Verse 1]
My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark

[Chorus]
We don't need no piece of paper from the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man keeping away my blues

[Verse 2]
He's my sunshine in the morning
He's my fireworks at the end of the day
He's the warmest chord I ever heard
Play that warm chord, play and stay, baby

[Chorus]
We don't need no piece of paper from the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man keeping away my blues

[Bridge]
But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide

[Verse 3]
Then he comes home
And he takes me in his loving arms
And he tells me all his troubles
And he tells me all my charms

[Chorus]
We don't need no piece of paper from the city hall
Keeping us tied and true, no
My old man keeping away my blues

[Bridge]
But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide

[Verse 4]
My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark

[Chorus]
We don't need no piece of paper from the city hall
Keeping us tied and true, no
My old man keeping away my lonesome blues

[Verse 1]
Born with the moon in Cancer
Choose her a name she will answer to
Call her green and the winters cannot fade her
Call her green for the children who've made her
Little green, be a gypsy dancer

[Verse 2]
He went to California
Hearing that everything's warmer there
So you write him a letter and say "Her eyes are blue"
He sends you a poem and she's lost to you
Little green, he's a non-conformer

[Chorus]
Just a little green
Like the color when the spring is born
There'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
Just a little green
Like the nights when the Northern lights perform
There'll be icicles and birthday clothes
And sometimes there'll be sorrow

[Verse 3]
Child with a child pretending
Weary of lies you are sending home
So you sign all the papers in the family name
You're sad and you're sorry but you're not ashamed
Little green, have a happy ending

[Chorus]
Just a little green
Like the color when the spring is born
There'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
Just a little green
Like the nights when the Northern lights perform
There'll be icicles and birthday clothes
And sometimes there'll be sorrow

[Verse 1]
The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here, Carey
But it's really not my home
My fingernails are filthy
I got beach tar on my feet
And I miss my clean white linen
And my fancy French cologne

[Chorus]
Oh, Carey, get out your cane
And I'll put on some silver
Oh, you're a mean old Daddy
But I like you fine

[Verse 2]
Come on down to the Mermaid Café
And I will buy you a bottle of wine
And we'll laugh and toast to nothing
And smash our empty glasses down
Let's have a round for these freaks and these soldiers
A round for these friends of mine
Let's have another round for the bright red devil
Who keeps me in this tourist town

[Chorus]
Come on, Carey, get out your cane
I'll put on some silver
Oh, you're a mean old Daddy
But I like you
I like you, I like you, I like you

[Verse 3]
Maybe I'll go to Amsterdam
Or maybe I'll go to Rome
And rent me a grand piano
And put some flowers 'round my room
But let's not talk about fare-thee-wells now
The night is a starry dome
And they're playin' that scratchy rock and roll
Beneath the Matala Moon

[Chorus]
Come on, Carey, get out your cane
And I'll put on some silver
You're a mean old Daddy
But I like you

[Verse 4]
The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here
But it's really not my home
Maybe it's been too long a time
Since I was scramblin' down in the street
Now they got me used to that clean white linen
And that fancy French cologne

[Chorus]
Oh, Carey, get out your cane
I'll put on my finest silver
We'll go to the Mermaid Café
Have fun tonight
I said, oh, you're a mean old Daddy
But you're out of sight

[Hook]
Breathe it in, breathe it out
Breathe it in, breathe it out
Breathe it in, breathe it out
Breathe it in, breathe it out

[Verse 1]
We smoke good good, you smoke sour
You got lights out, well we got power
Ask your girlfriend, she knows how I
Blew about a zip in my Eddie Bauer
I like fist fights, you need two Glocks
You rock bullshit, while we knock 2Pac
This that high five, yep that fire
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah and I'm gon' die high
Itchy ga ga, you got bush
We got Obama, and we blow kush
AK-47, not that train wreck
We blow bubble kush, while you smoke bullshit
Ask my nephews, up in the yay yay
If it ain't the Cali then it must the hay hay
This your highlight, so get your shit right
And this that real talk, so get that shit right

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Your kids and your mama, they say that they love me
Cause I am the big dog, and you just a puppy
I got big game, you got nada
You like white girls, so you sniff powder
Weigh that bag light, and play that flash light
This your last night, now get my cash right
I am King Kong, you just a baby cub
I got long dong, and you got baby nuts
Smoke with Snoop Dogg, I don't think so
You got outdoor, I like indo
I am legendary, you are temporary
You smoke stress for less, we smoke blueberry
You got the woo wop sack, so don't start that
Why you pop that, young nigga you ain't got that
If you need that, turn on your headlights
Cause I got that shit to get your head right
Now, smell the smiso, I got diesel
Spread the weed smur', I'm high as a beezurd'
Relax and kick back as D.O.D. did
Now hit that, lit that, and bring that shit back

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
She likes Lebron, he likes Kobe
Well I like Baron Davis, cause that's my homie
L.A. unified, add that up low
Not what you smoke, cause you smoke bunk dope
How many T signs, must I relate back
If you ain't got kush, then please don't say that
We get down here, your weed got brown hair
And that's the kind of weed that we don't smoke round here
See, you smoke red hair, we smoke that there
You got whack shit, and we got cat piss
We like swisher sweets, you like back woods
Your weed got seeds, and you think that's good?
Boy you so lost, I am so boss
I got Q.P.'s, to me that's no cost
D.O. double G, L.B.Cizzne'
I guess this will be the death of me
And if it do so, then let my lungs lay
Cause I'm in heaven blowing seven's of O.G

[Hook]

[Verse]
As I bug out and absorb this energy
Refer to my memories, the scenes of lines and rhymes
To put together for these times
Right of the top like suicide jumpers landed on your block
Ahhh... and do pauses like that and do ad-libs to stretch
To prefer that I'm the bestest more like a suggestion
But maybe it's the truth... still falling of the roof
Thought I was dead but didn't hit the ground
Call the police and hit the pound
It's not 911 on your dial-tone son
It's a write around with a smile infront
See I do it like my flow when I was in '92 when I was in school
When I was rapping like Ghostface Killah with a higher baritone
With a ghost chain wallet and a megaphone zone
It can't nobody stop when the dreads grown long
So I'mma keep it Marley and never sip barely
The beer be the poison the food and the liquor
And you watch study the moves of the niggas
From the back with the jungles on the tack
With the mac tucked in with a strap bring it back
See I do it but I feel when it's done and then... you run
See I messed that up there but then the best up here
Tryin do that less up fear
And say, uh, moving like a movement do
You and you, me and him, is me and him 2 and 2
4 and 4 math don’t work and the bath don't work so I wash up in the shower for an hour
But the rain storm brain form many lines many times
Any rhymes that I kick or I commit like a murderer
Service ya hit ya like a burglar
Cat when I'm sneaking through the back with ya purse
That's a man with lady bag maybe drag maybe fag
But more no less homo no zone goals deeper than mine when
I'm in time to climb to commit crimes
Every time I rhyme
The new york flow was kickin it
Chi town a second it so I'm like President Obama
When I'm ripping it maybe a terrorist maybe embarasses us
But never scareness us and everthing impareness
A pair of us is more, and better, and can’t no body stop, when I score
A sweater like a booster when I'm jumping
Got my polo on strong
And call me what I am like Nas, I'mma a don
So word to the homie in the hero never zero
And I move and I disappear
Represented like Shapiro in court
You still might lose
I get punshed but I still don't bruise
Fly like that cat semi-automatic
Tac the raps I give daps to everybody, back in the day
But there's more the o.k when I'm flowing it
Everybody tryna rock but I'm Chi-ca-goin in
Shout to Common and Kanye West 2 times 2 rhymes
Funk Master Flex and 2 blessingness and I'm still Ramadan
My momma blind and everyone is dropping bombs
Booom and I still do it like nuclear warheads fore-heads is full of these lyrics
And spirits is spirtual and can nobody stop the mathe of the attack
When the rap is so lyrical and then I bless up and yes up
And when I come through up you better put your vest up
Cuz chest shots ain't coming more like for the don
And I'm rapping like I'm going home like flowing on beats
And broken bones clits as I stick to your football track at attacking the rap pack
At exactment and can nobody stack to this
You can't stack up and back up
Rest in peace to my brother Esco as well as Stack Bundles
Far rock away king man we love you
See it's something sinister and something so delivering
When I be kicking and spitting and ripping it
See that's a little Laissez-faire like I don't care
But I still rock like I'm the player of the year
So I shout to the best and I move you around like the nets to Brooklyn
Shooking and can't no body stop me can't take 'em where I took it
And if you want more then just push it and i'll be there
Rocking kicking and hitting and spitting and ripping it down
And doing things and I might give you a pound
But if the phone don't ring don't be mad
Homie just be sad
Cuz you missing out
I'm giving out more knowledge
To drop it, it's like school and a college
And a university it's like two of me inside of this
And rhyming with rhyming wits tryning dropping a dime in this
With a diamond glits rain black hammer keep it rolling
Around gold rolex and don't stama with the froid gased up and the Lamborghini too
I'mma ride around stunning on you and your crew
So I bless you to do something
Never stepping for test that I might have to direct you cousin
An' best beleive we had fun from all the top shouts to CL Smooth and the homie Pete Rock

[Verse 2]
I was just warming up too it's like
The damager rolling in the Dodge Challenger
Pause he trackin' that, stamina and everything is bandaged up
Bandager
And hit you like damager get it all on camera
You Worldstarhiphop-ing it pause and can't no-body
Stop when I evolve and I hit with you log from the forest I chopped down
You catch me on the blog me and funk master flex
And in flex we trust every body bless up yup
(speaking)
I mean you know I love you
And, And I know you love me so..
I just, I don’t see how you could let go so easily
Cause I refuse..

[Verse 1]
Tell me why it don’t feel like we in love anymore
I can’t explain how we got here cause I’m not sure
Did somebody close the door?
I might’ve said some things I didn’t mean and
You probably did some crazy things to me but so what..
That’s just us
That ain’t a good enough reason to give it up

[Hook]
I can’t, I won’t.. fall out of love. I ain’t givin up
No chance, No way
I refuse
I’m never letting go
I’ll never grow old
So if you ask if it’s over baby, I refuse

[Verse 2]
Trying to figure out why we don’t make time anymore
And I hope it ain’t no one else cause we don’t touch anymore
Well at least not like before
I know you get so sick and tired of me and...
But then again you make me wanna leave but so what
That’s just us
Still ain’t no reason to give it up

[Hook]
I can’t, I won’t.. fall out of love. I ain’t givin up
No chance, No way
I refuse
I’m never letting go
I’ll never grow old
So if you ask if it’s over baby, I refuse

[Bridge]
I’m gonna fight. I put that on my life
If it don’t work out I can’t say I didn’t try
It won’t be easy, but if you wit me… I promise we gon make it to the other side
We don’ put too much into this, to throw it all away
Girl lets do whatever
Swear it’s gon’ get better
Got’s to find a way
Cause baby I cain't

[Hook]
I can’t, I won’t.. fall out of love. I ain’t givin up
No chance (no chance), No way. (no way)
I refuse. (I refuse to give my love away)
I’m never letting go
I’ll never grow old
So if you ask if it’s over baby, I refuse

It don been to long. We don been together
Thought that we were strong
Could make it through the weather
Rain & Snow gon’ fall
Your love I won’t lose
She want me to give it up
I refuse

[Intro]

[Verse]
Motherfucker it's, W - I
Act up, knuckles'll fly
Swing somethin' that'll bubble your eye
I've been trouble since the day I was born
A couple mix-ups
So I switched up, made it a song
Put your fists up, say to the song
You know the style, get wild
Like a child I was raised in the corn...nigga
And everybody wanna face-off, until they face off
I'm like a jet when I take off
I'm the one the grip the beat, youngin'
No bullshit, I spit the heat, youngin'
Hit the streets, youngin'
You'll hear my name ring bells
At your face, I aim these shells
Young Wiz,"Hey pimpin"
Prince of the city of steel ain't trippin'
Pricks try to claim to be real, straight simpin'
Y'all niggas ain't listenin'
Hold up! Who you...
Know realer? Flow iller?
Move with a team of goons and go-rillas
Bruise all the crews that choose they don't feel us
Dudes probably thought I'd lose...NO, NIGGA!
Go figga, man I'm playin' to win
If a nigga act up, then I'm layin' him in
You can see a little change from the way that it's been
Said it before, I'll say it again..
Motherfucker it's W, I (dot) Z (dot), playa!
Cowards all stuck, I'm up at the top layer
Half of y'all suck, it's nothin' to drop haters
Stackin' all bucks, man fuck it it's not fa-ir
Cause my team keep winnin', keep women
Keep coming up with amounts of dollars, and keep spendin' em
From the home where the hammers' shootin'
Cats all day, hand-in-hand we're moving
They can't swing like a fan was movin'
Get chopped up like a jam in Houston
It's young Wiz, huh? Steel City, yeah!
Pittsburgh-fitted low, I'm the rookie of the year
Yeah! And I rock and roll
'Till the kid rock Rollies, and my pockets swole
Getting paid's not optional
I tell chicks, C.D.C. - Cash Daddy's Checks and roll

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Something for the rag and bone man
Over my dead body
Something big is gonna happen
Over my dead body

[Verse 2]
Someone's son or someone's daughter
Over my dead body
This is how I end up sucked in
Over my dead body

[Chorus]
I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me

[Bridge]
We don't really want a monster taking over
Tiptoe 'round, tie him down
We don't want the loonies taking over
Tiptoe 'round, tie him down

[Chorus]
May pretty horses
Come to you as you sleep
I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me

[Intro]
Dah-dah-la-la, da-da-dada-da-da
Dah-dah-la-la, da-da-dada-da-da
Dah-dah-la

[Verse 1]
Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have-not's
Money, we make it
Before we see it, you take it

[Chorus]
Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life (Yeah)
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't living, this ain't living
No, no baby, this ain't living
No, no, no

[Verse 2]
Inflation, no chance
To increase finance
Bills pile up sky high
Send that boy off to die

[Chorus]
Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life (He-ey-ey)
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life

[Ad-libs 1]
Oh, baby

[?]

[Verse 3]
Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is (Oh, honey that)
I can't pay my taxes

[Chorus]
Oh, make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
Yeah, it make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands (Ow!)

[Verse 4]
Crime is (Woo!) increasing
Trigger happy policing
Panic is spreading
God knows where we're heading

[Ad-libs 2]
Oh, baby

[?]

["What's Going On" Reprise]
Mother, mother (Mother, mother)
Everybody thinks we're wrong (Mother)
Who are they to judge us (Mother, mother)
Simply because we wear our hair long (Mother)
Uuuh!
Ah-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Ohh!
Oh, oh my bitch bad, my bitch cold
Young bitch with an old soul
Lesson that she learned cause her momma showed her
Probably should have hit her when her momma(…)
My old bitch she’d look young
It’s my bitch but she look yummy
Your bitch poor but she look fine
My white bitch, my black one
Go change my platinum, my skinny girl look(…)
When I put that face in that(…)
Slow Songs, fuck Songs, my soul songs, my club songs
Rap songs, what’s up songs, ya niggas never gonna touch songs
Bet you better momma never fuck..
You seen (…) addicted to my money and she never go to rehab
It’s full of hundreds if you look up in the bag (look in the bag)
Like that bad, my bitch bad, bad!

[Intro]
War gives value to life by showing it can be taken away
And in a perverted way, those who wage war delude themselves into thinking they create life
Or at least make it meaningful
Thus, using that as a basis for grandiose notions of supremacy
Falsely giving themselves the title of masters of the universe
And gatekeepers of morality

[Verse 1]
Peace trials and living power pleasure over pain
Geiger counters check amounts of radiation in the rain
Biochemical nuke, gas masks and rubber boots
Inhale your last gasp without a Hazmat suit
Terrible, unbearable miracle of the modern scientific
Arms race, chase for the horrific
Manhattan project, man cancelling concept
Catastrophic bomb, a fabric-shattering context
A little boy falling from a metal bird
Followed by a fat man who left behind a leveled earth
Imbalanced challenge to survival of the whole piece
Have seeked to staff the whole planet with their own peeps
A zone beeps of contaminated contents
Atomically activated, saturated beyond its
Limits, to live within its boundaries with conscience
To cancer cells, I'm not totally unresponsive

[Hook]
Cause in the future shock, there where everything's storied
I don't feel like there's anything for me
I hope they put this out
Cause in the future shock, there where everything's storied
I don't feel like there's anything for me
I hope they figure out
This atomic misphilosophy

[Verse 2]
Uninhabitable avenues, third wars in southern latitudes
Mutually assured that it all happens to
International violence leaves us black and blue
Blast us back into the past if attack ensues
A pack-approved tactic fully practiced
On the evil of the axis back in World War Two
The melted lunchbox of a disintegrated girl
Dogs on fire, the mosquitoes, flies and squirrels
Men, women and children have their bones cooked to ash
And their shadows burning to the ground from the flash
And if they didn't pass what's the future, Hibakusha?
You say you need a job, but they won't give it to ya
In the era where they said the greatest evil was that white man
From the reich land, but this was coming from the same people
Who thought that Jim Crow was all 'ight then'
Same thing that kept Colonel Tibbets on his flight plan

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Nuclear stockpile's America's second largest
The world's most destructive and the world's most heartless
Under the auspices that war will be rendered harmless
And everlasting peace will be in reach if we just bomb shit
Technologically fanatic racial socio-
Economic faux-intellectual fucking nonsense
Dripping with political interludes, typical of a system
Stark raving mad and operating unconscious
Now how do we proceed?
Knowing through the man's fatalism
And probably you'll never leave
A disease trying to cure its own symptoms with disease
Creating an epidemic just to see if it can be
Genuine mistrust of everything but us
Based on artificial evidence, but mostly racists at the crux
Let's pray they throw 'em all out
And I hope I don't see you
Through the foggy field of vision in the fall out

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Y'all niggas got problems; what the fuck I got? Burners
What the fuck you saying to a real-ass nigga
Come through the streets, I got my car on ice skates
What the fuck you saying to me dog, I'm mean
Off top, came in, hit him in the spleen
Got a problem with it, chain all clean
Bitches on site, bitch I don't write
Off top, let these niggas know some dog

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
The AK-47 leave a nigga holey
Red sauce on his shirt, bowl of ravioli
I'm making that cheese, bowl of macaroni
I'm a make you my new tenderoni

[Verse 3: Left Brain]
Creep into your crib, I'll kill your daughter and your son
Then I'll hit you up with a fucking water gun
With the Odd Future water gun, it's on the shirt
I'll put you on the shirt, nigga, in the dirt
I ain't ready to lead the rap
Hold up, nigga

[Verse 4: Tyler, the Creator]
Bring it back
Niggas think the AK shit don't split
I don't give a fuck; I fucked my bitch

[Verse 5: Earl Sweatshirt]
In her pussy, what the fuck you looking at
Got a problem nigga, I could show you where we cooking at
Real nigga off top with the spit
I'm a rob til I switch to my man Dom Gen

[Verse 6: Domo Genesis]
You already know Young Doms pop the heater
Come and slam a bitch like a WWE diva
I go H.A.M. on the track, tote the mac
Any nigga talk shit, I'm a smack him with the strap
I been had bitches, been had money
Been had True Religions nigga, ain't a thing funny
So racked up, I could buy the mall
Come through shopping Mr. Big and Mr. Tall

[Verse 7: Tyler, the Creator]
Yellow diamonds on my neck like a taxicab
Bop, bop, bleed like a Maxipad

[Verse 8: Earl Sweatshirt]
Real nigga off the top with it
Come through, my diamonds look like Clicquot in the spot, nigga
Off top with the spit, bitch
I'm in the lobby, what is it? Piff lit
Real nigga off top, rich, bitch
Burner in the back, smack him in his dick

[Verse 9: Domo Genesis]
I be on the block, I be selling crack
I got that spicy-ass money, call it pepper jack
You know Doms is riding with the heater
I come through

[Verse 10: Tyler, the Creator]
I'm getting this green like a rake
I'm sneaky like a snake

[Verse 11: Left Brain]
I'm a hit a lick
I'm a hit a lick on your bitch tonight, nigga
If she don't act right, nigga, I'm a
Hit a lick on that bitch tonight
Nigga, if she don't act right tonight, I'm a hit

[Verse 12: Nakel Smith]
Be the witness, my nigga, I sell dope
I got fresh work, it came off the sailboat
Bitch ass niggas

[Verse 13: Matt]
I'm so icy that I need four wrists
Thirty bitches and my wolves in the forest

[Verse 14: Tyler, the Creator]
I'm big shit, you're poo little
Talking to your bitch, I'm Dr. Dolittle

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I stay fresh everyday, like a model at the Magic show
I'm drinking out the bottle with two models at a fashion show
Four niggas be like Gucci Mane, remember from a long time ago
I smoked so much weed that I don't even have no time no more
I got them stupid bands like five, six, seven, I can't even count no more
No hopping out, no sporting no more, I'm hustling like I'm selling dope
Niggas take me for a joke and shit but I find it hysterical
I'm thirty 

[?] then I was like ten years ago
Ten broads with me, they're fine you see, they know they cover Maybelline
Catch your friend, it ain't a dream, It's Gucci Mane come join my team
Uh oh, uh oh, no I'm not from Orlando
I just got that magic stick, I'm balling like the pros do

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Is it my favor that I save her, independent grind so major
Basketball players is neighbors
Might of paid for it but there's nothing really major
Independent balling like the majors, major
Major, paper, ice game glacier
Getting major paper, I be balling like the majors
Major, basketball players is neighbors
Politicians trade in favors

[Verse 2: Wooh Da Kid]
Wooh Da Kid I do it big, everything is major
Hello to the big leads, goodbye to my haters
You can stack Louie shoes, imma' stack paper
Similar to a fat boy, cause I'm caked up
Wait, stop, baby just relax
You don't need your car keys, my shofer handles that
She's flexing like all this shit, just don't amaze her
Never been a super hero so I cannot save her
Bricksquad records, yeah we get dough
Ink drops on the paper, made that money
Grow
It's feeling like the 90's, I'm getting dough
For Gucci, I burn you and leave you dying slow

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Is it my favor that I save her, independent grind so major
Basketball players is neighbors
Might of paid for it but there's nothing really major
Independent balling like the majors, major
Major, paper, ice game glacier
Getting major paper, I be balling like the majors
Major, basketball players is neighbors
Politicians trade in favors

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
It's a flavor foul, every time I leave my house
Iced out, bling blaw wow, slide you out
And I don't love her, she don't love me, she drives me wild
Chain out, take my car, cause she whining now
It's Gucci time, Bricksquad, yeah my goons allowed
And I'm noxious, I'm crazy, they so thugged out
They got them choppers, them carbons, you riding bitch
I'm getting dressed with Gatorade like I won the pennant
On the pennant for the million, quarter million, half a million
Whole ticket, whole ticket, gotta get it, gotta get it
Like the real niggas did it when they did it, when they did it
When I say that I serve my city like tenants

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Is it my favor that I save her, independent grind so major
Basketball players is neighbors
Might of paid for it but there's nothing really major
Independent balling like the majors, major
Major, paper, ice game glacier
Getting major paper, I be balling like the majors
Major, basketball players is neighbors
Politicians trade in favors

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
You love me like words can't explain
For me to feel the same is all you wanna gain
You never claim that the dollars made me change
But the models giving brain
Guess that could get your brain

Hurt your heart in the worst way
Never shoulda let you fall in the first place
But you've fallen, put your all in
Now you're so high off love you don't wanna get down

Most nights she ain't sleep
Worried where I might or I might not be
Sheesh...! For the life of me
Man what a life I lead

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You kept me on this pedestal
No matter how much I let you down (down, I let you down, down, down)
With all my infidelity
You loved me so incredibly
Inside I'll fall apart
If you ever love someone instead of me (instead of me)
So you deserve a better man (instead of me, instead of me)

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Clock won't stop (tick, tock)
Her love is going, going, going by the minute
Going, going, going, she keep giving

But I know she can't take it
Still her heart I keep breaking
So I'mma let her love go
Cause I don't deserve her love no more

Sad story
She mad for me
And mad at me
Sad that we
Can't exude love
Not a true love
Cause it's all screwed up

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You kept me on this pedestal
No matter how much I let you down (down, I let you down, down, down)
With all my infidelity
You loved me so incredibly
Inside I'll fall apart
If you ever love someone instead of me

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
How do you fix a love undone
How you even know if you're fit to love someone
And when you decide to take that ride
Can you drive from the passengers side
One wheel in the middle
Four hands on it
Two sets of breaks
You decide to slam on it
God damn woman
Where the love go
Whip crash will you get whiplash
Sit back cause you won't get shit back
But think if you tried to get what you just had back
She mad at facts
And you can't be mad at that
You can't be mad at that
(You can't be mad at that)

[Bridge]
Clock won't stop, tick-tock (2x)

[Outro]
You kept me on this pedestal
No matter how much I let you down (I let you down)

[Intro]
My sons, keep them
Please forgive me

[Verse 1]
Whoa, now, I think this woman went and put a hex on me
Whoa, now, why'd I let her go and put that sex on me?
Whoa, now, I probably shouldn't have watched that girl undress for me
The scent of her perfume in the air
Got it feeling different in here, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
She took my breath away
On to some fancy ship
Into another place
Such an expensive trip
But she didn’t make me pay for it with my money

[Chorus]
It’s the sins of my father
He left the debt to his son
To pay the girl who’s a mother
Collector won't let me run, no
But she didn’t make me pay for it with my money
I paid for the sins of my father

[Verse 2]
Whoa, now, she’s speaking in a tongue that sounds new to me
Whoa, now, mama told me what this could do to me
Whoa, now, I wouldn’t fall for something like this, usually
Tell me how could I ever prepare
If my papa never was there?

[Pre-Chorus]
She took my breath away
On to some fancy ship
Into another place
Such an expensive trip
But she didn’t make me pay for it with my money

[Chorus]
It’s the sins of my father
He left the debt to his son
To pay the girl who’s a mother
Collector won't let me run, no
But she didn’t make me pay for it with my money
I paid for the sins of my father

[Bridge]
(Father)
Hurt me, please me, yeah (father)
No, I don’t deserve the debt that came with my birth (father)
No, why have I been pretending this is something that that man come up with?
I’m praying I reverse this curse

[Chorus]
It’s the sins of my father
He left the debt to his son, hey
To pay the girl who’s a mother
Collector won't let me run, no
But she didn’t make me pay for it with my money
I paid for the sins of my father

[Verse 1: Gucci]
Made a promise to my self that I'll be never broke
Counting up all this money but I'm never tired
Three in the morning and I'm still going
Jewelry so cold feel like the wind blowing
Pushing more weight then Arnold Schwarzenegger
Walk-in closet filled with belts and glasses (Gucci!)
Kill ya self my nigga do the world a favor
And I done lost count I got so many haters
Canary watch I swear got yellow fever
Jimmy Choo glasses so its hard to see ya
Put my money on a treadmill, And let it build
Limo tinted SUV I see ya when I see ya

[Hook: Gucci] x2
I'mma gymnast, I'mma gymnast
I'm in the kitchen flippin' chickens I'mma gymnast
I'm in the laboratory now doing chemistry
I can't lie me and Money got a chemistry (Gucci)

[Verse 2: Gucci]
Throw the money in the air like I'm Elway, 50 bells at the house, I'mma balesmen, I got 65 thangs on the Expressway
A couple boxes of mid is what they mail me
I love my plug homie shout out to my esé
I got that gas pack homie you a schwag seller,
I'm in my big dooley Truck, It's a glass house
I'll turn ya sister condo into a trap house
I'm hand to hand with the cookies like a girl scout
Winter time you might catch me in the stretch furr
All black Maybach with the chauffeur
I'mma cooker but yo daddy is a smoker

[Hook: Gucci] x2
I'mma gymnast, I'mma gymnast
I'm in the kitchen flippin' chickens I'mma gymnast
I'm in the laboratory now doing chemistry
I can't lie me and Money got a chemistry (Gucci)

[Verse 3: Gucci]
Dirty money throw that money in the shower
She can't even feel her face cause of the powderOne spot three kitchens is a blow spot
Charge you twenty grand flat for some convo
Keep the j's mile high like the Broncos
Got a nigga bussin' bales in the living room
Left ounce n half on the hard wood
Count a half a million cash in the bedroom
Never let a nigga know were yo stash at
Made 75k playing blackjack
Let a nigga get it back playing Cee-Lo
I'm on my old school shit playing kilo

[Hook: Gucci] x2
I'mma gymnast, I'mma gymnast
I'm in the kitchen flippin' chickens I'mma gymnast
I'm in the laboratory now doing chemistry
I can't lie me and Money got a chemistry (Gucci)

[Verse 1]
I am an American aquarium drinker
I assassin down the avenue
I'm hiding out in the big city blinking
What was I thinking when I let go of you?

[Verse 2]
Let's forget about the tongue-tied lightning
Let's undress just like cross-eyed strangers
This is not a joke, so please stop smiling
What was I thinking when I said it didn't hurt?

[Verse 3]
I want to glide through those brown eyes dreaming
Take it from the inside, baby hold on tight
You were so right when you said I've been drinking
What was I thinking when we said good night?

[Verse 4]
I want to hold you in the Bible-black predawn
You're quite a quiet domino, bury me now
Take off your Band-Aid because I don't believe in touchdowns
What was I thinking when we said hello?

[Verse 5]
I'd always thought that if I held you tightly
You'd always love me like you did back then
Then I fell asleep and the city kept blinking
What was I thinking when I let you back in?

[Refrain]
I am trying to break your heart
I am trying to break your heart
But still,​ I'd be lying if I said it wasn't easy
I am trying to break your heart

[Verse 6]
Disposable Dixie-cup drinking
I assassin down the avenue
I'm hiding out in the big city blinking
What was I thinking when I let go of you?

[Outro]
(... Loves you
I'm the man who loves you)

[Verse 1]
I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back

[Pre-Chorus]
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?

[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent, you're still an innocent

[Verse 2]
Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

[Pre-Chorus]
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32 and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

[Bridge]
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too, ooh
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new, oh

[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32 and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent, you're still an innocent

[Outro]
Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh
It's never too late to get it back

[Verse 1]
In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away

[Chorus]
What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

[Verse 2]
Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come and wash away

[Chorus]
What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

[Bridge]
For what I've done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving

[Chorus]
What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

[Outro]
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
What I've done
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
Forgiving what I've done
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)
(Na-na na na)

[Intro]
Time is runnin', I'm passin', I'm passin' and runnin'
I'm runnin' and passin'
So you all better get right at this time
'Cause there might be no next time, y'all

[Instrumental]

[Intro: Meek Mill]
I'm ready

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Love my team, I'll die for them niggas, ahh (Real rap)
Hating-ass niggas in my circle, had to cut 'em out (Cut 'em)
Gold-digging-ass bitches, fuck 'em then it's fuck em all (Fuck 'em)
Had my niggas locked down, so I'm screaming fuck the law (I'm riding)
Strap on, clip bent, riding in the Cadillac (Caddy)
Jack boys looking at me, and they know I ain't having that (Uh-uh)
Let them niggas pump you up, Like you just had an asthma attack
I'll hit you with that rat-a-tat, change your mind like "Matter fact"
Bow! We just like the Mafia (Mob), body you
Break the code of silence, nigga, we gon' 'Luminati you (Yeah)
Pull up in that black thing, "Phantom of the Opera" (Skrt!)
We be selling fish scales, just to make tilapia (Yeah)
I be up all night, chasing down them Benjamins
You should see this money, all these pretty hoes I'm swimming in
Walking to the stage, singing "Not Afraid" by Eminem
Take me to the boss, bitch, I don't deal with middlemen (Nope, ha!)

[Chorus: Drake & Meek Mill]
I'm about whatever, man, fuck what they talking about
Their opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Awww, and we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night (All night!) whole crew in here
'Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Awww, man, I love my team, man, I love my team (Yeah)
I'll die for them niggas, awww (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
If Omelly tell me, "Fuck her," I'ma fuck her (Fuck her)
And if my nigga like her, swear to God that I won't touch her (Never)
'Cause loyalty is everything, them niggas like my brothers
If you don't see me with them everyday
Most likely I don't trust 'em, so it's fuck 'em
I'm a northsider nigga (North), with a southsider attitude (Southside)
Got the streets already, now I'm coming to take the avenues (Gimme that!)
Broke—them niggas love you
You get money, they get mad at you (Haters)
"Like why Tip ain't sign you yet?"
'Cause I ain't never ask him to (Never)
Haaaa! Just look at my wrist (Bling)
You look like that and I look like this (This)
I'm looking Rozayish and you looking like Chris (Ha!)
Old played-out-ass nigga, hating on me, broke bitch
It's whatever man, fuck what they talking 'bout
Niggas diss me in they raps, see me, try to talk it out (Frauds!)
I just look 'em in they eyes, it ain't shit to talk about
'Cause if we catch 'em without the crowd, we gon' chalk 'em out
Ha!

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talking 'bout
Their opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Awww, and we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it

'Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Man, I love my team, man, I love my team
I'll die for them niggas, awww

[Intro: Project Pat]
Still got that work , Still got that work , Still got it
Still got that work , Still got that work , Still got it

[Hook: Wiz & Pat]
All this money a nigga made ain't change me
No I’m always gon' be the same, some of my niggas
(Still got that work , Still got that work , Still got it
Still got that work , Still got that work , Still got it)
Smokin’ on that Cali strong every time I roll up
Reppin' it everywhere I go, some of my niggas
(Still got that work , Still got that work , Still got it
Still got that work , Still got that work , Still got it)

[Verse: Wiz Khalifa]
All this money a nigga made niggas can't take it
All this money a nigga made and I'm still makin' it
Lot of new niggas comin out and I don’t feel none
Lot of you got fake diamonds on, I'm rockin real ones
Now they get excited when I pull up in that old school blowin that shit up out it
Ya'll talkin', Ive been about it
Now haters forget about it
From serving weed in a alley to smoking weed out in Cali
I swerve and weave in my chally, what's on my feet cost a thouwy
My other car hand made , the manual come in Italian
My nigga , I've been gettin' them benjamins
Shippin' my friends in 'em , we servin' like Wimbledon, you talkin' I'm living it

[Hook]

[Verse: Project Pat]
Project Pata', hustle for the cheddar
And betta, keep it straight hood to the latter
North Memphis Tennessee, that's what I rep(ah)
Where they blow your brains broad day for the cheddah
Pressure , make a broke man get that burna
Slap you in the mouth like Ike and Tina Turner
And take all your bread , middle fingers to the feds
My nigga against the fence and he gon' hustle 'till he dead
Same spot, same mix, same pot, same bricks
In my hood them same junkies looking for they same fix
Tornado swag , blue the coupe, off the roof
Blowing Cali strong , mind blown off the loot

[Hook]

[Hook (Cash Out)]
Cool
36 O's so riding round with that nina
Riding with a ho named Keisha, smoking on Keisha
My diamonds talk for me they say "Hi, can I meet you"
G5, how high in the sky, ho I can't see you
Got a condo on my wrist girl, I'm cashing out
Got a condo around my neck girl, I'm cashing out
36 O's so I'm riding round with that nina
My diamonds talk for me they say "Hi, can I meet you"

[Verse 1 (Cash Out)]
I got Versace all on my back
These hoes all on my back
Plus these plugs all on my back
Cause they know I'm moving that pack
These Louies all in my face
Four-fifths stay up on my waist
Plus it ain't on me for nothing so please don't make me catch a case
Cause bitch I'm 'bout it
Me walking round with no check on me, psshh
Yeah I doubt it
Your girl ain't finna leave with me, psshh
Yeah I doubt it
And I'm like, what the hell they talking 'bout
And if I got it I bought it, cause boy you know I'm cashing out

[Hook]

[Verse 2 (Ludacris)]
Okay I've got ya whole estate up on my ear
Your life savings on my pinky
And oops I think I spent ya pension plan in Magic City
Got your bonus on my tooth
Your trust fund is in my hemi
And my girl just got her nipple pierced
With your tax return, on her titty
They say Luda, why you gotta write another verse about your cash
Cause I'm rich, bitch
And if you don't like it, kiss my ass
Plus there's too many rappers out here
Who be lyin' about what they have
So they hate a real nigga like me
Who truthfully stuntin' on they ass
Cause I, got the Georgia lottery in my bank account
Your diamonds are foogazi, you should take them out
Check the status of my life as a baller
As my money got bigger, all my chains got smaller
Motherfucker

[Hook]

[Bridge]
There's a thousand ways to meet you now
There's a thousand ways to track you down
Whatever you said﻿ and done
There's a﻿ thousand ways to make it count
There is nothing that can touch me now
You can't even break me down
Every time you think of some
It's all ready been did and done

[Hook]
Can I be your best friend?
Can I make it to the end?
Can you give me some of what
You went and gave them?
Come walk with me
You ain't gotta shake it, just be with me
You ain't gotta throw your hands in the air
Cause tonight we ain't actin' like we don't care
It's cool it takes two,﻿ I'm gonna still fux with you
Almost there

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Tryna feel like what that feels like
When someone makes you feel alright
We can take the same path tonight
For the ride I got plenty of time

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
What doesn't kill us, it makes us stronger
That's why my roads get longer and longer
My tracks are less traveled here to Uganda
Can we touch base just to discuss agenda?

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
There's a dream in my soul
A fire that's deep inside me
There's a me no one knows
Waiting to be set free

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna see that day
I can feel it, I can taste it
Change is coming my way

[Chorus]
I was born to be somebody
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me
I'll light up the sky like lightning
I'm gonna rise above, show 'em what I'm made of
I was born to be somebody, I was born to be
And this world will belong to me

[Verse 2]
This life can kick you around, woah
This world can make you feel small, woah
They will not keep me down, woah
I was born to stand tall

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going all the way
I can feel it, I believe it
I'm here, I'm here to stay

[Chorus]
I was born to be somebody
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me
I'll light up the sky like lighting
I'm gonna rise above, show 'em what I'm made of
I was born to be somebody, I was born to be
And this world will belong to me

[Bridge]
Feel it, believe it
Dream it, be it

[Chorus]
I was born to be somebody
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me
I'll light up the sky like lighting
I'm gonna rise above, show 'em what I'm made of
I was born to be somebody, I was born to be
And this world will belong to me

[Outro]
Oh oh, oh oh

[Intro]
Whoa oh yeah

[Verse 1]
You're the finest girl I've ever seen and I wonder do you notice
That every guy you meet ends up catching feelings for you?
You can have any of 'em, you can take your pick
But you need to check with me, girl I promise, I'm legit
Yes, we be going to the movie in a theatre holding hands
I’ll walk you home from school, I'll walk you to your classes
Playing my 360, yes you'll be my best friend
But most of all baby doll, you'll be my love love love

[Chorus]
You should pick me, so tell me can you dig it?
I'm everything you need girl, so tell me can you dig it?

And I should be your one and only man, you should pick me

[Verse 2]
You're my favourite part of the day and every morning I look forward
To me seeing your face, I just need to see it some more
Baby I'm the kind of guy who can appreciate a girl as amazing as you
So you got to be my baby, yeah
Cause if you feel me, already we chilling at the beach
I'll take you on a cruise, watch the sunset while we eating
You can get anything you want cause I'll be your best friend
But most of all baby doll, you'll be my love love love

[Chorus]
You should pick me, so tell me can you dig it?
I'm everything you need girl, so tell me can you dig it?
I'll always be your number one number one fan, dig that
And I should be your one and only man
You should pick me, tell me can you dig it?
Everything we could be girl, so tell me can you dig it?
I'll always be your number one number one fan, dig that
And I should be your one and only man, you should pick me

[Bridge]
You should pick the guy that makes you happy
Make you fly in style and pick the one that's got swagger
Pick the one that makes you laugh, the one that always got you back
And would rather die than would make you sad
That's why you should pick me, so tell me can you dig it?
I'm everything you need girl, so tell me can you dig it?
I'll always be your number one number one fan, dig that
And I should be your one and only man

[Chorus]
That's why you should pick me, so tell me can you dig it?
I'm everything you need girl, so tell me can you dig it?
I'll always be your number one number one fan, dig that
And I should be your one and only man
You should pick me, tell me can you dig it?
Everything we could be girl, so tell me can you dig it?
I'll always be your number one number one fan, dig that
And I should be your one and only man, you should pick me

Ceiling fans with you on top of me
And the window blinds are filled with rays of sun
And all you secret fantasies thy will be done (done)
And inside of your walls there will dwell a Capricorn
(That will feast your body all night)
If we keep this up then a love child will be born
All because of the greatest

[Chorus]
The greatest you

We have found the greatest chemistry
The greatest touch
The greatest kiss
What came to be is the greatest wish (it's the greatest)

Baby your love stays constantly on my mind
This is the best sex I've ever had

I know twelve ways to make your love come down
And the secret places on you will be found

(That will feast your body all night)
And if we keep this up then a love child will be born
All because of the greatest

Baby your love stays constantly on my mind
The sex so good I've got to break it down

[Intro: Ring announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen
Coming to the ring
At a whopping 273 pounds
Standing at 5'7 3 quarters and a half
Out of Flushing, Queens
It's.....

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Fly in the winter like a flock of birdies, I never rocked a derby
You see the polo, U.S.A. right on the hockey jersey
Every step that I take mimicking no man
Precision flow man, motherfucker get with the program
Compare the lord to no man, moves I never fake em
Aura like Wagyu beef, you just a Steak-Umm
Paired with shiraz for the taste to serve at table side
My lyric through the vocal take my palette on a flavour ride
It's obvious I'm gonna do it, right outta Flushing
Percussion gushing after the session right to the luncheon
On my Scandinavian shit, serve up a puffin
Find a shorty, gargle her mouth and stuff her muffin
Duffin many blunts to the neck, what you expect?
I'm a vet show the respect, same shit your father get
Very humble, Jim Brown, never fumble
Know the purple in season and well then I'll take a bundle
We in the street like a hooker's feet
I'm known for cooking meat, cooking beats
And wildin' like I'm Booker T
Bronsolini walking like a cowboy
Sharp at the feet steel and got the alloy
Straight outta New York the bad liuetenient, Bronsolini
Team leathered down, the angel I like's in the pini
You oughta see me, uptown coppin' the chimi
Puffin the pudo, fuckin' some culo, Bronson the chulo
Jaws of white shark ready for the swimmin'
Haze and linen with razor vision make the blade decision
Peep the beeper, Lonnie do the street procedure
Legendary shit for how my brother heat the beaker
Exquisite beard lined up, that's for the ladies
Plus I'm bout to be in Turkey G'd up riding Mercedes
Know Hugginatti keep the ceaser wavy, Bronsolini with the seasoned gravy
Just add the cheese for flavi
Straight to the table cause it's best when I'm hot
Play me funny kick your nuts until your testicles pop
Exhale the doja, when it's full moon I lose composure
Lesson 1: cuddle your son. Brought to a closure
Dabble in truffles, Sauvignon blanc simmered in mussels
Nothing ever ripped from my neck during a tussle
A bolo young I'm Lecter with the muzzle
Injector of the deck I place the sectors in the puzzle
I'm the boy that looks excited
I'm the boy that's gonna fall apart
Candyfloss, a plot device
I'm the boy that eats his heart out

I know I should be more careful
I know I should watch where I've been
Candyfloss, she's a safe cracker
She kissed me first and then broke in

We slip and slide on the stay-together landmine
I make my mind up to never be myself
And every time I make a rhyme
I live my life for someone else

Oh-whoa-whoa
Oh-whoa-whoa
Oh-whoa-whoa

She's in the kitchen
With bitter diamond drunk
(She's in the way)
I'm on the sofa
(I'm in the way)
Hoping she leaves that punk
'cause

I'm the boy with the poetry power
I'm the boy, smells like flowers
Every time I make a rhyme
I live my life like I wasn't invited

Oh-whoa-whoa

She's in the way
I'm in the way

I'm the boy that looks excited
I'm the boy that's gonna fall apart
Candyfloss, she kissed me first
And I'm the boy, don't get me started

I know I should be more careful
I know I should watch where I've been
Candyfloss, she's a safe cracker
She kissed me first, then broke in

Oh-whoa-whoa

[Verse 1]
All the early Roman Kings in their sharkskin suits
Bowties and buttons, high top boots
Driving the spikes in, blazing the rails
Nailed in their coffins in top hats and tails

[Chorus 1]
Fly away, little bird
Fly away, flap your wings
Fly by night
Like the early Roman kings

[Verse 2]
All the early Roman Kings in the early, early morn’
Coming down the mountain, distributing the corn
Speeding through the forest, racing down the track
You try to get away, they drag you back

[Chorus 2]
Tomorrow is Friday
We’ll see what it brings
Everybody’s talking
‘Bout the early Roman kings

[Verse 3]
They’re peddlers and they’re meddlers, they buy and they sell
They destroyed your city, they’ll destroy you as well
They’re lecherous and treacherous, hell bent for leather
Each of them bigger than all men put together

[Chorus 3]
Sluggers and muggers
Wearing fancy gold rings
All the women going crazy
For the early Roman kings

[Verse 4]
I'll dress up your wounds with a blood clotted rag
I ain’t afraid to make love to a bitch or a hag
If you see me coming and you’re standing there
Wave your handkerchief in the air

[Chorus 4]
I ain’t dead yet
My bell still rings
I keep my fingers crossed
Like the early Roman kings

[Verse 5]
I'll strip you of life, strip you of breath
Ship you down to the house of death
One day you will ask for me
There’ll be no one else that you’ll want to see

[Chorus 5]
Bring down my fiddle
Tune up my strings
Gonna break it wide open
Like the early Roman kings

[Verse 6]
I was up on black mountain the day Detroit fell
They killed them all off and they sent them to hell
Ding Dong Daddy, you’re coming up short
Gonna put you on trial in a Sicilian court

[Chorus 6]
I’ve had my fun
I’ve had my flings
Gonna shake ‘em all down
Like the early Roman kings

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I hate when it rains... all I really do is sit on my ass
Thinking of the next scheme just to double my cash
If I ain't thinkin about cash, nigga I'm thinking bout' life
Making a change, no winners do the same shit twice
Rain dayz and the pain, just rest on my veins
Can't go to sleep, somebodys looking through my window pain
Mane, I swear I'm going catch em' but maybe I'm trippin like scarface
My minds playing tricks on me homie, will it
Rain, shit! I just wanna know where do' is
Is he safe, warm and out the elements, mommy let him come home
I think a niggas done doing wrong I get scared of the days when the soul will be gone
It's spoken word but thoughts never been spittin in vein
Seems like the only way to sunshine is through the hard rain
I need to find a path leading the change, ask God if he feels my pain
And please would you stop the Rain...

[Hook: repeats]
Please Stop The Rain
Ask God If He Feels My Pain

[Verse 2]
Grey clouds started forming
Gathered around my father's homecoming
When his soul, on this earth, was summoned
I remember a white church
And my lips had a salty taste
From the tears runnin' down my face
Can't erase the hurt
Watchin' my father's body lowered in dirt
While my uncle and cousin passed too
What's life worth?
If it rained
Sometimes I would just sit there and cry
At recess, didn't wanna play, I just wished I would die
Things
Rushed through my head back when I was eleven
Praying and hoping that my dad had made it to heaven
It was hard being the youngest
And no one helped me
Everybody seemed happy
And no one felt me
But regardless of the fact
I did the best that I can
Making the transition from boy
Straight to a grown man
But understand, I felt the shame
And I feel the same, that God just needs...
To stop the rain

[Hook:]
Please Stop The Rain
Ask God If He Can Feel My Pain

[Verse 3]
Back then I was young
Now I'm grown here to fend on my own
I'm speaking and bringing the truth through this lyrical poem
And it's hard cause these niggas can't see...
Open up your eyes you can recognize me
I felt the rain like every other nigga did
Nigga always slip and stand up so I slid
It's part of the life
While every thing seems trife
And everything wrong very well may be right
It's just confusing and some people can't handle
There mind breaks down, and their hearts start to dismantel
But I'm that boy to use the hand of evil dreams
God realize that this life is way more then it seems
It's just somthin you learn on the daily as your mind matures
Can't ruin the life with a heart so pure
And since I realize that things won't change
God you can keep with the same
Cause I'm a just deal with the rain!

[Hook:]
I'm a Deal With The Rain
Tell God Just To Keep It The Same

Rollin' down Fairfax
Just left the Nico, bust a left turn on Pico
Gotta see the Bishop, he got me some gator shoes
I'm rollin' to Hollywood, I'm doing the house of blues
About 9 o clock stop by the record shop
And get that new Snoop Dogg, now we bouncing ball
Life is a mystery, my life is like history
Stop by my dispensary
Give me some kush and pusha
Put it in the trunk, smelling like some skunk
But it's all legal in LA
Everybody taking a hit from the politicians
Athletes and even the teachers
My dentist even hit it, Dr Beecher
He say "Snoop Dogg I really wanna meet ya"
Yeah, I love showing you now
First things first, my nig' you better know where you at
You in...

Wrist In Hand
This Ain't No Little Man
Just Presidential Rolex And
This Is My Biggest sin
Jealously attracting them
Trying My Best To Do Less
Trying my best But, Im Such To A Greater Extent
My Phone Rings, A Block Call, 2 A.M
Who could it be?
Not moms, she with auntie
Tropezing, smiling saying her son paid it
Like If One Make It
We All Made It

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Tyga]

[Verse 1]
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away
I wanna stop at Carbondale and keep on going
That Duquesne train gon' ride me night and day

[Chorus 1]
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp
But I ain't neither one
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Sounding like it's on a final run

[Verse 2]
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like she never blowed before
Blue light blinking, red light glowing
Blowing like she's at my chamber door

[Chorus 1]
You smiling through the fence at me
Just like you always smiled before
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more

[Verse 3]
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going
You're like a time bomb in my heart

[Chorus 1]
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling
Must be the mother of our Lord
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like my woman's on board

[Verse 4]
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away
You old rascal, I know exactly where you're going
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day

[Chorus 4]
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead

[Verse 5]
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Blowing through another no good town
The lights on my native land are glowing
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round

[Chorus 5]
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like she's blowing right on time

[Verse 1]
I'm searching for phrases to sing your praises
I need to tell someone
It's soon after midnight
And my day has just begun

[Verse 2]
A gal named Honey took my money
She was passing by
It's soon after midnight
And the moon is in my eye

[Verse 3]
My heart is cheerful, it's never fearful
I've been down on the killing floors
I'm in no great hurry, I'm not afraid of your fury
I've faced stronger walls than yours

[Verse 4]
Charlotte's a harlot, dresses in scarlet
Mary dresses in green
It's soon after midnight
And I've got a date with the fairy queen

[Verse 5]
They chirp and they chatter, what does it matter?
They're lying there dying in their blood
Two-timing Slim, who's ever heard of him?
I'll drag his corpse through the mud

[Verse 6]
It's now or never, more than ever
When I met you I didn't think you would do
It's soon after midnight
And I don't want nobody but you

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna walk across the desert 'til I'm in my right mind
I won't even think about what I left behind
Nothing back there anyway that I can call my own
Go back home, leave me alone

[Chorus]
It's a long road
It's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you
You'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 2]
Ever since the British burned the White House down
There's a bleeding wound in the heart of town
I saw you drinking from an empty cup
I saw you buried and I saw you dug up

[Chorus]
It's a long road
It's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you
You'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 3]
Look down, angel from the skies
Help my weary soul to rise
I kissed her cheek, I dragged your plow
You broke my heart, I was your friend 'til now

[Chorus]
It's a long road
It's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you
You'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 4]
In the courtyard of the golden sun
You stand and fight or you break and run
You went and lost your lovely head
For a drink of wine and a crust of bread

[Chorus]
It's a long road
It's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you
You'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 5]
We looted and we plundered on distant shores
Why is my share not equal to yours?
Your father left you, your mother too
Even death has washed its hands of you

[Chorus]
It's a long road
It's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you
You'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 6]
This is hard country to stay alive in
Blades are everywhere and they're breaking my skin
I'm armed to the hilt and I'm struggling hard
You won't get out of here unscarred

[Chorus]
It's a long road
It's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you
You'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 7]
You got too many lovers waiting at the wall
If I had a thousand tongues, I couldn't count them all
Yesterday I could've thrown them all in the sea
Today even one may be too much for me

[Chorus]
It's a long road
It's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you
You'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 8]
Can't walk them, baby, you could do no wrong
Put your arms around me, where they belong
I won't take you on a roller-coaster ride
Lay my hands all over you, tie you to my side

[Chorus]
It's a long road
It's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you
You'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 9]
I've got a heavy stacked woman with a smile on her face
And she has crowned my soul with grace
I'm still hurting from an arrow that pierced my chest
I'm gonna have to take my head and bury it between your breasts

[Chorus]
It's a long road
It's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you
You'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 10]
Been dark all night but now it's dawn
The moving finger is moving on
You can guard me while I sleep
Kiss away the tears I weep

[Chorus]
It's a long road
It's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you
You'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 11]
I love women and she loves men
We've been to the west and we going back again
I heard a voice at the dusk of day
Saying, "Be gentle brother, be gentle and pray."

[Chorus]
It's a long road
It's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you
You'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 1]
It's been such a long, long time
Since we loved each other, when our hearts were true
One time, for one brief day, I was the man for you
Last night I heard you talking in your sleep
Saying things you shouldn't say, oh baby
You just may have to go to jail someday

[Verse 2]
Is there a place we can go, is there anybody we can see?
Maybe it's the same for you as it is for me
I ain't seen my family in twenty years
That ain't easy to understand, they may be dead by now
I lost track of 'em after they lost their land

[Verse 3]
Shake it up, baby, twist and shout
You know what it's all about
What are you doing out there in the sun anyway?
Don't you know, the sun can burn your brains right out

[Verse 4]
My enemy crashed into the dust
Stopped dead in his tracks and he lost his lust
He was run down hard and he broke apart
He died in shame, he had an iron heart

[Verse 5]
I wear dark glasses to cover my eyes
There are secrets in 'em that I can't disguise
Come back, baby
If I hurt your feelings, I apologize

[Verse 6]
Two trains running side by side
Forty miles wide, down the eastern line
You don't have to go
I just came to you because you're a friend of mine

[Verse 7]
I think that when my back was turned
The whole world behind me burned
It's been a while
Since we walked down that long, long aisle

[Verse 8]
We cried on a cold and frosty morn
We cried because our souls were torn
So much for tears
So much for these long and wasted years

[Verse 1]
Well I'm grinding my life out, steady and sure
Nothing more wretched than what I must endure
I'm drenched in the light that shines from the sun
I could stone you to death for the wrongs that you done

[Chorus 1]
Sooner or later, you make a mistake
I'll put you in a chain that you never will break
Legs and arms and body and bone
I pay in blood, but not my own

[Verse 2]
Night after night, day after day
They strip your useless hopes away
The more I take the more I give
The more I die the more I live

[Chorus 2]
I got something in my pocket make your eyeballs swim
I got dogs could tear you limb from limb
I'm circling around the Southern Zone
I pay in blood, but not my own

[Verse 3]
Low cards are what I've got
But I'll play this hand whether I like it or not
I'm sworn to uphold the laws of God
You could put me out in front of a firing squad

[Chorus 3]
I've been out and around with the rowdy men
Just like you, my handsome friend
My head's so hard, must be made of stone
I pay in blood, but not my own

[Verse 4]
Another politician pumping out the piss
Another ragged beggar blowin' you a kiss
You got the same eyes that your mother does
If only you could prove who your father was

[Chorus 4]
Someone must have slipped a drug in your wine
You gulped it down and you cross the line
Man can't live by bread alone
I pay in blood, but not my own

[Verse 5]
How I made it back home, nobody knows
Or how I survived so many blows
I've been through hell, what good did it do?
You bastard! I'm suppose to respect you?

[Chorus 5]
I'll give you justice, I'll fatten your purse
Show me your moral virtues first
Hear me holler and hear me moan
I pay in blood but not my own

[Verse 6]
You bit your lover in the bed
Come here, I'll break your lousy head
Our nation must be saved and freed
You've been accused of murder, how do you plead?

[Chorus 6]
This is how I spend my days
I came to bury, not to praise
I'll drink my fill and sleep alone
I pay in blood, but not my own

[Verse 1]
In Scarlet Town, where I was born
There’s ivy leaf and silver thorn
The streets have names that you can’t pronounce
Gold is down to a quarter of an ounce
The music starts and the people sway
Everybody says, “Are you going my way?"
Uncle Tom still working' for Uncle Bill
Scarlet Town is under the hill

[Verse 2]
Scarlet Town in the month of May
Sweet William Holme on his deathbed lay
Mistress Mary by the side of the bed
Kissing' his face and putting' prayers on his head
So brave and true, so gentle is he
I’ll weep for him as he would weep for me
Little Boy Blue come blow your horn
In Scarlet Town, where I was born

[Verse 3]
Scarlet Town, in the hot noon hours
There’s palm-leaf shadows and scattered flowers
Beggars crouching at the gate
Help comes, but it comes too late
By marble slabs and in fields of stone
You make your humble wishes known
I touched the garment, but the hem was torn
In Scarlet Town, where I was born

[Verse 4]
In Scarlet Town, the end is near
The Seven Wonders of the World are here
The evil and the good living' side by side
All human forms seem glorified
Put your heart on a platter and see who will bite
See who will hold you and kiss you good night
There’s walnut groves and maplewood
In Scarlet Town crying' won’t do no good

[Verse 5]
In Scarlet Town, you fight your father’s foes
Up on the hill, a chilly wind blows
You fight ‘em on high and you fight 'em down in
You fight 'em with whiskey, morphine and gin
You’ve got legs that can drive men mad
A lot of things we didn’t do that I wish we had
In Scarlet Town, the sky is clear
You’ll wish to God that you stayed right here

[Verse 6]
Set ‘em Joe, play “Walking the Floor"
Play it for my flat-chested junkie whore
I’m staying up late, I’m making amends
While we smile, all heaven descends
If love is a sin, then beauty is a crime
All things are beautiful in their time
The black and the white, the yellow and the brown
It’s all right there in front of you in Scarlet Town

[Verse 1]
It was late last night when the boss came home
To a deserted mansion and a desolate throne
Servant said: “Boss, the lady’s gone
She left this morning just ‘fore dawn.”

[Verse 2]
“You got something to tell me, tell it to me, man
Come to the point as straight as you can”
“Old Henry Lee, chief of the clan
Came riding through the woods and took her by the hand”

[Verse 3]
The boss he lay back flat on his bed
He cursed the heat and he clutched his head
He pondered the future of his fate
To wait another day would be far too late

[Verse 4]
“Go fetch me my coat and my tie
And the cheapest labour that money can buy
Saddle me up my buckskin mare
If you see me go by, put up a prayer”

[Verse 5]
Well, they rode all night, and they rode all day
Eastward, long down the broad highway
His spirit was tired and his vision was bent
His men deserted him and onward he went

[Verse 6]
He came to a place where the light was dull
His forehead pounding in his skull
Heavy heart was racked with pain
Insomnia raging in his brain

[Verse 7]
Well, he threw down his helmet and his cross-handled sword
He renounced his faith, he denied his lord
Crawled on his belly, put his ear to the wall
One way or another put an end to it all

[Verse 8]
He leaned down, cut the electric wire
Stared into the flames and he snorted the fire
Peered through the darkness, caught a glimpse of the two
It was hard to tell for certain who was who

[Verse 9]
He lowered himself down on a golden chain
His nerves were quaking in every vein
His knuckles were bloody, he sucked in the air
He ran his fingers through his greasy hair

[Verse 10]
They looked at each other and their glasses clinked
One single unit, inseparably linked
“Got a strange premonition there’s a man close by”
“Don’t worry about him, he wouldn’t harm a fly”

[Verse 11]
From behind the curtain, the boss he crossed the floor
He moved his feet and he bolted the door
Shadows hiding the lines in his face
With all the nobility of an ancient race

[Verse 12]
She turned, she was startled with a look of surprise
With a hatred that could hit the skies
“You’re a reckless fool, I could see it in your eyes
To come this way was by no means wise”

[Verse 13]
“Get up, stand up, you greedy-lipped wench
And cover your face or suffer the consequence
You are making my heart feel sick
Put your clothes back on, double-quick”

[Verse 14]
“Silly boy, you think me a saint
I’ll listen no more to your words of complaint
You’ve given me nothing but the sweetest lies
Now hold your tongue and feed your eyes”

[Verse 15]
“I’d have given you the stars and the planets, too
But what good would these things do you?
Bow the heart if not the knee
Or never again this world you’ll see”

[Verse 16]
“Oh, please let not your heart be cold
This man is dearer to me than gold”
“Oh, my dear, you must be blind
He’s a gutless ape with a worthless mind”

[Verse 17]
“You’ve had your way too long with me
Now it’s me who’ll determine how things shall be”
“Try to escape,” he cussed and cursed
‘You’ll have to try to get past me first”

[Verse 18]
“Do not let your passion rule
You think my heart the heart of a fool
And you, sir, you can not deny
You made a monkey of me, what and for why?”

[Verse 19]
“I’ll have no more of this insulting chat
The devil can have you, I’ll see to that
Look sharp or step aside
Or in the cradle you’ll wish you’d died”

[Verse 20]
The gun went boom and the shot rang clear
First bullet grazed his ear
Second ball went right straight in
And he bent in the middle like a twisted pin

[Verse 21]
He crawled to the corner and he lowered his head
He gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed
It would take more than needle and thread
Bleeding from the mouth, he’s as good as dead

[Verse 22]
“You shot my husband down, you fiend”
“Husband? What husband? What the hell do you mean?
He was a man of strife, a man of sin
I cut him down and threw him to the wind”

[Verse 23]
This she said with angry breath
“You too shall meet the lord of death
It was I who brought your soul to life”
Then she raised her robe and she drew out a knife

[Verse 24]
His face was hard and caked with sweat
His arms ached and his hands were wet
“You’re a murderous queen and a bloody wife
If you don’t mind, I’ll have the knife”

[Verse 25]
“We’re two of a kind and our blood runs hot
But we’re no way similar in body or thought
All husbands are good men, as all wives know”
Then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow

[Verse 26]
His knees went limp and he reached for the door
His tomb was sealed, he slid to the floor
He whispered in her ear: “This is all your fault
My fighting days have come to a halt”

[Verse 27]
She touched his lips and kissed his cheek
He tried to speak but his breath was weak
“You died for me, now I’ll die for you”
She put the blade to her heart and she ran it through

[Verse 28]
All three lovers together in a heap
Thrown into the grave, forever to sleep
Funeral torches blazed away
Through the towns and the villages all night and all day

[Verse 1]
The pale moon rose in its glory
Out o'er the Western town
She told a sad, sad story
Of the great ship that went down

[Verse 2]
T'was the fourteenth day of April
Over the waves she rode
Sailing into tomorrow
To a gilded age foretold

[Verse 3]
The night was black with starlight
The seas were sharp and clear
Moving through the shadows
The promised hour was near

[Verse 4]
Lights were holding steady
Gliding over the foam
All the lords and ladies
Heading for their eternal home

[Verse 5]
The chandeliers were swaying
From the balustrades above
The orchestra was playing
Songs of faded love

[Verse 6]
The watchman, he lay dreaming
As the ballroom dancers twirled
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the underworld

[Verse 7]
Leo took his sketchbook
He was often so inclined
He closed his eyes and painted
The scenery in his mind

[Verse 8]
Cupid struck his bosom
And broke it with a snap
The closest woman to him
He fell into her lap

[Verse 9]
He heard a loud commotion
Something sounded wrong
His inner spirit was saying
That he couldn't stand here long

[Verse 10]
He staggered to the quarterdeck
No time now to sleep
Water on the quarterdeck
Already three foot deep

[Verse 11]
Smokestack was leaning sideways
Heavy feet began to pound
He walked into the whirlwind
Sky splitting all around

[Verse 12]
The ship was going under
The universe had opened wide
The roll was called up yonder
The angels turned aside

[Verse 13]
Lights down in the hallway
Flickering dim and dull
Dead bodies already floating
In the double bottom hull

[Verse 14]
The engines then exploded
Propellers they failed to start
The boilers overloaded
The ship's bow split apart

[Verse 15]
Passengers were flying
Backward, forward, far and fast
They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled
Each one more weary than the last

[Verse 16]
The veil was torn asunder
'Tween the hours of twelve and one
No change, no sudden wonder
Could undo what had been done

[Verse 17]
The watchman lay there dreaming
At forty-five degrees
He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking
Dropping to her knees

[Verse 18]
Wellington he was sleeping
His bed began to slide
His valiant heart was beating
He pushed the tables aside

[Verse 19]
Glass of shattered crystal
Lay scattered roundabout
He strapped on both his pistols
How long could he hold out?

[Verse 20]
His men and his companions
Were nowhere to be seen
In silence there he waited for
Time and space to intervene

[Verse 21]
The passageway was narrow
There was blackness in the air
He saw every kind of sorrow
Heard voices everywhere

[Verse 22]
Alarm-bells were ringing
To hold back the swelling tide
Friends and lovers clinging
To each other side by side

[Verse 23]
Mothers and their daughters
Descending down the stairs
Jumped into the icy waters
Love and pity sent their prayers

[Verse 24]
The rich man, Mister Astor
Kissed his darling wife
He had no way of knowing
Be the last trip of his life

[Verse 25]
Calvin, Blake, and Wilson
Gambled in the dark
Not one of them would ever live to
Tell the tale or disembark

[Verse 26]
Brother rose up 'gainst brother
In every circumstance
They fought and slaughtered each other
In a deadly dance

[Verse 27]
They lowered down the lifeboats
From the sinking wreck
There were traitors, there were turncoats
Broken backs and broken necks

[Verse 28]
The bishop left his cabin
To help all those in need
Turned his eyes up to the heavens
Said, "The poor are yours to feed"

[Verse 29]
Davey the brothel-keeper
Came out dismissed his girls
Saw the water getting deeper
Saw the changing of his world

[Verse 30]
Jim Backus smiled
He never learned to swim
Saw the little crippled child
And he gave his seat to him

[Verse 31]
He saw the starlight shining
Streaming from the East
Death was on the rampage
But his heart was now at peace

[Verse 32]
They battened down the hatches
But the hatches wouldn't hold
They drowned upon the staircase
Of brass and polished gold

[Verse 33]
Leo said to Cleo
I think I'm going mad
But he'd lost his mind already
Whatever mind he had

[Verse 34]
He tried to block the doorway
To save all those from harm
Blood from an open wound
Pouring down his arm

[Verse 35]
Petals fell from flowers
Tell all of them were gone
In the long and dreadful hours
The wizard's curse played on

[Verse 36]
The host was pouring brandy
He was going down slow
He stayed right to the end and he
Was the last to go

[Verse 37]
There were many, many others
Nameless here forever more
They never sailed the ocean
Or left their homes before

[Verse 38]
The watchman, he lay dreaming
The damage had been done
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
And he tried to tell someone

[Verse 39]
The captain, barely breathing
Kneeling at the wheel
Above him and beneath him
Fifty thousand tons of steel

[Verse 40]
He looked over at his compass
And he gazed into its face
Needle pointing downward
He knew he lost the race

[Verse 41]
In the dark illumination
He remembered bygone years
He read the Book of Revelation
And he filled his cup with tears

[Verse 42]
When the Reaper's task had ended
Sixteen hundred had gone to rest
The good, the bad, the rich, the poor
The loveliest and the best

[Verse 43]
They waited at the landing
And they tried to understand
But there is no understanding
For the judgment of God's hand

[Verse 44]
The news came over the wires
And struck with deadly force
The love had lost its fires
All things had run their course

[Verse 45]
The watchman he lay dreaming
Of all the things that can be
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the deep blue sea

[Verse 1]
Doctor, doctor tell me the time of day
Another bottle's empty, another penny spent
He turned around and he slowly walked away
They shot him in the back and down he went

[Chorus]
Shine your light
Movin' on
You burned so bright
Roll on, John

[Verse 2]
From the Liverpool docks to the red-light Hamburg streets
Down in the quarry with the quarrymen
Playing to the big crowds, playing to the cheap seats
Another day in the life on your way to your journey's end

[Chorus]
Shine your light
Movin' on
You burned so bright
Roll on, John

[Verse 3]
Sailin' through the trade winds bound for the South
Rags on your back just like any other slave
They tied your hands and they clamped your mouth
Wasn't no way out of that deep dark cave

[Chorus]
Shine your light
Movin' on
You burned so bright
Roll on, John

[Verse 4]
I heard the news today, oh boy
They hauled your ship up on the shore
Now the city gone dark, there is no more joy
They tore the heart right out and cut him to the core

[Chorus]
Shine your light
Movin' on
You burned so bright
Roll on, John

[Verse 5]
Put on your bags and get 'em packed
Leave right now, you won't be far from wrong
The sooner you go the quicker you'll be back
You've been cooped up on an island far too long

[Chorus]
Shine your light
Movin' on
You burned so bright
Roll on, John

[Verse 6]
Slow down you're moving way too fast
Come together right now over me
Your bones are weary, you're about to breathe your last
Lord, you know how hard that it can be

[Chorus]
Shine your light
Movin' on
You burned so bright
Roll on, John

[Verse 7]
Roll on, John, roll through the rain and snow
Take the right-hand road and go where the buffalo roam
They'll trap you in an ambush before you know
Too late now to sail back home

[Chorus]
Shine your light
Movin' on
You burned so bright
Roll on, John

[Verse 8]
Tyger, tyger burning bright
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
In the forests of the night
Cover 'em over and let him sleep

[Chorus]
Shine your light
Movin' on
You burned so bright
Roll on, John

[Intro]
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart (I'm wide awake)
How did I read the stars so wrong? (I'm wide awake)
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see
Ain't always what it seems (I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I knew then, what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete

[Chorus]
Falling from cloud nine
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine

[Verse 2]
I'm wide awake
Not losing any sleep
I picked up every piece
And landed on my feet (I'm wide awake)
Need nothing to complete myself, no (I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den
I don't have to pretend (And it's too late)
The story's over now, the end

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I knew then, what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete

[Chorus]
Falling from cloud nine (It was out of the blue, I'm)
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)
I'm falling from cloud nine (I'm wide awake)

[Bridge]
Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling (I'm wide awake)
I am trying to hold on (I'm wide awake)
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side (I'm wide awake)
But I'm not blind anymore

[Interlude]
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine (It was out of the blue, I'm)
Crashing from the high
You know, I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)
I'm falling from cloud nine

[Outro]
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

[Verse 1]
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

[Chorus]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

[Bridge]
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Outro]
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
(Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy...

[Verse 1]
So we did it again
Knowing we should quit it, but we simply won't admit it again
Oh it feels good, it's so good, but I won't do it again
It's so dramatic again
After we go at it, we get mad then we go at it again
Oh I love it, then I hate it, she's my favorite

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Again I'm wasting time
I can't help it she's so fine
Oh I like her style
And I love the way she talks and I smile
As much as we may try
Can't quite see eye to eye
So in the meantime, I guess we say bye-bye

[Chorus]
(And again and again and again)
Oh, and then, we do it again
We do it again and we do it again
Oh, and then, we do it again
We want it again, and we want it again

[Verse 2]
So we fake it again
I think we're gonna blow it, and we know it
But she's naked again
We get wasted, then I taste it, then I waste it again
I can't invite her again
'Cause she'll go from a lover to a fighter
And I'll fight her again
So it's over, but I told her to come over

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Again I'm wasting time
But she's always on my mind
I can't let her go
Oh, she's not the best, but she's all that I know
As much as we may try
Can't quite see eye to eye
So in the meantime I guess we say bye-bye

[Chorus]
(And again and again and again)
Oh, and then, we do it again
We do it again and we do it again
Oh, and then, we do it again
We want it again, and we want it again

[Verse 3]
So I've got a new friend
I wish I could forget you
But I miss you, wanna kiss you again
Well, she's like you, but she's not you, gotta find you again
So we remember again
The middle of December and I took you out to dinner again
Oh I love her, it's not over, just another again

[Outro]
(And again and again and again)
Oh, it's another again-
I love her, it's another again...
She's a jar
With a heavy lid
My pop quiz kid
A sleepy kisser
A pretty war
With feelings hid
She begs me not to miss her

She says forever
To light a fuse
We could use
A hand full of wheel
And a day off
On a bruised road
However you might feel
Tonight is real

When I forget how to talk I sing
Won't you please
Bring that flash to shine
And turn my eyes red
Unless they close
When you click
And my face gets sick
Stuck
Like a question unposed
Just climb aboard
The tracks of a train's arm
In my fragile family tree
And watch me floating inches above
The people underneath

Please beware the quiet front yard
I warned you
Before there were water skies
I warned you not to drive
Dry your eyes, you poor devil

Are there really ones like these
The ones I dream
Float like leaves
And freeze to spread skeleton wings
I passed through before I knew you

I believe it's just because
Daddy's payday is not enough
Oh, I believe it's all because
Daddy's payday is not enough

Just climb aboard
The tracks of a train's arm
In my fragile family tree
And watch me floating inches above
The people under me
She's a jar
With a heavy lid
My pop quiz kid
A sleepy kisser
A pretty war
With feelings hid
You know she begs me not to hit her

[Intro: Christina Doman]
Fuck this pussy boy, fuck it! (Fuck it right boy!)

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Lamborghini, you don't even see me
Bad bitch, no bikini taking shots of Henny
Order calamari, say she want that fettucini
5 star bitches, my bitches don't eat at Denny's
Run the city, you runnin' laps trying to get with me
I'm all in her red skin, like I play for Washington
I'm five eight, but six ten, my dick stand like Superman
Shoulder lean that bitch, shoulder lean that bitch
Mills cause I'm hot, trigger finger keep that pussy wet
Bills in my fists, shorty she gon' dance on my dick
Mills cause I'm hot, trigger finger keep that pussy wet
Bills in my fists, shorty she gon' dance on my dick

Do my dance on your chick
Ooh, you know, she love the dick (Fuck it, fuck it right, boy)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
She got her booty cheeks on my Louis sheets
She can do it on a pole, but can she do it on me
Her flexing ass, let me see you flex that ass
I don't call I just text that ass and buy special bags
Python, all gold no ice on
Nothing but shaved pussy in my iPhone
And this right here a no fly zone
And you are not us, so don't try, holm'
I buy cars, I buy homes, my antidote for my catapult
I'm up through there, foreign shoes, these a new pair
Chains on, this two pair, make your girl buy new hair
Wear that pussy out, like new gear, ho

[Chorus: Christina Doman & D.A. Doman]
Do my dance on your dick
Ooh, you know, you love this shit
Do my dance on your dick
Ooh, you know, you love this shit

[Verse 1]
The way things go
You get so low
Struggle to find your skin
Hey ho
Look out below
Your prayers will never be answered again

[Verse 2]
Phones still ring
And singers sing
Speakers are speaking in code
What now
Well anyhow
Our prayers will never be answered again

[Chorus]
You know it's all beginning
To feel like it's ending
No love's as random
As God's love
I can't stand it
I can't stand it

[Verse 3]
The way things get
You get so high
Funny how we make new friends
Oh hey ho
I gotta go
My prayers will never be answered again

[Chorus]
You know it's all beginning
To feel like it's ending
No love's as random
As God's love
I can't stand it
I can't stand it

[Bridge]
Speakers speaking
Speakers speaking
Speaking in code

[Chorus]
You know it's all beginning
To feel like pretending
No love's as random
As my love
I can't stand it
I can't stand it

[Outro]
Your prayers will never be answered again
Your prayers will never be answered again
Your prayers will never be answered again
Your prayers will never be answered again

[Verse 1]
The ashtray says
You were up all night
When you went to bed
With your darkest mind
Your pillow wept
And covered your eyes
And you finally slept
While the sun caught fire
You've changed

[Verse 2]
We fell in love
In the key of C
We walked along
Down by the sea
You followed me down
The neck to D
And fell again
Into the sea
You changed
Oh, you've changed

[Hook]
Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
Something in my veins bloodier than blood

[Verse 3]
The ashtray says
You were up all night
When you went to bed
With your darkest mind
You changed
Oh, you've changed

[Outro]
What you once were isn't what you want to be any more

[Intro: Trey Songz, Jeezy & Both]
Woop, woop, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hail Mary, yeah, hail Mary, ah, hail Mary
It’s Trigga (Ah, ah)
Trig, what’s happenin’ nigga? (Ay)
I got that game, I got that game

My game face on, yeah
I got my game face on, come on (Get that loot, nigga)

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
I got my choppa in my ‘rari, in case I see my enemies
I don’t know what’s gotten into me, tonight I’m on this Hennessy
I won’t usually do the brown but tonight is special
Sam Rothstein, be my Ginger, yeah my special hoe
My 2 door is retarded, I call that bitch special-ed
I don’t even know her name, I just call her special head
Another year, same haters, usual suspects
Worried 'bout another nigga, I swear that shit is suspect
Keyser Soze, sold the yay’ and I got away
Hit the club, enter there fresh, in case I die today
Hail Mary, told her it’s the world, ain’t got shit to lose
’Bout to go long, celebrate, like I’m Victor Cruz

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Jeezy]
Hey girl, you say you like it deep (Hail Mary), hail Mary

Tonight we going long, we be going long (Hail Mary)

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Whatever you want I got it, got a drop-top in my pocket
You pop it you watch it, keep on poppin’ and I’ma drop it
So hard to be alone, any wanna go
But right here at this moment you the one I want to roll so
You got the ball baby, it’s in your hands
I’ma be the coach, I’ma let you know the play
What’s next is, baby you and me exitin’
What now? I’ma get you naked, do a little bit of sexin’, touch down
And once you let me score, I'ma wanna score again
Double O, triple O, baby I’ma play to win
You say the best offense is some good D
Hey girl, I heard you like it deep

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Jeezy]
Hey girl, you say you like it deep (Hail Mary), hail Mary
Hey girl, you know the play (Hail Mary), hail Mary
Tonight we going' long (Yeah), we be goin' long (Oh)
Hey, huddle up, huddle up, hail Mary

Tonight we going long, we be going long (Hail Mary)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi in this mutherfucker, Hail Mary, full of grace
I don't remember her name, but I remember how her pussy tastes
I go long, so long, she love the way that I put it down
Gotcha goin' in circles, all you gotta do is look around
I'm mister right and she miss tonight, pussy so nice gotta kiss it twice
Pussy so tight my tongue get stuck, my tongue get stuck like lickin' ice
Hoes call me QB, I throw that dick too deep
I told her shes the preacher's wife, she said practice what you preach
She said, "Ah me so horny, he love me long time"
I say, "How 'bout 69?" She say, "Numbers don't lie"
I say, "True you ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
And you know they say love is blind, so close your eyes"

[Chorus: Trey Songz & Jeezy]
Hey girl, you say you like it deep (Hail Mary), hail Mary
Hey girl, you know the play (Hail Mary), hail Mary
Tonight we going' long (Yeah), we be goin' long (Oh)
Hey, huddle up, huddle up, hail Mary
Yeah, I ain’t tryna punt, tryna punt (Tryna punt), hail Mary (Come on)
Tonight we going long, we be going long (Hail Mary)

[Verse 1]
Why, I wonder, is my heart full of holes
And the feeling goes but my hair keeps growing

[Chorus]
Will I set the sun on a big-wheeled wagon
Oh I'm bragging
I'm always in love

[Verse 2]
When I let go of your throat-sweet throttle
When I clean the lash of your black-belt model

Will I catch the moon, like a bird in a cage
It's for you I swoon
I'm always in love

[Bridge]
I don't get the connection
This is only a test
I hope I do my best
You know I won't forget

[Verse 3]
When I fold the cold in my jet-lag palm
When I soak so long I forget my mother

[Chorus]
Will I set the sun on a big-wheeled wagon
I'm bragging
I'm always in love

[Outro]
It's a drag I snag
I'm always in love
I'm worried
I'm always in love

I'm worried
I'm worried
I'm worried
I'm always in love

[Verse 1]
We’ll find a way regardless
To make some sense out of this mess
Well, it’s a test, but I believe
A kiss is all we need
All the above for being in love
Shouldn’t that alone be enough
Oh, it’s tough when loves a weed
It grows inside of me

[Chorus]
Nothing’s ever gonna stand in my
Nothing’s ever gonna stand in my
Nothing’s ever gonna stand in my way again

[Verse 2]
Waste the days, waste the nights
Try to downplay being uptight
Oh, you’re right, I believe
A kiss is all we need

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
A watch that ticks is wrapped around my wrist
Oh no
I’m a bomb regardless
Oh, I’m a bomb regardless (x3)
We’ll find a way
We’ll find a way
We’ll find a way

[Chorus]
Nothing’s ever gonna stand in our
Nothing’s ever gonna stand in our
Nothing’s ever gonna stand in our way again

[Verse 1]
There's a whisper
I would like to breathe into your ear
But I'm too scared
To get that close to you right now

[Verse 2]
There are dreams we might have shared
And I still care
And I still love you
But you know how I've been untrue

[Verse 3]
In the beginning
We closed our eyes
Whenever we kissed
We were surprised
To find so much inside

[Verse 1]
How to fight loneliness
Smile all the time
Shine your teeth 'til meaningless
Sharpen them with lies

[Verse 2]
And whatever's going down
Will follow you around
That's how you fight loneliness
You laugh at every joke
Drag your blanket blindly
Fill your heart with smoke
And the first thing that you want
Will be the last thing you ever need
That's how you fight it

[Hook]
Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time
Just smile all the time

[Verse 1]
I dreamed about killing you again last night
And it felt alright to me
Dying on the banks of Embarcadero skies
I sat and watched you bleed
Buried you alive in a fireworks display
Raining down on me
Your cold, hot blood ran away from me
To the sea

[Verse 2]
I printed my name on the back of a leaf
And I watched it float away
The hope I had in a notebook full of white, dry pages
Was all I tried to save
But the wind blew me back via Chicago
In the middle of the night
And all without fight at the crush of veils and starlight

[Bridge]
I know I'll make it back
One of these days and turn on your TV
To watch a man with a face like mine
Being chased down a busy street
When he gets caught, I won't get up
And I won't go to sleep

[Hook]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Via Chicago

[Verse 3]
Where the cups are cracked and hooked
Above the sink, they make me think
Crumbling ladder, tears don't fall
They shine down your shoulders
And crawling is screw faster lash
And I blow it with kisses
I rest my head on a pillowy star
And a cracked door moon
That says I haven't gone too far

[Hook]

[Outro]
Searching for a home
Searching for a home
Searching for a home
Via Chicago
I'm coming home
I'm coming home

[Verse 1]
I, I should've been listening
To every word you said
Oh, what have I been missing
Wishing, wishing that you were dead
I didn't mean to be so stupid
So far from home
Oh, what have I been learning
By being all alone

[Chorus]
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
(Is gonna) Just tears you apart

[Verse 2]
When, when we were younger
Sleep while I'm awake
I was trying to keep the door locked
I realize that's a mistake

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Every little thing that you do
Seems so much better than I could do
Oh, I should've been listening
To every word you said

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Go back to sleep now, my darling
And I'll keep all the bad dreams away
Breathe now, think sweet things
And I'll think of all the right words to say

[Chorus]
Because we made you, my darling
With the love in each of our hearts
We were a family, my darling
Right from the start

[Verse 2]
Grow up now, my darling
Please don't you grow up too fast
And be sure, darling
To make all the good times last

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
When you wake up, feeling old
This piano filled with souls
Some strange purse stuffed nervous with gold
Can you be where you want to be

[Verse 2]
Walk down any street you can find
Look at any clock telling time
Sing some strange verse
From some strange song of mine
And you'll be where you want to be

[Verse 3]
I know I can't sing
Until she brings the song to life
And I'd blend with kings
Would never change a thing

[Verse 4]
Who knows anything, I don't know
There are so many things
I must leave alone
Some strange person is calling you their home
Can you be where you want to be

[Outro]
Can you be, where you want to be
Can you be, where you want to be
Can you be, where you want to be

[Snoop Dogg]
Is this thing on?
Yeah
Nope

[Verse 1: 

[Snoop Dogg]
Now I just came out the club and now I’m breaking the bud
I’m shaking taking a chance with the Executive Branch
Now I’m making them dance
Keep a blunt in my hand and two packs in my pants
You know the greener the bud, and the strength of the leaf
I’m the Indian chief
They call me Bossaniva, Evel Knieva, Sativa Breatha
Imperial
And brought to you live in stereo
One come test me now
I’m movin' while I’m groovin', floatin' on a sound cloud
Girls wanna kiss us, boo, we got our own
We ain’t fuckin' with them Swishers
So pass it slow
It's the big boss Dogg on my ratchet flow
Catch it tho', can’t scratch it tho'
It's the original fantastico
Acid flow
With the white great interior
Tastes so good
The gentlemen’s choice for sure
The right great cigarillo
Pillow
In the middle
Never grito
I recite my hood rhymes
Smoke one this' for the good times
We gon' blow, forever mo'
So let the girls on the flo'
They just left the Bellagio

The gentlemen’s choice

[Hook]
I'm riding round with my lights on
In broad day
Top down with my shades on
That AK
Right beside me so don't do it
You try me and I'm gon do it
Tell me do you want to die G
Oh well
Fuck it so what Fuck it fuck it so what
Fuck it so what Fuck it fuck it so what x2

[Verse 1:]
I'm riding round with my lights on
My top down my nikes on
My white Tee my AK
Beside me don't get wrong
We won't take no shit home
In broad day we parley
Them broads say
I'm all that
I hit that they call back
Pockets full of them tall stacks
My homeboys we mall rats
Hit gucci hit louis
Hit hermes bought all that
I pull up than hop out
Her hoes shout you say that
Thats T.I. ain't he fly
If not what you call that
Still big bank can't fold it up
Hundred pounds of the loud can't roll enough
Couple hollywood bitches get them both to fuck
Real nigga can't help but notice us
We cool the shit
And we double fuck
You approaching us you know what
You don't give a fuck about your life
Why should I so what

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ay what you know about me
Except you know that I'm on
And all the money I see
From all the places i've gone
Old G's call me O.G
And I'm a young nigga why do you think
Cause i've been putting that work
And I'm moving up in my rank
AK with me I ain't playin'
You get shot if you don't
Know choppers spray
And floss and blaze
And fuck around if you won't
Don't you know
I'm still on bank head
Sit go blowing big dro
At a restaurant eating hot wings
Clip full of them hot things
Seat belt on my AK
Nigga try me and it's mayday
Gon go down no plane crash
Inferno his lame ass
You thank cause I'm famous
I won't grab that banger
Put one in the chamber
Than let go
And say lets go

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I thought that things like this get better with time
But I still need you, why is that?
You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you, around

[Hook]
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
If I got with you, would it feel the same

[Verse 2]
Words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean them, why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to, now why is that?

[Hook]
Oh it's cause I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, I miss you insane
But if I got with you, would it feel the same

[Verse 3]
And it don't matter who you are
It is so simple, a feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple, a feeling
But it's everything

[Verse 1]
After all the jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footprints dressed in red
And the wind whispers Mary

[Verse 2]
A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind it cries Mary

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
The traffic lights they turn blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life they lived is dead
And the wind screams Mary

[Verse 4]
Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past?
And with its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers no, this will be the last
And the wind cries Mary
Kenny Lee on the track
The way I'm flowin'
Keep it goin
I rip up the beat then I sew it, back together
Rap forever, its Philly
Whilly, Now tell your favorite rapper that I'm tryna kill him, Really
I'm in the porsche drop, 911 Porsche box
They can never eat me like a muslim and a pork chop
Of course not, I'm dunkin' until the court drops
Like B. Grif, I eat shit and hoarse blocks. HA!

Flame Spitta you a lame nigga
You can't compare a G4 to a Plane nigga
Thats like versing a peddle bike into a train nigga
Like Earl Boykins and letting Lebron James stick him HA!
It don't make no sense
How your label kick you out like you ain't paid no rent
Always been a star player, I ain't play no bench
Let these hoes be hoes
I dont say no bitch NAH!
I be going rambo
Paws on the pork, but I be going HAM though
Riding on the beat like a mother fucking lambo
Hard Like X with, a '98 Cam flow

Sigel on the Roc, Nas on illmatic
I'm still at it
No matter my choice know Phil back it and cool with it
Still to the jab I move with it, I'm cool fritted
Flyer than most but goon with it and still hood

Honor roll swag real good
Diamond all on your neck but your album is stillwood
Money my medicine, It be making me feel good
They lock me inside a cell, ain't matter I still stood
As tall as Yao Ming, Gasol, Bynum, and Shaq
I'm rocking with rozay, Now they know that I'm back
I'm whippin' in '62 and I ain't talking about crack
I'm talking about that thang 360 stacks
360 Days with 5 more I grind on
On my 

[???] bag get my shine on
Bail money only thing I dropped a dime on
I tell them to get on the level that I'm on

Was tellin' you how I'm moving out
Someone call the fireman just to cool me out
I'm hot smokin' really I'm not jokin'

[???]
Rapping automatic cause really they not smokin'
Put them in the booth kapoof Hokus Pokus
I make magic, Like the Lake Magic
But them in the water I drown em lake placid
And I got bars like I took the jail with me
When they let me out of prison I just took a cell with me
I ain't got to drop an album, do a tape to sell 50
I be blazin' in the booth tell your artist trail with me
They got a nigga on trial, they said I murdered the beat
They feel my pin and my pad my finger prints on the sheet

[Fades out while still rapping]

[Verse 1: Lou Williams]
I must be Maserati dreamin', I can't sleep at night
I wake up, I say my prayers. Thank god I live my life
I'm in a GranTurismo 2 tone
Passenger's a red bone
Whoo! She's like the car cause she can't never keep her top on
See here, I was sleeping in class missing the lessons
I was millionaire dreamin'. Fuck passing these tests
My teachers used to say I was lazy and second-guessing
Now I'm laughing at they ass, blowing cash, and countin' blessings
I understood the SATs, yeah, OK, but
What about these million dollars these luxury Benz cuts
Them Escalades on 26's them tires they thin cut
You mean to tell me you'd pass up steak and lobster for school lunch
I made my first mill told moms I was leaving home
Then I made 30 more god damn I was puttin' on
I used to dollar menu and spectate at the mall
But now I'm buying that bitch out, cuz shit I want it all

[Hook]
Cause I want it all
I want it all
Yeah I deserve the world cause I hustle hard
Yeah I want it all
I want it all
You know I'm on my grind cause I hustle hard
I'm in it for the money and the cars, the clothes and the hoes
The diamonds on my neck and wrist froze
Cause I want it all
Cause I want it all
Hey

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
First off where the money at
Cause I go crazy 'bout that paper I'm a money-ac
My hood prefer to walk but I be runnin' that
So far gone you would think I wasn't coming back
South D and George Kush, we ain't smoking none of that
You be puffin on that Reggie Bush (cough cough) running back
You just bought a used car, you think you gon' stunt in that
I just bought a Audemar and my shit it cost double that
Crushing that
Stuntin' is my favorite sport
Eatin' without no playing fork
On the road to riches and I ain't got no plan on taking shorts
Some people will call it greedy I just call it making sure
If I ain't got no food up on my plate then I'll be taking yours
I know what I want, I know what I'm doing
They telling me different, I know where I'm going
Fuck talkin' about it, I'll show 'em I'm doing
Progress in the night and ???

[Hook]

(Verse 3: Meek Mill & Lou Williams)
(Meek Mill)
Mind on my money
Money in my pocket
Thousand Benny Franks
Man you know nothin' 'bout it
That's money in the bank
He selling in my closet, winning no matter what
Losing ain't a option
I said, they ain't see my vision though
All I had to do was break it down like the vision though
They wanted that fake shit, I was on original
They ain't gonna get it for me I'mma go and get it oh
(Lou Williams)
OK a mill ain't shit
And a problem ain't either
Keep a couple of both long as I'm filling up arenas
Philly it's ice cold so punch yo heat keep the heater
Big dawg on his hip, like an old school beeper
I'm barely even legal but I'm 4 cars deep
Three houses to my name my people stealing these streets
The hell with VIP, y'all ain't gotta hide me
I'm on the dance floor shit, Meek he know where I be

[Hook]

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
I'm a thuuuuuuuug
Even though I wanna change my life and get it right
To the judge, I'm always gon' be a thuuug
Like O-Dog, "Menace II Society"
They wanna see me underground
But I just bought a plane, hey, hey
Sky is the limit now; my jet just took off the ground now
And ain't nobody gon' stop my destiny, destiny, no no no
Ladies night - pop a bottle now
Cause the wear just came off now
From doin'; time in the penitentiary, yeah
And if you come from the ghetto and you feel like a champion
Let me see you put your hands up (put your hands up)
Put your hands up (put your hands up)
Put your hands up (put your hands up)
Put your hands up (put your hands up)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
The sun beamin' on my chick in my {?}
Feelin' hipper than a hippie in a tye-dye shirt
Gucci Mane motherfucker and the earth my turf
Ice cold, buzz hotter than July 1st
Oooh, this the type of tune make a dime choose
He make it rain, then I can make it monsoon
I buy a bitch out her contract, dumb stacks
Suckers sleepin' on me Zantax, I'm deadly
I'm talkin' Anthrax, the other side of the tracks
You know the Amtrak; multi-millionaire still rockin' amulets
I was turnt up to the mess but now I'm past that
But now I'm past that
I move stealth, I'm gettin' jealous of myself
Me and Wyclef and the swagger's SoSoDef
Smoke pounds of that 'dro 'dro from out West
And I ain't made at no one cause I'm oh so blessed
It's Gucci

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
I'm a thuuuuuuuug
Even though I wanna change my life and get it right
To the judge, I'm always gon' be a thuuug
Like O-Dog, "Menace II Society"
They wanna see me underground
But I just bought a plane, hey, hey
Sky is the limit now; my jet just took off the ground now
And ain't nobody gon' stop my destiny, destiny, no no no
Ladies night - pop a bottle now
Cause the wear just came off now
From doin'; time in the penitentiary, yeah
And if you come from the ghetto and you feel like a champion
Let me see you put your hands up (put your hands up)
Put your hands up (put your hands up)
Put your hands up (put your hands up)
Put your hands up (put your hands up)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Tired of all these late nights, smoked out shit
Ain't no mo' leavin' the club three or fo' bad chicks
I ain't goin' to the lot, coppin' no mo' whips
I ain't drinkin', all the pills, I'm all done, I quit
Psych! I'm poppin' wheelies with a dime on the bike
My baby right, she whispered in my ear tonight is the night
I'm higher than a kite, bright ice, in need of a light
Pilot lighter light it homey as I lean to my stripe
Ye ain't freshest out here, ye ain't ballin like me
Baby talk can't comprehend, talkin' foreign to more
Purple label, Polo, Revlon on me
I'm the big homey, you a big phony (well damn!)
Makin' movies in the V.I.P. I need a Tony
Gucci Mane Tarantino with the tendonitis
Pour 80 bottles in her face, now she dancin' on me
She know she dancin' with a star them diamonds dancin' on me
It's Gucci

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
I'm a thug
Even though I wanna change my life and get it right
To the judge, I'm always gon' be a thug
Like O-Dog, "Menace II Society"
They wanna see me underground
But I just bought a plane, hey, hey
Sky is the limit now; my jet just took off the ground now
And ain't nobody gon' stop my destiny, destiny, no no no
Ladies night - pop a bottle now
Cause the wear just came off now
From doin; time in the penitentiary, yeah
And if you come from the ghetto and you feel like a champion
Let me see you put your hands up (put your hands up)
Put your hands up (put your hands up)
Put your hands up (put your hands up)
Put your hands up (put your hands up)

[Outro]
It's Gucci

[Hook: Estelle (Gucci Mane)]
Now that I'm finally free
I'm bouta throw it today
I take my life in my hands
Cause I'm a grown-ass man
(I'm a grown-ass man)
Now that I'm finally free

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I was lost, but now I'm found
I was blind, but now I see
Super high, can't touch the ground
Life tested me, but God blessin' me
Every 16 bars is a testimony
From the jailhouse junk to the Testarossa
Had to find myself, then remind myself
Fuck up, I'm grown, I got to blame myself
Streets taught me everything, I trained myself
Dead wrong so long, didn't know nothin' else
They wanna lock my crew up like ???
Think every man ??? and amuse himself
Glad as well, but I'm mad as hell
Because my best friend probably gon' die in jail
Ain't no lie to tell, probably cry like hell
If I dwell on it, cause he got 80 years
I'm going hard, you see I might as well
Cause I got a hard head like my daddy had
And my daddy's dead
I bet my great great great great grandpa had a real crazy swag
So I stand today, then get down to pray
The second is now and my mind is made
I got a point to prove, and a son to raise
Can't let him make mistakes that his daddy made

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Squash the beef I'm free of that
This crazy song, they ain't feelin' that
I guess they wanna see us kill each other
If I'm dead, who the fuck gonna help my mother
I done struggled and hustled too hard for this
I done rob stealed killed, ain't proud of that
Smoke weed, took pills and sold powder packs
I'm a soldier but you stand, where the cowards at?
Man your homeboy gone where the flowers at
All the money in the world can't bring that back
If I had one wish, wish mom and dad could
Come down now and see me rap
But she see me now, and I believe in that
On the strength of that I ain't goin' back
So I put my whole family on my back
Lost so much time, can't pay that back
I was lost, but now I'm found
I was blind, but now I see
Super high, can't touch the ground
Life tested me, but God blessin' me
Every 16 bars is a testimony
From the jailhouse junk to the Testarossa
Had to find myself, then remind myself
Fuck up, I'm grown, I got to blame myself
It's Gucci

[Hook] x2

[Outro: Estelle]
I was lost, but now I'm found
Don't you ?? then keep me down
See my life go round and round
I say I straightened up my act
And I ain't never goin' back

Now that I' m finally free (finally free)
You'll never take me away (you'll never take me away)
Took everything that I have (everything that I)
???????????
Now that I'm finally free (oh finally free)
I'm bouta throw it today (throw it today)
I take my life in my hands (I take my life in my hands)
Cause I'm a grown-ass man (I'm a grown-ass man)
Now that I'm finally free
I'm a grown-ass man

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Wife beater, yellow diamonds, lookin' pretty
Your chick took a look, now she hooked, shawty with it
Ferrari with the yellow forgiatos, Gucci tripping
I hit the button in my Scaglietti and get missing
Girlfriend missing, now you feel me?
458 paper tag it get missing, it get missing, it get missing
I hit the thrax pass it back, girl lets get missing

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
?? filled the wrong prescription, I'm lifted, I'm gifted
The hood can't get enough, they addicted
My pinky cost a 50 plus a 50
50 at 100, quarter ticket
She miss me she wish she didn't get so damn addicted
Afflicted she don't wanna be a statistic
First round pick, she a bad bitch, a bad bitch
Lookin' at me lookin' at her, damn she a draft pick
Elaborate, photographic, gots to have it
My Georgia dick'll have her havin' dreams of getting married
Riding through Zone Six Atlanta in a carriage
White house, with white girls and they dancing nasty
Redbones, two redbones and they tatted
Plug talking Spanish like Scarface and Manny
Ten birds, ten whole thangs in the pantry
Dress fit just right, she forgot the panties

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
You think that I'm a sweet lick, boy you trippin'
That's a dummy mission, end up missin'
Face on a milk carton do you feel me?
200 in the AR, bullets flippin'
I ain't gotta talk, say a word they just blitzin'
I ain't gotta rap, I got more racks than Neiman's
Stacks in my pocket, every one that's a meanin'
60 grand rubber band, that's how I'm livin'
I got too much True Religion like I'm Lenox
I'm stocked up, I need to send some denims on clearance
Gwapped up, get eighty an appearance
Hater, pretty lady, she can get it
We can get a bite to eat, lets get missing
My Ferrari's a sight to see, half a milli
Freshest nigga you done seen, in a minute
Party nightly every day I handle business

[Hook]

[Verse 3: ]
This is the life, fa la la la
I'm poppin bottles me and my entourage
Pull up in phantoms, 'raris, lambs and vettes
Forgiatos shine to D.U.B's and ??
Ain't no scary money, plenty money girl we rich
100 bottles, 50 deep tell your girls you with
They can kick it with some gangstas smokin bud and shit
They like boy you too damn icy for this club ya digg
They call me
I'm with my boy Gucci Mane, Brick Squad that is
All the girls think that I'm too cool for this club ya digg

[Hook]

[Hook: Ray J]
Do you remember when I met you girl everything was alright
Do you remember when we got a room we was fucking all night
Do you remember the time, girl?
Like I remember the time, girl

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Girl you my type, you just right
That blouse on you fit just right
Them jeans she got on skin-tight
She sexy, cool, but still shy
I'm colder than a Klondike
My polar I got dumb ice
We know each other, we go together
Like hamburgers and french fries
Everything is alright
We'll never have a fist fight
But last night had a sex fight
Then told her have a blessed night
I'm leanin', I'm meanin'
I fall asleep might have dreams in it
Hit the club and bring my team in it
Not tonight, I'mma bring my queen in it
I go get it, you bullshitters
I hit it, damn right that kid did it
You hood critics and hood chickens
Please try to stay out my business
From south France to south Philly
ATL to North Memphis
From my city, to your city
Think you got more swag but not really

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I'mma put it down
So Gucci gon' wake up so
I run it it's gon' hurt
But when I'm gone it'll make you want mo'
Scented oils and candles
I pull up in my Lambo
The bestest that you never had
Two backstreets off the main road
You had her but she left so
That's just the way the game go
No one on my level so get up out my lane ho
I met a girl so real that it's no need to run no game on
Reminisce of Gucci every time they play my same song
I'm on her like a long john
Short skirt with no thongs on
Sexy naked sunbathin' outside my house with frames on
I took her for some buster and that boy ain't gon' do shit about it
It's alright if we kick it, tell that sucker forget about it

[Hook]

[Bridge: Ray J]
Girls to my right, ladies to my left
The weather's real hot, snow on my chest
And I see this fly girl, tried to get her number
Then she tells me that I already smashed last summer (remember?)
Mile high club, G5 planes
Remember back rubs and pink champagne
Mile high club, G5 planes
Remember back rubs and pink champagne

[Hook]

For this fat sack of dagga, yo I'm smoking a spliff

Round the corner gooi n lekker spif, Tokyo Drift

There's also a lot of motherfuckin' money, bitches and weed
Ja, dagga dagga dagga! Puff puff puff!
Bring the beat back Hi-Tek!

[Intro: DJ Khaled & Meek Mill]
Ahh
DJ Khaled
Yeah
Meek Milly
Yo, turn the music up a little bit
We The Best
Yeah

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Free Boosie, real nigga
In the jail standing tall like Shaquille nigga
I used to say, "I know how you feel, nigga"
It’s like a full time job not to kill niggas
Had my hood hating, I done came up
I don’t know if it’s the money or the fake stuff
Got me walking through the jungle with my flame tucked
Got around my juries since they want to see me chained up
Friends turn to foes when you're in a Rolls
Model bitches turn to hoes cause a nigga froze
Got them people taking pictures, let a nigga pose
Cause I get paid for reading scripts, been getting shows
Poppin' bottles it sound like a Mac-10
Phantom be so big, beep when I back in
I dropped a quarter milli on an Aston
And I ain’t got an album, but I got these niggas balling out
I’m gone

[Chorus: Meek Mill & DJ Khaled]
Shout out to the real niggas (Salute)
And shout out to the real bitches (Say what)
I’m popping bottles with my real niggas
It’s like a full time job not to kill niggas
Shout out to the real niggas (Salute)
And shout out to the real bitches (Say what)
I’m popping bottles with my real niggas
It’s like a full time job-
Ace Hood

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Yeah, bought a chopper for my problems, that banana type
Seen a millie, now it’s hard for me to sleep at night
I’m the type to flood the rollie like it's New Orleans (woo)
Bet that all my niggas ball like I’m Mr. Clean
From the bottom to the top, I made it out the gutter
I’m 17 on every scene I need my bread and butter (butter)
Used to run the streets, but now I’m running every summer (summer)
Right back on my bullshit like a Chicago lover
Feel like I'm jumping up out that phantom on my cocky ass
Know they hating, I just tell 'em kiss the paper tags
Still be with them pretty bitches, save for Stacy Dash
Plus my rollie cost me 80, that's gon' make 'em mad
Free my niggas locked, free my nigga caged
Fuck the system yeah you know we on the same page
Niggas love it when you're drowning in that water, dawg
Hate to see a nigga shining like some Armor All
Loyalty over royalty that’s my common law
We The Best: the logo, and I'm with my fucking boss (Khaled)
He just tell me murder niggas would think of Holocaust
Kill the hottest young'n in and what you niggas thought

[Chorus: Meek Mill, Plies, & DJ Khaled]
Shout out to the real niggas (Salute)
And shout out to the real bitches (Say what)
I’m popping bottles with my real niggas
It’s like a full time job not to kill niggas
Shout out to the real niggas (Salute) (Ace, what up)
And shout out to the real bitches (Say what)
I’m popping bottles with my real niggas
It’s like a full time job not to-
Plies

[Verse 3: Plies]
They took a half a M nigga, out the bank nigga
If you want to whip 'em pussy nigga, blank nigga
And I put that red dot right where you think nigga
Hood nigga still wearing cuban linx nigga
I’m on the ave. nigga riding in a cutlass
You that talking nigga, you know you a pussy
A real nigga, real life, no rap shit
And I can promise you this ain’t what you want, bitch
30 mill and I still ain't been to LIV nigga
‘Cause I was to busy to gutter with the real niggas
When you see me in the field tell me how you feel nigga
And we some kids to each other if you real nigga
And they ain’t telling none of my young nigga to chill, nigga
We all shooters, nigga, and all us on the pills nigga
Ain’t got a yacht, but nigga the size of Shaquille, nigga
And before you try me nigga you better write your will, nigga

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Shout out to the real niggas (Salute)
And shout out to the real bitches (Say what)
I’m popping bottles with my real niggas
It’s like a full time job not to kill niggas
Shout out to the real niggas (Salute)
And shout out to the real bitches (Say what)
I’m popping bottles with my real niggas
It’s like a full time job not to kill niggas

DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: J Cole]
And you know it don't stop, grindin' 'round that clock
Masterminding my second album, my first album just dropped
Scored a touchdown on my first down
Niggas thought I was gon' flop
See I hustle like my momma but I look just like my pops, ha
And we still duckin' cops, ride around and take shots
Hennessy for my enemies, niggas know I'm takin' they spot
'Cause that score up on the play clock show just how I came from way back
Just like T-I-P told you—ASAP; but you niggas rappin' like Aesop, Aesop, get a grip!

[Pre-Chorus 1: J. Cole]
Oh that's your dream car? Nigga that's my old whip
Oh that's your dream girl? Nigga that's my old bitch
Oh that's your new flow? Nigga that's my old shit!
This that new K.R.I.T. shit, that Cole shit, them country niggas

[Chorus: J. Cole]
One for the money, two for the show
Three for them hoes saying anything goes
They say they ready for whatever!
They say they ready for whatever
I been around the world: twice, to be exact
Six bad bitches and they lapped up in the back
They say they ready for whatever! Ha
They say they ready for whatever

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Yuh, yuh, Young Krizzle
Shawty look what we got (we got), my bass beat and it knock (It knock)
Got the old school in my old school was to post up on your block (Your block)
Yo broad chose like she was s'posed to and you up in arms 'cause she bopped (She bopped)
Cole I hate to say it but I got to say that I wish that they would just stop (Whoa)
So fuck these haters, fuck these hoes that ain't slammin' doors on they drop (Whoa)
Y'all niggas too young to remember how to the South used to be, but I'm not (Whoa)
So when it come to snappin', Cadillacs, SpottieOttieDopaliscious, y'all pop (Whoa)
You thought Krit Wuz Here and R4 were the shit? Bitch, wait 'til my album drop (Get 'em girls)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Say that's your new car? Nigga, that's my old slab

Oh that's yo new flow? That shit sound so trash
This that new K.R.I.T. shit, that Cole shit, them country niggas

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Hol' up...but don't forget about Compton, nigga!
One for the money, two for the show
Three for No Limit and the rest for Death Row
That means I been 'bout it 'bout it and this is the realest shit I ever wrote
And if anyone ever doubt it, then they are the loudest of liars I know
I only desire to blow, she only desire to blow
And I hope that my dick is a whistling flute
And that's not the instrumental
Now pick up my coat
You let that motherfucker drag like RuPaul
I'll drag your ass to the floor
Bitch, I can admit, I'm a recovered addict, paraphernalia that is
Telling the doctor I'm sick, head doctor, I'm needing your lips, yeah
Proper analogy for it, if I can afford it, then I won't ignore it, clear
Cop me a palace and Porsche and right, when I floor it, that's when I switch gears
Living my life on Uranus, ugh, keeping one foot in your anus, ugh
The other foot all on your neck, repeatedly stomp 'til I break it, ugh
Bitch I'm demanding respect, these bitches is telling me, "Take it"
DJ Khaled, even if I had callus, holding the torch ain't no challenge, ain't it? Ooh, huhuhu

[Chorus: J. Cole]
One for the money, two for the show
Three for them hoes saying anything goes
They say they ready for whatever!
They say they ready for whatever
I been around the world: twice, to be exact
Six bad bitches and they lapped up in the back
They say they ready for whatever! Ha
They say they ready for whatever

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Yea, yellin’ fuck a 9 to 5 boi

They threw me in the game
I threw up numbers like an auction
‘Cause I do it, do it ,do it
Like it’s no other option
Fat asses, big bottles
When I’m around they both get poppin’
I talk about girls and money
Too much I admit, way too much girls
Too much money, those 2 things that don’t exist
And I think It's so impressive I’m riding in the back
Young and black ’cause I’m chauffeured and not ’cause I’m arrested
Getting richer every year, yeah congrats to my progression
Got the finest with her shirt off and skirt off
Showing her blessings

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Man I’m so blessed (I’m so blessed)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I wonder what the haters got to say now
They mad I’m on top of my game and they down
I’m always repping for my gang I stay down
Ain’t gotta go back to my hood ’cause they 'round
And the niggas that’s next to me
It’s all the niggas that stress with me
I done made it from the bottom and they say I did it on my own
So to me that’s destiny
If anybody got a problem I just tell ‘em to get on their grind
Try to to see as much checks as me
And my wife is a goddess my tree is the finest
A click full of real niggas that's just the one thing about us
They showin’ us love, but I remember back then
The niggas would doubt us
We used to go out but now when we go out all the people surround us
They screaming my name, I’m repping my city
It’s me who they proud of
So fuck what the lames about wouldn't be
No game without us no game without us

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Man I’m so blessed (I’m so blessed)
I got the Lord on my shoulders

[Verse 3: Ace Hood]
Been hated on, I been doubted
Been talked about and mistreated
Still put in the work that I needed
Now I’m living the things that I’m dreaming
Got my mama straight and my daughter good
And my team right ’cause we eating
Been broke before and now its open doors
I got the dopest flow and they seen it
God keep away all them demons
Been patient dog I’ve been lenient
Been holding out I’ve been fiending
Long as God with me don’t need ‘em
When you winning everybody want a dap up
Gettin' money now your friends wanna act up

From the bottom to the top only Lord knows

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Man I’m so blessed (I’m so blessed)

This shit's special

J.U.S.T.I.C.E League

[Verse 1: Scarface]
And if I cry two tears for her
That would be the most that I would give to her
She left me stranded in my nightmares
Taking pictures of my memories—she right there
Twisting on the blade in my heart, deep
Always on my mind, so I can't sleep
She used to tell me she was all mine
Now, the only way I see the broad is online
I'm doing drugs trying to feel you
I'm killing me trying to kill you
I built my whole life around you
I thought I found it all when I found her
Shopping sprees on whatever coast
How'd you really feel? I may never know
And as I ride through these streets
With my hand on my heat, eyes red from the Sweets, I
Realize some things never change
Once in love and it's gone, you don't look at it the same, man
Fuck love, 'cause she don't live here
I'm soaked in blood, but I'm still here
Hip-hop heartbreaks
Straight-laced, deep bass, 808s, plus the mixtapes
Got a nigga feeling like I up and let you—
Get away, now you all in the lectures
Being studied by the colleges, professors
Now, I regret the day I met ya (Bitch)
I'll be the first one to say it
She ain't the one you want to play with
I fucked hip-hop

[Verse 2: Nas]
And if— And if— And if— And if I cry two tears for her
That would be the most that I can give to her
I am Joseph, Darryl, Jason, Dr. Dre, O'Shea
And a host of those who passed away
Today, I'm Drake, I'm Wayne, 2 Chainz
You say you want to rap—to this bitch, you must commit
Then you're a slave to your grave
You won't get out, you cannot quit
She menstruates weekly, her Vibe covers keep you warm
But the source to her heart is love—word up, right on
You know how girls are
She love when you licking on her WorldStar
Kissing on her belly, trick on her at Onyx
Confused fans think that she illuminates demonic
But she's the object of my affections, God's essence, God bless her
She bought me Bentleys, Breitlings
Made some friends resent me for writing about my life
They thought I should have stayed quiet
She took me to places I would've never saw without her
And she took me from my girl powder
I doubt I'll ever be the same, ugh, hallowed be Thy name
Give me strength so I don't do this dame like Orenthal James
Brad warned me while driving this auburn Ferrari
Never follow in her games, I fuck around and I'll be sorry
But I tried her, used to ride her—for dollars, not for fame
She slowed me down and had me guzzling on cups of lean
She's a middle-aged cougar, showing young'uns the dream
Noticed she wasn't breathing for a second
Then, I screamed, "She's dead!"
And everybody took it out on Nasty
I was just looking out for my music family
Wasn't trying to claim her to myself, she's yours
You can have her—she's a motherfucking whore
I fuck hip-hop

[Scratch Outro 1: DJ Premier]
And if I cry two tears for her
That would be the most that I would I give to her
She ain’t the one you wanna play with
You say you wanna rap, to this bitch you must commit
I fucked hip-hop
And if I cry two tears for her
That will be the most I can give to her
She ain’t the one you wanna play with
I fuck hip-hop
And you all know how the story go

Everybody going broke, keep it real, you gotta fight it
Hundred kilos in the Bimmer, boy don’t make me get excited
Couple milli on the neck like I’m tryna get indicted
Got a mansion, got a yacht, bad bitch and a tiger, huh
Real niggas, taking over televisions (Huh)
Dope boys riding in a new set of Benzes
Hot boy, Young boy, still on fire

Just to let my niggas hold on when they rollin, it could kill ‘em
And these suckas, I don’t feel ‘em

I’mma die fly, Rest in Peace Aaliyah
Half my dawgs dead, the rest of them is here
If all your jewels fake, how the fuck we gon believe ya
Said I did it for my dawgs, did it for my dawgs
Everybody ridin’ till you sit ‘em in the morgue
Started with a Bonne now I’m sittin’ in a Porsche
With the shooters right behind me
Shit, you looking at a boss
Rose gold rolie on my wrist, flawless
Hundred bottles send ‘em to the vip, ballin’
Basketball leather in the Benz, Spalding
Ya’ll niggas talking, fuck is yall retarded?

[Chorus: Rick Ross & French Montana]
I did it for my dawgs (I did it for my dawgs)

[Verse 3: French Montana]
I did it for my dawgs (Woo)
Did it for them niggas with a vision like a boss
Did it for them niggas in the kitchen with the salt
Now I’m in that white thing, 500 horses for my niggas in the coffin
Got price on my head, I'm in a drop top 'rari
Staring at the ceiling when I wake up in the morning
My dawg doing life, try to see him ‘fore he hit the coffin’ (Haan)
Play with my paper, run up in your offices
It’s the ’012 Ice Cube nigga with the Raider hat
A maniac nigga, where the paper at
Highway to life, need a hundred mill exit (Woo)
50 on the wrist, hundred on the necklace

[Verse 4: Ace Hood]
Ok I did it for them niggas who they lockin' in them jail cells
Go to court they under oath they never tattle tale
Tired of countin money bitch I went and bought a scale
Homie caught a case I put a quarter on the bail
Look my brothers keeper, sleeping with the reaper
Rims on the jeep sittin higher than Khalifa
Its that black boy sleeves tatted, dreadlocks, fuck cops
Ridin with the burner turn your shirt into a tank top
20 chains on you would think I'm in a headlock
Everything foreign like I grew up on a spain block

And I know tomorrow ain't promised but I hope it is
Love to get acquanted with you
Stay and tear the jail up
Did it for my dawgs so I had to put the bails up (Yeah)
Get them thangs off so I haven’t put the scales up
Treat you like a pit, get ya ears and ya tail cut (Uh)
Choppas still hot, you can hold it for yourself
Versace, same buckle on the loafers and the belt
Yeh the pills is flying but the smokers is something else
If the spot catch fire, the coke will just really melt (Ahh)
The dough got ‘em bringing in the broads (Come on)
Obvious the flow got ‘em screaming for the lord (Lord)
If there’s money on ya head, what you think is the reward?

Pocket full of money, bitch, and my crew eating
Got a nigga shining like a brand new nickel
Plated pistol, this's my last shot
Just left the dealership and I cashed out

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Ace Hood]
If I stand next to ice, then I'm camouflaged (Why)

I don't see you broads, I don't-I don't (Yeh) see you broads
My future's so bright, that all I see is stars
My shades on in the club, I don't (Yeah) see you broads

[Verse 3: Birdman]
In the kitchen and we cooking up that raw hog
Dry when shining, I'm a movie star
Open up the bank bitch, bring em large
Flip em and we bust em, then we ship em off
Perpetrating'll get your head bust
A hundred million, 'll get you dope flush
A new Bentley, you get a ho rush
Big money shit, we popping cause we came up
Hella choppers, on them new thangs
Big yachts, brand new wings
Them hoes yapping, cause they know the frame
Cardinal, Ten Carats on my pinky ring

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
If I stand next to ice, then I'm camouflaged
If I stand next to lights, then I'm camouflaged
My future's so bright, that all I see is stars
My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads
I don't see you broads, I don't-I don't see you broads
I don't see you broads, I don't-I don't see you broads
Future's so bright, that all I see is stars
My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads

[Outro: Birdman]
Yeah, just like that my nigga
Dark rum, ton of shades on

And the club gettin lines on it
Backroom nigga

Yeah, I rock to this one my nigga
Let's get it

[Chorus: Kirko Bangz]
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Man I'm too playa for that
Too many bitches in the world right now
That'll fuck around and pray for that
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
I don't pay for no pussy
I won't pay for no pussy
And I ain't buyin' no Gucci
Say I ain't trying to pay for it
I'm a motherfucking G
And I should make these bitches pay me
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Hell naw man I'm too throwed
Niggas stay getting shows
Make a lot of money, never trick to these hoes

[Verse 1: Wale]
Pay for that, not me, no hell
Y'all the one that bring the c-notes out
This is K.O.D., now they wait on me
Cause if I do not arrive, there wouldn't be no show
Wale, Wale
Hear you talking, but I cannot stay
Chicks involved, but I cannot stay
I spit the raw, I leave a gay bitch, late
Turn your date to a lake, turn your 8 to a great
Turn a nine to a damn! without paying for the date
No debate, ain't no John
You done broke the safe just to get those broads
You been playing the Uno but you getting no drawers
And I poke her face and let her hold no cards
I ain't even tripping, or paying these women
Got plenty fish in that ocean and my rod game is so vicious
And my sharp show is at 4:50, can I use the rip in 5: 15
Now I 62 cause I get the loot, and she's gon' kiss the ring but no wedding

[Chorus: Kirko Bangz]
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Man I'm too playa for that
Too many bitches in the world right now

And I ain't buyin' no Gucci
Say I ain't trying to pay for it

And I should make these bitches pay me
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Hell naw man I'm too throwed
Niggas stay getting shows
Make a lot of money, never trick to these hoes

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Clap that ass, bitch, turn up
Nigga kill the pussy, call it murder
Swerve in the Murcielago
Me without a foreign car, man that's unheard of
In the Maybach, king with my feet up
Curtains drawn, bitch scream when you see us
Hi, I'm your leader, word to Onika
2500 for the sneakers, dope ass nigga, no beeper
I was 16 with a Beamer
Glock with the watch on Aquafina
Niggas going, hyena
Getting pussy posted up at the Dinah
Now we pull up, post in Medinas
With light-skinned bitch like Gina
Aston, Martin
Man that motherfucker cold like Keyshia
Stop signs, Simon says
We don't give a fuck, we run them
Like Tommy Young, been barely men
Man broke niggas, we don't live with them
I don't fuck around, I just fuck her friends
Got eagle doors on that brand new Benz
And a threesome with two twenty twins
I'm rich, bitch

[Chorus: Kirko Bangz]
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Man I'm too playa for that
Too many bitches in the world right now
That'll fuck around and pray for that
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it

And I should make these bitches pay me
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Hell naw man I'm too throwed
Niggas stay getting shows
Make a lot of money, never trick to these hoes

[Verse 3: Mack Maine]
Bitch I'm Mack Ma-i-i-i-ine
Trick what? Lace who?
Baby girl, that ain't what Maine do
Before I chase you, I replace you
Before I break you off, I'mma break you
Matter of fact, fuck you
Got a hundred chicks on my tour bus
Asian chicks, they adore us
I'm feeling like the nigga on the chorus
(Got this drank in my cup
And I'm 'bout to roll up)
Man this bitch talking too much, dawg
(I done came down, hold up)
Heard a nigga say pimping was dead
I showed them my watch and corrected them quick like, "Nah, niggas you're scared"
Now go get you some bread
See it's...
(Money over bitches, and bread over bed)
Tell a bitch that I know Khaled, and she take it to the head
Shit
Shit, one go to store for me
Got another one that's trying to ho for me
Hopefully, she bring more hoes to me
And reverse the game and make em bring dough to me

[Chorus: Kirko Bangz]
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Man I'm too playa for that
Too many bitches in the world right now
That'll fuck around and pray for that
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
I don't pay for no pussy
I won't pay for no pussy
And I ain't buyin' no Gucci
Say I ain't trying to pay for it

And I should make these bitches pay me
Say I ain't trying to pay, for it
Hell naw man I'm too throwed

[Verse: DJ Khaled]
Heard them people seeking problems with the Godfather
Shockers keep them llama get your head trauma
Pussy boys rather see me dead, mama
Instead I'm in that Maybach texting William Roberts
Riding through the city with my hammer close
Pray to Allah that this trick does not have bash results
Self made all it took was faith and lots of hope
Understand this the realest shit I ever wrote
Arab from the middle east Jerusalem
Duplicate me will never be I'm hot as Lucifer
Palestine mastermind, rowie face, bezels shine
Smoking good, counting paper, tryin' to dodge the Babylon
Yeah, I'm well respected and that's on any block
Talk about the gutter you just pray to make it out
Puffing ganja with them wassels with them dreadlocks
Cracking lots with them mobsters get your dog shot
Motherfucking mogul, foreign without an owner
Motherfucking neighbours bought the whole corner
Bought the whole block,stuntin' on you fuck boys
We the best of all, gotta get that young boy
Gotta let me get 'em
Nah Ace, they don't want war
Just let me get 'em
Nah Ace, they don't want war
I got 'em, I got 'em
Nah Ace, they don't want war
Cause that's that shit we came for
(Khaled)
Steamed fish was amazing, matter of fact
Let me get some jerk chicken to go
Grabbed me one of them lemon pie theories
And let me get some of them cash you theories too
And give me another champaingne cola
But let me ask you a question
What happened to them people asking about me
You supposed to bring them to me

(Waitress)
Dey no sai mistar Khaled
Dey say me one thang one dat you
It let those take their next chance
And dem boi just

(Outro)
Hahahaha, I always told my dogs everyone got a choice

Diamonds that got them watching

Chopper in the trunk in case your mood swing
Extended clips that’s standing tall; two chain

[Chorus: Ace Hood]

If it ain't about no money, then it ain't about me, nigga (Nigga)
Yeah, gotta bop like this
Can't wear skinny jeans 'cause my Glock won't fit (Nope)
No one on the corner got a swagger like this

Fuck a whip, just bought me a boat (Boat)
My flow (Flow) is gross (Gross)
Used to be bread (Get it?), now it's toast
Want that one? You reachin'
You ain't close (Get it?), no (No)

[Chorus: Pharrell]
Oh, you ain't know? (Oh, you ain't know?)
Since I was born (Since I was born)
My mind was gone (My mind was gone)
Know I was poor, girl, my mind made me rich
I just go (I just go)
And my wrist was cold (Wrist was cold)
My world was snow (My world was snow)
What I need light for? (Huh?)
Girl, I'm bright as a bitch, I just glow (So special)

I'm so special (Say what?)
Girl, I'm bright as a bitch, I just glow

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I rap a lot (Huh), rap a lot (Huh)
Don't be afraid, it's just aftershock
That jam like when Shaq grab the rock
I'm goin' in like a Magic shot
Your raps sweet like apricots
Shut the fuck up, you don't have to talk
I'ma lay back with my ass on top
Got the game on Master Lock, motherfucker (Let's go)
You don't see cash a lot
Bitch, stop actin' like you bad; you not
I put my dick in her ass and twat
She look back, like, "That's the spot" (Huh)
Homie, I'm countin' money
Playin' round with money (Money)
But y'all ain't shit without your money (Nope)
Life ain't all 'bout the money
Well, it kinda is if you out of money (Woo!)
Mac Millions, that's the name
Most Dope, that's the gang (Gang)
Drunk bitch, so glad she came
Started takin' off her clothes, tryna have a train (Haha)
Hoes love us, tryna fuck us with no rubbers
Fuck that, we make 'em fuck each other
On tour, we make her fuck the runner (Haha), motherfucker
Just the shit that you need (Need)
You ain't fuckin' round with my team (Team)
'Cause we livin' all of your dreams
Here to kill your self-esteem (Huh)
And my flow, that's pyro
Smokin' blunts 'til my eyes close (Close)
Middle finger up high, though (Fuck 'em)
End the song on a high note

[Chorus: Pharrell]
Oh, you ain't know? (Oh, you ain't know?)
Since I was born (Since I was born)
My mind was gone (My mind was gone)
Know I was poor, girl, my mind made me rich
I just go (I just go)
And my wrist was cold (Wrist was cold)
My world was snow (My world was snow)
What I need light for? (Huh?)

[Outro: Mac Miller]
Yeah
Yeah
I be eatin' that Pink Slime
Bitch, that Pink Slime
Motherfucker!
Ah!

[Verse 1]
Well, last night these two bouncers
And one of 'em's alright, the other one's a scary'un
His way or no way; totalitarian
He's got no time for you looking or breathing
How he don’t want you to, so step out the queue
He makes examples of you, and there's nowt you can say
Behind they go through to the bit where you pay
And you realise then that it's finally the time
To walk back past ten-thousand eyes in the line
And you can swap jumpers and make another move
Instilled in your brain you've got something to prove
To all the smirking faces and the boys in black
Why can't they be pleasant? Why can't they have a laugh?
He's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a duff
Well, secretly I think they want you all to kick off
They want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
It's just something to talk about, a story to tell, yeah

[Chorus]
Well, I'm so glad they turned us all away, we'll put it down to fate
I said a thousand million things that I could never say this morning
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

[Verse 2]
Well, this town's a different town today
Said, this town's a different town to what it was last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday
And that girl's a different girl today
Said, that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday
Of course not

[Chorus]
Well, I'm so glad they turned us all away, we'll put it down to fate
I thought a thousand million things that I could never think this morning
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

[Verse 3]
Last night, what we talked about
It made so much sense
But now the haze has ascended
It don't make no sense anymore
I said, last night, what we talked about
It made so much sense
But now the haze has ascended
It don't make no sense anymore, oh

[Outro]
Da-da, da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da

[Spoken Intro]

[Verse 1]
Well, it's ever so funny
'Cause I don't think you're special, I don't think you're cool
You're just probably alright
But under these lights you look beautiful
And I'm struggling
I can't see through your fake tan
Yeah, and you know it for a fact
That everybody's eating out of your hands

[Chorus]
But what do you know?
Oh, you know nothing
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Said, you don't know nothing

[Verse 2]
Well, fancy seeing you in here
You're all tarted up and you don't look the same
Well, I haven't seen you since last year
Yeah, and surprisingly you have forgotten my name
But you know it
Yeah, and you knew it all along
Oh, and you say you have forgotten
But you're fibbing, go on, tell me I'm wrong

[Chorus]
So what do you know?
Oh, you know nothing
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Oh, you don't know nothing, no

[Bridge]
Oh-woah, woah, woah
Oh-woah, woah, woah
Da-da, da-da-da, da-da, da-da
Da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Oh-woah, woah, woah

[Chorus]
Oh, so what do you know?
Yeah, you don't know nothing, no
Yeah, but I'd still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home
I said, what do you know?
Oh, you don't know nothing

[Verse 3]
I fancy you with a passion
Oh, you're a Topshop princess, a rockstar too
But you're a fad and you're a fashion
And I'm having a job trying to talk to you
But it's alright
Yeah, I'll put it on one side
Oh, 'cause everybody's looking
You've got control of everyone's eyes, including mine

[Intro]
So up rolls a riot van
And sparks excitement in the boys
But the policemen look annoyed
Perhaps these are ones they should avoid

[Verse 1]
Got a chase last night
From men with truncheons dressed in hats
We didn't do that much wrong
Still ran away though, for the laugh
Just for the laugh
And please just stop talking
'Cause they won't find us if you do
Oh, those silly boys in blue
Well, they won't catch me and you

[Verse 2]
"Have you been drinking, son?
You don't look old enough to me"
"I'm sorry, officer
Is there a certain age you're supposed to be?
'Cause nobody told me"
And up rolls the riot van
And these lads just wind the coppers up
They ask why they don't catch proper crooks
They get their address and their names took
But they couldn't care less

[Outro]
Thrown in the riot van
And all the coppers kicked him in
And there was no way he could win
Just had to take it on the chin

[Verse 1]
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez
When it's Easter time too
And your gravity fails
And negativity don't pull you through
Don't put on any airs
When you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
They got some hungry women there
And they really make a mess outta you

[Verse 2]
Now if you see Saint Annie
Please tell her "Thanks a lot"
I cannot move
My fingers are all in a knot
I don't have the strength
To get up and take another shot
And my best friend, my doctor
Won't even say what it is I've got

[Verse 3]
Sweet Melinda
The peasants call her the Goddess of Gloom
She speaks good English
And she invites you up into her room
And you're so kind
And careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice
And leaves you howling at the moon

[Verse 4]
Up on Housing Project Hill
It's either fortune or fame
You must pick one or the other
Though neither of them are to be what they claim
If you're lookin' to get silly
You better go back to from where you came
Because the cops don't need you
And man, they expect the same

[Verse 5]
Now all the authorities
They just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the Sergeant-at-Arms
Into leaving his post
And picking up Angel
Who just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first
But left lookin' just like a ghost

[Verse 6]
I started out on Burgundy
But soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me
When the game got rough
But the joke was on me
There was nobody even there to bluff
I'm going back to New York City
I do believe I've had enough

[Verse 1]
My my, hey hey
Rock and roll is here to stay
It's better to burn out than to fade away
My my, hey hey

[Verse 2]
Out of the blue and into the black
They give you this, but you pay for that
And once you're gone you can never come back
When you're out of the blue and into the black

[Verse 3]
The king is gone but he's not forgotten
This is the story of a Johnny Rotten
It's better to burn out than it is to rust
The king is gone but he's not forgotten

[Verse 4]
Hey hey, my my
Rock and roll can never die
There's more to the picture than meets the eye
Hey hey, my my

[Harmonica Solo]

[Outro]
Hey hey, my my
Mmmm Yeah
A butterfly floats on the breeze of a sun lit day
As I feel this reality gently fade away
Riding on a thought to see where it's from
Gliding through a memory of a time yet to come
Smoke paints the air
Swirling images through my mind
Like a whirlpool spin beginning to unwind
And I stand at the edge, cautiously awaiting
As time slips by
Carefully navigating by the stars in the sky
And I sit
And I think to myself
And on the horizon, the sun light begins to climb
And it seems like it's been so long since he shined
But I'm sure it was only yesterday

A cold chill of fear cut through me
I felt my heart contract
To my mind I brought the image of light
And I expanded out of it
My fear was just a shadow
And then a voice spoke in my head
And she said, Dark is not the opposite of light
It's the absence of light
And I thought to myself
She knows what she's talking about
And for a moment I knew what it was all about

[Intro]
Look (Ooh)
I know we've been friends for a while now (Hey, hey)
But, I just feel like I can confess to you (Na-na-na-na-na, yeah)
It's gon' be hard but (Oh)
Alright, here it goes

[Verse 1]
Imagine that the pillow that you cried on was my chest
And the tissue that you wiped your face with was my hand
Girl, imagine if you needed advice about some other guy
I'm the one that comes to mind
Not tryna hear you tell nobody that I'm just a friend
Just tryna make sure I'm that body that you call your man
And any time you need a shoulder
It's yours, night or day, but what I'm tryna say is

[Chorus]
I wanna be the last number you call late at night (Said I wanna be)
First one that you dial when you open your eyes
Wanna be the one you run to
Wanna be the one that ain't gon' hurt you
I wanna be, yeah, wanna be, yeah
Be the man making your girls jealous (Girl, I wanna be)
Be the guy shutting down all the fellas (Oh)
Whatever you need, girl, it's all on me
Your soldier, your friend or your lover (Oh), girl, I wanna be

[Verse 2]
Would it be cool, would you mind if I called you my boo?
What if the next whip you was pushing was the one I bought for you?
Can I be the one that meets your pops and take your mama shopping?
Be the only one they like
Wait, have you thought about it
Wait, really thought about it?
Maybe you should take some time
Call your girls and talk about it, yeah
'Cause I done already made up my mind (My mind)
Don't need no more time to know if I wanna be with you

[Chorus]
I wanna be the last number you call late at night (Yeah, I wanna be, yeah)
First one that you dial when you open your eyes (Oh)
Wanna be the one you run to (Wanna be that)
Wanna be the one that ain't gon' hurt you (Wanna be that)
I wanna be, yeah, wanna be, yeah
Be the man making your girls jealous (I wanna)
Be the guy shutting down all the fellas (All the fellas, yeah)
Whatever you need (Whatever you need), girl, it's all on me
Your soldier, your friend or your lover (Hey), girl, I wanna be

[Bridge]
Put me on your screen saver, all over your MySpace
And make me one of your top favorites, that's where I wanna be
The one you crying for, stand up for and fighting for
Wanna be your good, bad, love, hate, girl
Cross my heart, hope to die, on everything that's good
I'ma do you right, show you right, get this understood
Cross my heart, hope to die, on everything that's good
I'ma do you right, show you right, get this understood

[Chorus]
I wanna be the last number you call late at night (Oh, oh)
First one that you dial when you open your eyes (When you open your eyes)
Wanna be the one you run to
Wanna be the one that ain't gon' hurt you (Oh)
I wanna be, yeah (I wanna be yours), wanna be, yeah
Be the man making your girls jealous (Jealous, yeah)
Be the guy shutting down all the fellas (Fellas)
Whatever you need (Oh), girl, it's all on me
Your soldier, your friend or your lover, girl, I wanna be

[Outro]
Oh, I wanna be yours
Girl, I wanna be yours
I wanna be yours
Be yours
I wanna be, be yours
I wanna be, be yours

[Verse 1]
I can think of younger days when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
I was never told about the sorrow

[Chorus]
And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
Tell me, how can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go 'round?

[Verse 2]
And how can you mend this broken man? Yeah
How can a loser ever win?
Somebody please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again, la-la, la-la, la

[Verse 3]
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
But we could never see tomorrow
Would you believe that no one, no one ever told us about the sorrow?

[Chorus]
So how can you mend a broken heart? And mine is
How can you stop the rain from falling down? Baby
How can you stop that old sun from shining?
What makes the world go round? And sometime I have to say, yeah, say

[Bridge]
La-la-la, la-la-la, uh-huh, yeah
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, tell me
Help me mend my, my broken heart
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna live again, baby
How can you mend this broken man? Yeah, somebody tell me
How can a loser ever win? 'Cause, baby
Help me mend my— this old broken heart
I think I, I believe I
I feel like I got to, I feel like I wanna live again

[Chorus]
How can you mend this broken heart? Somebody, please, tell me
How can you stop the rain from falling down? I know my my clothes are all wet, tell me
How can you mend my, please help me mend my broken heart
I think I, I believe I, I've got a feeling that I want to live and live and live

[Outro]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la
La, yeah

[Spoken Intro]
"Shall I keep rolling?"

[Verse 1]
Well, oh, they might wear classic Reeboks
Or knackered Converse, or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
But all of that's what the point is not
The point's that there in't no romance around there
And there's the truth that they can't see
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
And if you could only see 'em then you would agree
Agree that there in't no romance around there

[Chorus]
You know? Oh, it's a funny thing, you know
We'll tell 'em if you like, we'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen, because their minds are made up
And course it's all okay to carry on that way

[Verse 2]
'Cause over there there's broken bones
There's only music so that there's new ringtones
And it dun't take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here
Don't get me wrong though, there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just 'cause he's had a couple of cans
He thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead

[Chorus]
Don't you know? Oh, it's a funny thing, you know
We'll tell 'em if you like, we'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen, because their minds are made up
And course it's all okay to carry on that way

[Bridge]
But I said no, oh no
Well, you won't get me to go
Not anywhere, not anywhere
No, I won't go
Oh, no, no

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
But over there, there's friends of mine
What can I say? I've known 'em for a long long time
And they might overstep the line
But you just cannot get angry in the same way
No, not in the same way
Said, not in the same way
Oh no, oh no, no

[Intro]

Hey there pretty lady, saw you at the bar and I was mesmerized
You might think it sounds crazy, but I ain't never been a man to lie

Now, today, tomorrow, and always
My only weakness is a listed crime

Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Hand it over, hand it over, hand it over

Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Hand it over, hand it over, hand it over

[Bridge]
A heartless hand on my shoulder
A push and it's over
Alabaster crashes down (six months is a long time)
Tried living in the real world instead of a shell
But before I began...
I was bored before I even began

[Chorus 2]
Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Take over

They murked your homeboy that was cold blooded

Never seen a nigga make this much money

[Verse 1] Gucci Mane

And everyday he thank the lord he alive

[Chours]
They murked your homeboy that was cold blooded

Ghost Thang on the feet Quarter key for the shoes
Ten bands for your life, Five hundred on the tool
That's a throw away, Bitch I'm bout to take these hoes to school
That's a murder weapon throw it in the river when you through
On my young nigga shit, in my old school reppin'
With my hat to the back, with my fully loaded weapon
Tried to re-up in my hood, I'mma teach yo ass a lesson
Fresh off a million dollar run, that's what I call a blessing
Bitch I'm cool with the bank owner fucking on the bank teller
Ten figure nigga hood rich, I can buy whatever
But I remember them days when I was starvin'
Like you remember them days when I was robbin'

She's my everything, like a morning girl
She's my angel, up above my world
She's the only one, who understands me
That's why I call her, my new family

[Hook]
She's the only one that I want by my side
She's the only one that I believe can save my life
She makes me wanna be a better man ohh why
She's higher then the sky, the suns and the moon

[Chorus]
She's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby) 

[x4]

[Verse 2]
First let me say, she's the best of me
Is it cliche, to say she's destiny
There's no one else but her, well at least for me
That's exactly why, I must now repeat

[Hook]
She's the only one that I want by my side
She's the only one that I believe can save my life
She makes me wanna be a better man ohh why
She's higher then the sky, the suns and the moon

[Chorus]
She's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby) 

[x4]

[Bridge]
She's my star, my light, starry night
Aviator shades, cause she shine so bright
Beats on the G5, songs I write
Just so I can take her on a G5 flights
Ya she my type, just my height
She's my fit, she's just right
She's like, “I think we might, go far”, I'm like, “you right”
She could be my angel wings, her voice sounds like an angel sings
Ya I'll be back with the trademark strings
Just try to compliment the sounds she brings
She's like, “We could go far”, I'm like, “you you you are”. I'm like, “you you you are”
You are, my guiding star

[Hook]
She's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby) 

[x4]
Let me start by saying I feel like an asshole right now, but a tough decision had to be made in regard to my schedule over the next few months. The casualties of that decision include my appearances at upcoming festivals in Europe and my opening slot on the European leg of the Coldplay world tour. Sorry as fuck, I'll be back if you'll have me

[Verse 1: King Chip]
I'm just what you made God — not many I trust
I'ma go my own way God, take my fate to wherever you want
I'm out here, on my son, won't stop 'til I get me some
Club-hoppin', tryna get me some, bad bitches wanna get me sprung
Early in the morning, I'm wakin', bakin', drinkin', contemplatin'
Ain't no such thing as Satan, evil is what you make it
Thank the Lord for that burning bush
That big body Benz I was born to push
On my way I'm burning kush, nigga don't be worried 'bout us
Neighbors knockin' on the door, asking can we turn it down
I say, "Ain't no music on", she said, "No, that weed is loud"
Nigga, we ballin', straight swaggin', lost Hawk, but I'm maintainin'
I've been told that I'm amazing, make sure keep that fire blazin', we livin'

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I need smoke
I need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?

[Post-Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I'm just what you made God, just what you made God (Nee-need it)
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made
(Nee-need it) I'm just what you made God
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made God

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Let me tell you ‘bout my month y'all, in the shop and I had a ball
I had to ball for therapy, my shrink don’t think that helps at all
Whatever, that man ain’t wearing these leather pants
I diagnose my damn self, these damn pills ain’t working fam
I- In my spare time, punching walls, fucking up my hand
I know that shit sound super cray but if you had my life you’d understand
But, I can’t fold, some poor soul got it way worse
We’re all troubled, in a world in trouble
It’s scary to have a kid walk this Earth
I’m what you made God, fuck yes I’m so odd
Thinking 'bout all my old friends who weren’t my friends all along
Hm, when it rains it pours, whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors
Everyday to find sane’s a chore, amidst a dream with no exit doors

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I need smoke
I need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?

[Post-Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I'm just what you made God, just what you made God (Nee-need it)
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made
(Nee-need it) I'm just what you made God
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made God

[Outro]
Need it to get by, ya
Willy
(Verse 1)

I said shawty mind clear with the jewels drippin' off em
She say I be killin' em
I say get a coffin
Stuntin I be often
They like "What it cost him?"
Whole team fulla green you would think we Boston
Swollen, Ballin
Flow be on the faucet
Middle man shut yo damn mouth call a boss in
Big money on the table nigga why you talkin
Black and yellow 'maro, murder scene, caution
Tape, scrape, all I get is hate
Chillin' in the mansion, all you see is gate
She say that I'm handsome she thinking 'bout a date
But I'm just tryna take her home I'm thinking bout a "safe"
I was just booked they had me bidding in the pen house
Couple months later now I'm sittin in the penthouse
Bitches fuckin' everywhere you thinking it's a pimphouse
Engineer lookin' when that boy gon' pull his pen out
No pen no pad
This shit so sad
Dippin in the Aston
This bitch so fast
This bitch so bad
I treat her so nice
I came so fast
I had to go twice
Rob me, no dice
Better get your dope slice
Puffin on the diesel gettin higher than the coke price
Nigga, you a rat, you a talkin to them folks type
I'm more like the bull that could get 'em by the bow type
This be- homicide
All black whipped you would think it's on my side
I'mma get money laid back kinda guy
If you dead broke, nigga why you mindin mine?
Yah, you gettin paid for this shit?
I dont needa see the work I'm gettin paid by the bricks
Ciroc and lemonade in the shade with your bitch
She sent you straight to the voicemail
Shame on your bitch
(Chorus)
You wussup girl
I gotta ask you
If you suckin would you eat the nut?
Cashews
I'm countin money so you know I'm good at math boo
She frontin' on you tryna cover up yo' tattoos
Girl why you killin him?
She tryna go at me
I'm tellin' her to deal with him
And if you notice me
Then you will see some will in him
Rocks in the bezzle
Bigger then some M&m's, HA!

(Verse 2)

High school I was ballin, Reese Rice
....................................
I hustle all day I don't even eat right
Cause Im just tryna get a ticket no police light
That's a milli bitch
I'm on that Philly shit
And I'm just tryna make a movie like I'm Willy Smith
Come to my hood, show you how real it gets
Niggas thats padlocked tell you that they feelin this
(Outro)

It's Meek Milli bitch!
Philly!
I swear to god
Ain't no competion and I dont even own a composition
You wassup girl, I gotta ask you, if you suckin
Would you eat the nut?
Cashews! Haha!
Real talk though, no pen no pad flow
Shit is so sad tho
It's your boy Meek Milli signin' the fuck out
We make movies- bitch!

[Intro]
Uh, this is for my
This is for my, one love, one love

[Verse 1]
I had a dream when I was just a little boy
To find a girl like you
We would meet at the park after school
And talk 'til the day was through
Then, you take me to your parent's house
And I would comb your hair
And we would dream of all the cities
And places we could go
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Say the words that you know I wanna hear
Put your heart up close to my ear
We don't need to know the time
We could stay 'til the day turns to night

[Verse 2]
I can still remember dreams as a little boy
Now, I’m a man and still can't put down my toys
(Hey, hey, hey)
Real love will never come if you in it now
But I had to learn that lesson down in the south
Back to spending nights on the town, just to have a little fun
In my mind, I'm wishing she’s the one (I said to myself)
Is this too close to reality
For you to be that girl from my fantasy?

[Chorus]
Say the words that you know I wanna hear
Put your heart up close to my ear
We don't need to know the time
We could stay 'til the day turns to night

[Bridge]
She stole my head and let’s go play the dream again
To find a girl like you (only you and me around)
I look into your eyes
And I see our universe (you and I are intertwined)
I look into your eyes
And I see our universe (love is pure, so divine)

[Chorus]
Say the words that you know I wanna hear
Put your heart up close to my ear
We don't need to know the time
We could stay 'til the day turns to night
Say the words that you know I wanna hear
Put your heart up close to my ear
We don't need to know the time
We could stay 'til the day turns to night

[Outro]
This is dedicated
From the fire, we'll rise
To my one and only ever love
I would never, ever, ever, ever love again
This is dedicated (you know who you are)
To my one and only ever love (the only girl I've ever loved)
Make it happen, we can make it happen
Make it happen, we can make it happen
Make it happen, we can make it happen
Make it happen, we can make it happen
Let's go

Wheel up, back up, rewind

Happen, we can make it happen
Make it happen, we can make it happen
Happen, we can make it happen
Make it happen, we can make it happen
Happen, we can make it happen
Make it happen, we can make it happen
Uh-huh

Huh

Don't slow down now
Don't stop listening
It's the reason we can ??
Uh-huh
Happen, we can make it happen
Happen, we can make it happen
Make it happen, we can make it happen
Make it happen, we can make it happen

Ditty-ditty-ditty-ditty-dum
Ditty-ditty-ditty-ditty-dum
You don't stop
Don't stop
That's right, you don't stop rockin' the beat
New York City

Now it's suffice to say that I'm nicer
Nice in the cut and, yes, I'm the slicer
Or should I say I'm the filleter
I hate the game, I hate the player
But don't get discombobulated and upset
Because trust me, we ain't even begun yet

Mike D's got it locked and we rock it nonstop
Adrock's got it locked and we rock it nonstop
MCA's got it locked and we rock it nonstop
And you don't stop, the body rock

Watch me make it pop, now I make it sizzle
As I flip your omelet at the b bizzle
I'm like Molto Mario, they call me Tasty D
Your quick fire challenge, freak the hijiki
You can call me chef cause it's bonafide
Knife skills on the block that I'm taking worldwide
Mike D got it locked and we rock it nonstop
Adrock got it locked and we rock it nonstop
MCA got it locked and we rock it nonstop
And then you don't stop, the body rock

I've got bass lines bubbling up on out of my hands
Don't want to never play nothin' that sounds too bland
Shazam! I sprinkle on some magic dust
You've got a bagel in your pants and that's a must
Plus I cuss and I grab my nuts
Got a six finger ring that says "excuse our dust"

Mike D's got it locked and we rock it nonstop
Adrock's got it locked and we rock it nonstop
MCA's got it locked and we rock it nonstop
And you don't stop, the body rock

Sometimes things just don't connect
On and on to the break of dawn
On and on to the break of dawn
On and on to the break of dawn
On and on to the break of dawn

Now let me introduce myself, I'm Adrock
No matter what you order, well, I got it in stock
The doody rhyme thing, well, we got it on lock
Top off the look with the Argyle sock

Take it from me now, I'm gonna give it all I got
I take a licking, still tick-tick-tock
Smoked salmon, ain't old school lox
I go to Peter Brady and I buy Greg's sox

It's Mike on the mic and I'm known to please
Stinky nasty like the head cheese
Caps, gowns, honorary degrees
Rhymes fresh pressed like '83 Lees

You can't stop, you got to keep on
You can't stop, you got to keep on
I mean that's all I got, except I've just got...
Even Michael Diamond him never learn
Atop him head, him have a curly perm

Tissue up my nose and my dick's in a cast
I don't wanna talk about it, past is past
All you crusty punks that are into Crass
Go and take a shower and wash that ass

We rock nonstop here in New York City
Sweet on the mic, looking so damn pretty
Served by me, well, it must feel shitty
Weird thing to say here, it goes tough titty

I've got rhymes in a pitcher and it's time to pour
I'm at the tee and I'm screaming "Fore!"
Hit into your party as I declare war
Roberta Peterson's got a spine like a dinosaur

You can't stop, you got to keep on
You can't stop, you got to keep on
You can't stop, you got to keep on

On and on to the break of dawn

Brass monkey, you're the funky
Brass monkey, you're the funky
Brass monkey, you're the funky
Brass monkey, you're the funky monkey
Awww, shit

Whoa, what?

Front (front), back (back)

[Verse 1]
Well, now then, mardy bum
I've seen your frown and it's like looking down
The barrel of a gun, and it goes off
And out come all these words
Oh, there's a very pleasant side to you
A side I much prefer

[Chorus]
It's one that laughs and jokes around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was up, up, and away
Ah, but it's reight hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

[Verse 2]
Well, now then mardy bum
Oh, I'm in trouble again, aren't I?
I thought as much
'Cause you turned over there
Pulling that silent disappointment face
The one that I can't bear

[Chorus]
Well, can't we just laugh and joke around?
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was up, up, and away
Ah, but it's reight hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

[Bridge]
And yeah, I'm sorry I was late
But I missed the train and then the traffic was a state
And I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate that reoccurs
Oh, when you say I don't care
But, of course I do, yeah, I clearly do

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
So laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was up, up, and away
Oh, but it's reight hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

[Verse 1]
Leaving town I found a flower that I could deserve
Someone moves and someone's bound to get their feelings hurt
I'm loving you, you're out of range
Wanted you, you're out of range

As I walked out into a world I feel a sudden chill
I was bleeding pretty good onto a daffodil
Loving you, you're out of range
Wanted to, you're out of range

[Chorus]
I don't want too much more than
Than to be reborn in
The morning
Reborn so I can feel you
The thorns of bugambilia
I feel you

[Verse 2]
I have your number and I dial it up a hundred times
Barely there, your voice is cracking up across state lines
I'm loving you, you're out of range
Wanted you, you're out of range
Skies of ecstasy were breaking while I do believe
The tears of God were falling down upon my swollen cheeks
Loving you, you're out of range
Wanted to, you're out of range

[Chorus]
I don't want too much more than
Than to be reborn in
The morning
Reborn so I can feel you
The thorns of bugambilia
I feel you

[Instrumental Solo]

[Bridge]
I know it hurts when it's taken away
I tell you that I could be living
Today with you or without you okay
Washed by the rain and it's all gonna change

[Chorus]
I don't want too much more than
Than to be reborn in
The morning
Reborn so I can feel you
The thorns of bugambilia
I feel you
No sir, not too much more than
Than to be reborn in
The morning
Reborn so I can feel you
The thorns of bugambilia
I feel you

[Verse 1: Beanie Sigel]
Yea, when I cop it's 4 doors I'm too big for a coup nigga
An when I go to war I don't get shot I just shoot niggas
An I don't trust a nigga as far as I can throw 'em
Even though I'm feeling strong enough I probably can roof niggas
Yea, your boy back in the booth nigga
I'm off the weed but I'm back on my juice nigga
I beat the case so its off with the suits
Back to Fatigues, black tee’s and Timbaland boots nigga
The year is new, I want my spot back take two
Matter fact take the whole click who you know can fly by in the 05-06
When they see that new V the dope boys go crazy
You know I still fuck with State P still fuck wit Dame Dash still fuck wit Jay-Z
Still real steel still recognize real I still feel it in the air
We kill at will here

[Hook: Beanie Sigel]
First Pac got got, Then B.I.G. clock stopped
Now somethin' going on with the Roc
I'm hearin shit about a break up, the shit people make up
I'm like "Damn when will it stop?"
Jay and Dame ain't speakin, Game and 50 Cent beefing and Cease got Lil Kim knocked?
I'm hearin all this in the jail while I'm sittin in my cell
An I'm waitin on some mail from the Prop

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo you gotta hole in you and you bleeding
So its not like I'm just callin you "Pussy" for no reason
Me? I'm a bastard I hit the blunts till I gotta cough then I pass em
Exhaust on the Aston, that next choice you make might be your last one
Shit that I needed stuck with me from the classroom
Real talk now, who's the King of New York now?
Boys got safe in the house, I gotta vault now
From my old grams still, with my old fam still
Still gettin wireless head that's with no hands
Listen my grandma in compensation compares to yall's is way beyond exist-ions
D-Block daddy new black Caddy comin through knockin Micheal McDonald and Patty
P's of haze is still going for 8 in the Nati
Rather have God arrest me then Satan to bag me
I'll gladly involve ya moms, Al-Quada Jada I'm only involved with bombs
Put my life on it
Soon as you put in the hot water all you gotta do is put the ice on it
I been givin to niggas for years I'm responsible for niggas careers muthafucka!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
Hold ya head up Cass don't stress wait a come on fast

And I been focusin' to never leave you alone again (Okay)

[Verse 2]
Somethin' 'bout the way you cooler than a motherfuckin' ice rack
Got me mad when I leave but, baby, I'll be right back (Back)
She don't like that, askin' me for more
Or mad about it like she been askin' me before
And she sayin' that I ignore her, all I care about is work (I don't know)
I say it's what I do and try not to be a jerk (Be a jerk)
She give a smirk, knowin' how it be
Go to kiss up on her lips, but she turn and get a cheek
'Cause she all about the slow seduction (Right?)
No rushin', total crushin'
We been up, haven't gone to sleep in weeks (Sleep in weeks)
I know what you sayin', you don't need to speak (To speak)
But call me Mr. Make You Sweat
In the mornin', turn myself to Mr. Make a Check (Let's go)

Better together than givin' it up (Oh)
'Member you can never miss me enough
Whenever I'm back, I'm hittin' you up ('Sup?)

[Outro]
Now ladies, if ya man ain't treatin' ya right
You know who to call, I gotchu
The High Life, that's my life
But it could be yours
Said, it could be yours

[Hook]
You’re so professional
With yo 9 to 5, tryna make some revenue
Stand up five 'till five, looking straight incredible
But them guys be lying, really, they just scared of you
So girl I’m telling you
Well, give it to me right now, I could do you so
And we can do it right now, like we’re all alone
And I know you’re waiting to, do the things we’re made to do
What we’re made to do, we ain’t ashamed
So girl give it to me right now, you’re just like a pro

[Verse 1]
You know I am watching whenever you are on clock
I hope you never take a break I hope that you don’t stop
Imagination had me on the bottom, you on top
Every single time you break it down, you get ‘em
Every time you dress you’re blessed that is the best of death
I guess I’ll have to resurrect, they know you kill ‘em
Cooler than a cucumber, two thumbs up, put them up high
With high heels and you shoot on

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Yea, you’re doing it, doing it
You know just what to do with it, with that thang
You know you know just what to do with it, do with it
You know just what to do with it, with that thang
You know just what to do with that thing
You know I like the way you move with it, move with it
I like the way you move with it, with that thang
(You know) I like how you move with it, move with it
(You know) You're just like a pro (you know)

[Verse 2]
Ok, let me think, if I had a guess
I can tell by the way you type, I can tell by the way you dress
I can tell by the way you meet me, stacking papers across that desk
If you get down with a guy like me, you’ll be a veteran, you’ll be a vet
Light are off, now bring your waist to the edge of the bed
I heard your accident, you’re scratching and grabbing my neck
That is it, you know what I like
A business woman by day, foxy rentals by night

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I like the way you move with it (move with it)
I like the way you move with it, with that thang (with that thang)
I like the way you move with it, move with it, with that thang

[Hook]
So give it to me right now
I could use you so
And we can do it right now
Like we're all alone
And I know you’re waiting to
Do the things we’re made to do
What we’re made to do, we ain’t ashamed
So girl give it to me right now
You’re just like a pro

[Intro]
What it is, it's B.o.B., Bobby Ray
Mr. Eastside, Mr. StrangeClouds
I got my homie TJ’s DJs on the ones and the twos
This here is BET backroom exclusive freestyle
A-Town stand up, what up?

[Verse]
I put my CD on and I did it since the beginning
I pulled up to the table and helped myself to the fixes
I kicked it funky for you to break up the repetition
When they told me I never obtained what I once envisioned
Now with me in my position you welcome the competition
Honestly I’m alone in my league, in my own division
Hypocritical critics, all noticed but won’t admit it
They probably be just afraid of the change that I once presented
The duality I see in this game is a contradiction
All I can do is hope but the days I just can’t predict ‘em
The record young profane in this age is just so ridiculous
The population is stricken by fantasies of tuition
Me on the other hand, the plan was to be invidious
Never sacrifice myself for the plans of a politician
Stand in danger, just so close to the edge
They thought I’d end up in prison I’m on the poster instead
So hallelujah boy, that’s how I do it boy
I live a different lifestyle you ain’t used to, boy
Your girl got the type of mouth to whole crew enjoy
I’m on that loud-pack, call that the super noise
Strange Clouds, yo

[Hook]
It's so easy to fall in love

[Verse 1]
Purple kisses on your neck, thinking 'bout the day we met
Body dripping sweat, eat that, beat that pussy wet
Purple silhouettes, purple drank and cigarettes
She is my addiction, nigga need a Nicorette
Trill-ass misses, fuck her where a nigga rest
A$AP tat cause that's what a nigga rep
Style fresh to death, show you bitches how to flaunt
And the Yves St. Laurent, or her Isabel Marant
Like when Jay Z out, tryna take B out
All these magazines try to play me out
All my ex-girls tryna fade me out
By the ending I was finished, so it's crazy how

[Hook]
It's so easy to fall in love

[Verse 2]
Okay wait, now hold up, let me switch that flow up
Call her to come over and you just try to control her
Ever since I growed up, I been got my dough up
Now I'm smoking more blunts and I'm sipping 'til I'm poured up
Tore up from the floor up, tore down from my toes up
Get throwed 'til I throw up, but I'm pimping like I'm 'sposed to
Got the illest chocha, reason why I chose her
Mami is a rider and see me I be that roller
She hate a rap nigga walking with his nose up
She date a rap nigga walking with his toaster
So take your picture, get your close-up
Another fake imitation, just a poser on a poster
I did it again for my culture
Went Testarossa, traded it in for a Rover
Just to get in and get chauffeured
Driver pull over, tipping and picking these hoes up
I'm slipping from feeling this sober
Window is rolled up, this purple kissed on my shoulder
Undress and I sex and I hold her
Caressing her breast with my head on her chest I'm all on her

[Hook]
It's so easy to fall in love

[Verse 1]
When you walk without ease
On these
Streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
It lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
I never, I'm alone

[Chorus]
And I never, ever oh...
Had no one ever

[Verse 2]
Now I'm outside your house
I'm alone
And I'm outside your house
I hate to intrude ...
Oh, alone, I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone

[Chorus]
And I never, never ... oh ... had no one ever
I never had no one ever
I never had no, no one ever
Had no one ever
Never... no...
Oh...

[Hook: Bilal]
You shine like the lights of Las Vegas
You feel way beyond outrageous
You're confidence and appeal, so sexual
How dare you? How dare you? How dare you?
How dare you come do me like that that

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I got my eyes on like the fire zone
Let's be bygones
Won't you come and be a line in one of my songs?
Maybe a whole verse, baby the whole Earth’s my home
So let me show you around the crib
Tell you what I do, and show you what I did
Flow is on the stove, I'm cooking for the kids
Wrist is in the freezer, heart is in the fridge
But we can warm it up, plug the Foreman up
Open the oven door, turn the saunas up
Stretch the Benz out, if it ain't long enough
Get lost in the feeling, be no longer us
Hop up out the coupe, hop up on the bus
Give you 'get to the backs', code name for Rosa's sons
We're in a better place, give us condolences
This like a player's mate, and like a coma love

[Hook: Bilal]
You shine like the lights of Las Vegas
You feel way beyond outrageous
You're confidence and appeal, so sexual
How dare you? How dare you? How dare you?
How dare you come do me like that that

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
And I hope it's all up to your standards
Cause babies really need to be pampered
I'm behind these tents like a camper
Cause you're out there shining like chandler
Like a chandelier standing near in your radiance
I think we all need some shadiness
Or some vision care, oh no, you didn't dare
While I sitting here like Huey in his wicker chair
You know that isn't fair, how you just entered here
Getting their hopes up, that they can interfere
You're so insincere, you know I got you
Have you looked in the mirror? You know that's not cool

[Hook: Bilal]
You shine like the lights of Las Vegas
You feel way beyond outrageous
You're confidence and appeal, so sexual
How dare you? How dare you? How dare you?
How dare you come do me like that that

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Let's have a cease fire, be some peace tryers
Let's negotiate, because my cheeks tired
From smiling all day
Emotions need a motrin, a tylenol break
I know you see my strategy, if flattery's a battery
Then I'm a rabbit with a pack of 'D's in back of me
Pause on all levels, everybody settle
I know it sounded weird, I'm just trying to impress you
And step forward with my best two
If all that fails, hope it’s swag to the rescue
I said swag, and I'm sorry
Don't mean to offend your sensibilities I meant dress smartly
Just trying to get you out this party
Can you dig that? Ologist-Archae
Please be the Ferrari to my car key
And I'mma hold my baby down like a car seat

[Bridge: Bilal]
You know what you're doing to me
You got that firepower, baby
I just can't get enough
No, I can't get enough

[Hook: Bilal]
You shine like the lights of Las Vegas
You feel way beyond outrageous
You're confidence and appeal, so sexual
How dare you? How dare you? How dare you?
How dare you come do me like that that

[Verse 1]
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If'n you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do somehow
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on
But don't think twice, it's all right

[Verse 2]
And it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe
The light I never knowed
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
But we never did too much talking anyway
But don't think twice, it's all right

[Verse 3]
So it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you never done before
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
I can't hear you anymore
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child, I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right

[Verse 4]
So long, honey babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
Goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I'll just say, "Fare thee well"
I ain't a-saying you treated me unkind
You could've done better, but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right

[Intro]
K.E. on the Track

[Verse 1]
Okay, I walked inside the club with my golds on (Golds on)
These bitches in my V.I.P., you know what goes on (Goes on)
You got me 'bout to take my shirt off, she rollin' tryna party
She said she wanted a threesome, and then I meet her girl named Molly
I said, "Oh no, woah woah, damn damn, oh oh"
Her jaw locked, when my balls dropped then she really started to chow down
Her head game is the meanest, it make me a paraplegic
That pill kicked in like 30 minutes, she start havin' a seizure
So what nigga, you gotta attitude, fuck you and your demeanor
I'm partyin' to death, I make a mess, you gotta clean up
Oh my bad 'cause I'm actin' like a peanut
All you see at the top in V.I.P. is these nuts

[Chorus]
I'm gettin' money, what's a stack?
You see me gettin' money, what's a stack?
Been gettin' money, what's a stack?
Let me show you how a real nigga throw these racks (Racks)
Throw these racks (Racks)
Real nigga throw these racks (Racks)
Throw these racks (Hahaha)
Real nigga throw these racks

[Verse 2]
Okay, I'm outside, niggas hatin', they tried to key my car
They done fucked 'round, made me mad, I'm about to buy the bar
Order more shots, more liquor, more hoes, no niggas
Sneak all 'em in the back door, they packed on pack, they rollin' with us
Damn, my chain might glitter, this boy be from Virginia
And she tell your ass to stop but she don't say that when I'm in her
Haha 'cause I-hi, I kick that shit, my ninja
My Cartier is winter, your shawty is my dinner
I met a bad bitch at the Starbucks
Straight to the telly, that's a star fuck
Tens, fifties and them hunnids
I ain't talkin' numbers, bitch, I'm talkin' money

[Chorus]
I'm gettin' money, what's a stack?
You see me gettin' money, what's a stack?
Been gettin' money, what's a stack?
Let me show you how a real nigga throw these racks (Racks)
Throw these racks (Racks)
Real nigga throw these racks (Racks)
Throw these racks (Haha, yeah)
Real nigga throw these racks

[Verse 3]
Look, let me stop the talkin', gon' and pop that shit for daddy
A nigga got his money up, you know I gotta live it up and all my money stacked in my attic
A little belligerent, I'm crazy, *cough*, I'm coughin' like an asthmatic
And niggas claimin' they bad but bitch nigga, you know I'm the baddest
Shake it, shake it, shake it in my face
Give a damn about your name but I care about your waist, ha
Naked, naked, girl, I want your birthday cake
Fuck you talkin' 'bout celibate, we gon' celebrate

[Chorus]
I'm gettin' money, what's a stack?
You see me gettin' money, what's a stack?
Been gettin' money, what's a stack?
Let me show you how a real nigga throw these racks (Racks)
Throw these racks (Racks)
Real nigga throw these racks (Racks)
Throw these racks (Racks)
Real nigga throw these racks

[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together
Like, ever

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We (We) are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me) But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, "Never say never"
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you"
And I'm like, "I just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever"

[Chorus]
(No) We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (Ooh) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

[Outro]
We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)
Getting back together
We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
Getting back together (Yeah)
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me) But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

[Intro]
Hahahahahah

Drop the top, nigga
Fuck it, roll the windows down

In places you won't go
You movin in slowmo

Addicted since I fell for gettin this cash, like
You don't need to ask twice
You heard of the young guy
Started off small time
Now I'm alumni
Because I'm young fly (young fly)
Dumb high (dumb high)
And a flow like mine ain't easy to come by
I'm over to Cali, watching the sunrise
A meeting in New York, I'll be there by lunchtime
Then fly to Miami for the end of the night, done
If I ain't a star well then I'm livin just like one
I'm feeling just like, um, my life may be too good
So I keep it too real, god made me too hood

No, I don't know what you into
Made it to the top after all I done been through
I'm sharp as a Ginsu
You won't find shit that the kid got on
At any mall that you been to
Call him official
Or maybe exclusive
It ain't nothing major
It's just how I do shit
Ain't nothing but new shit
New Era, new fit
In a new town tryna fuck with a new bitch
I'm in something roofless
You know I ain't easy
But that's how I got it

It's more like a movie
Niggas might've heard that I came up, it's true, we

Thought we brought enough with us
We gon' need mo' trees
Some niggas be low-key
But fuck it I'm flashy
My bros are expensive
My bitches are classy
I live for the moment
But then let it pass me
(Ah, never that)
This what I say when they ask me
(Man they walk up to me, I be like)

[Bridge 1]
I really want to live in the fast lane
I grind and I did it all my way
Now that it's over

I feel so close to you right now

Ear Drummers
Mike WiLL Made-It

[Verse 1]
I am sippin' on that lean, don't bring me no bottles, ho
I make it rain so hard, flowers grow, Hollygrove
Four baby mamas, no baby mama drama
Bad bitch at home sleep, I go home and sleep behind her, uh
Shout out to my weed man, shout out to my lean man
I'm sittin' on these motherfuckin' millions like a beanbag
Fuck you, don't judge me, drug me then love me
Eat me some pussy when I got the munchies
I'm tripping, tell Pippen to beam me up, Scotty
Got pounds of that kush watch me go on a diet
That's no lie, I'm so hot, you pussy ass niggas Massengill
I got them yellow Xanax, I slipped on a banana peel
Trukfit T-shirt, blunt dipped in syrup
Pass that weed around like some fuckin' hors d'oeuvres
Man I'm shit faced and your bitch facin', she high too, fuckin' right
My number one F-A-N, you know what that mean, Fuck All Night, uh

[Break]
Yeah, I'ma let that breathe
Let that breathe

[Verse 2]
Uh, nigga I fucked that bitch that's with ya
And she send me naked pictures
If I was you I wouldn't kiss her, you know why?
You know why, yeah, uh, now all my bad bitches say word
You ain't never jocked no nigga, you ain't never sweat no nigga
Yeah, you don't want none of these niggas
Bitch, I ain't one of these niggas, ho
I be doin' my own thing, red bone with a tongue-ring
We get home and she go straight for that head, gun range
Fuck your feelings I'm feelin' me, you want real? That's real as me
Mask on, trick-or-treat, my sign say "Dick for free"
All my homies ride or die, all my bitches ride or die
I look her pussy eye-to-eye then suck that motherfucker dry

[Outro]
Yes Lord
Yeah and she say, "Yes Lord"
Yeah, Dedication 4, ho
Scoob in this bitch with me?

[Verse 1]
I daydream pretty women out in Beijing
Paris Celine hop up in that Saline
I chase dreams, white man but the face green
Same thing err' day, err' thing gleam
Fuck my reply, the bank do the statements
Had me with my savings, I was saving in my savings
Two or three bedroom shack I was raised in
The condos out in Jersey full of Jay West paintings
Talk to the boy how you talk to the Lord
Talk to these broads how I talk to my dog
Marc Jacob plates, Margiela rugs
My boys make smores out you marshmallow thugs
Hop up out the first class, hop into that E-class
Cut raw, cut school, I ain't ever see class
If so, I was cutting in my nigga Steve's class
School of hard knocks, graduated with a G pass
G-Code, street code, fake niggas; cheat code
Niggas trying to turn fake shit: green, cheap gold
I don't know how they do it for the freak show
But I ain't even go beast mode
So we toast

[Verse 2]
Fuck the pearly gates, I'm hanging by the steps
'Cause my target is my goal and I'm aiming for the best
I'm good at what I do, but I'm coming for the best spot
On the road to greatness, success is the next stop
I don't even rest, (Nah) even at a rest stop
I toast with the Gods, tell these haters take they best shot
I'ma be that motherfucker 'til my breath stop
I guess for now call me step pop

[Verse 3]
We toast for the night and drink for the day
The God shed a tear providing us rain
What a shame from the pain 'cause we used to being slaves
Made a change from the whips, shackles and the chains
But nowadays man seem a little strange
Trade his soul for the whips and the chains, what a change!
No, I couldn't tell you what the difference is
But I could tell you what the business is
I was getting dividends, probably spending Benjamins
Both kind of synonyms, in the same sentences
Tell me what a good Christian is
Better yet; when Christmas is
Waiting on my presence, I must be a gift from heaven
'Cause I'm toasting with the Lord, somebody let the bitches in

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
DJ Khaled! Terror Squad!
And he goes by the name of...
Listennn!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
You got the right one (Yeah), it's Weezy Fuckin' Baby (Yeah)

[Chorus: Paul Wall]
Hanh, holla at me, what it do, what it is
You ain't never seen a playa like this (Holla at me, baby)
I'ma pimp her, I'll show her how I live
Take her back, then I put it in her ribs (Holla at me, baby)
I'm a monster, I do it real big
You ain't never seen rocks like this (Holla at me, baby)
You can see it from afar, I'm the shit
Scream at me, what it do, what it is (What it do)

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
It's— Paul Wall, baby, Swishahouse club rocker
Chunk a deuce, sip a deuce, pouring up the Goose vodka
Lone Star beast, straight up out the H
Sure stopping all the hate, sippin on the ski taste
I got the INS on my tail, Immigration still harass
'Cause they see me in a foreign, riding on imported glass
Getting cash is my number-one task
Until I'm under the grass, that's why I'm top of the class
I'm a GRiT Boy looking for a ass like Ki Toy
Leave a bitch back all nutty like Almond Joy
My boy Joey I.E. got the sweet
And Neek got the Sweets, and Gu got the freaks
Beat it up like a ass-whipping
The album dropped, and it's been a lot of ass-kissing
But I ain't tripping, I'm trill
That's why I'm posted with Khaled, 'cause he the real
One hundred, baby, like a bill—holla at me, baby

[Chorus: Paul Wall, Fat Joe, & Both]
Holla at me, what it do, what it is
You ain't never seen a playa like this (Holla at me, baby, Khaled!)

Take her back, then I put it in her ribs (Holla at me, baby, oww!)

You ain't never seen rocks like this (Holla at me, baby)
You can see it from afar, I'm the shit (Yeah, ugh)
Scream at me, what it do, what it is (What it do, ugh, yeah)

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Nah, homie, you done got it fucked up
You ain't got as much money as us (Nope, nope)
We sent Campbell in 'cause he got goggles on
And he pushing something foreign as fuck (Oww!)
Now, all I gotta do is push a little button quick fast
And the chopper come out of the stash (Br-r-rat!)
Yeah, money ain't jewels, motherfucker, you lose
I'll make you do the fucking Sean Combs dance (Follow me now)
Who wan' come test the king?
Have your baby ma' bless the team (Mmm-mwah!)
Shit, I ain't even know she could twerk it like that
She a motherfucking sex machine—holla at me, baby (Oww!)

[Chorus: Paul Wall]
Holla at me, what it do, what it is

You can see it from afar, I'm the shit
Scream at me, what it do, what it is (What it do)

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
Stunting in a Magnum, riding with my hat low
Forty-five Magnum, barrel full of airholes
Dade County (Represent), dope boy (Ever since)
Know that I'm a (Veteran), million-dollar (Residence)
Rick Ross (Big chips), AKs (Flip clips)
Offset rims; on the rear, six-inch lips
Started on the (Benches), rose through the (Trenches)
Now, I'm the shit, bitch, go and check your (Census)
Known for the (Benzes), chrome on the Bentleys
Smoking on the (Mint leaves), then counting big cheese
Flip soft (Whip that), Rick Ross (Whip that)

[Chorus: Paul Wall & Pitbull]
Holla at me, what it do, what it is
You ain't never seen a playa like this (Holla at me, baby)
I'ma pimp her, I'll show her how I live
Take her back, then I put it in her ribs (Holla at me, baby)
I'm a monster, I do it real big
You ain't never seen rocks like this (Holla at me, baby)
You can see it from afar, I'm the shit (EEEE-YUUU!)
Scream at me, what it do, what it is (What it do)

[Verse 5: Pitbull]
It's Mr. 305, AKA—
Mr. Snort Yay', Spit Rocks, Made in Dade
I owe my future: the last name Campbell, first name Luther
The Gunshine State, where they shoot you
The bottom, the crib, what they do (What it is)
Bust a clip (Flip a brick)—"Hey, buddy, where's the lick?"
"That's all we talk about?" Well, welcome to the South
We in, get our bread, then we out, no doubt, huh
'Palas and 'prices (Haha); these boys dirty
They fuck your mother, sister, daughter and nieces
Ahora, loca, mueva la cadera
Abre la boca y viene la madera (Woo!)

[Chorus: Paul Wall]
Holla at me, what it do, what it is
You ain't never seen a playa like this (Holla at me, baby)
I'ma pimp her, I'll show her how I live
Take her back, then I put it in her ribs (Holla at me, baby)
I'm a monster, I do it real big
You ain't never seen rocks like this (Holla at me, baby)
You can see me from afar I'm the shit
Scream at me, what it do, what it is (What it do)

[Hook]
I'm gonna fuck me
A girl from Kentucky
Right before I come
I'm a make her sucky-sucky
Pull out my baseball bat
Beat up her wildcat
Get my bone licked after dark
In Big Bone Lick Park

[Verse 1]
Got a new job in Lexington
Had sex with her mouth and tongue
Pick me still Lexington, still Louisville
Sip that dank, smoke that herbie
Ride that ass like the Kentucky Derby
All the way to Frankfort
Smoke some dank and I gots to skirt
Got like a quadruple of G from Cali
Staying away from PeeWee Valley
Bet I am in the city of Beaver Dam
Daaaaaaaaaamn
Gladys from Glasgow
Likes it in the asshole
Miss Owens from Owensboro
Sucked me thorough, then she had to earl

[Hook]
I'm gonna fuck me
A girl from Kentucky
Right before I come
I'm a make her sucky-sucky
Pull out my baseball bat
Beat up her wildcat
Get my bone licked after dark
In Big Bone Lick Park

[Verse 2]
Rich old lady from Willemore
Put me in her will if I'd fuck her more
Met this girl from Pikeville
She was a dyke but I fucked her still
I know a girl in Livermore
I put it by her liver and she quiver more
Came in her mouth in Mount Sterling
She started coughing, she started earling
Fucked this girl from Mount Vernon
Took a piss and my dick was burning
Went to the doctor, spent some pape
Condoms, super glue, duct tape
Fucked all the girls in Danville
Now it's Afroman-ville
Came in her mouth in Paducah
She spit it out like Pa-choo-Ka!
London panties falling down even in Elizabethtown
London panties falling down, fine ass lady

[Hook]
I'm gonna fuck me
A girl from Kentucky
Right before I come
I'm a make her sucky-sucky
Pull out my baseball bat
Beat up her wildcat
Get my bone licked after dark
In Big Bone Lick Park

[Verse 3]
I met this girl from Radcliffe
Stuck my finger up her ass then I made her sniff
Met a cowgirl from Horse Cave
Rode my horse all in her cave
Dirt-diggler, booty-jiggler, titty-wiggler
Called me the giggler
Giggling while I was stabbing
Doggy-style pussy jabbing
I got barred from Bardstown
My dick got hard and I fucked all the broads around
Albany - she fucked all my homeboys but me!
Met this girl from Pine Grove
Stuck my dick in her ass then I drove
All the way to Bowling Green
Her colon kinda swollen if you know what I mean

[Hook]
I'm gonna fuck me
A girl from Kentucky
Right before I come
I'm a make her sucky-sucky
Pull out my baseball bat
Beat up her wildcat
Get my bone licked after dark
In Big Bone Lick Park

[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Verse 1]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Verse 2]
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Outro]
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way

[Intro: News Sample]
He's known as El Chapo or Shorty and he's no doubt the most feared and the most dangerous drug lord in all of Mexico. Police turned up four more bodies, churned in the trunk of a burned-out car near the....

[Chorus]
All we wanna be is El Chapo
At least all the street niggas I know
All I wanna be is El Chapo
Fully automatic slice your auto
All I wanna be is El Chapo
3 Billion dollars in pesos
All I wanna be is El Chapo
And when I meet him, I'ma tell him bravo

[Verse 1]
I live a life so crazy make me start smokin' newports
And you ain't comin' in, I'ma serve you in the front porch
My plug he comin' in, I'm about a scoop him from the airport
And ain't no room for nothin' else but money in my condo
Ballin' like a bitch you think my grandmother Griselda
These suckas they can't wait to double cross you like Diego
I'm whackin' niggas, taxin' niggas similar to Pablo
I'm big chained touchin' every penny like I'm Castro
Boss shit mob hits Lucky Luciano
Bricksquad Records like the damn Gambinos
The shit that I done did has only been done by Latinos
Dope so good you think it came from El Chapo

[Chorus]
All we wanna be is El Chapo
At least all the street niggas I know
All I wanna be is El Chapo
Fully automatic slice your auto
All I wanna be is El Chapo
3 Billion dollars in pesos
All I wanna be is El Chapo
And when I meet him, I'ma tell him bravo

[Verse 2]
Plane just touch down thanks to Amado
Best coke in the world going through your nostrils
Plugs steady send the dope in by the boat load
Severing niggas heads off like El Loco
A hundred bricks is nothin' if you Jesus Elizando
My big toy Emilio got it in the choke hold
Spent a half a million last year on Forgiatos
And no I am not a catholic confessin' is a no no
So many bricks of brown and white you know we got a snow roll
Coke so clean every one brick is a combo
A little handgun in every pocket in my cargo
And it's a stack for a kilo if you get it in the jungle

[Chorus]
All we wanna be is El Chapo
At least all the street niggas I know
All I wanna be is El Chapo
Fully automatic slice your auto
All I wanna be is El Chapo
3 Billion dollars in pesos
All I wanna be is El Chapo
And when I meet him, I'ma tell him bravo

[Verse 1]
Picture this: coming home from a long day's work, no food is left
Picture this: steady tryna show the world of your worth and nobody cares
Picture this: no kissing, ain't no touching, there's no hugging
And in the evening no good loving

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't no pretty picture you can paint
Ain't no way this life would be the same

[Chorus]
I'm telling you a man can't be a man without a woman, no
And you can try as hard as you can but we ain't nothing without a woman, nothing
Living in a world so cold, so cold, cold
The fire burns through my soul, without a woman

[Verse 2]
What if you, had no hands to rub upon your shoulders
And in the morning she's not there to fix your Folgers
You're sick as a dog right now
Kids running all around the house, no one to help you out
Picture this: you paying these bills all by yourself
No one to tell you, "Watch your health", but keep fucking up, you might as well
Picture this: 'cause your world don't spin without her
And hers gon' spin without you

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't no pretty picture you can paint
Ain't no way this life would be the same

[Chorus]
I'm telling you a man can't be a man without a woman, no
And you can try as hard as you can but we ain't nothing without a woman, nothing
Living in a world so cold, so cold, cold
The fire burns through my soul, without a woman

[Bridge]
Say hello to pain, goodbye to love
Hello to rain, the sun won't ever shine again
There'll be no Wednesday movie nights
No make-ups after fights
Girl, I'll make it right
I'm all lonely with my pillow
Your car's not in the driveway, clothes ain't in the closet
Girl, I'm broken-hearted, come and find me 'cause I'm lost without my woman

[Chorus]
And I know that a man can't be a man without a woman
You can try hard as you can, without a woman, nothing
Living in a world so cold, cold
The fire burns through my soul, without my woman

[Outro]
See baby, life ain't life
And living ain't living without my woman
I'm hurting inside
Without my woman no, no, no

[Skit: Eminem, Steve Berman]

[*"The Way I Am" by Eminem plays in the background*]

*Eminem opens the door*
"Hey Steve... Uh, Vanessa said you wanted to see me? What's up?"
"Marshall... I can call you Marshall, right?"
"Uhh... sure"
"Good
Sit the fuck down for a second"
"Okay"
"Do you just fucking hate me?"
"Hate you? What—"
"What the fuck have I ever done to you?
Your last record, we got lucky
This D12 album is fucked!"
"What's wrong with it?"
"I don't wanna rape my grandmother!
I don't wanna have sex with pitbulls!
I wanna roll on dubs, I want throw bows, I wanna rock prada!"
"Rock prada?"
"And who the fuck is this Bizarre guy?"
"What do you mean?"
"Do you need a cat-scan?! Where the fuck did you find this guy?!"
"I—I mean, I've known him for like..."
"This album's never coming out"
"Steve, you've only heard one song!"
"Fuck you! Get the fuck outta here!
Now!"
"O-Okay, okay, shit!!"

[Verse 1]
Here we go, here again, here again
I wanna know, how you been, how you been
Such a surprise, didn't think you'd come back so soon
Got a drink in my cup girl, got weed rolled up but I'm high off you tonight
Bet yo ass ain't think I will come so hard upon this Chapter V
I've toured the world and made some money, learned some different things
And now I'm here to show your body what these niggas can't
Your panty dropper has returned and I'm going low
To please your body is my mission, if you don't know
Just take your time I just wanna go nice and slow

[Pre-Chorus]
First thing take off them clothes
But you can leave them panties on
You've had my love before
So you know I might make 'em soak

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm your panty wetter
I'm your panty wetter
You ain't gotta take 'em off, just pull it to the side
Don't you try to run girl, ain't no place to hide
I'm your panty wetter
And you know it don't, it won't get no better
No one is gon' get you wetter

[Verse 2]
Here we are you and me, you and me
A special show made for two to see
Girl, we 'bout to make the best love you've ever dreamed

[Pre-Hook]
But you gon' have to come about them clothes
You can leave them panties on
You've had this love before
So you know I'm 'bout to make you soak

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm your panty wetter
I'm your panty wetter
You ain't gotta take 'em off, just pull it to the side
Don't you try to run girl, ain't no place to hide
I'm your panty wetter
And you know it don't, it won't get no better
No one is gon' get you wetter

[Bridge]
Break it down
All the way down

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm your panty wetter
I'm your panty wetter
You ain't gotta take 'em off, just pull it to the side
Don't you try to run girl, ain't no place to hide
I'm your panty wetter
And you know it don't, it won't get no better
No one is gon' get you wetter

[Outro]
No one is gonna get you wetter than a fountain
Waterfalling off my mountain
It's such beauty when we meet
I'm the sand and you're the sea
I'm the pipe girl you're the leak
It's only one thing left you can do for me
Take 'em off, take 'em off, take 'em off
Please

[Hook]
Ridahman, Ridahman, does whatever a rida can
What’s with that in your socks? And you fuckin’ niggas all want Siroc
Ridahman, Ridahman, keep a big getup inside my hand
What’s with that in your socks? Grab this motherfucker in your sight
Look out (look out!) bitch here comes the Ridahman

[Verse I:]
Now there once was a man who lived in my hood
To some people bad but to me he was good
He wore pindletens and 501 jeans
And the black Chuck Taylors with black yellow strings
He loved makin’ poise and smokin’ up blunts
And the weed that he be smokin’ have you flowin’ for months
You could smell the dealer comin’ from a mile away
And if he see the kids snoopin’ he be down to play
But if a nigga got to trippin’ he be down the sprets
That be AK—K-K-K-K-K
But this one time, this one guy
Thought he could come to our town and drive
And go against the ridah but Ridah is the ridah
He hit it with 11 and he knockin’ with the rida
He usually wore the shot but he gave the boy an ass
Said if you’ll come back nigga, that’ll be your ass
But the young nigga laughed, he didn’t seem to be scared
But he definitely took a car and got his ass up outta there
And we later found out that the guy’s name was Tommy
And Ridahman used to mess with his son’s mommy

[Hook]

[Verse II:]
Now Tommy went home and told his homeboy Ronny
And Ronny told Johnny and Johnny got money
And Lonny was a shooter and his weapon was a Tommy
He didn’t care about life, he’ll shoot anybody
So they came back to my neighborhood to drive
And found Ridahman and he ran ‘em for their lives
Used his rida senses to go behind the mine
What kind of car they drive? So he what (…)
And there they go. See him pass a nigga Black Reeker
So he reached into his pocket and pulled out a Desert Eagle
Rida start bussin’, I think he hit somethin’
Tommy falls out the car with his whole bullshit
And his homie didn’t make it, Ridahman got ‘em all
Even Lonny gave the kid a chance to bust the Tommy off
Ridahman goes over to Tommy and then he laughs
And he laughs ‘bout the nigga but my gun start blastin’
Yea, how’d you know that I was comin’ with my people?
And you even knew the car, how’d you knew it was a Reegle?
Well, besides me being the Ridahman
Your son’s mom told me, now okay, bye my man

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Tyga]
My Isis goddess, a peach garden
Sipping Merlot, beach bums, bumping Bob Marley
Reggae party, shirt Cavalli, dress highly
Highly infatuated, spending what you call life savings
Hi ladies, nice day, ain’t it?
South France be my new lady, canvas face paintings
If God were me, you’d be more jealous, the horny
I’d backtrack, hop on the right track with a new somebody
Now let’s back track two years, where I met you at
Night life, popping bottles, acting like you wasn’t impressed with that
That shit, I do for you, I never lack
Need that, got that, never did I second guess
Took you out that C-class, put you in that SLS
No more Southwest, now it’s like private jets
Now all you got is ex-roommates
Cause all you got now is too much room space, shoe space

[Chorus]
Same page but a different day
Everything sweet, peace till a nigga be down and out
Same shit you said yesterday
Can’t take no more of your shit cause I can do better without you
I can do better without you

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Symbolic tattoos cover the scar
Heart tell 'em love move
Cause of you I’ll probably never accept what’s due
Except what’s due, exempt from them nights I could’ve been single too
Moonlight dinner, dark denim
How we losing, we was up in the ninth inning
The night’s ending, attitude on a fire chariot
Ain’t too hilarious, find it embarrassing, you crazy bitch
All I wanted was pom poms, hug and a kiss
Thought you rooting for this team, saw you on some other shit
Acting out publicly, fans recording the shit
Why you can’t play your part and act accordingly?
I guess that’s all me, rubbing off on me
Rubbing off on you, now you got an ego, too
Tell her spread far like an eagle do
I don’t want nothing to do with you, I’m through with you

[Chorus]
Same page but a different day
Everything sweet, peace till a nigga be down and out
Same shit you said yesterday
Can’t take no more of your shit cause I can do better without you
I can do better without you

[Bridge]
You never thought i’d do it, you never thought i’d leave you
You told me you loved me, but I never believed you
Your heart was false just like the words you said
Your stupid ass, corny lines trying to fill my head
Shit, caught up in your perfect world, you never heard me cry
That’s why you never expect to see me say goodbye
You know I’m better off without you
I can manage on my own, you can still have your perfect life
You could have it all alone, cause I’m better without you

[Chorus]
Same page but a different day
Everything sweet, peace till a nigga be down and out
Same shit you said yesterday
Can’t take no more of your shit cause I can do better without you
I can do better without you

[Verse 1]
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I had, you're all I had

[Pre-Chorus]
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself

[Chorus]
Talking to the moon
Tryna get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
'Cause when the sun goes down, someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself

[Chorus]
Talking to the moon
Tryna get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?

[Bridge]
Do you ever hear me calling?
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
'Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon

[Chorus]
Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too
Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?

[Outro]
Oh-oh
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away

[Intro: The Sylvers & Kendrick Lamar]
Pillars of joy can be found
Through the thought of you
I'll be troubled and bustled and scorned for your love
Canei Finch on the beat
Turn the headphones up, Ali
Here we go

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up this morning with my dick on hard
Didn't know why 'til I said fuck all y'all
Or fuck this world, or I'mma fuck that girl
Good kid, m.A.A.d city, watch my day unfurl
I put my life in these sentences
Fucking right, it's either that or life sentences
I'm relatives with Benjamin
I used to give a fuck about my luck when I was innocent
Now what the fuck is up? I'm at your neck like a Pendleton
Nigga, I need that, bitch, I need that
Twenty-four acres and a mule, best believe that
They say he got smoke, like where the weed at?
And everything you hope, bitch nigga, we that
Pockets on Kelly Price back when it was '95
Buy a strap and then we cock it back when it's uncircumcised
Write a rap on how we just react when shotty hit the spine
Give you dap and then we slide through your hood three dozen times
So what's good? I'm looking for a pedicure
Pink pussy that pop, preferably the kind that don't stink
Bomb-ass head 'til she can't blink
And her eyes get watery, you gotta pardon me

[Hook 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm so damn turnt
Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me
And you know, Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but
Westside, right on time, only thing fosho
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
I woke up this morning like fuck the world
Been hustling since I was twelve, man, I've been through hell
Now these motherfuckers is trying to tell me I don't care
Trying to tell y'all motherfuckers, look, y'all wasn't there
Turnt, posted up on the block, waiting for mail
From my niggas posted up in the county, praying for bail
Could've cost your boy everything, man, it wasn't cheap
Coming for a nigga, just don't sleep, shit for the weak
Got on my Malcolm X frames, now I count the check, mane
'Cause every time I speak, you hear my Malcolm X pain
Now them doors go up on that Lamb, they like judo
Young, you like your bitches with ass? I like you, hoe!
First, them bitches see me, I'm gone, I'm like Pluto
Plus, I keep them choppers that sing, they Mars Bruno
Brown bag full of cash, baby, MCM
When they ask me my name, I tell 'em MC him, straight up

[Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm so turnt
Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me
And you know, Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but
Westside, right on time, only thing fosho
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
All praise go to the most high
All fades turn into a drive-by
Part ways from the streets, after fucking with police guaranteed
Last nigga did that died, don't you, don't you, don't you
Wanna live where the AK go for only 8K
Minus six racks, minus one on top of that?
Melee, stomp him out then drug him out like a date rape
Daytonas bending every corner while they say

[Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm so turnt
Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me
And you know, Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but
Westside, right on time, only thing fosho
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
All I ever wanted was a dollar bill and hundreds
And my teacher as my woman, when she smiled, I stick my tongue in
Plus some cartoons and some cereal, Snoop Doggy on my stereo
Some British Knights or LA Gears with glowing lights or Perry Ellis jacket
I would love a swapmeet full of Chevrolets in candy paint
That's wet with Tammy on the bumper, can I hump her? Poppa tell me yes
A DPGC concert and a DJ Quik song on cassette
Twenty years later: hi hater, I'm the fucking best

[Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm so turnt
Wheeling in a two-door with two hoes that follow me
And you know, Westside, right on time, tell 'em hoes kudos
Eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though
When my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
Came a long way from the ghetto, dog, but
Westside, right on time, only thing fosho
Eastside, right on time, gunning through your door

[Intro]
Are you gonna take me home tonight?
Oh, down beside that red firelight?
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rockin' world go 'round

[Verse 1]
Hey, I was just a skinny lad
Never knew no good from bad
But I knew life before
I left my nursery, huh
Left alone with big fat Fanny
She was such a naughty nanny
Hey, big woman
You made a bad boy out of me
Hey, hey, woo!

[Verse 2]
I've been singing with my band
Cross the water, cross the land
I've seen every blue eyed
Floozy on the way, hey
But their beauty and their style
Went kinda smooth after a while
Take me to them dirty ladies every time
Come on

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you take me home tonight
Oh, down beside your red firelight?
Oh, and you give it all you got
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rockin' world go 'round
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rockin' world go 'round

[Verse 3]
Hey, listen here
Now, I got mortgages on homes
I got stiffness in my bones
Ain't no beauty queens
In this locality, I tell you
Oh, but I still get my pleasure
Still got my greatest treasure
Hey, big woman, you gonna make
A big man of me, now get this

[Chorus]
(Oh, I know) Are you gonna
Take me home tonight? (Please)
Oh, down beside that red firelight?
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls
You make the rockin' world go 'round
(Yeah) Fat bottomed girls
You make the rockin' world go 'round
Get on your bikes and ride!

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Them fat bottomed girls
(Fat bottomed girls)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright, ride 'em cowboy
(Fat bottomed girls)
Yes, yes!

[Verse 1]
You’re bad for me
I clearly get it
I don’t see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
'Cause with every hug and kiss, you’re snatching every bit of strength
That I’m gon' need to fight off the inevitable
And it’s a heart-breakin' situation I’m up in, but I can’t control

[Chorus]
You’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do
It’s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don’t want it, but I do
You’re just like poison
My affliction, I’m addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

[Verse 2]
You ain't right, take me high
Then that high, it subsides
And my body flat-lines
Then you come to revive
Wait, wait, wait, I’m alive
But how long will it last?
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What’s the prognosis, will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down?

[Chorus]
Baby, you’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do
It’s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don’t want it, but I do
You’re just like poison
My affliction, I’m addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

[Bridge]
It’s just not my body (no)
It’s my mind
You don’t know how many times I told myself this can't do
And that I don’t need you (no, I don’t need you, no)
It’s so unfair
That I find myself right back in your care
And what’s good is that when you’re not always there
(there, there)
You're no good for my health, my health

[Post-Chorus]
You’re just like poison (whoa, whoa, whoa)
You’re just like poison (whoa, whoa, whoa)

[Chorus]
You’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do
It’s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don’t want it, but I do
You’re just like poison
My affliction, I’m addicted, I can't lie
Baby, kiss me one more time

[Chorus]
You’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do
It’s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don’t want it, do
You’re just like poison
I’m addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

[Intro]
"Alright baby girl, lets sing to it."

[Pre-Verse 1]
You're getting your degree, you're going to college
I'm making music and hoping that Kanye puts me on
But If I don't make it baby, would you be mad at me?
If I just chilled at home as your stay-home-daddy?

[Verse 1]
Come on, I'll make you coffee (coffee), and a bagel (bagel)
And another bagel (two bagels)
Keep on reading that paper, then it's off you go
"Hun, you're gonna be late
Don't forget your briefcase, drive safe" ("Peace, babe")
Wake up the kids, toast the toast, put the Raisin Bran up in the bowl
The toast.. did I forget the toast?
The toast is toast, dammit, I burnt the toast
Start crying, the kid's like, "Dad, what's wrong?"
"Oh, it's not you, kids, it's just me, I'm alone
Papa's a little bit stressed out... fuck!"
Feeling so sensitive, I'm going for a latte
See what's popping at pilates
Hit up my friends like, "Yo, what up man, tryna have a spa day?"
"The fuck? You're a stay at home dad, that's not gay!"

[Hook]
Ay, ay, ay, ay, you go to work, I mow the lawn
Ay, ay, ay, ay, you make the cheese, I'll bring the guac (nacho sauce, Spanish)
Ay, ay, ay, ay, you buy the clothes, I'll take them off ("JNCOS! FUBU!")
Ay, ay, ay, ay, I'm a stay at home dad, this is my job

[Pre-Verse 2]
You go girl, get that promotion
I'll be on the sofa, collecting unemployment
Yelling at the T.V., watching Maury Povich
Quit groping that girl, Maury Povich

[Verse 2]
Who is this Jenny Jones bitch?
Shit, it's four o'clock, time for Oprah (Oprah!)
The gospel of the Lord, for dads who stay at home
Even though we can't get boners
We still watch Rachael Ray and Emeril cook lasagna
Swooping up the kids from soccer practice (soccer practice)
Then time for gymnastics, Rice Crispy treats and wax baggies
I'm with my kids in the minivvan, listening to NPR
With the windows down, through the cul de sac

Then it's homework time, dinner time, set the placemats
Cook, clean, tuck the rugrats in blankets
Then I lay you down, pop two Cialis, put on Sting
And then go quench my palette
Is that douche, or does your cooch just smell like flowers?
Your feet are calloused, peppermint towlette
Jasmine pedicure? Scented oil, homeopathic backrub?
I am Alladin, your carpet is magic, your wish has been granted
I would just love to ride your carpet out of the palace
Now keep on bringing the green, baby, and I'll keep on tossing salad

[Hook]

[Outro]
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have been conditioned to believe we must fit in a role, brainwashed by Babylon. Depicting our role must match our genitalia, hell to the no. It's men who go to work, and women raise the children, but I know the hardest job is maintaining the household, so I am doing a back-to-back, no tradebacks, with this briefcase. For 2010, I am staying at home."

[Verse 1]
The doors open and everybody turns around
To see you walk down the aisle in your pretty white gown
You're holding your daddy's arm, your tears begin to fall
And both of our lives are about to change forever
Everybody stands, she reaches out her hand
The preacher says, "We've gathered here today"

[Chorus]
And I, I almost lose it
When I hear you say "I do"
And I'm so in love with you
Baby, I almost lose it
When I see that pretty face
It's more than I can take

[Verse 2]
I wonder if she's nervous or will she get cold feet
She wears a smile as the diamond shines from her wedding ring
I hope it's everything you wanted, you deserve the best
Always knew I'd be the reason for your wedding dress
So beautiful, the way you read your vows
Then the wedding bells ring

[Chorus]
And I, I almost lose it
When I hear you say "I do"
And I'm so in love with you
Baby, I almost lose it
When I see that pretty face
It's more than I can take

[Bridge]
As the tears roll down your cheek, it's impossible for me to speak
My heart is beating fast and my knees are feeling weak
So speak now or forever hold your peace
Can't help but wonder from my seat, if he knows you were meant for me

[Chorus]
And I, I almost lose it
When I hear you say "I do"
And I'm so in love with you
Baby, I almost lose it
When I see that pretty face
It's more than I can take

[Outro]
Can't help but wonder from my seat if he knows
Does he know you are meant for me?
Do you know? Can't help but wonder
You know, you are meant for me girl
And if you didn't know, that you are, you are
And I, I almost lose it

[Intro]
I'll fuck you up, bitch

[Verse]
Uh, yeah, this is stadium rap
Hotter than the last name on my alias Jack Rip
Bad bitch flip our gymnasiums back
Track itch shit's dope, y'all should slang it in sacks
Shit's sellin for ten, harder than elephant skin
Benevolent grin, I stay gold, you settle for tin
Wolf Gang, wolf pack, packin' weapons in tens
So take a wild guess as to why they lettin' us in
Please, Earl lettin' the competitor win
Is the equivalent of steppin' with stilettos in gyms
It's not happenin', so while I'm standin' checkin' your chin
Know the flow takes the "h" out of "shins," fin
Lord hear me now
Junk boats and English boys
Crashing out in super marts
Electric fences and guns

You swallow me
I'm a pill on your tongue
Here on the nineteenth floor
The neon lights make me calm

And late in a star's life
It begins to explode
And all the people in a dream
Wait for the machine
To pick the shit up, leave it clean

Kid, hang over here
What you learning in school?
Is the rise of an Eastern sun
Gonna be good for everyone?
The radio station disappears
Music turning to thin air
The DJ was the last to leave
She had well conditioned hair
Was beautiful, but nothing really was there

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
The young man stands on the edge of his porch
The days were short, and the father was gone
There was no one in the town, and no one in the field
This dusty barren land had given all it could yield

[Verse 2]
I've been kicked off my land at the age of sixteen
And I have no idea where else my heart could have been
I placed all my trust at the foot of this hill
And now I am sure my heart will never be still
So collect your courage and collect your horse
And pray you never feel this same kind of remorse

[Chorus]
Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time

[Verse 3]
Well, you are my accuser, now look in my face
Your oppression reeks of your greed and disgrace
So one man has, and another has not
How can you love what it is you have got
When you took it all from the weak hands of the poor?
Liars and thieves, you know not what is in store

[Verse 4]
There will come a time I will look in your eye
You will pray to the God that you've always denied
Then I'll go out back and I'll get my gun
I'll say, "You haven't met me, I am the only son"

[Chorus]
Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time

[Interlude]

[Chorus 2]
Well yes sir, yes sir, yes, it was me
I know what I've done, cause I know what I've seen
I went out back, and I got my gun
I said, "You haven't met me, I am the only son"

[Verse 1]
SB dunks, five seven five jeans
5000 dollars on my fuckin' wallet chain
I be wilin' man, I'm a island man
There ain't nothin' else by me, man (Ha, ha)
I tell them float on and go on to the ozone I'm so gone
My blunt like a pole long I pro long and hold on
To it like a trombone I'm so blown and um
I got that cock back I don't need that thumb bone
So come on, you get the one with the drum on it
That's the one that goes dit Di-di-di-di-di-di-dit
I'm so terrific when I spit, put my foot up in yo ass
Now I'm kickin' in yo shit now I'm pitchin' at yo bitch
And she catch it with her lip, nah, she catch it with her mouth
And since I'm the president, she tried to catch it on her blouse
I tell her, whoa, easy, baby
I'm king cake so she eat the baby
Wait, shit gets way more crazier
We flip the bitch like she was in the gymnasium
I ain't fuckin' with the bitches with the stadium
That's no dome, bitch, go home

[Verse 2]
Bitch I spit the hundred winters on my snow cone
Lil' nigga walkin' like he get his bowl on
Boss man, pimp stro, pimp stro
I can let my money go when the wind blow
Then it come right back like a rental
And make them bitches understand me like 10 fo
Niggas is simple, like instrumentals
I bet you bitches understand me like info
Get ya top chopped and get trimmed low
Somethin' like my Benzo, Ridin' with my friend's hoes
No, I mean my ho's friends, fuckin' all my ho's friends
Takin' all my ho's ends that will make that globe spin
I tell these young niggas, pimp or die
Won't get that Benz if they don't split them Eyes dip 'em thighs, thin 'em ties
And if you reach at I
I don't preach, I screech and give you beef with them fries Yeah
Come to the beach and find
I live where all the little seagulls fly
See, baby, I'm so high
All I need you to do is just shut up and ride

[Verse 3]
Me an' Mac is just two niggas from the same hood
Fell from the same tree, cut from the same wool
I'm just the young lion and he the young bull
Not Sammy the Bull, that pistol on my hip, now I gotta hand in the pool
I had a Lammy in school
I think it was diablo red
I'm t-i-red, I'm T.I red
You D.I-ed because of what you said
Chyee, I'm sharp as an image
And I keep it bumpin' like a mothafuckin' blemish
Two twins drink me up like Guinness
When I'm finished, I say, "Billion"
When I'm finished they say, "Weezy, you killed it"
Hop on your shit and say, "Weezy, you healed it"
So fly I got wings tattooed on me
A gun glued on me, but I pop ya in ya stomach
Now I got yesterday's food on me
Now that was real rude, homie
And I smell like a weed plant
Young Money mothafucka, where that cheese at?
I mean I've been doing some thinking you know
And we only teenagers but I do love you
But I think we gotta move on
Don't cry though
Listen this is teenage love baby

When I'm alone all I'm thinking about is my girl
You smile your pretty face' and them light brown curls
At first I was playing and saying cause love is a horrible thing
The way straight to it didn't hesitate
Wit any these Tyga my friends call me fly than yah
X-men head is flying
Being honest I am more than what you can find in cereal boxes
Be my goddess higher in this world
I could take your body
Probably being a man is not an option its a hobby
So you holding my hand is what other girls is watching
Picks up your prints in your locker
Put this lip gloss on and get the haters poppin lil mamma

[Chorus]
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Don't don't don't hurt me again
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Don't don't don't hurt me again
You call up the studio
I said about another hour
But you refused to hear it, saying baby do you miss me
But my intentions were to play this song when I visit you
Screaming up conversations everybodys trying to listen
But we only young and infacuated, sprung, in lust
I think I'm all the above two teenagers in love
I gave up them girls you gave up the club
I gave you everything you wanted just because
I was waiting for cupid to come shooting arrows through my heart
Now you wanna be apart
Watcha mean you finished
We only at the start and to leave when it girl we come oh so far

[Chorus]
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Don't don't don't hurt me again
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Don't don't don't hurt me again

Listen up pivit its to risky
I don't get it
I'm feeling dizzy
The rooms spinning
You've got to be kidding
My teenages misses, you leave now my life is ended, my life is ended
Teenage love its a teenage love 

[2x]
Don't don't don't hurt me again
Its a teenage love love love love 

[3x]
Don't don't don't hurt me again

[Chorus]
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Don't don't don't hurt me again
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Teenage love (teenage love)
Don't don't don't hurt me again

Don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again
Don't don't don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again
Don't hurt me again

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(When this began) I had nothing to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused) Looking everywhere, only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me
(Nothing to lose) Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm somewhere I belong
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belong

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, I'm a fool, hundred thousand for the jewels
Last year we killed the game and left y'all browsing for the clues
Old niggas out here searching for that fountain of the youth
Money talks and hoes say it's an arousing point of view
Don't make me act a fool like Malcolm before the suit
How could you justify, I testified up in this booth
And then, throughout the years, spilled tears and shed truth
Somehow they love a nigga better when he talk about his loot
Chain like a kaleidoscope, see life through a wider scope
Therefore, I know this necklace really represents a noose
Still I hit the jeweler how much racks to make me cooler
I just play the game homie, I ain't make the rules up
Started from the bottom same way you lace your shoes up
So if I'm blowing cake, just blame it on the place I grew up
Where niggas had nothing but dreams and television
Got no plans of seeing hell or prison
You can tell I'm living, right?

[Bridge: Cee-Lo sample]
I'm a fool (Never said I'm livin' right)
Such a fool
For you

[Hook: J. Cole]
And they like
Boy you a fool

Boy you a fool
Boy you a fool

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I'm a fool, hundred thou to go to school
So much debt me and my mama damn near drowning in a pool
The first to go to college, they say knowledge is the tool
But these hoes on campus make a young nigga drool
So we party, skip class, get ass and talk cool
Meanwhile, she back home working hard, I use that as my fuel
So I finally graduated but I'm sad to say it
I ain't learn a fucking thing except the game and how to play it, damn!
I'm a fool, no scuffs on my shoes
No cuts, I don't bruise, so fuck y'all reviews
She told me, "Cole, I love you, rode with you before the riches
But you way too educated to be calling women bitches
And calling brothers niggas, pardon if I crossed a line
But all this time knew you was different than all them other niggas"
I responded to her, "Please don't put me on a pedestal
'Cause I know better and I'm still a fool"

[Bridge: Cee-Lo sample]
I'm a fool (Yeah, I know it's pitiful)
Such a fool
For you

[Hook: J. Cole]
And they like
Boy you a fool
Boy you a fool
Boy you a fool

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
This is the place where all the junkies go
Where time gets fast but everything gets slow
Can I get some Vaseline? Step into a modern scene
Take a chance on that which seems to be the making of a dream
I don't wanna do it like my daddy did
I don't wanna give it to my baby's kid

[Chorus]
"This is my calling," I said, darling
Shocking, appalling all I can do to you
"Hammers are falling," I said, darling
Shocking, appalling all I can do to you

[Verse 2]
This is the place where all the devils plead
Their case to take from you what they need
Can I isolate your gene? Can I kiss your dopamine?
In a way I wonder if she's living in a magazine
I don't wanna say it if it isn't so
I don't wanna weigh it, but I've gotta know

[Chorus]
"This is my calling," I said, darling
Shocking, appalling all I can do to you
"Hammers are falling," I said, darling
Shocking, appalling all I can do to you

[Bridge: Kiedis, Kiedis & John Frusciante]
I saw you out there yesterday. What did you wanna say?
A perfect piece of DNA caught in a flashing ray
I caught you out there in the fray. What did you wanna say?
A masterpiece of DNA caught in a flashing ray

[Verse 3]
Can I smell your gasoline?
Can I pet your wolverine?
On the day my best friend died, I could not get my copper clean

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
I don't wanna take it up with little Joe
I don't wanna fake, it but I've gotta know

[Chorus]
"This is my calling," I said, darling
Shocking, appalling all I can do to you
"Hammers are falling," I said, darling
Shocking, appalling  all I can do to you

[Outro]
I am a misfit, I'm born with all of it
The fucking ultimate of love inside the atom split
I'm in a flash ray, a mash of DNA
Another popinjay who thinks he's got something to say

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
I be that nigga from the east side
Put my dart up in your pussy, I don't need no prize
And you don't need those guys
These Versace shades I don't see those guys
I'm the reason that you left the guy
And I'll check the guy if he get outta line
And I ain't here to stress you out
I'm here to stretch it out, and I'ma make it mine
I can put you in the spotlight
I can put you I can put you in the limelight
Yeah, girl, tell me when the time right
That pussy cold I'ma hit it with my Klondike
Yeah and I just wanna fuck with you
Them other girls can't fuck with you
And that nigga he in love with you
But I just wanna bust it lose

[Chorus: Kirko Bangz]
I love the way that you feel

I'm so in love with your style
And you been working so hard
So I'ma make my way to your crib
And let you play this guitar

[Verse 2: Tyga]
B-B-Back it up
I love it when your jeans show your panties, huh
And I'm grabbing on your waist 'cause I'm hard as fuck
Uh I don't want to waste time, we can take it slow
Couple overnights, couple X and O's
Now I gotta take a flight now you're back at home
Can't sleep at all, cause you alone
Ain't comfortable, you need me right there right there
I love how your booty's soft
Man, I really wanna take you down
And I love how she ride on top
Right after sex, and she wipe me off (True)
Man, I'm really loving you
Really wanna put my tongue in you
Ain't no telling what the tongue will do
Make the orgasm last longer than it's supposed to, man

[Chorus: Kirko Bangz]
I love the way that you feel
I love the way that you talk
I love it 'cause you so trill

After I hit her, I'ma quit her, on to the next
Gold rapper latex, I practice safe sex
I'm Barry Bonds I hit the pussy on the first pitch
Boy, I murdered her, yeah I'm a murderer
Ayy, she used to fuck with my nigga Philthy
But he ain't want her though, cause he ain't want a ho
Rhinestones, that's that fake shit

Dope dick, dope dick, that's what she yelling out
Dope dick, dope dick, that's what I'm giving out
Yeah your boy play bitches, like a PlayStation

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Drop 350

The pussy so fire, I'ma need a chimney
Bought a bitch a Bentley; I'm playing
Tell a ho to follow my command (bitch)
Deep in that pussy, quicksand (bitch)
Better recognize I'm the man
Fuck her right I ain't playing, got these hoes on my hands
And they fucking at my shows, we just throw them in the van
Probably fuck and make a grand, I'ma throw another band
Ten, ten damn hoes at the same time
Fucking king gold chains

[Chorus: D-Lo]
Ayy, ayy, she used to fuck with my nigga, though
I don't care nigga, shit, I'ma get her tho
And when I get that ho, I'ma hit that ho
And when I﻿ hit that ho, I'ma forget that ho
Ayy, ayy, she used to fuck with my nigga, though
I don't care nigga, shit, I'ma get her tho
And when I get that ho, I'ma hit that ho
And when I﻿ hit that ho, I'ma forget that ho

[Outro: D-Lo]
European photo, true religions and Polo
I'm leaning, off an 8 ounce of that syrup, that's the ocho
Look, I'm probably with your ho bro; getting dough, though
Replacing, never chasing, I don't care about no ho

[Hook: Tyga]
Uhh, when I switch lanes, Phantom doors swing
Arm out the window screaming "Money ain't a thang"
Call it automatic bang, bang, bang
Call it automatic bang, bang, bang
Rari switch lanes, diamonds in my chain
Been around the world, all the hoes know my name
Call it automatic bang, bang, bang
Miss that automatic bang, bang, bang

[Verse 1: Game]
Fuck a nigga up, Louie belt match the chucks
I'm in the club with Raww nigga, ten ratchets tucked
Back it up like a U-Haul, when cash is up
Spades in my ice bucket, rub that for luck
Racks in my cargos, Audemar stupid
Bitch say she in love with me, stay away from Cupid
The Panamera's sick, lupus
T-Raww, show them how we do it

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Ahh! Swoosh sign, do it
My new bitch a nudist, peace like a buddist
Cooler than Cool Whip, give brain, don't be stupid
Faded like Boosie, cut like a crew neck
Arm out the window, 'nother check, 'nother Rolex
Mo' less, the Moet, the mo' sex, I must say
I boarded the P-jet, more than a piss test
So wake up, I'm fucked up, my ex tryna make up

[Verse 3: Game]
Break up, telling these bitches to get their cake up
Wake up, shooting my babies all on her make-up
I'm running through these hoes, Brandon Jacobs
Lambo doors up, sitting just like her legs
Skeeted off from the club, rather fuck hoes instead

[Hook: Tyga]
Uhh, when I switch lanes, Phantom doors swing
Arm out the window screaming "Money ain't a thang"
Call it automatic bang, bang, bang
Call it automatic bang, bang, bang
Rari switch lanes, diamonds in my chain
Been around the world, all the hoes know my name
Call it automatic bang, bang, bang
Miss that automatic bang, bang, bang

[Verse 4: Tyga]
Never tell a bitch I love her, money talk, Chris Tucker
Got a chauffeur and a driver, I don't lease it, I'ma buy it
Y'all be on a broke diet, you ain't eating but you biting my style
Motherfucker strike like lightning
T-Carti, my bitch like Bvlgari
I walk in the spot, all the bitches bogart me
Spent 30 racks, I'ma make it back tomorrow
Pull up with a big titty bitch like Toccara

[Verse 5: Game]
You ain't never seen a rari, look like a safari
Tyga riding shotgun, snake print Carti-er
I'm in them Nike Airs
2500 nigga, call them Nikes rare
See them niggas hating, but I don't really care
Gold bottles coming, tell them bitches light flares
Snow on my wirst call that Roley big bear
Nigga see it in the light though (woo!) Ric Flair

[Hook: Tyga]
Uhh, when I switch lanes, Phantom doors swing
Arm out the window screaming "Money ain't a thang"
Call it automatic bang, bang, bang
Call it automatic bang, bang, bang
Rari switch lanes, diamonds in my chain
Been around the world, all the hoes know my name
Call it automatic bang, bang, bang
Miss that automatic bang, bang, bang

[Verse 6: Game]
Pull up at the barbershop, chop the top off the Phantom
Bitches screaming A, we ain't where near Atlanta
Maybe she a rockstar, maybe she a sinner
Fucking with them lottery balls, now she a winner
I'm all in that Virginia, I mean that vagina
Get lost in that pussy, nigga you will never find me
Eat it like lasagna, eat it like E-Honda
Shout out my nigga Breezy and beat it like Rihanna

[Hook: Tyga]
Uhh, when I switch lanes, Phantom doors swing
Arm out the window screaming "Money ain't a thang"
Call it automatic bang, bang, bang

Miss that automatic bang, bang, bang

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Well it's that Westside killa, bitch, all about my paper
One hand on my guap, screaming finger fuck a hater
2 hands on my lap two bitches ass naked
300 on the drop, and I'm still your bitch favorite
I want her, I get her, don't need her
Change them like seasons, fall of when I leave her
Yeah I'm cashing out, and I'm riding with that Nina
Dick game ether, she does speaking no English (Ariba!)
Wilding goin' crazy
Yeah, we're in the party and the party getting faded
Already fucked up, I don't know how I made it
And I'ma need a driver, 'cause the driver intoxicated
A nigga can't tame me, two ladies entertain me
Pull my money out, now the club rainin'
Lemon and Cîroc, now my face changing
Looking like cable, watch 'em standing on the table, and I

[Hook]
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Two seater, bitch I ain't in a Beetle
Just put 4's on the ghost, but I don't need 'em
Rich game, no shirt, no ho beater
Hotter than the mufuckin' devil red Beamer
Wrist gleamer, all about my own demeanor
Said he from the land, but niggas said they never seen ya
Put ice in the dial for no reason
And she catch my balls, like goalkeepers
Trippy more, hella bass
Put the bump in your face; why you all up in my space?
Bitch back back, keep my house, cars up to date
Got five hoes with me like I'm on a Elimidate
Nigga don't hate, my money been straight
King gold chains, on the license plate
Yeh, as I valet the ride
2 chains on, no lie

[Hook]
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch

Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch)
Say I'm out this bitch (I'm out this bitch)
She tell me

She like "fuck that shit"
She got me like "fuck that bitch!"
Say I'm out this bitch...

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Same old nigga, make a stack in a day
She the same since high school, back in the day
Cute face, thick thighs with the lil' bitty waist
Since she just finished school, now she work in the back
Now I'm all in the bank, all in the bank
Probably with some niggas that be robbin' the bank
Robbin' the bank, now it's all in the paper
And she told me all about said "I wanna see you later"
But I'm in too deep...
She said she had a nigga but the nigga weak
Said I had a bitch but she told me she too mean
Man I really wanna see you, call me when the nigga leave
You know I'll be right back over
Spend a night over
Mixin' in ya cup, she don't like being sober
In love with her man, so she said it's gettin' late
Can't stay, Now we right back arguing

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tyga:]

Now I'm right back in the same position
With the same bitch that I said I was quittin'
A minute ago, my control over these hoes
Dealing with emotions I don't wanna show
It's like one or two flaws
Dont wanna be involved with her at all
Tired of waiting, I'm gettin' impatient
Cheating lately with her best friend
And the head game crazy
Single now, livin' life, wildin' on the daily
Ain't got time for no sorry, I just bought a Ferrari
Cost me 280, now these bitches wanna call me by my real name
Baby, ain't got time for now motherfuckin' questions
To my exes, hope you learned your lesson
While you out stressin', I'm somewhere out sexin'
On to the next one, onto the next thing
No you ain't trippin (No you ain't trippin'...)
All on the TV, now she tryna text me

[Hook]

Say I'm out this bitch...
Say I'm out this bitch...
We-we-well done

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I said you be where the lames be I be where it's popping at
Money, cars, clothes, and hoes yea I get a lot of that
Haters talkin' dirty bout' the kid we ain't buying
40 oughta clean em up, soak em like a laundromat
Bitches throw the pussy trynna fuck me, where the condom at?
See I'm zeeming trynna keep my semen I ain't down with that
Lil' bitches crazy they wanna have my baby
Cause bank account Ben Franklin out maybe
My president is black, my Glock is too
Ad I probably put a lock on a block near you
I say my niggas get the drop, they gone drop air you
I was never scared of what, what you heard fear who?
I can see with clear view you fuck boys is pussy
And I be on my chill but all you gotta do it push me
And my goons be wishin' for me get a nigga buried
I just give the word and push yo shit back like preliminary
Cemetery bitch you worry fuck you like the bitch you married
Nigga you ain't heard I'm bout word like a dictionary shit
You spit is fictionally
I'm so trilla swingin' through the jungle like gorilla
Banana clip peeler
Niggas sleepin' on you cause you softer then a pillow
Cold pussy talkin' reckless like a killer and em this all for the bitches
Hallows for the snitches we don't play with revolvers
Play with choppas with extenders
I'm a boss I tell that ho to drop and get the business

[Verse 1]
What have I gotta do to make you love me?
What have I gotta do to make you care?
What do I do when lightning strikes me?
And I wake to find that you're not there

[Verse 2]
What do I do to make you want me?
What have I gotta do to be heard?
What do I say when it's all over?
And sorry seems to be the hardest word

[Chorus]
It's sad, (so sad) so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad, (so sad) so sad
Why can't we talk it over?
Oh, it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

[Chorus]
It's sad, (so sad) so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad, (so sad) so sad
Why can't we talk it over?
Oh, it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

[Verse 3]
What do I do to make you love me?
Oh, what have I gotta do to be heard?
What do I do when lightning strikes me?
What have I gotta do?
What have I gotta do?
Ooh, and sorry seems to be the hardest word

[Verse 1]
Okay, ocean view glass house, room full of heaters
Dick game make a faithful bitch start cheating
A blessing to these hoes, got em praying for no reason
Got real niggas with me and all my hoes conceited
I eat it, beat it, then tongue wash clean it
A nigga start tripping, press em, cleaners
Fifty-Two niggas lined up, stay schemin
Turned ballerina when the bullet start hit me
Screaming demons, fire-crack your house
Put them bitches at your front door like a girl scout
Now you run through the back trying to find a way out
But there's no way out, nigga go and take a bow
Finish to my level, I pallbearer your coffin
Is God giving her better, I'm hot, boiling kettle
Tea-bagging your bitch, I call it dipping my drizzle
I probably should take a picture , but she'll probably get offended, Bitch!

[Hook]
I'm a good ass nigga, I don't need no luck
A good ass nigga, I don't need no luck
A good ass nigga, I don't need no luck
Fuck your bitch, now she walking with her nose up
I'm a good ass nigga, I don't need no luck
A good ass nigga, I don't need no luck
A good ass nigga, I don't need no luck
Fuck your bitch, now she walking with her nose up

[Verse 2]
I dreamed a genie, now pimpin is easy
And the ghost make your bitch reappear like Houdini
Spending hours with that toast, get the bread like a birdie
Got a ho like J-Lo, they call her Selena
Riding with that nina, I'm into my stature
Couldn't entertain you little non-factors
Got Eighty-thou for the show in Alaska
Spent 40k on strippers in Atlanta
Fuck off the weekend, fuckin' to the weekend
I got hoes in my house, better believe it
Like Killa Cam, yeah, I Really Mean It
Gotta walk around butt naked in some Valentinos
The new Nino, canceled that bitch and I reload
Click-clack, boom, guess who entered the room
Straps on my side like Tomb, Raider
Patch your eye, I don't gotta try again later

[Hook]
I'm a good ass nigga, I don't need no luck
A good ass nigga, I don't need no luck
A good ass nigga, I don't need no luck
Fuck your bitch, now she walking with her nose up
I'm a good ass nigga, I don't need no luck
A good ass nigga, I don't need no luck
A good ass nigga, I don't need no luck
Fuck your bitch, now she walking with her nose up

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm better than you

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I said it's Kid Ink baby, turnt to the Maxx like T.J.,
Body tagged up like the bottom of the freeway
Game on lock you niggas need to get a key made
Run this shit it ain't nothing but a relay
It ain’t nothing you can tell us
'Bout to roll up kush sticky like Elmer’s
This ain’t no high act like summer
Going head up with me? Bring a motherfuckin' helmet!
You niggas just Special Ed.,
All I see is green but my eyes so red
And all I do is win got a room full of clouds
'Bout to take another shot, but I’m used to the fouls
I'm ballin', you could take two to the mouth
It's Alumni, throw it up two to the south
Tell them deuces, just put two in the air
So sick, said it must be the flu in the air
If you do it big then I prolly did it obese
Thought it was a dream but I ain't never get no sleep
Up all night, gettin' higher then a nosebleed
Swear I was raised by beasts like Mowgli
Came from the bottom, rats and the roaches
Now niggas blunts ain't as fat as my roaches
'Bout to go H•a•m y'all niggas just kosher
I’ma shark in the water see the fin and it's over...

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Ay bitch! They been sleepin' on me
Time for me to wake 'em up
Countin' all these fucking Bennies
'Till I get a paper cut
Kill the competition
I bomb 'em then I make 'em up
Only time we 'Black and Yellow'
When the 'caution' tape is up,
Ha! That record dead, memory of
Spittin' that crack, this really is drugs
It's hate in the air, I ain’t feelin' the love
You like a irritatin' fly; I’m killing your buzz
I’m eating the beat, this is Pacman
I’m on the grind like a mu'fuckin' lap dance
Shorty gon' do whatever, say she's a rap fan
Erry nigga 'round me: robbin' -- Batman
All black coupes, all black wheels
Step out the line, I'mma show you how that MAC feel
I’m like Cibelli on the corner in a backfield
Run, move or get yo mufuckin' cap peeled
Rollin' in this murder engine
Purrin' through yo neighborhood
Let my money do the talkin'
I ain't gotta say I'm good
Goonies that'll gun ya down
I ain’t gotta say I would
Ridin' like an engine bitch
I ain’t gotta say I’m hood...
I tell a ho to follow me or swallow me
I be spending money like I fuckin' hit the lottery
If I ever hit your girl then this is my apology
Cause suckas they be trippin'
'Bout these bitches tryna body me...

[Verse 3: Los]
I’m about to go: over 'round my arm
Leader winnin' I could feel it now
Towel around my head
Taliban knock ya building down
High cock blocker, I’m a fly top shotta
In my all red Range like a high top Prada
On my Momma's mouth through the drama
And life would be drippin'
From my lips as I'm spitting that shit
That Osama be grippin'
Hungry as a poverty stricken, robbery victim
With a Roscoe's 'waffles and chicken'
Winnin' 'Lottery Ticket'
And your girl let me pop it in real life
I 'Beat It' like they locked me in a room
With the doctor that killed Mike
I feel like: put me in a field let the field lights
Shine on the field now watch me kill all the field mice
I'm anthrax you Tampax, I'm 'bout to go Amtrax
Jack Black, blackjack, got the track Saran wrapped
Stand back I’m slammin' a antagonist
Slapping you faggots puttin' a can in the bandwagon it's:
Swag of the century, mack in a bitch or three
I heard the head was nothin' tryna crack it eventually
Rappers they mention me, boy I put this on my mother
You’ll end up Interscope, I'm just tryna Warner Brother
Still gettin' cheesecake on these dummies
Deal or No Deal, I got a briefcase full of money
Jahlil on the beat, Will hostin' this shit
And it's T. Lanez, Ink, Meek and Los in this bitch...

[Verse 4: Tory Lanez]
I, get any instrumental I get a switch in the mental
Ya bitch in the rental she positions my dick in her dental
Ya know my bitch is a yellow-bone, on Yellowstone
Double scoop, chocolate women on my vanilla cone
Yellin' cause I'm very gone, yes I'm on a cherry bone
Things seem quicker than a ping hit your Berry phone
Y'all don't wanna talk about ballin' bar-e-ly Larry Holmes
Money never growin' like a fuckin' young Gary Cole-Man
Veteran, batter up, bat her in, it's a
End to you rappers like the letter after M and I'm a
Lamborghini nigga, nigga you could never see me I'm the
Shhh, triple 'H'; you gon' have to pedigree me bitch I'm
Ready for the beef like it's some lettuce in between me
You got eenie meenie money, teeny like the youngest primie
And even if you niggas is trippin' still could never see me
Or beat me with three wishes and a mu'fuckin' genie
Scared? It ain't fair when I play a record on ya
Weird and you square; I could play checkers on ya
Rap-pers, y'all ac-tors
And I rip this track 'til it's tra-ck
I, rollerblade; let it ride
Show my face; televised
Dot to ya top like the lowercase letter 'i'
I fly higher than a sci-fi flyer
Fire like I'm five lighters, brighter than I hi-lighter
(Swavy) Oops, I'm in the loop for time
This a European whip check the coupe design
Time is money is the building and the truth inside
Goon shoot ya in ya head make ya lose ya mind, for real...

Said she like to smoke, I do too
Said she like to drink, I do too
So what you think, have a long conversation?

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Presidential suites and these foul blows
Livin' up and LIV, doin' what you do
Hangin' on and each of every moves
Detectives on my trail but don't have a clue
All I want is bad bitches, Mercedes Benz and millions
That's on the average
I'm ballin' with my lil homies, we smokin' lavish
Versace shirts, I remember we didn't have this
How I look now, all gold spinners, denim swarmin' foes
Stackin' money taller than my shawty low
I'm droppin' classes people nothin' shard go and go
Don't you be scared of me, baby 'cause all I do is ball

[Hook: Trey Songz]
But don't you be scared, girl, don't you be scared of a nigga

[Chorus: Game]
It's been a long damn time since a nigga sold dope
But if you put a brick right in front of me, I remember
Baking soda and a Triple Beam, I remember
Loaded fully auto-magazine, I remember

[Post Chorus: Future]
I done fucked so many bitches that I can't remember names
But if you put that pussy right up in my face
I remember, the way she put it down on the flo'
I remember the way she bring it down on the pole
I remember

[Verse 1: Game]
Pop the pussy don't play with it, I don't care if Kanye hit it
I don't care if Jay hit it, I'mma eat it up and I'mma lay wit' it
We shot a choppa' at the gun range, got stupid cars, got dumb change
Red bottoms, let the tongue hang, got a off-white Porsche, cum stain
I'm whippin' work (I remember), Roll up that Purp' (I remember)
Po' up that surp, (I don't remember) How Tunechi had that purple slushie
Comin' out that blender
Got a Keisha, got a Ronda, got a Neisha, got a Tanya, got a Teisha
And had a Honda, and I eat her Anaconda
Got condomds in that condo, got kush greener than Rondo
Still hit me up for that blow, You already know

[Chorus: Game]
It's been a long damn time since a nigga sold dope
But if you put a brick right in front of me, I remember
Baking soda and a Triple Beam, I remember
Loaded fully auto-magazine, I remember

[Post Chorus: Future]
I done fucked so many bitches that I can't remember names
But if you put that pussy right up in my face
I remember, the way she put it down on the flo'
I remember the way she bring it down on the pole
I remember

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Got a Rolls Royce, got a black Benz, Got a bad bitch, with some bad friends
She bring em' through and I fuck them, but I don't fuck with them in public
Got random bitches just walkin' up, they be like "Do you remember us?"
She show me that tat, on her ass, and I be like "I remember"
Chop it up, like a blender, I fuck then I befriend her
Got a red bitch call her Ginger, Ass and Cash on my agenda
You buy the bitch, we rent her, she took the cash and I sent her
That pussy prolly' so tight, callin that shit 'Illegal Tender'
(Hol' up, Hol' up, Hol' up, Hol' up), That's a young nigga dinner
Fish eyes to a fuckin' Lion, that's Visene, nigga never cry
We the young niggas wild'n out, talkin' shit to niggas that's 35
Yo daughter pull in my driveway, I smash that in overdrive

[Chorus: Game]
It's been a long damn time since a nigga sold dope
But if you put a brick right in front of me, I remember
Baking soda and a Triple Beam, I remember
Loaded fully auto-magazine, I remember

[Post Chorus: Future]
I done fucked so many bitches that I can't remember names
But if you put that pussy right up in my face
I remember, the way she put it down on the flo'
I remember the way she bring it down on the pole
I remember

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Fuck that, fuck shit pay me
Rumors come and go, so I stay in a room presidential lately
Top of the roof, if a nigga start hating
Talk that shit, I ain't for debating
Man I swear the game got so Clay Aiken
Bought a new crib, your bitch says it's spacious, Hagh
Ride to the motherfucking money (Yeah)
Man I swear this shit about nothing (Yeah)
Why you niggas ballin on a budget
Boy don't get close, I press that button mothafucka
Leave a nigga roughed up, David Ruffin, Hagh
Niggas washed up, start scrubbing
Nigga get you covered in some clovers
You're an unlucky, mothafucka
Don’t be fuckin wit a young nigga
That's T-Many, one fuckin problem
Really monsters need a doctor
I'm the sickest nigga bout it
No deciding, just a silence
On the sizzle, P90
Kill yourself like you're in college
It's finals; cocky
Bitch don’t fight it (Uh)
Volume turn to violence (Uh)
Cash money party, guess you broke niggas ain't invited
Got a bad bitch riding
She dumb but she get knowledge
I ain't come to be vibing but my personality vibrant
I'm in love wit nobody, white bitches, they hotties
Hop up off my crotch, I'm the shit, need a potty
She lucky she with me
Unlike them other niggas, I got it
T la-di-da-di, welcome to my house party

[Chorus: Tyga]
Fuck nigga, get yo bands up
Fuck nigga, get yo bands up
Fuck nigga, get yo bands up

[Verse 2: Honey Cocaine]
Yellow bitch and I got this
It's that black market, I'm shopping (uhh)
Last Kings and we bossing
Well I'm the first queen, there’s no option (Uh)
I heard they hating, I don't give a fuck
Tell 'em to fuck off and suck on my cunt
Bitch get some dick 'cause you doing too much
I'm getting mine and enough ain't enough
Getting richer
Money perfect picture
Oh no, I ain't messing at the studio with your ninja
Top the name, I diss her
Kill your bitch, you gon' miss her
Bring that body shop and now watch that coffin fit her
Funeral home, bring you to the zone
Get you and your crew, or just you alone
I don't give a fuck, I don't take no breaks
Body your ho, put her in her place
Now I'm out (uhh)
That Triad at your house (House)
Young gold Asian, and they know what I'm 'bout, bitch

[Chorus: Tyga]
Fuck nigga, get yo bands up

[Intro]
Ha
It's Gucci
Suckers keep on downing me
They know they should be crowning me
Hahaha
Yo
It's Guwop
Just counting paper, just counting paper
We're just counting the days, huh

[Verse 1]
80 chains going and ain't took one yet (Burr)
Ain't nothin' retarded 'bout Gucci but this gold Rolex (Huh)
A ten thousand dollar bounty put on my neck (Burr)
I hope you didn't pay them, 'cause they didn't have no success (Nope)
You seen my interview, nigga, and you got upset (R-I-P)
I seen your interview too, you looked oh-so-stressed
I think the nigga just mad 'cause I fucked his ex (Mwah)
And I'm a big dog, he got the lil' boy complex
Go dig your partner up, nigga, bet he can't say shit
And if you looking for the kid, I'll be in Zone 6 (Gucci)
I hit a birthday party fresh, you and your homeboy, Tip
I know y'all seen me over there with that black four-fif'
I bought a Bentley Mulsanne, it look just like Tip’s
But I never went platinum—do you catch my drift? (Skrrr!)
I never let a nigga do me like Tip did Flip (It's Gucci)
This the same shit that got Big and 2Pac killed, it's Gucci

[Interlude]
Haha
Okay
For the record, this is not a diss record
Just the truth
It's Gucci, the living legend
Oh, yeah
I'm a legend
Living legend, nigga
Respect that (Gucci)
Check!

[Verse 2]
I ain't playing with you, I ain't trying to dance with you (Fuck you)
I ain't using hands, let them rubberbands get you (Get 'em)
It take money to go to war, and we can go to war, nigga (Get 'em)
I ain't no real rapper, I'm a fucking gravedigger (Ha)
I'm a old-school fool, don't make me show my age, nigga
Grab a Louisville and turn it to a batting cage, nigga
I did a song with Keyshia Cole, and I know you still miss her (Yeah)
But Puff was fucking her while you was falling in love with her (Wow)
Call you to do a song, wouldn't even smoke no bud with you (Haha)
I was screaming "So Icey" and was a neighborhood nigga (Burr)
This AR is my backup 'cause I don't need nann nigga
Must didn't hear when Flocka said, "Let them guns blam, nigga!" (Bow, bow)
Used to drive to Birmingham with a lot of grams, nigga (Skrr!)
I'm just who I am, nigga, but I ain't sparing nann nigga
I know it's hard for you to sleep knowing you killed your homeboy
You left his son to be a bastard, won't even raise your own boy (Gucci)

[Verse 1]
Well I used to wake the mornin'
Before the rooster crowed
Searchin' for soda bottles
To get myself some dough
Brought 'em down to the corner
Down to the country store
Cash 'em in and give my money
To a man named Curtis Loew

[Verse 2]
Old Curt was a black man
With white, curly hair
When he had a fifth of wine
He did not have a care
He used to own an old dobro
Used to play it 'cross his knee
I'd give old Curt my money
He'd play all day for me

[Chorus]
Play me a song
Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
Well I got your drinkin' money
Tune up your dobro
People said he was useless
Them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker
To ever play the blues

[Verse 3]
He looked to be sixty
And maybe I was ten
Mama used to whoop me
But I'd go see him again
I'd clap my hands, stomp my feets
Try to stay in time
He'd play me a song or two
Then take another drink of wine

[Chorus]
Play me a song
Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
Well I got your drinkin' money
Tune up your dobro
People said he was useless
Them people all were fools
'Cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker
To ever play the blues
Yes, sir

[Guitar solos]

[Verse 4]
On the day old Curtis died
Nobody came to pray
Ol' preacher said some words
And they chucked him in the clay
Well he lived a lifetime
Playin' the black man's blues
And on the day he lost his life
That's all he had to lose

[Chorus]
Play me a song
Curtis Loew, hey Curtis Loew
I wish that you was here
So everyone would know
People said he was useless
Them people all are fools
'Cause Curtis you're the finest picker
To ever play the blues

[Verse 1: 2-D]
City life
Calling me all the time
Me and my soul
Geared to attack
Never get another chance
So what you doing
Gotta get money
Can't quite do it

[Hook: 2-D]
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness

[Verse 2: 2-D]
Shit  night life
Be trying not to laugh though
You won't get money
From doing what you loving
I'm moving out of city
Victim of a second chance
Get a lot of problems
We kicked a lot of them

[Hook: 2-D]
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness

[Hook: 2-D]
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness
Can't stand your loneliness, no not the loneliness

[Verse 1]
Ayye bitch, T-Raww
Bad bitch, fuck her better with the lights on

Me high off a molly, now I tell her fuck Big Sean
Psycho might go, niggas dont like no
Nigga getting money, want me dead like Castro
Jump her on my lap, then go yonkers to my odd flow
Top flow, telescope, watch her and die slow
(Fire flow) animal, cookie eat a rookie, I'm Geronimo
The diabolical, carnivore
Eat the shit now I got holla toast
Halitosis I'm dopest nigga you ain't know this
Drop 150 on the yacht
Master, I’m a massacre, the ice kill the watch
Fucking two bitches while my other bitch watch
My conceited bitch in London, she speaks so posh
Nigga this that T-naaa, nigga this that woo-ha
She fucked the whole crew, now the hoes 2 live
These days, too many lies, too many rhymes
Cashing out getting mine motherfucka, then I'm out
W-W-Well Done

[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, play that shit
What the fuck you doing Stretch
Gotta stretch your neck
You better protect it
I’mma Inspectah Deck
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ho, ho

[Verse 1]
Paul Where’s my words at
Yo see Slim Shady yo, where the birds at
Being flipped the middle ones
Rappers get these little ones in they mouth
These little nuts, yeah
Shit, I don’t care I ain’t afraid to admit it
I got a little dick yeah, but so do you
You scared to admit it
You won’t spit it on this mother friggen mic
Cause I will strike and smack your ass like a friggen fag
And I don’t care if you get offended
I never pretended to rock this microphone beef
You wanna start it now we’ll end it
Cause when I slip in the zone up on this microphone
People want me to do a written rap but fuck that go home
I don’t really give a damn I’ll kick right off of the top
And everything that I drop always gonna remain hot
Let on the spot, Slim, I mean woops, Grim it’s when im dim
Yo, I’m in affect mode
Rappers get they neck sewed
Get they whole threshold fucked up
Get they damn fleshed sewed
Ha, ha
I busted, I kill it, I crush it, I do it, the fluid, I spill it, I’m ill wit
These motherfucking rhymes that I be coming with and running with and kick you in yo motherfucking stomach with bitch
Cause you don’t want none of it
Rappers always try but they always die
And rappers always look to me and tried to lie
(Arf, Arf)
Yo, where my dogs at
Yo (err, ribbit) where my frogs at
In the house, It really doesn’t matter cause I still turn it out
When I step on this mic, smacking your spouse
Ha, Ha
The illest MC to come off the top
When I get this drum off
Yo Strech give me a break, let me catch my friggen breath
And till` the death, bust rhymes till` there’s none left
I’m wanted for theft and robbery
And probably smack a bitch up in the lobby G
Cause she don’t want none of me
I’m the illest MC to ever hold a cordless on the planet earth and you’ll see
That I’m from the friggen D
Ya’ll don’t get my point I’m from Detroit
Smoke your fake ass like a joint
That’s the first simplest rhyme I ever said in my life
But, at the end of the night I’ll still be fucking your wife
Shit, I really don’t care your style needs to switch
Cause you ain’t rich, that’s why you ain’t rich
Remain underground, can’t come off the top
You can’t drop rhymes nonstop like this
I might twist my friggen dick up in your ear
Rappers always wanna stand clear
I’m a motherfucking landmine
Ya’ll don’t understand mine
I’m Slim Shady showing out like my tan line
Ha, ha
The illest MC to rhyme
Every time the illest MC of our time
I rhyme time and time twice but I’m nice
With this mic device I slice right through your Adams apple
I had a Snapple and a motherfriggen syringe
Up in the bathroom I shouldn’t have but yo I boinked
To any MC up in this shit who want some
To any MC who wanna step up and get some
Get done, fuck competition
Let me catch my breath one more time
Yo, I’m on a mission
To stomp any MC comp I just trunked
And swamp is this truamp a word?, no its not
Yo, but here I go with this lyrical, lyricols, spiritual flows, that I flow so hysterical
Driving MC’s crazy, Slim Shady, up in your motherfucking radio baby

[Intro]
Uh, look, uh

[Verse 1]
We use to wear rugged boots now it's all tailored suits
Audemars piguets for my criminal recruits
Champagne flutes, bumpin' rhythm, and the blues
Partner made bad moves, he might end up in the news
Or end up in the tombs or living in the boondocks
Riding by the rules I'll abide by it soon
See the situation we﻿ sophisticated goons
Know you live by the gun then you die by it too
Niggas call me prophesy, swagging and philosophies
White on white wagon call that motherfucker Socrates
Rat ass nigga, fighting for a block of cheese
Catch me out in China stunning yea I'm about my guapanese
Shoe game serious so serious, bop her knees
Niggas say I'm blessed, my bad I forgot to sneeze
There your reasons though
Bitch, I got some tissues for your issues tell 'em blow this

[Verse 2]
She just started to pop it for 

[?] in the back and tell me baby I'm trill, yeah
I started to smack it and enjoy it and I'm lovin' the way that it feel, yeah
Chilling it with Westwood
And you know she like to get me cause I sex good
After that, we go in London town and shut it down
All my UGK the kings of the underground
Rollie and parolees, and parolees wanna stroll me
Woly woly holy, woah camoly bitches blow me
Niggas do all my dirt by my lonely, and you tony
You phony Toni baloney, I'm pimpin' macaroni
I swear, Sony, play 'em like a Playstation
Niggas think they taint hatin', I don't give a fuck I stay makin'
Don't let that tec, hit you in yo neck, came for that respect
Gimme the check, with some set bitches, all dank on that debt
And they sipping and they drinking on that motherfuckin' nectar
Swear I get these bitches with the heckler
And I'm chilling with my nigga Westa
Tim Westwood from the Westwoods
And I come through in your neck woods
In your neck of the woods, in the neck of the hood, in naked goods
And they givin' me goods on my wood

[Verse]
Ball so hard mothereffers wanna rob me
First effers gotta rob me
And you better come through with the police department and the army
Don't give a eff, 'cause I got the vest on my chest
And I'm not superman but I step when I through to the death
And I rep to the death better step to the left
Yes, yes what I do I'm fresh fresh, fresh to death
I'm the best when I dress, dress, dress to impress
What you say, you at left, and I put it to the TEC
To your brain to the right of your dome blow your brain to the left
Pop, pow don't give a damn and I came through the town
London town came to shut it down, king of the underground
Rolex on my left arm, on my right arm
Got your -itch on my right and we party all night
Last night I was with Trapstar and you know we party hard
And you know we had some laughs, couple giggles hearty har
Don't give a eff about these chicks
Tell 'em suck a "ehh" 'cause they on my tip
What you mean I flip, I flip, my watch tick tick, and she tick and tick
You don't wanna get in trip, you don't wanna mix with this
I will fight you, I don't like you, get like lightening what you mean?
And you know I come through in that super six, it sit so clean
On your TV screen, it's a dream
I can't hear nothing, turn it up 'til I scream
Where the volume at, put it to the max
Need to hear that bounce, bring it back

[Verse 1: Tyga]
It’s that one shell splatter, burst, splatter gun, ra tata tata
Tap dance off a ladder, leave my nuts splattered
On an apparatus, you's a faggot
Fat fuck her in the pansy; Vatican assassin
Your jaw bone inside a jar like molasses
Paranoia on you cause it’s blood on your fabric
Bitch stretched out backseat of a Navi
Holding your breath, cold sweats, nerve spasms
I’m sick, damn, it's the others
Couldn't save the bitch, killed the brother
Lesbians, two mothers, no need for rubbers
Red skin leather couch, couldn’t see a puddle
You’re not in my game, you’re too late for the huddle
I’m humble, get buried by the weight; shovel
All about my cake like a funnel
Do that shit
I’ve seen this shit all happen, but I’ve never been a witness
Problem might die, but I’ll never been forgiven
Purchases, can't cop it if it's already driven
Cop like Carl Winslow
Front seat of a Regal
Let them things fly like seagulls
You gonna feel it in the air like Sigel, nigga
When them shots - bang
Pick a condo, pick a condom
Fuck a bitch; man it ain't bout nothing
And she ain't bout nothing, then I’m done after nuttin'
Thank you for your time, and litterly fuckin'

[Verse 1]
We just broke up this shit is kinda new
I admit I'll still be riding through
I heard you got another nigga too
I seen his Benz, that 2009 shit
Plus your homegirl outchea fucking, she let all my friends hit
That's off subject, I know, fuck it, bring them papers, keep them dutches
Tell 'em haters they some busters, bad bitch then I bags it
Like I work out in Publix, got plenty girls so many girls
And pieces of me love it but some pieces of me doesn't
Guess that's a players nature, guess I holla at you later
Are you really done, I mean really done with me?
You said you will be here counting millions with me
Now you gone
My baby's gone you're gone
And I want for you to come on home
I'm going crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't act that, fresh snapback
My cup is full of Hennessy, just me and my Bentley
Windows down got a joint rolled
Where I'm 'bout to go a nigga don't know

[Chorus]
But I'm, but I'm sick of playing hard, I give up girl
Sick of fighting this war
'Cause I'm losing if I'm losing you
Can't shake, heart break, can't fake, baby wait
I'ma say it, I admit it girl, I've been a fool
Sick of playing hard, I'm sick of playing hard

[Verse 2]
I'm sick of playing hard but that's something that I can't help
Fucking all these broads, I'm disgusted with my damn self
My back you would massage, I miss how your hands felt
But the show's goes on, and thats even if the band left
Catch me in Miami, Puerto Rican with a dancer
Talk is something sexy but I never understand her
Te amo mami but yo no se, I'm lonely mami, I'm not okay

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't act that, fresh snapback
My cup is full of Hennessy just me and my Bentley
Windows down anotha joint roll'd
Where I'm 'bout to go a nigga don't know

[Chorus]
But I'm, but I'm sick of playing hard
I give up girl, sick of fighting this war
'Cause I'm losing if I'm losing you
Can't shake, heart break, can't fake, baby wait
I'ma say it, I admit it girl, I've been a fool
Sick of playing hard, I'm sick of playing hard

[Bridge]
I'm so sick of fronting like I don't miss you when you leave
And laying in bed at night, you even sexy girl, when you sleep
Feels a little crazy lying here alone
But I'm stuck on that nigga shit
That I be on, that I be on
And it's that nigga shit
That got me smoking, driving, drinking
Girl, I'm tripping, blowing up your phone

[Chorus]
But I'm, but I'm sick of playing hard
I give up girl, sick of fighting this war
'Cause I'm losing girl
Can't shake, heart break, can't fake, baby wait
I'mma say it, I admit it girl, I've been a fool
Sick of playing hard, I'm sick of playing hard

[Outro]
So uh, sick of playing hard
Yeah I'm just sick of playing hard
Without you feels a little crazy
Yeah, yeah, just, I just
I'm sick of playing hard

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Ayo dipset in London, right up on the youtube
I don't know why it don't got two million two views
That's a great video, chilling in this city though
'bout to do a sold out show, like I'm Diddy though
But I'm not my first name Mac, and if you heard that
My first time in London, I came back
Cause this is freestyle off of the top
And when I rip it on the mic I said your jaw gonna drop
This some biggie, chilling here in this London city
Girls pretty, everything I never smoked ??
Only smoking on that haze you be smoking on that phase
I got bars for days, everybody amazed
Cause every way I'm spitting is crazy
Cats all be rapping on their ish but it doesn't even amaze me
I just saw Kanye and Jay-Z live in Watch The Throne
Gotta girl and I gotta bone
You got a phone, I got two though
Shout out to Future, I copped Pluto
That's a great album, all up on that track
And I flip it back with some gymnastics

[Verse 1]
We were so dumb in love
Couldn't get enough, no
But I could've loved you so much better
And I can't believe you never walked out

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's not your fault

[Chorus]
That I fumbled your heart
Should've let go of my past for you
You did everything I asked of you
Drive across the country if I asked you to
But I'm just bad for you
I fumbled your heart
I'm bad news, yeah I'm just bad for you
I'm bad news, I fumbled your heart

[Verse 2]
Girl, you used to feel so bound in my arms
I wish we could touch some more, it's eating me alive
I'm sitting, working on this letter, I wanna put my feelings down
The first line I write, I was wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's not your fault
It's so wrong, it's so wrong, it's so wrong

[Chorus]
That I fumbled your heart
Should've let go of my past for you
You did everything I asked of you
Drive across the country if I asked you to
But I'm just bad for you
I fumbled your heart
I'm bad news, yeah I'm just bad for you
I'm bad news, I fumbled your heart

[Bridge]
It's all or nothing if you're my all or nothing
Well all of you are nothing, I'm sorry that I messed up girl
Really love you, really really love you, and now that I know I love you
I'll never love another girl and it's not your fault, no

[Chorus]
That I fumbled your heart
Should've let go of my past for you
You did everything I asked of you
Drive across the country if I asked you to, ever asked you to, I'm just bad for you
I fumbled your heart

[Outro]
She said I ain't gon' change
Ever since the day we met
And her mama said the same
I dropped the ball I'm so ashamed
I'm bad news, real bad news, I fumbled your heart
Verse 1:

Nigga I’m educated
I ain’t talking no college
Nigga I never made it
I ain’t smoking no garbage
Nigga I’m hella faded
I make a movie you niggas
Just stick to picture taking
Paper making while your stories all fabricated
Bitches in my section with they asses shaking
She just obsessing, we sexin Montego Bay Jamaica
I’m killing everything ain’t no need for a respirator
I’m getting cheese my nigga I’m such a cheddar maker
I got a crib in the woods living on hella acres
I’m still good in my hood from 36 to Crater
Come get some money you can fuck them dirty bitches later
You looking bum and start your sentence with "I need a favor"
I bet I shit on these niggas who wanna make a wager?
I’m on my shit on you niggas, I’m 'bout that paper label
I came up on you niggas I’m like a elevator
Rest in peace Nate Dogg I’m bumping regulator
I’m bout my business and my business style is now and later
Look in the mirror I say fuck a hundred thousand haters
Just left the club and they paid a hundred thousand baby
Nigga remember when I used to have a silver RAZR
The flip phone told your baby mama call me later
Huh cut her yeah I cut her now she call me razor
She got a bag of some shoes I did your ass a favor
Another bitch in my crew but she love a pussy eater
Her name caramel I treat her like my favorite flavor
Verse 2:
Uh, she say she stay poppin when she rockin with her girlfriend
Okay that’s okay, yeah you just go and bring your girl in
She say keep going like we was going to the world end
Left it on her neck right next to where her mama pearls is
Bottles and sparkles they coming back to back to back and back and back
I’m flipping dollars my paper remind me of a acrobat
Shoot for the stars maybe I fuck the lady astronaut
Toast to the broads they get they paper with they asses out
I’m in Atlanta yeah in Atlanta like my old crib
I’m going hammer, I’m going hammer like some toes is
This niggas cowards, these niggas acting like some hoes is
I want the power you want to sell out like my show is
I probably love her, yeah I love her like my last bitch
Beautiful mother fucker just look how big her ass is
Shout to the bitches where all my bitches you a bad bitch
These bitches sour, these bitches sour like the patch kids
Wait for the moment it’s never coming like the past is
Na na the past isn't, you niggas past missing
I'm reality rich, you niggas cash wishing
Nigga my palms itching, niggas you all bitches
I’m a stop right there
Whoop!

[Verse 1]
And the days are gone
When you and I would take a walk
Yeah, to the place where no one knows of

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I'm a ghost looking for you
It hurts but it's true

[Chorus]
That I will never, ever see you again
And I'll never, ever hold you again
In my arms, never, ever again
And I will never, ever feel you again
But I will always love you the same
My girl, never, ever again
I wish we had a little more luck in love

[Verse 2]
Now you are long gone
But I still got your birthday card
Yeah, with a stamp and no address

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh now I can't stop dreaming 'bout you
I'm a lost star without you
It hurts but it's true

[Chorus]
That I will never, ever see you again
And I'll never, ever hold you again
In my arms, never, ever again
And I will never, ever feel you again
But I will always love you the same
My girl, never, ever again
I wish we had a little more luck in love

[Bridge]
Suddenly it hits me hard
To the point where it breaks my heart
Such a major low
We're ever gonna touch again, no

[Chorus]
I will never, ever see you again
And I'll never, ever hold you again
In my arms, never ever, again
I wish we had a little more luck in love
Never, ever again
Never, ever again
Never again

[Intro]
Abstain
You got to abstain
Yungboyz

"Civility is not a sign of weakness."

[Hook]
I'm just trying to let y'all see the way
Abstain and y'all will see some better days
Don't mess with drugs or try to creep
Unless y'all want to end up six feet deep

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Big Sean 'bout to claim the game
When it comes to sex and drugs I stay abstain
I saw all my momma did for an easier world
I'mma mess it all up for a sleazier girl
Don't listen to these fast girls bringing drama
Cause they don't even want to be a baby momma
Listen, let me tell y'all 'bout Percy
Hustling on the corner selling coke and Hershey
Geared up too, straight down to his shoes
He had an E-class Benz on top of 22's
In his own head he thought he was lethal
Until he bumped heads with the wrong people
Now Percy was pissed, a push and a shuffle
A couple cats try to knock P for his hustle
To make a long story short, the gang got to his head
He heard a boom, he was dead
Shot, found under a bridge
Worst thing is he had a baby girl and a kid
Man, now how that sound to you?
Had a wife and a kid then his life was through
Caught up trying to make some money
For real, sex and drugs ain't even funny

[Hook] x 2

[Verse 2 - Part 1: Yungboyz (?)]
I'm a dozen years old, keep my ... froze
Abstain the game, I fall to thugs ...
Avoid the drugs, stop girls from pregnancy, stop boys from sex
All I know's the whole world's correct
All the pollution, stop the confusion
People killing each other for no reason, everyday of the season
Who's looking at the face of the Earth? - Uh
Who's looking at you smoking a blunt? - Uh
Who's looking at you doing bad things? - Uh
Who's looking at you flashing a ...

[Verse 2 - Part 2: Yungboyz (?)]
I run this beat like my name was Jay-Hova
Don't do drugs it will blow your mind over
Don't follow people when the streets dealing weed, it rude
Because your peeps looking straight at you

[Hook] x 3

[Outro]
R-J-98, it's great

Make that ass shake, shake it like it’s nervous

I swallow that pearl, tongue like I’m having a seizure
And I work hard, go harder, no father, no problem
Send my crew at your neck, like a t-shirt with no collar
Ho Holler, I’m poppin, red bone, you perfect

We are all gifted people, just don’t open the gift too early
She on her knees waiting for that nut like a verdict
Ahh, work hard, play hard, my dick stay hard, but suck my skateboard!

[Chorus]
She said I took way too long coming home last night
Said I be messing with all these women
I've been doing so wrong, wish I could make it right
Me and my bad decisions

[Verse 1]
Guess it's my fault for not believing she could love, love me
Hard to believe I treated someone beautiful so ugly

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess I broke to pieces her heart
Got used to seeing her crying
Guess I went and pushed it too far
She got sick and tired of me lying, yeah

[Chorus]
She said I took way too long coming home last night
Said I be messing with all these women
I've been doing so wrong, wish I could make it right
Me and my bad decisions
Now she's gone, gone, gone
I should've listened, but I didn't, me and my bad decisions
She said she move on, on, on
And now I'm tripping, I should've listened, me and my bad decisions

[Verse 2]
Now I got time to think of all I could've done different
Searched the whole world until I realized the one I needed was right there, I was tripping
Wanna what I know you know I love you
Don't I, never took the time to tell you
So I, know that shit don't even matter right now
'Cause I'm the reason that your heart's shattered right now
And I, I know how to fuck a good thing up
Ain't I, ain't that why I'm 'bout to lose your love
But that shit don't even matter right now
'Cause I'm the reason that your heart's shattered right now

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess I broke to pieces her heart
Got used to seeing her crying
Guess I went and pushed it too far
She got sick and tired of me lying, yeah

[Chorus]
She said I took way too long coming home last night
Said I be messing with all these women
I've been doing so wrong, wish I could make it right
Me and my bad decisions

[Bridge]
God knows I've done some wild and crazy things in my past
And I can't take nothing back
Can't take nothing back, forced to live with that
Pay the price for making bad decisions

[Pre-Chorus]
Guess I broke to pieces her heart
Got used to seeing her crying
Guess I went and pushed it too far
She got sick and tired of me lying

[Chorus]
She said I took way too long coming home last night
Said I be messing with all these women
I've been doing so wrong, wish I could make it right
Me and my bad decisions
Now she's gone, gone, gone
And I know that I should've listened but I, me and my bad decisions
She said she move on, on, on
And now I'm tripping, I should've listened, me and my bad decisions
I fucked up, no, no, yes I did
Me and my bad decisions
Ain't no way I could take that back
Me and my bad decisions

[Verse 1]
She grew up without a father
Never knew how to love a man
She's addicted to breaking hearts and moving on
Oh love, so I never really stood a chance, no
And a sparkle in your eyes, they shine so flawless
I'm amazed, blinded by an angel's face, oh
It's the sweetest poison in one kiss and now you got the venom in your veins
Believing everything her lips say

[Chorus]
Pretty girls lie
Lipstick in her smile makes you wanna believe
But pretty girls lie
Pain so deep inside, she can't even see
Pretty girls lie
Pretty girls lie

[Verse 2]
Got you walking through a maze, yeah
Eyes closed tryna find your way, ooh
Got your arms reached out, hoping she gon' make a sound
'Cause she don't wanna be found but she'll tell you come anyway, oh
And you don't know the difference from the real or the fake
Devil in a dress, but an angel in the face
They're forever yours but it's only for the day
Is it real when you calling my name?

[Chorus]
Pretty girls lie
Lipstick in her smile makes you wanna believe
But pretty girls lie
Pain so deep inside, she can't even see
Pretty girls lie

[Bridge]
Wanna give the benefit of the doubt
The best in her, I wanna help bring it out
I know something's missing inside
If she let me I can show and prove
Girl, it ain't no running from the truth
She says I'll be there
Girl, don't just tell me what I wanna hear

[Chorus]
Pretty girls lie
Lipstick in her smile makes you wanna believe
But pretty girls lie
Pain so deep inside, she can't even see
Pretty girls lie

[Outro]
Such a pretty face and she can't find her way
But you're a beautiful girl, lost in the world
Can't trust what she says
After so many break-ups and make-ups in life
Could've been making love but end up in a fight
Oh tell me why, pretty girls lie

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Think about the smarts, words said of wise
Do it like paz and I do it like Nas
You got two small fries by the size
And I get a gat, two times, two times, rap
Ratatat on your motherfucking back
Niggas know how I do it, A$AP
Gold chains, bitches give me brain
And I’m insane in the membrane man
Niggas bring pain and I might make it rain
I’m talking 'bout bullets I ain’t talking 'bout change
Oh shit, they whole style changed
They was looking at me, now they don’t rap the same

This is off the tip of the top of the dome
When I’m rapping miles deep
In the back, and you know I’m A$APing
Pants sagging, and I come through hop the band wagon
'Cause they love how I do it
I ain’t never been no faggot
And I gotta habit, tat off this habit
That I do and I get lettuce like cabbage
You talk about me, you up in my passing
And I got gliss on, you can call it carriage
You look embarrassed, tell me what your name is
Blat, blat, now a motherfucker famous
I ain’t change shit, leave you brainless
With this stainless
I’m on the same shit, that gang bang shit
Niggas who I hang with, is my crew
And I do, do the do, what it do
Chilling with Raheem, and I come through, with the high beam
And I’m sitting on that lean, and I got two bad bitches
But you can call them Siamese
Niggas know my name, niggas know the name
A$AP, Ant tell them what it is mane

[Verse 2: A$AP Ant]
I said flow like the ocean, sour weed potent
White girl actress, we fucking on Saturn
Henny got me blacking
Roller bands stunting, billboard fronting
Free clothes for nothing
Fire plate orange car glowing like a pumpkin
Low behind wheel, bucket hats hell
See you hundred horses, do it for the pleasure
Higher than a feather, coke that I measure
Put it on your tongue, it get no better
Flying over dodgers, chilling with the lowers
African soul, black diamonds boy
Got it from the source, be by the cake
I’m a boss, never take a loss

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Who shot them, red dot them
If I spot them, Raheem Duvaughn
You can call em Raheem dot them
'Cause he hit them with the beam not mean
Sitting on the top, looking at the top
Of the throne, better watch it
Keep your hand out my pocket, your crew
And you say I chew, so I bless you
And I got a new flow
You could call it special
And I might hit you with the TEC, TEC-2
And I got a bad bitch, who I sent a text to
Niggas know my name, it be rocky
And I’m flacko man, so call me papi
And Versace or Giv
