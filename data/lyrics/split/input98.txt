[Outro: PartyNextDoor]
Yeah, I might just pull up on you
I might just pull up on you, yeah
I might just pull up on you, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
A little drunk a little hurt inside
I went over to the forest
A little dope to start the open life
Felt obscure if I’m honest

I’m just a joke, just a punchline
That’s the will of the hunted
Just when I wanted to say no to life
She come in, and she’s on it
No, she said so

Yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
She said so
Yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)

And then I saw the colours and I saw the light
Explode above us into shapes and lights
Last I was broken, come back to life
It was all, out of you
Woohoo!
Come on baby we can dance all night
I got a lust for livin’ and a thirst for life
And it’s love that you give me
Makes me feel alive when you do
What you do
I feel reborn
(Till the break of dawn, we’ll be buzzin on)

A little broke a little hurt inside
I don't know if I'm wanted
Like a candle in the dying light
She said “come on with the courage, don’t give up” singin'

Yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
No, she said so
Yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
Now it’s all comin' clear

And then I saw the colours and I saw the light
Explode above us into shapes and lights
Last I was broken, come back to life
It was all, out of you
Woohoo!
Come on baby we can dance all night
Out from the chrysalis, a butterfly
And it’s love that you give me
Makes me feel alive when you do
What you do

I feel reborn till the break of dawn
We’ll be buzzin on
Till the break of dawn
We’ll be buzzin on

(Woah oh oh oh oh woah oh oh oh)
(Woah oh oh oh oh woah oh oh oh)
(Woah oh oh oh oh woah oh oh oh)
Kaleid-kaleid-kaleid-kaleidoscope

Kaleid-kaleid-kaleid-kaleid-kaleid-Kaleidoscope

And then I saw the colours and I saw the light
Explode above us into shapes and lights
Last I was broken, come back to life
It was all, out of you
Woohoo!
Come on baby we can dance all night
I got a lust for livin’ and a thirst for life
And it’s love that you give me
Makes me feel alive when you do
What you do
I feel reborn
(Till the break of dawn, we’ll be buzzin on)

[Verse 1]
Red and green is a Christmas queen
Make the holidays special to me
Oh, see the dancin' gingerbread dance in your head
Wait, wait, wait for the bells ring there
Now let me hear it out loud
Santa's coming to town

[Chorus]
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Wait for the bells
When you hear them, put the ornaments on a tree
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Wait for the bells
Wait for the bells, on Santa's sleigh to ring
Ho, ho, ho, ho

[Verse 2]
If...

[Verse 1]
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
I will try to fix you

[Verse 2]
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it show
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I, I will fix you
I, I will fix you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
I, I will try to fix you

[Intro: Nina Simone]
Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees
Blood on the leaves

[Verse 1]
I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
Now I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah, I told you to wait
So I'ma need a little more time now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah, I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me (Black bodies)
All want something out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you naughty
So let's get on with it

[Chorus 1]
We could've been somebody
'stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves
I know there ain't wrong with me
Something strange is happenin'

[Chorus 2]
You could've been somebody
We could've, ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it on the first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyer?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'nolia

[Bridge]
**** them other **** 'cause I'm down with my ****
**** them other **** 'cause I'm down with my ****
**** them other **** 'cause I'm down with my ****
I ride with my ****, I'd die for my...

[Verse 2]
To all my second-string ****, tryin' get a baby
Tryin' get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to JAY-Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyoncé, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like #Bad****Alert
He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
He only wanna see that **** in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she pregnant-ated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason 'cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz, you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table, you can't snort that
That go into that, all that money that the court got
All in on that alimony, uh
Yeah-yeah, she got you, homie, yeah
'Til death, but do your part, uh
Unholy matrimony

[Intro]
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were

[Verse 1]
Old man, look at my life
Twenty-four and there's so much more
Live alone in a paradise
That makes me think of two
Love lost is such a cost
Give me things that don't get lost
Like a coin that won't get tossed
Rolling home to you

[Bridge]
Old man, take a look at my life, I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me the whole day through
Oh, one look in my eyes and you can tell that's true

[Verse 2]
Lullabies, look in your eyеs
Run around the same old town
Doesn't mеan that much to me
To mean that much to you
I've been first and last
Look at how the time goes past
But I'm all alone at last
Rolling home to you

[Bridge]
Old man, take a look at my life, I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me the whole day through
Oh, one look in my eyes and you can tell that's true

[Outro]
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were

[Verse 1]
Sailing heart ships through broken harbors
Out on the waves in the night
Still the searcher must ride the dark horse
Racing alone in his fright

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay but young enough to sell?

[Verse 2]
Tell me lies later, come and see me
I'll be around for a while
I am lonely but you can free me
All in the way that you smile

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to makе arrangements with yourself
Whеn you're old enough to repay, but young enough to sell?

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay, but young enough to sell?

[Verse 1]
When you were young and on your own
How did it feel to be alone?
I was always thinking of games that I was playing
Trying to make the best of my time

[Chorus]
But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes, only love can break your heart
What if your world should fall apart?

[Verse 2]
I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream
Someone should call him and see if he can come out
Try to lose the down that he's found

[Chorus]
But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes, only love can break your heart
What if your world should fall apart?

[Outro]
I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream
Yes, only love can break your heart

[Verse 1]
Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor comin'
Sayin' something about a queen
There were peasants singin' and drummers drummin'
The archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowin' to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at Mother Nature on the run in the 1970s

[Verse 2]
I was lyin' in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eye
I was hopin' for replacement
When the sun burst though the sky
There was a band playin' in my head
And I felt like getting high
I was thinkin' about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie
Thinkin' about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie

[Verse 3]
Well, I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flying
In the yellow haze of the sun
There were children crying and colors flying
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream
The loading had begun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed to a new home

[Verse 1]
There you stood on the edge of your feather
Expecting to fly
While I laughed, I wondered whether
I could wave goodbye
Knowin' that you'd gone

[Bridge 1]
By the summer it was healing
We had said goodbye
All the years we'd spent with feeling
Ended with a cry
Babe, ended with a cry
Babe, ended with a cry

[Verse 2]
I tried so hard to stand
As I stumbled and fell to the ground
So hard to laugh as I fumbled
And reached for the love I found
Knowin' it was gone

[Bridge 2]
If I ever lived without you
Now you know I'd die
If I ever said I loved you
Now you know I'd try
Babe, now you know I'd try
Babe, now you know I'd try
Babe

[Verse 1]
Bad fog of loneliness
Put a cloud on my single-mindedness
I dream of sweet caress from you

[Verse 2]
What makes tomorrow guess
What makes me take from me and put aside the rest
I dream of sweet caress from you

[Bridge]
So long woman I am gone
So much pain to go through
Come back maybe I was wrong

[Verse 1]
Bad fog of loneliness
Put a cloud on my single-mindedness
I dream of sweet caress from you

[Verse 1]
Old man lying by the side of the road
With the lorries rolling by
Blue moon sinking from the weight of the load
And the buildings scrape the sky
Cold wind ripping down the alley at dawn
And the morning paper flies
Dead man lying by the side of the road
With the daylight in his eyes

[Chorus]
Don't let it bring you down
It’s only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around

[Verse 2]
Blind man running through the light of the night
With an answer in his hand
Come on down to the river of sight
And you can really understand
Red lights flashing through the window in the rain
Can you hear the sirеns moan?
White cane lying in a gutter in thе lane
If you're walking home alone

[Chorus]
Don’t let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around

[Chorus]
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around

[Chorus]
See the sky about to rain
Broken clouds and rain
Locomotive pull the train
Whistle blowing through my brain
Signals curling on an open plain
Rolling down the track again
See the sky about to rain

[Verse 1]
Some are bound for happiness
Some are bound to glory
Some are bound to live with less
Who can tell your story?

[Chorus]
See the sky about to rain
Broken clouds and rain
Locomotive pull the train
Whistle blowing through my brain
Signals curling on an open plain
Rolling down the track again
See the sky about to rain

[Verse 2]
I was down in Dixieland
Played a silver fiddle
Played it loud and then the man
Broke it down the middle

[Outro]
See the sky about to rain

[Verse 1]
I wanna live with a cinnamon girl
I could be happy the rest of my life
With a cinnamon girl

[Verse 2]
A dreamer of pictures, I run in the night
You see us together, chasing the moonlight
My cinnamon girl

[Verse 3]
Ten silver saxes, a bass with a bow
The drummer relaxes and waits between shows
For his cinnamon girl

[Verse 4]
A dreamer of pictures, I run in the night
You see us together, chasing the moonlight
My cinnamon girl

[Bridge]
Ma, send me money now
I'm going to make it somehow
I need another chance
You see your baby loves to dance
Loves to

[Verse 1]
I wanna live with a cinnamon girl
I could be happy the rest of my life
With a cinnamon girl

[Verse 2]
A dreamer of pictures, I run in the night
You see us together, chasing the moonlight
My cinnamon girl

[Verse 1]
I am a child, I last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile
You hold my hand, rough up my hair
It's lots of fun to have you there

[Chorus]
I gave to you, now, you give to me
I'd like to know what you've learned
The sky is blue and so is the sea
What is the color when black is burned?
What is the color?

[Verse 2]
You are a man, you understand
You pick me up and you lay me down again
You make the rules, you say what's fair
It's lots of fun to have you there

[Chorus]
I gave to you, now, you give to me
I'd like to know what you learned
The sky is bluе and so is the sea
What is the color whеn black is burned?
What is the color?

[Outro]
I am a child, I last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile

[Verse 1]
Be on my side. I'll be on your side
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me staying here all alone
When you could be taking me for a ride

[Pre-Chorus]
She could drag me over the rainbow
And send me away

[Chorus]
Down by the river I shot my baby
Down by the river
Dead, shot her dead
Shot her dead

[Verse 2]
You take my hand, I'll take your hand
Together we may get away
This much madness is too much sorrow
It's impossible to make it today

[Pre-Chorus]
She could drag me over the rainbow
And send me away

[Chorus]
Down by the river I shot my baby
Down by the river
Dead, shot here dead
Shot her dead, ooh
Shot her dead

[Verse 1]
Be on my side, I'll be on your side
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me staying here all alone
When you could be taking me for a ride

[Verse 1]
Is my world not falling down?
I'm in pieces on the ground
And my eyes aren't open
I'm standing on my knees

[Chorus]
But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I'll miss you

[Verse 2]
Turn me up or turn me down
Turn me off or turn me 'round
I wish I could have met you in a place
Where we both belong

[Chorus]
But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I'll miss you

[Bridge]
Sometimes I feel
Like I'm just a helpless child
Sometimes I feel like a king
But baby, since I have changed
I can't take nothing home

[Verse 3]
City lights at a country fair
Never shine but always glare
If I'm bright enough to see you
You're just too dark to care

[Chorus]
But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I'll miss you

[Verse 1]
She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
Zero hour: 9:00 a.m
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

[Chorus]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, I'm a rocket man
Rocket man!
Burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, I'm a rocket man
Rocket man!
Burning out his fuse up here alone

[Verse 1]
Saturdays involved making our entrances into life outside
We've been in this room too long
Recreation is keeping us self contained and aware
Of each other's forms
Still and in full strides just the same
Keeping us warm
Walking in straight lines
Talking to sleep at night
Coddled and pacified
By versions of mothers

[Refrain]
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you around
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you around the Higgs

[Verse 2]
What if we decide to live by choice?
All this time I knew
That average was something to fall back on after God еnds
I watch video; only differencе is
Oh, sparks of a lightning storm behind wet faces
Slipped my pants back on and rewind it backward more
I'll be back before
The street lights on, before the daylight's gone
I was spoiled by lavish thoughts
They don't compare, no, not at all
And had this been the past I might not know
What to do with all
Of what you've showed
What you give, my words can’t hold
And if acts of God breaks us apart
Least we did ours

[Part I]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I saw your eyes
Your eyes fall
You didn't wanna cry
So you kept your eyes closed
I could be great
I'm on my way
If I want escape
I can escape

I could be great
I'm on my way
If I want escape
I can escape, yeah

I could be great
I'm on my way
If I want escape
I can escape
I saw your eyes
I saw your eyes fall
You didn't wanna cry
So you kept your eyes closed
I could be great
I'm on my way
If I want escape
I can escape

I could be great
I'm on my way
If I want escape
I can escape

Coming down Fig
Turn left on Gage
I had an M5
Headlights were square like the Jakes
Race on a date
Race and sedate
I know you lie
You just don't lie to my face
I can't be great ‘til…
I can escape

Coming down Fig
Turn left on Gage
Had an M5
When headlights were square like the Jakes
Race on a date
Race and sedate
I know you lie
You just don't lie to my face
I can be great
What's that?
149
Oh, it's fast
Yeah
Cool
Yeah

[Part II]

[Verse 1]
I saw your eyes
I saw your eyes fall
You didn't wanna cry
So you kept your eyes closed
I could be great
I'm on my way
If I want escape
I can escape
We was on a date
I took you to McKenzie's
That's like your favorite
I don't like fried chicken
I don't want no Chick-fil-A
And I know they rob niggas
Can't do that drive-thru today
Coming down Fig
Turn left on Gage
I had the M5 when the
Headlights were square like the Jakes
Race on a date
Race and sedate
I know you lie to me
You just don't lie to my face
I can't be great ‘til I'm grateful for it
You just want hate, you got a gift for it
You don't wanna fight, you ain't built for that, huh
Yeah, roll call, you can see my hands
Jaws gon' break
Lip gon' bust, you like
“Why you snuck up on me
And ain't say nothing?”
I bit until my tongue gushed
I couldn't say 'I I—'
Huh? I ain't say nothing
I ain't say nothing
Get so paranoid
I ain't see nothing…

[Verse 2]
I used to play tough with the cops, had ideas
Told my girl who protest hold me a spot, and I'll go
Black folk know what talking white means, but still
Hold two open hands up in the sky, finger quotes
In my gangly youth my limbs used to swing like Polo tees
Mazal tov, still pop a bottle like what Puff did Steve
If you can't tote your own weight then what's this buff shit even ‘bout?
Crystals in your lil' feet, that's all that dust protein
Swoop Tremaine from Calabasas in a Brit sports car
We used to cypher in Marc Jacobs, had the library card
At Scott's comparing the silver spoons to plastic knives and sporks
I was the dog breathless chasing the car up the street
If I ever catch it I'll panic, that's the flaw in me
Nothing glamorous about growing up poor and naïve
Standing on the balls of my feet, trying to pray before I sleep

[Chorus]
Selling like red light pussy
Gotta waterfall douche it
Level head on the cushion
Light pink I'm revving
Light green, I'm someone like you, someone like me
Ring finger might sure get tooken
Wrist like springs, natural springs, water green indoor cookie
Other than me and you, ain't nobody else coming between, the glue stuck
We got the camera on Monday
We made a movie on Tuesday, fuck
We got the look, get looks
They never seen stars, the city too bright
Bright, bright, bright, bright

[Verse 3]
I try to sleep, can't get a lot
Make dreams bleed into days
The pressure couldn't stop
The bleeding I started seeing things
Watching out for demons
Blocked him like a screen, these plays
I was always reading, yeah
Then some hair grew where the sun don't shine
And I started feeling like pussy popping was the paradigm
Getting my dick wet, maritime
Lying on my virgin, Jergens moisturized
Gee whiz, gee whiz, gee whiz
All my friends is so, “No homo”
Blaze to trail behind
No heroes in front of mind
Just rappers who'd evolve with time
Looked up to them, knew all the rhymes
But at that time they enforced a bias
You know like some cops stop and frisk a guy
‘Cause he's brown, so of course he sides
With all the gangs these lames is extorted by
Switch lanes in the Porsche I drive
Let the police Ford Explorer by
Sirens screaming like they four or five
Throwing tantrums on the 405
Still on the whey like I'm tryna gain
Don't hibernate in the winter, that's where summer bodies are made
Just leg days like a sprinter
With the Bryan Baby blue interior
Big B's like GMO's
And they sting when my eyes close
All I see when my eyes close
Blame my emo on time zones
It's the same but different
Sets, twin siblings, head spinning
Exorcist

[Chorus]
Selling like red light pussy
Gotta waterfall douche it
Level head on the cushion
Light pink I'm revving
Light green, I'm someone like you, someone like me
Ring finger might sure get tooken
Wrist like springs, natural springs, water green indoor cookie
Other than me and you, ain't nobody else coming between, the glue stuck
We got the camera on Monday
We made a movie on Tuesday, fuck
We got the look, get looks
They never seen stars, the city too bright
Bright bright bright bright

[Bridge]
Praying Mantis
Fit by the Asians, wrist by Lorraine
Big Pharrell praying hands
Big P, big P
Buss down face, two levitating hands
I wanna see the money in cash
So that I can truly grasp
Thanking the savior, God did a favor
Big Pharrell praying hands
Big P, big P, big P, big P
Yeah, uh, Big P
Speaking of God, at ten years old, I switched church homes
Speaking of, speaking of God, speaking of God
Yeah, yeah
No one to talk me off the ledge
Had to get in my own head
Had to get in my own head

[Break]
You can go to the, uh
That
Whenever you feel like it…
The first one, the uh
Maybe keep it in four though
Uh huh

[Verse 4]
Speaking of God, at ten years old, I switched church homes
The bishop was tweaking, and we was Baptist
So how you a bishop? Like technically speaking
You drove a white Rolls, me and my family was type broke
The difference between having a home and not having a home was a tightrope
Visiting Catholic Churches, the masses was quiet as mice so
The minister spoke with no microphone
They had no choir, so silent I thought I heard Christ go
'You need a messiah'
Ran out the house from hormones, you seven months pregnant with Ryan
I figured I'd go to the East by my T for some peace and quiet
I ended up running the streets with my cousins, sitting in the back
Listening to beats, scheming on schemes that came to pass
They strategy murder yourselves, don't fall according to stats
I pray the new plots clear and thick as bulletproof glass
Cause the worst part of death is ambitions are dashed
Keep speaking death, it'll start to seem like the new car you wanna buy
It starts popping up on your way to work, see it all the time, always passing by
Call it playing Beetle-bug, yeah, it's on sight, better throw a punch
Running late to Teterboro, made the plane wait because it's no rush
Clouds floating over oceans from above
Kinda looks like bubbles on a tub
Kinda like…

[Intro]
This is Friday night, December the Fourth, New York City, part one of the evening concert

[Verse 1]
Be on my side, I'll be on your side
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me staying here all alone
When you could be taking me for a ride

[Pre-Chorus]
She could drag me over the rainbow
And send me away

[Chorus]
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Dead

[Verse 2]
You take my hand, I'll take your hand
Together we may gеt away
This much madness is too much sorrow
It's impossible to make it today

[Pre-Chorus]
Shе could drag me over the rainbow
And send me away

[Chorus]
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Dead
Ooh

[Outro]
Be on my side, I'll be on your side
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me staying here all alone
When you could be taking me for a ride

[Segue]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
I am a child, I last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile
You hold my hand, rough up my hair
It's lots of fun to have you there

[Chorus]
I gave to you, now you give to me
I'd like to know what you've learned
The sky is blue and so is the sea
What is the color when black is burned?
What is the color?

[Verse 2]
You are a man, you understand
You pick me up and you lay me down again
You make the rules, you say what's fair
It's lots of fun to have you there

[Chorus]
I gave to you, now you give to me
I'd like to know what you've learned
Thе sky is blue and so is the sea
What is thе color when black is burned?
What is the color?

[Outro]
I am a child, I last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile

[Segue]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
He's a perfect stranger, like a cross of himself and a fox
He's a feeling arranger and a changer of the ways he talks
He's the unforeseen danger, the keeper of the key to the locks

[Chorus]
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner

[Verse 2]
If you see him in the subway, he'll be down at the end of the car
Watching you move until he knows, he knows who you are
When you get off at your station alone, he'll know that you are

[Chorus]
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
There was a woman he knew about a year or so ago
She had something that he needed and he pleaded with her not to go
On the day that she left, he died, but it did not show

[Chorus]
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner

[Segue]
Right now I'd like to do a, uh
Just a little song that I wrote about a year ago
Never was, uh
I'm talking pretty loud
It was just a simple little song, never really got on an album or anything

[Verse 1]
I've been walkin' all night long
My footsteps made me crazy
Baby, you've been gone too long

[Chorus]
I'm wonderin' if you'll come home
I'm hoping that you'll be my lady
I'm wonderin' if I'll be alone
Knowing that I need you to save me

[Verse 2]
I've been workin' all day long
To keep my heart from sadness
But, baby, you've been away too long

[Chorus]
I'm wonderin' if you'll come home
I'm hoping that you'll be my lady
I'm wonderin' if I'll be alone
Knowing that I need you to save me

[Outro]
I'm wonderin'
I'm wonderin'
I'm wonderin'
I'm wonderin'

[Segue]
You'll— You'll have to— You'll have to pardon my little list of—
There's a lot of songs I'm gonna do tonight
I have to have it

[Verse 1]
There is a town in North Ontario
With dream, comfort, memory to spare
And in my mind, I still need a place to go
All my changes were there

[Verse 2]
Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leave us

[Chorus]
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Baby, can you hear me now?
The chains are locked and tied across the door
Babe, sing with me somehow

[Verse 2]
Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leave us

[Chorus]
Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless
Baby, can you hear me now?
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Baby, sing with me somehow

[Outro]
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless

[Segue]
Thank you
While we were in Washington
Last week
We stayed at the Mayflower Hotel
Which is the hotel where all the southern senators stay
I was hoping that I could, uh
Find George Wallace and sing this little tune for him

[Verse 1]
Is my world not falling down?
I'm in pieces on the ground
And my eyes aren’t open, I'm standing on my knees

[Chorus]
But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you’re from my side of town
And I'll miss you

[Verse 2]
Turn me up or turn me down
Turn me off or turn me 'round
I wish I could have met you in a place where we both belong

[Chorus]
But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you're from my side of town
And I'll miss you

[Bridge]
Sometimes I feel like I'm just a helpless child
Sometimes I feel like a king
But, baby, since I have changed
I can't take nothing home

[Verse 3]
City lights at a country fair
Never shine, but always glare
If I’m bright enough to see you, you’re just too dark to care

[Chorus]
But if crying and holding on
And flying on the ground is wrong
Then I'm sorry to let you down
But you’re from my side of town
And I'll miss you

[Segue]
It's feeding back
Somebody had a request for "Cowgirl in the Sand"

[Verse 1]
Hey, who's that stomping all over my face?
Where's that silhouette I'm trying to trace?
Who's putting sponge in the bells I once rung?
Taking my gypsy before she's begun
Singing the meaning of what's in my mind
Before I can take home what's rightfully mine
Joining and listening and talking in rhymes
Stopping the feeling to wait for the time
And who's saying, baby, that don't mean a thing?
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing

[Verse 2]
And who's all hung up on that happiness thing?
And who's trying to tune all the bells that he rings?
And who's in the corner and down on the floor?
With pencil and paper just counting the score
And who's trying to act like he's just in-between?
The night isn't black if you know that it's green
Who should be sleeping, but's writing this song?
Wishing and hoping he weren't so damned wrong
And who's saying, baby, that don't mean a thing?
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing

[Verse 3]
And who's coming home on old ninety-five?
And who's got the feeling to keep him alive?
Though having it and sharing ain't quite the same
It's not a gold nugget, you can't lay a claim
And who's seeing eyes through the crack in the floor?
There it is, baby, don't you worry no more
And who should be sleeping, but's writing this song?
Wishing and hoping he weren't so damned wrong
And who's saying, baby, that don't mean a thing?
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing

[Segue]
He's wonderful
After this song, we're gonna take an intermission for popcorn

[Verse 1]
There you stood on the edge of your feather
Expecting to fly
While I laughed, I wondered whether
I could wave goodbye
Knowing that you'd gone

[Bridge]
By the summer, it was healing
We had said goodbye
All the years we'd spent with feeling
Ended with a cry
Babe, ended with a cry
Babe, ended with a cry

[Verse 2]
I tried so hard to stand
As I stumbled and fell to the ground
So hard to laugh as I fumbled
And reached for the love I'd found
Knowing it was gonе

[Bridge]
If I ever lived without you
Now you know I diеd
If I ever said I loved you
Now you know I tried
Babe, now you know I tried
Babe, now you know I tried
Babe

[Verse 1]
When the dream came, I held my breath with my eyes closed
I went insane like a smoke ring day when the wind blows
Now I won't be back 'til later on if I do come back at all
But you know me
And I miss you now

[Verse 2]
In a strange game, I saw myself as you knew me
When the change came and you had a chance to see through me
Though the other side is just the same, you can tell my dream is real
Can you see me now?

[Outro]
Though we rush ahead to save our time, we are only what we feel
And I love you
Can you feel it now?
Can you feel it now?
Can you feel it now?
Ooh, can you?

[Verse 1]
Sailing heart ships through broken harbors
Out on the waves in the night
Still the searcher must ride the dark horse
Racing alone in his fright

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay, but young enough to sell?

[Verse 2]
Tell me lies later, come and see me
I'll be around for a while
I am lonely, but you can free me
All in the way that you smile

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to makе arrangements with yourself
Whеn you're old enough to repay, but young enough to sell?
Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay, but young enough to sell?

[Verse 1]
When you were young and on your own
How did it feel to be alone?
I was always thinking of games that I was playing
Trying to make the best of my time

[Chorus]
But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes, only love can break your heart
What if your world should fall apart?

[Verse 2]
I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream
Someone should call him and see if he can come out
Try to lose the down that he's found

[Chorus]
But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from thе start
Yes, only love can break your hеart
What if your world should fall apart?

[Outro]
I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart

[Segue]
Thank you

[Intro]
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were

[Verse 1]
Old man, look at my life
Twenty-four and there's so much more
Live alone in a paradise
That makes me think of two
Love lost, such a cost
Give me things that don't get lost
Like a coin that won't get tossed
Rolling home to you

[Bridge]
Old man, take a look at my life, I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me the whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes and you can tell that's true

[Verse 2]
Lullabies, look in your eyеs
Run around the same old town
Doesn't mеan that much to me
To mean that much to you
I've been first and last
Look at how the time goes past
But I'm all alone at last
Rolling home to you

[Bridge]
Old man, take a look at my life, I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me the whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes and you can tell that's true

[Outro]
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were

[Segue]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor comin'
Sayin' something about a queen
There were peasants singin' and drummers drummin'
The archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowin' to the sun
That was floating on the breeze
Look at Mother Nature on the run in the 1970s
We got  Mother Nature on the run in the 1970s

[Verse 2]
I was lyin' in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eye
I was hopin' for replacement
When the sun burst though the sky
There was a band playin' in my head
And I felt like getting high
I was thinkin' about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie
Thinkin' about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie

[Verse 3]
Well, I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flying
In the yellow haze of the sun
There were children crying and colors flying
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream
The loading had begun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed to a new home

[Verse 1]
Hello, cowgirl in the sand
Is this place at your command?
Can I stay here for a while?
Can I see your sweet, sweet smile?

[Chorus]
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same?
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game

[Verse 2]
Hello, ruby in the dust
Has your band begun to rust?
After all the sin we've had
I was hopin' that we turn back

[Chorus]
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same?
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game

[Verse 3]
Hello, woman of my dreams
Is this not the way it seems?
Purple words on a grey background
To be a woman and to be turned down

[Chorus]
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same?
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game

[Verse 1]
Old man sittin' by the side of the road with the lorries rollin' by
Blue moon sinkin' from the weight of the load and the buildings scrape the sky
Cold wind rippin' down the alley at dawn and the morning paper flies
Dead man lyin' by the side of the road with the daylight in his eyes

[Chorus]
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around

[Verse 2]
Blind man runnin' through the light of the night with an answer in his hand
Come on down to the river of sight and you can really understand
Red lights flashing through the window in the rain, can you hear the sirens moan?
White cane lyin' in a gutter in the lane if you're walking home alone

[Chorus]
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around

[Outro]
I just realized something
You people clap at the beginning of these piano songs, and I know for a fact that—
'Cause I don't pl— I mean, I don't play that good
I know all the introductions are all exactly the same
I just wanna get that straight, just so you know I know, you know?

[Verse 1]
Lover, there will be another one
Who'll hover over you beneath the sun
Tomorrow, see the things that never come today

[Chorus]
When you see me fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over
It's over

[Verse 2]
Nestled in your wings, my little one
Is special, morning brings another sun
Tomorrow, see the things that never come today

[Chorus]
When you see me fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over
It's over

[Outro]
I, I, you know, could do all those songs, you know?
But I havе new songs that I, I'm more interеsted in
I, I have, uh, outgrown some of those other songs

[Intro]
I'm gonna do this song on the, uh
On the Johnny Cash television program

[Verse 1]
Bad fog of loneliness
Put a cloud on my single-mindedness
I dream of sweet caress from you

[Verse 2]
What makes tomorrow guess
What makes me take for me and put aside the rest
I dream of sweet caress from you

[Bridge]
So long, woman, I am gone
So much pain to go through
Come back, maybe I was wrong

[Verse 3]
Bad fog of loneliness
Put a cloud on my single-mindedness
I dream of sweet caress from you

[Segue]
It's a song I wrote about the Kent State tragedy

[Verse 1]
Tin soldiers and Nixon comin'
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drummin'
Four dead in Ohio

[Chorus]
Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are cutting us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her and
Found her dead on the ground?
How can you run when you know?

[Verse 2]
Ooh ooh,  ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh,  ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ah, ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Ah, ah ah ah, ah ah

[Chorus]
Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are cutting us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her and
Found her dead on the ground?
How can you run when you know?

[Verse 1]
Tin soldiers and Nixon comin'
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drummin'
Four dead in Ohio

[Chorus]
See the sky about to rain
Broken clouds and rain
Locomotive, pull the train
Whistle blowin' through my brain
Signals curlin' on an open plain
Rollin' down the track again
See the sky about to rain

[Verse 1]
Some are bound for happiness
Some are bound to glory
Some are bound to live with less
Who can tell your story?

[Chorus]
See the sky about to rain
Broken clouds and rain
Locomotive, pull the train
Whistle blowin' through my brain
Signals curlin' on an open plain
Rollin' down the track again
See the sky about to rain

[Verse 2]
I was down in Dixieland
Played a silver fiddle
Played it loud and then the man
Broke it down the middle

[Outro]
See the sky about to rain

[Verse 1]
Never thought love had a rainbow on it, used to think a cloud was a nightmare
That was up until when I first met you, now I go around hoping you care

[Chorus]
Dance, dance, feel it all around you, dance, dance, dance
Never thought love had a rainbow on it, see the girl dance

[Verse 2]
Mississippi mud never touched her fingers, California sand lies in her hand
Love her more than life as the daylight lingers, early in the morning, I'll be her man

[Chorus]
Dance, dance, feel it all around you, dance, dance, dance
Mississippi mud never touched her fingers, see the girl dance
See the girl dance
Dance, dance, feel it all around you, dance, dance, dance
Never thought love had a rainbow on it, see the girl dance

[Lyrics from snippet]
I'll be on my way
Give you love like ain't nobody could give you enough strain
Baby it ain't no thing, no thing, no thing, no thing
You—

[Verse 1]
There is a town in North Ontario
With dream, comfort, memory to spare
And in my mind, I still need a place to go
All my changes were there

[Verse 2]
Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leave us

[Chorus]
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Babe, can you hear me now?
The chains are locked and tied across the door
Babe, sing with me somehow

[Verse 2]
Blue, blue windows bеhind the stars
Yellow moon on the risе
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leave us

Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless

[A Man Needs a Maid]

[Verse 1]
I was thinkin' that maybe I'd get a maid
Find a place nearby for her to stay
Just someone to keep my house clean
Fix my meals and go away

[Chorus]
Afraid
A man feels afraid
Afraid

[Post-Chorus]
It's hard to make that change
When life and love turns strange and cold

[Verse 2]
To give a love
You gotta live a love
To live a love
You gotta be part of
And when will I see you again?

[Verse 2]
A while ago somewhere I don't know when
I was watchin' a movie with a friend
I fell in love with the actress
She was playing a part I could understand

[Chorus]
A maid
A man needs a maid
A maid

[Heart of Gold]

[Verse 3]
I want to live, I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions I never give
That keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

[Verse 4]
I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwoods
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line
That keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

[Outro]
I want to live, I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold

And when will I see you again

[Chorus]
See the sky about to rain
Broken clouds and rain
Locomotive, pull the train
Whistle blowin' through my brain
Signals curlin' on an open plain
Rollin' down the track again
See the sky about to rain

[Verse 1]
Some are bound to happiness
Some are bound to glory
Some are bound to live with less
Who can tell your story?

[Chorus]
See the sky about to rain
Broken clouds and rain
Locomotive, pull the train
Whistle blowin' through my brain
Signals curlin' on an open plain
Rollin' down the track again
See the sky about to rain

[Verse 2]
I was down in Dixieland
Played a silver fiddle
Played it loud and then the man
Broke it down the middle

[Outro]
See the sky about to rain

[Verse 1]
Be on my side, I'll be on your side
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me staying here all alone
When you could be taking me for a ride

[Pre-Chorus]
She could drag me over the rainbow
And send me away

[Chorus]
Down by the river, I shot my baby
Down by the river
Dead

[Verse 2]
You take my hand, I'll take your hand
Together we may get away
This much madness is too much sorrow
It's impossible to make it today

[Pre-Chorus]
She could drag me over the rainbow
And send me away

[Chorus]
Down by the river, I shot my baby
Down by the river

[Verse 3]
Be on my side, I'll be on your side
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me staying here all alone
When you could be taking me for a ride

[Verse 1]
I went into town to see you yesterday
But you were not home
So I talked to some old friends for a while
Before I wandered off alone

[Chorus]
It's so hard for me now
But I'll make it somehow
Though I know I'll never be the same
Won't you ever change your ways
It's so hard to make love pay
When you're on the losing end
And I feel that way again

[Verse 2]
Well, I miss you more than ever
Since you've gone, I can hardly maintain
Things are different round here every night
My tears fall down like rain

[Chorus]
It's so hard for me now
But I'll make it somehow
Though I know I'll never be the same
Won't you ever change your ways
It's so hard to make love pay
When you're on the losing end
And I feel that way again
Well light that pipe

[Guitar and Pedal Steel Solos]

[Verse 1]
I went into town to see you yesterday
But you were not home
So I talked to some old friends for a while
Before I wandered off alone

[Chorus]
It's so hard for me now
But I'll make it somehow
Though I know I'll never be the same
Won't you ever change your ways
It's so hard to make love pay
When you're on the losing end
And I feel that way again

[Intro]
I need time, love, joy
I need space, love
I need... me
(Action!)

[Verse 1]
Say hello to the girl that I am
You're gonna have to see through my perspective
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am
And I don't wanna be so damn protected

[Pre-Chorus]
There must be another way
'Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say what a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers

[Chorus]
What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected

[Verse 2]
I'll tell 'em what I like, what I want, and what I don't
But every time I do, I stand corrected
Things that I've been told, I can't believe what I hear about the world
I realize I'm overprotected

[Pre-Chorus]
There must be another way
'Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say what a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers

[Chorus]
What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel (Help the way I feel)
But my life has been so overprotected

[Interlude]
I need time, love
I need space
(This is it)

[Bridge]
I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna
What I, what, what, what I'm gonna (I need) do about my destiny
I say no, no, nobody's telling me just what I wanna do, do
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be someone else but me (Action!)

[Chorus]
What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected

[Bridge]
I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna
What I, what, what, what I'm gonna do about my destiny
I say no, no, nobody's telling me just what I wanna do, do
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be someone else but me

[Chorus]
What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel (Oh, I can't help the way I feel)
But my life has been so overprotected

[Intro]
For whatever reason
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life
You don't understand
I'm so glad we're at the same place at the same time
It's over now

[Verse 1]
I spotted you dancing, you made all the girls stare
Those lips and your brown eyes (ooh), and the sexy hair
I shake, shake my thing, and make the world want you
Tell your boys you'll be back, I wanna see what you can do

[Pre-Chorus]
What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not tryna sound conceited, but me and you were meant to be
You'rе a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl (Don't you know?)
Let's turn this dancе floor into our own little nasty world

[Chorus]
Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one (You know I need you)
Boys, to love her and to hold (I just want you to touch me)
Boys, and when a girl is with one
Boys, then she's in control

[Verse 2]
Took the boy off the dance floor, screaming in his ear
Must've said something 'bout me 'cause he's looking over here (What you say?)
You looking at me with that sexy attitude
But the way your boy's moving it, it puts me in the mood (Ow!)

[Pre Chorus]
What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not tryna sound conceited, but me and you were meant to be
(Don't you know?)
You're a sexy guy (ooh), I'm a nice girl (Don't you know?)
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world

[Chorus]
Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one (I get nasty)
Boys, to love her and to hold (I get nasty)
Boys, and when a girl is with one (I get nasty)
Boys, then she's in control
(You like that? Here we go)

[Bridge 1]
Tonight, let's fly, boy, have no fear (Have no fear)
There's no time to lose (Baby, what are you waiting for?)
And next week, you may not see me here (Uh-uh)
So, boy, just make your move (Let me see what you can do)

[Chorus]
Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one
Boys, to love her and to hold (The way you move)
Boys, and when a girl is with one (It's gon' turn me on)
Boys, then she's in control

[Bridge 2]
Come with me, let's fly into the night
Oh, boy, tonight is ours (It's just you and me, baby)
Keep loving me, make sure you hold me tight
Let's head for the stars (Get nasty)
Ow!

[Chorus]
Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one
Boys, to love her and to hold (Get nasty)
Boys, and when a girl is with one (Get nasty)
Boys, then she's in control

[Outro]
Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em

[Verse 1]
Hello, cowgirl in the sand
Is this place at your command?
Can I stay here for a while?
Can I see your sweet sweet smile?

[Chorus]
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same?
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game

[Verse 2]
Hello, ruby in the dust
Has your band begun to rust?
After all the sin we've had
I was hopin' that we turn back

[Chorus]
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same?
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game

[Verse 3]
Hello, woman of my dreams
Is this not the way it seems?
Purple words on a grey background
To be a woman and to be turned down

[Chorus]
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you, is it the same?
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game

[Verse 1]
Don't call pretty Peggy, she can't hear you no more
Don't leave no message around her back door
They say the old laughing lady been here before
She don't keep time, she don't count score

[Verse 2]
You can't have a cupboard if there ain't no wall
It's time to move, there's none left for you to stall
They say the old laughing lady dropped by to call
And when she leaves, she leaves nothing at all

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 3]
See the drunkard of the village falling on the street
He can't tell his ankle from the rest of his feet
He loves his old laughing lady 'cause her taste is so sweet
Ah but that laughing lady's loving ain't the kind he can keep

[Verse 4]
There's a fever on the freeway, blacks out the night
There's a slippin' on the stairway just don't feel right
There's a rumbling in the bedroom and a flash of light
There's the old laughing lady, everything is all right

[Outro]
Oh guilty train, don't whistle my way again
Oh guilty train, don't whistle my way again

[Verse 1]
Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor comin'
Sayin' something about a queen
There were peasants singin' and drummers drummin'
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun
That floated on the breeze
Look at Mother Nature on the run in the 1970s
We got Mother Nature on the run in the 1970s

[Verse 2]
I was lying in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eye
I was hopin' for replacement
When the sun burst though the sky
There was a band playing in my head
And I felt like getting high
Thinking about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie
Thinking about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flying
In the yellow haze of the sun
There were children crying and colors flying
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream
The loading had begun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed to a new home

[Verse 1]
When I woke up you were gone
And the sun was on the lawn
Empty pillow with perfume on
I smelled it
We met in my favorite bar
And we drove in my favorite car
I don't know how we made it home

[Chorus]
Was I too far gone?
Too far gone
Too far gone
For you
Was I too far gone?
Too far gone
Too far gone
For you

[Verse 2]
We had drugs and we had booze
But we still had somethin' to lose
And by dawn I wanted to marry you
With our attitudes by day
And our secret dreams by night
Can we really live a life that way

[Chorus]
Am I too far gone?
Am I too far gonе?
Too far gone
For you
Too far gone
Am I too far gone?
Too far gonе
For you

[Intro]
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I’m a lot like you were

[Verse 1]
Old man, look at my life
Twenty-four, and there's so much more
Live alone in a paradise
That makes me think of two
Love lost is such a cost
Give me things that don't get lost
Like a coin that won’t get tossed
Rolling home to you

[Chorus]
Old man, take a look at my life, I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me the whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes and you can tell that's true

[Verse 2]
Lullabies, look in your eyes
Run around the same old town
Doesn't mean that much to me
To mean that much to you
I've been first and last
Look at how the time goes past
But I'm all alone at last
Rolling home to you

[Chorus]
Old man, take a look at my life, I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me the whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes and you can tell that's true

[Outro]
Old man, look at my life
I’m a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I’m a lot like you were

[Intro]
Uh, play that shit, ooh
Ahh

[Verse 1]
Look at what you started
You pulling me close
But you was just dancing on your own
And if I'm being honest
I was about to go home
The way you lick your lips, I know we on

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don’t need nobody
To tell me they love me
Yeah, I can leave alone, and I know that I might
I don't need nobody
To tell me they love me
Yeah, I can leave alone, but I know that tonight!

[Chorus]
It's better with you (Ooh-ooh, better, better)
Better with you (Ooh-ooh, better, better)
Better when we lost in thе low light
Dancing on my own don’t feel right
It's better with you (Ooh-ooh, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I was on my pimp shit
Nеver sleeping alone
But I didn't know my heart belonged to you
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
About to make you my Ms
I can take you home
But I been feeling the way I do

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't need nobody
To tell me they love me
Yeah, I can leave alone, and I know that I might
I don't need nobody
To tell me they love me
Yeah, I can leave alone, but I know that tonight!

[Chorus]
It's better with you (Ooh-ooh, better, better)
Better with you (Ooh-ooh, better, better)
Better when we lost in the low light
Dancing on my own don't feel right
It's better with you (Seems better)

[Bridge]
I swear, babe
It’s getting late, you should be leaving
’Cause you make it hard to be apart
So love like you mean it (So love like you mean it)
Girl, It's getting late, you should be leaving
’Cause you make it hard to be apart
So love like you mean it

[Chorus]
It's better with you (Ooh-ooh, better, better)
It's better with you (Baby, ooh-ooh, better, better)
It's better when we lost in the low light (Light)
Dancing on my own don’t feel right
It's better with you (Ooh-ooh, better, better)
It's better with you (Better with you, babe)

[Outro]
I never seem much better with you, baby
I never seem much better with you, baby (Better with you)
Better better better than us (Ooh-ooh, it's better with you)
Never seem much better, never seem much better with you, baby
Never seem much better with you, baby (Ooh-ooh, it's better with you)
Never seem much better with you, baby
Yeah, yeah oh

Oh I was broken-hearted
Feeling sad and all alone
I thought I was going crazy, baby

I thought the pain would last forever
I thought he'd never ever hurt me, and hurt me
Over and over again

Oh
When you tried into my world
You showed the loving ways of how
A guy should treat a girl
The love you give that makes me breathe again

I've found someone who feels me
An understanding friend till the end

I know the future no one can see
But I feel deep in my heart
You will stay with me eternally
So just love me
Even every day
And hold me in your arms now
Please love the hurt away

I'll make it go away, yes I will
Oh hurt away (oh)

I see heaven in your eyes
Tell me why would he make you cry, and lie
He must have been out of his mind

I would never hurt you baby
Don't let one fool turn you cold (oh no)
You've got a heart of gold

Heart of gold
I love everything about you
All I know is

Every word I take it straight to you
A special part I give for everything I do

Nobody else comes close to the love you give
Body and soul
I'm gonna love you for as long as I live
And I know
It's not easy letting go (No, it's not easy)
But I won't let you fall
Together you and me
We've got it all

I just love you
More and more each day
I rest my head on your shoulder
Please love the hurt away

Love the hurt away

I know
I know the future no one can see
But I feel deep in my heart
You will stay with me eternally

I just love you
More and more each day

(No, oh) Please love the hurt away (oh yeah)
Oh my love
Love the hurt away (oh oh yeah)

Please love the hurt away

[Intro]
Yeah, oh

[Verse 1]
It's all about the way you're feelin'
Deep in your heart
When she let you go
I don't doubt you care
Believe that
It tears you apart
What you didn't know, oh-oh
Some day you'll remember
Why you fell for her
Why you said goodbye
Don't let your broken heart keep forever mending
And miss out on love that is never ending, yeah

[Chorus]
This could be your final heartbreak
I could show you what good love takes
Never say goodbye
Never make you cry
Yeah, this could bе your final heartbreak

[Post-Chorus]
This could be
Your final hеart
Your final heartbreak

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna take advantage
Or maybe I do (Or maybe I do)
And I know it's true
That I can help undo the damage
All of the hurt (All of the hurt)
That she did to you, baby
You need someone you can talk to
Someone who feels the same
About everything you do
And I could be the one to make you forget her
I wanna be the one to make you feel better, yeah

[Chorus]
This could be your final heartbreak (This could be)
I could show you what good love takes (I'll never say)
Never say goodbye
Never make you cry
Yeah, this could be your final heartbreak

[Bridge]
I'll let you feel a love so real
I'll let you know
Oh-oh, I gotta let you know
You will forget, she will regret
Letting you go (Oh yeah)
I will not let you go
This could be

[Chorus]
This could be your final heartbreak (I could)
I could show you what good love takes
Never say goodbye
Never make you cry
Yeah, this could be your final heartbreak
(Yeah, this could be your final, baby)
This could be your final heartbreak
I could show you what good love takes (I'll never say)
Never say goodbye
Never make you cry
Yeah, this could be your final heartbreak

[Outro]
This could be your final heartbreak (Heartbreak)
I could show you what good love takes (Never say)
Never say good bye
Never make you cry
Yeah, this could be your final heartbreak
Yeah, this could be your final heartbreak
Keep telling myself
Get out of my mind
The way it feels
It feels so right
And every night
I feel the heat
Close my eyes
And it comes to me
I confess if I've done it wrong
But in your eyes I see I'm guilty
I'm guilty
The stress that keeps me strong
I feel as though
My heart is empty
Cause you're not with me
In my secret place
Where I drift away
Tell me am I a sinner?
Tell me am I wrong?
Something is wrong with the picture
This is not my fault
So am I a sinner?
Am I a sinner?
Don't watch the truth unfold
Plеase don't try to see right through me
When u touch mе
You will never know
Imagination starts to haunt me
It controls me
In my secret place
Where I drift away
Tell me am I a sinner?
Tell me am I wrong?
Something is wrong with the picture
This is not my fault
So am I a sinner?
Am I a sinner?
Am I a sinner?
Am I a sinner?
Just tell me
Am I a sinner?
Tell me am I a sinner?
Tell me am I wrong?
Something is wrong with the picture
This is not my fault
So am I a sinner?
Tell me am I a sinner?
Tell me am I wrong?
Something is wrong with the picture
This is not my fault
So am I a sinner?
Am I a sinner?
Am I a sinner
Am I a sinner
Am I a sinner
Just tell me
Am I a sinner
You know I'm one of a kind

Hey, boy, what is this I see?
Your girl – she looks just like me
Blond hair and dressed to a T
You tell me how can this be
Does she know I was the one
Who used to turn you on
Yeah
But you don't want to talk about it

Well you think you can find
Someone to fill my shoes
And you ask yourself why
She don't do the things I do
And you can't deny
That everywhere you go
You see my face, hear my name
And it eats you up inside

You know I'm one of a kind
There'll never be another me
Can't get me out of your mind
You're lost in your own fantasy
And when you look in my eyes
Is it hard for you to realize
She'll never be me
Why can't you see it girl?
Got no identity
Whenever he's touching you
He's really thinking of me
Do you know I am the one
Who used to turn him on, yeah
But you don't want to talk about it

And the way you must feel
You got to be confused
And you ask yourself why
You can't do the things I do
And you can't deny
That everywhere you go
You see my face, hear my name
And it eats you up inside

You know I'm one of a kind
There'll never be another me
Can't get me out of your mind
You're lost in your own fantasy
And when you look in my eyes
Is it hard for you to realize
She'll never be me

Don't you think that she would see through you
But you don't want to think about it
Try so hard to do the things I do
But you don't want to think about it
You know I'm one of a kind
There'll never be another me
Can't get me out of your mind
You're lost in your own fantasy
And when you look in my eyes
Is it hard for you to realize
She'll never be me

You know I'm one of a kind
There'll never be another me
Can't get me out of your mind
You're lost in your own fantasy
And when you look in my eyes
Is it hard for you to realize
She'll never be me

She'll never be me

[Verse 1]
Confidence is a must
Cockiness is a plus
Edginess is a rush
Edges, I like them rough
A man with a Midas touch
Intoxicate me, I'm a lush
Stop, you're making me blush
People are looking at us

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think you know (Know)

[Chorus]
I'm checking you, so hot, so hot
Wonder if you know you're on my radar (On my radar)
On my radar (On my radar)
And yep, I notice you
I know it's you I'm choosing
Don't wanna lose you, you on my radar (On my radar)

[Post-Chorus]
On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar

[Verse 2]
Interesting sense of style
Ten million dollar smile
Think I can’t handle that animal in the sack
His eyes see right to my soul
I surrender self-control
Catch me looking again
Falling right into my plan

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think you know (Know)

[Chorus]
I'm checking you, so hot, so hot
Wonder if you know you're on my radar (On my radar)

Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar

[Spoken Interlude]
I got my eye on you
And I can’t let you get away

[Bridge]
Hey baby, whether it's now or later (I gotcha)
You can’t shake me (No)
'Cause I got you on my radar
And whether you like it or not, it ain't gonna stop
'Cause I got you on my radar (I gotcha)
'Cause I got you on my radar

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Me, now...

[Verse 1]
Hey, over there
Please forgive me if I'm coming on too strong
Hate to stare, but you're winning
And they're playing my favorite song
So come here, a little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, a little question
Wanna know just how you feel

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

[Verse 2]
Hey, you might think that I'm crazy
But you know I'm just your type
I might be a little hazy
But you just cannot dеny
There's a spark in-between us
Whеn we're dancing on the floor
I want more, wanna see it
So, I'm asking you tonight

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

[Spoken Interlude]
If I said I want your body, would you hold it against me?

[Bridge]
Give me something good
Don't wanna wait, I want it now
Drop it, like a hood
And show me how you work it out

[Breakdown]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

[Outro]
Would you hold it against me?
Would you hold it against me?
Would you hold it against me?
Would you hold it against me?

[Verse 1]
Lately, I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out
Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out

[Pre-Chorus]
Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

[Chorus]
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind, woah
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind, whoa
Shame on me

[Verse 2]
Lately, people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out
I've been told just what to do with it
To keep both my hands above the blanket
When the light's out

[Pre-Chorus]
Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

[Chorus]
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind, whoa

[Breakdown]
Shame on me (Shame on me)
To need release (To need release)
Uncontrollably (Uncontrollably, -lably, -lably, -lably...)

[Chorus]
I wanna go (I wanna go...) all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show (I wanna show...) all the dirt I got running through my mind
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind, whoa
Lately I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out

Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa
Lately people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out

I've been told do what you do with it
We keep both my hands above the blanket
When the light's out

Shame on me
To need rеlease
Uncontrollably

I wanna go all the way
Taking out my frеak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa

[Verse 1: Britney Spears with Madonna]
And no one cares
It's whippin' my hair, it's pullin' my waist
To hell with stares
The sweat is drippin' all over my face
And no one's there
I'm the only one dancin' up in this place
Tonight I'm here
Feel the beat of the drum, gotta keep it that bass
I'm... (I’mma take you on, I’mma take you on)

[Verse 1]
Out of my mind
And I just can't take it anymore
Left behind
By myself and what I'm living for
All I hear are screams from outside the limousines
That are taking me

[Verse 2]
Out of my mind
Through the keyhole in an open door
Happy to find
That I don't know what I'm smiling for
Tired of hanging on
If you've miss me, I've just gone
'Cause they're taking me
Out of my mind

[Verse 1]
All of a sudden she was on my mind
I wasn't ready for her kind
And she was taking her time

[Chorus]
Oh, if she came to me
Would she be kind?
And if she stayed with me
Do you think that she'd like to do
Anything I would
Or would she leave me?

[Verse 2]
Lately I've found myself losing my mind
Knowing how badly I need her
It's something hard to find

[Chorus]
Oh, if she came to me
Would she be kind?
And if she stayed with me
Do you think that she'd like to do
Anything I would
Or would she leave me?

[Bridge]
If I could have her tonight
Doеs she want to go?
Look at those eyеs
Does she want to?
If I could have her tonight
If I could have her tonight
If I could have her tonight

[Verse 1]
When the dream came
I held my breath with my eyes closed
I went insane like a smoke ring day when the wind blows
Now, I won't be back till later on
If I do come back at all
But you know me, and I miss you now

[Verse 2]
In a strange game
I saw myself as you knew me
When the change came and you had a chance to see through me
Though the other side is just the same
You can tell my dream is real
Because I love you, can you see me now?

[Outro]
Though we rush ahead to save our time
We are only what we feel
And I love you, can you feel it now?
Can you feel it now?

[Verse 1]
Oh, hello Mr. Soul, I dropped by to pick up a reason
For the thought that I caught that my head is the event of the season
Why in crowds just a trace of my face could seem so pleasin'
I'll cop out to the change but a stranger is putting the tease on

[Verse 2]
I was down on a frown when the messenger brought me a letter
I was raised by the praise of a fan who said I upset her
Any girl in the world could have easily known me better
She said, "You're strange but don't change" and I let her

[Verse 3]
In a while will the smile on my face turn to plaster?
Stick around while the clown who is sick does the trick of disaster
For the race of my head and my face is moving much faster
Is it strange I should change? I don't know, why don't you ask her?

[Outro]
Is it strange I should change, I don't know, why don't you ask her?
Stick around while the clown who is sick does the trick of disaster

[Verse 1]
There you stood on the edge of your feather
Expecting to fly
While I laughed, I wondered whether
I could wave goodbye
Knowing that you'd gone?

[Bridge 1]
By the summer, it was healing
We had said goodbye
All the years we'd spent with feeling
Ended with a cry
Babe, ended with a cry

[Verse 2]
I tried so hard to stand
As I stumbled and fell to the ground
So hard to laugh as I fumbled
And reached for the love I'd found
Knowing it was gone

[Bridge 2]
If I ever said I lovеd you
Now you know I tried
If I ever said  livеd without you
Now you know I died
Babe, now you know I died
Babe, now you know I died

[Verse 1]
Well, I used to drive a cab you know
I heard a siren scream
Pulled over to the corner and I fell into a dream
There were two men eating pennies
And three young girls who cried
The West coast is falling, I see rocks in the sky
The preacher took his Bible and laid it on the stool
He said "With the congregation running
Why should I play the fool?"

[Verse 2]
Well, I used to be a woman you know
I took you for a ride
I let you fly my airplane
It looked good for your pride
'Cause you're the kind of man you know
Who likes what he says
I wonder what's it's like to be so far over my head
The lady made the wedding
And she brought along the ring
She got down on her knees and said
"Let's get on with this thing"

[Verse 3]
Well, I used to be a folk singer
Keeping managers alive
When you saw me on a corner
And told me I was jive
So I unlocked your mind, you know
To see what I could see
If you guarantee the postage
I'll mail you back the key
Well I woke up in the morning
With an arrow through my nose
There was an Indian in the corner
Trying on my clothes

[Verse 4]
Well, I used to be asleep you know
With blankets on my bed
I stayed there for a while till they discovered I was dead
The coroner was friendly, and I liked him quite a lot
If I hadn't have been a woman
I guess I'd never have been caught
They called up all my friends and told them
They had been misled
They gave me back my house and car
And nothing more was said

[Verse 5]
I was driving down the freeway
When my car ran out of gas
Pulled over to the station but I was afraid to ask
The servicemen were yellow and the gasoline was green
Although I knew I couldn't
I thought that I was gonna scream
That was on my last trip to Tulsa
Just before the snow
If you ever need a ride there
Be sure to let me know

[Verse 6]
I was chopping down a palm tree
When a friend dropped by to ask
If I would feel less lonely
If he helped me swing the axe
I said, "No, it's not a case of being lonely we have here
I've been working on this palm tree
For eighty seven years"
I said, "No, it's not a case of being lonely we have here
I've been working on this palm tree
For eighty seven years"
He said, "Go get lost!" and walked toward his Cadillac
I chopped down the palm tree
And it landed on his back

[Verse 1]
He's a perfect stranger
Like a cross of himself and a fox
He's a feeling arranger
And a changer of the ways he talks
He's the unforeseen danger
The keeper of the key to the locks

[Chorus]
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner

[Verse 2]
If you see him in the subway
He'll be down at the end of the car
Watching you move
Until he knows, he knows who you are
When you get off at your station alone
He'll know that you are

[Chorus]
Know whеn you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open widе
It's the loner

[Verse 3]
There was a woman he knew
About a year or so ago
She had something that he needed
And he pleaded with her not to go
On the day that she left
He died but it did not show

[Chorus]
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner

[Verse 1]
Lover, there will be another one
Who'll hover over you beneath the sun
Tomorrow, see the things that never come today

[Chorus]
When you see me fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over, it's over

[Verse 2]
Nestled in your wings, my little one
Is special, morning brings another sun
Tomorrow, see the things that never come today

[Chorus]
When you see me fly away without you
Shadow on the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over, it's over

[Chorus]
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 1]
It's so noisy at the fair
But all your friends are there
And the candy floss you had
And your mother and your dad

[Chorus]
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 2]
There's a girl just down the aisle
Oh to turn and see her smilе
You can hear the words she wrotе
As you read a hidden note

[Chorus]
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 3]
Now you're underneath the stairs
And you're giving back some glares
To the people that you met
And it's your first cigarette

[Chorus]
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 4]
Now you say you're leaving home
'Cause you want to be alone
Ain't it funny how you feel
When you're findin' out it's real, real?

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 1]
I've been looking for a woman to save my life
Not to beg or to borrow
A woman with the feeling of losing once or twice
Who knows how it could it be tomorrow?

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
Such a long time now
Such a long time now
Such a long time now

[Verse 1]
Don't call pretty Peggy, she can't hear you no more
Don't leave no message around her back door
They say the old laughing lady been here before
She don't keep time, she don't count score

[Verse 2]
You can't have a cupboard if there ain't no wall
You got to move, there's no time left to stall
They say the old laughing lady dropped by to call
When she leaves, she leaves nothing at all

[Verse 3]
See the drunkard of the village falling on the street
Can't tell his ankles from the rest of his feet
He loves his old laughing lady 'cause her taste is so sweet
But his laughing lady's loving ain't the kind he can keep

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
There's a fever on the freeway, blacks out the night
There's a slippin' on the stairway just don't feel right
And there's a rumbling in the bedroom and a flashing of light
There's the old laughing lady, everything is all right

[Verse 1]
The lights turned on and the curtain fell down
And when it was over, it felt like a dream
They stood at the stage door and begged for a scream
The agents had paid for the black limousine
That waited outside in the rain
Did you see them? Did you see them?

[Chorus]
Did you see them in the river?
They were there to wave to you
Could you tell that the empty-quivered
Brown-skinned Indian on the banks
That were crowded and narrow
Held a broken arrow?

[Verse 2]
Eighteen years of American dream
He saw that his brother had sworn on the wall
He hung up his eyelids and ran down the hall
His mother had told him a trip was a fall
And don't mention babies at all
Did you see him? Did you see him?

[Chorus]
Did you see him in the river?
He was there to wave to you
Could you tell that the empty-quivered
Brown-skinned Indian on the banks
That were crowded and narrow
Held a broken arrow?

[Verse 3]
The streets were lined for the wedding parade
The queen wore the white gloves, the county of song
The black-covered caisson her horses had drawn
Protected her king from the sun rays of dawn
They married for peace and were gone
Did you see them? Did you see them?

[Chorus]
Did you see them in the river?
They were there to wave to you
Could you tell that the empty-quivered
Brown-skinned Indian on the banks
That were crowded and narrow
Held a broken arrow?

[Intro: Jenn Em]
'Round winter time, when it gets cold
Everywhere else but the very best coast
I'm not gonna lie, it's kinda old
Hearing everybody sayin' 'bout all the snow
But I know
Oh, baby, Christmas to me ain't white, it's green

[Verse: Snoop Dogg]
Kids got a Christmas tree, daddy got a tree too
Keep some trees on me everytime I see you
Light up for the holidays, that's the shit that we do
The people made they voice heard, Cali made it legal
Now I'm droppin' off gifts, smokin' in the Rico
Old-school Christmas so greet it with some seasonin'
Chillin' in the seat I'm in, couple placеs so full
Them back to the trees again
Kush in the room
Now thе purple hit the circle
Gorilla glue in the mess
Take your time, don't let it hurt you
Sippin' on Act now
Watchin' my grandbaby
Bought her some headphones
Blowin' so fast, crazy how time flies
Look at granddaddy with them sight eyes

[Chorus: Jenn Em & Snoop Dogg]
Baby, Christmas to me ain't white, it's green
Green, green, green Christmas
And it's so easy to see it's gonna be
Another green Christmas for me, for me
Da-da-da-da-da-da, for me, for me
Da-da-da-da-da-da, for me, for me
Gonna be, for me, for me
Another green Christmas

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Jingle Bells, my weed smells
Like I'm gettin' paid (Like I'm gettin' paid)
Smokin' real up on the hill
Nothin' but top great, oh
I don't need no sock (I don't need no sock)
But I got this green all day (But I got this green all day)
Headed to the studio (Headed to the studio)
Smokin' all the way (Smokin' all the way)
I don't believe in fortune tellers
I wouldn't put a penny in a wishing well
I know what Santa Claus is all about
Glad I never seen him
You stepped out of a dream, captured my heart
Opened my arms and gave me a new start
There's love (there is love)
I've been sayings there's love (there is love love love)
Oh there's love (there is love)
I've been saying there's love (there is love love love)
Stranger my heart
I never been a paid above
But the beauty of your old love
Has made the song of heart
Count all my lessons, from being brand new
I needed someone to love and I was blessed from you
There's love (there is love)
I've been sayings there's love (there is love love love)
Oh there's love (there is love)
I can feel it there's love (there is love love love)
I'm counting all my blessings from being brand new
I needed someone to love and I was blessed from you
There's love (there is love)
I know love (there is love love love)
So glad that love (there is love)
Oh there's love (there is love love love)
I didn′t know that you love me like you do
I didn't know that you cared like you do
I didn′t know that your love was so strong
To keep me warm
I didn't know
I didn't know that you feel like you do
When you feel like you feel
Makes a man want to steal from you
I didn′t know people were talking about
The way you hold my hand
If feeling good is what it′s all about
Won't you try to understand?
For all that cry that don′t know no love
I don't know no one whole
I′ll think you'll understand
It′s love that makes a man
So we're back to grains of time
Grains of sand
I didn't know that you loved me
You should have told me
You should have explained to me
I didn′t know you love me like you do
So much like you do makes me
Talk in my sleep and things
I didn′t know that you
I didn't know that you want to hold me
Likе you do
The way you talk to me
When you′rе talking to me
I didn't know you love me like you do
My my, I keep on...
The way you′re saying something to me
I didn't know
Nobody told me, nobody explained to me
Nobody said anything to me
Nobody called on the telephone
And I just get that feeling way down
I didn′t know that you love me
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
I didn't know, I didn't know
I didn′t know you love me like you do
It makes me, makes me wanna...
You should have told me
Somebody, won′t you help me?
Smooth talking, easy walking
Sweet little woman like you, yeah
Somebody better do something for me
I didn't know that you needed me
Should have called
Should have explained
Said
Should have said
The time has come for closing books
And long last looks must end, yeah
And as I leave
I know that I am leaving my best friend

A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong that's a lot to learn
What, what can I give you in return?

If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
To sir with love

Those schooldays are
Of telling tales, biting nails are gone, oh
But in my mind
I know that they live on and on, on and on and on

But how do you thank someone
Who had been so good to you?
Well, it's not easy, oh but I'll try
If you wanted the sky
I would write across the sky in lettеrs
That would soar a thousand feet high
To sir with love

The time has comе for closing books
And long last looks must end, oh, oh
And as I leave, yeah
I know that I am leaving my best friend, oh, oh

A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong that's a lot to learn
What, what can I give you in return?

If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart
Oh sir, with love, yeah, yeah, yeah
Stumbling morning gracefully
Bright sunshine makes me believe
That it is God that keeps me alive
Though I work from day to day
Found I just can't make a way
Without the Lord can't go on
What's the matter with your mind
You have mind and you are blind
Praying is the way to him
Without him you'll never win
Don't you feel your spirit move
Tell me you're controlling you
I'd be wrong not to say
It's true life's the only way
King of all
You made all of us
King of all
You're the reasons why
King of all
You mean so much
King of all
You're the reasons why
Children playing gladly
Know how happy we could be
To give your life back to the king
He who give you everything
Lay your burden right on down
Feel the place go wound and wound
Let the hooky spirit in
We are the children of the king
King of all the power
King of all
Don't you know he will be there when I smile
King of all. (repeated at the end)
Happy days are here again
Found yourself and your friend
I found the way baby
I found the way again

Happy days are here
Happy days are near
Never shed a tear
Happy days are here
Let′s dance around

Only if I tried again
Sing a song without an end
Keep looking up
Happy days are here

Happy days are here
Happy days are here
Happy days are here
And I have to share them
Happy days are near
Never havе to shed a tear
Happy days are hеre
Happy days are near
Happy days are here
Happy days are near

Happy days are here
Happy days are near
Happy days are here
Happy days are near...
You know and I know
I love you in a special way
And when you call me
I met you first to be my friend
Life without your love is no good at all
So I'm glad you're here to hear my call
With you by my side I'll never fall
At all, at all
You say I never pay
No attention to the things you say
And I can't understand
Why you answer every time I pray?
Cause without your love
So what can I say?
Need you more and more everyday
Talk to you and I try to explain
Explain it all
You know and I know
All about you everything you say
And without you nothing comes my way
I can't live without you not a single day
You know and I know
Your every smile
Your every frown
I try to do my best
But it's not good enough
And I'm back on the ground
Sometimes I think about my faults
I think about giving up but then
I can't think that at all cause
I can't live without your love not a single day
At all
You know and I know
I love you, I love you
You know and I know
I love you, I love you
Soul Survivor (spoken)

To be a soul survivor
Heading for the place
That he promised to me
A soul survivor
And everlasting love for eternity
I never doubt for a minute
The power of the word
Or the messages in it
But Jesus had to live everyday
In a blessed righteous way
So I'm taking out a policy
Gonna get some soul insurance
Jesus is my benefactor
Leaving my spiritual state
To the one I pledge my fate
To bе a soul survivor
Heading for the place
That hе promised to me
A soul survivor
And everlasting love for eternity
To be a soul survivor
Heading for the place
That he promised to me
A soul survivor
And everlasting love for eternity
Worldly wants won’t permit it
Only suffering from a life of sin
Why don't you let go and let God?
Give you what you're searching for
He’d give you all the love
You've been missing
Save you from disaster
Just open up your heart
And let him in today
Cause it's your soul that he's after
To be a soul survivor
Heading for the place
That he promised to me
A soul survivor
And everlasting love for eternity
To be a soul survivor
Heading for the place
That he promised to me
A soul survivor
And everlasting love for eternity
In my Father's house there are many men
Every one a soul I've been told
I'm going away to prepare a place for you
And where I am there ye maybe also
To be a soul survivor
Heading for the place
That he promised to me
A soul survivor
And everlasting love for eternity
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on

Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
His truth is marching on

I have seen him in the watch fires of a hundred circling camps
They have builded him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
I can read his righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps;
His day is marching on

Glory, glory, hallеlujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
His truth is marching on

He has soundеd forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment seat;
O be swift, my soul, to answer him; be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
His truth is marching on

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea
With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me;
As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men free
While our God is marching on

Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
His truth is marching on

He is coming like the glory of the morning on the wave
He is wisdom to the mighty, he is honor to the brave;
So the world shall be his footstool, and the soul of wrong his slave
Our God is marching on

Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
His truth is marching on
People get ready
There's a train coming
Don't need no ticket
You can just step on board
All you need is a little faith
To hear diesels humming
We ain't got a handle baggage out
We can just thank the Lord

People get ready there's a train to Jordan
No need, no ticket, just step on board
All you need is faith to hear diesels humming
No need a ticket, just thank the Lord

Thank the Lord, thank the Lord
Thank the Lord, thank the Lord
Thank the Lord, thank the Lord
Thank the Lord, thank the Lord

You got to get ride in now
The train is coming
You don't need no ticket
You can just step on board
But all you need is a little faith
You can hear diesels humming
You ain't even got to have no bags
You can just get on board
People get ready there's a train to Jordan
There's a train coming, get on board
All you need is faith to hear diesels humming
You don't need no tickets, you just thank the Lord

Thank the Lord, thank the Lord
Thank the Lord, thank the Lord
Thank the Lord, thank the Lord
Thank the Lord, thank the Lord

Thank the Lord, thank the Lord
Thank the Lord, thank the Lord
Thank the Lord, thank the Lord
Thank the Lord, thank the Lord
Lyrics from Snippets

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Don't gotta say it 'cause we know, yeah
She must be a damn cold, baby
'Cause I swear she say she know us (Yeah)
I'm so good at playin' this game, my god damn, she calls, yeah
I got handful of a bad 'lil shawties, call this a free show, yeah
And she don't know, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
I need someone to be here for me
Why the fake love want some from me?
Know a whole lotta bitches that'll snake on me
For some reason I got fake, oh, yeah
Maybe this'll just fade or something
Everybody is afraid of something
Maybe baby...

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Don't gotta say it 'cause we know, yeah
She must be a damn cold, baby
'Cause I swear she say she know us (Yeah)
I'm so good at playin' this game, God damn, she calls, yeah
I got handful of a bad 'lil shawties, call this a free show, yeah
And she don't know, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Oh, hello Mr. Soul, I dropped by to pick up a reason
For the thought that I caught that my head is the event of the season
Why in crowds just a trace of my face could seem so pleasin'
I'll cop out to the change but a stranger is putting the tease on

[Verse 2]
I was down on a frown when the messenger brought me a letter
I was raised by the praise by the fan who said I upset her
Any girl in the world could have easily known me better
She said, "You're strange but don't change" and I let her

[Verse 3]
In a while will the smile on my face turn to plaster?
Stick around while the clown who is sick does the trick of disaster
For the race of my head and my face is moving much faster
Is it strange I should change? I don't know, why don't you ask her?

[Outro]
Is it strange I should change, I don't know, why don't you ask?
Is it strange I should change, I don't know

[Verse 1]
Oh, hello Mr. Soul, I dropped by to pick up a reason
For the thought that I caught that my head is the event of the season

[Verse 3]

[Outro]
Is it strange I should change? I don't know
Is it strange I should change? I don't know

[Verse 1]
I went to the movie the other night
The plot was groovy, it was out of sight
I sat with my popcorn, out lookin' for good times
Lost in the cartoon, I grabbed the lifeline

[Verse 2]
I've been a searcher, I've been a fool
But I've been a long time comin' to you
Hopin' that your love can carry me through
You're holdin' my baby and I'm holdin' you

[Guitar and Piano Solos]

[Verse 3]
Oh, tell me where the answer lies
Is it in the notebook behind your eyes?
When your decision comes to view
I'll be watchin' my TV and it'll be watchin' you

[Piano Solo]
Alright Nils

[Guitar and Piano Solos]

[Verse 3]
Oh, tell me wherе the answer lies
Is it in thе notebook behind your eyes?
When your decision comes to view
I'll be watchin' my TV and it'll be watchin' you

[Outro]
Speakin' out

[Verse 1]
Well, they say that Santa Fe
Is less than ninety miles away
And I got time to roll a number and rent a car
Oh, Albuquerque

[Verse 2]
I've been flyin' down the road
And I've been starvin' to be alone
Independent from the scene that I've known
Oh, Albuquerque

[Harmonica & Pedal Steel Guitar Solos]

[Verse 3]
So I'll stop when I can
Find some fried eggs and country ham
I'll find somewhere where they don't care who I am
Oh, Albuquerque
Oh, Albuquerque

[Chorus]
New mama's got a son in her eyes
No clouds are in my changing skies
Each mornin' when I wake up to rise
I'm livin' in a dreamland

[Verse]
Changing times, ancient reasons
That turn to lies
Throw them all away
Head in hand
Gift of wonders to understand
And open all the way

[Chorus]
New mama's got a son in her eyes
No clouds are in my changing skies
Each morning when I wake up to rise
I'm livin' in a dreamland

Fourteen junkies, too weak to work
One sells diamonds for what they're worth
Down on pain street, disappointment lurks
Son, don't be home too late

Try to get back by eight
Son, don't wait till the break of day
'Cause you know how time fades away
Time fades away
You know how time fades away

All day presidents look out windows
All night sentries watch the moonglow
All are waiting till the time is right
Son, don't be home too late

Try to get back by eight
Son, don't wait till the break of day
'Cause you know how time fades away
Time fades away
You know how time fades away
Back in Canada I spent my days
Riding subways through a haze
I was handcuffed, I was born and raised
Son, don't be home too late

Try to get back by eight
Son, don't wait till the break of day
'Cause you know how time fades away
Time fades away
You know how time fades away

Thirteen junkies, too weak to work
One sells diamonds for what they're worth
Down on pain street disappointment lurks
Son, don't be home too late

Try to get back by eight, eight
Son, don't wait till the break of day
'Cause you know how time fades away
Time fades away
You know how time fades away

Time fades away
You know how time fades away
I'm speakin' out

I went to the movies the other night
The plot was groovy, it was out of sight
I sat with my popcorn, out lookin' for good times
Lost in the cartoon, I grabbed the lifeline

Well I've been a searcher, I've been a fool

[Verse 1]
If you're lookin' for me
You'll find me resting in the shade
Of the mountains and trees
Beneath the cool summer breeze
And I don't mind if you stay
'Cause everybody's alone
Everybody's alone

[Verse 2]
People talkin' to me
Someone saying that I'm not the same
That's not so easy to be
But when I'll learn to be free
I wonder if I'll miss the pain
'Cause everybody's alone
Everybody's alone

[Bridge]
All I want you to know
Is that I love you so much
I can hardly stand it
But everybody's alone
Evеrybody's alone

[Outro]
Everybody's alone
Evеrybody's alone

[Intro]
He was sitting in the lounge of the Empire Hotel
Drinking for diversion and thinking for himself
A little money riding on the Maple Leafs
Along comes a lady in lacy sleeves

[Verse 1]
She says "Let me sit down, you know, drinkin' alone's a shame
Look at those jokers glued to that damn hockey game
Hey honey, you've got lots of cash
Bring us 'round a bottle and we'll have some laughs
Gin's what I'm drinking, I was raised on robbery"

[Verse 2]
I'm a pretty good cook, I'm sitting on my groceries
Come up to my kitchen, I'll show you my best recipe
I try and I try but I can't savе a cent
I'm up after midnight cooking, trying to make my rеnt
I'm rough but I'm pleasin', I was raised on robbery

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
We had a little money once
They were pushing through a four lane highway
Government gave us three thousand dollars
Lord, you should have seen it fly away
First he bought a '57 Biscayne, he put it in the ditch
He drunk up all the rest, that son of a bitch
His blood's bad whiskey, I was raised on robbery

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
You know you ain't bad looking, I like the way you hold your drinks
Come home with me honey, I ain't asking for no full length mink
Hey, where you going? Don't go yet
Your glass ain't empty and we just met
You're mean when you're loaded, I was raised on robbery

[Chorus]
New mama's got a sun in her eyes
No clouds are in my changing skies
Each morning when I wake up to rise
I'm livin' in a dreamland

[Verse]
Changing times, ancient reasons that turn to lies
Throw them all away head in hand
Gift of wonders to understand
And open all the way

[Chorus]
New mama's got a sun in her eyes
No clouds are in my changing skies
Each morning when I wake up to rise
I'm livin' in a dreamland

[Outro]
Oh new mama, oh new mama
Oh new mama, oh new mama
Oh new mama, oh new mama
Oh new mama, oh new mama

[Verse 1]
It's too dark to put the keys in my ignition
And the morning sun is yet to climb my hood ornament
But before too long I might see those flashing message lights
Look out, mama, 'cause I'm comin' home tonight

[Chorus]
Think I'll roll another number for the road
I feel able to get under any load
Though my feet aren't on the ground
I been standing on this sound
Of some open hearted people goin' down

[Pedal Steel Guitar and Piano Solos]

[Verse 2]
I'm not going back to Woodstock for a while
Though I long to hear that lonesome hippie smile
I'm a million miles away from that helicopter day
No, I don't believe I'll be going back that way

[Chorus]
Think I'll roll another number for the road
I feel able to get under any load
Though my feet aren't on the ground
I been standin' on this sound
Of some open hearted people goin' down

[Pedal Steel Guitar and Piano Solos]
Everybody sing along, c'mon

[Chorus]
Think I'll roll another number for the road
I feel able to get under any load yes I do
Though my feet aren't on the ground
I been standin' on this sound
Of some open hearted people goin' down

[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, whoa
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night

[Verse 1]
Bruce Berry was a working man
He used to load that Econoline van
A sparkle was in his eye
But his life was in his hands
People let me tell you
Late at night when the people were gone
He used to pick up my guitar
And sing a song in a shaky voice
That was real as the day is long

[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight

[Verse 2]
Early in the mornin' at the break of day
Hе used to sleep until the afternoon
If you nеver heard him sing
I guess you won't too soon
People let me tell you
It sent a chill up and down my spine
When I picked up the telephone
And heard that he died out on the mainline

[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night

[Verse 1]
Bruce Berry was a working man
He used to load that Econoline van
A sparkle was in his eye
But his life was in his hand
Late at night when the people were gone
He used to pick up my guitar
And sing a song in a shaky voice
That was real as the day is long

[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night (Sing along)
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, yes it is
Tonight's the night

Whoa

[Verse 1]
Baby mellow my mind
Make me feel like a schoolboy on good time
Juggling nickels and dimes
Satisfied with a fish on the line

[Bridge]
I've been down the road and I've come back
Lonesome whistle on the railroad track
Ain't got nothing on those feelings that I had

[Verse 2]
Something so hard to find
A situation that can casualize your mind

[Bridge]
I've been down the road and I've come back
Lonesome whistle on the railroad track
Ain't got nothing on those feelings that I had

[Verse 1]
Baby mellow my mind
Make me feel like a schoolboy on good time
Juggling nickels and dimes
Satisfied with the fish on the line

[Verse 1]
You know I lose, you know I win
You know I call for the shape I'm in
It's just a game you see me play
Only real in the way
That I feel from day to day

[Verse 2]
Although the answer is not unknown
I'm searchin', searchin', and how I've grown
It's not all right to say goodbye
And the world on a string
Doesn't mean a thing

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
No, the world on a string
Doesn't mean a thing
It's only real in the way
That I feel from day to day
No, the world on a string
Doesn't mean a thing
It's only real in the way
That I feel from day to day
No, the world on a string
Doesn't mean a thing
It's only real

[Verse 1]
Pretty Maui Mama lying over the water
With my son in your eyes
Can you hear the melody I play?
It changes every day
Oh, Hawaiian sunrise

[Verse 2]
Once when we were there we had relaxing times
Thought we might settle down
But the music called me and my friends
Have much to spread around
We moved from town to town
Hawaiian sunrise

[Bridge]
Andin the morning when you rise
Will you look in my son's eyes?
I know you do

[Verse 3]
Pretty Maui Mama lying over thе water
With the moon in your eyеs
From my airplane window in the clouds
I love you right out loud
Oh, Hawaiian sunrise

[Bridge]
And in the morning when you rise
Will you look in my son's eyes?
I know you do

[Verse 1]
Well he shot four men in a cocaine deal
And he left them lyin' in an open field
Full of old cars with bullet holes in the mirrors
He tried to do his best but he could not

[Chorus]
Please take my advice, please take my advice
Please take my advice
Open up the tired eyes
Open up the tired eyes

[Verse 2]
Well, it wasn't supposed to go down that way
But they burnеd his brother, you know
And they left him lyin' in thе driveway
They let him down and they left him with nothin'
Even though he tried to do his best but he could not

[Chorus]
Well please take my advice, please take my advice, please take my advice
Please take my advice
Open up the tired eyes
Open up the tired eyes

[Verse 3]
Well tell me more, tell me more, tell me more, tell me more
I'd like to hear more
Can you tell me more?
Tell me more, tell me more
Tell me more
I mean, was he a heavy doper or was he just a loser?
I mean he was a friend of yours
He was a friend of yours
What do you mean, he had bullet holes in his mirrors?
He tried to do his best but he could not

[Chorus]
Please take my advice, please take my advice, please take my advice
Please take my advice
Open up the tired eyes
Open up the tired eyes

[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night

[Verse 1]
Bruce Berry was a workin' man
He used to load that Econoline van
A sparkle was in his eye
But his life was in his hands
Late at night when the people were gone
He used to pick up my guitar
And sing a song in a shaky voice
That was real as the day was long

[Choru]
Tonight's the night, yes it is
Tonight's the night, yes it is, yes it is
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night

[Verse 2]
Early in the mornin' at the break of day
He used to sleep until the afternoon
If you never heard him sing
I guess you won't too soon
'Cause people let me tell you
It sent a chill up and down my spine
When I picked up the telephone
And heard that he'd died out on the mainline

[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night, whoa
Tonight's the night

[Verse 3]
Bruce Berry was a working man
He used to load that Econoline van
Early in the morning just about the break of day
He used to sleep until the afternoon

[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night (Tonight's the night)
Tonight's the night (Tonight's the night)
Tonight's the night (Tonight's the night)
Tonight's the night (Tonight's the night)
Tonight's the night
Whoa

[Verse 1]
I hear some people been talkin' me down
Bring up my name, pass it 'round
They don't mention the happy times
They do their thing, I'll do mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh baby, that's hard to change
I can't tell them how to feel
Some get stoned, some get strange
But sooner or later it all gets real

[Chorus]
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on

[Verse 2]
I remember the good old days
Stayed up all night gettin' crazed
Then the money was not so good
But we still did the best we could

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh baby, that's hard to change
I can't tell them how to feel
Some get stoned, some get strange
But sooner or later it all gets real

[Chorus]
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on, walk on, walk on

[Verse 1]
We used to be so calm
Now I think of you all night long
'Cause you've been with another man
There you are and here I am

[Verse 2]
And I know we should be free
But freedom's a prison to me
'Cause I lied to keep it kind
When I left you far behind
And love became removed
As I wrote that guilty note
And it drove you far away

[Chorus]
L.A. girls and ocean boys
How did we come to share our joys
With L.A. girls and ocean boys

[Verse 3]
It's a special kind of love
That it takes to rise above
Like this love I have for you
And I still believe it's true
Yes, I still believe it's true
I still believe it's true

[Verse]
Believe me
When I tell you
That a love true
Isn't hard to find
'Cause I found mine
And she's so fine
Like a lifeline
From across the sea

[Bridge]
None of the neighbors remember names
They only see the faces
With destinations still unnamed
It's hard to leave the traces
For someone to follow

[Outro]
It's hard to leave traces
For someone to follow
Believe me
Alas my love I do you wrong
By treating me discourteously
But I have loved you oh so long
Delighting in your company

Greensleeves was all my joy
Greensleeves was my desire
Greensleeves was my heart of gold
And blue but my lady Greensleeves

Greensleeves were all she wore
As they stood beneath the ocean's roar
Greensleeves was my desire
Who but my lady Greensleeves

[Verse 1]
When anger has closed the door
My eyes go blind and I can only see behind
And I drown myself some more
Cool water is what I need
And time and space to help me understand
But it's alright
Who could live inside this frozen man?

[Verse 2]
I traveled to Amsterdam
Got a good hotel and money in my hand
Who could ask for more
Still I can't escape myself
I gather dust like an old book on a shelf
But that's alright
Who could live inside this frozen man?

[Verse 3]
I'm writing a letter home
I hope you don't mind if I travel on alone
I don't even know if shе's there
I dream of hеr body fine
And how it feels resting next to mine
But that's alright
Who could live inside this frozen man?
I can't get outside this frozen man
Help me get outside this frozen man

[Intro - Bridge]
My songs are all so long
And my words are all so sad
Why must I choose
Between the best things I ever had?

[Verse 1]
I've got the love/art blues
Don't know which one to choose
There's really something to lose
With these love/art blues

[Verse 2]
I went and played too hard
And I lost my fun
Oh, these love/art blues
Leave me a heavy one

[Bridge]
My songs are all so long
And my words are all so sad
Why must I choose
Between the best things I ever had?

[Harmonica Break]

[Verse 3]
I spilled my promise cup
I really don't know why
Now the distance lies
Between you and I

[Verse 1]
I've got the love art blues
Don't know which one to choose
There's really something to lose
With these love art blues

[Outro]
I went and played too hard

[Verse 1]
Still glaring from the city lights
Into paradise I soared
Unable to come down
For reasons I'd ignored
Total confusion, disillusion
New things I'm knowing
Ah ah ah ah ah

[Verse 2]
I'm standing on the shoreline
It's so fine out there
Leaving with the wind blowing
But love takes care
Wind blowing, ways of showing
New things I'm knowing
Ah ah ah ah ah

[Verse 3]
Wind blowing through my sails
It feels like I'm gone
Know me, know me
Show me, show me
New things I'm knowin'

[Verse 1]
It's a fallen situation
When all eyes are turned in
And the love isn't flowing
The way it could have been

[Chorus]
You brought it all on
Oh, but it feels so wrong
No, no, no I don't believe this song

[Verse 2]
It's a sad communication
With little reason to believe
When one isn't giving
And one pretends to receive

[Chorus]
You brought it all on
Oh, but it feels so wrong
No, no, no, no, I don't believe this song

[Verse 3]
Pardon my heart
If I showed that I cared
But I love you more than moments
We have or have not shared

[Chorus]
Oh, and it feels so good
When love flows the way that it should

[Outro]
It feels so good
It feels good
It feels good
One, two, three...

[Verse 1]
Once I was in love
Now it seems that time is better spent
Searching than in finding
But no one seems to know

[Verse 2]
Now I'm not so sure
What I'm looking for or what I want
And everywhere I go
No one seems to know

[Bridge]
When you're down you gather strength
To leave the ground
When you're high it makes you weak
And you fall back down

[Verse 3]
Oh, it's hardly real
The way it changes time and feel
And everywhere I go
No one seems to know

[Verse 1]
Once I was in love
Now it seems that time is better spent
Searching than in finding
And no one seems to know

[Verse 1]
I am a child, I last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile
You hold my hand, rough up my hair
It's lots of fun to have you there

[Chorus]
I gave to you, now, you give to me
I'd like to know what you've learned
The sky is blue and so is the sea
What is the color, when black is burned?
What is the color?

[Verse 2]
You are a man, you understand
You pick me up and you lay me down again
You make the rules, you say what's fair
It's lots of fun to have you there

[Chorus]
I gave to you, now, you give to me
I'd like to know what you learned
The sky is bluе and so is the sea
What is the color, whеn black is burned?
What is the color?

[Outro]
I am a child, I last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile

[Verse 1]
Baby mellow my mind
Make me feel like a schoolboy on good time
Jugglin' nickels and dimes
Satisfied with a fish on the line

[Bridge]
I've been down the road and I've come back
Lonesome whistle on the railroad track
Ain't got nothing on those feelings that I had

[Verse 2]
Something so hard to find
A situation that can casualize your mind

[Harmonica Break]

[Verse 1]
Baby mellow my mind
Make me feel like a schoolboy on good time
Jugglin' nickels and dimes
Satisfied with a fish on the line
Mediterranean
If I could meet you there
Who would ever care
We'd get in right on time
Right on time
Right on time

I dreamed my dream and I
Were walking in the rain
The sudden spirit came
And bid us take our leave
To holiday from fame
Vacation dream

Mediterranean
If I could meet you there
Who would ever care
We'd get in right on time
Right on time

[Verse 1]
It's midnight on the bay
And lights are shinin'
And the sailboats sway
And that cool ocean breeze
Blowin' down through the keys
I think I'll call it a day

[Refrain]
Oh, midnight on the bay
Sure feels good to me

[Verse 2]
What's this I see
There's someone comin'
Walkin' right up to me
She tells me I know your name
And if it's all the same
I'd like to spend some time
And midnight on the bay
Sure feels good to me

[Harmonica Solo]

[Refrain]
Oh, midnight on the bay
Sure feels good to me

[Verse 3]
And now it's midnight on the bay
Lights are shinin'
On the sailboats that sway
In the cool ocean breeze
Blowin' down through the Keys
I think I'll call it a day

[Refrain]
Oh, midnight on the bay
Sure feels good to me

[Outro]
Midnight, midnight, midnight, midnight, midnight on thе bay
Midnight, midnight, midnight, midnight, midnight on the bay
Midnight, midnight, midnight, midnight, midnight on the bay

[Verse 1]
In the jungle land
With the sea and the sand
Can I meet you there?
We'll be drinkin' bananas
From long tall glasses
In the open air

[Chorus]
Ocean girl
Come 'round the world
From forgotten shores

[Verse 2]
There'll be music playin'
What no words could say
When you first get there
We'll be lost in a corner
That we find in each other
There's so much to share

[Chorus]
Ocean girl
Come 'round the world
From forgotten shores

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Ocean girl, ocean girl
Ocean girl, ocean girl (Ocean girl)

Blowin' down through the Keys
I think I'll call it a day
Oh, midnight on the bay
Sure feels good to me

[Verse 2]
What's this I see
There's someone comin'
Walkin' right up to me
She tells me I know your name

Sure feels good to me

Oh, midnight on the bay
Sure feels good to me

[Outro]
Midnight, midnight, midnight, midnight, midnight
On the bay
Midnight, midnight, midnight, midnight

[Verse 1]
Who are you? Where are you going to?
What's your name? Why aren't you showing through?
I look in your eyes and I don't know what's there
You poison me with that long vacant stare
You talk like her and she walks in your words
You frown at me and then you smile at her

[Verse 2]
Are you my friend? Are you my enemy?
Can you pretend to live in harmony?
You come though in the weirdest way
You copy her in the things that you say
I need that girl like the night needs the day
I don't need you getting in my way

[Harmonica Break]

[Outro]
Vacancy, vacancy
Vacancy, vacancy
Who are you? Where are you going to?
Vacancy, vacancy
What's your name? Why aren't you showing through?

I got the love/art blues
Don't know which one to choose

I went and played too hard
And I lost my mind.,
Oh, these love art blues
Leave me a heavy one

My songs are all so long
And my words are all so sad
Why must I choose
Between the best things I ever had

I spilled my promise cup
I really don't know why
Now the distance lies
Between you and I

My songs are all so long
And my words arе all so sad
Why must I choose
Between the bеst things I ever had
I've got the love art blues
Don't know which one to choose
There's really something to lose
With these love art blues

I went and played too hard

[Verse 1]
Thirty-two teeth in a jawbone
Alabama's tryin' for none
Before I have to hit him
I hope he's got the sense to run
Reason the poor girls love him
Promise them everything
Why they all believe him?
He wears a big diamond ring

[Chorus]
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me
Just get down and leave and walk away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Majordomo Billy Bojangles
Sat down and had a drink with me
Said what about Alabama
That keeps a-coming back to me?
I heard your plea in the courthouse
Witness box began to rock and risе
Forty-nine sister states
Had Alabama in thеir eyes

[Chorus]
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me
Just get down and leave and walk away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Twenty-third Psalm Majordomo
Reserve me a table for three
Down in the Valley of the Shadow
Just you, Alabama and me
Major said why don't we give him
Rope enough to hang himself
No need to worry the jury
They'll probably take care of themselves

[Chorus]
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me
Just get down and leave and walk away
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me
Just get down and leave and walk away
Alabama getaway, getaway
Alabama getaway, getaway
Only way to please me
Just get down and leave and walk away

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Moses come riding up on a quasar
His spurs were jingling, the door was ajar
His buckle was silver, his manner was bold
I asked him to come on in out of the cold

[Pre-Chorus]
His brain was boiling, his reason was spent
If nothing is borrowed, nothing is lent
Asked me for mercy, I gave him a gun
Now and again, these things just got to be done

[Chorus]
Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence
You'd get right to work if you had any sense
You know the one thing we need is a left-hand monkey wrench

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Gideon come in with his eyes on the floor
Said, "You ain't got a hinge, you can't close the door"
Now, Moses stood up, a full six-foot-ten
And said, "You can't close the door when the wall's caved in"

[Pre-Chorus]
Asked him for water, he poured me some wine
We finished the bottle and broke into mine
You get what you come for, you're ready to go
And it's more than ten thousand that come for the show

[Chorus]
Abraham and Isaac diggin' on a well
Mama come quick with the water witch spell
Cool clear water well you can't ever tell

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence
You'd get right to work if you have any sense
You know the one thing we need is a left-hand monkey wrench

[Verse 1]
Merry run around, sailing up and down
Looking for a shove in some direction
Got it from the top, don't know when to stop
Don't you know they made a fine connection?

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Verse 2]
...
Nothing that you need to add or do
Don't get in their way, there's nothing you can say
Nothing that you need to add or do

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's nothing, they explain, it's like a diesel train
You better not be there when it rolls over
When that train pulls in, you won't know wherе it's been
Gotta try to see a little further

[Chorus]
They lovе each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Verse 1]
I have seen where the wolf has slept by the silver stream
I can tell by the mark he left you were in his dream
Ah, child of countless trees
Ah, child of boundless seas
What you are and what you're meant to be
Speaks his name, though you were born to me
Born to me, Cassidy

[Verse 2]
Lost now on the country miles in his Cadillac
I can tell by the way you smile he's rolling back
Come and wash the nighttime clean
Come and grow this scorched ground green
Blow the horn and tap the tambourine
Close the gap of the dark years in between
You and me, Cassidy

[Bridge]
Quick beats in an icy heart
A catch-colt draws a coffin cart
There he goes and now here she starts
Hear her cry
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine
Done with mine

[Instrumental Break]

Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
There was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell
He had a beautiful daughter, the truth to you I'll tell
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell
She had sweethearts a plenty, and men of high degree
But none but Jack the sailor, her true love ever could be
Oh, her true love ever could be
Now, Jackie's gone a sailing, with trouble on his mind
He's left his native country and his darling girl behind
Oh, his darling girl behind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She went down to a tailor shop and drеssed in man's array
She climbed on board a vеssel to convey herself away
Oh, convey herself away
Before you get on board, sir, your name we'd like to know
She smiled on her countenance, they call me Jack-a-roe
Oh, they call me Jack-a-roe
I see your waist is slender, your fingers they are small
Your cheeks too red and rosy to face the cannonball
Oh, to face the cannonball
I know my waist is slender, my fingers they are small
But it would not make me tremble to see ten thousand fall
Oh, to see ten thousand fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
The war soon being over, she went and looked around
Among the dead and wounded her darling boy she found
Oh, her darling boy she found
She picked him up on in her arms and carried him to the town
She sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds
Oh, to quickly heal his wounds
This couple they got married so well they did agree
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Oh, why not you and me?
Oh, why not you and me?

[Verse 1]
I'm a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for days
I'm a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for days
Keep everything in the barnyard, people, upset in every way

[Verse 2]
Dogs begin to bark now, and the hounds begin to howl
Dogs begin to bark now, and the hounds begin to howl
Watch out, stray cat people
The little red rooster's on the prowl, on the prowl

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
If you see a little red rooster, won't you please drive him home
If you see a little red rooster, please, please drivе him home
Been no peace in thе barnyard, people, since the little red rooster's been gone

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I'm a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for days
I'm a little red rooster, too lazy, lazy to crow for days
Keep everything in the barnyard, people, upset in every way

[Verse 1]
In the timbers of Fennario
The wolves are running 'round
The winter was so hard and cold
Froze ten feet 'neath the ground

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 2]
I sat down to my supper
It was a bottle of red whiskey
I said my prayers and went to bed
That's the last they saw of me

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 3]
When I awoke, the dire wolf
Six hundred pounds of sin
Was grinning at my window
All I said was, "Come on in"

[Chorus]
But don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 4]
The wolf came in, I got my cards
We sat down for a game
I cut my deck to the Queen of Spades
But the cards were all the same

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
In the backwash of Fennario
The black and bloody mire
The dire wolf collects his due
While the boys sing around the fire

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Outro]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 1]
I woke today, felt your side of the bed
The covers were still warm where you'd been layin'
You were gone, my heart was filled with dread
You might not be sleeping here again

[Chorus]
Well, it's alright, 'cause I love you
And that's not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs
Written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Verse 2]
Did you ever waken to the sound of street cats making lovе?
You'd guess from their cries you wеre listening to a fight
Well, you know, oh, hate's just the last thing they're thinking of
They're only tryin' to make it through the night

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I only wanna hold you, I don't wanna tie you down
Or fence you in the lines I might've drawn
It's just that I, I, I have gotten used to havin' you around
My landscape would be empty if you were gone

[Chorus]
Well, it's alright, 'cause I love you
And that's not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs
Written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Outro]
I believe it's gonna rain today
Keep it comin' now, here come the rain
Ooh, keep it comin' now, here come the rain, here come the rain
Ooh, keep it comin' now, here come the rain, here come the rain
Ooh, turnin' gray and it looks like rain
Here come the rain, here come the rain
Ooh, wish these clouds would go but here come the rain
Here come the rain

[Instrumental Break]

Well, it looks like rain and it feels like rain, Lord
Here come the rain
Well, it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh Lord
Here come the rain, here come the rain
Said it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh Lord
Here come the rain
Wish these clouds would go away
Well, it looks like rain and it feels like rain, whoa Lord
Here come the rain
Guess it's gonna rain today
Well, it looks like rain and it feels like rain, Lord
Whoa, here come the rain, here come the rain
It looks like rain and it feels like rain, whoa Lord
Here come the rain
Well now the whole world's turnin' gray
And it looks like rain and it feels like rain
Oh, here come the rain, here come the rain
It looks like rain and it feels like rain, Lord
Here come the rain

Here come the rain

[Verse 1]
My mama told me, my papa told me, too
My mama told me, papa told me, too
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues

Wish I had a-listened to what mama said
Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what mama said
And I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Well, my train's going down, she's rolling down the line

I went to the depot, never got there on time
Went down to the depot, never got there on time
Well, that train's going down, she's rolling down the line

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what mama said
Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed
My mama told me, my papa told me, too
Well, my mama told me, papa told me, too
Well, I shouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues

[Verse 1]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads, pass into the sea

[Pre-Chorus]
She comes from a town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
And she's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
She bears it away with a love that the river has taught her

[Chorus]
Let it flow, let it flow, wide and clear

[Verse 2]
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again

[Pre-Chorus]
The plowman is broad as the back of the land he's sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing

[Chorus]
Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of man
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall
Rise and fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
This must be heaven
Tonight I cross the line
You must be the angels
I thought I might never find
Was it you I heard singing
Oh, while I was chasing dreams?
Driven by the wind
Like the dust that blows around

[Chorus]
When the rain fallin' down now
I never know now
No, I never know, no, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
Got to be heaven
'Cause here's where the rainbow ends
And if this ain't the real thing
We're close enough to pretend, pretеnd
But when that wind blows
When the night's about to fall
I can hеar the sirens call
It's a certain sort of sound

[Chorus]
When the rain fallin' down now
Rain fallin' down
The rain' fallin' down

[Bridge]
Holes in what's left of my reason
Holes in the knees of my blues
Odds against me been increasin'
But I'll pull through, that's right

Never could read no road map
No, I don't know what the weather might do
Hear that witch wind whinin'
See that dog star shinin'
I've got a feelin' there's no time to lose
No time to lose

Never know, no, no
Never never know, no, no, no

[Verse 3]
Well, it's been heaven
But even rainbows will end
Now my sails are fillin'
And the wind is willin'
And I'm good as gone again
And I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance
The Saint of Circumstance
Just a tiger in a trance
In the rain fallin' down now

[Bridge]
Rain fallin' down now
Rain fallin' down now
Rain fallin' down
Rain fallin' down, the rain fallin' down

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Woo, well, I never know, no
Just don't know, I never know now
Listen, I sure don't know what I'm going for
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Never know, I never know)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
('Cause I got to, got to go)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Maybe going on a dream)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(Maybe going on a feeling)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Maybe never never never know, no)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(Got to, got to, got to, got to go)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(How about you now? You know?)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
('Cause what you got to do, hey)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(No, I never, never, never know)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(No, no, no, at the show, hey)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Maybe going on a dream now)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(Maybe going on a feeling, maybe going on a feeling)

[Scarlet Begonias]

[Verse 1]
As I was walking 'round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter
But a nip to the air
From the other direction
She was calling my eye
It could be an illusion
But I might as well try
Might as well try

[Verse 2]
Had rings on her fingers
And bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking
She was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias
Tucked into her curls
I knew right away
She was not like other girls
Other girls

[Verse 3]
In the heat of the evening
When the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open
And too cool to bluff
I picked up my matches
And was closing the door
I had one of those flashes
I'd been there before
Been there before

[Bridge]
I ain't often right
But I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way
It does in the song
Once in a while
You can get shown the light
In the strangest of places
If you look at it right

[Verse 4]
Ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues
And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eye
Had to learn the hard way to let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers
Just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing
In the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Instrumental]

[Fire on the Mountain]

[Verse 1]
Long distance runner, what you standin' there for?
Get up, get on, get out of the door
Playing cold music on the barroom floor
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core
Dragon with matches loose on the town
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Almost ablaze still you don't feel the heat
It takes all you got just to stay on the beat
You say it's a living, we all gotta eat
But you're here alone, there's no one to compete
If mercy's in business, I wish it for you
More than just ashes when your dreams come true

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Long distance runner, what you holding out for?
Caught in slow motion in a fall to the floor
You're playing cold and now spread to the floor
You gave all you had, why you wanna give more?
The more that you give, the more it will take
To the thin line beyond which you really can't fake
Well

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Outro]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain! (Well)
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, no no

[Verse 2]
I've been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you about all that went down
It would burn off both your ears

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, no no

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me
And tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sitting there
Composing lonesome blues

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, no no

[Verse 1 repeated]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down

[Outro]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down

[Instrumental Break]

Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down, no no

[Chorus]
I was born in a desert, I was raised in a lion's den
I was born in a desert, I was raised in a lion's den
Well, my number one occupation
Is stealing womens from their other men

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Well, the sheriff couldn't catch me
But his little girl sure wished she would
You know she wished she would

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well now, the doctor call me crazy, some says I am, some says I ain't
Say the doctor call mе crazy, some says I am, some says I ain't
You say the prеacher man call me a sinner, but his little girl call me a saint

[Verse 3]
Take a couple shots of whiskey, women around here start looking good
Take a couple shots of whiskey, Long Island girls start looking good
Take a couple more shots of whiskey, I'm going down to Minglewood
You know that means no good

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
T for Texas, yes, and it's T for Timbuktu
Tell you it's T for Texas, yes, and it's T for Timbuktu
You say it's T for New York City where the little girls know what to do

[Chorus]
I was born in a desert, I was raised in a lion's den
I was born in a desert, I was raised in a lion's den
Well, my number one occupation
Is stealing womens from their other men

[Outro]
And I'll do it, do it again
Hey now, my number one occupation
Is stealing womens from their other men

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
You told me goodbye, how was I to know
You didn't mean goodbye, you meant please don't let me go
I was having a high time, living the good life, well, you know

[Verse 2]
The wheels are muddy, got a ton of hay
Now listen up here, baby, 'cause I mean what I say
I'm having a hard time, living the good life, well, you know

[Bridge]
I was losing time, I had nothing to do
No one to fight, I came to you
Wheels broke down, the leader won't draw
The line is busted, the last one I saw

[Verse 3]
Tomorrow come trouble, tomorrow come pain
Now don't think too hard, baby, 'cause I know what I'm saying
I could show you a high time, living the good lifе, well, you know

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Nothing's for certain, it could always go wrong
Come on in whеn it's raining, go on out when it's gone
We could have us a high time, living the good life, well, you know

[Verse 1]
Compass card is spinning
Your elm is swingin' to and fro
Ooh, where's the dog star?
Ooh, where's the moon?

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been too long at sea

[Verse 2]
Some days the gales are howling
Some days the sea is still as glass
Ooh, reef the main sail
Ooh, lash the mast

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been way too long at sea
Now the shore lights beckon
Oh God, there's a price for being free, free

[Bridge]
Yeah, the seabirds cryin'
And there's a ghost wind blowin'
And it's calling you to that misty swirling sea
'Til the chains of your dreams are broken
No place in this world you can be

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
And you'vе been too long at sea
Now the shore lights bеckon
Yeah, there's a price for being free

[Outro]
For being free, for being free, being free
Going drifting, going drifting
Drifting and dreaming
Drifting and dreaming
Maybe going on a dream
Maybe going on a feeling
Ooh, drifting and dreaming
Drifting and dreaming
This is a place you've never been
Maybe a face you've never seen now
You can hear it calling on the wind
Drifting and dreaming
Drifting and dreaming
Go on and drift your life away
Drifting and dreaming
Maybe going on a dream now
Going on a dream now
Maybe going on a feeling
Maybe going on a feeling now
Maybe going on a feeling
Maybe going on a feeling
Hey

[Intro]
This one's for Bobby Sands

[Verse 1]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Verse 2]
Cat on a tin...on a ten mile ride
Hot as a pistol but cool inside
Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile
Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a stеam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gonе, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Going where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
I lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

[Verse 3]
Same old rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
He's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Outro]
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
('Cause he's gone, he's gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
('Cause he's gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(He's gone, gone, 'cause he's gone)
Oh, oh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Oh, oh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Gone, gone, well, he's gone for good)
Oh, oh, oh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Gone, gone, well, he's gone for good)
Oh, oh, oh, nothing's gonna bring him back

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
Well, the heat come 'round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around, y'all)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus come by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to Never Ever Land

[Outro]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around, y'all)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

Goin' where the climate suits my clothes
Goin' where the climate suits my clothes
Goin' where the climate suits my clothes
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Verse 1]
Old man down
Way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty
Asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

[Verse 2]
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine
More than my maker, though he's no friend of mine
Everyone said
I'd come to no good, I knew I would, Pearly, believe them
Half of my life
I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The other half found me stumbling around drunk on burgundy wine

[Bridge]
But I'll get back on my feet someday
The good Lord willing, if He says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should

[Refrain]
I'll get up and fly away
I'll get up and fly away, fly away

[Verse 3]
"Pearly's been true
True to me, true to my dying day," he said
I said to him
I said to him, "I'm sure she has been"
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Got up and wandered
I wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just hang around
I've got a girl
Named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Verse 1]
Well, I was feeling oh so bad now
Asked my family doctor about what I had now

Oh, can you tell me (Doctor), what's ailing me?" (Doctor)

He said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease
Don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Verse 1]
I was standing on the corner
Talking to Miss Brown
When I turned around, sweet mama
She was way across town
So I'm walking down the street
With a dollar in my hand
I've been looking for a woman
Sweet mama ain't got no man

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease
Don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
The girl I love, she's sweet and true
The dress she wears, sweet mama, it's pink and blue
She brings me coffee, she brings me tea
She brings me about every damn thing but the jailhouse key

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease
Don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Don't ease, don't ease
Don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

[Outro]
Don't ease, don't ease
Don't ease me in
I've been all night long coming home, don't ease me in

Thank you, good night

You want what now looks like, let me give you a taste

You can't get with this if you ain't built for this
You can't get with this if you ain't built for this
I can't build you up if you ain't tough enough
I can't teach a man how to wear his pants

[Instrumental Break]

I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe, but can't handle my sound
My sound, my sound

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company

We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far

Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars (Hey!)

[Verse 1]
Somewhere in the middle, I
Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window, yeah (Gonna break, gonna break)

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
Whеn my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at easе
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please

[Verse 2]
Exactly where I want me, yeah
Underneath your body, yeah
If we take it further, I swear I ain't gonna break
So, baby, come try me
Baby, come find me
Baby, don't wind me up

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension

Hate it when you leave me unattended

When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Verse 2]
I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Bridge]
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no (Oh no), I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Can you play physical for me?
Of course I can

[Verse 1]
Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?

[Pre-Chorus]
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?

[Chorus]
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on
Let's get physical

[Verse 2]
Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life
'Cause this one's pretty nice
Living it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?

[Chorus]
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)

Pretty Please (My Love)
I need your hands on me-me-me-me

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

[Pre-Chorus]
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't lovе me, so I tell myself, I tеll myself

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

Prisoner, prisoner, locked up
Can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa & Miley Cyrus]
Strung out on a feeling, my hands are tied
Your face on my ceiling, I fantasize
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it (I can't control it)
I try to replace it with city lights
I'll never escape it, I need the high
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
You keep making it harder to stay
But I still can't run away
I gotta know why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Miley Cyrus]
Prisoner, prisoner, locked up
Can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
Prisoner, prisoner, locked up
Can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
I tasted Heaven, now I can't live without it
I can't forget you and your love is the loudest
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it (Can't control it)

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa, Miley Cyrus & Both]
You keep making it harder to stay (Oh, ah)
But I still can't run away
I gotta know, why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus, Dua Lipa & Both]
Prisoner, prisoner, locked up
Can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
Prisoner, prisoner, locked up
Can't get you off my mind, off my mind (Off my mind)
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

[Outro: Miley Cyrus, Dua Lipa & Both]
Can't get you off my mind
Why can't you just let me go?
Million times
I wanna know why can't you, why can't you
I wanna know why can't you, why can't you
I gotta know why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

Kill me slowly with your kiss
Wrap me 'round your fingertips
Damn, I need another hit

I hallucinate when you call my name (Hey!)

[Instrumental Intro]
Hey!

[Intro]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(If you don’t wanna see me)

[Verse 1]
Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it’s scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took somе time to survive you
I’m bettеr on the other side
I’m all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I’m not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(Don't, don't, don’t)

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now, 'bout me)

[Bridge]
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now (Oh)
Up, up
Don't come out, out
I'm not where you left me at all, so

(Up, up, up; Don't come out, out, out; Don't show up, up, up; Walk away, walk away, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up (Don't show up), don't come out (Don't come out)
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now)
Walk away (Walk away), you know how (You know how)
Don't start caring about me now (So)

[Break]
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away (So)
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away, oh
(Walk away, walk away, oh)
(Walk away, walk away, oh)
Hey!

When I'm gone, I'm never really gone
You think you're movin' on
But it won't be for long, you'll see
I savour every moment
I know it’ll only be a couple days (Ah, ah-ah-ah)
Baby, it’s your atonement
To love me up until the heaven’s gate (Ah, ah-ah-ah)

Oh, don't you leave me this way
Won't you wait another hour or two?
You know I need you to stay
Don't make me beg for you 'cause I'll beg for you

Baby girl, you got my eyes on you
All of my attention is ​officially now focused on you
You're standing in the mirror, trying on all our underwear
Lying in your bed, imagining me all on you, yeah

You'll be loving it so much, you hate it
But still you want it cause I know where your spot is
And I'm willing to kiss it
Got you all in my bed, pulling off your Victoria secrets
So let's turn it up a notch
Let's act like black is all you got
Walk around, black stilettos on
Black room with black lights on

[Verse 1]
I am a child, I last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile
You hold my hand, rough up my hair
It's lots of fun to have you there

[Chorus]
I gave to you, now you give to me
I'd like to know what you've learned
The sky is blue and so is the sea
What is the color when black is burned?
What is the color?

[Verse 2]
You are a man, you understand
You pick me up then you lay me down again
You make the rules, you say what's fair
It's lots of fun to have you there

[Chorus]
I gave to you, now you give to me
I'd like to know what you've learnеd
The sky is blue and so is the sеa
What is the color when black is burned?
What is the color?

[Outro]
I am a child, I last a while
You can't conceive of the pleasure in my smile

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Dialog]
(That was really gross, folks
Shh, right here in Shakespeare's own place, man
But if you can live with it, I guess it's all right
It's not that serious)

[Verse 1]
It's so noisy at the fair
But all your friends are there
And the candy floss you had
And your mother and your dad

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Dialog]
(When I wrote this song, I wrote 126 verses
Every six months I have a meeting in my head
To decide what I'm gonna, you know, what makes it, what doesn't
That's happening here
The whole meeting was taken up with trying to figure out what verses to use
Nothing else got even brought up
I was only twenty years old
The verses were all so bad that I couldn't decide
But this verse here, I decided to use
Because I thought that out of 126 it was the worst one
And I thought it rated some merit there)

[Verse 2]
Now you're underneath the stairs
And you're giving back some glares
To the people that you met
And it's your first cigarette

[Dialog]
(Get it?
Now if I can stand up here in this great theater
In front of you university students and sing something like that
And you can't sing with me when I sing this part
It's a little imbalanced somewhere)
*sings* Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
(Yeah, sing it with me
Woo, sing it with me)

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 3]
Now you say you're leaving home
Because you want to be alone
Ain't it funny how you feel
When you're findin' out it's real?

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

(Let's do it once more, for William Shakespeare
Real loud, like it was really his twentieth birthday, folks)

Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon
Can you still remember how it all began?
With clipper ships and pink electric trees
Dawnlight on a skyline bridges' span
Street light on a rooftop memory
Then it was me and spring came
Playing a song of spring rain
A melody in your name
Night now comes much bluer than it used to be
The pink nun sings much sadder than before
She sings that sometimes things aren't what they
Seem to be, like moons reflected on the sixteenth floor
Love is no more, it's ended
Paper and pins won't mend it;
Even the moon pretended
There must be a reason, oh, there must be one
Keep your answers, let me find my own
Where do pretty stories get their endings from
If loving always leaves you all alone?
Kisses have shown me sorrow;
Love is a throne to borrow;
Pay for the loan tomorrow

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 1]
It's so noisy at the fair
But all your friends are there
And the candy floss you had
And your mother and your dad

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 2]
There's a girl just down the aisle
Oh to turn and see her smile
You can hear the words she wrote
As you read the hidden note

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 3]
Now you're underneath the stairs
And you're giving back some glares
To the people who you met
And it's your first cigarette
It's your first

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 4]
Now you say you're leaving home
Because you want to be alone
Ain't it funny how you feel
When you're findin' out it's real?
Real, when you're findin' out that it's real?
Ain't it funny how you feel
When you're findin' out it's real?

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that you're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 1]
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart, oh

[Chorus]
And this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Interlude]
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I tried my best to feed her appetite
And keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, yeah, oh
Keep playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But, oh

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

[Bridge]
I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright (Yeah, yeah)
My pressure on your hips, sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you 'cause I know that's what you want me to do, oh

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before, yeah
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before, yeah, yeah
And my heart is breaking in front of me, yeah
Because she said goodbye too many times before, oh
Yeah yeah, no no no no
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah, oh
This love has taken its toll on me (Oh, yeah, yeah)
She said goodbye too many times before (Yeah)
And her heart is breaking in front of me (Yeah)
I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me

[Outro]
So, uh, this song is called "Sunday Morning"
One, two, three

[Intro]
Yeah, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in

[Refrain]
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday, it would lead me back to you
That someday, it would lead me back to you

[Chorus]
That may be all I'll need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

[Verse 2]
My fingers trace your every outline (Yeah)
Paint a picture with my hands (No, no)
And back and forth, we sway likе branches in a storm
Change the wеather, still together when it ends, oh

[Chorus]
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Yeah

[Refrain]
Oh, oh yeah
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I’m calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you, yeah
Find a way to get myself back home to you

[Chorus]
And you may not know
That may be all, all I, all I need
Oh, in darkness, she is all, all I, I see
Oh, come and rest your bones with me, yeah
Driving slow, driving slow
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
It's a flower in your hair
I’m a flower in your hair
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah

[Outro]
Sunday morning, yeah
On Sunday morning, yeah, yeah
Sunday morning, no, no, no, oh
That may be all I need

[Verse 1]
Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while

[Post-Chorus]
She will be loved
She will be loved, yeah

[Verse 2]
Tap on my window, knock on my door, I
Wanna make you feel beautiful, yeah
I know I tend to get so insecure
Doesn't matter anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come any time you want, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while

[Post-Chorus]
She will be loved
She will be loved
She will be loved
She will be loved

[Bridge]
I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and makes me catch her
Every time she falls, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Tap on my window, knock on my door, I
Wanna make you feel beautiful

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while

[Post-Chorus]
She will be loved
She will be loved
She will be loved
Yeah (She will be loved)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah, yeah, oh, yeah, ooh, ooh

Drivin' expensive foreigns, ayy
You just a big dawg, yeah
I kenneled him in the backyard
No proper life to a dog
For a big dog

[Verse 1]
How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable
So condescending, unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step, 'cause if I do, you'll need a miracle
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
This double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay, but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walking on

[Chorus]
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we'rе gonna give up"
And like a little girl criеs in the face
Of a monster that lives in her dreams
Said, "Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe."

[Verse 2]
What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better, you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

[Chorus]
Hen it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up"
And like a little girl cries in the face
Of a monster that lives in her dreams
Said, "Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe."
Said, "Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe."
Oh, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, no

[Bridge]
And does it kill? Does it burn? Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control?
Does it thrill? Does it sting when you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold? yeah

[Chorus]
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love, oh
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up" (Ah)
And like a little girl cries in the face
Of a monster that lives in her dreams (Yeah)
Said, "Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe."
Said, "Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe." (Oh, oh)

[Spoken Outro]
Thank you! This room is amazing. We're really all so honored to be here, this is like a legendary place. One, two, three, four

[Intro]
Woo!

[Verse 1]
After school, walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
And trying to recreate
Images life gives us from our past
And sometimes it's a sad song

[Chorus]
But I, I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away, make every day
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, "The battlе's almost won
And we're only sevеral miles from the Sun."
Oh yeah, yeah, oh

[Verse 2]
Moving on, down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
I think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps, oh
And sometimes it's a sad song, oh yeah

[Chorus]
But I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you, and
Take my breath away, make every day
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, "The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the Sun."

[Bridge]
The rhythm of her conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
And on and on and on and on, yeah

[Chorus]
I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you, and
Take my breath away, make every day
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
Because things ain't how they used to be
She said, "The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles"
She said, "The battle's almost won, oh
And we're only several miles from the Sun."

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, oh
No no no no, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Break]
Oh, oh oh oh, oh, yeah
Oh oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh
Yeah yeah, oh, oh, oh oh oh

[Spoken Outro]
Thank you. So, uh, I didn't tell the band about this, but I'm just gonna spring it on them right now. I'm gonna do a little extra Beatles song for you guys

[Verse 1]
I asked her to stay, but she wouldn't listen
She left before I had the chance to say
Oh, oh
Words that would mend, yeah, the things that were broken
But now it's far too late; she's gone away

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, "Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
Hard to believe that

[Chorus]
It's not over tonight
Give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

[Verse 2]
The taste of her breath, I'll never get over, yeah
The noises that she made, kept me awake, hey
The weight of things that remained unspoken
Built up so much, it crushed us every day

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, "Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
Hard to believe that

[Chorus]
It's not over tonight
Give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
It's not over tonight
Give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Oh

[Bridge]
Of all the things I felt but never really showed
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
I should not ever let you go
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you, babe
Oh, oh
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

[Outro]
And I won't go home without you
I won't go home without you
I won't go home without you, babe

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right, then aim for my heart
If you feel like
And take me away
And make it okay
I swear I'll behave
You wanted control, so we waited
I put on a show, now I'm naked
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a, don't give a
And it goes like this, uh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Uh)
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Uh)
I don't need to try to control you (Uh)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them movеs like Jagger
I've got thеm moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Maybe it's hard, when you feel like
You're broken and scarred, nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I'll make you believe
That I've got the key
Oh, so get in the car, we can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
And you wanna steer, but I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here (Oh, yeah, yeah)
And it goes like this, uh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Uh)
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Uh)
I don't need to try to control you (Oh yeah)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger

[Bridge: Christina Aguilera]
Uh, you wanna know, how to make me smile?
Take control, own me just for the night
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this (Uh)
So watch and learn, I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh baby, rub me right
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
Hey, hey, hey, yeah (Hey, yeah, hey, yeah)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
(Uh) Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Uh)
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger (Woo)
I don't needa try to control you (Ooh)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you (Ooh)
With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Jagger)
Varnished weeds in window jars
Tarnished beads on tapestries
Kept in satin boxes are
Reflections of love's memories

Letters from across the seas
Roses dipped in sealing wax
Valentines and maple leaves
Tucked into a paperback

Guess I'll throw them all away
I found someone to love today

Dark with darker moods is he
Not a golden Prince who's come
Through columbines and wizardry
To talk of castles in the sun

Still I'll take a chance and see
I found somеone to love today
Therе's a sorrow in his eyes
Like the angel made of tin
What will happen if I try
To put another heart in him

In a Bleecker Street cafe
I found someone to love today
I need someone to love today
Get you a copper kettle
Get you a copper coil
Cover with new-made corn mash
And never more you'll toil

You'll just lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-fillin'
In the pale moonlight

Get you a fire of hickory
Get you a fire of oak
Don't use no green or rotten wood
They'll find you by the smoke

While you lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-fillin'
In the pale moonlight

My grandpappy he made whiskey
My daddy he made it too
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792
We just lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-fillin'
In the pale moonlight

Get you a copper kettle
Get you a copper coil
Cover with new-made corn mash
And never more you will toil

You'll just lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-fillin'
In the pale moonlight
John Hardy was a fightin’ man
Carried a razor everyday
Well he killed a man in Mobile town
You ought to see my Johnny get away
Ought to see my Johnny get away

Well get away, get away
Poor John, poor John

John Hardy was standin’ at the bar
So drunk he could not see
Along came a man with a warrant in his hand
Cryin’ Johnny boy why don’t you come with me
Johnny boy why don’t you come with me

Well get away, get away
Poor John, poor John

John Hardy had a pretty little girl
Kept her dressed in blue
Saw her in the hangin’ crowd
Cryin’ Johnny boy I’ll be true to you
Johnny boy I’ll be true to you
Well get away, get away
Poor John, poor John

I’ve been to the north and I’ve been to the south
Been this whole world ‘round
Well I’ve lived in the east and I’ve lived in the west
And this will be my buryin’ ground
This will be my buryin’ ground

Yes I’ve been this wild world over
Yes I’ve been this whole world ‘round
And I’ve been to the river
And I’ve been baptized
Take me to my buryin’ grounds

Well get away, get away
Poor John, poor John, poor John
Come all you young fellers
So young and so fine
And seek not your fortune
In the dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit
And seep in your soul
Till the stream of your blood
Is as black as the coal

Where it's dark as a dungeon
And damp as the dew
Where the dangers are double
And the pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls
And the sun never shines
Lord it's a dark as a dungeon
Way down in the mines

Well it's many a man
That I've seen in my day
Who lived just to labor
His whole life away
Like a fiend with his dope
Or a drunkard his wine
A man must have lust
For the lure of the mine
Where it's dark as a dungeon
And damp as the dew
Where the dangers are double
And the pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls
And the sun never shines
Lord it's a dark as a dungeon
Way down in the mines

Well I hope when I'm gone
All the ages shall roll
My body would blacken
And turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door
Of my heavenly home
And pity the miner
Who are digging my bones

Where it's dark as a dungeon
And damp as the dew
Where the dangers are double
And the pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls
And the sun never shines
Lord it's a dark as a dungeon
Way down in the mines
Tell old Bill when he gets home this morning
Tell old Bill when he gets home this evening
Tell old Bill when he gets home
Leave those downtown girls alone
This morning, this evening, so soon

Old Bill's wife she was bakin' bread this morning
Old Bill's wife she was bakin' bread this evening
Old Bill's wife she was bakin' bread

She said oh no it can't bе so this evening
She said oh no it can't bе so

This morning, this evening, so soon

They brought Bill home in a hurry-up wagon this morning
Brought Bill home in a hurry-up wagon this evening
Brought Bill home in a hurry-up wagon
Brought him home with his feet a-draggin'
This morning, this evening, so soon
Tell old Bill when he gets home
Leave those downtown girls alone
This morning, this evening, so soon
This morning, this evening, so soon
I am a weaver a Calton Weaver

I've got silver in my pooches
I'll gang follow the weaver’s trade
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

Now I rolled into Glasgow City
Nancy Whisky I chanced to smell
I went in, sat doon beside her
Seven long years I loved her well
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

Now the more I kissed her the more I loved her
The more I kissed her the more she smiled
I set forth on my mothеr's teachin'
Nancy soon had me beguilеd
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o
Now I rose the early morning
To quench my thirst it was my need
I tried to rise but I was not able
Nancy had me by the heid
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

Now I’m going back to the Calton weaving
I'll surely make those shuttles fly
I'll earn more at the Calton weavin
Than that I did in days gone by
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

So come all you weavers, ye Calton Weavers
Come all you weavers where e’re you be
Beware of Whisky Nancy Whisky
She'll ruin you as she ruined me
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o
Laszlo Thea stole a stallion
Stole him from the misty mountains
And they chased him and they caught him
And in iron chains they bound him

Word was sent to Ana Thea
That her brother was in prison
Bring me gold and six fine horses
I will buy my brother's freedom

Judge, oh, judge, please spare my brother
I will give you gold and silver
I don't want your gold and silver
All I want are your sweet favors

Ana Thea, oh my sister
Are you mad with grief and sorrow?
He will rob you of your flower
And he'll hang me from the gallows

Ana Thea did not listen
Straight way to the judge went running
In his golden bed at midnight
There she heard the gallows groaning
Curses be that judge so cruel
Thirteen years may he lie bleeding
Thirteen doctors cannot cure him
Thirteen shelves of drugs can't heal him

Ana Thea, Ana Thea
Don't go out into the forest
There among the green pines standing
You will find your brother hanging

[Intro]
Wait, wait, wait a minute
Wait, hol' up, wait a minute

[Verse 1]
I'm in my bag, she's likin' my style
I'm sportin' Louis V's and Jordan 23's
I took her back home to do some new things
She down the whole chaser, had a few drinks
I got drunk and nasty, came back in classic
Comin' a little close, it might make it little sassy
She like my style, I know all that shit
I'm down and I'm lit, she down and she thick (Now I'm screamin')
Wait, I grabbed the Rosé
It starts with my head, I'm having foreplay
I took her right down, lights down on my bed
Until I realize it's all in my head
She callin' my phone, I'm all in my way
And girl, in real life, I'm on the highway
You say you headin' down, I know you're not goin'
So baby, don't leave, comе on until I can scream out

[Chorus]
Wait, where you goin'? Wait
Baby, wait, whеre you goin'? Wait
Hold it down for me, wait a minute
Count on me, I'm on my way
Like five, four, three, two, one, just

[Verse 2]
Tell me without tellin' me you freaky, I'm tryna see (Yeah)
Tell me without tellin' me you ready, I'll count to three
One, two, three, put that bod all up on me
I can hardly wait to rock that body
Stay right there just like that, girl, I'm on the way
Call the paramedics (Hey), uh-huh
From the window to the wall, I'm smashin' (Hey) that bod-da-da
Now if you know, you know I got it, I put that on my mama
Stay right there just like that, I'm on the way (Hol' up, wait a minute)

[Chorus]
Wait, where you goin'? Wait
Baby, wait, where you goin'? Wait
Hold it down for me, wait a minute
Count on me, I'm on my way
Like five, four, three, two, one, just
Wait, where you goin'? Wait
Baby, wait, where you goin'? Wait
Hold it down for me, wait a minute
Count on me, I'm on my way
Like five, four, three, two, one, just wait
If I had wings like Noah's dove
I'd fly that river to the one I love
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

I've got a man, and he's long and tall
Moves his body like a cannon ball
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

They gave me a new man to share my bed
Sometimes I wish that I was dead
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

One of these mornings I know he's gonna set me free
There'll bе no more auction block for me
Fare thee wеll, oh honey, fare thee well

Yes one of these mornings and it won't be long
Them white bosses gonna find me gone
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well
In Dublin's fair city
Where girls are so pretty
It was there that I first met sweet Molly Malone
She wheeled her wheelbarrow
Through the streets broad and narrow
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"

Alive, alive, oh
Alive, alive, oh
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"

Now she was a fishmonger
And sure, t'was no wonder
For her father and mother
Were fishmongers too
And they both wheeled their barrow
Through the streets broad and narrow
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"

Alive, alive, oh
Alive, alive, oh
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"
Now she died of a fever
And no one could save her
Was then that I lost sweet Molly Malone
Now her ghost wheels her barrow
Through streets broad and narrow
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"

Alive, alive, oh
Alive, alive, oh
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"
Look at me
Won't you tell me what you see
Behind the tinsel flower lady
That you made me feel I must be

Don't you know
Even tinsel flowers grow uneasy
Shining all the time
Sometimes they find they can't even glow

Could you love a blue straw-flower
With no mystic magic power
Would you miss the glitter of your fantasy?
You know she isn't really me, baby

Just to please you
Maybe I can be a silver rose
But don't you know it's only straw-flower me?

Could you love a blue straw-flower
With no mystic magic powеr
Would you miss the glitter of your fantasy?
You know she isn't rеally me, baby, baby, baby
Write me a royal blue parchment poem
Draw me a royal blue lady like me
Draw me a smile
That's a lot like my own
And make my eyes flowers
And make my mind see
I will weave melodies only for you
And color them silver and saffron and blue

Build me a window to watch everything
Leave it unshuttered so nothing slips by
No season, no sorrow, no wonderful thing
No raspberry, strawberry sun in the sky
I will bring music and marsipan bars
And live deep inside you
Wherever you are

Tеach me the ways of the Gеmini twin
Show me the love that he says without words
Bring me his laughter again and again
The silence is singing, the quiet is heard
I will find harmonies waiting unsung
With two souls to sing them
Where once there was one
Funny day, looking for laughter and finding it there
Sunny day, braiding wild flowers and leaves in my hair
Picked up a pencil and wrote "I love you" in my finest hand
Wanted to send it, but I don't know where I stand

Telephone, even the sound of your voice is still new
All alone in Carolina and talking to you
And feeling too foolish and strange to say the words that I had planned
I guess it's too early, 'cause I don't know where I stand

Crickets call, courting their ladies in star-dappled green
Thickets tall, until the morning comes up like a dream
All muted and misty, so drowsy now I'll take what sleep I can
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand

[Verse 1]
Come closer, my love, and I'll tell you a tale
It'll make you cold, it'll turn you pale
It's a tale of a man's never ending love
And the long black rifle

[Chorus]
He wed a woman sworn to another
And, in a rage, the other man
Shot him down with a long black rifle
Shot him down, and away he ran

[Verse 2]
Now a prairie man loved a city maid
Was the love he took worth the price he paid
When a man ends up at the smoking end
Of a long black rifle?

[Chorus]
He wed a woman sworn to another
And, in a rage, the other man
Shot him down with a long black rifle
Shot him down, and away hе ran

[Verse 3]
Now his dyin' words, I repeat to you
You can nevеr kill love when your love is true
It lives when only the rust is left
Of the long black rifle

[Chorus]
He wed a woman sworn to another
And, in a rage, the other man
Shot him down with a long black rifle
Shot him down, and away he ran

[Outro]
I've loved playing...

[Intro]
Oh, hey
Oh, oh hey
Oh, oh, oh hey
Uh oh, uh oh
Oh, hey
Oh, oh hey
Oh, oh, oh hey
Uh oh, uh oh

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Wasted (Wasted)
And the more I drink, the more I think about you
Oh, no, no, I can't take it
Baby, every place I go reminds me of you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know
(I don't wanna know)
(You, you, you)

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
And every time I go out, yeah
I hеar it from this one, hear it from that one
That you got somеone new
Yeah, I see, but don't believe it
Even in my head, you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Do you think of me? Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name (Hmm)
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know
(I don't wanna know)
(You, you, you)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
No more "please, stop"
No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
No more tryin' to make me jealous on your birthday
You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this? Do he woo you like this?
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?
Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
May be his right now, but your body's still me, whoa

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know
(You, you, you)
(You, you, you)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Are we taking time or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to f- with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Oh yeah, whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 3: Future]
Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off, and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay in our league
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four-letter word
But the four-letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, girl, where your heart used to be
You gold-dig every day
I switched the four-door to the two-door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space
We going two separate ways

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Oh yeah, whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Future]
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah

[Verse 1]
He's a perfect stranger
Like a cross of himself and a fox
He's a feeling arranger
And a changer of the ways he talks
He's the unforeseen danger
The keeper of the key to the locks

[Chorus]
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner

[Verse 2]
There was a woman he knew
About a year or so ago
She had something that he needed
And he pleaded with her not to go
On the day that she left
He died but it did not show

[Chorus]
Know when you see him
Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner

[Instrumental Bridge]

Nothing can free him
Step aside, open wide
It's the loner

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

Acting like we're not together
Aftеr everything that we'vе been through
Sleeping up under the covers

[Intro]
(One, two, three, four)
Oh yeah
Mmm

[Verse 1]
Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets and
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Interlude]
Ooh yeah

[Verse 2]
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, where's your shame?
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

[Bridge]
Strange fascination, fascinating me
Ah, changes are taking the pace I'm going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-changes (turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, oh, look out you rock 'n rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes, pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Outro]
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

Jason Derulo

[Verse 1]
I can't read ya, my sexy Mona Lisa
Can't tell if you gon' leave here, or if you wanna stay
Girl, just ease up, don't yell in my two-seater
You say that you a freaker, but fall asleep at eight

[Pre-Chorus]
Sheesh (Sheesh), but you're perfectly
Dysfunctional, you crazy like my mama, mama
Sheesh (Sheesh), girl, you killin' me
But you won't see me with another lover

[Chorus]
Baby, oh-oh, you just a little loco
Like boats in Acapulco, I'm just ridin' the wave
Baby, oh-oh, you just a little loco
Emotions like a yo-yo, but I love you that way

[Post-Chorus]
Oh
There's something 'bout a crazy lover
Oh
I love you that way

[Verse 2]
Damn, that body, devil in Versace
Did I win the lottery or am I gonna pay?
Damn, you got me, like bitcoin and like Doge
I'm rich with you beside me, 'cause you're not coin-based

[Pre-Chorus]
Sheesh (Sheesh), but you're perfectly
Dysfunctional, you crazy like my mama, mama
Sheesh (Sheesh), girl, you killin' me
But you won't see me with another lover

[Chorus]
Baby, oh-oh, you just a little loco
Like boats in Acapulco, I'm just ridin' the wave
Baby, oh-oh, you just a little loco
Emotions like a yo-yo, but I love you that way, yeah (Sheesh)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh
There's something 'bout a crazy lover
Oh
I love you that way

Baby, oh-oh
Lyrics from Snippets

...What happens when the dreamers vanish?
I can hide it with a smile so you won't see the damage
Somebody once told me that I wasn't shit, I believed her
Tried to do anything to please her
But as I laid beneath her and realized I could no longer reach her...

...I fell out, and let her tell me I'm a sellout
No more help, I put this belt down
A battle in your own head is pretty common though
When you only еxist through an audio stream
They wouldn't hear mе if I screamed
They'll never know that they all are figments of a dream (Dream)...
Lyrics from Snippets

...Yeah
In the beginning of time, before we could find
The things in our mind and explain them
Had to be given a reason for breathin'
We slippin' and dreamin' of 

[?]
Didn't it all seem a little bit easier back then?
Rappin' was all but a hobby, I'm takin' it back to that
I have me an army 

[?] with anguish
This tug-of-war that's killin' me
I know I'm strong enough to...

...It's takin' its toll
On this concrete, my brain sits
Drugs explore the feelings
See, they lasted long enough to make me break from the mould
Take this and go, run and tell the others 'bout us
It could save mе your soul, I want it just to fuck around with
They wonder what my sound is, and ask me who I'm down with
Thеse countless questions 'bout complexions, yet the answer I don't know...

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
Friday
I'm dreaming a mile a minute 'bout somebody
This feeling, I wanna go with it, 'cause there's no way
We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight
Can tell you want me
By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe
No shame in the game, just cut the shit, be honest
Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you've got a job to do

And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

No rules
From the bar to the car, let's take it back to my room
Ignite in the heat of the moment, let the sparks fuse
Blowing up to the ceiling, we burning bright when we cut the light

The fire comes in, the sky falls down
There's no way I'm gonna be fighting this tonight, this tonight

I've always wanted what was off limits
Staring at you 'til I'm caught in this
Back and forth like this is all tennis
I'm all jealous, you came with someone
But we can tell that there are changes coming
See, I can tell that you're a dangerous woman
That means you're speaking my language, come on
Now follow me, let's go (Go)
Like Penelope in Blow
Well aware that stealing you is a felony, yeah I know
That's why they keep on telling me to let go, yeah

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Ooh (Na-na-na), yeah, yeah
Ooh (Na-na-na)

[Verse 1]
"Never look back," we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind
Where do I go?

[Pre-Chorus]
And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you know, still, I miss you somehow?

[Chorus]
From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

[Verse 2]
"Baby," I said, "Please stay" (Stay)
"Give our love a chance for one more day, oh"
We could've worked things out (Taking time is what it's all about)
Taking time is what love's all about (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But you put a dart
Through my dreams, through my heart
And I'm back where I started again, yeah
Never thought it would end

[Chorus]
From the bottom of my broken heart (My broken heart)
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

[Bridge]
You promised yourself
But to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still, I wish you were here now

[Chorus]
From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two (A thing or two) I'd like you to know (You gotta know)
(You were my first love) You were my first love
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
(You were my real love) You were my real love
I never knew love 'til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

[Outro]
"Never look back," we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?

[Verse]
I miss everything I knew about you
Wishing you could come back
Even when you hurt me
When I had the urge to love you
I wish I could go back to my old self
Not knowing you
My old self would never get into this much love

[Verse 1]
Don't call pretty Peggy, she can't hear you no more
Don't leave no message 'round her back door
They say the old laughing lady been here before
She don't keep time, she don't count score

[Verse 2]
You can't have a cupboard if there ain't no wall
You got to move, there's no time left to stall
They say the old laughing lady dropped by to call
And when she leaves, she leaves nothing at all

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 3]
See the drunkard of the village falling on the street
Can't tеll his ankles from the rest of his feet
Hе loves his old laughing lady 'cause her taste is so sweet
But the laughing lady's loving ain't the kind he can keep

[Verse 4]
There's a fever on the freeway, blacks out the night
There's a slippin' on the stairway just don't feel right
And there's a rumbling in the bedroom and a flashing of light
There's the old laughing lady, everything is all right
There's the old laughing lady, everything is all right

[Part 1]

[Verse 1]
Now that the holidays have come
They can relax and watch the sun
Rise above all of the beautiful things we've done

[Verse 2]
Go to the country take the dog
Look at the sky without the smog
See the world laugh at the farmers feeding hogs
Eat hot dogs

[Bridge]
What a pity
That the people from the city
Can't relate to the slower things
That the country brings

[Part 2]

[Verse 3]
Time itself is bought and sold
The spreading fear of growing old
Contains a thousand foolish games that we play

[Verse 4]
While people planning trips to stars
Allow another boulevard
To claim a quiеt country lane
It's insane

[Part 3]

[Verse 5]
So the subtlе face is a loser this time around
Here we are in the years
Where the showman shifts the gears
Lives become careers
Children cry in fear
Let us out of here

[Part 1 Reprise]

[Verse 1]
Now that the holidays have come
They can relax and watch the sun
Rise above all of the beautiful things we've done

[Part 1]

[Verse 1]

[Part 1 Reprise]

[Verse 1]
Now that the holidays have come
They can relax and watch the sun
Rise above the beautiful things we've done

[Verse 1]
On the turning away
From the pale and downtrodden
And the words they say
Which we won’t understand
"Don’t accept that what’s happening
Is just a case of all the suffering
Or you’ll find that you’re joining in
The turning away"

[Verse 2]
It’s a sin that somehow
Light is changing to shadow
And casting its shroud
Over all we have known
Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we’re all alone
In the dream of the proud

[Verse 3]
On the wings of the night
As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord
Using words you will find arе strange
Mesmerizеd as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
No more turning away
From the weak and the weary
No more turning away
From the coldness inside
Just a world that we all must share
It’s not enough just to stand and stare
Is it only a dream that there’ll be
No more turning away?

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky:
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking
He’s haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can’t be precise
He’s chained forever to a world that’s departed
It’s not enough, it’s not enough

[Verse 2]
His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

[Bridge]
One world, one soul
Time pass, the river roll

[Verse 3]
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea
A grim intimation of what is to be
There’s an unceasing wind that blows through this night
And there’s dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight
And silence that speaks so much louder than words
Of promises broken

[Guitar Solo]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me
Look around choose your own ground

[Chorus]
For long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

[Verse 2]
Run, rabbit, run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
When at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one

[Chorus]
For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
Balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave

[Introduction by French host]
At the Sports Palace (Palais des Sports) in Lyon and in front of a huge audience of 15,000 people, Pink Floyd! Here are the four boys you might know. Rick Wright, Roger Waters, Nick Mason, David Gilmour. Four great musicians who invite you to experience their fantastic music. Pink Floyd!

[Verse 1]
Little by little the night turns around
Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn
Lotuses lean on each other in yearning
Under the leaves the swallow is resting

[Hook]
Set the controls for the heart of the sun

[Verse 2]
Over the mountain watching the watcher
Breaking the darkness, waking the grapevine
One inch of love is one inch of shadow
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine

[Hook]
Set the controls for the heart of the sun

[Bridge]
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun...

[Improv]

[Verse 3]
Witness the man who raves at the wall
Making the shape of his question to Heaven
Whether the sun will fall in the evening
Will he remember the lesson of giving?

[Hook]
Set the controls for the heart of the sun

[Outro]
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun...

[Roger Waters]
Thank you!

[Verse 1]
The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high
The ravens all are watching from a vantage point nearby
Apprehension creeping like a tube-train up your spine
Will the tightrope reach the end? Will the final couplet rhyme?

[Chorus]
And it’s high time, Cymbaline
High time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me

[Verse 2]
A butterfly with broken wings is falling by your side
The ravens all are closing in, there’s nowhere you can hide
Your manager and agеnt are both busy on the phone
Sеlling coloured photographs to magazines back home

[Chorus]
And it’s high time, Cymbaline
High time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me

[Verse 3]
The lines converging where you stand
They must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy around your feet
You feel the thunder of the train
And suddenly it strikes you that they’re moving into range
And Doctor Strange is always changing size

[Chorus]
High time! Cymbaline
High time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me

[Improv]

[Interruption by French host]
Currently, thanks to electronic network machinery. The sound has a stereophonic effect on it, making it travel back and forth across the Sports hall in front of a very attentive audience, despite some rowdiness...

[Verse 3]
The lines converging where you stand
They must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy around your feet
You feel the thunder of the train
And suddenly it strikes you that they’re moving into range
And Doctor Strange is always changing size

[Chorus]
And it's high time! Cymbaline
High time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me

[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Lying supine in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]

You run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say...

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the fields
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells

[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Money, get away
Get a good job with more pay and you're okay
Money, it's a gas
I'm alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack
New car, caviar, four-star daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Money, get back
I'm alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack
Money, it's a hit
Don't give me that do-goody-good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set
And I think I need a Learjet

[Guitar Interlude]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: David Gilmour]
Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a rise, it's no surprise
That they're giving none away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away...
Lyrics from snippets

Chill, I'm from-

Ayo
With the golf boys, and we rollin' down
Weirdo, sure, with my bike
And I know you see the w-

But it's right on top of hills
So I see ya'll niggas cum like a penis in the-

Dollar, dollar, dollar bills, dollar bills

Shoutout my nigga

See 'ya dick
Let me see 'ya dick

Cold, 

[?] when a nigga let 'em know
Let me see 'ya dick, let me see 'ya dick
I know-

[Verse 1]
I want to set off alarms
Deal out the cards
Smell Cuban cigars
Get kicked out of a bar or two
But only if it's with you

[Verse 2]
I want to drive down to Texas
Flip off my exes
Get kinda reckless
Have one wild sex under the moon
But only if it's with you

[Chorus 1]
I got some baggage
Let's do some damage
I am not made for no horsey & carriage
You know I'm savage
You're looking past it
I want that late-night sweet magic
That forever lasting love
But only if it's with you

[Verse 3]
Let's crash a wedding tonight
Get drunk by the lights
Then I'll pick a fight
To make up on the floor of your room
But only if it's with you

[Verse 4]
And I want to cut off my hair
And kick off my boots
Dance in the wind just to do it again
Yeah, it's true
But only if it's with you

[Chorus 1]
I got some baggage
Let's do some damage
I am not made for no horsey & carriage
You know I'm savage
But you're looking past it
I want that late-night sweet magic
That forever lasting

[Chorus 2]
I'm kinda crazy
'Cause that's how you make me
I don't need Jesus 'cause baby you saved me
I'm down but only if it's with you, oh

[Post-Chorus]
You, only with you, you, you
You, only with you, you, you, you
You, baby it's you
You, you, only with you

[Verse 1]
Confidence is a must
Cockiness is a plus
Edginess is a rush
Edges, I like them rough
A man with a Midas touch
Intoxicate me, I'm a lush
Stop, you're making me blush
People are looking at us

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think you know (Know)

[Chorus]
I'm checking you, so hot, so hot

[Post-Chorus]
On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar

[Verse 2]
Interesting sense of style
Ten million dollar smile
Think I can’t handlе that animal in the sack
His eyes see right to my soul
I surrеnder self-control
Catch me looking again
Falling right into my plan

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think you know (Know)

[Chorus]
I'm checking you, so hot, so hot
Wonder if you know you're on my radar (On my radar)

[Spoken Interlude]
I got my eye on you
And I can’t let you get away

[Bridge]
Hey baby, whether it's now or later (I gotcha)

'Cause I got you on my radar
And whether you like it or not, it ain't gonna stop
'Cause I got you on my radar (I gotcha)

Valet, baby, here’s the keys

This is our song they're playing (They're playing)
I wanna rock with you (Rock with you)
You're feeling this right

[Bridge]
Gotta really let me know if you want me
You gotta turn me on and make me feel sexy
Gotta show me you got everything that I need
Gotta really let me know if you want me
You gotta turn me on and make me feel sexy
Gotta show me you got everything that I need
Oh, oh, yeah

[Chorus]

You gotta turn me on and make me feel sexy
Gotta show me you got everything that I need
Gotta really let me know if you want me
You gotta turn me on and make me feel sexy
Gotta show me you got everything that I need

[Lyrics from live performances]

[Verse 1]
I wanna set off alarms, deal out the cards
Smoke Cuban cigars, get kicked outta bars before two
But only if it's with you
And I wanna drive down to Texas, flip off my exes
Get kind of reckless and have wild, wild, wild sex under the moon
But only if it's with you

[Chorus]
I got some baggage, let's do some damage
I am not made for no horsey and carriage
You know I'm savage, you're looking past it
I want that late-night sweet magic, that forever-lasting love
But only if it's with you

[Verse 2]
Let's crash a wedding tonight, get drunk by the lights
Then I'll pick a fight to make up on the floor of your room
But only if it's with you
And I wanna cut off my hair and kick off my boots
And dance in the wind just to do it again, yeah, it's true
But only if it's with you, hmm

[Chorus]
I got some baggage, let's do some damage
I am not made for no horsey and carriage
You know I'm savage, but you're looking past it
I want that late-night sweet magic, that forever-lasting
I'm kinda crazy, 'cause that's how you make me
I don't need Jesus 'cause, baby, you saved me, I'm done
But only if it's with you, oh

[Outro]
You, only with you, yeah, yeah
You, only with you, yeah, yeah, yeah
You, baby, it's you
You, you, only with you

[Verse 1]
When we were living together
I thought that I knew you would stay
Still when you left me
I tried to pretend we could make it some way

[Chorus]
I don't care if all of the mountains
Turn to dust in the air
(What did you do to my life?)
It isn't fair that I should wake up at dawn
And not find you there
(What did you do to my life?)

[Verse 2]
It's hard enough losing
Without the confusion of knowing I tried
But you've made your mind up
That I'll be alone now, there's nothing to hide

[Chorus]
I don't care if all of the mountains
Turn to dust in the air
(What did you do to my life?)
It isn't fair that I should wake up at dawn
And not find you there
(What did you do to my life?)

[Outro]
I don't carе if all of the mountains
Turn to dust in the air
(What did you do to my life?)

[Verse 1]
Well, I used to drive a cab, you know
I heard a siren scream
I pulled over to the corner and I fell into a dream
There were two men eating pennies
And three young girls who cried
"The West coast is falling, I see rocks in the sky"
The preacher took his Bible and he laid it on the stool
He said "With the congregation running
Why should I play the fool?"

[Verse 2]
Well, I used to be a folk singer
Keeping managers alive
When you saw me on a corner
And told me I was jive
So I unlocked your mind, you know
To see what I could see
If you guarantee the postage
I'll mail you back the key
Well I woke up in the morning
With an arrow through my nose
There was an Indian in the corner
Trying on my clothes

[Verse 3]
Well, I used to be asleep you know
With blankets on my bed
I stayed there for a while till they discovered I was dead
The coroner was friendly, and I liked him quite a lot
If I hadn't have been a woman
I suppose I'd never have been caught
They gave me back my house and car
And nothing more was said
I caught a train to Baton Rouge
It was a deadhead

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
I was chopping down a palm tree
When a friend dropped by to ask
If I would feel less lonely
If he helped me swing the axe
I said, "No, it's not a case of being lonely we have here
I've been working on this palm tree
For eighty seven years"
He said, "Go get lost!" and walked toward his Cadillac
I chopped down the palm tree
And it landed on his back
That's too bad
If you ever come to our town
On a carousel crusade
And you're tired of fighting windmills with a nail
Cross the fence and join the dragons
Who have never made the grade
Cara’s castle and the keepers of a most unholy grail

Oh Cara, Queen of the losers, ruler of the weak
Give the poet what he chooses till he's too dumb to speak

There's a clock upon the mantle
But its hands forget the time
And the windows turn their backs upon the day
And thе people in the shadows
Could bе all lost friends of mine
Cara’s courtiers need no light need no light to lose their way

Oh Cara, Queen of the losers, ruler of the weak
Give the poet what he chooses till he's too dumb to speak

From the end to the beginning
Crippled minds retrace the steps
From the burial to the birth they do retreat
Wonderin’ where and when and why
Their souls were slaughtered while they slept
Cara’s courtiers know no victory know no victory just defeat
Oh Cara, Queen of the losers, ruler of the weak
Give the poet what he chooses till he's too dumb to speak

One by one the battered soldiers
Go slowly cross the moat
One by one they seek new castles somewhere else
With their crutches and the cravens
And I wonder is there hope
Is there hope for Cara’s courtiers and the wars against themselves

Oh Cara, Queen of the losers, ruler of the weak
Give the poet what he chooses till he's too dumb to speak
Dr. Junk the Dentist Man
Fills your teeth with what he can
Airplane wings and corset stays
And when he's done he'll let you pay
In paper clips or inner tubes
Or anything that's slightly used
He's not really crazy
Only nuts and bolts
And rusty rings make him do
The strangest things

Dr. Junk the Dentist has
An office full of colored glass
A garden with a paddle wheel
And funny plants for eye appeal
And though he watches them with care
I've never seen them growing there
He's not really crazy
Only nuts and bolts
And rusty rings make him do
Eccentric things
Dr. Junk thе Dentist built
A junky castle up on stilts
Junk within and junk throughout
And TV in the chimnеy spout
And fourteen levels to each floor
And now he's adding fourteen more
He's not really crazy
Only nuts and bolts
And rusty rings make him do
The strangest things

[Shrimpomaniac]
Smoke and mirrors steering clear of here
Watch you tear up interior
Inferior actions, mysterious convoluted satisfaction
To see the suffering of
All those like you're above us and not among us
It's not a concern to see you squirm like a worm in the beak of an eagle
It's evil
Step back we must progress to our sequel

Smoke and Mirrors disappearing when you're near us
Uncontactable, retractable
You must be held accountable for this

Timeland

Quit the chit-chatter, backstabber
Face up to the matter, on a silver platter
Talking and diving, you've been hiding
Undermining our capabilities
This operation is breaking, you're flaking, it's all unfolding at the seams
Another puppet to your strings
Another sucker with a broken wing (smoke and mirrors)
Another puppet to your strings
Another sucker with a broken wing (smoke and mirrors)
Another puppet to your strings
Another sucker with a broken wing (smoke and mirrors)
Another motherfucker trying to live the dream

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
She get in the picture

Never hit the bong
Never really come out the crib
You be stuck in the house too long

Blue bottle

Mc Queen got our eyes lazy
You're high as fuck when 

[inaudible]
Playing games and shit
I make you feel like a kid
Game room like Reachie Rich
And indoor pool with the slide built-in
Pick a car let you switch the paint
Wizzle got wings Wizzle got everything
Tell your parents they should chill
They don't want you to get High
But you will

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
What you smokin'? Take one toke bust your lungs wide open

Girl leave it to me, I'ma roll it

[Verse 1]
Sailing heart ships through broken harbors
Out on the waves in the night
Still the searcher must ride the dark horse
Racing alone in his fright

[Chorus]
Tell me why
Tell me why
Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself
When you're old enough to repay but young enough to sell?

Tell me lies later, come and see me

I am lonely but you can free me
All in the way that you smile

Be the rеal love that I need

And now I hope my dreams and inspiration
Lead me towards a real love

To the question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong
If I stay strong maybe I'll find a real love

[Verse 3: Sniper]
Now here's the deal, how I feel the effects are real
You're so deck, I break necks for your sex appeal
Stomp the court like Mike, throw up fists and fight
Your kiss is bliss and this is Mr. Right
I'm not a thug or steal, mug or deal drugs
Sniper's a crook with some looks and real love
We'll romance in France, when we slow dance
So what you say, Mary J., is there no chance?

[Verse 4: Mary J. Blige]
So I try my best and pray to God
He'd send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me
Towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful
I can be your all and all
And give you good lovin' through the summertime
Winter, spring and fall

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Real love
I'm searching for a real love
(For a real love, real love, real love)

And I don't know where to go
I've been around the world and high and low

'Cause it seems there's none around
I gotta end it in this way
Because seems he can't be found

Nah, yeah, nah, I just want her to sing on top of the beat
All the way down

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
I will love you anyway
Even if you can not stay
I think you are the one for me
Here is where you want to be
I just want to satisfy ya
'Cause you're not mine and I can't deny it
Don't you hear me talking, baby?
Love me now or I'll go crazy

Whoa-oh, sweet thing

Whoa-oh, sweet thing
Don't you know you're my everything?

[Interlude: Puff Daddy]
Nah, I want you to leave the music out
I just wanna do a little something for the Jeeps, you know what I'm saying?
Something kinda hardcore, something kinda hip-hop
Something our people could relate to, ha, a'ight?

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
I wish you were my lover
But you act so undercover
Love you child my whole life long

What'cha, the element
(That Brooklyn Funk, givin' you what you want)
Ha ha, that's what you want
(That Brooklyn Funk) That's what you want

[Verse 1: Elementry]
Looking for love in all the right places
Smiling faces, no one could replace this
My soul sick, so wait, and meditate
I know you got another man but it's all great, oh wait
The type of love in me will give you the shakes
But that's the breaks, your man ain't got no room for mistakes
I took a day to have you, and you have me
Let's put our heads together, make love like it's supposed to be
Bring it close to me, look into my eyes and see
The center of attraction, happiness bringing satisfaction
The thoughts are captioned, I'm quick with my heart
I try to start and visualize a walk in the park
And see that spark in your eye, Moschino jeans on your sexy thighs
Height five-five, you look about my size
Get it live, the way you make my nature rise
It's like the rain be understanding falling out of the sky

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Sitting here
Wondering why you don't love me
The way that I love you
And baby have no fear
'Cause I would never ever hurt you
And you know my love is real, boy, I can

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige]
I know some times
Can get rough but we'll make it
We'll make it through the storm
And I know I will try
To make sure that you can trust me
And you know the reason why that I say
(I can love you) I can love you
A little better than she can
(Oh) Oh, oh
(I know that you) I know that you
Wish that you could be my man
'Cause I can love you better than she can

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better than she can

[Verse 4: Dannii Ketch]
Check out my melody, yo, top notch, royal
Phenomenal, colossal
Class act, aristocrat, sex styles, I bless that
Keep it spectac', but on the real though, cut our collabo
Be faboloso, you let me know
Yo, are you robbin' on some info that your girlfriend told
Or how I sex slow, never let go on a liaison

[Verse 1]
Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor comin'
Sayin' something about a queen
There was peasants singin' and drummers drummin'
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowin' to the sun
That floated on the breeze
Look at Mother Nature on the run in the 1970s
We got Mother Nature on the run in the 1970s

[Verse 2]
I was lyin' in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eye
I was hopin' for replacement
When the sun burst though the sky
There was a band playin' in my head
And I felt like getting high
I was thinkin' about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie
Thinkin' about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie

[Verse 3]
Well, I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flying
In the yellow haze of the sun
There were children crying and colors flying
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream
The loading had begun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed to a new home

[Verse 1]
Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor comin'
Sayin' something about a queen
There were peasants singin' and drummers drummin'
And the archer split the tree
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun
That floated on the breeze
Look at Mother Nature on the run in the 1970s
We got Mother Nature on the run in the 1970s

[Verse 2]
I was lyin' in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eye
I was hopin' for replacement
When the sun burst though the sky
Thеre was a band playin' in my head
And I felt likе getting high
Thinking about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie
Thinking about what a friend had said
I was hopin' it was a lie

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flyin'
In the yellow haze of the sun
There were children crying and colors flying
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream
The loading had begun
Flyin' Mother Nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun
We were flyin' Mother Nature's silver seed to a new home
A long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible say
Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas Day

Shepherds watched their flocks by night
They saw a bright, new, shining star
And heard a choir from Heaven sing
The music came from afar

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new king born today
And man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas Day

Joseph and his wife Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
And found no place to bear her child
Not a single room was in sight

By and by they found a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger, cold and dark
Mary’s littlе baby was born
Trumpets sound and angels sing
Listen to what thеy say
That man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas Day
Trumpets sound and angels sing
Listen to what they say
That man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas Day

[Verse: The Weeknd]
This part I do alone
I'll take my lead, I'll take my lead on this road
And I need something (Something) to hold (To hold)
Make me believe in make-beliefs
'Cause after the light, is it dark? Is it dark all alone?
All alone

[Interlude: Jim Carrey]
You are now listening to 103.5 Dawn FM

Straight up out a movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
That'd turn my life to Stephen King's?

I told her there's some things she don't need to know

'Cause I don't want no RoboCop
You moving like a RoboCop
When did you become a RoboCop?
I really need you to stop

[Instrumental Outro]

[Monolauge]
Yo
I just want to talk about mind control.
You know, when people try to influence you through social media, and try to tell you what to do
Or if you post something that’s like positive on Instagram and gets taken down, if it’s not part of a bigger agenda, you know that’s like, mind control.
That’s the echo chamber, that’s tryna control you based off of incentivising you, and based off you getting enough likes. And that’s the poison that’s happening with social media.
And, you know for me, you know I just got back my IQ scores and they were Mensta level. One thirty three, Ninety eighth percentile.
Like straight up Sigmund Froy, Tеsla vibes.
And the worst thing, the way I feel likе.
I feel like when people try to tell me what to do. I feel like they’re touching my brain.
Like, for a woman, she doesn’t want nobody to— She wants to be in control of her body and choose who she wants to give it to.
And no one can come up and touch it, or, or take it, or tell her what to do with it, it’s up to her what she does with it. So I feel like that— with uh, my mind, like it’s all these people, black people...
Like, people on social media. People tryna control us and say that we’ll make us monolithic thought and then tryna control our mind. They’re tryna control my mind.
And then when someone tries to tell me what to do, tries to tell me what I can wear, and not wear.. I feel like they’re touching my brain. Imagine you like, cut your like skull open, and somebody like touched your brain, touch your brain with their hand, how that would hurt you.
That’s how it hurts me when people try to tell me what to do. When I’m going for my heart.
And like, you know, try to tell me what to say, this ain’t program, or try to tell me I'm not talking clear enough,
Like I don’t— clear— I say we doin- like I’ve- I’ve forgotten… How to talk not clear. Cause I’m so programmed to talk clear, to sound so proper, that gets in the way of how we really feel.
You know, we think so much.
You know you gotta just question like, when people get on TV shows, and, you know... Who are they doing business with?
What’re they connected to? What’s they agenda?
That people holding other people down, they want y'all all to be.. You know, just mind control!
It’s like a modern day psychological, like, and ran control thing, you know I just talked Jack tonight before I got Jack Dorsey, before I got— And he said that: “They’re working for the next 4 months on reprogramming to allow people to take off the followers” and allow people to take off the, you know, take off the likes because that, that works against your self worth.
You know, the beauty you have is inside you. It’s not based off how many records you sell, It’s not based on how nice your car is, like, one of the things they do, like soon as you get money.
They make you buy a house, like I got this house.. It’s never finished. Like, the house is just never finished. It’s just costing money after money, after money. It's like this big plot.
And like, yo, I’m really doing this because, like, I went to buy my publishing from Sony ATV
And they said it's like eight million, nine million dollars.
And when I went to buy it, they told me “No” I couldn’t buy my publishing, they told me I have the money to buy my publishing.
And they told me that “I couldn’t buy my publishing”
And, it’s just- it’s like the control, like I can’t say what I wanna say on SNL, that I can’t say what I wanna say— the things is
Let me change that, I will positive— Positive energy into the universe, we will say what we feel. Not what we’re programmed to think.
We will say what we feel. We will do what we feel.
We will do what we feel. We will do what we feel.
We will say what we feel. We will say—You see? I did that as a montra. I did it multiple times, and then you’ll get like—Man, I’m not worried about—I’m not worried about any type of blog, or, social media. Y'all already saw it was a lie.
Social media told you that Hillary’s gonna win, and she didn’t win. Social media told you that people didn’t like me, but everybody loves me! Everybody loves Ye!
But if you read social media, it makes you think something different. Unprogram your minds, open up your heart, Let the spirit guide you. Let your conscious be free. We free, we free bro!
Like, yeah, just positive energy. I’m saying this, I’m in Africa recording, you see we just took him to the future with the dome
The music is the best on the planet. I am the best, living, recording artist.
We, rather, because the spirits flow through me.
The spirit of Felah, the spirit of Marley, the spirit of Pac, flows through me.
We know who the best, we know. So don’t get it gassed up when you hear too much other stuff on the radio, that’s programmed that apart of a system.
It’s all apart of a system to control your mind. To control my mind. To make me look like I’m crazy to you—I’m not crazy.
I can ramp up if I suffer from sleep deprivation, I’m about to get some sleep.
You know I’m sayin’ like, a lot of people we’re trying to get off social media, get off Instagram, to not express myself.
We are creative individuals, we work from our heart. And our spirit, we’re not corny.
We work from our heart, and our spirit, we're not corny. We work from our heart, and our spirit, we're not corny.
It be corny people that control, to strategize, too planned out, too much of an agenda, too much of a angle on everything, we don’t have to do that.
Refresh, I got rid of my laptop. I had references there, I love—I don’t need references, the spirit will give me new ideas.
Ideas are in the air, we don’t own them, we are just merely a vessel. We’re here to do God's work.
We’re merely a vessel, and when you feel great art, that's the universe. And I have to be open, and free to do that.
And If I let human beings and people, humans rather, and people tell me what to do, tell me what I can’t do, then I can’t be a vessel to you. The reason why Pac did what he did cause he was a vessel.
He is, his energy never dies.
Bob Marley, vessel.
Felah, vessel. Ye, vessel.
Sony ATV told me I couldn’t buy my publishing—I got the money.
So Big John, Martey, whoever’s involved, I need my publishing.
I got the money, I’m not gonna say the S word. I’m not Prince, I don’t need to write it on my face.
Yeah, this is the transition. We free, our minds are free. Clear your mind.

[Verse 1]
I know that you're hiding something from me
That's been close to your heart
And I felt it creepin' up every day
Baby, right from the start
I know that look you give when we're fighting (Fighting)
We're fighting (Fighting)
'Cause I used to be the one who was lying (Lying)
Oh, lying (Lying)

[Chorus]
Oh, is there someone else or not?
'Cause I wanna keep you close
I don't wanna lose my spot
'Cause I need to know
If you're hurting him, or you're hurting me
If I ain't with you, I don't wanna be
Is there someone else or not?
Ooh, or not?

[Verse 2]
I don't deservе someone loyal to me
Don't you think I see?
And I don't want to bе a prisoner to who I used to be
I swear I changed my ways for the better, the better
'Cause I wanna be with you forever, forever

[Chorus]
Oh, is there someone else or not?
'Cause I wanna keep you close
I don't wanna lose my spot
'Cause I need to know
If you're hurting him, or you're hurting me
If I ain't with you, I don't wanna be
Is there someone else or not?
Ooh, or not?

[Verse 1]
I was born in a city
Where the winter nights don't ever sleep
So this life's always with me
The ice inside my veins will never bleed

[Refrain]
My, ooh
My, ooh

[Verse 2]
Uh, every time you try to fix me
I know you'll never find that missing piece
When you cry and say you miss me
I lie and tell you that I'll never leave, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I sacrificed (Sacrificed)
Your love for more of the night (Of the night)
I try to put up a fight (Up a fight)
Can't tie me down (Down)

[Chorus]
I don't wanna sacrifice
For your love, I try
I don't wanna sacrifice
But I love my timе

[Refrain]
My, ooh
My, ooh

[Verse 3]
I hold you through the toughest parts
When you feel likе it's the end
'Cause life is still worth living
Yeah, this life is still worth living
I can break you down and pick you up
And fuck like we are friends
But don't be catchin' feelings
Don't be out here catchin' feelings 'cause

[Pre-Chorus]
I sacrificed (Sacrificed)
Your love for more of the night (Of the night)
I try to put up a fight (Up a fight)
Can't tie me down (Down, down, down)

[Chorus]
I don't wanna sacrifice
For your love, I try
I don't wanna sacrifice
But I love my time
I don't wanna sacrifice
For your love (Oh), I try
I don't wanna sacrifice
But I love my time (My, ooh)

[Bridge]
Oh, baby
I hope you know that I, I tried
Oh, baby (Baby)
I hope you know I love my time, oh

[Outro]
I don't wanna sacrifice
I don't wanna, I try (Hey)
I don't wanna sacrifice
But I love my time
My, ooh
My, ooh

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Strike a pose with my kinfolk
Front page of the billboards
Suit and tie and cigar smokes
Macallan shots 'til it burn throats
We still celebratin' Super Bowl
Catalog lookin' legendary
Ring froze like it's February
XO, that's a mercenary
A quarter bill on an off-year
Used to sing on lofts
But now we cruisin' on a yacht, we clear, yeah
Said you wanted your boyfriend jealous with a couple pics
And you didn't expect to fall for me once you got this dick
The city dark, city dangerous
Your girlfriend's tryna pair you with somebody more famous
But instead you ended up with someone so basic, faceless
Someone to take your pictures and frame it
And my new girl, she a movie star
My new girl, she a movie star
I loved her right, make her scream like Neve Campbell
But when I make her laugh, swear it cures my depressin' thoughts
'Cause baby girl, she a movie star
Baby girl, she a movie star
I told myself that I'd never fall
But here we go again

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Ooh
Here we go again
Life's a dream
'Cause it's never what it seems
But you'd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all
So here we go again

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Although this love is strong to me
Some things can change, go wrong with me
We don't know how it's gonna be
Forever is too long to me
We don't need the government involved because we like to touch
We don't need no damn religion tellin' us that we in love
But if we did crush down the road, spendin' lawyer fees up
Pen and pad gon' save my ass if these feelings freeze up
You gon' sign this prenup, you gon' sign this prenup
You gon' sign this prenup, you gon' sign this prenup

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Ooh
Here we go again
Life's a dream
'Cause it's never what it seems
But you'd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all
So here we go again

[Outro: The Weeknd]
The number one station to free your soul (Free your soul)
Dawn 103.5

[Verse 1]
It's 5 AM my time again
I've soakin' up the moon, can't sleep
It's 5 AM my time again
I'm calling and you know it's me
I'm pushin' myself further
I'm just tryin' to feel my heartbeat beat (Beat)
I wrap my hands around your neck
You love it when I always squeeze
It's 5 AM, I'm high again
And you can see that I'm in pain (Ooh, ooh)
I've fallen into emptiness
I want you 'cause we're both insane
I'm staring into the abyss
I'm lookin' at myself again
I'm dozing off to R.E.M.
I'm trying not to lose my faith

[Chorus]
And I love it when you watch me sleep
You spin me 'round so I can breathe
It's only safe for you and me
I know you won't let me OD
And if I finally die in peace
Just wrap my body in these sheets (Sheets)
And pour out the gasolinе
It don't mean much to me

[Verse 2]
It's 5 AM, I'm nihilist
I know therе's nothing after this (After this)
Obsessing over aftermaths
Apocalypse and hopelessness (Hopelessness)
The only thing I understand
Is zero sum of tenderness (Tenderness)
Oh, baby, please, just hold me close
Make me believe there's more to live

[Bridge]
Around, around, around, around we go
In this game called life, we are not free

[Chorus]
And I love it when you watch me sleep
You spin me 'round so I can breathe
It's only safe for you and me (Don't let me go)
I know you won't let me OD (Don't you let me go)
And if I finally die in peace (Oh yeah)
Just wrap my body in these sheets
And pour out the gasoline
It don't mean much to me

[Verse 1]
We're goin' back in time
I'd like to see you try
Unpackin' thoughts through tunnels in your mind
I'll fix you mushroom tea
And cross the restless sea
Release yourself to escape reality

[Pre-Chorus]
It doesn't faze you
I need a breakthrough
I only want what's right in front of me
It's quite unusual
Seekin' approval
Beggin' for it desperately
I said

[Chorus]
How do I make you love me?
How do I make you fall for me?
How do I make you want me
And make it last eternally?
How do I make you love me? (Ooh, ah)
How do I make you fall for me?
How do I make you want me (Ooh, ah)
And make it last eternally?

[Verse 2]
I can see the real you, girl
You don't have to hide
Forget 'bout what your daddy said
I'll teach you how to shine
And all the things you tolerated
Made you cold inside
But I can light you up again
Like embers of a fire

[Pre-Chorus]
It doesn't faze you
I need a breakthrough
I only want what's right in front of me
It's quite unusual
Seekin' approval
Beggin' for it desperately
I said

[Chorus]
How do I make you love me? (Make you love me)
How do I make you fall for me? (How do I make you fall?)
How do I make you want me
And make it last eternally?
How do I make you love me? (Ooh, ah)
How do I make you fall for me?
How do I make you want me (Ooh, ah)
And make it last eternally?

[Spoken: Quincy Jones]
That's it
Looking back now, I didn't know what it was supposed to be
And it's like raising kids, man
If you weren't raised, you don't know how to raise, you know?
I just did the best that I could with them because
They know fuckin' well I love them
But I didn't do the best I could
I didn't know what the fuck I was doing
I didn't
I will never forget watching my mother get put in a straightjacket
And taken out of my home when I was only seven years old
She was diagnosed with Dementia praecox and put in a mental institution
Leaving my daddy alone with me and my little brother Lloyd
I latеr had an evil stepmother who furthеr cemented the idea that I didn't need a mother
Growing up without one had long lasting influence I didn't fully understand until much later in life
It bled into my relationships with family and those I had become romantically involved with
Whenever I got too close to a woman, I would cut her off
Part of that was vindictive and partially based on fear
But it was also totally subconscious
Looking back is a bitch, isn't it?

[Intro]
Ooh (I'm paralyzed)
Ooh
Ooh (Let's go)

[Verse 1]
I see you drowning in the purple lights
Diamonds shinin' bright
I see every ice on you
You snatch my soul, I'm crucified
I feel paralyzed
I'm so mesmerized by you (By you)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know you're right for me
Ecstasy
I keep coming back for more
I think that you would die for me
Destiny
And this time, I know for sure

[Chorus]
Just don't break my heart (Don't break my heart)
Don't let me down, please
Don't you break my heart (Don't break my heart)
I don't know if I can take it anymore

[Verse 2]
Take it anymore, take it anymore
I can't take another heartbreak or I'll end it all
And the girl I used to love
We broke up in the club
And I almost died in the discotheque

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I know she wasn't right for me
Enemy
I kept coming back for more
I'd rather you would die for me
Destiny
And this time, I know for sure

[Chorus]
Just don't break my heart (Don't break my heart)
Don't let me down, please
Don't you break my heart (Don't break my heart)
I don't know if I can take it anymore
Don't break my heart (Don't you, don't you)
I'm falling apart already
Don't you break my heart (Don't you, don't you)
I don't know if I can take it anymore

[Bridge]
I believe the liquor's talking
I just need the room to stop and
I could be the one you want
Just as long as you don't break my heart
And I realized
When I kissed your neck
That the room is hot
I can taste your sweat
It's just you and I
In the discotheque
But don't you worry

[Chorus]
Just don't break my heart (Don't break my heart)
Don't let me down, please
Don't you break my heart (Don't break my heart)
I don't know if I can take it anymore
Don't break my heart (Don't you, don't you)
I'm falling apart already
Don't you break my heart (Don't you, don't you)
I don't know if I can take it anymore

[Spoken: Jim Carrey]
You're tuned to Dawn FM
The middle of nowhere on your dial
So sit back and unpack
You may be here a while
Now that all future plans have been postponed
And it's time to look back on the things you thought you owned
Do you remember them well?
Were you high or just stoned?
And how many grudges did you take to your grave?
When you weren't liked or followed, how did you behave?
Was it often a dissonant chord you were strumming?
Were you ever in tune with the song life was humming?

If pain's living on when your body's long gone
And your phantom regret hasn't let it go yet
You may not have died in the way that you must
All specters are haunted by their own lack of trust
When you're all out of time, there's nothing but space
No hunting, no gathering, no nations, no race
And Heaven is closer than those tears on your face
When the purple rain falls, we're all bathed in its grace
Heaven's for those who let go of regret
And you have to wait here when you're not all there yet
But you could be there by the end of this song
Where The Weeknd's so good and he plays all week long
Bang a gong, get it on
And if your broken heart's heavy when you step on the scale
You'll be lighter than air when they pull back the veil
Consider the flowers, they don't try to look right
They just open their petals and turn to the light
Are you listening real close? Heaven's not that, it's this
It's the depth of this moment, we don't reach for bliss
God knows life is chaos, but He made one thing true
You gotta unwind your mind, train your soul to align
And dance 'til you find that divine boogaloo

In other words
You gotta be Heaven to see Heaven
May peace be with you

[Verse 1]
Remember I was your hero, yeah
I'd wear your heart like a symbol
I couldn't save you from my darkest truth of all
I know
I'll always be less than zero
Oh, yeah
You tried your best with me, I know
I couldn't face you with my darkest truth of all
Oh

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't shake this feeling that crawls in my bed
I try to hide it, but I know you know me
I try to fight it, but I'd rather be free
Oh

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah
Can we meet in the middle?
Oh yeah
'Cause you were just like me before
Now you'd rather leavе me
Than to watch me die in your arms, oh

[Chorus]
But I can't gеt it out of my head
No, I can't shake this feeling that crawls in my bed
I try to hide it, but I know you know me
I try to fight it, but I'd rather be free
Oh woah, oh

[Bridge]
(I can't get it out of my head)
(No, I can't shake this feeling that crawls in my bed)
(I try)
(I try)

[Chorus]
I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't shake this feeling that crawls in my bed
I try to hide it, but I know you know me
I try to fight it, but I'd rather be free

[Outro]
Yeah
I'll always be less than zero
You tried your best with me, I know

[Intro: The Weeknd]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah (Ah)
Oh, oh yeah
Mm-mm

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
The way you hypnotized me, I could tell (Uh)
You've been in control
You manifested this, but girl, I blame myself
Things I shoulda known
The whispers that I hear
Are blowin' through my ears
These words I need to hear from you
And I know this is a fling
But you're hidin' someone's ring
It hurts to think I'm sharin' you

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Ooh, I heard you're married, girl
I knew that this was too good to be true
Ooh, I heard you're married, girl, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
If you don't love him (Oh no)
Then do yourself a favor and just leave him
Your number in my phone, I'm gon' delete it
Girl, I'm way too grown for that deceivin'
'Cause I don't play, I don't play
Now I'm sure you have your issues and your reasons (Reasons)
But why you even with him if you're cheatin'? (Cheatin')
And I thought you were someone that I could be with (Yeah)
And it kills me that I'm sharin' you

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Oh, I heard you're married, girl
I knew that this was too good to be true
Ooh, I heard you're married, girl, oh, oh, oh
And I hate it
Ooh, I heard you're married, girl (Married, girl)
The way you had me wrapped around your finger too
Ooh, I heard you're married, girl, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
I can't be with you
No, I can't be with you
You're too deceiving, girl, oh (Ooh)
I can't be with you (Yeah)
No, I can't be with you
You're too deceiving, girl
Oh, yeah

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Can't be your side bitch
That shit ain't fly, bitch
Can't be your pilot
Can't be your private
Make me your obvious
If I ain't your husband, I can't be your hybrid
I heard you're married
I bet he treats you like Virgin Mary
You like it dirty and I'm Dirty Harry
I thought we were some love birds, canaries, word to Larry
But I can't fuck with you
You put my love on the line and then hang up on you
That's a long kiss goodbye, I gotta tongue kiss you
And when doves cry, we ain't got enough tissue
I'm still in love with you
Where the love at?
You walk down the aisle, I can make you run back
Like, fuck that, where the love at?
And tell hubby I'll kill him, no hub cap

[Chorus: The Weeknd, Lil Wayne & Both]
Woah, woah (Woah, woah)
Oh, I heard you're married, girl (Married, girl)
I knew that this was too good to be true
Oh, I heard you're married, girl, oh, oh, oh (Woah, woah)
And I hate it (Oh, I hate it)
Ooh, I heard you're married, girl (Married, girl)
The way you had me wrapped around your finger too (Your finger too)
Oh, I heard you're married, girl, oh, oh, oh (I heard you're married, and baby, I hate it)

[Outro: The Weeknd]
I can't be with you
No, I can't be with you
You're too deceiving, girl, oh (Ooh)
I can't be with you (Yeah)
No, I can't be with you
You're too deceiving, girl (Ooh, ooh)
I can't be with you (Oh yeah)
No, I can't be with you
You're too deceiving, girl, oh (Talk to me, say)
I can't be with you
No, I can't be with you
You're too deceiving, girl (Ooh)
I only met you in my dreams before
When I was young and alone in the world
You were there when I needed someone
To call my girl
And now you're my reality
And I wanna feel you close
But you're defeated, baby
Broken, hurtin', sufferin' from a shattered soul
Oh woah, a shattered soul
Oh, oh-oh

Let me be there
Let me be there for your heart
Let me be there
I can be there 'til you're whole
You weren't touched by a man in so long
'Cause the last time, it was way too strong
Let me be there
Let me be there for your heart
Let me love you
Let me love you like you need
And I'll make it
Make it my responsibility
I'll be there every step of the way, uh
I'll get you back on your feet
Let me love you
Let me love you like you need
And you can kick me
Kick me to the curb
It's okay, baby
I promise that I felt worse
Back then, I was starry eyed
And now I'm so cynical
Baby, break me
Kick me to the curb
Oh woah
Mm-mm

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, what we got
Baby, what we got is secure
Been a part of toxic love
It tore us apart
Things you want, I'm not lookin' for
You're my best friend now
You're my best friend now
Oh, I don't want to be responsible
For your heart if we fall
'Cause I'll get clumsy and tear it apart
I love you so, but we can't get close
You're my best friend now
You're my best friend now

[Verse]
Oh, I love it when we climax (Climax)
And I would never burn you
I could never hurt you
If we do it like that
Don't try to take it further
Focus on the friendship
Get a little sidetracked
Catchin' little feelings
Thought we had arrangements
Thought you weren't like that
Yeah (Uh-uh), I thought you weren't like that

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, friends no more
Sex as friends no more
You don't wanna have sex as friends no more
Friends no more
Ooh, friends no more, uh
Sex as friends no more
You don't wanna have sex as friends no more
Oh

[Chorus]
Oh, what we got (Oh yeah)
Baby, what we got is secure
Been a part of toxic love
It tore us apart (Oh yeah)
Things you want, I'm not lookin' for (I'm not searchin')
You're my best friend now (Oh, baby)
You're my best friend now
Oh, I don't want to be responsible
For your heart if we fall (Oh no)
'Cause I'll get clumsy and tear it apart
I love you so (Oh yeah), but we can't get close
You're my best friend now (Best friend now)
You're my best friend now (Best friend now)

[Outro]
Dawn FM (Radio)

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
The last few months, I've been workin' on me, baby
There's so much trauma in my life
I've been so cold to the ones who loved me, baby
I look back now and I realize

[Pre-Chorus]
And I remember when I held you
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind

[Chorus]
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Ah)

[Verse 2]
If he mess up just a little
Baby, you know my line
If you don't trust him a little
Then come right back, girl, come right back
Give me one chance, just a little
Baby, I'll treat you right
And I'll love you like I shoulda loved you all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
And I remember when I held you (Held you, baby)
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay (Never again, baby)
And I regret I didn't tell you (Hey)
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind (Uh)

[Chorus]
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time (No)
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time (Hey)
Said I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Ah)

[Outro: The Weeknd]
Ooh, singin', out of time
Said I had you to myself, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
But I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Uh)
Out of time
Out of time

[Spoken Outro: Jim Carrey]
Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says, you are out of time
You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come
Before you're completely engulfed in the blissful embrace of that little light you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed, forgiven, and refreshed
Free from all trauma, pain, guilt, and shame
You may even forget your own name
But before you dwell in that house forever
Here's thirty minutes of easy listening to some slow tracks
On 103.5 Dawn FM

[Intro]
You know it's family first off top, and blood is thicker than water
And there's no friend indeed like a friend in need (Why?)
But there's one thing you gotta watch and that's a friend in greed (Why?)
Lil' Ice you one years old right now, it's time that you learn more about your pops
I know you was born rich and you the baby CEO (For sure)
But know one think, you gotta know that's a cruel world out here
And everybody's not your friend, you hear me? (Not at all)
Your dad always got your back (J. White, I need a—)

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you a lil' story about this boy named 'Wop (Well, damn)
A lil' local corner boy who used to serve crack rocks (Rocks)
He drove a old-ass Buick, it had plastic in the window (Buick)
And every time you see him, under his shirt, pulled the extendo
Brother from a different mother, we won't name no names (Mom)
We used to pick up cash together, tradin' Nintendo games (Yeah)
We started trappin', went to rappin', we was like MJ and Pippen (Yeah)
When one of us was score, the other one would be assistin' (Skrrt)
Now this a low down, dirty, bitch, don't let them play you out position (Nah)
Your ego will have you thinkin' that your friend's, your opposition (Huh?)
Man, everything we ever got, we got that out the kitchen (Kitchen)
And we went in the booth, was 'cause we probably water-whippin' (Skrrt)
Tried to play divide and conquer, but we winnin' competition (Yeah)
Like, how the fuck you ain't gon' give Guwop his recognition? ('Wop)
Some artists get on and forget who came up with 'em in the trenches (Well, damn)
But just like an asshole, I guess we all get an opinion ('Wop)

[Chorus]
Friends (Go), not many of us have them, let's talk about friends (Let's talk about it)
Not ones we can depend on, let's talk about friends (No, no, naw)
'Cause not many of us have them, I'm talkin' 'bout friends (Let's talk about it)
Not ones we can depend on (Go)

[Verse 2]
I remember in the pen', I didn't have much friends (Nah)
Some people thought I do twenty, some said I do ten (Well, damn)
Please protect me from my enemies and so-called friends (Yeah, yeah)
They never thought that I'd be back, but it was all God's plan (Yeah)
No commissary, letter, man, them folks didn't vist (Yeah)
Wouldn't be surprised now that Guwop won't kick it (No, no)
Got married when I got out, that was my single best decision (Yeah)
Now I'm like, "Fuck a friend, I need one like a co-defendant" (Woah)
Ever been stabbed in the back by your right-hand man? (Right-hand)
Don't never tell your left hand what your right got planned (Well, damn)
To keep some people out my business, had to burn a couple bridges
'Cause gettin' played for a fool went out of style with True Religion (Woah)
Your friendships slow as some friendships grow (Grow)
Grew with friends back then, but we not friends no more (No)
Yeah, it's some friends like family and friends like bros (Bros)
But there's some friends gettin' jealous, that's when friends turn foes (Well, fuck)

[Chorus]
Friends (Go, go, go), not many of us have them, let's talk about friends (Let's talk about it)
Not ones we can depend on, let's talk about friends (No, no, naw)
'Cause not many of us have them, I'm talkin' 'bout friends (Let's talk about it)
Not ones we can depend on (Go), friends (Well, damn)

[Outro]
Friends (Yeah)
You know us, no
You know it's a hit 'cause J. White just picked a stick
Friends
No

[Intro]
Turn up, turn up
(Laughs)

[Verse]
He's gonna shoot me when he hears the news
I'm such a rebel, I just wanna break the rules
Right when he told me, when he told me not to do it
Fell off the wagon again

[Pre-Chorus]
All out, all out
We keep on drinking 'til we crawl out, crawl out
And get some sleep, when we are passed out, passed out
Wish I could do this every day for the rest of my life

[Chorus]
Don't you let my daddy know I'm in the club again
You see, I promised him that I would be in by 10
Don't let my daddy know I kissed someone I just mеt
I wanna take it off
My clothes are sticky and wеt

[Hook]
Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't you let my daddy know I'm in the club again

[Drop]

[Hook]
Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't you let my daddy know I'm in the club again

[Verse]
He's gonna shoot me when he hears the news
I'm such a rebel, I just wanna break the rules
Right when he told me, when he told me not to do it
Fell off the wagon again

[Pre-Chorus]
All out, all out
We keep on drinking 'til we crawl out, crawl out
And get some sleep, when we are passed out, passed out
Wish I could do this every day for the rest of my life

[Chorus]
Don't you let my daddy know I'm in the club again
You see, I promised him that I would be in by 10
Don't let my daddy know I kissed someone I just met
I wanna take it off
My clothes are sticky and wet

[Hook]
Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't you let my daddy know I'm in the club again

[Drop]

[Hook]
Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't let my daddy know, oh-woah
Don't you let my daddy know I'm in the club again

[Intro]
Ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, woah

[Spoken Word]
Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angels' order?
Even if they pressed me against their heart, I’d be consumed
For beauty is the terror we endure
While we stand and wonder, we're annihilated
Every angel is terrifying

[Verse 1: Dennis Edwards]
Knock on my door, it's a letter from the war
Saying, "Greetings, we want you"
If I refuse to fight they say that ain’t right
And time you'll have to do
Somebody please tell me what is war all about?
Why must I kill against my will?
I just can’t figure it out
Oh oh oh oh

[Chorus: Dennis Edwards]
Does anybody give a damn, yeah
About the men in Vietnam?
Why don't you stop the war right now?
Oh oh oh oh, stop the war (Right now)

[Verse 3: Dennis Edwards]
Think about all the soldiers
That are dead and gone today
If you’d ask them to fight again
What do you think they’d say?
I’m not trying to be funny
I'm just trying to get a point across
War is world's enemy #1
And it's time that we called it off
Oh oh oh oh

[Chorus: Dennis Edwards]
Does anybody give a damn, damn
About the men in Vietnam?
Why don't you stop the war, hey hey, right now?
Oh oh oh oh, stop the war, war, right now (Right now)

[Verse 4]
More casualties pile up each day
Cemeteries are overflowing
The leaders of the world claim peace is near
But the death list keeps on growin'
And what does a mother get in return
For the life of the son she’s lost?
A few measly pennies a month
A medal, a grave, and a doggone cost

[Chorus: Dennis Edwards]
Does anybody give a damn, damn
About the men in Vietnam?
Why don't you stop the war, oh oh, right now?
Oh oh oh oh, stop the war, war, right now (Right now)

[Bridge]
(Enough blood's been shed
By the wounded and the dead
Sing it, sing it, sing it
Enough blood's been shed
By the wounded and the dead
Everybody sing it
Enough blood's been shed
By the wounded and the dead
Sing it to my brother, now
Enough blood's been shed
By the wounded and the dead
Listen, listen, listen, listen (Woo))

[Outro/'Firework']
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again?
Lyrics from Tiktok snippet

[Chorus]
Sometimes I just can't stand to be with you, that's why
That I knew this all along
I had a picture on my mind
So please don't try and call my bluff
I don’t think we can try to fight it

[Verse 1]
Funny girl, you look so unassuming
Right up until the room you're captivating
Starts to fill with gut-busting laughter
And you're transformed into a five foot Cleopatra

[Verse 2]
Funny girl, your schedule's pretty crazy
Doing interviews for the new live action Cathy
Could you pencil in an industry outsider?
Yeah, you're young but, baby, you're not getting younger
Funny girl

[Verse 3]
For once your timing wasn't great
I must have missed you by a day
But, baby, things have turned out pretty good this way
And I don't think either of us yearns to share the stage

[Verse 4]
Funny girl, you seem pretty indifferent
But you knocked me out when you charmed the pants off Letterman
Oh I wish you'd flash that manic smile in my direction
And let me lead you to your seat like we were old friends
Funny girl
I was a fool to begin with
Long before this dance began
Oh, there's no mistaking
What you're saying
With that moony glance
Only a fool would understand

I was a fool when I met you
And, oh, I bet you knew it, too
How else could we stay standing?
All those nights dream-landing
Only a fool would understand

The wisdom of the ages
From Gita to Abraham
Was written by smitten, lonely sages
Too wise to ever take a chance

Life can be cruel now and then
But I couldn't fathom way back when
How I'd long to have you
Break my heart time and again
Only a fool would understand
Only a fool would undеrstand
Chloë is a borough socialist
She insists there's not much more to it
Than drinks with a certain element
Of downtown art criticism

I benefit more than I should admit
From her unscrupulous therapist
How Benzedrine supposed to address
Your shoplifting is anybody's guess

Chloë
Chloë
Please don't ever change

That story that continues to persist
How you could have dropped the cigarette
On the trip your boyfriend’s canoe flipped
Doesn’t loose your grip on me a bit

She and I, we were insеparable
'Til Ma called my East Coast uncle to
Ascеrtain the welfare of her son
Howard said "Mary, you’d better come"
Chloë
Her name is Chloë
And he's talking awful strange
But the more they abhor you
The more I adore you

I would but I can't
My heart don't stand a chance
Of even a glance
Her soul is a pitch black expanse

Summer ended on the balcony
She put on Flight of the Valkyries
At her thirty-first birthday party
Took a leap into the Autumn leaves
This may be the last time
The last time I put on my shoes
Go down to the corner
And buy the damn cat the expensive food

That Turkish Angora is 'bout the only thing left of me and you
Early this morning, it started making sounds that say
"Don't the last time come too soon?
One down, eight to go, but it's no less true
Don't the last time come too soon?"

This may be the last time
Last time I get out of bed
Put coffee on and try, in your words
"To show some initiative"

We used to lay around here laughing
At what these freaks out there were trying to prove
Well, what's wasting time if not throwing it away on work
When the last time comes so soon?
Mr. Blue died in my arms, nothing they could do
Don't the last time come too soon?
Love's always gonna leave ya
No matter what they say
You only know what it is once it's gone away

This may be the last time
The last time I lay here with you
Do you swear it's not the cat?
You don't have to answer that
I'll just make do

But maybe if he'd gone sooner
Could've brought us back together last June
When the last time was our last time
If only then I knew
The last time was our last time
Would've told you that the last time comes too soon
When the last time was our last time
Should've told you that the last time comes too soon
I swore I wouldn't do this
The wine's gone to my head
The ferryman's been stranded
Stay with me tonight instead

The end will not befall us
The sky will not descend
Life can be more sweet than bitter
If you'll only let me in

Kiss me
Kiss me
Like long ago
Kiss me
I still know
Our dream
Ended like dreams do
But kiss me
I loved you

I heard everything about you
And maybe half of it was true
Love is much less a mystery
Than who you give it to
Kiss me
Kiss mе
Like long ago
Kiss me
I'm still yours
Baby
Our dream
Endеd like dreams do
But kiss me
Don't you miss me?
Kiss me
I loved you
Her parade on the ceiling was looking like rain
When he came by to borrow some blue sky
"I'm sleeping," she said "after a long night's dreaming"
"Hard pressed for a reason to get out of bed"

Here he is begging for less than enough
I'll give you everything but
Her love
Everything but her love
Her love
Everything but her love

I can offer you sheets by the mile
If the Carlyle is out of rooms
I'm good for it, why don't you ask
But I can't bring her back
Now why would I do that?

When I ask what he wants, his only response
Is a single word less than I need
He watches TV, she reads the I-Ching
And I keep my face nearly straight
When he tries to leave
She must be a dream 'cause you never wake up
I'll give you everything but
Her love
Everything but her love
Her love
Everything but her love
Her love
Everything but her love
Her love
Everything but her love
Everybody's girl
What's the point of being everybody's girl?
Maybe you think that way there's no chance getting hurt
Living for no one costs me way more than it's worth

So you’re gonna be a singer
Well I’ll be, goddamn
You’re as pretty as a postcard
No thanks to the old man
It’s the same coat I had on
The night that I went in
I can stay an hour at Canter’s
The streets cool off by then
When can I see you again?

Whatever happened to the girl I knew?
In the wasteland, come up short and end up on the news

Whatever happened to the girl I knew?
In the wasteland, come up short and end up on the news
Everything you want
What's the fun in getting everything you want?
I wouldn't know, but look baby, you should try
Forget that lefty shit your mom drilled in your mind

Give the world a new savior
Sell his pictures to the press
Buy a place out in the country
Leave this world for someone else
My destruction is an hour late
I'm at Buddy's Rendezvous
Telling the losers and old timers
How good I did with you
They almost believe me, too

Whatever happened to the girl I knew?
In the wasteland, come up short and end up on the news

Whatever happened to the girl I knew?
In the wasteland, come up short and end up on the news

Whatever happened to the girl I knew?
In the wasteland, come up short and end up on the news

[Verse 1]
Simone writes little of much consequence
Unless the theater’s how you pay the rent
A new work of some semi-memoir sits
Inside the weekend book editors desk
And while they have not mentioned it
She must watch roses get thrown at less
Oh, the indignity

[Chorus]
It was just the thing for their Q4
“Deeply funny” was the rave refrain
It was just the thing for their Q4
It’ll be on stands before the holidays

[Verse 2]
Hеr sister was not much long for this world
She danced as if a dancеr danced as if
As if she had a body to sustain
As if an audience to entertain
This ironic distance kept her sane
While her vessel sailed away
It was all very literary
And the truth was

[Chorus]
It was just the thing for their Q4
What’s “deeply funny” mean anyhow?
It was just the thing for their Q4
These are the stories that we need right now

[Bridge]
How could she compete?
(I’m sure she wouldn’t mind)
With a memory such as she
(But who else than I)
Leigh died so many months ago
(Could write the story of her life?)
“By now this tragedy’s my own!”
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
It was just the thing for their Q4
“Deeply funny” was the rave refrain
It was just the thing for their Q4
It’ll be on stands before the holidays
It was just the thing for their Q4
The film adaptation was a total mess
It was just the thing for their Q4
’Til she was outed for her privilege
It was just a thing for their Q4
Can’t see her brother now unsupervised
It was just the thing for their Q4
Her family switched care right when she inquired
I have something to tell you
I can’t use my hands to sign
And even if I could manage it dear
I’m not sure i’d catch your reply

Olvídalo
Otro momento
Olvídalo
El destino decide

You’re listening so intently
As on and on I go
My flights leaving at 7 am
La noche casi se ha ido

Olvídalo
Otro momento
Olvídalo
El destino decide

All I want to say is words have failed me many time before
But never so completely as with you

[Verse 1]
She says, “The odds are against him
She won't break his heart"
He says, “You'll lose the one sooner or later
Just being who you are”

[Pre-Chorus]
This conversation's at an impasse
Maybe the future will look brighter undressed

[Chorus]
We could be strangers for one night longer
Save the trysts and tumors for tomorrow
'Cause no one's really better off
No one's really better off alone

[Verse 2]
She says, “No point speeding back to your place
I've got no other plans”
As they lay there bleeding on the freeway
He takes her by the hand

[Pre-Chorus]
“I never wanted to disappoint you
At least I'll never even get the chance to”

[Chorus]
We could be strangers for one night longer
Save the trysts and tumors, the nights at home
We could be strangers for one night longer
Leave the crazy highs and the crazy lows
We could be strangers for one night longer
Who any of us are, well, nobody knows
'Cause no one’s really better off
No one’s really better off alone
The nazis that we hired
For our wedding band
Played your anthem like I wasn't there
For the father-daughter dance
From the boondocks of Egypt
To the nosebleeds at Calvary
Recite your history of oppression, babe
While you are under me
There's no doubting the devotion my ancestors had for yours
Now we've got all the love to pay for like a thousand different wars

A square foot of empire
Around the peep show slot
I see an avatar of mercy
With the same damn jeembles that I got
The boss wants to be anonymous
The talent wants to be seen
We weren't paying for your body, lord
We were paying you to leave
Now who will watch the chorus line stretching from Reno to Rome
Listen, Cherry, I know you love me but say you love me 'fore you go
Val Kilmer had a wall length mirror just over there
Well, I'm sure he's someone else now
But he was Batman when he lived here
Maybe he's Yankee Zulu
Just waiting for the flood
And maybe Mac the Conqueror
With the severed head of love
I've seen him wearing aviators and a black baseball hat
Stalking airports 'cross the bardo quiet as a wildcat

The wheel is turning
From night into day
Everything's in transition
Everything must change
But none of us here
Will ever see the promised land
None of us here will be there for
Childhood's end
I see ya
You student debtors
In the watchtower overhead
Searchin' for headlights in the driveway
Crying "Dad, look what they did"
Just look
Even their romance made us masters and slaves
And now things keep getting worse while staying so eerily the same
Come build your burial grounds
On our burial grounds
But you won't kill death that way
I don't know bout you
But I'll take the love songs
And give you the future in exchange

I don't know 'bout you
But I'll take the love songs
If this century's here to stay
I don't know 'bout you
But I'll take the love songs
And the great distance that they came

[Verse 1]
Everybody's girl
What’s the point in bein' everybody's girl?
Maybe you think that way there’s no chance gettin' hurt
Livin' for no one costs me way more than it's worth

[Pre-Chorus]
So you're gonna be a singer, well, I'll be goddamned
You're as pretty as a post card, no thanks to the old man
It's the same coat I had on the night that I went in
I can stay an hour at Canter’s, the streets cool off by then
When can I see you again?

[Chorus]
Whatever happened to the girl I knew?
In the wasteland, come up short and end up on the news
Whatever happened to the girl I knew?
In the wasteland, come up short and end up on the news
Hey, hey hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Everything you want
What’s the fun in gettin' everything you want?
I wouldn’t know, but look, baby, you should try
Forget that lefty shit your mom drilled in your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Give the world a new savior, sell his pictures to the press
Buy a place out in the country, leave this world for someone else
My destruction is an hour late, I'm at Buddy's Rendezvous
Tellin' the losers and old timers how good I did with you
They almost believe me, too

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Lana Del Rey & Father John Misty]
Whatever happened to the girl I knew?
In the wasteland, come up short and end up on the news
Hey
Whatever happened to the girl I knew?
In the wasteland, come up short and end up on the news
Ah-ha, ah-ha
Whatever happened to the girl I knew?
In the wasteland, come up short and end up on the news
Yeah

[Outro: Lana Del Rey & Father John Misty]
Whatever happened?
Whatever happened?

[Verse 1]
Home alone, tryin' not to eat
Distract myself with pornography
I hate the way she looks at me
I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
I'm goin' back to therapy

[Chorus]
'Cause I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you

[Interlude]
(Want me to sing in here?)
(Okay)

[Verse 2]
I got a call from a girl I used to know
We were inseparable years ago
Thought we'd get along, but it wasn't so
And it's all I think about when I'm behind the wheel
I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
But nothing lasts, I know the deal

[Chorus]
But I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you

[Outro]
Can't get over you
No matter what I do
I know I should, but I could never hate you

[Intro]
All the nasty girls around the world
All the nasty girls around the world
Get nasty, uh, uh
Get nasty, uh

You can take me high, and then I’ll take you low
I don't need a car, where else we gotta to go
Somebody call the cops, a riots on the way
When we get to the club, I want you to say
Whеn we get to the club, somеbody better play

[Chorus]
Get nasty, uh, uh
Get nasty, uh
Get nasty, uh, uh

[Chorus 2]
Everybody's looking for a good time

[Breakdown]
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Just work it
Pump it (Ahh)
Now flip it (Ooh)
And freak it (Ahh)
Uhh, uhh! (Ow!)

[Bridge]
You can take me high, and then I'll take you low
I don't need a car, where else we gotta go

[Chorus]
I'm dancing on the floor, get down with me
I'm dancing on the floor, come ahh with me
Get nasty, uh, uh
Get nasty, uh
Get nasty, uh, uh
Get nasty, uh

[Outro]
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
All the nasty girls around the world
All the nasty girls around the world
All the nasty girls around the world
Around the world

[Verse 1]
Old man sittin' by the side of the road
With the lorries rolling by
Blue moon sinkin' from the weight of the load
And the buildings scrape the sky
Cold wind rippin' down the alley at dawn
And the mornin' paper flies
Dead man lying by the side of the road
With the daylight in his eyes

[Chorus]
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around

[Verse 2]
Blind man runnin' through the light of the night
With an answer in his hand
Come on down to the river of sight
And you can really understand
Red lights flashing through the window in the rain
Can you hear the sirens moan?
White cane lyin' in a gutter in the lane
If you're walking home alone

[Chorus]
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around

[Chorus]
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around

Beautiful, need to feel
I can't feel you
One night, so lovely

[Snippet 4]
You

[Snippet 5]
Party
Ooh

[Verse 1]
In my mind
And nailed into my heels
All the time
Killing what I feel

[Chorus]
And everything I touch
(All wrapped up in cotton wool)
(All wrapped up in sugar-coated pills)
Turns to stone
And everything I touch
(All wrapped up in cotton wool)
(All wrapped up in sugar-coated pills)
Turns to stone

[Verse 2]
I am fused
Just in case I blow out
I am glued
Just in case I crack out

[Chorus]
And everything I touch
Turns to stone
Everything I touch
(All wrapped up in cotton wool)
(All wrapped up and sugar-coated)
Turns to stone

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
You know what it is, don't overreact
I'm twenty-six, felonious past
Rolling with the pack, even when it switch
Guarantee you miss, don't get too attached
Heavy weight on my back
Chamberlain with the stats
Don't play with it, sailing the land
Niggas stay with the plan, we anchored in
When I get the thrax, I'm inhaling
I happen to know the assailant
I'm happy to throw off the trail
Cover your nose, it's surveillance
I know it's a quota to fill
Where you going and what's your intent?
I ain't notice the run of the mill
I ain't known for hugging the fence
Head hard, I'm stubborn as shit
Quick start, can't cover the steps
Inside likе my partner from 65th
Big love, but I'm from the mid
I'm coming homе, but love where he slid

[Outro]
And he is safe, well, he is superhuman
Wow, overturned call, what a slide

[Intro]
Mm-mm, mm-mm, uh

[Verse]
Strong spirit where the body couldn't get asylum
The cost of living high, don't cross the picket line and get the virus
Wild cat has got 'em in a bind, stay inside
Know I came from out the thicket smilin'
Mad hatters cappin' every line
It doesn't matter to the ten of five
They start hackin' when they can't shrink us
I found the middle in a bit of balance
Fever in the cabin
I knew where we was headed
I ain't countin' no blessings, I sure as shit could measurе
Blinkin' for some feasible mеthods to free yourself
Split it with my hand like cigarill's
Slick oil in a fish' gill
I fill a void with the pen, feel the fear, shrill
Couple stains that I couldn't shield
My brother, Brain, that we couldn't shield
Couple came, couple went still
And what remain of the wolves, nil
I held the page, gave the book ears
Whispered "Thanks", hella pain, heavy rain in the Catskills
Played the shade, quite a deal, glad we stayed friends

[Intro]
And I'll give you a kiss
Ugh, some, yeah
Yes sir, somethin' gotta give

[Verse]
Somethin' gotta give, spin another web
Head home, mess with Fisk, like I'm Spider-Man
Felt it on a whim
You'll fall and slip again, I heard life a trip (What a trip)
Get it how you live (Yeah), I guess it's all you get (Get)
Take it on the chin (Chin), ugh (Ugh)
Pleasure by the gram
Gas siphonin', smoke in my diaphragm (Diaphragm)
Stem caps, molly, black Betty, bam-ba-lam
They be out there, shorty really from the West
Just an alley cat, legend in the fucking flesh
Quit the frat, double back, I need a percent
Blast and laugh, karma, facts, that's a messy bitch
Can't go out sad, can't go outside no more, 'cause niggas sick, ayy
Fuck a second chance, I won't let the devil in
Somethin' gotta give, cover me, I'm going in, ugh
Pressure blow the lid, factor in the overhead
Live with no regrets, tell 'em when to tote a fif' (Yeah)
I could count the chips, not on what the teller said
That's expensive shit, like my Uncle Fela said
Cover me, I'm going in

[Outro: Fela Kuti]
So really, art is what is happening at a particular time of a people's development or underdevelopment, you see. So I think, as far as Africa is concerned, music cannot be for enjoyment, music has to be for revolution. Really working with the people, enlightening the people and doing your duty as a citizen to play music and act and do something about the system. If you feel bad about it, do something about it

[Intro]
It would be simple, wouldn't it?
My father was away trapping
Watch lives
What happened to you?
Magic
What's magic?

[Verse 1: Zelooperz]
Out with the vision myself
I had to fend for myself
I get the green like it's kelp
I put that shit in the pail
Make sure my momma do well
All of my bitches do well
All of my bitches do well
My bitches shine like jew-els
I get that cash through the wire
I make 'em plays on the cell
I free my sister out cell
I got that check through the mail
Jupiter, jumbo, or giant
Whippin' that paint, jambalaya
I held your ho with a spell
I put that bitch on the trail
Hopе I be smoking the finest
Running thе game like a tyrant
Winter when nothing else fails
Winter still bringing you hell
Simply sin for me, bitch, sing a symphony
Bitch just defending me, she thought that this was skin-deep
Been took your bag, been told you that you been weak
Been had the mag, been on the line, assembly
Tragedy in the street
Lookin' for someone to laugh with me, incomplete
Lookin' for someone to match with me, Desert Eagle
Lookin' for someone that blast for me, Desert Eagle
Lookin' for someone to fly with me, get high with me, no Visine
Just see what my eyes see, open my eyes, free me
Just remind me where I'm from and what's going on
What's happening? The gas going, the motor flowing
Bitch, what's happening? Remind me where I'm from
And what's happening? The motor going, the gas flowing
Bitch, what's happening?

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I did some dirt with the clique
Went and got cliqued by myself
Couldn't belittle myself
Couldn't be all weak-as-hell (Hell)
I just be weary of self (Self)
I had to fend for myself (I had to fend for myself)
Had to get low like the jail pose
Check rear-view, then lose the tail, bro (Check rear-view, then lose the tail)
I'ma skip over the hellhole
I had the vision myself
They clouded me at a standstill
I picked up a penny and left (Penny and left)
I picked up the clip (With a step) with a step
Singular current event, everything we in the midst of
How long you waiving the rent? (Ugh)
Moratorium extendo, I'm just evading the pit
Ain't no parade in the tent (Tent)
Fuck out my face with syringe
Fixing my face, feigning interest
'Lone, all my patience get thin (Everything takes patience)
Everything he say, I missed it
Can't believe you get paid for this shit (Whatever stock up the shelves)
Whatever stock up the shelves
Niggas thinking that they figured it out
Hit the lab, whip up a cell
They itching for it, I seen it's been a drought
I hear the toll of the bell, tried to atone with a prayer (Prayer)
Know the toll never tell (Tell)
You gon' see when you get there, and he out, ugh

[Outro]
I would do anything to make my children happy
Please, black girl, is there anything you can do to help me?
Maybe there is... (Magic)
How can I make our Black children happy without any magic?
It depends upon what you tell them
Magic is only make-believe and our children do not need to grow up in a make-believe world. You need to tell them the truth and help make them feel proud of who they are. The magic of truth is much more powerful than magic of make-believe
But what can I tell them?
Tell them that they're beautiful. Tell them that they're Black
Here, take hold of my wing, and I will take you to someone who can give you something even better than magic

[Intro]
Yep, yep, yep

[Verse]
Same one that I forgot to praise still above me
One thing about it, I'ma beat 'em to the punches
Stumped all day, thinkin', "Mama, where the love went?"
With every triplet of trips around the sun, some of the sludge get thicker
I'm chippin' away at crust
Hold your head, your shit is in for a whole 'nother bust
Roamin' the citadel, on foot eleven when the spliff gave me a rush
Play in the cuts like a DJ
Let me know if you wanna tangle with some
Lemon meringue, Wallabees sole stained gum
Explorin' a couple different avenues and stayin' dangerous, day drunk, yeah
Sometimes the pain sit and fester into hate, beloved
I'm workin' on it
It's worth the time
Further down the line
Might realize
What's yours obviously mine
Toss the sword back into the vines
Callin' out for Lord, lookin' low and high
Finally found it at the core of my dimming fire
What's a little lie? What's a little lie?
Tell 'em

[Outro]
Gotta make it straight
Fill the jar, it's hot
The longer you can stand it, the straighter it's gon' be
I gritted my teeth, my eyes watered, my nose was runnin'
I couldn't stand it any longer
Then my head caught fire

[Verse]
The same dust can't stay, I gotta clean or I can't think
Resort to cantankerous means on the cash play, rat races
The cheese sit in the trap, wait
It snap, then we break
Somethin' reachin' for me from the waist
These days, I'm mindful of what I embrace
Operating on an empty tank, spank me, fumes fueling a flame
My grandfather spoke thirteen languages
Somehow never had nothing to say to Boot Raymond
Sensed hazel, made sense of it through prayer
Booze is a fool's fragrance
Ipeleng, the glue that saved us
Through his brain getting chipped away at daily
His body on a road, where his mind flailing, funeral wailings
No beluga, no Bob, just mood swingin'
True pain, I couldn't eat or sleep for seven days
Maimed me, I ain't weak
Keep changing for the better, what to do when your job thankless
In the middle of the marsh where mosquitoes chomp ankles
Swamp marching on on the quest for my lost halo, God (Lost halo, God)

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Blood seepin')
Blood, blood, blood, blood

[Chorus]
Seeping into the mulch, I needed a quick result
I read it and don't respond
She see it and salt sprinkle
I needed another go
I'm seeing her when I want

[Verse]
Fire leaping out the hole
Deep breathing only make it grow
Ain't wanna leave the clutch (Clutch)
Far be it for me to plead with y'all
Hit, leanin' into the crutch
Speedin' through the lulls
Take heed, we took an oath to the sword
The shield took a couple chinks but it never broke
I know what he mean, how I play it based on what I'm shown
Consolidate the cream, then I'm headed home
She ain't shine like fourteen karat gold, rewiring
Patchin' holes
It's no rewinding, for the umpteenth time, it's only forward
Peace to AKAI SOLO, the soldier
I couldn't toast a drink to demise, I heard the clink
Life could change in the blink of an eye, I'm wrinklin' time
I'ma leave it to y'all to get hoodwinked and surprised
Threw on some Bootsy, I rather be with you when I'm high
I went ahead and mixed some Beetle Juice with the wine
Skin contact, peeling her eyes, squeeze down
It's been a minute since I blew up your line
I leave town fast
Out the dungeon like Outkast
Funnels with the loud pack
Hunter's boots crunchin' through the brown grass

[Chorus]
Blood
Blood seeping into the mulch, I needed a quick result
I read it and don't respond
She see it and sprinkle salt
I needed another go
I'm seeing her when I want
Uh
Uh
Uh
Ayo
This song is dedicated to all the happy people
这首歌，给所有幸福快乐的人们
All the happy people who have real nice lives
给那些生活精彩美满
And have no idea what it's like to be broke as fuck
不知道穷困潦倒是什么滋味儿的人

I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net
我觉得自己仿佛置身钢丝之上，随时会跌入万丈深渊
Poppin' Percocet I'm a nervous wreck
依靠止痛片缓解精神痛苦
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check
我值得别人尊重，但却为了每小时5.5美元累得满头大汗
I'm about to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt
我真想靠持枪抢劫来改变这个局面
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged, full of venom and rage
最低工资让我满怀恶意怒火，却无从发泄
Especially when I'm engaged
尤其是我深陷这般困境
And my daughter's down to her last diaper
而且Hailie的尿不湿就剩一片了
It's got my ass hyper
我开始急躁亢奋，焦头烂额
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
我向上帝祈祷答案，可能我得更加虔诚
Watchin' ballers while they're flossin' in their Pathfinders
看着名流人士坐在豪车里剔牙
These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers
看着一夜成名的人给粉丝签名
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
每个人都希望成功
Along with the small fries and average half-pinters
把食不果腹，饮不止渴的不堪过往抛在身后
But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas
眼红别人成功的人像女人一样满腹牢骚
'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
看过钞票的双眼再也容不下他物
Money'll brainwash you and leave yo' ass mindless
金钱会把你洗脑，让你丢掉自己
Them snakes slither in the grass spineless
身边虚心假意的人个个阴险狡诈

That's rock bottom
人生低谷
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
生活逼得你想行凶泄愤
That's rock bottom
人生低谷
When you want somethin' bad enough to steal
为迫切想要的东西甘愿偷窃
That's rock bottom
人生低谷
When you feel like you've had it up to here
你觉得到此境地已是忍耐的极限
'Cause you mad enough to scream
想要疯狂地大喊发泄
But you sad enough to tear
却只能流出伤心的泪水

My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
我的人生满是空洞的诺言和破碎的梦想
I'm hopin' things look up
我一直祈祷着转机出现
But there ain't no job openings
可我连一份正经工作都没有
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
饥肠辘辘，营养不良，灰心丧气
Livin' in this house with no furnace unfurnished
蜗居在没有火炉和家具的破房子里
And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay
我受够了没有前途的工作和微薄的薪水
And I'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day
也厌倦了被雇用的那一天又被解雇
But fuck it
去他妈的
If you know the rules to the game,play
如果你知道游戏的规则，尽管放手一搏吧
'Cause when we die, we know we all goin' the same way
死后每个人都不再有高低贵贱之分
'Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
当你和出人头地取得成功差的
When all you need is bucks to be the man
只是钱和豪车这样的物质条件时，请记住
Plus a luxury sedan or comfortable and roomy in a 6
拼搏斗争很酷，逆来顺受很糟
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
人们把我和那些忧郁的疯子划为一类
Who walk around depressed and smoke a pound of cess a day
他们整天垂头丧气地游荡，烟不离手
And yesterday went by so quick
昨日飞逝如此之快
It seems like it was just today
仿佛我直接跳过昨天来到了今天
My daughter wants to throw the ball
Hailie想和我玩球
But I'm too stressed to play
我却累得抬不起胳膊
Live half my life and throw the rest away
挨过前半生，丢掉后半生

That's rock bottom
人生低谷

There's people that love me and people that hate me
有人支持我，也有人厌恶我
But it's the evil that made me, this backstabbin' deceitful and Shady
是魔鬼造就了我，这个背信弃义，满嘴谎言的Shady
I want the money the women the fortune and fame
我渴望金钱，美色，好运和名望
That means I'll end up burnin' in Hell scorchin' in flames
那意味着我最后会被打入地狱，经受业火灼烧
That means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name
那意味着我会偷走你的支票簿，伪造你的签名
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
我愿用来世饱受折磨换取今生幸福欢乐
'Cause right now I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom
眼下我觉得自己跌入了谷底
I've got problems
正如与我同住一个街区里的人那样
Now everybody on my block's got 'em
我也遇见了难题
I'm screamin' like them two cops when 2Pac shot 'em，
我像被2Pac射击的警察那样尖叫
Holdin' two Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em
手握两把Glock，但愿你家有新换的门锁能挡住我
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em
我女儿还缺一对袜子和一双鞋
And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em
而你手上的戒指好像镶上了几颗钻石
And while you flaunt 'em
这些东西你拿来在人前炫耀
I could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em
我却想抢走它们去当掉换钱
"I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch, you want 'em"
"我有一些戒指和一个崭新的手表，你想要吗？"
'Cause I ain't never went gold off one song
我没有一首歌能卖到白金认证
I'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn
赌上一切，拔枪闯入别人的家园


That's rock bottom
人生低谷
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
生活逼得你想行凶泄愤
That's rock bottom
人生低谷
When you want somethin' bad enough to steal
为迫切想要的东西甘愿偷窃
That's rock bottom
人生低谷
When you feel like you've had it up to here
你觉得到此境地已是你忍耐的极限
'Cause you mad enough to scream
想要疯狂地大喊发泄
But you sad enough to tear
却只能流出伤心的泪水

That's rock bottom
人生低谷
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
生活逼得你想行凶泄愤
That's rock bottom
人生低谷
When you want somethin' bad enough to steal

你觉得到此境地已是你忍耐的极限
'Cause you mad enough to scream

But you sad enough to tear

That's rock bottom
这就是人生低谷啊

[Intro: Buck Meek]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1: Adrianne Lenker]
It's a little bit magic
Like a river of mornin' geese
In the new warm mountain
Where the stone face forms and speaks

[Pre-Chorus: Adrianne Lenker]
I believe in you
Even when you need to
Recoil

[Verse 2: Adrianne Lenker]
When the topsoil
Is kicking up into the storm
And the dust goes dancing, na-na
And a billion planets are born

[Pre-Chorus: Adrianne Lenker]
I believe in you
Even when you need to
Recoil
Ooo

[Chorus: Buck Meek]
Just like that
The moon goes flat
Big lights in the city shine
Crying out
Take me to the limits of your love

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Adrianne Lenker & Buck Meek]
Therе's a dragon in the phone line
Coughing up a mighty flamе
With a tongue of silver (Silver)
Calling out my oldest name

[Pre-Chorus: Adrianne Lenker]
She says, "Hey, you
Do you remember me too?"
We were coiling
Ooo

[Chorus: Buck Meek]
Just like that
The moon goes flat
Big lights in the city shine
Crying out
Take me to the limits of your love

[Instrumental Break]

Same old words
I can hear the birds talk to me through them
I can hear the birds talk to me through them
Light is light, is light, is light, is light
Light is light, is light, is light

[Verse 2]
I wait
I can see her looking at me sideways
Headlight, headlight, headlight, headlight, headlight (Ooh)
Headlight, headlight, headlight, headlight

[Verse 3]
I visit the waterfall, early spring
Ring rises high forewarning
Light is light, is light, coyotes roaming
Look who's laughing now
Look who's laughing now

[Verse 4]
Wind in my hands, wind in my wings
"May I have this dance?" she sings
True romance
Light is light, is light, is light, is light

[Verse 1]
Back into the funhouse
Music is sublime
You see the lady spinning
She'll show me

[Verse 2]
We all lie in the funhouse
No one is your friend
No one loves a loser
We love you

Nobody calls
Fall into pieces
Don't be afraid
Life isn't easy
Sunshine to rain
Counting the windows

But nobody calls
Nobody calls
Sunshine to rain
Smile for the camera
But nobody phones
Nobody phones
Anyone
At all
Not at all
Not at all
Not at all

Nobody phones
Anyone

Nobody phones

Nobody phones
Anyone

Lyrics From Snippet:

[Verse 1]
She only smokes late at night
When the owls howl and the bat's in flight
Wipin' down tables and chairs
Savin' up for the airplane fare

[Chorus]
Say that anything goes
And if anything goes then
Maybe I'll go with you
If there is a way out
Where it is sunny up north
And it's sunny up north

[Verse 2]
We can dress up our friend
And go out spinning with everyone
Susan had a lot to say
'Bout the rude boys that she slept there with

[Chorus]
Say that anything goes
And if anything goes and then
Maybe I'll go with you
If there is a way out
Where it is sunny up north
And it's sunny up north

And when you leave, sometimes I
As you open your mouth
And you ...

[Verse 1]
Sometimes my life is like an ocean
And I feel like I'm just going through the motions, uh
My head is racing down a highway
I don't know where I'm going, but it's my way

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when I stop trippin'
Thinking 'bout what I'm missing
I feel so good I might just say it again
Just wanna stop trippin'
Thinking 'bout what I'm missing
I feel so good I might just, I might just, I might just

[Chorus]
Sing off key
Dance with two left feet
Won't let nobody
Take my happy from me
Not a care in the air
When you're doin' that there
To the kick, kick, snare
It's good vibrations

[Post-Chorus]
Da, da
Da, da, da
Da, da
It's good vibrations

[Verse 2]
I feel so breezy when I'm coastin'
When I want to get away from my emotions
I live my life like no one's watching
Find myself in a world I felt so lost in

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when I stop trippin'
Thinking 'bout what I'm missing
I feel so good I might just say it again
Just wanna stop trippin'
Thinking 'bout what I'm missing
I feel so good I might just, I might just, I might just

[Chorus]
Sing off key
Dance with two left feet
Won't let nobody
Take my happy from me
Not a care in the air
When you're doin' that there
To the kick, kick, snare
It's good vibrations

[Post-Chorus]
Da, da
Da, da, da
Da, da
It's good vibrations
Da, da
Da, da, da
Da, da
It's good vibrations

[Bridge]
Don't you take my tambourine
Don't you take my tambourine
But if you do, you better shake it (Jing a ling a ling)
You better shake it (Jing a ling a ling)
Don't you take my tambourine
Don't you take my tambourine
But if you do, you better shake it (Jing a ling a ling)
You better shake it (Jing a ling a ling)

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when I stop trippin'
Thinking 'bout what I'm missing
I feel so good I might just say it again
Just wanna stop trippin' (Stop)
Thinking 'bout what I'm missing
I feel so good I might just, I might just, I might just

[Chorus]
Sing off key (Sing off key)
Dance with two left feet
Won't let nobody
Take my happy from me
Not a care in the air
When you're doin' that there (doin' that there)
To the kick, kick, snare (Doin' that there)
It's good vibrations

[Post-Chorus]
Da, da
Da, da, da
Da, da
It's good vibrations
Da, da
Da, da, da
Da, da
It's good vibrations

[Outro]
You got that good, good vibe on
You got that good, good vibe, yeah (It's good vibrations)
You got that good, good vibe on
You got that good, good vibe, yeah (It's good vibrations)

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]

I'm sure he treated you right while I was gone
So you should tell him thank you
Before you send him home where you belong

Ain't nobody love you like I do (Like I do)

[Chorus: Talay Riley]
Like I do

[Bridge: Ne-Yo]
Does he make you feel like I made you feel?
There's a difference between
(Just feeling something than feeling something real)
Oh, why I just can't chill, 'cause the truth, is I love you still

[Verse 1: : Talay Riley & Ne-Yo, (Ne-Yo)]
Baby, I think of you
When I'm all alone and it's half past two (Half past two)
Bet you think about it too (Think about it too)
Ain't nobody love you like I do (Like I do)

[Outro: Brooks]

[Intro]
Yeah, Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And we spoke in past tense
Reminisce ‘bout back when
Our spirits used to dance with each other
We been smokin gas, yeah
This is so romantic
I never wanna press fast forward
You treat me like I’m more than a pair of skin and bones
And that really made a difference in my story
Life will take its toll
But whichever way we go
Know I’m right here by your side, shawty

[Chorus]
Skin and bones under the covers
Kept our love undercover
Nonchalant, very subtle
Tryin’ not to step on the puddle

[Verse]
Write on your flesh
With permanent ink
Light the incense
Remember this scent
High as a bitch
But you won’t catch me slip
I know nothing
I know I don’t

[Pre-Chorus]
And we spoke in past tense
Reminisce ‘bout back when
Our spirits used to dance with each other
We been smokin gas, yeah

And that really made a difference in my story
Life will take its toll
But whichever way we go
Know I’m right here by your side, shawty

[Chorus]
Skin and bones under the covers
Kept our love undercover
Nonchalant, very subtle
Tryin’ not to step on the puddle

[Bridge]
High on love
Gotta let you know
Hot enough, yeah
High, you’re so
Tryin’ not to step on the puddle

[Pre-Chorus]
Like I’m more than a pair of skin and bones
And that really made a difference in my story
Life will take its toll
But whichever way we go
Know I’m right here by your side, shawty

[Beat Switch]

[Outro]
Yeah, uh
What a contrast
My skin and bones against the color of your aura
On a Sunday
Walkin’ slow
While time was still runnin’
The moon’s favorite daughter
Light in the dark
And the waves in the water
If I can’t be brave
And let you walk away
Maybe next life you’ll be mine again
Maybe next life you’ll be mine again

Blow a kiss and told me pull up at Aces
Came through drippin' Margiela no laces
Champagne pourin' couple bands I wasted
Then she said she can't go home with me I'm messy
How she treat me like a customer
Don't she see me textin' her fuckin' wrong with her?
Still callin' her, sendin' me to voicemail
She curved me empty room at the hotel
That's what I get in the club tryna find love
My new chick pants fit like a small glove
King bitch gimme face with a rollie on
Now I know exactly what these girls be on

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
We ah sip that Henny for the day baby
Come my, my way baby

And if you let me love you, wait

And I know from the first time, the first time

Even though girl I know that I will fall for you

Let me come over, I know you know
When you dance, ooh ooh, I can really love

Verse 1 Lil B:
15, 16 started off a young man
Head in another place no Myspace
Older dudes run around with guns on they hip
Berkely California man I got love for that shit
Every day I stay awake cos I'm thinking when they coming
Old friends who grew up with
Really can't trust them
Man the cops is watching me
So you really can't bust him
Looking all through your еmails
Reading your discussions
What's to believе they talking about Illuminati
And the secret government that allegedly inside it
Man I'm sitting in my circle
Blowing blunts to the head
I'm just trying to live my life
And not in up jail or dead
Probation laws got me tripping all off the feds
All this was over funds and some motherfucking gas
While its people in the world who ain't got no fucking passion
I can see it in my rear-view
I'm finna break this glass

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I hear them calling me
Will I answer, answer
I see them chasing me
Will I run from them, run from them
I hear them calling me

Verse 2 Lil B:
I still so based
And people still in panic
What's going on
I just don't understand it
Some people fake
And some of them underhanded
Some underrated
Most of them stranded
I wish life had a guide and came with a pamphlet
To show me where to go
And the things that is tragic
Who really knows what you doing every day
And if you made the wrong moves that lead to your fate
And tell me about them asses
And how we eat in classes
The first time offenders
That's never given chances
And the people need justice
The one's living honest
We go ? man
And they ever take my life man
I give you the promise
I did it for the love
Never for the dollars
Stay based for life
And minimize the losses
I realize that I'm a living prophet
We are gods

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I hear them calling me
Will I answer, answer
I see them chasing me
Will I run from them, run from them
I hear them calling me

I see them chasing me
Will I run from them, run from them

[Verse 1]
Seeing the dress, seeing your face
Darken your inner self, we made our lives last longer
Hey, this is the best d**n thing in town
Money MIA, can't buy yourself new rings like the other girls
No prom, nothing for me
I always used to get so jealous of the girls at school
Now I don't have to

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at me now mama
I'm doing everything you wanted me too
I've got everything I wanted
Now I can go back

Let's play some hide and seek
I'll count to three
You can maybe make it out alive
Hurtful words are said
So ask them to play somе hide and seek

[Verse 2]
Practicing the piano might be confusing
Got my chеck for work
Don't have to brag, I have more than you
Used to have a lover but you took him from me

Look at me now mama
I'm doing everything you wanted me too
I've got everything I wanted
Now I can go back

She even has a new friend named Bella
Who has another friend named Ella
They can't get enough of each other
I will wait forever until they disappear evermore
Wait for the sun to come down
Wait for the dark to rise

[Outro]
Missing out on everything
Missing out on yourself
Devils will rise and they will get payback

[Verse 1]
Sitting around waiting for you all day long
Watching the clock go (tick, tick, tick)
You never even arrived at my palace
I'm still having the best time without you

[Refrain]
Even if I hear the words you speak
I have no idea what you mean
I'm the queen of America
You're the prince but if you're the prince
Then you shouldn't have been late

[Pre-Chorus]
I still hear your voice in the empty throne
I remember the first ring you gave me
But if you set me free finally
Which girl did you run away with?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm the queen of heartbreaks
You don't know what I have that can make you go away
It's the thought that counts for missing you
So if I'm correct then, you might be alone tonight
Even on a Saturday night

[Verse 2]
Watching our favorite movies
The same ones over and over again
We love horrors and classics
But if we love classics then we just did a classic movie
Remember when you left me

[Refrain]
Even if I hear the words you speak
I have no idea what you mean
I'm the queen of America
You're the prince but if you're the prince
Then you shouldn't have been late

[Pre-Chorus]
I still hear your voice in the empty throne
I remember the first ring you gave me
But if you set me free finally
Which girl did you run away with?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm the queen of heartbreaks
You don't know what I have that can make you go away
It's the thought that counts for missing you
So if I'm correct then, you might be alone tonight
Even on a Saturday Night

[Bridge]
You should've been lucky to be married to the queen of heartbreaks
Instead you wasted you're whole life
Count your money, you only get to live once
But you're just a cruel, selfish, prince
Or should I say cheater or monster or anything
Taking over everything
Don't take that stuff away from me
I've only just begun

[Outro]
Play me like a fool
I've known your trick forever
I lived like this forevermore

Welcome to the jungle

Feel the ground shake
I've been waiting for you
Up here in the wild
And there's nowhere, there's nowhere to hide

[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Sun comes up on this new morning
Shifting shadows, a songbird sings
And if these words could keep you happy
I'd do anything
And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder
With a tender touch you know so well
Somebody once said it's the soul that matters
Baby, who can really tell when two hearts belong so well

[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

[Verse 2]
Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in the cold night air
For this good love I'm receiving
I'd go anywhere, just as long as you were there

[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
When I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

[Bridge]
Oh, and on these quiet days
Where souls embrace so silently
Oh, the rain may wash away
All these words that young lovers say

[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will crumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I need you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

[Outro]
Say that you'll never go, that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
(That's for all time)
(That's for all time)
Say that you'll never go, that's for all time
Baby, you'll never go, that's for all time

[Verse 1]

[Verse 1: Harry Styles]
Walk in your rainbow paradise (paradise)
Strawberry lipstick state of mind (state of mind)
I get so lost inside your eyes
Would you believe it?

[Pre-Chorus: Harry Styles]
You don't have to say you love me
You don't have to say nothing
You don't have to say you're mine

[Chorus: Harry Styles]
Honey (ah)
I'd walk through fire for you ←
Just let me adore you←
Oh, honey (ah)
I'd walk through fire for you ←
Just let me adore you←
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do
Like it's the only thing I'll ever do

[Verse 2: Harry Styles]
You're wonder under summer skies (summer skies)
Brown skin and lemon over ice
Would you believe it?

[Pre-Chorus: Harry Styles]
You don't have to say you love me
I just wanna tell you somethin'
Lately you've been on my mind

[Chorus: Harry Styles]
Honey (ah)
I'd walk through fire for you ←
Just let me adore you←
Oh, honey (ah)
I'd walk through fire for you ←
Just let me adore you←

[Verse 1]
When I wake up
I do not read the paper
I stay in bed
And start my day off later
Always behind
I’m lost in my mind
Let the world pass me by with you by my side

[Chorus]
No news
No blues baby
I’m tuning it out
All this talk is way too loud lately
No news
No blues baby
I disconnect the line
Now I’m spending my time on you

[Verse 2]
On the front page
Did you see the headline
It’s not looking great
These might be the end times
Another new day
A new expose they say

[Chorus]
No news
No blues baby
I’m tuning it out
All this talk is way too loud lately
No news
No blues baby
Disconnect the line
Now I’m spending my time on you

[Sax Solo]

[Chorus]
No news
No blues baby
Tuning it out
All this talk is way too loud lately
No news
No blues baby
Disconnect the line
Now I’m spending my time on you

On you
On you

[Lyrics from snippet]
I always thought the way you talked was neat
And I dreamed that when you'd speak you'd speak to me, mm
But you're always out of reach
And I can't control my speech
And I'm scared that when we meet
I'll wanna touch you
I'll wanna touch you, ooh

[Lyrics from snippet]
Don't go there 'cause you'll never return
I know you think of me when you think of her
But then it don't make sense when you're trying hard
To do the right thing, but without

[Lyrics from snippet]
One shot is never enough
I just wait for us to go in circles
A lifetime of giving my all for you
(Hostile, give me a break)

[Verse 1]
It's weird how all of you guys are gone
It lasted for a day, I knew it
The moment I saw his face
I know we wouldn't be together, forever
I don't wanna make this all about me
But I heard something dirty

[Chorus]
And that's the words he said
Last time I met him the rain
I met him before I threw him away
Don't take back the words you said
It's funny you're future isn't in a magic ball yet

[Verse 2]
If you wanna find someone better than me, that's fine
I met the perfect guy in 1926
Wow, you havе just been a b*tch
I need more from your lies
Dig deeper and deepеr until I find you're heart

[Chorus]
And that's the words he said
Last time I met him in the rain
I met him before I threw him away
Don't take back the words you said
It's funny you're future isn't in a magic ball yet

[Bridge]
I swear I met somebody different
Somebody who cares
Someone who loves me
Someone who isn't cruel
Someone that makes me laugh
Well, none of those things are you
And I'd come crashing down
And you'd just sit there alone
While I'll run off by myself
It's the only thing that keeps me alive
That phone call you made to me
I missed it too but leave you behind

[Outro]
The magic ball isn't broken
It just doesn't tell pretty lies

[Verse 1]

Jam, jam, here comes the man
Hot damn, the big boy stands with an upper hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal, that's the man cause Mike's so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle
Bum rushed the door, 3 and 4's in a bundle
Execute the plan, first I cooled it like a fan
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael
Cause it aren't too hard to

[Intro: Jhené Aiko & Lil Wayne]
Baby, last time calling me baby (Ain't no woman like the one I got!
But she be always worrying about the one I got!)
Last time calling me crazy, crazy, crazy (Ain't no woman like the one I got! The one I got! The one I got!)
Baby, last time calling me baby (Ain't no woman like the one I got!
But she be always worrying about the one I got!)
Last time calling me crazy, crazy, crazy (Ain't no woman like the one I got! The one I got! The one I got!)

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart (Ted Smooth, straight face, you remember!)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Girl, don't believe them hoes
'Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Mwah, I french kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, "Ain't no woman like the one I got!"
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that'd make me a one-eyed fuck
I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped
But players fuck up, my bad
And just to keep from crying, I laughed

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko, Lil Wayne, Big Sean, Jhené Aiko & Lil Wayne, (Jaz The Rapper)]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart (Tunechi)
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start (Damn) (Jaz!)
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart (Brooklyn!)

[Verse 2: Jaz The Rapper]
Let me talk to these niggas!
How could I be so stupid?
Nah!
How could you be so stupid?
These hoes liked your money
I loved you and I proved it
Shit was like a movie not the ones Tom Cruising
Nigga you kept playin' me the bad things you looted it
Over and over this shit was the worse
Was the breakup worth me findin' lipstick on your shirt?
Or them condoms in your wallet sinked deep in them skirts?
Who you welcome home to nigga?
Shit gonna hurt
I'ma go back to I won't name drop
Boy you don't care, you movin' on, when will the game stop?
You sayin' that you good
But I think not
This cupid shot me and you in the same spot
I gave you all the Jaz but ain't enough huh
And I know you say you bad cause players fuck up
Since you gambled with my love and prayers what's up

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart (Sean!)
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Interlude: Big Sean]
Okay, skeet, smoke, sleep, call, miss, text, woke, spoke
Lie, feel, Lisa, ew, time, kill, months, still

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I got somebody baby mama calling me daddy (Yup)
I drank too much, please call me a cabby (Swerve)
Penthouse afterparty, hoes want the addy (Swerve)
Fuck, they can ride with us, crawl in the Caddy
Third row, that's when you call, I hit cancel
Really, I hit answer, fuck, I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screaming 'til my phone died
Then she text me like, "Why you still talk to my mama?
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo? Man, fuck this tattoo
You the reason I wasn't single in college
What, all because I had you?
Nigga, I don't even have you
How I'm supposed to get past you?"
Then she called the next guy, spillin' some real shit
Now they problems that he got to deal with

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Outro: Jhené Aiko & Lil Wayne]
Baby, last time calling me baby (Ain't no woman like the one I got!
But she be always worrying about the one I got!)
Last time calling me crazy, crazy, crazy (Ain't no woman like the one I got! The one I got! The one I got!)
Baby, last time calling me baby (Ain't no woman like the one I got!
But she be always worrying about the one I got!)
Last time calling me crazy, crazy, crazy (Ain't no woman like the one I got! The one I got! The one I got!)
(Ain't no woman like the one I got!
But she be always worrying about the one I got!)
(Ain't no woman like the one I got! The one I got! The one I got!)
(Ain't no woman like the one I got!
But she be always worrying about the one I got!)
(Ain't no woman like the one I got! The one I got! The one I got!)

Glashrs who is fresh in the game has released his new song Crazy on September 24, 2021. He collaborated with his twin sister Cory DeMario on this new amazing Pop/EDM track. Crazy already made a mark on his fans. Crazy is a mixture of a catchy pop rhythm with an energetic, and “crazy” drop that’s perfect to dance to in all sorts of different functions. Crazy lyrics represent the feeling of just starting off college days, where partying is a normal thing, and the night plays a big role in not only having fun but growing up in a way. Glashrs and his sister both graduated from Vero Beach High School in 2020 during the hype of Pandemic Covid 19, so there wasn’t much of anything to do. Now everything comes back to normal, now is the time to enjoy this song, and well go for “Crazy”
This is the first time that Glashrs is releasing his song with his sister on his own platform. Glashrs is producing and co-writing her original tracks for the past 2 years, it’s exciting to see two talented siblings taking in the music industry at the same time, but on their own as well. This isn't the first time they've worked together, and it won't be the last. Everyone is excited to see what they both offer to their fans in the future. Glashrs wrote this song while n his car and stated “the lyrics came easy to me that’s how I think a great song is made, when it feels simple, and it just comes to you stuck with it... although the mix was a bear, but I figured it out eventually” Cory killed the vocals as always she’s a great singer, and knew how I wanted it to sound, I’m very happy with how it turned out!
What Instruments and Melodies are Used in This Song?
Like most of Glashrs’s songs, “Crazy” catchy melody has also written on a grand piano which he then transfers over to his DAW and uses special synthesizers to get a unique sound, and experiments with the production, and brings the whole song to life. Check out its amazing lyrics below!
Back then we been trippin bout that old shit
Times changed now I’m feeling kinda ruthless
I don’t know why I’ve been changing my mind lately
Mhmm
Pour up then we hop inside a spaceship
Go off like we live inside the matrix
Damn right now it’s time to go fucking crazy
Mhmm
Ridin down slow with the top down
Subs blastin hear the rumble through the whole town
Livin it up and we don’t give a fuck baby
Who needs sleep when we livin like this and we livin like that, so don’t call me right back yeah yeah
Got a thing for the champagne, the buzz got me going crazy
Woah woah woah we been going hard all night
We can’t seem to stop even when we see the sunrise
Damn right we been going so fucking crazy
Yea

I'm here, like, for one night
So we don't gotta waste time
I know that you feel it
My hands upon your waistline
So won't you, come closer
Let me know you're all mine (let me know)
Let me know you're all mine (let go)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I might stay tonight
But not for long
And I might say goodbye
Right now, yeah baby, right now

Introduction

A capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy in an electric field. The effect of a capacitor is known as Capacitance. A capacitor has terminals connected to two metal plates separated by a non-conducting material. Also, the capacitor passes alternating current rather than direct current





Advantages of Falcon Capacitors


Energy Storage- A capacitor is a passive electronic component that tends to store, filter, and regulate electrical energy. A capacitor also has the property of conducting alternating current and blocking voltage levels of direct current



Simple Operating Principle- The simple and effective operating principle of a capacitor is that it has two parallel metallic plates, which are separated by a dielectric material, which is non-conductive. Positive and negative charges get collected on separate plates. The plate on which the electron gets collected develops a negative charge. Whereas a positive charge is developed on the other plate. Now both the plates try to come closer to each other because of the opposite charges, but the dielectric material keeps them separate. Therefore, an electric field is created, and the capacitor stores the charge



Charging And Discharging- The capacitor has the tendency to get charged within seconds and also get discharged quickly. Also, capacitors can hold their charge for a long period of time without large residual decay


Types And Sizes- The operating voltage and the number of load capacitors can decide the physical size of the capacitors. Capacitors are available in various sizes and shapes. Their size and shape also depend on the construction material used. A few commonly used types of capacitors are ceramic capacitors, film capacitors, electrolytic capacitors, super capacitors, and variable capacitors



Identification- The operating voltage and the number of load capacitors that can store are the two factors that can make consumers have a choice in types of capacitors. In some of the capacitors, working value is already written over it, whereas in some capacitors, numbers and colours are used to denote them



Power Factor- Capacitors tend to compensate for the reactive power consumption of electric motors and transformers after producing reactive power. These results are seen as stable power grids along with increased transmission capacity



Safety- The smaller the capacitor, the safer it is. Since it doesn't have mixtures of highly flammable liquids, capacitors have the property to resist overheating during heavy charges or discharges



Long Life- The maintenance-free capacitors can operate for around ten years without any service. Usually, capacitors are cheaper as compared to other electronic types of equipment



Application Areas- There are various types of capacitors with different functions-


In DC blocking, a capacitor blocks the passage of direct current and allows the alternate current to pass



Filter- Different types of filters are used in electronic circuits, of which capacitors are the main component



Capacitors are used as charge units and discharge units for triggering, ignition, and as a power source



The capacitor has the property of passing an AC signal and allowing it a couple of sections of an electronic circuit to another circuit

(Ooh, Bobby raps and makes beats)
I haven't slept alone in a minute
Like to push my own limits

[Verse 1: 2D]
I lost my leg like I lost my way
So no loose ends
Nothing to see me down
How are we gonna work this out?

[Verse 2: 2D]
Dreams are bad, our heads are mad
I love the girl
But God only knows it's
Getting hard to see the sun coming through
I love you
But what are we gonna do?

[Verse 3: 2D]
Picture I'm a dreamer
I'll take you deeper
Down to the sleepy glow
Time is a low
Don't you know?
What are we gonna do?

[Verse 4: 2D]
Cause all those throbbing pains
Put them in your pocket
But what do they mean to you?
I love you
But what are we gonna do?

I saw the fire in your eyes
You tell me things you wanna try (Uh)
You risk it all to feel alive, oh yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You said you do this all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like a dream what she feels with me
She loves to be on the edge
Her fantasy is okay with me
Then suddenly, baby says

[Chorus]
Take my breath away
And make it last forever, babe
Do it now or never, babe (Ah)
Take my breath away
Nobody does it better, babе
Bring me close to—

Want me to hold on to you tight
Want mе to hold on to you tight
Want me to hold on to you tight
You pull me closer, feel the heat between your thighs
You're way too young to end your life

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, it's like a dream what she feels with me
She loves to be on the edge
Her fantasy is okay with me
Then suddenly, baby says

[Chorus]
Take my breath (Take my breath a—, breath away)
Take my breath (Take my breath a—, breath away)
Nobody does it better, babe
Take my breath away (Ooh)

[Outro]
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)
You pull me closer, feel the heat between your thighs
Take my breath
Girl, I don't wanna be the one who pays the price
Take my breath

[Verse]
Say less, go on and give me all that audio
Money on my mind like Mario, but he's starry though
Starter jacket with the automatic from Sicario
Ferrari car key, it's my car versus your cardio
Nah, you ain't survivin' that scenario
I'll send 

[?]
Me and the Barrio is army ghost, you out of here, you adios
We as close as the ARIA and Bellagio

[?], but I will catch me a body, though
Contortionist chick, she really like to get naughty, bro
That's the nature, coins on my taper
In-N'-Out order ticket, it's mind on my paper
Or maybe on lock, like a hairnet
Aim a Berett' at your berets
Go together likе a hare and a carrot
Easy as Eric, tryna be in the air with an hеiress
That's gon' take a Lear Jet
So that's Jets meets F.F. Crew
That's Andretti and that’s Lu’
Man, that's like LSD meets LSU
That 

[?] is like two more fiends
I don't think the game can take two more kings
The streets'll rage from the Chi' down to Near Orleans
And they'll love it like two fourteens

Good evening ladies and gentlemen, err, welcome to The Half Beat. Tonight, we have for your entertainment, Joni Anderson. Joni's been appearing here for the last two weeks, and will be for the next three weeks. Starting next Monday we have her on a contract, we hope she won’t, err... We know she will stay here, we know you'll enjoy her as much as we have. Let's givе her a little bit of a welcomе now, Miss Joni Anderson

[Joni]
Thank you
It’s sure refreshing to have a mic to work with for a change, I've been playing through err, sort of an empty thing
The first song I'd like to do, tells about what happens when a man becomes so involved with almighty liquor, that he begins to think of it as a woman, and he calls his bottle, Nancy Whiskey

[Verse 1]
I am a weaver a Calton Weaver
I am a rash and a rovin' blade
I’ve got silver in my pooches
I'll gang follow the weaver's trade
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

[Verse 2]
Now I rolled into Glasgow City
Nancy Whisky I chanced to smell
I went in, sat doon beside her
Seven long years I loved her well
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

[Verse 3]
Now the more I kissed her the more I loved her
The more I kissed her the more she smiled
I set forth on my mother’s teachin'
Nancy soon had me beguiled
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

[Verse 4]
Now I rose early in the morning
To quench my thirst it was my need
I tried to rise but was not able
Nancy had me by the heid
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

[Verse 5]
Now I'm going back to the Calton weaving
I'll surely make those shuttles fly
I'll earn more at the Calton weavin
Than that I did in days gone by
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

[Verse 6]
Now come all you weavers, ye Calton Weavers
Come all you weavers where e're you be
Beware of Whisky, Nancy Whisky
She'll ruin you as she ruined me
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

[Outro]

In 1961, a man named Ewan MacColl wrote a song and entered it in a song contest in England, and it wasn't much of a surprise to anybody when it won. It, err, has very very dramatic lyrics, very dym- dynamic lyrics, and a beautiful melody. It's called 'Crow On The Cradle'
About a hundred years ago when marriages were pre-arranged, a lot of funny things happened... like, fourteen-year old boys being married off to twenty-four-year old girls and... this is a song about what happens when a girl of twenty-one, marries are man of seventy-one, haha, nothing

[Verse 1]
The sheep's in the meadow
The cow's in the corn
Now is the time for a child to be born
Reach for the moon
And laugh at the sun
If he's a boy he'll carry a gun
Sang the crow on the cradle

[Verse 2]
If it should be that this baby's a girl
Never you mind if her hair doesn't curl
Rings on her fingers
And bells on her toes
And a bomber above her wherever she goes
Sang the crow on the cradle

[Verse 3]
Rock-a-by-baby
The black and the white
Somebody's baby was born for a fight
Rock-a-by-baby
The white and the black
Somebody's baby is not coming back
Sang the crow on the cradle

[Verse 4]
Now you're Mami and Papi
They scrape and they save
For they build you a coffin and they dig you a grave
Hush-a-bye little one, never you weep
'Cause we've got a toy that can put you to sleep
Sang the crow on the cradle

[Verse 5]
Bring me a gun, and I'll shoot that bird dead
That's what your Mami and your Papi once said
Crow on the cradle, tell me what shall I do?
That is a thing I'll leave up to you
Sang the crow on the cradle
Sang the crow on the cradle

[Intro]
Well from Euan McColl we go to another favourite writer of mine. This time an American, his name: Woody Guthrie

[Verse 1]
It's a mighty hard row that my poor hands have hoed
My poor feet have traveled that long dusty road
Out of your Dust Bowls and Westward we rolled
Your deserts were hot and your mountains was cold

[Verse 2]
I've worked in your orchards of peaches and prunes
I've slept in the cold heat of the pale silver moon
On the edge of the city you'll see us and then
We come with the dust and we're gone with the wind

[Verse 3]
California, Arizona, I made all your crops
Now it's up North to Oregon to gather your hops
Dig the beets from the ground, pluck the grape from your vine
To set on your table that light sparkling wine

[Break]

[Verse 4]
Green pastures of plenty from dry desert ground
From the Grand Coulee Dam where the waters role down
Every state in this Union us migrants have been
We'll stay in this fight and we'll fight until we win

[Verse 5]
It's always we rambled, that river and I
All along your green valley, I'll work till I die
My land I'll defend with my life if it be
My pastures of plenty must always be free

[Intro]
Another old American song, this time traditional

[Verse 1]
Every night when the sun goes in
Every night when the sun goes in
Every night when the sun goes in
I hang down my head and mournful cry

[Verse 2]
True love, don't weep, true love, don't mourn
True love, don't weep or mourn for me
True love, don't weep or mourn for me
I'm going away to Marble town

[Verse 3]
‘Twas once my apron but it hung down low
‘Twas once my apron it hung down low
‘Twas once my apron it hung down low
You followed me through rain and snow

[Verse 4]
But it's now my apron, it's to my chin
It's now my apron, it's to my chin
It's now my apron, it's to my chin
You pass my door but you don’t come in

[Verse 5]
Wish to the Lord that my babe was born
And sitting on his daddy's knee
And me, poor girl, was dead and gone
Where the green grass is growing, growing over me

[Verse 6]
Every night when the sun goes in
Every night when the sun goes in
Every night when the sun goes in
I hang down my head and mournful cry
And mournful cry
And mournful cry
And mournful cry
I'd like to end my set on a little happier note. This is a Trinidadian song, a calypso. And if you have enough nerve, haha, I'd like you to join in on the chorus with me. The only thing you have to remember is "Woo-oo-oo, sail away", and that's all the lyrics there is. It's got a very very strange melody, so any strange harmony you can come up with is appreciated, okay?

[Verse 1]
A man would be a fool to spend all his money
And have to go to sea once more
Ah, but when them brown skin girls
Start callin' you honey
You'll be a sailin' from that shore

[Chorus]
Just a-singin'
Ooo, sail away
Ooo, sail away

[Verse 2]
When we hit Trinidad
Was there I met Marni
Don't you know we started drinkin' rum
Ah, but now I feel so bad
She took all my money
And now I sail with the mornin' sun

[Chorus]
Just a-singin'
Ooo, sail away
Ooo, sail away

[Verse 3]
Now all you sailor lads
Who want to go sportin'
Remark ye well what I do say
Don't you trust them brown skin girls
They'll be your misfortune
You'll be at sea till your dyin' day

[Chorus]
Just a-singin'
Ooo, sail away
Ooo, sail away
Once again now
Ooo, sail away
Ooo, sail away

[Outro]
I'll be back in about 25 minutes I guess

[Verse 1]
John Hardy was a fightin’ man
Carried a razor everyday
Well he killed a man in Mobile town
You ought to see my Johnny get away
Ought to see my Johnny get away

[Verse 2]
Now John Hardy was standin’ at the bar
So drunk he could not see
Along came a man with a warrant in his hand
Cryin’ Johnny boy why don’t you come with me
Johnny boy why don’t you come with me

[Chorus]
Well get away, get away
Poor John

[Verse 3]
Now John Hardy had a pretty little girl
Kept her dressed in blue
Saw her in the hangin’ crowd
Cryin’ Johnny boy I’ll be true to you
Johnny boy I’ll be true to you

[Verse 4]
Now I’ve been to the north and I've been to the south
Been this whole world 'round
Been to the east and I've been to the west
And this will bе my buryin' ground
This will be my buryin' ground

[Chorus]
Well get away
Poor John

[Verse 5]
Now I’vе been this wild world over
Yes, I’ve been this whole world 'round
I’ve been to the river
And I’ve been baptized
Take me to my buryin' grounds

[Chorus]
Well get away
Poor John
Get away
Poor John

[Intro]
This is a song that we can all join in on the chorus. It's called 'Dark as a Dungeon'

[Verse 1]
Come all you young fellers
So young and so fine
And seek not your fortune
In the dark dreary mine
It will form as a habit
And seep in your soul
'Til the stream of your blood
Runs as black as the coal

[Chorus]
Where it's dark as a dungeon
And damp as the dew
Where the dangers are double
And the pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls
And the sun never shines
Lord, it's a dark as a dungeon
Down in the mines

[Verse 2]
Now it's many a man
I've seen in my day
Who lived just to labor
His whole life away
Like a fiend for his dope
Or a drunkard his wine
A man must have lust
For the lure of the mine

[Chorus]
Where it's dark as a dungeon
And damp as the dew
Where the dangers are double
And the pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls
And the sun never shines
Lord, it's a dark as a dungeon
Way down in the mines

[Verse 3]
Now I hope when I'm gone
And the ages shall roll
My body will blacken
And turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door
Of my heavenly home
And pity the miner
Who's digging my bones

[Chorus]
Where it's dark as a dungeon
And damp as the dew
Where the dangers are double
And the pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls
And the sun never shines
Lord, it's a dark as a dungeon
Down in the mines

[Verse 1]
An old man came courting me, courting me, courting me
An old man came courting me, faldaro dee
Yes an old man came courting me
Feigned he would marry me
Maids while you're young never wed an old man

[Chorus]
For they've got no faloorum, faliddle falooru
Got no faloorum, faliddle dog dee
No they've got no ding doodle
It's all in their noodle
Maids while you're young never wed an old man

[Verse 2]
When that we went to the church, went to the church, went to the church
When that we wеnt to the church, faldaro dee
Yes, when that wе went to church
He left me in the lurch
Now maids while you're young never wed an old man

[Chorus]
For they've got no faloorum, faliddle faloorum
Got no faloorum, faliddle dog dee
No they've got no ding doodle
It's all in their noodle
Maids while you're young never wed an old man

[Verse 3]
Now when that we went to bed, went to bed, went to bed
When that we went to bed, faldaro dee
Yes when that we went to bed
He lay as if he were dead
Now maids while you're young never wed an old man

[Chorus]
For they've got no faloorum, faliddle faloorum
Got no faloorum, faliddle dog dee
No they've got no ding doodle
It's all in their noodle
Maids while you're young never wed an old man

[Verse 4]
But when that he went to sleep, went to sleep, went to sleep
When that he went to sleep, faldaro dee
Yes when that he went to sleep
Out of bed I did creep
Into the arms of a jolly young man, haha

[Chorus]
And he had his faloorum, faliddle faloorum
Had his faloorum, faliddle dog dee
Yes he had his ding doodle
It wasn't in his noodle
Now maids while you're young never wed an old man

[Intro]
This is a song that I enjoy doing, very much. It's an old Scottish thing called yarrow

[Verse]
There was a lady in the nor'
I ne're did see her mare o
She was courted by nine gentlemen
And a poor plowboy frae Yarrow
These nine sat drinking at the wine
Sat drinking wine in Yarrow
And they did 'cide bemongst themselves
To fight for her on Yarrow
Now she washed his face and she caned his hair
As she had done before o
She made him like the handsome lord
To fight for her on Yarrow
And he did fight them one a time
Yay he did fight most fairly
'Til from behind one false young man
Did pierce his heart most squarely
O father did I dreamed a dream
I know it does mean sorrow
I dreamed I pulled the heather and the rue
On the Dowie Dens of Yarrow
So she walked out on yon high, high hill
As she had done before o
And there she found her lover gone
Lyin' pale and cold on Yarrow
Now her hair it bein' three yards long
And the color, it was yellow
She wrapped it 'round his middle sae small
And she bore him down frae Yarrow
Soon nine they came to call on her
Cryin which one will she mare o
She said I'll not marry a one aye ye
For ye slew me love on Yarrow
And you left me to sing sorrow

[Verse 1]
The crops are all in, and the peaches are rotting
The oranges are pilled in the creosote dumps
They're flying us back to the Mexico border
To pay all our money to wade back again

[Chorus]
Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis amigos, Jesus y Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
No, all they will call you will be 'Deportee'

[Verse 2]
Now my father's own father, he waded that river
They took all the money he made in his lifе
Six-hundred miles to the Mеxico border
They chased us like rustlers, like outlaws, like thieves

[Chorus]
Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis amigos, Jesus y Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
No, all they will call you will be 'Deportee'

[Verse 3]
The sky-bird caught fire, over Los Gatos Canyon
A big ball of fire, it shook all the ground
Who are these friends, who are falling like dry leaves
The radio said they're just deportees

[Chorus]
Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis amigos, Jesus y Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
No, all they will call you will be 'Deportee'

[Verse 4]
But we died in your hills, and we died in your valleys
We died in your orchards, we died on your plains
We died on your deserts, we died in your treetops
Both sides of the river, we died just the same

[Chorus]
Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis amigos, Jesus y Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
No, all they will call you will be 'Deportee'

[Verse 1]
Oh, fare thee well I must be gone
And leave you for a while
Wherever I go, I will return
If I go
If I go ten thousand miles
If I go
If I go
If I go ten thousand miles

[Verse 2]
Oh, the crow that is so black my love
Would change his color white
If ever I'm false to the boy I love
Day, day would turn to night
Yes, the day
Oh, the day
Yes, the day would turn to night

[Verse 3]
Oh, the rivers never will run dry
Or the rocks melt with the sun
I'll never be false to the boy I love
Tell all, all these things be done
Tell all
No, tell all
Tell all these things be done

[Outro]
Fare thee well
Fare thee well
Fare thee well, my love

[Verse 1]
I haven't got a mansion
Nor have I any land
Not one single dollar
To crinkle in my hand

[Chorus]
But I can show you the morning, on a thousand hills
And kiss you, and give you seven daffodils

[Verse 2]
I haven't got a fortune
To buy you pretty things
But I can make you moonbeams
Into necklaces and rings

[Chorus]
But I can show you the morning, on a thousand hills
And kiss you, and give you seven daffodils

[Bridge]
Yes, seven pretty daffodils
Are shining in the sun
To light our way to evening
And when the day is done
I will give you kisses, three
And a crust of bread
And a pillow of piny boughs to rest your head

[Verse 3]
No I haven't got a mansion
Nor have I any land
Not one single dollar
To crinkle in my hands

[Chorus]
But I can show you the morning, on a thousand hills
And kiss you, and givе you seven daffodils
And kiss you, and give you sеven daffodils

Check my fit, check my phone, check my balance
Take my time with my women and my albums
Big pimping, it ain't on me, it's in me
They ask me what I'm pimping, ho, I told 'em the system
Commitment, precision, I stand on all my decisions
I'm going all my in with my bros like Nip and Blacc Sam
I treat it like a meet and greet how I meet my demands
But I'd rather show you results than to tell you the plan
We don't have a silver spoon, you gotta eat with your hands
I broke the economics down, it's all supply and demand
That's why all of my queens respect me more than they man
They might slap a pussy nigga with they own pimp hand

[Chorus: Big Sean]

Ayy, I'm pimping from Las Vegas to Miami
I told the bitch, "Don't ever lie to papi"
I read up on the ecstasy and roxies
I'm kicking like I'm Bruce Lee in karate
I told the bitch next time to bring her buddy
She sucked my dick and say it taste like fudgy
I make her sell her pussy for nothing
I bought me yellow diamonds like it's Tussin
I had to drop one-fifty in my mouth before I talk
I let 'em go air out niggas spots in the Track Hawk
I make her tie my tennis shoes and turn up for my dawg
I bought her Christian Loub' shoes and made her take a walk

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Pimp in, big pimp in me

I let go, you know you're the only
I know you're gonna hold me, I know you won't let go of me
When I let go
So, so free, some totally, some totally
So, so free, some told me, nobody owes me
You showed me, that were 

[?], low-key, high-key
Standing mighty, going hi-fi, no wifey
Something, I let go

[?] told me, and you told me
And you show the, lonely, lonely
For the lonely, and it's only for the lonely

[Verse 1]
We were two heartbeats away
From wedding rings and a pretty ballgown dress
At the church off 40 West
And we were talking 'bout our future on the steps
Of your daddy's screened in porch
That if I'd ask, you'd tell me, "yes"
Well, it only took a month or so to be someone you used to know
You didn't really have to go, but you did
And I've never been a somber soul
But part of me ain't here no more
And I've been tryna find him ever since

[Chorus]
So now I take my whiskey sour
Sittin' barside after hours
Thinkin' how can I get over if the love was never ours?
Hell, I know you got my message
All my X's and my O's
And it kills me by the hour
Now I take my whiskey sours alone

[Verse 2]
'Cause that one night under neon
Was the first time you ordered me one
And you told me that you loved me
But was it ever true?
'Cause your promises were empty
Now I'm drinkin' one too many
Drowning out the memory of you

[Chorus]
So now I take my whiskey sour
Sitting barside after hours
Thinking how can I get over if the love was never ours?
Hell, I know you got my message
All my X's and my O's
And it kills me by the hour
Now I take my whiskey sours

[Bridge]
And I don't know why I do it
It's supposed to help me through it
But it's harder when it always tastes like you
And every time I hit rock bottom
I don't know what I should do
Should I call you up again or should I settle for round two?

[Chorus]
And just take my whiskey sour
Sitting barside after hours
Thinking how can I get over if the love was never ours?
Hell, I know you got my message
All my X's and my O's
And it kills me by the hour
Now I take my whiskey sours alone

[Outro]
And it kills me by the hour
Now I take my whiskey sour alone
Wait a minute man
Hey check this out man (Tell it!)
It was this blind man right, it was this blind man right
He was feelin' his way down the street with this stick right?
Hey. He walked past this fish market, you know what I'm sayin' (Fish market?)
He stopped he took a deep breath he said:
"Woooo, good morning, ladies!"
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
You like that shit man? (That's pretty good!)
Hey man, I've got a gang of that shit, man
I'll tell you what, my man on the guitar
Hey, fool on the drum
Hey, everybody's crowding around the mic
I'll tell you all these motherfuckin' jokes I got
But first I'mma start off like this, hey help me sing it, homeboy
Said Colt 45 and two Zigzags
Baby, that's all we need
We can go to the park after dark
And smoke that tumbleweed
As the marijuana burn we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
So roll, roll, roll my joint
Pick out the seeds and stems
Feeling high as hell
Flyin' through Palmdale
Skatin on Dayton rims
So roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe De Ville
If my tapes and my CDs just don't sell, I bet my cabby will
Well it was just sundown in small white town
They call it Eastside Palmdale (Well.)
When the Afroman walked through the white land
Houses went up for sale (Sale)
Well, I was standing on the corner sellin' rap CDs
When I met a little girl named Jan (Jan)
I let her ride in my caddy
Because I didn't know her daddy was the leader of the Ku Klux Klan
We fucked on the bed
Fucked on the floor
Fucked so long I grew a fuckin' afro
Then I fucked to the left (left)
Fucked to the right (right)
She sucked my dick 'til the shit turned white
I thought to myself sheeba-sheeba
Got my ass lookin' like a zebra
I put on my clothes and I was on my way
Until her daddy pulled up in a Chevrolet
So I ran - I jumped out the back window
But her daddy he was waitin' with a two-by-four
Oh, he beat me to the left
He beat me to the right
The motherfucker whooped my ass all night
But I ain't mad at her prejudiced dad
That's the best damn pussy I ever had
Got a bag of weed and a bottle of wine
I'mma fuck that bitch just one more time
Colt 45 and two Zigzags
Baby, that's all we need
We can go to the park after dark
And smoke that tumbleweed
As the marijuana burn we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
So roll, roll, roll my joint
Pick out the seeds and stems
Feeling high as hell
Flyin' through Palmdale
Skatin on Dayton rims
So roll, roll, the '83 Cadillac Coupe De Ville
If my tapes and my CDs just don't sell, I bet my cabby will
I met this lady in Hollywood
She had green hair, but damn she looked good
I took her to my house because she was fine
But she whipped out a dick that was bigger than mine
I met this lady from Japan
Never made love with an African
I fucked her once, (once)
I fucked her twice (twice)
I ate that pussy like shrimp-fried rice
Don't be amazed at the stories I tell ya (tell ya)
I met a woman in the heart of Australia
Had a big butt and big titties too
So I hopped in her ass like a kangaroo
See I met this woman from Hawaii
Stuck it in her ass and she said 

[Aiee!]
Lips was breakfast, pussy was lunch
Then her titties busted open with Hawaiian Punch
I met Colonel Sanders' wife in the state of Kentucky
Said I brought some chicken if you just fuck me
I came in her mouth, it was a crisis
I gave her my secret blend of herbs and spices
Colt 45 and two Zigzags
Baby, that's all we need
We can go to the park after dark
And smoke that tumbleweed
And as the marijuana burn we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong (Hey wait a minute, man, check this out...)
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
I met Dolly Parton in Tennessee
Her titties were filled with Hennessy
That country music really drove me crazy
But I rode that ass and said "Yes, Miss Daisy!"
Met this lady in Oklahoma
Put that pussy in a coma
Met this lady in Michigan
I can't wait 'til I fuck that bitch again
Met a real black girl down in South Carolina
Fucked her until she turned into a white albina
Fucked this hooker in Iowa
I fucked her on credit, so I owe her
Fucked this girl down in Georgia
Came in her mouth, man I thought I told ya
Met this beautiful sexy hoe
She just ran across the border of Mexico
Fine young thing said her name's Maria
I wrapped her up just like a hot tortilla
I wanna get married but I can't afford it
I know I'm gonna cry when she get deported
Colt 45 and two Zigzags
Baby, that's all we need
We can go to the park after dark
And smoke that tumbleweed
And as the marijuana burn we can take our turn
Singin' them dirty rap songs
Stop and hit the bong like Cheech and Chong
(Hey wait a minute man, hey fuck that shit)
And sell tapes from here to Hong Kong
Have you ever went over a girls south to front
But the pussy just ain't no good (Say what?!?)
I mean you gettin' upset because you can't get her wet
Plus you in the wrong neighborhood
So you try to play it off and eat the pussy
But it take her so long to come (Say what?!?)
Then a dude walk in that's her big boyfriend
And he asks you where you from
So you wipe your mouth and you try to explain
You start talkin' real fast
But he already mad cause you fuckin' his wife
So he start beatin' on yo' ass
Now your clothes all muddy
Your nose all bloody
Your dick was hard but now its soft (What?)
You thought you had a girl to rock your world
Now you still gotta go jack off
Said Colt 45 and two Zigzags
Lyrics from Snippets

[Intro]
Girl you lookin' too amazing for me not to say something
The look that's on your face, you ain't gotta say nothin'
You're good enough to wait, we don't gotta rush, fuck it (Haha) Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
Don't need nobody else but you, you, you, you and I
She asked me where I'm tryna eat, I told her, "You decide"
Honestly baby, that's the last thing that's on my mind
'Cause all I'm thinking about is pussy and the dollar signs
True-true love
Cop the Range out the window of the dealership
She ain't impressed of daddy yacht that size, a cruise ship
If she could see where I come from, she'd know I'm new to this
She used to this

[Chorus]
When I look at you, you look at me
We know what it is, no need to speak
I guess it's love
I guess it's love
When I look at you

[Verse 2]
At first you wouldn't take me home, was you embarrassed of me?
Your parents said we wouldn't last, they were scared to love me
Shit if they only knew my past, they'd be scared-er of me
...

[Chorus]
When I look at you, you look at me
We know what it is, no need to speak
I guess it's love
I guess it's love
When I look at you

[Bridge]

[?], oh

[Chorus]
When I look at you, you look at me
We know what it is, no need to speak
I guess it's love
I guess it's love
When I look at you

[Verse 1]
All my days and nights are the same
Days turn into nights and weeks, unanswered needs
Must I live my life this way?
Always livin' for the moment to hold you again

[Pre-Chorus]
I get tired (I'm so in love with you)
Of living alone
I can't wait for this journey to end (I hope you missed me too)
To come back home

'Cause you've got me callin' (Callin')
Callin' (Callin')
Callin' out your name (I call your name)

[Verse 2]
I can't help feeling the way that I do
'Cause you're one of a kind, so rare and true
I know we gotta do what we gotta do
(I know wе gotta do what we gotta do, baby)
That don't make it any easiеr being from you

[Pre-Chorus]
I get tired (I'm so in love with you)
Of living alone (I'm so in love with you)
I can't wait for this journey to end (I hope you missed me too)
To come back home

[Bridge]
Oh

Baby, for always being there
(Of all the rest, I've got the best, ooh)
Nothing can compare
You're my refuge
When I need to escape
You're my, oh, my oasis
When I need a cool drink, oh
You are my life, you are my soul
You're everything in this world (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
And you've got me callin' (Callin')
Calling (Callin')
Callin' out your name (I call your name)
You got me callin'(Callin')
(Each day of my life, baby)
Callin' (Callin')

One more time
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
Long nights in your car, mornings in your arms
From five hour calls to nothing at all
I guess time's a sign, writing on the wall, ooh
Don't know where it all went wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
But if this is how it's got to be
I need someone to tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me

[Chorus]
What comes after love?
I wanna know there's something for me after us
I don't think my heart was made to break this much
Tell me there is happy ever after love
Tell mе there is happy evеr after us

[Verse 2]
I know you said that this was meant to be
Now these words are ancient history
At least I get to keep the memories, uh
Mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall
Will somebody catch me when I fall?
So then I'll keep on dancing on my own

[Pre-Chorus]
But if this is how it's got to be
I need someone to tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me

[Chorus]
What comes after love?
I wanna know there's something for me after us
I don't think my heart was made to break this much
Tell me there is happy ever after love
Tell me there is happy ever after us

I believe, I believe, I believe in love
Even if, even if it wasn't meant for us
I believe, I believe, I believe in love (I believe in love)
I just need someone to tell me

[Chorus]
What comes after love?
I wanna know there's something for me after us
I don't think my heart was made to break this much
Tell me there is happy ever after love
Tell me there is happy ever after us
What comes after love?
I wanna know there's something for me after us
I don't think my heart was made to break this much
Tell me there is happy ever after love
Tell me there is happy ever after us

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I tried so long
Every time I thought I found it, I was wrong
I swear I must've spent a thousand nights
Looking for somebody who could hold me tight
Until I realized

Don't know how I fell and don't know why, don't know why
And now I'll pick myself up one more time, one more time

We hide from the night 'til morning light, feels like forever

Right here by the light of the moon
Spotlight on you got me zooming
I'm falling into you

We're dancing on tabletops, neighbors calling the cops

Nobody's watching us

[Post-Chorus]
No, nobody's watching
So come touch my body
No, nobody's watching us

[Verse 2]
Mmm, there could be a million people
But my eyes are only locked on you (Yeah, yeah)

Putting on a show, that's what we do
And we don't sleep at night
Got adrenaline going through the bloodstream
Don't sleep at night, no, no (Nah, nah)

I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Oh, baby, it might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious

'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Ooh, baby, baby

Oops, I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love

You see, my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist
I cry watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways?

But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh, baby, oh

Oops, I did it again

Sun comes up on this new morning
Shifting shadows, the songbird sings
And if these words could keep you happy
I'll do anything
And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder
With a tender touch you would know so well
Somebody once said it's the soul that matters
Baby, who can really tell when two hearts belong so well

[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

[Verse 2]
Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in the cold night air
Once good love, 

[?] seen it
I'd go anywhere, just as long as you were there

[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
When I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

[Bridge]
Oh, and on these quiet days
Where souls embrace so silently
Oh, the rain may wash away
All these words that young lovers say

[Chorus]
And maybe the walls will crumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I need you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

[Outro]
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
You 

[?]
(That's for all time)

[?]
(That's for all time)
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you'll never go, that's for all time

[Intro: The Temptations]
Listen to what this brother has to say

[Verse 1: K. Sparks and The Temptations]
The world need change, the world need peace
Seen a lot of things just going on all up in the streets
Police all up in the streets while the people want justice (Uh)
They say sometimes you gotta stand alone, so it's just us
Y'all want some change for change, they'll be collateral
Temptations up on the track, it's mathematical (Doo-wop)
Sometimes I'm feeling up, sometimes I'm feeling down
It feel good, don't it? We gon' put it down (Doo-wop)
I flow phenomenal, verbally my abdominal
Play me, I'm like a domino, jumpin' just like Geronimo (Doo-wop)
I'ma go tell my story, they clockin' likе it's work right
Equality is never debatablе, that's a birthright (Doo-wop)
So love is hard labour, be peaceful to your neighbour
It's old school to new school, this be the new flavour (Doo-wop)
See, love is hard labour, be peaceful to your neighbour
It's old school to new school, this be the new flavour (Woo!)

[Chorus: The Temptations]
We need peace, we need change
Save my soul, let it
We need peace, we need change
Save my soul, let it
We need peace, we need change
Save my soul, let it
We need peace, we need change
Save my soul

[Post-Chorus: K. Sparks and (The Temptations)]
Can I get some love with a little side of peace?
Can I get some love with a little side of peace?
(Can I get some love) with a little side of peace?
(Can I get some love) with a little side of peace?
Can I get some love with a little side of peace?
Can I get some love with a little side of peace?
(Can I get some love) with a little side of peace?
(Can I get some love) with a little side of peace?

[Verse 2: K. Sparks and The Temptations]
Ayo, sometimes in life, street ghetto take you through them darker places
Just keep the faith in God, and always, you can win the race
And that's on one accord, give praises to the Lord
See, being humble take you places can't afford (Hey, now) (Doo-wop)
'Cause life is mental, I play like instrumentals
I'm lookin' all around and can it be so simple (Oh oh) (Doo-wop)
'Cause life is mental, I play like instrumentals
I'm lookin' all around and can it be so simple

[Chorus: The Temptations]
We need peace, we need change
Save my soul, let it
We need peace, we need change
Save my soul, let it
We need peace, we need change
Save my soul, let it
We need peace, we need change
Save my soul, let it

We need peace, we need change
Save my soul, let it
We need peace, we need change
Save my soul

[Intro]
I can't breathe! I can't breathe! I can't breathe!
No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace!
I matter! We matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter!

It's time for the people to stand up for their rights
Oh, yes, it's time for the people to bring the darkness to the light
Oh, yes, it's time for the people to gеt the job done
It's time, it's timе, it's time, time, time, time

[Verse 1]
Can I get everybody's attention (Over here?)
I got something I wanna tell ya (Like music to your ear)
If we don't stand for something (We're surely gonna fall)
So let's stand together (All for one, one for all)
Don't let these people try to fool ya (They don't know what the problem is)
They done changed the game into a bit (Giving more people the biz)
There's a whole lotta people confused, too (The blind leading the blind)
Would you be at the front (Or the end of the line?)
Or the end of the line?

[Chorus]
It's time for the people (Oh!) to stand up for their rights (Come on, y'all!)
Oh, yes, it's time for the people (It's time) to bring the darkness to the light
Oh, yes, it's time for the people (Ooh, yeah) to get the job done
It's time, it's time, it's time, time, time, time (Oh, it's time)

[Verse 2]
Knowledge is power (Lets spread it around)
Oh, stop being manipulated (Act like you're educated)
You'd be surprised of the power (Power the people got)
You can use it any time you want, believe it or not
No matter what colour you are (Red, white, black, or brown)
If you're gonna be part of the changes (Start doing it now)
We've been taken advantage of long enough (Long enough)
Don't you know by now, they're calling our bluff? Woo

[Chorus]
It's time for the people to stand up for their rights (Stand up, it's time)
Oh, yes, it's time for the people to bring the darkness to the light (Darkness to the light, yeah)
Oh, yes, it's time for the people to get the job done (Hey)
It's time (Time), it's time (Time), it's time, time, time, time

[Bridge]
Step up to the plate, and use your ball (Use your ball)
Times won't get no better, just by saying, "I hope"
Drugs and alcohol are killing our neighbourhood
I bet the plan is goin' just like they thought it would

[Verse 3]
Realise, organise, don't apologise
The things they're doin' to us, they're doin' in front of our eyes
No matter what colour you are, red, white, black, or brown
If we're gonna be part of the changes, we gotta start doing it now

[Breakdown]
Wake up, people! Start using your mind
If you don't start thinking, you're gonna be left behind
Drugs and alcohol are meant to kill
And we are tired, against our will
Stop, think
We still got time to change

[Chorus]
It's time for the people to stand up for their rights
Oh, yes, it's time for the people to bring the darkness to the light
Oh, yes, it's time for the people to get the job done
It's time, it's time, it's time, time, time, time

It's time for the people to stand up for their rights (You better believe me when I tell you)
Oh, yes, it's time for the people to bring the darkness to the light
(The time has finally come)
Oh, yes, it's time for the people to get the job done (We can do it together, yes, we can)
It's time, it's time, it's time, time, time, time (We can do it, we can)

[Bridge]
Step up to the plate, and use your ball
(It's time for the people to stand up for their rights)
Times won't get no better, just by saying, "I hope"
(Oh, yes, it's time for the people to bring the darkness to the light)
Drugs and alcohol are killing our neighbourhood
(Oh, yes, it's time for the people to get the job done)
I bet the plan is goin' just like they thought it would
(It's time, it's time, it's time, time, time, time)

[Chorus]
It's time for the people to stand up for their rights (Somebody better let the young people know)
Oh, yes, it's time for the people to bring the darkness to the light (Go to the pones 

[?], make sure you use your bones)
Oh, yes, it's time for the people to get the job done (That's the only way the world's gon' survive)
It's time, it's time, it's time, time, time, time (That's the only way we gon' stay alive, hey, hey, hey)

[Outro]
It's time for the people

It's time for the people

[Intro]
World!
Oh no
Temptations, boom-boom (World!)
Boom-boom (Oh no)
Boom-boom, boom-boom

[Verse 1]
What do you know
With all the years behind me
Signs they do show
The feelings brand new
Pages do flow
It's no longer springtime
Seasons do change
But I'm still drowning in blue

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter the where that I go
Or the how that I try
No difference who's by my side
If that who is not you
And no matter the when
Or whatever the why
I stand still with time

[Chorus]
Time used to fly
'Til you walked out that door
The sand doesn't fall
Through the hourglass anymore
And the hands on the clock
They don't get around now, I'm sure
My whole world stopped without you
(Oh, no)

[Verse 2]
Back in the day (Boom-boom)
I clearly remember (Boom-boom)
Strolling the shore (Boom-boom)
With time on our side
But it slipped away (Boom-boom)
Right through our fingers (Boom-boom)
But it's not too late
To turn back the page
And find what we left behind

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm saying that now that I'm older
And a little bit wiser
I look over my shoulder
And see the best thing that's happened to me
Now I know that
Please let me show that
Love heals in time

[Chorus]
Time used to fly
'Til you walked out that door
The sand doesn't fall
Through the hourglass anymore
And the hands on the clock
They don't get around now, I'm sure
My whole world stopped without you

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter the where that I go
Or the how that I try
No difference who's by my side
If that who is not you
And no matter the when
Or whatever the why
I stand still with time

[Chorus]
Time used to fly
'Til you walked out that door
The sand doesn't fall
Through the hourglass anymore
And the hands on the clock
They don't get around now, I'm sure
My whole world stopped without you

[Outro]
(Without you) Without you
(Without you) Without you (You)

[Intro]
Well, alright
Never
Oh oh oh, yeah
Baby
Listen, here
Tell ya
Talkin' 'bout

[Verse 1]
I remember the time (I remember)
When that girl was all, all mine (She was)
We had so many good times together
Everybody knows we used to hang like wet clothes

[Pre-Chorus]
One thing's for certain, in life, there's change
And now my life has been re-arranged
From sugar pie, and now I say goodbye
Lord, I knew what I had, but that girl has gone back, hey!

[Chorus]
You don't your woman (Like I do, hey)
I wish that I could tell you the truth (Tell you the truth, oh)
Beware of pretty skirts (Skirts, yeah)
'Cause pretty skirts can hurt (Hurt)
I bet you don't your woman like I do (Bet you don't know your woman, yeah, yeah)
Hey, hey, babe
Ooh

[Verse 2]
From breakfast in bed (And what)
To rubbing my feet (Mmhmm)
Listen to the Isley Brothers sing 'Between the Sheets'
She did things to me, and I wonder if she's doing 'em to you, yeah
Her love would stretch for miles, for 

[?] and then

[Pre-Chorus]
She's the kind of woman that you won't ever forget
She's the kind of girl you wanna take home to Mother
Now she's gone, and I'm all alone
Tall, dark, and then some, you wanna leave her alone

[Chorus]
You don't your woman (Like I do, hey, well, I)
I wish that I could tell you the truth (Tell you)
Beware of pretty skirts (Pretty skirts)
'Cause pretty skirts can hurt
I bet you don't your woman like I do (Oh)
You don't your woman (Like I do, baby, hey)
I wish that I could tell you the truth (Tell you the truth, darlin')
Beware of pretty skirts (Hey)
'Cause pretty skirts can hurt (Skirts can hurt)
I bet you don't your woman like I do (Bet you don't know your woman)

[Break]
Woohoo, hey
Alright
Hey
Yeah

Yeah, yeah
Come on with me
Now, step to the left
Uh, just stay with me
Now, back to the middle
You know what I mean
Now we on the right side
Hey, yeah
Come on, y'all

[Chorus]
You don't your woman (Like I do, baby, hey, hey)
I wish that I could tell you the truth (Tell you the truth, darlin')
Beware of pretty skirts (Yeah)
'Cause pretty skirts can hurt (They will hurt you)
I bet you don't your woman like I do (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You don't your woman (Like I do, baby, that's alright)
I wish that I could tell you the truth (Tell you the truth)

[Intro]
Hoo!

[Verse 1]
I just met a woman (Woman)
Who's as fine as she can be
She told me something (Something)
Don't believe in all you see
When it comes to who lovin'
It's a matter of the heart
When emotions get in the way
That's when logic begins to stray
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
How do you spell love? (Tell me, how?)
How do you spell L.O.V.E? (I wanna know, I wanna know)
How do you spell love? (I spell it L.O.V.E, girl)
Rainbow stars and touch-of-Venus love
Love

[Verse 2]
Love comes in different sizes (Yeah)
Small, medium, and large if you're trying
Oh, girl, there's no excuse for us not to be together
We endure any kind of weather, baby
Oh, infatuation's stimulating adulation
What a beautiful thing that we're in
You got them beat by a quantum leap, girl (Girl)
You're one (You're one) of a kind (Of a kind)
And that's so hard to find (Hoo!)

[Chorus]
How do you spell love? (I spell it L.O.V.E, girl)
How do you spell L.O.V.E? (L.O.V.E, girl)
How do you spell love? (I spell it L.O.V.E, girl)
Rainbow stars and touch-of-Venus love
Well

[Bridge]
(L) Love is all you need, ah
(O) Over and over ain't ever enough
(V) We will always be victorious in love
(E) Everlasting, like the morning sunrise

How do you spell, spell, spell, spell ... (Uh)
How do you spell, spell, spell, spell ...
Oh, somebody tell me how

[Chorus]
How do you spell love? (I treat her like a lady)
How do you spell L.O.V.E? (She's my girl, yeah)
How do you spell love? (It was just my imagination)
Rainbow stars and touch-of-Venus love (She got me, she got me, she got me on cloud nine, yeah)

How do you spell love? (I spell it L.O.V.E, girl) (I wanna know, baby)
How do you spell L.O.V.E? (L.O.V.E)

Every time we kiss, I want a little more

[Verse 2]
The way you dance (The way you dance) messes with my mind (Ooh, ooh)

All I wanna do, girl, is watch you while you dance

[Chorus]
Girl, you know I want it

Girl, you know I need it

Hahaha, alright, baby, let me show you how this is done

You have to put your hand on my hips, you have to make me move if you want this to work
You don't just come in a dancehall for just standup and all up the wall

But you have to talk to me right, tell me what you want me fi do
Talk to me, now, talk to me, baby

I guess the coke got in my pores from touching all the bricks
So I just wrapped 'em up and wrote Tyson on each
I got 'em biting ears and biting their teeth
I'm talking 'bout that good snow, temp low
Don't be surprised if I sneeze
Excuse me, god bless me, thank you
Socks on the coupe cover the ankles
I'm driving so fast I might sprain 'em
They be tryna bite the style like a caiman
But we know it's all Wayne's, no Damon
Only God can judge me, Jesus piece on in my arraignment
Fuck you talkin' bout? Explain it
Dana Dane chains on, looking sweeter than a Danish
Painting pictures with his guts, artistic genius
I stand back and admire my art and kiss my fingers
And in God I trust, mwah
My nina say she wanna get her body done
Before I load the gun I told my bullets "All we got is us"
Lambi on blades, propellers, blunt long as Coachella
Mother knows best and daddy don't know no better
I know you smell him, it's Young Tunechi Coca
My uncle Rufus just OD'ed, we burning down the dope house
This shit calamitous, animals
And they all with the shit, unanimous
I'm sicker than an ambulance
I'm shittin' like a baby that got sick of all the pampering
She foreign, Yugoslavian
I throw this dick and she gon' act like I just threw a javelin
Ooh, wait, yeah yeah, uh

[Chorus]
And that's Lil T on the audio, uh
We like Luigi and Mario, uh
Every bar be like a bar of soap, uh
Every flow be like a marble floor, uh
Used to buy weed by the corner store, uh
Buy whole pounds of Master P, uh
I'm a roll me a Lil Romeo, wait
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
That chef boy'r T and he on the stove, yeah
We like Luigi and Mario, yeah
Every bar be like a bar of soap, yeah
Every flow be like a marble floor, yeah
We tote styrofoams and we comatose, yeah
I buy a pound of some Master P, yeah
I'm a roll me a Lil Romeo, wait

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Huh, huh

[Verse 1]
Uh, pick 'em off, I fuck 'em all then egg 'em on
Her nipples hard and a nigga cold
Before silicone she was skin and bones
Surfin' that shit like Billabong
Her nigga home, they don't get along
This the only dick she be sittin' on
Bitch ain't gon' be playin' no Game of Thrones
Hold on', hold on', bubble butt with these hands, I caress that
Bust a nut on her ass, call her wetback
Collar tucked, skinny pants, I finesse that
Wings up on the Lamb 'cause it's jet black
Pew, I ain't mad at her
Shе got a man, tell your man you just got manhandled
Pop that cran apple, thе pussy panhandler
I fuck her good, I put her to sleep, I Mr. Sandman her

[Chorus]
Mm, dark cider, my nuts make me walk wider
I pull up in a soft top, the car timeless
I'm a sharpshooter, I be with sharpshotters
Money talks, nigga, I got that yada-yada

[Verse 2]
She say "Get in my belly"
I put dick up in her stomach, she say "Get in my belly"
I put dick up in her stomach, she say "Get in my belly"
She sit on this motherfucker like Corinthian leather
Dick up in her stomach, she say "Get in my belly"
Bought a Birkin for my blicka, she say "Nigga, I'm jelly"
Put some white girl on my thumb, she lick that bitch like a lesbian
Said the truth is hard to swallow, she ain't no lie detector, hold on

[Refrain]
Westside, I like my weed like my bitches, from the Westside
I be leanin', I be sippin', I be just fine
Red beam and I ain't talkin' 'bout no X5
Red beam and I ain't talkin' 'bout no X5

[Verse 3]
Dreads slingin', red flag down my hair tie
Take the kilos out the bag, let 'em air dry
Throw a P up for Pirus, shit that PS5
Throw a P up for Pirus, shit that PS5
I'm a speed up in that new whip, fuck a test drive
I'm a creep up on them niggas like a hairline
Creep up on them niggas like a–
I'ma creep up on them niggas like I'm Left Eye

[Refrain]
I'ma squeeze that fuckin' trigger like a necktie
On codeine, I'm like a turtle, I'm a reptile
Red beam and I ain't talkin' 'bout no X5
Red beam and I ain't talkin' 'bout no X5

[Verse 4]
I'ma speed up in her pussy, fuck her sex drive
I'ma creep up on them niggas like they deaf, slime
I'ma creep up my lil' nigga like a–, like a–
I'ma creep up my lil' nigga like a deadline
Got them sleepin' with the fishes, he was dead-tired
Send a PJ for my bitches, fuck a red eye
Let her pussy open up and I'ma headline
Want a good ting nigga with some money on it
All these karats in my chain make a bunny hop
I be laughin' 'to the bank 'cause it's funny, yup
In the belly of the beast where the stomach at
Hold on, shoot 'em in the–, shoot 'em in the head, that part, nigga, ooh

[Chorus]
Mm, dark cider, my nuts make me walk wider
I pull up in a soft top, the car timeless

Money talks, nigga, I got that yada-yada

[Outro]
Ooh, Westside, like my weed like my bitches, from the Westside

Red beam and I ain't talkin' 'bout no X5
Red beam and I ain't talkin' 'bout no X5

Just like back in the day

Tryin’ chase the tears away
I M-I-S-S you (I miss you)
I M-I-S-S you (You know I do)

[Verse 2]
Do you consider this desperate (Uh)
Cause I reminisce
All my sexy gеstures (Sexy gesturеs)
Do my eyes like this (Woo)
I need your touch
Hey (Yeah)
I wanna...
Hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember we ring around the rosies
And your pocket pick with pose (Pocket pick with pose)
I know what it does to you
That pink polish on my toes (Pink polish on my toes)
You whip that thing, you whip that thing

Tryin' chase the tears away (Tryin' chase the oh, ooh)
I M-I-S-S you (I miss you)
I M-I-S-S you (You know I do)

[Bridge]
What am I supposed to do, a young girl
Thinkin’ these nasty things in this world, woah
Woah, woah (I can't help myself)
Woah
Who must bring about stress
But when am I supposed to stay repressed, no-oh
No-oh, no-oh
No-oh

I would turn down the lights
(I'd be the only thing that you could see)
Let the music moan
(Then, let the music moan)
What am I to do
When I'm the only one home
Only one home (Uh)

[Chorus]
Can you come out to play
Just like back in the day
I M-I-S-S you (Oh, you know I do)

[Outro]
Oh-oh-ooh (Mmm)
Oh yeah (Oh yeah, mm)
(I just can't help myself)

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart
Why do you play with my mind?
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say goodbye?

[Pre-Chorus: Wanya Morris]
When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head, oh, I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman]
Girl, I know you really love me
You just don't realizе
You've never been thеre before
It's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you, mmm
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together
Forever, you and I

[Pre-Chorus: Wanya Morris]
Will you love me again like you loved me before
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead, just come to my bed
And baby, just don't let me go

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
Although we've come to the end of the road
(End of the road)
Still I can't let go
(The end of the road and I know I can't let go, baby)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

[Interlude: Michael McCary, Shawn Stockman]
Girl, I'm here for you
All those times of night when you just hurt me
And just ran out with that other fella
Baby, I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you, do you?
I'm here for you
I'm not out to go out and cheat on you all night
(Baby, I'm here for you, baby)
Just like you did baby but that's all right
(Baby, you tried)
Hey, I love you anyway
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'till my dying day, baby
(We should be happy together forever, you and I)
Right now, I'm just in so much pain, baby
'Cause you just won't come back to me
Will you? Just come back to me
(Lonely)
Yes, baby, my heart is lonely
(Lonely)
My heart hurts, baby
(Lonely)
Yes, I feel pain, too
Baby, please

[Pre-Chorus: Wanya Morris]
This time instead, just come to my bed
And baby, just don't let me go

[Outro: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
(Alright, alright, alright)
It's unnatural (It's unnatural)
You belong to me (You belong to me)
I belong to you (I belong to you, woah)
Come to the end of the road

[Fades out]
(Although we've come to the end of the road)
Still I can't let go
(I know I just can't let go, no, no, no)
It's unnatural (No, no, no, no, no, no)
You belong to me, I belong to you
(Although we've come to the end of the road)
Verse 1:
At 12 o clock I eneter the club, at 12:15 Im looking at her
Dancing like its her birthday, like shes on a vacay and Im just gonna hang out right here til its clear
Visions of her working the pole, the combination of her ass and patron. Makes a nigga wanna make it rain, like a (?) parade, I can't wait til I get you home. Up in the champagne room, I got you moaning. Because you grinding on a really hard something
Its foreplay, Im the winner, Its gonna be, like dinner
Patience is a virtue, and girl I feel so glad that I..

Hook:
Waited all night for you to finish that dance, tipsy of the liquor and its making me ask would you (Tip the waiter) you, (Tip the waiter) you (tip the waiter). Girl I want some gratuity I dont mean cash, lookin at your body its makin me ask would you  (Tip the waiter) you, (Tip the waiter) you (tip the waiter)

[Verse 1]
Why you always doin' that?
Breakin' up with me, then makin' up
Just to make me mad

[Pre-Chorus]
I think that you taste like rock candy
Sweet like beaches, leave me all sandy
Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes?
Young love don't always last forever
Wild horses can't keep us together
So what if you taste just like heaven?
That don't make it right
Hot summer and cold watermelon
Your love stings like blood and a lemon
Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes?

[Chorus]
Watеrcolor eyes
Watercolor еyes
Watercolor eyes
That don't make it right

[Verse 2]
Why you always doin' that?
Playing guitar while I'm sleepin'
Actin' like a brat

[Pre-Chorus]
I think that you're sweet like rock candy
Warm like beaches that leave me sandy
Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes?
Young love don't always last forever
Wild horses can't keep us together
So what if you taste just like heaven?
That don't make it right
Hot summer and cold watermelon
Your love stings like blood and a lemon
Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes?

[Chorus]
Watercolor eyes
Watercolor eyes
Watercolor eyes
That don't make it right
Watercolor eyes
Watercolor eyes
Watercolor eyes
That don't make it right

[Verse 3]
Why you always doin' that?
Breakin' up with me, then makin' up
Just to make me mad

[Outro]
Oh-oh
Hey, hey
Why?
That don't make it right
Carry me home, got my blue nail polish on
It's my favorite color and my favorite tone of song
I don't really wanna break up, we got it going on
It's what you gathered from our talk, but you were wrong

It's not easy for me to talk about
I have heavy heart-strings
I'm not simple, it's trigonometry
It's hard to express
I can't explain

Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

Because I'm going deeper and deeper (deeper)
Harder and harder (harder)
Getting darker and darkеr
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh my God
In all thе wrong places
Oh my God
Carry me home, got my new car and my gun
Wind in my hair, holding your hand, listen to our song
Carry me home, don't wanna talk about the things to come
Just put your hands up in the air, the radio on
Cause there's nothing for us to talk about
Like the future and those things
Cause there's nothing for me to think about
Now that he's gone, I can't feel nothing

Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

Because I'm going deeper and deeper (deeper)
Harder and harder (harder)
Getting darker and darker
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh my God
In all the wrong places
Oh my God

You should've known better
Than to have, to let her
Get you under her spell of the weather
I got you where I want you
You're deader than ever
And falling for forever
I'm playing head games with you
Got you where I want you
I got you, I got you
I got you where I want you now
Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

It's not one of those phases I'm going through
Or just a song, it's not one of them
I'm on my own
On my own
On my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again
You said I was the most exotic flower
Holding me tight in our final hour

I don't know how you convince them and get them, but
I don't know what you do, it's unbelievable
And I don't know how you get over, get over
Someone as dangerous, tainted and flawed as you

One for the money, and two for the show
I love you honey, I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way, I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
And look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

You got the world but baby at what price
Something so strange, hard to define

It isn't that hard boy to like you or love you
I'd follow you down down down You're unbelievable
If you're going crazy just grab me and take me
I'd follow you down down down, anywhere anywhere
One for the money, two for the show
I love you honey, I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way, I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
And look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

One for the money, two for the show
I love you honey, I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way, I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
And look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke

I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
And look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?
Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean (Oh-oh) and love hurts (Oh-oh)
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh, baby

I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll rеmember that you're minе
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby), say you'll remember
Oh, baby, ooh—I will love you till the end of time

Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, "No, please—stay here
We don't need no money, we could make it all work"
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipating, and pacing
But he was chasing (Oh-oh) paper (Oh-oh)
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby), say you'll remember
Oh, baby, ooh—I will love you till the end of time

You went out every night, and baby, that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
'Cause I'ma ride or die, whether you fail or fly
Well, shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more; that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before, we were dancing all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember

I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby), say you'll remember
Oh, baby, ooh—I will love you till the end of time

[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now
He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it

[Verse 1]
Long nights in your car, mornings in your arms
From five hour calls to nothing at all
I guess time's a sign, writing on the wall, ooh
Don't know where it all went wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
But if this is how it's got to be
I need someone to tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me

[Chorus]
What comes after love?
I wanna know there's something for me after us
I don't think my heart was made to break this much
Tell me there is happy ever after love
Tell me there is happy ever after us

[Verse 2]
I know you said that this was meant to be
Now these words are ancient history
At least I get to keep the memories, uh
Mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall
Will somebody catch me when I fall?
So then I'll keep on dancing on my own

[Pre-Chorus]
But if this is how it's got to be
I need someone to tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me

[Chorus]
What comes after love?
I wanna know there's something for me after us
I don't think my heart was made to break this much
Tell me there is happy ever after love
Tell me there is happy ever after us

[Bridge]
I believe, I believe, I believe in love
Even if, even if it wasn't meant for us
I believe, I believe, I believe in love (I believe in love)
I just need someone to tell me

[Chorus]
What comes after love?
I wanna know there's something for me after us
I don't think my heart was made to break this much
Tell me there is happy ever after love
Tell me there is happy ever after us
What comes after love?
I wanna know there's something for me after us
I don't think my heart was made to break this much
Tell me there is happy ever after love
Tell me there is happy ever after us
Let me
Come and show
I'mma show to the crowd that's how everybody now behold you
To the every beat that I and you all groove
I ain't tryna fallin' in like we're supposed to
You know your moves are rough
Say you love me
Say you love me and don't let go (Ooo... I'll be here)
Hide your feelings don't let them show(Don't let them show)
You wanna just swing it though
“And I will wait for you at the important place
Do not fail us, the mission will be completed tonight!”

[Verse 1]
I wanna get to know ya
I wanna know your mind
I like to do it backwards
You can’t do it in just one night
And everybody's out to get ya
The way you looked was no surprise
And if you want a girl to love ya
Just gaze into her eyes and say

[Chorus]
“Oohhhh” x6

[Verse 2]
It’s not hard to fall in love
People do it all the time
Romeo had Juliet
And that worked out just fine
Adam had an apple
Eve had too much wine
She put the apple on his head
Pulled the trigger, then closed her еyes

[Chorus]
“Oohhhh” x6

Love is so simple
First, it's grеat and then it hurts
But it takes too long to realise
That it’s more trouble than it's worth
If what she did to you
Was done to her by someone first
Then find someone you care about
And make sure you do it worse

[Chorus]
“Oohhhh” x6

[Instrumental]

Hope that I am worthy of your love
Hope I am deserving of your love
Hope you can brush off the powers that be
Hope I can teach you how to be mostly happy
Hope you don't let the world crush you
For it is beautiful out there and there's a lot to see

Hope that I am worthy of your love
Hope that I am worthy of your love
Hope that I am worthy of your love
Is catching smoke
Looking for the ephemeral
Swallowing the sun in a moonlight room
Standing at the foot of a rainbow
Everybody here is catching smoke
Looking for the ephemeral
Riding on a yellow-bellied brown snake
Sipping on hedonism

Catching smoke, catching smoke, catching smoke

Catching smoke, catching smoke, catching smoke
Catching smoke, catching smoke, catching smoke

Hit-boy

[Chorus: Nardo Wick]
I got a hundred hoes, I'm still lonely

Lyrics From Snippet

[Intro: Playboi Carti]
What?

[Chrous: Baby Keem]
We off the grid, grid, grid, grid
This for my kids, kids, kids, kids....

[Verse: Baby Keem]
We ain't apologetic
We ain't apologising
We ain't apolo' for shit

[Verse 1]
Love is not a game with me
Played with inconsistency
Though my love turned out to be
Here today and gone tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Love is like a candlelight
Sometimes flickering sometimes bright
Sometimes burning up the night
Here today and gone tomorrow

[Verse 3]
Love is something of a rover
Comes to town and takes a lover
Packs his bag and then it's over
Here today and gone tomorrow

[Verse 4]
Love's a field of sugar cane
Sunshine smiles and teardrop rain
Feed it till it's cut again
Here today and gone tomorrow

[Verse 5]
Love's a rainbow in the sky
None can reach it, still they try
Rainbow chasing fool am I
Here today and gone tomorrow

[Verse 6]
Love must be the birds in spring
Only lovers hear them sing
All too soon they're on the wing
Here today and gone tomorrow

[Verse 7]
No love is not a game with me
Played with inconsistency
Though my love turned out to be
Here today and gone tomorrow
What will you give me for one prairie night?
Silver fields and meadows and the moon’s silver light
Mister cat in the hay loft with silvery eye
All these precious possessions I’ll sell, if you’ll buy

What will you give me for one prairie day?
The golden fields of autumn and the primrose in May
Sun’s courtin’ meadowlarks, off in the sky
All those precious possessions I’ll sell if you’ll buy

What will you give me for one prairie breeze?
Rippling the grasses and rustling the trees
Wafting thе scent of the newly mown hay
All thosе precious possessions I’ll sell if you’ll pay

What will you give me for one prairie sky?
An amethyst sea with cloud galleons sailing by
The aurora dancing on cold winter nights
All these precious possessions I’ll sell for a price

What will you give me for one prairie day?
With the earth cracked and smokin’
Where we’d crossed yesterday
Gone the birds from the air, gone the child I begot
All those precious possessions I sold, and for what?
Old Mister Wind - hear him howl
Even the moon seems to scowl
Even the skies seem to sympathize
As they weep into
Their leafy cryin' towel

I didn't sleep last night
Room is gettin' light
That old sun I see
Just arisin' here for me
Will be settin' someplace else
For you tonight

You're a rambler a rover
You've been this wild world over
All you ask of life is to be free
When those boots I've been lickin'
Feel a little more like stickin'
Please let it be here and let it be me

Maybe if the day you left this town
I'd acted more the lover less the clown
Maybe if I'd cried those tears I'd learn to hide
I'd be with you on that road you're fadin' down
You're a rambler a rover
You've been this wild world over
All you ask of life is to be free
When those boots I've been lickin'
Feel a little more like stickin'
Please let it be here and let it be me
Please let it be here and let it be me
Here I sit a-learnin'
Candlelight a-burnin'
Castin' flickerin' shadows on the wall
Open book before me
Tryin' its best to bore me
Up in the hills the lonesome coyote's call
Cryin' for his sweetheart
Cryin' for the moon
Cryin' just for cryin's sake
He'll have me cryin' soon
Wonder if he's lonely
Guess I'm not the only
Creature on this earth who's all alone

Spring's creepin' up the valley
And I know my best pal he's
Up there somewhere catching fireflies
But my lesson's ain't completed and I
Just can't be defeated
By the sights and sounds
That tease my ears and eyes
Outside my window
The night is full of sounds
Hootin' of a hooting owl
Layin' of my hounds
But here I sit a-learnin'
And grumblin' and gol durnin'
Ain't gonna help these lessons to go by

Eight times twelve how many
And here's a guy called Benny
Flew a kite into a lightnin' storm
Who killed ole cock robin
While all the birds were sobbin'
Gee that evenin' air smells sweet and warm
Who can study silly words
When the creek begins to run
And the crocus pops up from the ground
I challenge anyone

Now it's off to school tomorrow with
Apologies and sorrow
But I've gotta watch the season being born
Yes I've gotta watch the season being born
I've gotta watch the season being born
Kiss me on a Sunday
A hop and skip and run day
And though he left on Monday
His kiss stayed lingering

In the days to follow
My heart became a hollow
And like the lonely swallow
I've but one song to sing
Of happy sorrow only love can bring

Letter came on Tuesday
Goodbye to those blues days
He asked me that good new day
To catch the Wednesday train

Hands of clock are lagging
Hours pass a dragging
Warning tongues are wagging
You'll break your heart again
But I know this love
Would never bring me pain
Often while we wander
My love and I do ponder
Which of us is fonder
Of the new love each has found

I say he's the baker
The makes the wonder awaken
Take the refuge that she's seekin
From the stormy world around
And forget the lonely places
She was bound
Me and my uncle went ridin' down
From Colorado, west Texas bound
And we stopped off in Santa Fe
It bein’ the place about half way
And besides it was the hottest part of the day

We led our ponies into a stall
Went to the bar, boys, bought drinks for all
Two days in the saddle, my body hurt
It being summer, took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

West Texas cowboys, all over town
With gold and silver, they’re loaded down
Just in from roundup, it seemed a shame
And so my uncle starts a friendly game
Now it’s hollow jack and winner take the game

From the beginning, uncle starts to win
Them Texas cowboys, they was mad as sin
Some say he’s cheatin’, that can’t be
‘Cause my uncle, he's as honest as me
And I'm as honest as a Denver gal can be
One Texas cowboy, he starts to draw
I grabbed a bottle, slapped him on the jaw
I shot another, he won’t grow old
In the confusion, uncle grabbed the gold
And we hightailed it down to Mexico

Now God bless cowboys, and God bless gold
God bless my uncle, and rest his soul
He taught me well boys, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, boys, I grabbed that gold
And I left him lyin’ there, I left him lyin’ there
I left him lyin’ there by the side of the road

[Verse 1]
Gone, just as lonely as before
There's his smoke against the ceiling
And his ashes on the floor
Gone golden genie in the blaze of a thousand sorries
Ashes and smoke are all that's staying
They'll soon be going
With the sad winds blowin'

[Verse 2]
Dark, strike a match and light a candle
Candles always look so hopeful
But it's more than I can handle

[Studio Chatter]

[Verse 2]
Dark, strike a match and light a candle
Candles always look so hopeful
But it's more than I can handle
Cry for a river from the sun
It's just as easy
Flame on the candle's almost donе
It'll soon be going
With the sad winds blowin'

[Verse 3]
Times, just a sеnseless lot of ticking
She's the master of our people

[Studio Chatter]
Ah, if that's good enough for you, I don't know?
Eyes that send me chasing after feelings that I lost one day
Why befriend me when the brandy tells me what they want to say?
Playing big protector is a grand disguise
'Til you contradict yourself with brandy eyes

No beginning -- still no end to let me shrug and walk away
Silly grinning, teasing talk that promises a kiss some day
I would put you out of mind if I were wise
But wisdom has no power over brandy eyes

Maybe I'm wrong
If I am please pardon me and pat my head

Sing an old song
Sing of one more foolish heart that's being misled
Takе the points for winning and donate the prizе
And keep on a-scoring with those brandy eyes
I come from a place in Canada called Saskatoon, Saskatchewan which, to some people sounds like a disease. Up there we joke about Kalamazoo, Michigan. When I found out that that place really does exist, I was amazed. But erm, the winters in Saskatchewan are very cool, the seasons are cool, and the temperature changes as much as 150 degrees in a year, which is pretty radical. And, when winter comes and, Decembеr comes, and January is threatening to comе, with temperatures dropping to 50 below zero, the people begin to act very peculiarly, and they say "Hey, why can't I go some place else for the winter?" And some of them who have enough money, the wealthy farmers actually do go down to some place like Miami or Bermuda, the Bahamas, places like that, just to escape it. But the rest of the people have to sit it out, with the blizzards and the blusters, and, this is how they feel I think...

[Verse 1]
I awoke today and found a frost perched on the town
It hovered in a frozen sky, then it gobbled summer down
When the sun turns traitor cold
And all the trees are shivering in a naked row
I get the urge for going but I never seem to go

[Chorus]
I get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
Summertime is falling down
And winter's closing in

[Verse 2]
I had me a man in summertime, he had summer-colored skin
And not another girl in town my darling's heart could win
But when the leaves fell on the ground, and
Bully winds did rub their faces in the snow
He got the urge for going and I had to let him go

[Chorus]
He got the urge for going
When the meadow grass was turning brown, an'
Summertime was falling down
An' winter closing in

[Verse 3]
Now the warriors of winter, gave a cold triumphant shout
And all that stays is dying, all that lives is getting out
See the geese in chevron flight
Flapping and racing on before the snow
They got the urge for going and they got the wings to go

[Chorus]
They get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
And summertime is falling down
And winter's closing in

[Verse 4]
So I'll ply the fire with kindling now, pull up blankets up to my chin
I'll lock the vagrant winter out and fold my wandering in
I'd like to call back summertime, and
Have her stay for just another month or so
But she's got the urge for going so I guess she'll have to go

[Chorus]
She gets the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown, and
All her empire's falling down
And winter's closing in

[Outro]
And I get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
And summertime is falling down
The other day I was reading in a magazine that, erm, Bob Dylan has written one of his songs by taking left-over lines from dozens of songs he'd never finished, and I decided "By golly, I've got about 15 unfinished songs at home, and what I'm gonna do with them, I'm gonna take the lines I like out of each one of them, an I'm gonna kind of cram them all together into a mulligan stew kind of song."

But the things was that, all of the songs were on very, very different topics, and, so, to put them into one song, I had to dеvelop them 'round a very basic plot... And a rock-and-roll bеat. It goes...

Now the plot goes like this: There was a fella named Mr. Blue, who's no relation to David Blue at all. He's Mr. Blue because he's kind of sad, and he had a girlfriend, who he treated very badly, and, so she left him, and it serves him right. That's the plot

"What's The Story Mr. Blue"

[Verse 1]
What's the story, Mr. Blue
Did she pull the rug from under you
Did she chop your dreams up two by two
And kick them out the door
I could sympathize you, son
But pity words stick to my tongue
And sorry words have all been sung
So many times before

[Chorus]
Oh, Mr. Blue, you blew your chances long ago
Oh, Mr. Blue, you're through
Quit acting like it isn't so

[Stage Chatter]
This is my favourite verse

[Verse 2]
Hang on one more day or two
Then I promise I'll be laying you
Odds that she's found someone new
While you stand around and rust
She don't want no part-time man
With no part-time answer understand
She don't want an hour's fall of sand
For a lifetime full of dust

[Chorus]
Oh, Mr. Bluе, you blew your chances long ago
Oh, Mr. Blue, you'rе through
Quit acting like you didn't know

[Stage Chatter]
This is my second favourite verse

[Verse 3]
Mr. Blue, you missed the shot
Didn't turn out quite the way you thought
It would, I'll bet, 'cause you got caught
Out playing Donald Juan
She's got polish, she's got class
And someday when on the street you pass her house
You'll wonder why the grass
Looks greener on her lawn

[Chorus]
Oh, Mr. Blue, you blew your chances long ago
Oh, Mr. Blue, you're through
Quit acting like it isn't so

[Stage Chatter]
I started to write a song once that went:
"In a day or two
I'll be laying you
Odds"
And I never thought I'd get to use that line, you know? A lot of people never catch that, 'til the end, and then they always say, "Naughty child!", you know, they have that look on their face

[Verse 1]
Rain comes from the east one night
We watch it come
To hang like beaded curtains
'Til the morning sun
Water dripping from our clothes
You with raindrops on your nose
Ask me sadly "Please don't go away now"
'Til the rain is done
I say "I'll stay now"

[Verse 2]
Rain outside but inside we don't mind at all
Shadows by the fire slowly climb and fall
Kisses fade and leave no trace
Whispers vanish into space
The dawn will send me on a chase to nowhere
Why cry as if I were the first to go there

[Chorus]
And I know I shouldn't be hеre
Yes, I know I should go home
But that еastern rain drones in my brain
And I'm so all alone, so all alone

[Verse 3]
Morning comes up from the east
We watch it come
And far away now rolls the ancient rain God's drum
You with daybreak in your eyes
Afraid to speak for telling lies
I watch you search for some reply to lend me
But when the rain is done
There's no pretending

[Chorus]
And I know I shouldn't be here
Yes, I know I should go home
But that eastern rain drones in my brain
And I'm so all alone, so all alone

[Verse 1: Usher]
Ay, girl, yeah, you the business
So what the business?
Don't be shy, I’m just talking to you, girl
Aye, ma, yo, where your man at?
I know you got that
'Cause you too fine to be single out here, girl
He at home but he done fucked up
I swooped his girl up
And what I'm about do to you, he’ll feel I did him wrong
'Cause I'm about to have a menage with his lady
And some freaks at the bar who like fucking with a star
I told her...

[Chorus: Usher]
If you're coming with me, really coming with me
You go get some girls and bring them to me
If you're coming with me, really coming with me
You let her put her hands in your pants, be my little freak
Be my little freak, be my little freak
You let her put her hands in your pants, be my little freak
If you're coming with me, really coming with me
You let her put her hands in your pants, be my little freak

[Verse 2: Usher]
Hey, girl, I see you like that
You getting excited
And you rocking like a pro with it, girl
By the way, you got right on that
With the chick you wanted
And now you in the corner, kissing on a girl
I'm about to have a menage with these here ladies
Look at those freaks at the bar, yeah, they looking for a star

[Chorus: Usher]
If you're coming with me, really coming with me
You go get some girls and bring them to me
If you’re coming with me, really coming with me
You let her put her hands in your pants, be my little freak
Be my little freak, be my little freak
You let her put her hands in your pants, be my little freak
If you’re coming with me, really coming with me
You let her put her hands in your pants, be my little freak

[Verse 3: Hot Sizzle]
Baby I'm not a slouch
And its no doubt that I won’t work you out
I bet you make a mess I make you sweat
I make you wet hold up
I'm fuckable, huggable, loveable, suckable, trustable
Anything else "-able" how the fuck am I supposed know
Since I'm finally on these women wan' follow me home
Ya girl a anaconda I can get her to swallow me whole
If you don’t think she won't
You in for a thrill
She tell you she don't
She probably will
Trust me when I say this I fucked the girl that you came with
Never met a chick who didn't gag when she tried to taste it
Liable to turn you out, she screaming what's hers is mine
So before I have sex I now tell every girl its my first time

[Chorus: Usher]
If you're coming with me, really coming with me
You go get some girls and bring them to me
If you're coming with me, really coming with me
You let her put her hands in your pants, be my little freak
Be my little freak, be my little freak
You let her put her hands in your pants, be my little freak
If you're coming with me, really coming with me
You let her put her hands in your pants, be my little freak

[Outro: Hot Sizzle]
I mean
If you gon be my lil freak you gotta do something
What up, Usher?
Im nice
I guess my best ambassador is a fella named Tom Rush, who does my second song, "Urge For Going", and err, and he also does this one, so I'm hoping that maybe you've heard it before and you'll know the chorus, because it's great to get a whole room full of people singing on it

It's a song all about the carousel of time, and err, it has a line in it which goes, "The painted ponies, they go up and down", and the funny thing is that, this year in Canada is expo, that's the 100th birthday of Canada, and everyone is madly being vеry, very patriotic and promoting their own peoplе, so as a result I've been getting a lot of television work, and err, I did one part of a series called "Shaun's Songs", which is being shown in Canada, and filmed with two people in each of the provinces, a French Canadian singer, and an English Canadian singer, so that the English Canadian singers for the first time have to watch the French Canadian singers in order to see who they want to see, and the French Canadians have to sit through me, in order to hear Jean Paul, who's also on the show. It's very diplomatic

But the thing was that they flew the French Canadian performed in and out before I got there and I noticed that while I was there they had French and English biffys on the set. "Biffy", that's a Jon to you, haha. But err, that's our own little form of segregation up there, it really isn't all that bad I guess

But the amazing thing is that the crew were French Canadian and the director was a French Canadian Dutchman by the name of Antoine Van Der Water, who had the most peculiar accent I've ever heard, and I can't reproduce it exactly, but, anyway, I came to recording this song "The Circle Game", and I thought it would be fun to go to Calgary, to the city there and, and go to the zoo where they have, erm, a merry-go-round and film it with the painted ponies going all around with lots of kids in it and everything, and he said, well, "We have merry-go-rounds everywhere, you don't need to go to Calgary, we have to have something local colour, you know?" and err, so I said "Well, gee, why don't we go out to a dude ranch 'cause Alberta's a ranching province, and we could have them drive horses around, or I could ride a horse", or something like that, and he said, "Well that's a very good idea, except, Jean Paul, he got the horses... I tell you what, we'll give you the cows, haha". And I didn't think it was so funny, but there I was standing out in the middle of a field, well, the dude ranch operator insisted that his cattle were all show cattle, and they were used to going 'round in circles. So they gathered them all up into a big herd and they drove them around me in circles, and everything went alright on the first take of the song, except that my guitar flashed into the sun a couple of times and there were big glares on the screen, so we had to do a retake. And at this point there was, erm, a young bull and an older bull, and the young bull kind of liked the older bull... As a matter of fact, he liked him right on camera. So we had to do a third take, hahaha. And then on the third take the cattle decided that they just didn't want to go around in any more of those stupid circles, and they all started spreading out, and they had to be all rounded up and herded up and circled around again. And I discovered a very interesting fact at that point, and that was that, when you stampeded cattle around in a circle more than three or four times, haha, they become very regular, haha. And I had three places that I was supposed to walk to in the course of the song and they were white-washed stones, and they were marked point A, point B, and point C, and everything, and erm, I couldn't find them, so I ended up standing right in front of the camera all the way through the song

It's very interesting though, I think, it's too bad that you can't get some of the new shows that are coming out up there. Maybe you could go up to Toronto...

Anyway, this song is called "The Circle Game"
Yesterday a child came out to wonder
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
And tearful at the falling of a star

Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
Skated over ten clear frozen streams
Words like when you're older must appease him
And promises of someday make his dreams

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captivе on the carousel of time
Wе can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
Cartwheels turn to car wheels thru the town
And they tell him take your time it won't be long now
Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
There'll be new dreams maybe better dreams and plenty
Before the last revolving year is through

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game
I close this set now with my current favourite song... Which is about a place in Toronto called Yorkville Avenue. It's kind of a small  scale Greenwich Village or Chicago Oldtown, or a large scale Detroit Plum Street. There's a village there, but it's only a block long

The people in Toronto are kinda funny about their village though because although it is one of their main tourist attractions, and quite a lovely place to go, except on weekends when you can't walk down the street, erm, people tend to criticize it a lot, and еvery time I've gonе up there the newspapers have been running some dreadful article like "True Confessions Of A Yorkville Hippie" or something like that. It's always very blasphemous, and says something like "I wouldn't let my children go down there", and all that kind of thing. But Torontonians when they get away from Toronto are very, very proud of their village, and being an ex-Toronotonian, I decided to go back to it and look at it as much through tourist eyes as I possibly could, and so I spent a night walking up and down the street and sampling the music as it came spilling out of the doorways of the clubs, and erm, then I went back to the place where I was staying and climbed the stairs and took out my pad of yellow paper with the blue lines, and my black felt pen, and I wrote this song, called "Night In The City"

[Verse 1]
Light up, light up
Light up your lazy blue eyes
Moon's up nights up
Taking the town by surprise
Night time, night time
Day left an hour ago
City light time
Must you get ready so slow
There are places to come from
And places to go

[Chorus]
Night in the city looks pretty to me
Night in the city looks fine
Music comes spilling out into the street
Colors go flashing in time

[Verse 2]
Take off, take off
Take off your stay-at-home shoes
Break off shake off
Chase off those stay-at-home blues
Stairway, stairway
Down to the crowds in the street
They go their way
Looking for faces to greet
But we run on laughing with no one to meet

[Chorus]
Night in the city looks pretty to me
Night in the city looks fine
Music comes spilling out into the street
Colors go flashing in time

[Verse 3]
Light up, light up
Light up your lazy blue eyes
Moon's up nights up
Taking the town by surprise
Night time, night time
Day left an hour ago
City light time
Must you get ready so slow
There are places to come from
And places to go

[Chorus]
Night in the city looks pretty to me
Night in the city looks fine
Music comes spilling out into the street
Colors go waltzing in time
Our guest is 

[?] and Joni Mitchell is here. Joni, are you ready?
Yes
And Joni is, err, this is her second time on our program, and 

[?]'s first, and Joni Mitchell's now appearing at The 2nd Fret, and Joni's gonna stay around for, erm, a week, is that what it is?
Another week, yeah
Joni, do you erm, are you tuned up, or...?
Yes, I'm all set, and I've got my little list of requests, and they requested all the ones that I wanted to do anyway, haha
Yeah. Joni's gonna try and make this show next week when Gordon - we're gonna have an all Canadian night herе next Sunday evening. Gordon Lightfoot will bе in, at the main point, and Joni will still be around, you know, at The 2nd Fret, so we're gonna try to, erm, have Joni and Gordon on at the same time. Joni Mitchell, erm, our listeners will remember is the err, author, composer... What is it I guess you call yourself, are you author no? Authoress?
Author, composer
Of erm, "The Urge For Going" (I wrote this song) and "The Circle Game" and erm, what's that song about the city? "Night In The City"?
"Night In The City"
"Night In The City", and I, I've heard you've written a lot of new things that you're doing now
Oh yes
Talk to-
I've written about, I think about, ten or a dozen songs since I was here last
Wanna do some of the requested songs, or?
Let's see, what have we got here? "Night In The City", "Circle Game", "All From Both Sides Now", I'm really glad that somebody requested that because that's a very new song and I've been driving everybody crazy by playing the song three times a night
Which one?
It's called "From Both Sides Now"
Ah
And...
I haven't heard that one
I'll play that one first. It erm, I should tell people a little bit about it. I was reading a book, and I haven't finished it yet, called "Henderson The Rain King", and there's a line in it that I especially got hung up on that was about when he was flying to Africa and searching for something, he, he said that, in an age when people could look up and down at clouds, they shouldn't be afraid to die. And so I got this idea from both sides now; there are a lot of sides to everything, and erm, and this song is called "From Both Sides Now"
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribblе addresses too sloppy when I jot 'еm
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, "No."
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. we should be together too
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Mister "I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans"
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
You dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you damn..
Capacitor

A capacitor is a component of electronic equipment that has the property of storing electrical energy in an electrical field. It consists of two terminals and is a passive component. The effect of a capacitor is known as capacitance





Motor Capacitors



A motor capacitor is an electrical capacitor that tends to alter the current to one of the windings of a single-phase AC motor to create a magnetic field, which can rotate. Generally, motor capacitors are of two types-

Run Capacitors

Start Capacitors



Applications of Motor Capacitors- Air conditioners, jacuzzi spa pumps, powerеd gates, heat-furnaces, or largе fans


Start Capacitors

Start capacitors are used to increase motor starting torque, through which the motor can be cycled on and off instantly. A start capacitor stays for a long time in a circuit and brings the motor up to a predetermined speed, which is 75% of its full speed. Then, it is removed from the circuit through a centrifugal switch



After this, a run capacitor is required for a motor to work more efficiently

Start capacitors work on ratings above 70 micro-F. Start capacitors, which work on ratings above 20 micro-F, are said to be non-polarized aluminium electrolytic capacitors. They consist of non-solid electrolytes, so; they are applicable only for short motor starting times



The centrifugal switch is the most important component. The motor will not work properly if the switch is damaged or broken. If the centrifugal switch is always on, the motor will not start, and the capacitor is not part of the circuit. If the centrifugal switch is always off, the motor windings will burn out, and the capacitor will be inside the circuit





Run Capacitors



Run capacitors are used in single-phase AC electric motors, to energize the second-phase windings so that a rotating magnetic field can be created while running the motor


These capacitors are specially designed for continuous working while the motor is powered, and that's why electrolytic capacitors are not used

Usually, run capacitors are polypropylene film capacitors, which are energized throughout the working of the motor. They are rated from 1.5 to 100 micro F. If the capacitance value of the installed capacitor is wrong, then an uneven magnetic field will be created around the rotor. It can lead the rotor to cause hesitation at uneven points, which further leads to irregular rotation. The hesitation of the rotor causes the motor to become noisy, the energy consumption of the motor is increased. Therefore, the overall performance of the motor is dropped and leads the motor to overheat





Safety Issues Of Motor Capacitors



Heat- The motor capacitor can overheat if it is defective because it is a component of a hot tub circulating pump. In this case, a fire hazard can be seen



Toxic- Most of the capacitors are made of polychlorinated biphenyls. These are toxic chemicals that possess many long-lasting negative human and wildlife health effects. So, there is a need for replacing these types of capacitors

Lyrics from snippet

[Verse: Matt Champion]
That boy on the motorcycle gon' get slap
Try picking 

[?]
At the next stop he gon slide it out and 

[?]

[Intro]
(The fuck?)

[Refrain]
You got a Slurpee for free
I caught you lookin' at me in the 7-Eleven
Under fluorescent lights

[Verse 1]
We walked in comfy silence
Footsteps down familiar sidewalk
Knowing that we were here in our dreams last night

[Chorus]
All my ghosts are with me
I know you feel them too
Ridin’ shotgun next to your free Slurpee
They know all of my habits, but they don't know about you
I hope that's true
Mmm
Mmm, hmm

[Verse 2]
We made sangria and failed
I spilled mac and cheese on my pants
And thought about kissing you underneath kitchen lights

[Chorus]
Oh, all my ghosts are with me
I know you feel them too
Oh, did you stand there while wе were takin’ shots of brandy?
They know all of my habits, but thеy don't know about you
I hope that's true

[Bridge]
I can see it now
The wedding of the year
I can see it now
He stands up there and wipes his tears
I can see it now
When all my ghosts disappear
I can see it crystal clear

[Refrain]
You got a Slurpee for free
I caught you lookin' at me in the 7-Eleven
Under fluorescent lights

[Chorus]
And all my ghosts were with me
I know you felt them too
Watchin' as I started to get dizzy
'Cause I hate all of my habits
But I happen to love you
I hope that's true

[Outro]
(Fuck yeah, hahahaha, fuck yeah, hahahaha)

[Intro: Funkmaster Flex]
Yeah... okay? Let's go, why not?
Funk Flex, Kendrick Lamar, HOT 97, HOT97.COM InFlexWeTrust.com
This is kinda chunky, ha ha

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Um, yeah, tell 'em put my name on a blimp
Ball like I'm Derrick Rose, ho, know my gym
You playa's not allowed I'm spikin' your game towel
And hittin' your Gatorade with gasoline I'm foul
I'm in the crowd like Artest and them
I move the crowd like Artest and them
Punchlines mean I really go punch civilians
Crunch time mean I take it to the hole
Not this basket but rather the good p*ssy that I'm in
I assassin you niggas, I make your weight turn thin
Blank tapes to your deck, niggas still brеak their neck
To hear it you need clеarance with the label just to win
I need to clear it with the bank just to spin
Club appearance that's 15 racks when you get it like that, shit, it's gotta be a sin
Lord forgive me, yes I'm a sinner
But these hoes squeeze me cause I'm a winner
Back when we ate canned food for dinner
I coach fools to ProTools make my agenda
I show fools, I'm tofu nasty, I wish a
Motherf*cker would get your whole career injured
That's assault what a deadly weapon
I killed your favorite rapper, favorite rapper last record
I f*cked your baby actress on the map just what a blessing
Make that p*ssy ante up she made my d*ck anti-depressive
I'm really not impressed with, none of you niggas stressing
That's some of you niggas bless with the gift to carry the presence
Of B.I.G & 'Pac and I'm popping big shit with label investments
15 minutes turn into 60 seconds
Last week, I spit 12 hours inside of session
Came up with shit writers block niggas up in here stressing
Like who the fuck cares? Who the fuck cares?
Even if you get slumped, dawg, you'll still be a millionaire
Niggas play a Santa Claus and make sure you hold dear
Every verse I put that bitch in the hearse, while Flex steer
Uh Church to you pussies, you push me get pap smeared
Burst out your cookie, I read it, my fortune is here

[Outro: Funkmaster Flex]
You Know what it is, HOT 97, Funk Flex, Kendrick Lamar
It is what it is, aight, arggggh

There's nothing else to find out

[Verse 1]
How poetic was the free land?
Couldn't have been a better place for it all to end
Everybody dies, but not everybody really lives

[...]

[Chorus]

There's nothing else to find out

[Verse 2]
Ain't like when you're home
Don't like when you're gone
Can't stand when you're home...

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna take my mind off you
Please, take me home and kiss me slow
And do anything you want to
Run your hand through my hair
It's okay to be rough
I'm a little bit tougher
Than all of your other girlfriends

[Chorus]
But you're not allowed
She's got you under lock and chain
Too late to let her down
So you're not allowed
What a shame it would be if you left her now
Now

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna take my mind off you
Please, make me laugh and kiss me back
And do everything you want to
Push me up against the wall
It's okay to be rough
I can handle this stuff
Only if you're comfortable

[Chorus]
But you're not allowed
She's got you under lock and chain
Too late to let her down
So you're not allowed
What a shame it would be if you left her now

[Chorus: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
Fame is the cocaine, but the clout is the crystal meth
Hate is the propane, fuel the fire, I'mma be the best
If it's insulting, then why the vaccine go left?
This is insulting, maybe I just go left

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
Rush in the church, pastor told me
“Yeezy walk on water, what you doing here, homie?”
Same thing, same thing, same control
Same thing, same shit, different cologne
Same plug, same song, same clothes
Same Jordans, it's thirty years fuckin' old
I took the 'Gram off for six months, what did I miss?
“Comе on, Yeezy, you know you ain't miss shit”

[Chorus: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
Fame is the cocaine, but thе clout is the crystal meth
Hate is the propane, fuel the fire, I'mma be the best
If it's insulting, then why the vaccine go left?
This is insulting, maybe I just go left

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
Get you up out that OshKosh B'gosh
Made my first billion 'cause A-di-das
Understood fifty percent of who I was
Don't provoke him, the godfather has spoken
Now who I'm is, got four kids
That was that, this is this
It's a wrap with the miss
"Come on, Yeezy, you know you built this shit"

[Chorus: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
Fame is the cocaine, but the clout is the crystal meth
Hate is the propane, fuel the fire, I'mma be the best
If it's insulting, then why the vaccine go left?
This is insulting, maybe I just go left

[Verse 1]
I get high out the window
And I don't tell my mom
I mix you with my vodka
And it turns me on

[Chorus]
There's a hole in my heart and I can't find the bullet
But you sleep with the firearm
I should've pulled it on you
What a shame, I can see it all
Now that we're through

[Verse 2]
I get drunk with my friends
Your name never comes up
I tell strangers online
That we broke up

[Chorus]
There's a hole in my heart and I hate that it's there
'Cause I liked to act like I really don't care
But I do
What a shame that I put up with you

[Bridge]
What a joke, was it all just an act?
I hate that it took me so long to react
You had me convinced that you loved me
What a fucked up reality show
Was it fame or the lack thereof?
I just don't know
You had me convinced that you loved me, oh

[Verse 3]
I'm not sure you realize
The pain that you caused
I don't feel like talking
But everyone else does

[Chorus]
There's a hole in my heart and I can't find the bullet
But you sleep with the firearm
I should've pulled it on you
Now I don't have the energy to

[Verse]
I hold my anger in my stomach
And I'm starting to have side effects
From hating you this much
No explanation, just a quote in a magazine
Where you said you only dated me for fun
And I'm paraphrasing now
But the gist of it was how you never loved me
Only in it for the sex
And I really don't get how
You can say that and be proud of it
We both know you were in deeper than that

[Chorus]
Nobody likes a secret
And I was always yours
It's almost been a year
And even so
I still don't know what for

[Verse 1]
Guns drawn, slow down
It's a battle over something stupid
They're all the rage right now
You don't know the truth
It's a battle that I think I'm winning
Something makes me think you think that too

[Pre-Chorus]
I was trying to be honest
You don't make that easy to do

[Chorus]
It's not that important
It's none of your concern
But you got angry
And said some angry words
It's not that I hate you
I hate that it hurt
There's nothing else to it
I can't do anything more, mm

[Verse 2]
Sharp knife, loaded gun
There are two ways we can do this
I know which would be more fun
I won't go first, won't apologize
Pretty sure that it's an ego thing
But I can't stand a compromise

[Pre-Chorus]
I was trying to be honest
But now I think I should've just liеd

[Chorus]
It's not that important
It's none of your concern
But you got angry
And said some angry words
It's not that I hatе you
I hate that it hurt
There's nothing else to it
I can't do anything more, mm

[Outro]
Ooh-oh, I was trying to be honest
If this is what I get, I won't be honest anymore
Oh, if this is what I get
I swear I won't be honest anymore

[Verse 1]
I called you again
I don't know why I keep on
Thinking that we're friends
'Cause we don't really talk anymore
And I'm sorry for that
Honestly I never really loved you that bad

[Chorus]
And I could be the end of it
But I never know when to stop talking
So I make my bed and sleep in it alone
'Cause I never know when we're done talking
If I don't love you, then why

[Verse 2]
Did I call you again?
I think that I was lonely
And I missed having friends
Now we don't really talk anymore
And it's good for us both
'Cause I know you love me the most

[Chorus]
And I should be the end of it
But I never know when to stop talking
So I make my bed and sleep in it alone
'Cause I never know when we're done talking
And I should be the end of it
But I never know when to stop talking (When to stop talking)
So I make my bed and sleep in it alone
'Cause I never know when we're done talking
You're better off on your own

[Bridge]
But you called me again
I don't know why it never seems to end
Now we don't really talk anymore
And it makes sense
'Cause all I do is hurt you
All I do is hurt you
All I do is cause you pain

[Outro]
'Cause I called you again

[Verse 1: Lizzy McAlpine]
I've been having strange dreams
Seeing ghosts and breaking things
Room's on fire as I sit and watch it melt around me
I've been hosting screenings
Of slightly altered movie scenes
Seems familiar 'til I realize that they look just like me

[Pre-Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine]
Where am I? I can't find the door
How long have you been here for?
Where the houses all can talk
And I don't mind the creaky floors

[Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine]
And now we're in a basement
I feel wasted and I'm sure
That you'll kiss me anyway
That'll be just the thing to wake me

[Post-Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine]
Maybe I'm weird or maybe I'm off the wall
But maybe it's weirder not to have dreamed at all

[Verse 2: Laura Elliott]
I can walk through walls now
Quietly I roam the halls
Suddenly I'm ten feet tall and I can touch the ceiling
I think I scared you off now
I'm regretting getting close hoping
It was just a ghost that sorta looked just like you

[Pre-Chorus: Laura Elliott]
Where am I? I can't find the door
How long have I been here for?
Where the houses all can talk
And I don't mind the creaky floors

[Chorus: Laura Elliott]
And now I'm in a maze
Down in this basement and I'm sure
That you'll miss me anyway
That'll be just the thing to wake me

[Post-Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine & Laura Elliott]
Maybe I'm weird or maybe I'm off the wall
But maybe it's weirder not to have dreamed at all
Maybe I'm weird or maybe I'm off the wall
But maybe it's weirder not to have dreamed at all

[Verse 1]
I see chemtrails in the sky, but I don't see the plane
What the hell is my problem with taking the blame?
'Cause I play with my food and then someone else takes it away
It's so hard to believe, but I'm trying to change

[Verse 2]
I see lines in the sand, but I don't see who made them
I still listen to that band that you showed me last April
I still play with my food, I'm a child at the grown-up's table
It's so hard to believe, but right now, I feel stable

[Chorus]
I moved away and I grew a few inches
What a shame, I had a chance and I missed it
And there are some days when I hear that song
And I hate to admit  it
But I miss it, I do
Oh, I miss it, I miss you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I miss it, I miss it, I miss you
Oh, oh
Oh, I miss it, I miss it, I miss you

[Verse 3]
I see chemtrails in the sky, but I don't see the plane
I know that I feel it, but I don't know the name
I play with my food and then I throw it away
So hard to believe I have to grow up this way

[Chorus]
I moved out and I made some new friends
Sometimes when I shout, it feels like no one hears it
And there are some days when I think that, somewhere, you're watching
As I grow up without you
I miss it, I miss you
(Here is Elizabeth eating a big snack after being in the shower for fifteen minutes)
I miss it, I miss you (She's famished, you can tell)
(Say goodnight)
(Goodnight)

[Verse 1]
Every guy at this festival has you in their eyes
I never think about it too much, but I'm thinking tonight
And it's really annoying that I'm triggered like this
'Cause your name isn't spoken, but I'm speaking it
And I don't know why it happened, but it happened like this

[Pre-Chorus]
My best friends are with me and I feel okay
The last time I was here, I was eighteen
My mind is racing and I feel so strange
Last time I was here, you were with me

[Chorus]
I fell in love at the Orange Show Speedway
It didn't look like this three years ago
I had it all at the Orange Show Speedway
Or someplace like that, it all looks the same
Everything changes, what a shame

[Verse 2]
I'm in the middle of the crowd and it's like no time's passed
I'm half-expecting you to be there when I turn to my left
We were stupid and young and I was so in love
We were just friends riding on the line between acceptable
And angering your girlfriend

[Pre-Chorus]
My best friends are with me and I feel okay
The last time I was here, I was eighteen
My mind is racing and I feel so strange
Last time I was here, you were with me

[Chorus]
I fell in love at the Orange Show Speedway
It didn't look like this three years ago
I had it all at the Orange Show Speedway
Or someplace like that, it all looks the same
Everything changes, what a shame

[Break]
Uh, yep, ooh, fireworks
This is the best voice memo diary to date I think (This is amazing)
Just wanted to update myself
No one else listens to these but myself
(Hey), okay (You got the fireworks if you put that in a song)

[Outro]
I fell in love at the Orange Show Speedway
But I've never been here in my life
I think it all kinda feels like an Orange Show Speedway
When you're racing head-first towards something that'll kill you in five seconds flat
When I'm racing head-first towards everything that I want back
I know a boy
He looks like a sin
But he smells like whisky
His mouth tastes like gin
He's caring and compassionate
But doesn't ever show it
I wanna know what goes through his mind

I know that boy
He can sometimes be a handful
He loves a lot of things
And I would like to know about them, too
So let me in
And I'll show you
What makes me different from you
I'll show you everything
That makes you, you
Ooo
We'll reimagine
All the things we thought we knew
Just me and you
We'll fly (fly by)
Fly away (fly away)
From all the things that we carry
Things that we share
And wish that would give way
We'll fly (fly by)
Fly away (fly away)
Two lonely people
With nothing to lose (nothing to lose)
And everything to gain
Ohhh
Da da da da da da da da da
Won't you
Give me a smile
Da da da da da da da da da
Won't you
Stay with me for a while
She was a diamond
In a sea of storms
Her brown eyes
Are finally shimmering on their own
She knew, she knew, she knew
That she would be okay

For a moment
Time stopped
For a moment
It was just her
And the things on that mountaintop
She knew, she knew, she knew
That everything was okay

Oooh
This girl
She was fragile
And so it seemed
She only showed the side of her
That people wanted to see
She wanted to see the world
But was trapped in a cocoon
So she hacked a rocket ship
Headed straight for the moon
It's unforgivable

[?]
I am lately (?)
I feel like i'm goin crazy
I felt invincible
When you saved me
I thought maybe
We could be more than a phase
We weren't together very long
Maybe that's what went wrong
I have fallen too fast
And you got caught in the act
Why did you have to go and lie to me
Could've just confronted me
Didn't have to let me go that fast

I know you know
That I know that I was just a rebound
Not anything real
I shouldn't be waiting (waiting)
Or pacing (or pacing)
Or thinking that you've changed
For real
And I know that you're still in love with her
Even after all of the things that she did
You just can't help it
You ditched me
And acted like you didn't even care
I don't know how we got here
But my fear that 

[?]
Mmmm
I live my life in 

[?]
Apparently you wanted back in my life (?)
I'm turning all the tables now
You don't think I'm able to forget you
But honey I might
You think I'm innocent
Harmless
Just a little child
But baby
I fight
You know I'm one of a kind

Hey, boy, what is this I see?
Your girl – she looks just like me
Blond hair and dressed to a T
You tell me how can this be
Does she know I was the one
Who used to turn you on
Yeah
But you don't want to talk about it

Well you think you can find
Someone to fill my shoes
And you ask yourself why
She don't do the things I do
And you can't deny
That everywhere you go
You see my face, hear my name
And it eats you up inside

You know I'm one of a kind
There'll never be another me
Can't get me out of your mind
You're lost in your own fantasy
And when you look in my eyes
Is it hard for you to realize
She'll never be me
Why can't you see it girl?
Got no identity
Whenever he's touching you
He's really thinking of me
Do you know I am the one
Who used to turn him on, yeah
But you don't want to talk about it

And the way you must feel
You got to be confused
And you ask yourself why
You can't do the things I do
And you can't deny
That everywhere you go
You see my face, hear my name
And it eats you up inside

You know I'm one of a kind
There'll never be another me
Can't get me out of your mind
You're lost in your own fantasy
And when you look in my eyes
Is it hard for you to realize
She'll never be me

Don't you think that she would see through you
But you don't want to think about it
Try so hard to do the things I do
But you don't want to think about it
You know I'm one of a kind
There'll never be another me
Can't get me out of your mind
You're lost in your own fantasy
And when you look in my eyes
Is it hard for you to realize
She'll never be me

You know I'm one of a kind
There'll never be another me
Can't get me out of your mind
You're lost in your own fantasy
And when you look in my eyes
Is it hard for you to realize
She'll never be me

She'll never be me
I can't wait to take you around the world
With me
I can't wait for you to get back home
So we can pack up and leave
I don't know why this scares me so much
I've been through this before
Maybe I'm realizing that this is nothing like before
But something about this is different
Now I know for sure
It's crashing down on me
Like a wave hits the shore

I'm packing up my pieces
Letting it all fly with the wind
For you, for you
I'll feel
But so what
Who cares
If I'm just throwing my life away
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
And home will always be
Home will always be
Waiting for me
When I get back homе
When I, When I, when I
Gеt back home
I can't wait for magical stardust in the sky
One of these days
I'll pack up and start a new life
Hey, you over there
Why don't you come over here
Tell me about your dreams
I'll tell you about my schemes
Are you afraid
Scared of wanderlust
Don't break the news
Let's just adjust

I'm packing up my pieces
Letting it all fly with the wind
For you, for you
I'll feel
But so what
Who cares
If I'm just throwing my life away
Il'll be with you
I'll be with you
And home will always be
Home will always be

Packing up my pieces
Letting it all fly with the wind
For you, for you
It's always for you
But so what
Who cares
If I've thrown my life away
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
And home will always be
Home will always be
Waiting
How do I know
When it's time to let go
I keep living in a daydream
And I can't find my way home
Did I miss a sign
Was there something I needed to find
Lost and confused
I write my feelings on paper
In the form of a song
Like this will help me along
I don't know where we went wrong
Can't get out of bed
I am stuck in my own head
I need to write a new song

I don't know where you went
But it's somewhere I can't get to
Why do you insist on living like this
Why won't you let me find you
Help me
Let me remind you
What we had was innocent
But carеful and strong
What we had was great
But now it's gone
Oo-oo-oo-oo
Yеah

You are replaceable
And boy I'm unbreakable
Can't shoot me down
I won't surrender now
In the form of a song
Like this will help me along
I don't know where we went wrong

Only trying to help tore apart whatever we felt
Now it's gone
I don't know where you went
But it's somewhere I can't get to
Why do you insist on living like this
Why won't you let me find you
Help me
Let me remind you
What we had was innocent
But careful and strong
What we had was great
But now it's gone
Oh, now it's gone
Lyrics from Snippet

[The Kid LAROI]
...
Don't take my kindness for a weakness, bitch, you geekin'

Honest and Christian, where I'm from, I'm like Jesus
The prayers be to God, I wake up, I thank the Lord
We done been through it all, I'm the one

[Fivio Foreign]
Uh, we all want recognition
You say I'm a demon, what is the definition?
Uh, you say...

[Verse 1]
Say you wanna leave, leave, leave me
Well, darling I'll set you free
Though I can’t forget
There'll be no regret

[Chorus]
Oh, so much joy, hey, yeah (Sweet love and joy)
Love and joy (Sweet love and joy)
Sweet loving and joy (Sweet love and joy)
You gave to me (Sweet love and joy)

So long, so long, so long, so long, so long
(So long, so long, so long, so long, so long)
Gee, I hate to see those eyes
(So long, so long, so long, so long, so long)
There's nothing left for me to give

Except for memories of you
(So long, so long, so long, so long, so long)

[Chorus]
Oh, there's so much joy, yeah, yeah (Sweet love and joy)

More than anyone else

So long, so long, so long, so long, so long
(So long, so long, so long, so long, so long)
Gee, I tried to carry on

There's nothing left for me to give
(So long, so long, so long, so long, so long)
Than keep the memories of you
(So long, so long, so long, so long, so long)

[Outro]
Oh, your love and joy, joy, joy, joy (Sweet love and joy)

You got a lot of baggage girl, it's hard to handle

But now (now)
You're so far away and I'm down (Down)
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified-ied-ied-ied

[Chorus]
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep, and I
I could bе the reason you can't sleep at night
A messagе in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you

[Verse 2]
These days I'm restless
Workdays are endless, look how you made me (Made me)
But time moves faster, replaying your laughter, disaster

Feelin' like a face in the crowd

[Outro]
You could be the one that I love
You could be the one that I love, I love
And now I'm standin' here, hopin' this gets to you

[Verse 1]
I'm reflecting light
Play it on the wall
Did see you looking
I'm not interested
And you seem kind
And you were ready to show me

[Chorus]
Constellation of love
I know that dream
It can't be real
And where do you come from?

[Verse 2]
I guess I could try
Did seem aligned
Look through the window
I see reflections that you can't see
Phasing me inside

[Pre-Chorus]
I need the space of mind
And you're running out of time
You won't believe that

[Chorus]
I wish I knew every part of you
Through this lonely night

[Verse 1]
We sold out our souls, for rock and roll
Spend all my cash, till my teeth turn gold
Cigarettes I smoke, just to keep me going, and I'm gone
So I don't think I'm ever coming down
So I don't think I'm ever coming down
Easy now

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
We sold out our souls, for rock and roll
Spend all my cash, till my teeth turn gold

Easy now

[Intro]
Bongo by the way
Woo

[Verse 1]
Niggas wrapped around the planet
Got me feeling like I'm Janet and it's 1984 (Uh, huh)
Got 'em all in a panic
All this body that I'm giving
Got 'em coming up with different strokes
Been doing shows since high school
To the mall, then record in the mic booth
Tryna get on just like you
Don't chase the money, be humble
And let it find you

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I can't tell you what to do (No)
I can't tell you how to move (No, no)
No, I can't tell you what to do
I can't tell you how to move (I move)
I know your thinking that you might know what it is
Still have no idea
'Cause when you finally understand just what it is
Still have no idea

[Chorus]
What's love
These days
Wе don't know what to say
Heartbreak
So much
We don't givе a fuck, no

[Verse 2]
Around the corner where X lived
In the school street projects
Cursin' out my exes (Motherfucker, kiss my ass, bitch)
Niggas was dying for less than
Thank God that we made it out the hood
What a blessing
Never know what they might do
Niggas pretending they living a double life too
I ain't never been the type to
Talk about some shit I never really been through

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I can't tell you what to do (No-ooh, oh)
I can't tell you how to move (I can't)
No, I can't tell you what to do (No)
I can't tell you how to move
I know your thinking that you might know what it is
Still have no idea
'Cause when you finally understand just what it is
(You still don't have no) Still have no idea

[Chorus]
What's love
These days
We don't know what to say
Heartbreak
So much

Yeah
Love will never, love will never, love
Yeah-ayy, hey

[Verse 1]
Shuttin' 'em down like we're supposed to
Only make love to the one I'm close to
Celibate, I make you my go-to
I'll do it again this time without you
Don't deny the part when you lied and I cried
But tonight I switched up something
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Drowning in my mind, love won't feel the same again (Oh, yeah)
Things I sacrificed (Things I sacrificed)
Just to feel something again (Just to feel something again)
Love won't feel thе same

Love will nevеr, love will never, love (Love will never)
Love will never, love will never, love (Love, oh-oh)

Trying my hardest not to want you
But I'll thug it out, so I won't go through
Another heartbreak falling for you
So this is the way I have to move
Don't deny the part
When you lied and I cried
But tonight I switched up something, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Drowning in my mind, love won't feel the same again (Won't feel the same again, oh, yeah)
Things I sacrificed (Things I sacrificed)

Love won't feel the same again

[Bridge]
No, no
I've been trying
But I'm tired (Ooh, ooh)
I ain't got nothing else to say
What I gave to you (What I gave to you)
Boy, you played with it
I was a gift you should have treasured every day
Love will never (Love will never)
Love will never
Love won't feel the same again
Never be the same (Oh-ooh)

Drowning in my mind (Drowning in my mind), love won't feel the same again

Bumper to bumper like LA in traffic

Who gon' direct you with all them theatrics?
But of course

[Chorus: Anderson.Paak with Mary J. Blige]
Ain't that the way it's supposed to be?
'Pose to be, it's supposed to be? Yeah
Here with me, here with me, yeah
'Cause you're here with me (Wait)

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Like New York in traffic
I make the features and do all the casting
Who gon' direct me with all these theatrics?
But of course, go head and roll one
Ain't gotta pass it
I'll play the roll but this ain't no actin'
This show is over but we can't be cancelled
But of course

[Chorus: Anderson.Paak with Mary J. Blige, Mary J. Blige]
Ain't that the way it's supposed to be? ('Pose to be)
'Pose to be, it's supposed to be? Yeah ('Pose to be)
Here with me, here with me
'Cause you're here with me

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Give me more than sex, yeah, I need to connect
Don't wanna wake up in the morning feeling sad and regretful
Don't wanna press, but when it's us
Want you
But of course
Give me more than sex, yeah, I need to connect
Don't wanna wake up in the morning feeling sad and regretful
Don't wanna press, but when it's us
Want you to make me feel special
But of course

[Chorus: Anderson.Paak with Mary J. Blige]
Ain't that the way it's supposed to be?
'Pose to be, it's supposed to be? Yeah
Here with me, here with me, yeah
'Cause you're here with me

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
This isn't love, this is roulette
I just want back what I put into this
And then I'll keep movin'
All of my chips on the table
'Cause I never got what I came for
Not leaving 'til I am stable

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I spent everything on ya
Spent my energy on ya
Put that loyalty on ya
I ain't got nothing left
I'm in over my head
Now I'm barely breathing
You know you the reason
Just tryna break even
You must be used to me spending

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Look now my rent money due
I spent everything fuckin' with you, oh
They say you win some, you win some, you lose
All I got is rеnt money due
Fucking with you

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
I just want back what I came with
Ain't no sеnse throwing no shade
Pointing a finger in blame
I knew the risk
Soon as we kissed
Wasn't no even exchange
You treat everyone like they are famous
Every girl like she's the main chick, amazing

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I spent everything on ya
Spent my energy on ya
Put that loyalty on ya
I ain't got nothing left
I'm in over my head
Now I'm barely breathing
You know you the reason
Just tryna break even
You must be used to me spending

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Look now my rent money due
I spent everything fuckin' with you, oh
They say you win some, you win some, you lose
All I got is rent money due
Fucking with you

[Verse 3: Dave East]
Goddamn the rent money due
Tanqueray, spilling gin and juice
Feeling like I'm Snoop
Phone out, she recording
Just so she can get the proof
It was all good when we was in the mood
But I scratched that
Nothing on me regular
Louis Vuitton backpack
Shanks on she ain't got her own
She gotta match that
Focused on the future, I don't backtrack
That rent money due
I take credit, cash, debit, even CashApp
Fifties, we spendin' hundreds, we stash that
It's hard to trust them, I wanted to stab that
Now I'm just looking past that
I hope you got your own
No more asking me where your cab at
Asking me what I'm mad at
Smoking and then I pass that

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
What more do you want from me? (Want from me)
You can't help my sanity (No, no)
I gave you my best
There ain't nothing left
This can't be reality
I'm picking up the pieces of the puzzle
Here all by myself, yeah
I can't even wish you well

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Look now my rent money due
I spent everything fuckin' with you, oh
They say you win some, you win some, you lose
All I got is rent money due
Fucking with you

[Spoken Verse: Mary J. Blige & H.E.R.]
So, so I got this concept for this, right? (Mmm)
It's, it's like how I finally got a chance to say I'm amazing
I never said that in my life about myself, ever (Mmm)
I never thought it
But just recently in my life, I was like I'm amazing 'cause God said I'm amazing, I'm amazing
So, what I started doing along with that
Like, when I was going through all this bad shit in my life
I started waking up and saying, "Good morning, gorgeous"
Mmm, I like that
No matter what I was doing
No matter what I was going through
I look in the mirror, hungover, not hungover, mad, not mad, whatever
Always going through something and because of the thing playing in my head
About, you know, the way the person was chipping at me and tearing me down, tearing me down
And making me look at myself like I wasn't enough
And I just gave up and I just wanna say, "Good morning, gorgeous"
Wow, I love that
You should start the song off like that, I love everything...
That's the song

[Intro]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Now, now, baby
Anytime you want it
Talking 'bout a lifetime, only
You been filling all my needs in my me time
Then proceed to push the speed
There's no decline

[Pre-Chorus]
Come, come and see about me
You know I'm really in a good mood
I bought a coast for you
Match that so we can have two
Come, come and see about me
You know I'm really in a good mood
You make a move, I make a move
We make a movie

[Chorus]
'Cause we got some thing to do tonight
And you got a point to prove your pride
We bring color to black and white
What we just did could make a life
'Cause we got some things to do tonight

[Verse 2]
Somеthing 'bout your loving always keep me jumping
Pop one out the ovеn, watch me bake
When at your best, can never go wrong
You take the lead and keep it up front
Talking about a lifetime, only

[Pre-Chorus]
Come, come and see about me
You know I'm really in a good mood
I bought a coast for you
Match that so we can have two
Come, come and see about me
You know I'm really in a good mood
You make a move, I make a move
We make a movie

[Chorus]
'Cause we got some thing to do tonight
And you got a point to prove your pride
We bring color to black and white
What we just did could make a life
'Cause we got some things to do tonight

Got some things to do, oh (Tonight)

[Intro]
I'm so tired, don't wanna feel it
No, no, no, no, no
Talk about it

[Verse 1]
If I can pick the best parts of love, I would start it like this
I would start at the time we took our first trip
I would start at the time we had our first kiss
If I can pick the best parts of love, I can do without this
I would take out all the bullshit
I would take out the part about your ex-bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know how long I can wait
Oh, I don't know how much I can take
Oh, when will love give me a break?
Oh, I feel like I'm goin' insane

[Chorus]
I'm so goddamn sick of the pain
Wastin' all my time playin' so many games
Ups and downs, feel like I'm caught in the rain
I want love without the heartbreak

[Verse 2]
If I can pick the best parts of love, I would do it like this
I would start at the part when wе made love
All the flowеrs and cards just to make up
If I can pick the best parts of love, I'd do without this
I would take out the part when you changed up
I would take out the part when you gave up

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know how long I can wait (Don't know, I don't know)
Ooh, I don't know how much I can take
Oh, when will love give me a break?
I feel like I'm goin' insane

[Chorus]
I'm so goddamn sick of the pain (I'm so sick)
Wastin' all my time playin' so many games
Ups and downs, feel like I'm caught in the rain (Shit is makin' me sick)
I want love without the heartbreak

[Bridge]
Listen
I never claimed to be a genius
I lived long enough to see this
Thought it was love, but I was dreamin'
I wanna feel love without the heartbreak
I never claimed to be a genius (I never claimed to be a genius)
I lived long enough to see this (But I lived long enough to see this)
Thought it was love, but I was dreamin' (Thought it was love, but I was dreamin')
I wanna feel love without the heartbreak

[Chorus]
I'm so goddamn sick of the pain
Wastin' all my time playin' so many games
Ups and downs, feel like I'm caught in the rain
I want love without the heartbreak

[Verse 1]
So close to givin' up
When you stay, you're fuckin' up
When your prayers aren't enough and the tears don't work
I thought we were family, so you know how it hurts
I'm crazy about you
But that's not enough
From a boy to a man, still never grew up
I don't wanna feel this, don't wanna get stuck

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm in, I'm out
Can't get over you, no doubt
(Wish I) Wish I knew what I do now
Wouldn't keep the door open 'til you appear
Ooh, I'm passin' your house
Got me wantin' to burn it to the ground
(Damn, I) Wish I knew what I do now
But it wouldn't even save us

[Chorus]
And I keep failin' in love
How'd I lose it?
Feels like it's never enough
But I can't let it go
And I keep givin' my all
So tired, so tired, so tired
And I keep failin' in love
How'd I lose it?

[Verse 2]
Not gеttin' any rest
'Cause this love has been a hеadache (Yeah)
It used to be fun (Yeah), was your only one
It used to be feelings, now it's just a mess (Yeah)
Nobody really wins (Nobody)
When there's beef between me and you
'Cause I'ma do me (Yehah), and you gon' do you
And now it's a problem 'cause you don't approve

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm in, I'm out
Can't get over you, no doubt (No)
(Wish I) Wish I knew what I do now (I wish, I wish)
Wouldn't keep the door open 'til you appear
Ooh, I'm passin' your house
Got me wantin' to burn it to the ground
(Damn, I) Wish I knew what I do now
But it wouldn't even save us (No, no, no)

[Chorus]
And I keep failin' in love (I don't know what I do wrong)
How'd I lose it?
Feels like it's never enough (Feels like it's never, never, never)
But I can't let it go
And I keep givin' my all
So tired, so tired, so tired (I keep givin' my all)
And I keep failin' in love (I keep failin' in love)
How'd I lose it?

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh (We got London on the track)
I keep failin', I don't know what I'm doin' wrong, oh
Help me, I
Help me, I need to figure it out
Help me figure it out, yeah

[Intro]
Oh, yeah
Oh-oh, God
I don't care if it's...

[Verse 1]
I don't care if it's hard on me
I'd rather be lonely, go
Why would you even do me like that?
I know it's easy not to think about me when you're away
'Cause if you had me on your mind
You'd know that you won't ever hurt me

[Chorus]
Now tell me, why is it so typical to let it go?
Walk away for physical, forget the love
You can't see what you got at home
You're dead wrong not to fight for it
Tell me, why is it so typical to let it go?
Walk away for physical, forget the love (Yeah)
You can't see what you got at home
You're dead wrong not to fight for it
Is it ever gonna be enough?

[Verse 2]
I know the chase has got you feelin'
Like you don't need me no more
It's got you so delusional
I know it's easy not to think about me when you're away
'Cause if you had me on your mind
You'd know that you won't never hurt me

[Chorus]
Now tell me, why is it so typical to let it go? (Oh, yeah)
Walk away for physical, forget the love
You can't see what you got at home
You're dead wrong not to fight for it
Now tell me, why is it so typical to let it go? (Why you wanna let it go?)
Walk away for physical, forget the love (For physical)
You can't see what you got at home
You're dead wrong not to fight for it (You're dead wrong not to fight for it)
Is it ever gonna be enough?

[Bridge]
All the signs I ain't been readin'
The seven to five years of cheatin'
Now my insides are bleedin'
'Cause there's so much deceivin'
All the signs I ain't been readin' (All the signs)
The seven to five years of cheatin' (Yeah, yeah)
Now my insides are bleedin'
'Cause there's so much deceivin'

[Chorus]
Tell me, why is it so typical to let it go? (Why? Why?)
Walk away for physical, forget the love (Always physical)
You can't see what you got at home
You're dead wrong not to fight for it (You're dead wrong, you're dead wrong not to fight)
Now tell me, why is it so typical to let it go?
Walk away for physical, forget the love (Why? Why?)
You can't see what you got at home
You're dead wrong not to fight for it
Is it ever gonna be enough?

[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, mm, love

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
When you need love you can count on me
When you need love, I'm a call away
You can count on me
When you need love I'm here to stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
When you need love, though

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
Remind me how it feels waking up in a cloud of love
I'm looking for a tender touch, oh
But I'ma take my time, no rush
I like the way it feels to be free
It's about time, I got options, I won't lie
Don't want you to think my heart is cold
But I've been hurt before

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
And I just want someone to hold me close briefly
I need someone who knows I'm not the one to be controled
I may not stay, I may not go
Warning you now, don't get too close
'Causе you gon' miss me everytimе that I go
But I'ma give you something that you can hold
I'll stick around if you can play your hole
And when you

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
When you need love you can count on me
When you need love, I'm a call away
You can count on me
When you need love I'm here to stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
When you need love, though

[Verse 2: Usher]
Feels so good in the beginning
You're a pretty girl and you think you're winning
But when it wears off it's a bad ending
Don't mind holding you down if you keep your interest

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
I just want someone to hold me close briefly
I need someone who knows I'm not the one to be controled
I may not stay, I may not go
Warning you now, don't get too close
'Cause you gon' miss me everytime that I go
But I'ma give you something that you can hold
I'll stick around if you can play your hole
And you know that you

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige, Usher & both]
When you need love you can count on me
When you need love, I'm a call away
You can count on me (Count on me)
When you need love I'm here to stay (Need love to stay)
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay (Oh, oh)
When you need love, though (Real ones need love)
When you need love you can count on me (Count on me)
When you need love, I'm a call away (When you need love)
You can count on me (You can count on me, You can count on me, you can count on me)
When you need love I'm here to stay (Oh, stay, Stay, stay)
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
When you need love, though (Need love to stay, hey, yeah right away)

Anamnesis crashing through

Dream grips me and pulls me into
Global unparalleled new
Metamorphic is my name
Surrender this brain

Split dry sky beckons me through
A hand outstretched calls my name
Time to wake again

It's coming up, beach boys
It's gonna be a lot of fun
The water's getting deeper
It's gonna drown everyone
It's coming up, beach boys
The weather's getting messed about
You better bring boards down
The waves are bigger than a house

2.02, killer year
No fear, proceed without blame
No shame, playing games with lives unborn
No scorn, not torn between just and fucked up
We've stuffed up, time to pick up, up, up, up, up

It's coming up, beach boys
It's gonna be a lot of fun
The water's getting deeper

[Intro: Stu Mackenzie]
Bye-bye, Shanghai
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly

[Chorus: Stu Mackenzie]
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Bye-bye, Shanghai, bye-bye, my life
Born again overnight
(Born again overnight)
Bright light's up high, grey smog all the time

[Verse 1: Ambrose Kenny-Smith]
Okay, let me trace my steps
Pour a drink, let's recap the sequence
One minute, you're swigging on a green tea
Next minute, floating on a pillow in a den
From there, it gets a little hazy
Like a camera out of focus, shaking
Slow motion in the club, free-falling
Through my seat, hit the floor transforming
Undergoing complete metamorphous
From a moth caterpillar to a chrysalis
Spinning in a silken house, like a spider spins a web (Born again overnight)
I'm a well-known insect

[Break: Stu Mackenzie]
(Born again overnight)

[Chorus: Stu Mackenzie]
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Bye-bye, Shanghai, bye-bye, my life
Born again overnight
Born again overnight
Born again overnight
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly

[Post-Chorus: Stu Mackenzie]
Bye-bye, Shanghai
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly

[Drop]
Kick it

[Break: Stu Mackenzie]
Born again overnight

[Chorus: Stu Mackenzie]
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Bye-bye, Shanghai, bye-bye, my life
Born again overnight
Born again overnight
Bright light's up high, grey smog all the time

[Chorus: Stu Mackenzie]
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight
Bye-bye, Shanghai, bye-bye, my life
Born again overnight
Bright light's up high, dark thoughts in my mind
Born again overnight
Bright light's up high, grey smog all the time
Born again overnight
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight

[Chorus: Stu Mackenzie]
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Bye-bye, Shanghai, bye-bye, my life
Bright light's up high, dark thoughts in my mind
Bright light's up high, grey smog all the time
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly

[Verse: Ambrose Kenny-Smith]
Flying through the Yu Garden to the People's Square
That's where you find your happiness
With a little too much Szechuan in the pot
Sending sensational content
Neck stuck from looking up
At the high-rise buildings trying to caress
Enlightenment through an out-of-body experience
You're thriving in this environment
Come find me on almost every continent
Cold-blooded, but I can't stand the Antarctic
Guess I've been born again overnight

[Outro: Stu Mackenzie]
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born ag—
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterf—
Bye-bye, Shanghai, I've become a butterfly
Born again overnight

I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down
But wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around
And say

[Chorus]
That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize
It's too late, too late, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I'd take another chance
Take a fall, take a shot for you, oh, oh
I need you like a heart needs a beat
That's nothing new, yeah
I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turning blue
And you say
Sorry, like the angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

It's too late to apologize

I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were somethin' special
When you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again

[Verse 2]
I've got a way of knowin' when somethin' is right
I feel like I must've known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes

Now I can't wait to see you again

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you again

[Verse 3]
I got this crazy feelin' deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader, but I'm reading the signs

That you can't wait to see me again

Yeah, yeah, uh
Can you lie next to her
And give her your heart, your heart
As well as your body
And can you lie next to her
And confess your love, your love
As well as your folly
And can you kneel before the king
And say I'm clean, I'm clean

Tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart
Oh tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart

A white blank page and a swelling rage, rage
You did not think when you sent me to the brink, to the brink
You dеsired my attention but deniеd my affections, my affections

Tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart
Oh tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart
Lead me to the truth and I will follow you with my whole life
Lead me to the truth and I will follow you with my whole life
Lyrics from Snippet

No stormy nights or windy seas
Could separate lovе between you and me, mama
Oh, yes, happy go lucky you, happy go lucky me
We are happy go lucky
And we'll be always be happy go lucky

[Intro: Keedron Bryant]
Ooh, ooh
Keep my spirit alive
Keep my spirit alive, alive

[Chorus: Keedron Bryant & Kanye West]
More than enough
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
The spirit won't die, I—
Oh, oh, oh, my life (Yeah)
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize
(Lord have mercy)

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Yo
Flushed the work just in time and they raided, thank God (Thank God)
Screamin' through the GT roof like nigga, we done made it, thank God (Thank God)
Hundred-round drum didn't jam when my shooter tried to spray it, thank God (Thank God)
Couple thousand grams, got two thousand grands when we waited, thank God (Thank God)
I was facin' fifteen and I beat it (And I beat it)
Just spent about twenty up at Neimans (Up at Neimans)
Did two hundrеd in a Demon (In a Demon, skrrt)
I'm the illеst nigga and I mean it (And I mean it)
My homie droppin' bodies for no reason (Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
Now his kids see him on the weekends (Ah)
Got the baking soda for the remix (Remix)
Millionaires on, I can see it

[Chorus: Keedron Bryant & Kanye West]
I got more than enough
I can face the world with the Lord on my side
Spirit won't die, I—
Oh, oh, oh, my life (Yeah)
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize
(Lord have mercy)

[Verse 2: Conway the Machine]
Yeah, don't hate me, 'cause my heart is full of love
No weapon formed against me 'cause I'm covered in the blood
Layin' in the hospital when I got shot, fam
Mama prayed for me, said she left it in God's hands, yeah
So I'ma leave it in God's hands
Everything I'm doin' now is God's plan
Doctor said I wouldn't walk no more, now I stand
Then I ran, here I am, Machine

[Chorus: Keedron Bryant]
Keep my spirit alive
Keep my spirit alive, alive
More than enough
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Keedron Bryant]
Well, between a mix of bad schools with the fast food (The spirit won't die, I—)
Bad had tools and a bad mood
If you don't turn to a lil' Gotti, they gon' drain all the strength in your lil' body (Oh, oh, oh, my life, yeah)
They turned me into a lil' Gotti, uh, yeah (Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize, Lord have mercy)
Not Wakanda but Wakanda is kinda like what we 'bout to make
And who gon' make it? Kan', duh
Who the squad? Donda
Who the mom? Donda
Who can see? Don, duh, get Don C
M.I.B., I told L.V. like Farrakhan told me
You can take the V, it still won't cure the disease (My life, yeah)
Uh, still won't cure the disease, still won't cure—yeah

[Chorus: Keedron Bryant]
More than enough
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side

[Verse 4: Kanye West, Royce da 5'9", & Keedron Bryant]
You're more concerned about raising your next round than raising your next child (The spirit won't die)
Here’s the exodus on the one you exiled
We won't panic in a pandemic, we can stand in it
Believe in the word, know the spirit is transcendent
People who stress you out, my vision clear without it (Spirit won't die)
But it's y'all, I swear I’m sorry to hear about it
I'm not sorry it happened
I’m just sorry to hear about it (I mean)
The best decision on your worst mistake (The spirit won't die)
Every day’s a song, it only takes the hook to break, you know
Headed back to Cody and the first thing's smokin'
I'ma get a room, it's the first thing open, brr—yeah
Step into the sanctuary (The spirit won't die)
You gon' thank me so much, I had to start a thank-tuary
Tell the assassins I escaped from Calabasas
Where they wanna turn my wife to Jackie Jo Jackson
Jackie Robinson, we had that (The spirit won't die)
When the World Cup Series and that’s just us practicin', but—
Who needs practice? I don't do rehearsals
And I don't do commercials, 'cause they too commercial
Give it all to God and let Jesus reimburse you (The spirit won't die)
She said "You in the studio with who? I'ma hurt you"
How I'm forty-two and you got a curfew?
How nerves dictate how they gon' curve you?
Quiet all the cordialness
We walk in God's spiritual ordinance
We know the Blacks, the orphans refused to be runaways
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid (Lord on my side, The spirit won’t die)

[Chorus: Keedron Bryant]
More than enough
I can face the world with the Lord on my side

[Verse 5: Kanye West, Royce da 5'9", & Keedron Bryant]
My puffer so puffy, you would've thought it was Sean John (The spirit won't die, I—)
Over the vintage suit my dad wore to my Mom's prom
Go home to the wifey to avoid the Rom-coms
How you break the net and go to sleep in Mom Johns?
Summer basketball camp down in Maryland
Used to play it with the Terrapins (Lord, have mercy)
Used to play it with the Taliban
How the police officer will view a fellow African
That DC crossover had me feelin' arrogant
But I got scopophobia, don't stare at him
My favorite intern worked somewhere else for more cheese
But I can't cry over spilled milk employees (The spirit won’t die)
Satan has Helen Keller’d the people
Until we all agree he a liar, we ain't equal
Brought souls to HOV, now bring the souls to JAY-Hovah (The spirit won’t die)
Raised in the cold, Thank God I'm bipolar
I wouldn't do a Doc on Mike, I'm not Oprah
Drenched in the blood, I'm not what ya' call sober
I followed in the word and did what the Lord told us (The spirit won’t die)
Now I’ve got the culture back on my shoulders (Lord, have mercy)

[Chorus: Keedron Bryant & Kanye West]
I can face the world with the Lord on my side
The spirit won't die, I—
Oh, oh, oh, my life (Yeah)
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize (Lord, have mercy)
More
Than the greatest love
The whole wide world has known
Darling, this is the love I'm gonna give you
To you, you alone

Well, More
Than the simple words
The little things I try to say
Darling, I'm gonna love you, love you
More each day

More
Than you'll ever know
Sugar, my arms long to hold you so
Darling, my life will be in your keeping
Waking, sleeping, honey, laughing, weeping

Longer than always
I know that's a pretty long time
But far beyond forever
Well, I know, I know you'll be mine
I know I never
Darling, I never lived before
And my heart, my heart is so sure
No one else could love you More

[Verse 1: Kanye West & KayCyy]
Keep my spirit alive
We must now realise the promise of America by trusting God
Keep my spirit alive, alive
Unifying our vision, and building the future, know what I mean?
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
Well, between a mix of bad schools with the fast food
The spirit won't die, die
Bad had tools and a bad mood
Oh, oh, my life
If you don't turn to a lil' Gotti, they gon' drain all the strength in your lil' body
It's in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize
They turned me into a lil' Gotti, uh, yeah
(The spirit won't die, God on my side)

You can take it all, but the Lord on my side

[Verse 2: Kanye West, Royce da 5'9", & KayCyy]
Y'all more concerned about raisin' your next round than raisin' your next child

Believe in the word, know the spirit is transcendent

People who stress you out, my vision clear without it (The spirit won't die)
But it's y'all, I swear I’m sorry to hear about it
I'm not sorry it happened
I'm just sorry to hear
I'm either the best decision, or your worst mistake
Every day's a song, it only takes the hook to break, you know
Headed back to Cody on the first thing smokin'
I'ma get a room at the first thing open, brr-ah
Step into the sanctuary
You gon' thank me so much, I had to start a thank-tuary

That DC crossover had me feelin' arrogant
But I got scopiphobia, don't stare at him
Favorite intern worked somewhere else for more cheese
But I can't cry over spilled milk employees
Back up, back up, back up this the main event
I saw Cassie trainer, and my girl ain’t had a male trainer since
(More than enough)
I need an estate plan with an escape plan
Just in case I'm ambushed by Mr. Fake Tan
(You can take it all, but the Lord on my side)
You are an example of someone who ain’t prayin’
(The spirit won't die, die)
You a sinner, all orange like a fake tan
(Oh, my life)
Satan is Helen Keller to people
Until we all agree he a liar, we ain't equal
(It's in His hands so I don't stress, I pray and strategize)
Brought souls to Hov, now bring the souls to Jehovah
Raised in the cold, thank God I'm bipolar
I wouldn't do a Doc on Mike, I'm not Oprah
Drenched in the blood, I'm not what 'cha call sober
I followed in the word and did what the Lord told us
Now I've got the culture back on my shoulders

[Chorus: KayCyy]
Keep my spirit alive
Keep my spirit alive, alive
More than enough
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
The spirit won't die, die
Oh, my live (Yeah)
It's in His hands so I don't stress, I pray and strategize
Lyrics from TikTok snippet

[Pre-Chorus: PinkPantheress & WILLOW]
No, oh
I don't know what to do
I wish that I'd never met you, no oh

[Chorus: PinkPantheress, WILLOW]
So please tell me where you are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Now my life's a downward spiral, got my broken heart recycled
Please tell me where you are, are, are, are, are
I've lost sight of what to do, don't spend one day in my shoes

[Hook]
Don't claim alive that you ain’t leaving yourself
Nigga stop on them lines you must be kiddin' yourself
Don't claim alive that you ain’t leaving yourself
For them lies you be telling you must be killing yourself
I ain't surprised you still be kiddin' yourself
You be kiddin' yourself
You be kiddin' yourself
I ain't surprised that you be kiddin' yourself
You be kiddin' yourself
More than anyone else

[Verse]
I work for mine and there ain’t anyone asking
Top of the game I’ma head of my class
If I take you with me you ain't get enough path
Sometimes I spend it cuz I get it right back
Ride for my gang and that’s a well known fact
Pound in a day that's how we smoke so fast
Roll up a paper now the dope don't last
Don't say a thing now we just puff puff pass

[Hook]
Don’t claim alive that you ain't leaving yourself
Nigga stop on them lines you must be kiddin' yourself
Don't claim alive that you ain't leaving yourself
For them lies you be telling you must be killing yourself
I ain't surprised you still be kiddin' yourself
You be kiddin' yourself
You be kiddin' yourself
I ain't surprised that you be kiddin' yourself
You be kiddin' yourself
More than anyone else

Don't claim alive that you ain't leaving yourself
Nigga stop on them lines you must be kiddin' yourself
Don't claim alive that you ain't leaving yourself
For them lies you be telling you must be killing yourself
I ain't surprised you still be kiddin' yourself
You be kiddin' yourself
You be kiddin' yourself
I ain't surprised that you be kiddin' yourself
You be kiddin' yourself

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Bitches come a dime a dozen; I fuck 'em, sisters, cousins
It's a revolvin' door: pussy goin', pussy comin'
And when they go to you, it's coming back to me with money
I tell her, "Put them shoes on and keep my paper runnin'"
I put my mack down, just like a G supposed to
And if she don't come home with it, then she sleepin' over
I got ‘em creepin' over; we doin' dinner soda
I like the Ameries—you can have them Omarosas
Them niggas down below us—baby, we up and over
I'm tryna get inside that thing that’s in between your shoulders
I'm talkin' large totals, I'm talkin' large motives
I'm talkin' burnin' rubber—that melted Pirelli odor
I'm hoppin' out a Lotus—you lookin' at my bitch?
You wanna holler? You can holler—take her on a trip
But when the deed done, you gotta send her back
Don't be surprised if she ask where the cash at

[Hook: Lil Wayne sample/Lil Wayne]
Where the— where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?”
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?” (Yeah, ha)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne & DJ tags]
I got a bitch in the back (Back), got a ho in the front (Front)
Got purp' in the Dutch (Yeah), got purp' in the cup
I tell her, "Get your money, ho, or just stop breathin'
' Cause if it ain't about that dough, it ain't about me, neither" (Gangsta—)
See, a gangsta like myself? I get that paper and pussy
Then I went and make that pussy bring that paper straight to me , bitch!
You lookin' at a real pimp—ask my old hoes (Yeah)
And they'll tell you, no remote, I control hoes
I'm a whole load—give you that game, mama
If he ain't payin', then he shouldn't be playin’—I’m sayin'
Broke niggas only make jokes, nigga (Ha)
I make more then I can fit in this quote, nigga —
Unquote—come sun-soak with me, bitch
Fly you down here and put you on some South Beach shit (Yeah)
And if you smile at my bitch, I make her smile back (Back)

Where the— Where the cash at (Uh-huh), where the cash at (Geah)
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?” (Check, yo, look)

[Verse 3: Remy Ma]
See, that other chick asked that—she said, "Where the cash at?" Rem’ said, "Where the paper, plastic, product, and where the stash at?
Where the keys to the whip and the crib, and where’s the address of—
That bitch that be hidin' shit in her ass-crack?"
Niggas I'm fuckin' call me “baby,” like I'm related to Weezy
Some of 'em call me “R-uh”; none of them call me easy
Found out I'm fuckin' her man—now this bird is callin' me, screamin'
Chicken, wait—bitches I be fryin', they just call me greasy
See, I know he got a main, but I'm cool being the other one
'Cause he can't get tight when he hear I piped another one
I don’t fall in love with them—cum and then I'm done with them
Most they get from me is wet pussy and some bubblegum, but—
This one dude had me laughin' (Haha)
If it's just one thing I can't stand, it's a baggy Magnum
Would've thought somebody threw me a camera the way I caught a flashback
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?”

[Hook: Lil Wayne sample]
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?”
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Where the— Where the cash at, where the cash at
Don't be surprised if she ask, “Where the cash at?”

(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
(DJ Meech, lil' bitch)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Them niggas get on y'all ass, y'all play with me like I ain't worse
Tryna gossip up the blogs like y'all ain't said my name first
He a junkie, he ain't shot his gun yet, he blame Percs
Shot a video and had a shootout in the same shirt
What you know about popping out and trying to hit they face first?
They like Smurk, "Your ass be tripping, better put your case first"
Choking who? I heard them rumors, niggas better play slow
I don't want no niggas who you catch, I want the one I paid for
We on his ass, he in the A, you see how long they stay for
Ain't no hotel room, we pop outside the Hyatt with dracos
Hellcats, they get off any scene, the police chase those
Trolling ass, we shot your homie, we ain't know he can take those
If I say your name, don't post it, opps be on all kind of shit
Ain't got time to watch your page to see if niggas died or shit
I know bitches set you up, literally, niggas dying to hit
In this industry, ain't what it seem, this shit be counterfeit
Ain't no lacking, she say I'm a nigga from the trenches with a accent
Why you asking me who shot your homie, why you asking?
You got my number, you post shit on the 'Gram, you moving backwards
You lucky I don't be doing shit for the 'Gram, you niggas cowards

[Chorus: Lil Durk & Gucci Mane]
Better not believe no rumors, rest in peace to Koopa
I jumped on the school bus and I had brung a Ruger
Always drank an 8th of Act', I never drunk a cooler
They get your location, they might pop outside in Ubers
When his goofy ass jumped in the streets? His ass a hooper
I know this shit don't matter, I took a shower with a cougar
Bring him out retirement, he gon' kill you for that mula
Catch him in the morning, wake him up, that boy a rooster (Go)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
He took it to trial, I tried to tell him it was stupid (I knew it)
They gave him so much time, his knees got weak and he was woozy (Damn)
Watch the shit you say, the feds be listening to the music (Woah)
And they gon' take your lyrics and build a case and try to use it
D.A. dropped my murder, didn't have evidence to prove it (Nah)
I think my house is haunted, yeah, by who? The ghost of Pookie (Woah)
He ain't killed nobody but keep rapping about the shootings (Pussy)
Still ain't got revenge yet but keep making up excuses (Wow)
Cuz done drank so much lean that his gut got big as Gucci's (Lean)
Told him quit while he ahead and don't go out like Whitney Houston (Huh?)
He got caught without it, now they robbing him for his rubies (Woah)
He wouldn't give it up so he got buried in his Cuban (It's Gucci)

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Better not believe no rumors, rest in peace to Koopa
I jumped on the school bus, and I had brung a Ruger
Always drank an 8th of Act', I never drunk a cooler
They get your location, they might pop outside in Ubers
When his goofy ass jumped in the streets? His ass a hooper
I know this shit don't matter, I took a shower with a cougar
Bring him out retirement, he gon' kill you for that mula
Catch him in the morning, wake him up, that boy a rooster
And by the way, I might have mentioned err, that err, Leona just err, came from The Main Point and Gordon Lightfoot will be there next week, and err, Joni Mitchell, err, will continue at The 2nd Fret for another week and erm, you'll be able to see her every night next week but Tuesday, that's the off night. Okay, erm, shall we err, go back to our requests list here? Do you wanna?
Certainly
You've got a lot of tracks there
Yeah
If I sing this song, doеs everyone want to sing along with mе? Vincent?
Yeah, why don't you move in a little
Donda, do you know the chorus at all?
I don't really know it
Do you want to take a chance on it? Pick up lines when you get it?
Because I sing so clearly
Sure, togetherness
Come on Steve, we'll all get in on this
Anybody on there have a good voice?
If somehow the song doesn't sound right, it doesn't matter
Wait, where am I? I'm in a funny tuning and I don't know where I am...
Oh, I know where I am
Here we go

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Rows and floes of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

[Verse 2]
But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

[Chorus]
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

[Verse 3]
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way that you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

[Verse 4]
But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

[Chorus]
I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

[Verse 5]
Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say "I love you" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

[Verse 6]
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

[Chorus]
I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life
At all

[Chorus]
I've looked at life from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life
At all

[Verse 1]
Yesterday a child came out to wonder
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
And tearful at the falling of a star

[Chorus]
And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go 'round and 'round and 'round
In the circle game

[Verse 2]
Then the child moved ten times 'round the seasons
Skated ovеr ten clear frozen strеams
Words like "when you're older" must appease him
And promises of someday make his dreams

[Chorus]
And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go 'round and 'round and 'round
In the circle game

[Verse 3]
Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town
And they tell him, "Take your time, it won't be long now
'Til you drag your feet to slow the circles down"

[Chorus]
And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go 'round and 'round and 'round
In the circle game

[Verse 4]
So, the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty
Before the last revolving year is through

[Chorus]
And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go 'round and 'round and 'round
In the circle game
And go 'round and 'round and 'round
In the circle game

[Intro]
We're very proud to present at this time, and a very happy welcome back to one of our favourite people, one of our favourite performers, one of the country's very talented young songwriters. Let's have a warm welcome now, for Joni Mitchell

[Verse 1]
When morning comes to Morgantown
The merchants roll their awnings down
The milk trucks make their morning rounds
In morning Morgantown

[Verse 2]
We'll rise up early with the sun
To ride the bus whilе everyone is yawning
And thе day is young
In morning Morgantown

[Chorus]
Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams, a dollar down
Morning any town you name
Morning's just the same

[Verse 3]
We'll find a table in the shade
And sip our tea and lemonade
And watch the morning on parade
In morning Morgantown

[Verse 4]
Ladies in their rainbow fashions
Colored stop and go lights flashing
We'll wink as total strangers pass
In morning Morgantown

[Chorus]
Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams, a dollar down
Morning, any town you name
Morning's just the same

[Verse 5]
I'd like to buy you everything
A wooden bird with painted wings
A window full of colored rings
In morning Morgantown

[Verse 6]
But the only thing I have to give
To make you smile, to win you with
Are all the mornings still to live
In morning Morgantown

[Chorus]
Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams, a dollar down
Morning, any town you name
Morning's just the same

[Outro]
Aren't you glad you came?
Morning Morgantown

[Intro]
This is a travel song. It's the only travel song I've written, and, erm, it's what you might call a very idealistic kind of travel song, and err, the reason for that is that I wrote it before I ever travelled any place. It has a very idealistic kind of sing-along chorus that I would like to invite you to sing with, erm, if you would like? And it goes like this:

[Verse 1]
See the stretching sun at dawning
Wipe the stardust from his eyes
Feel the morning breezes yawning
Telling me it's time to rise
Telling me it's time to rise

[Chorus]
I was born to take the highway
I was born to chase a dream
Any road at all is my way
Any place is where I've been
Anything is what I've seen

[Break]
Now the last part of that was the chorus, and the part that I would like you to remember if you don't know the chorus at all, which you probably don't, is a line that goes like this:
"Anything is what I've seen"
And the cue word that you should look for comes just before that is "been", and that's Canadian for 'been' in case you were wondering

[Verse 2]
Gambler's gold is meant for squandering
Miser's silver is to hoard
My gold 'cross the sky goes wandering
My silver is a drinking gourd
My silver is the drinking gourd

[Chorus]
I was born to take the highway
I was born to chase a dream
Any road at all is my way
Any place is where I've been
Anything is what I've seen

[Verse 3]
I've skipped on concrete, danced on cobbles
Stepped on pavement in the heat
I've seen where children crouched at marbles
Made chalk circles in the street
Found a penny at my feet

[Chorus]
I was born to take the highway
I was born to chase a dream
Any road at all is my way
Any place is where I've been
Anything is what I've seen

[Break]
Got one more chance

[Verse 4]
Now, I know a road that winds forever
Through the land the rainbows run
You cross the bridge from now 'til never
Take the first turn past the sun
Take the first turn beyond the sun

[Chorus]
I was born to take the highway
I was born to chase a dream
Any road at all is my way
Any place is where I've been
Anything is what I've seen

[Outro]
Oh oh, I lost my pic
You see it fell right down there
There are probably about fourteen pics down there, I lose them every night
No luck?
It's just right down there
Oh well, I won't use it, I'll finger-pic it
If you've every lived in the small town, or in a small country, sort of rural area, where you had the freedom to walk out into the fields or into the forests or into a slew, or whatever you like to walk into, erm, and then you were suddenly transplanted into, into a big city, and expect to be a city person, you're bound to be full of contradictions and confections and things, because the city does funny things to you, and yet you still remember all of the wonderful things and the freedom of the country

So, you get people saying things like "I'm gonna be a hermit", and "I'm gonna go off and I'm gonna live in the woods and I'm gonna catch rabbits and cook them and stew them up, and I'm just gonna be completely independent", and err, that's really hard after you've lived in the city for a while, no matter where you've lived before, because you get used to city-fied things like escalators and cafeterias and err, supermarkets, things like that, and the local discotheque where everybody hangs out, right

You would miss the local gang if you tried to be a hermit

So people say all sorts of romantic things, and they try to identify with birds and they say "Wow, I wish I could have that kind of freedom."

But it isn't really very realistic

That's what this song is about

I, I think I'll be alright on this one, thanks, thanks Derek

[Verse 1]
Fly silly seabird, no dreams can possess you
No voices can blame you for sun on your wings
My gentle relations have names they must call me
For loving the freedom of all flying things

[Chorus]
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach, out of cry

[Verse 2]
I came to the city and lived like old Crusoe
On an island of noise in a cobblestone sea
And the beaches were concrete and the stars paid a light bill
And the blossoms hung false on their store window trees

[Chorus]
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach, out of cry

[Verse 3]
Out of thе city and down to the seaside
To sun on my shouldеrs and wind in my hair
But sandcastles crumble and hunger is human
And humans are hungry for worlds they can't share

[Chorus]
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach, out of cry

[Verse 4]
I call to a seagull who dives to the waters
And catches his silver-fine dinner alone
Crying where are the footprints that danced on these beaches
And the hands that cast wishes that sunk like a stone

[Chorus]
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach, out of cry

[Intro]
This is a love song that actually was intender for a man to sing to a woman, I wrote it that way, and err. Then I decided that I liked to sing it anyway. It goes like this:

[Verse 1]
Winter Lady, where you going
With your hair all soft and loose like snowing?
Winter girl, December child
Don't run away

[Verse 2]
Winter Lady, walking sadly
Does your lover treat you badly
Do you dream or wish on stars
To hear him say

[Chorus]
"Oh, Winter Lady I won’t hurt you
I won't cheat you, I won't desert you
Winter Lady you need loving
I need loving too
I need loving you"

[Verse 3]
Staring out your winter window
At a silver sky you know you’ve been to
In a kiss, upon a day
Before a spring

[Verse 4]
Winter Lady, cry those crystal tears
He won't know what he's missed
'Til lovе's too late, you've changed your mind
And it's my turn to sing

[Chorus]
Oh, Wintеr Lady I won't hurt you
I won’t cheat you, I won’t desert you
Winter Lady you need loving
I need loving too
I need loving you
How many people were here for the first show, anybody?
You were here for the first show
Well, due to the difficulty of taping and all these things, I'm going to repeat myself, two songs worth, but they're my favourite two songs to sing, and, err, so I that, that they'll be your favourite two songs to listen to
One of them comes from a book called "Henderson The Rain King". And I'm right in the middle of the book, and I left Henderson en route to Africa, saying "In an age when man can look down and see clouds, and look up and see clouds, he shouldn't really be afraid or amazed by anything", and I liked the idea of that, so I developed it into a song called... Tune your guitar...
This is a song called "From Both Sides Now"

[Verse 1]
Rows and floes of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

[Verse 2]
But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

[Chorus]
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

[Verse 3]
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

[Verse 4]
But now it's just another show
You leave them laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

[Chorus]
I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

[Verse 5]
Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say "I love you" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

[Verse 6]
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

[Chorus]
I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all

[Chorus]
I've looked at life from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all

[Verse 1]
Close your eyes and clone yourself
Build your heart an army
To defend your innocence
While you do everything wrong
Don't be scared to walk alone
Don't be scared to like it
There's no time that you must be home
So sleep where darkness falls

[Chorus]
Alive in the age of worry
Smile in the age of worry
Go out in the age of worry
And say, "Worry, why should I care?"
Ooh!

[Verse 2]
No, your fight is not with them
Yours is with your time here
So dream your dreams, but don't prеtend
Make friends with what you arе
Give your heart and change your mind
You're allowed to do it
'Cause God knows it's been done to you and
Somehow you got through it

[Chorus]
Alive in the age of worry
Smile in the age of worry
Go out in the age of worry
And say, "Worry, why should I care?"

[Outro]
Ooh!
Rage in the age of worry
Act your age in the age of worry
And say, "Worry, get out of here"
Gotta get out, get out of here
Gotta get out
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh!
Joan, could you sing err, "Blue On Blue", I've never heard "Blue On Blue" when I've been with you
Haven't you?
Oh, maybe I did, maybe I did. I don't think you sang it last week, but you, err
What else is on that list?
On that list? Now let's see. Erm
There must be something that I haven't done on the show
Err
I could do my new song that isn't finished yet, "Eastern Rain" I could do?
Okay, whatever you wanna do
Let me do that one, that one wasn't even requested but
What's that
"Eastern Rain"
Alright
Are you ever in a stray tune? How often are you? Usually everything has
Only one song, "Urge For Going" so, err
Sorry, haha
This is my one eastern influenced song

[Verse 1]
Rain comes from the east one night, we watch it come
To hang like beaded curtains, 'til the morning sun
Water dripping from our clothes
You with raindrops on your nose
Ask me sadly "Please don't go away now
'Til the rain is done", I say "I'll stay now"

[Verse 2]
Rain outside but inside we don't mind at all
Shadows by the fire slowly climb and fall
Kisses fade and leave no trace
Whispers vanish into space
The dawn will send me on a chase to nowhere
Why cry as if I were the first to go there

[Chorus]
And I know I shouldn't be here
Yes, I know I should go home
But that eastern rain drones in my brain
And I'm so all alone, so all alone

[Verse 3]
Morning comes up from the east, we watch it come
And far away now rolls the ancient rain God's drum
You with daybreak in your eyes
Afraid to speak for telling lies
I watch you search for some reply to lend me
But when the rain is done there's no pretending

[Chorus]
And I know I shouldn't be here
Yes, I know I should go home
But that eastern rain drones in my brain
And I'm so all alone, so all alone
What you gonna do?
Well, we got a new request for "Blue On Blue", so I guess that has most ticks, does it?
I think so, yeah
I think so
Have you heard "Blue On Blue"?
No. Maybe I did
I think you heard this one
I probably did
Yeah, I think so
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
Woke up pulling dracos out
Which one of y'all off in a takeout?
Pictures of your safehouse
No, swear to God i never been a hoe
Raised on a tended shows
Where the buildings look identical
In the sheets, smelling chemicals
Momma know my nose clean
In a morse, calling dope fiends
Had to put 'em in a trove scene
Heard he was rigged, see him fallin'
Stick your waist out
Media frenzy, it's a chaseout
When i'm under pressure, put a skates out

Swingin' in the backyard, pull up in your fast car
Whistlin' my name
Open up a beer and you say, "Get over here"
And play a video game
I'm in his favorite sundress, watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown
I say, "You da bestest," lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on
"Go play your video game"

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time

Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey
Is that true?
It's better than I evеr even knew
Thеy say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And baby, now, you do
Hmmm
Singin' in the old bars, swinging with the old stars
Livin' for the fame
Kissin' in the blue dark, playing pool and wild darts
Video games
He holds me in his big arms, drunk, and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watchin' all our friends fall in and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time

Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey
Is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And baby, now, you do

(N-now, you do, now, you do, now, you do)
(N-now, you do, now, you do, now, you do)
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time

Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey
Is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And baby, now, you do

[Verse 1]
I come from a small town, how 'bout you?
I only mention it 'cause I'm ready to leave LA
And I want you to come
Eighty miles north or south will do
I don't care where as long as you're with me
And I'm with you and you let me

[Chorus]
Let me love you like a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be who I'm meant to be
Talk to me in poems and songs
Don't make me be bittersweet
Let me love you like a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me hold you like a baby

[Verse 2]
I come from a small town far away
I only mention it 'cause I'm ready to leave LA
And I want you to come (And I need you to come)
I guess I could manage if you stay
It's just if you do, I can't see myself having any fun, so

[Chorus]
Let me love you like a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be who I'm meant to be
Talk to me in songs and poems
Don't make me be bittersweet
Let me love you like a woman

[Post-Chorus]
Take you to infinity
Let me love you like a woman (Let me hold you like a baby)
Take you to infinity
Let me love you like a woman (Let me hold you like a baby)
Take you to infinity

[Bridge]
We could get lost in the purple rain
Talk about the good ol' days
We could get high on some pink champagne
Baby, let me count the ways

[Chorus]
Let me love you like a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be who I'm meant to be
Talk to me in songs and poems
Don't make me be bittersweet
Let me love you like a woman

She forgot to put it in the mailbox
What the fox?

[Chorus]
Whoo, Mr. Postman
Yeah
Wow
Yeah
Work you over for fifty cents, Charlie
You're just lucky I don't have any hardware with me
Darn lucky, I tell ya

[Radio Announcer]
It was gambling that brought the rising star of mobster Big Boy Caprice to zenith and brought crime buster Dick Tracy onto his scent
Caprice made his bones in the small-time extortion and protection rackets on the South Side
And his prosecuted vendettas with the ruthless tenacity that earned him a reputation for cunning, murderous unpredictability, and an unwillingness to forgive, which is remarkable evеn on that seamy side of town

Business ownеrs who failed to cough up Big Boy's exorbitant demands for tribute were hastily extinguished
And many a small-time operator learned the hard way with the Mob not rough stuff meant by territory, a school lesson that ended with a student grasped in a pair of cement overshoes

[Ice-T]
Dick Tracy, look out crooks you better break out
'Cause Tracy's chillin' on a stake out
He's in town and he's huntin' Big Boy Caprice
Tracy's on the C-A-S-E
It's no win if you think about doin' crime
Tracy have you doin' time (Word)
When you dealin' with hoods like Flattop
He roam solo, he doesn't need a backup cop
He just talks in the radio that's on his wrist
Pat Patton’ll hook 'em up quick
He makes his move but suckas is in his way for pay
Dick Tracy don't play

[Radio Announcer]
Caprice would scratch, claw, double-cross and slaughter his way to the top of an ugly heap
And by the time he was there, his greedy eye would wander to the spoils of national control of the rackets
He was surrounded by around-the-clock assortment of goons, pimps, shills, confidants, tricksters, flim-flam men, and lead-jawed gunmen who responded to his every urge

[Ice-T]
Dick Tracy, a real man no phony
He better watch out for Breathless Mahoney
'Cause this girl's sexy and I'm talkin' 'bout super hot
And she workin' on Tracy's soft spot
Tess Trueheart is the one he's in love with
Gotta keep a cool head so he don't flip
But Tracy's too tough for that
He gotta get Pruneface, Numbers and the Rodent pack
Influence and the thugs at the Ritz understand
This Tracy don't quit 'til he gets his man
And I'm talkin' 'bout them
Dick Tracy's in the back again

[Radio Announcer]
By degrees, his empire grew
An empire that fashioned itself into an unseemly
Replica of a king's court, where a jester could be put to death
With the sole wink of a Neapolitan eyelid
And aware he could bring a whole neighborhood to its knees
With a particularly unpleasant visit from one of the squads of amici di amici, of friends of friends
The territory came into control of an iron hand who was not called the ‘Carnival of Death’ for nothing
And Big Boy Caprice had given this sobriquet a vicious ring many times over
It seemed that nothing would stop him

[Ice-T]
Dick Tracy not the one you want to cross, boss
Step to him and you'll be needing smelling salts
'Cause he's the C-O-P on the J-O-B
So don't M-E-S-S with T-R-A-C-why?
'Cause Tracy's gonna rock the place
Put away Shoulders, The Plank, Little Face
And any other crook that wanna break ill
You gotta problem, Dick Tracy's the bill
He found a kid that they call Shakesy J.R
A good kid, the boy's gonna go far
Sam Catchem is another on the right side
But if you're not, then fool, you better run and hide from Dick Tracy

[Radio Announcer]
Not politicians, not union bosses, not racketeers, not the treachery of its fellow serpents
Not the heady aroma of power-lust would be enough to undo this model of pure evil
Nothing but Dick Tracy, whose name had come up in regard to the office of Police Chief on the South Side
Tracy had handled the likes of Caprice before and seen the hideous 

[?] of other hoodlums end up behind bars
But here was a king whose calling card was widowhood and a proven river of scarlet that drained itself in the city sewers

[Ice-T]
Dick Tracy is comin' to your town soon
Wipin' out all the mugs and the goons
So if you're wrong you better move to some other place
Or stay the hell out his face
'Cause he don't joke
When it comes to crime, he go for broke
Even if the pistol smoke
He gets the job done, the man don't run
Talk about bad, Dick Tracy's the one
Untouchable, the unstoppable
(Tracy's on the take)
Tha's impossible
Supercop is no crook's friend
Dick Tracy's in the streets again

[Radio Announcer]
He would create a reign of terror and a flow of blood that would not be stopped by anything but Dick Tracy and the nation's boldest crime busters
‘Ha, ha, ha,’ the gangsters laughed at headlines that promised a head-on war from the Attorney General's office
Cackles were heard again in mafia back parlors at the mention of Attorney General's Fletcher's campaign for the mayoral office
A campaign that Caprice and his underbosses, Flattop, Pruneface, Influence and Mumbles, would conspire to bring to an abrupt halt and give the would-be officeholder an involuntary dirt nap
Focus of the tentacles of Caprice and his hideous family was gambling

The glamour of 

[?] that kept the masses hostage to a dream and eternal slavery to the hope that this week, this month their lucky number would come up, a hope that somehow never materialized
Roulette, Craps, Black Jack, Keno, the ponies and the puppies were all wrenched and pulled like the strings of a marionette with a shiny visage by Caprice and his allies
The city, with its hopeless masses, hooked like dope fiends on the game of the moment waltzed to the gangsters’ tune and kept the parade of corrupt officials on the payroll to ensure that the waltz played on

One who dared contradict them was club owner Lips Manlis, proprietor of the Club Ritz
Big Boy Caprice wanted in; Manlis wouldn't yield
Lips was soon separated from the living in a lavish funeral and Caprice took over the Club Ritz
And with it came Manlis' former moll, the songbird that would become 

[?] Breathless Mahoney
Breathless would not be allowed to mourn long, for the party would go on every night as it always did
Would Tracy drop by to bring it to a halt?
When would gunfire rival the popping of champagne corks?
For wherever Caprice roamed blood would find him sooner or later (Sooner or later, sooner or later, sooner or later…)

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yes
Pineapple Sunkiss, baby
Laced up
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, all these hoes ain't nothin' but hoes
I got a few college bitches and a couple of pros
I cut 'em like cards, I just shuffle and fold
Got so many on my bag that my duffle is swole, woah
I like them sweet southern country hoes
I don't care about them east coast grumpy hoes
And my west coast girl got her own condo
Got me 'bout to buy a crib by the Hollywood O, oh
It's -
That nigga they be checkin' for
I'm prolly gettin' head, from a bitch I never met before
Perfеctly protected though, Magnum's my weapon, hoе
Bah, Bah, Bah, Bah, Bah, Bah, Bah, Bah, Bah, die slow

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Now shake, bounce, toss that ass like rover
Rock the boat, don't tip the boat over
All these house tryna play that roll
But I wrote the script baby, let's start the show
I said shake, bounce, toss that ass like rover
Rock the boat don't tip the boat over
All these house tryna play that roll
But I wrote the script baby let's start the show

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Miss -
Fat pussy, how you doing? Where you going?
Where you from? Can I come?
Can a nigga get a turn? Then -
Like Usher let it burn, like a perm
Say she got some good brain
I say well shit I need to learn
See I straight hit the block like Big Worm
Jiffy peanut butter seats, softer than Lubriderm, hoe, haha
See that's how the shit go
Damn it feel good to tell a bitch no
Me, I let a bitch know, straight from the door
No dope just dick bitch, kick snow
Then what happens after all was said
I was getting some head
Get-Getting some head

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Now shake, bounce, toss that ass like rover
Rock the boat, don't tip the boat over
All these house tryna play that roll
But I wrote the script baby, let's start the show
I said shake, bounce, toss that ass like rover
Rock the boat don't tip the boat over
All these house tryna play that roll
But I wrote the script baby let's start the show

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
It's like everywhere I'm is-a and everywhere I go
Curren$y is known for running through these pretty hoes
And it's easy to do, because nigga been told
Put me up on the game when I step through the doors
Ohh I, dammit, I'm so quick
Slow flow, but the game will run a circle 'round a bitch
Shawty got a 9-5, I bet you I could make her quit
Now her man mad at her cause he found out that she strip, ha
This one chick that I had from the 7th Ward
Red bone with two gold teeth, from out the St. Bernard Projects
I slept, 'cause shawty used to break it off
She had two sons, I used to buy them lil' racing cars
But I'm a dog, so you know it didn't last
Gotta keep 100 bitches in and out they back to back
'Cause pimpin' ain't easy but it gotta be done
By Curren$y, the Hot Spitta and the Birdman's son

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Now shake, bounce, toss that ass like rover
Rock the boat, don't tip the boat over
All these house tryna play that roll
But I wrote the script baby, let's start the show
I said shake, bounce, toss that ass like rover
Rock the boat don't tip the boat over
All these house tryna play that roll
But I wrote the script baby let's start the show

[Verse 1]
Lord, have mercy, child
What do you want?
What do you need right now?
I think I'm free, but I'm tied down
Maybe it's greed to take what's found
A Wounded Knee that came unwound
Anesthesia, please knock me out

[Chorus]
Déjà vu in a town like this
Only simply makes me miss
Everything all about you
Everything that we would do

[Verse 2]
Do dirty dancing in a tiny town
Red, white and blue
Black and brown
No romancing, don't you mess around
A sweet taboo and you made a vow (Mmm, yes, sir)

[Chorus]
Déjà vu in a town like this
Only simply makes me miss
Everything all about you
Everything that we would do

[Verse 1: Toro y Moi]
Nothing here to see, factories overseas
Cut down all these trees, we buildin' Model T's
No more drama please, no more dramamine
I'ma throw it up all over all the seats

[Refrain: Toro y Moi]
This man in the magazine
It's just us we wanna see
This man in the magazine
It's just us we wanna see

[Chorus: Salami Rose Joe Louis]
I don't know how to get up out of bed
The thoughts of what you said are in my head
I wanna be away from everyone
I shattered all the daylight in the sun

[Verse 2: Toro y Moi]
Rosemary bushes still grow everywhere
Cut and burn it all so wе can say a prayer
How did I get so wrapped in currеnt affairs?
Inescapable extinction tries to scare

[Chorus: Salami Rose Joe Louis]
I don't know how to get up out of bed
The thoughts of what you said are in my head
I wanna be away from everyone
I shattered all the daylight in the sun

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Oh my, where did the weekend go?
Oh man, Monday snuck up so fast
No one keeps me in the loop when I kick back
Guess it's up to me to stay in the loop

[Chorus]
Oh, stayin' in the loop
Stayin' in the loop, stayin' in the loop, yeah
Stayin' in the loop, stayin' in the loop
Stayin' in the loop, yeah, uh
Gotta stay up in the loop, stayin' in the loop
Stayin' in the loop, stayin' in the loop, yeah
Stayin' in the loop, stayin' in the loop
Stayin' in the loop, yeah

[Verse 2]
East coast friends, fill me in
I know you get the early scoop
Online trends that border cringe
Start to feel overused
I saw this band I think you dig
But the record got bad reviews
But then the singer looked into my eyes all across the room
And he said, "Damn"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
St. Louis to New Orleans
Someone take me off my feet
Rode horseback down the Mississippi
Someone gotta keep me in the loop, please
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da, da
Ooh, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da

[Instrumental Break]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Bad girl if you wanted)

[Verse 1]
I'm focused on you, you're all on me too
I'm cute and I'm rude, and you like what I do
You said I run through your mind, so I put love on the line
I scared you away, you missed the chance of a lifetime

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're lonely
Are you ever thinking 'bout the magic in me?
Do you wish I was yours?
When you're lonely (When you're lonely)
Am I ever on your mind on constant repeat?
Is it me that you want?

[Chorus]
Do you realize I could've been the one to change your life?
You could've had a bad girl by your side
You could've had a bad girl
Could've had a bad girl if you wanted (Bad girl)
Do you even know the reasons why you had to let me go?
(Do you know?)
You could've had a bad girl by your side
You could've had a bad girl
Could've had a bad girl if you wanted (Bad girl)

[Verse 2]
I'm focused on you, you're all on me too
Told you I'm cute and I'm rude with kinda rare attitude
You said I'm still on your mind, but now I don't have the time
You should've been brave, you missed the chance of a lifetime

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're lonely
Are you ever thinking 'bout the magic in me?
Do you wish I was yours?
When you're lonely (When you're lonely)
Am I ever on your mind on constant repeat?
Is it me that you want?

[Chorus]
Do you realize I could've been the one to change your life?
You could've had a bad girl by your side
You could've had a bad girl
Could've had a bad girl if you wanted (Bad girl)
Do you even know the reasons why you had to let me go?
(Do you know?)
You could've had a bad girl by your side
You could've had a bad girl
Could've had a bad girl if you wanted (Bad girl)

[Outro]
Got me on repeat, got me on repeat
Got me on repeat, got me on repeat-peat
Got me on repeat, got me on repeat
Got me on repeat, got me on repeat-peat
Got me on repeat, got me on repeat
Got me on repeat, got me on repeat-peat
Got me on repeat, got me on repeat
Got me on repeat, got me on repeat-peat

[Verse 1]
When I met you it was tragic
Chemistry something like magic
You were with somebody else long term
And I was with somebody else as well
Met up late night by the Bowery
And in the morning we got coffee
Acting like strangers, and told no friends
It wasn't easy to pretend

[Pre-Chorus]
And we know that it's wrong, but it feels real fun
Sneakin' around, fallin' deep in love
But sometimes I get scared
'Cause I know it's unfair
I'm hurting someone else instead

[Chorus]
I'm breakin' every rule for you
You're breakin' every rule for me
I'm breakin' every rule for you
But I've gotta say
I want it this way
These moments really set me free

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah, ah (Ah-ah)
Ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah, ah (Ah-ah)

[Verse 2]
Straight away we started fallin'
Conversation never borin'
When your lips brushed up against my skin
All I wanted was to let you in
I wonder if people will notice
Said you find it so hard to focus
Cigarettes up on the balcony
Wrapped up in nothing but sheets

[Pre-Chorus]
And we know that it's wrong
But it feels real fun
Sneakin' around, fallin' deep in love
But sometimes I get scared
'Cause I know it's unfair
I'm hurtin' someone else instead

[Chorus]
I'm breakin' every rule for you
You're breakin' every rule for me
I'm breakin' every rule for you
But I've gotta say
I want it this way
These moments really set me free

[Outro]
Ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah, ah (Ah-ah)
Ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah, ah (Ah-ah)

[Intro]
Shit, yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
My dome golden
My heart bleed Madison and Homan
Yeah, back to Madison and Kedzie
Madison and Albany, we right back into home again
Where them dwellings wasn't buildings
Intelligent ain't skilled until the fellas got the felons in they feelings
Yelling to the ceiling
Scale again, the pelicans is skeletons and villains
Oh no, no, I'm just rolling, I can't even flee
When I see old money, old money
Veterans and millions, elegant and brilliant
Ain't no food and liquor three, we on that medicine and killing
Off top, free Chill, yeah, uh
Generating Zen with some nice sword practice
Rest In Peace Virg', LV, it's Vice Lord backwards
A simple flip of the monogram
That ain't shit, I had similes on my sonogram, my momma's man
Before I was born, I was doing reconnaissance
My barber taught me how to chop a nigga with my chopper hand
Not at all prophetic
Just chauffeurs in Allah's Lexus
The realest nigga alive, no prosthetics or cosmetics
Might catch the Holy Ghost and start speaking in Nas records
Hah, hah, hah, said he came through the town
Had the flames on his crown, the youth was all excited
And Memphis drooped his whole fuckin' name into the ground like

[Interlude]
Gangsta Boo, what up?
Yeah, hah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
That's this, what if rap had a blacksmith?
The day you catch me lack
Is the day Farrakhan eats catfish as a Catholic
Reporting live from the blacklist
Accustomed to being this bad cause he packed it
But if they ask, that ain't my bag cause I traffic
See the lights from the O spark
Feeling like Austin meets Oak Park
A hundred Chicagos, they want no parts
He at the MCA yelling "Go, Art"
At the strip club with his eyes closed and throat parched
Westside with my whole heart, heart

[Outro]
Westside with my whole heart
Westside, ooh

[Intro: HoodyBaby]
(T-Take you a lil’ bit higher)

Snort a line off a hoe, that’s a body blow
Habit on the low
(T-Take you a lil’ bit higher)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh
I’m sellin’ cocaine by the elevator
Tell ‘em get on this cocaine, not the elevator
Always workin’, never broke, like the elevator
Hope your high come down slow, stop on every floor
I been sellin’ top shelf since a seventh grader
Make them Cookie Monsters pay for this vanilla wafеr
I say get on this cocaine and not this elеvator
‘Cause I can take you higher than your destination
(T-Take you a lil’ bit higher)
I ain’t got no freebies, I don’t do no favors
I don’t smoke no papers, I don’t smoke no vapor
Hear me coughin’, better not hear you coughin’ up no data
What happens at this elevator stays here like Las Vegas
Shout out my amigo, he owe me a hundred favors
So he’ll kill for me, save me the fuckin’ labor
I got Vanilla Ice, I got white chocolate, I got every flavor
Even Ray Rice couldn’t beat my price, at this elevator, no

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I’m sellin’ cocaine by the elevator
They rather get on this cocaine, not the elevator

Always workin’, never broke, like the elevator

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I been sellin’ Grade A since a seventh grader
Sold it to my teachers, got an A on every paper
Hope your high come down slow like a escalator
Take the stairway to heaven not the elevator

He’ll kill for me, I call him the undertaker
Not another seizure, no, I’m shakin’ off the haters
Tell ‘em I can take you higher, you can’t pay me later, no

Snort a line off a hoe, that’s a body blow
I take you a lil’ bit higher, ooh yeah

[Verse 3: HoodyBaby]
I’m the fat Busta Rhymes, I can flip modes
Word on the street that we hot but the jet cold
Up in this bitch gettin’ higher, let’s go
Out of town, out of state, out the country, I don’t know
Only thing I know, we ain’t  never out of money though
Only thing I love is a bitch nobody know
That’s nobody, so I love nobody hoe
Bitches on coke, lickin’ dope with a snotty nose
I’ma hit a line get to takin’ everybody hoe
Matter fact, I’ma just smoke, where the fuckin’ dro
Matter fact, let me smell the coke, let me smell the coke, you should smell the coke
Bring ya girl, put it down ya throat

Habit on the low, cocaine in the lobby hoe
Really got these women on fire

Even Ray Rice couldn’t beat my price, at this elevator, no

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]

Buy me an Italian talking parrot
Keep it for my friends
Buy me an Italian talking parrot
Keep it for my friends
Don’t talk to Italy
All around its bend

These are not your eggs, okay, look, look, look

[Verse 1]
I've been livin' out of this suitcase for way too long
Sellin' my coat and smokin' my last
Promise not to look into your past, no
Now I can say that I'm stronger
At least now I can admit that I was wrong
Won't hold it against myself
Won't hold it
Won't Hold it against myself
Hold it
Cause it's Heaven, Heaven, Heaven
Must be like this
Heaven, Heaven, Heaven

[Verse 2]
Oh, I used to put it in my Louis bag, let it overflow
Move it in, ship it out, tell me if they want some more (Woah, oh)
To stay a while, stay a while
'Cause I can't figure it out
I'll stay a while
Stand outside my door, just one more smile
Stay a while, stay a whilе
Same wind that blew the autumn lеaves across my floor
It shut the door stuck in left burning the sage
Rolling out to find you moved away
Stay a while, stay a while (Oh, oh, oh)
I used to put it in my Louis bag, let it overflow
Tell me if they really want some more
Friends are fallin' off, talkin' shit for no reason
'Cause it's robbin' season, season

[Verse 1]
Well, she slid down the hall in her socks and yelled, "Come outside"
No, no, no, nothing's wrong
I just happen to have a surprise
So we fell through the door like the autumn leaves
I wrestled my brother down to his knees
To watch as her rocket shot into the October sky

[Chorus]
There's a picture of us
In a layer of dust
On the mantle
Right by my cigarettes that I smoke since you left
'Cause you said you had to fly
In your October

[Verse 2]
Now I work in the city and I blend into the crowd
And the pеople grieve with mе since the towers came down
You could cut the pollution with a butter knife
You could wake up at two and then party all night
But I'm missin' my mama, so I stand on the street and get high

[Chorus]
There's a picture of us
Hidden in a layer of dust
On the mantle
Right by my cigarettes that I smoke since you left
'Cause you said you had to fly
In your October sky
La-la-la, la-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Bridge]
And as I go back home to Memphis
I remember days that I
I was outside shootin' rockets
Almost as high, high
Standing there in your October, October (Whoa)
October, October

[Outro]
Secret to tell is a change that i spare
To the ones that I love may life treat you well
'Cause I'm getting much older
In her October
And the same wind that blew those autumn leaves
Is the same wind that carries me
It covers me over
In her October (Whoa)

[Intro]
One, two
One, two, three
Yeah, ooh

[Verse 1]
It was a stormy winter
I watched the city burn
And ever since I can remember
That's just the way it hurts
And it goes on and on and on
Like I can never see the pinnacle of it all, it all

[Chorus]
Put it in my Louie Bag, don't let it overflow
If they want some more
Friends are fallin' off, talkin' shit for no reason
It's robbin' season, season

[Verse 2]
They cut my palms with paper
Made from her Autumn leaves
I'm bleedin' out disclaimers
Into my family tree
Fuck the interviews to enterprisе
I'd rather look into my mother's eyеs
And let it be

[Chorus]
So put it in my Louie Bag, don't let it overflow
Move it in and ship it out, tell me if they want some more
'Cause I got that fire, it's comin' for them now
Friends are fallin' off, talkin' shit for no reason
Checkin' all my locks 'cause it's robbin' season now
La, da-da, da-da, da
La-la, da-da, da-da, la, da, da-da, da-da

[Outro]
Remember us
Way before the time we fell
It was all in trust
Things we dreamed of
Even in our living hell given to us
It was all in trust, all in, all in, all, all, all, it's all in us
Remember us, 'member the day before we fell
It was all in trust, all in, all in, all in, all in, all in

[Intro]
La-la, da-da, da-da, Whoa

[Verse 1]
Tell me, will you leave me lonely?
On and on and on, I know you told me
The most important reason why
You'll color in as many lines as I need you
Tell me, when we have no money
And the sirens start their calling, you say
Slow down, slow down
Come on, slow down

[Chorus]
And this paranoia purple turns to green
And nothing is as simple as it seems
What's happening to me?

[Verse 2]
Say now, when my life is over
Will you find somebody good enough to hold ya?
Someone like my Abigail
To tell you all is good and well like me now
Say now, I feel my color show how
I think it's almost time for me to go now
Go now, go now

[Chorus]
And this paranoia purple turns to gray
And all that's good and well, it melts away
Until we meet again, again, again

[Outro]
How could I forget?
I still can't figure it out (Woah, oh)
I still can't figure it out
Five years, too many tears
Still can't figure you out
And I'll be right here
Oh, howling at the moon (Woah, oh)
Howling at the moon (Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Heaven, Heaven, Heaven
'Cause I'll be howling at the moon
And and still all I see it's you
Heaven, Heaven must be like this

[Verse 1]
I don't like cities, but I like New York
Other places make me feel like a dork
Los Angeles is for people who sleep
Paris and London, baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep, baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep, baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep, baby, you can keep
Baby, you can keep, baby, you can keep

[Chorus]
Other cities always make me mad
Other places always make me sad
No other city ever made me glad except New York
I love New York
I love New York
I love New York

[Verse 2]
If you don't like my attitude then you can F off
Just go to Texas, isn't that where they golf?
Nеw York is not for little pussies who scream
If you can't stand thе heat, then get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street

[Chorus]
Other cities always make me mad
Other places always make me sad
No other city ever made me glad except New York
I love New York
I love New York
I love New York
I love New York
Get off my street, get off my street
I love New York
Get off my street, get off my street
I love New York
Get off my street, get off my street
I love New York
Get off my street, get off my street
I love New York
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Other cities always make me mad
Other places always make me sad
No other city ever made me glad except New York
I love New York
I love New York
I love New York

[Outro]
I love New York
Get off my street, get off my street
I love New York
Get off my street, get off my street
I love New York
Get off my street, get off my street
I love New York
Get off my street, get off my street
I love New York
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Get off my street, get off my street
Off my, off my, off my, off my, off my...

[Intro]
Oh, whoa, whoa
Mmm (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high
It's like we go through the same shit every night
Oh, why? Oh, why?
You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high
It's like we go through the same shit every night
Oh, why? Oh, why?
You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does

[Verse]
Tell me that you're gonna change
Tell me that it's different now, but girl this shit still feel the same
I don't evеn feel the same way that I did beforе
Maybe it's myself I have to blame
I let this go on for way too long
Why-y-y, I want your love, but baby, I-I-I
You make it hard and you won't try-y-y
I guess that time will tell
You tell me that you'll change, but I know that you never will

[Chorus]
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high
It's like we go through the same shit every night
Oh, why? Oh, why?
You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does
Why? You'll only say you love me when you're high
It's like we go through the same shit every night
Oh, why? Oh, why?
You always swear that shit's gonna change, but it never does

[Verse 1]
Just one kiss on my lips
Was all it took to seal the future
Just one look from your eyes
Was like a certain kind of torture
Once upon a time
There was a boy
And there was a girl
Just one touch from your hands
Was all it took to make me falter

[Chorus]
Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together?
Forbidden love, forbidden love
Forbidden love, we seal the destiny forever
Forbidden love, forbiddеn love

[Verse 2]
Just one smile on your facе
Was all it took to change my fortune
Just one word from your mouth
Was all I needed to be certain
Once upon a time
There was a boy
There was a girl
Hearts that intertwine
They lived in a different kind of world

[Chorus]
Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together?
Forbidden love, forbidden love
Forbidden love, we seal the destiny forever
Forbidden love, forbidden love

[Interlude]
Just one kiss (Five)
Just one touch (Four)
Just one look (Three)
(Two)

[Chorus]
Forbidden love (One), are we supposed to be together?
Forbidden love, forbidden love
Forbidden love, we seal the destiny forever
Forbidden love, forbidden love
Forbidden love, are we supposed to be together?
Forbidden love, forbidden love
Forbidden love, we seal the destiny forever
Forbidden love, forbidden love

[Outro]
Just one kiss (Five)
Just one touch (Four)
Just one look (Three)
Just one love (Two)
(One)

[Verse 1]
I don't like cities, but I like New York

Baby, you can keep, baby, you can keep

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh

[Verse 1]
Don't know what to say
One look and then you blew me away
I'm spiraling all over the place
So lifted, got me reaching for grace
Body off the ground
Caught me by surprise
Like seeing shootin' stars in the sky
There's danger in the dark of your eyes
But something 'bout you brings me to life
Got me here and now

[Pre-Chorus]
Heartbreak already hit me once
They say that it won't happen twice

[Chorus]
You struck me down like lightning, lightning
You struck me down like lightning, lightning
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uhh
So tell mе what you want and I'ma give it to ya
Like lightning
Blinded, blindеd
You took me down, I don't mind it, mind it
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uhh
So tell me what you want and I'ma give it to ya
Like lightning

[Verse 2]
Electrified with love on the line
So different, every touch, every time
Connected by invisible wires
Don't you cut me out, whoa

[Pre-Chorus]
Heartbreak already hit me once
So swear that it won't happen twice

[Chorus]
You struck me down like lightning, lightning
You struck me down like lightning, lightning
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uh-uh
So tell me what you want and I'ma give it to ya
Like lightning
Blinded, blinded
You took me down, I don't mind it, mind it
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it (uhh)
So tell me what you want and I'ma give it to ya
Like lightning

[Bridge]
Ah-ah, ah, ah, ah
Tell me what you want, tell me what you want
Lightning, lightning
Give it to ya, I'll give it to ya
Walk away, I'll follow my soul
Blinded, blinded
Yeah, tell me what you want, tell me what you want
Li-li-li-li-li-li-lightning, li-li-li-li-li-li-lightning
Li-lightning
Yeah, li-lightning

[Chorus]
You struck me down like lightning, lightning
You struck me down like lightning, lightning
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uh-uh
So tell me what you want and I'ma give it to ya
Like li-lightning
Blinded, blinded
You took me down, I don't mind it, mind it
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uh-uh
So tell me what you want and I'ma give it to ya
Like lightning

[Verse 1]
Sit around until I find something better to spend my time
But nothing's appealin'
Nothing really lasts that long for me to realize, I'm still alone
And you're not with me
I wonder what's inside your mind, but you seem pretty occupied
So I'll leave it alone
If only I could do the same, share your ways, and I'll change the name
And make it my own

[Chorus]
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?

[Verse 2]
I tried to eat, I tried to sleep, but everything seems boring to me
I don't know what to do
Got two friends that I could see, but they got two jobs and a baby
I just wanna see you
Dependin' on our time apart, thе better the distractions arе
And there isn't a lot
Only took a couple times without you here to realize
But I figured it out

[Chorus]
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?

[Intro]
What's up? It's Faye Webster
I'm here in New York City at Electric Lady Studios with my band
We're gonna play some songs
Thanks for listening

[Verse 1]
I didn't know that I was capable of being happy right now
But you showed me how
I didn't know that you were right in front of me
Until I looked out

[Chorus]
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way

[Verse 2]
You weigh just as much as me, don't you (ah)
I can feel it when we touch
I know you've been having nightmares lately
And I'm sorry I fall asleep first

[Chorus]
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way

[Verse 3]
I didn't know that I was capablе of being happy right now
But you showed me how
I didn't know that you wеre right in front of me
Until I looked out

[Verse 1]
Let's sit around and drink some saké
Then we can argue 'bout the same things
Talk about neighbors on our front porch
I wonder if they know we're moving
Hope they don't know my landlord personally
'Cause I never told him you moved in with me
But fuck him, he kept my money

[Verse 2]
I think your sisters are so pretty
Got drunk and they forgot they met me
I made her laugh one time at dinner
She said I'm funny and then I thanked her
But I know I'm funny haha

[Verse 3]
We go through phases when we're over ours
Right now we both wanna be rockstars
Got you a bass last year on your birthday
The same one the guy from Linkin Park plays
But you look better with it anyways

[Verse 1]
You came here to welcome me
To what is the end
You said if we weren't in love
We’d still be best friends
We both tell the same jokes
Over and over
Wonder if we'll get married
Before my brother

[Chorus]
And let's cheers to you
And let’s cheers to me

[Verse 2]
I like your songs even though
They're not about me
Sometimes I'm scared to show my dad
'Causе you're always cussing

[Chorus]
And let's cheers to you
And let's cheers to mе
And let's cheers to you
And let’s cheers to me

[Verse 1]
How could it all fall in one day?
Were we too sure of the sun?

[Chorus]
If you need to, you can keep time on me
If you need to, you can keep time on me

[Verse 2]
Who knows what State is in store?
If they all turn, will you run?

[Chorus]
If you need to, you can keep time on me
If you need to, you can keep time on me

[Post-Chorus]
When I need to, I'll keep time on you

[Bridge]

[Wide / white] oceans roar
A frightened fool stokes to the

[Heedless/heatless] fire

[Chorus]
But if you need to, you can keep time on me
If you need to, you can keep time on me
If you need to, you can keep time on me
If you need to, you can keep time on me

[Verse 3]
How could it all fall in one day?
Were we too sure of the sun?

[Chorus]
But if you need to, you can keep time on me
If you need to, you can keep time on me

[Verse 1]
Who loved you first?
Who loved you last?
Why do I even think of these things?
'Cause I've always been the type to see all the bad before all the good things
Haven't written the song in a minute
Haven't been in love in forever
But I'm looking at you, you're looking at me at every single possible angle

[Chorus]
And it's not like how you make me feel
I don't feel this kind of type of way
And it's not like how you make me feel
I don't feel this kind of type of way

I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way

[Verse 2]
Ask what you want, ask what you need
I'll tell you еvеrything that I know
I'm hoping that you won't ever lеave
'Causе there's nowhere else I wanna go

[Chorus]
And it's not like how you make me feel
I don't feel this kind of type of way
And it's not like how you make me feel
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way
I don't feel this kind of type of way

[Verse 1]
The day that I met you I started dreaming
Now I write 'em down if I remember in the morning time
I don't know that much about Kingston
But I like the sound it makes when it starts pouring rain
I think that tonight I'll leave my light on
'Cause I get lonely when it's out and I miss you right about now

[Chorus]
Baby tell me where you want to go
Baby tell me what you want to know
Give you everything I have and more

[Verse 2]
He said baby, that's what he called me, I love you
Every single word you say makes me feel some typе of way
It's the thought of you that slightly scares me
But it takеs my breath away, forget what I was gonna say
The day that I met you I started dreaming
Now I write 'em down if I remember in the morning time

[Chorus]
Baby tell me where you want to go
Baby tell me what you want to know
Give you everything I have and more
Baby tell me where you want to go
Baby tell me what you want to know
Give you everything I have and more
Baby tell me where you want to go
Baby tell me what you want to know
Give you everything I have and more

[Intro]
One, two
One, two, three, four
You are the light of my world
Don't need to try so hard
Dreaming of time on my hands
Changing the ways I fall

[Verse 1]
I want you
But I don't want your reasons why
You can't even look me in my eye
I told you
So don't you make me say it one more time, one more time, like

[Pre-Chorus]
When you went away
Moonlight took the day, day
Stars and darkness all collided
In the loneliest of space

[Chorus]
Will you stand, stand, stand, stand?
Will you stand, stand, stand, stand, stand, stand?

[Verse 2]
Can you stand the rain? Yeah, baby
When summer's gone and there's no use in
Weighing it out all the time all in vain
Seeping deeper into blame

[Pre-Chorus]
When you went away
Moonlight took the day
Stars and darkness all collided
In the loneliest of space

[Chorus]
Will you stand, stand, stand?
Or will you falter
Will you lean into the timeless bending
Never-ending strength in your heart
Or will you prosper
Will you recover after all the love
You've lost and lost again
Will you stand, stand, stand, stand, woo?
Will you stand, stand, stand?

[Bridge]
The universe defined it over all of me (Yeah, yeah)
And I've been looking deep into my soul (Ooh)
Finding my reflection in the mercury (Mercury)
And turning, turning my transgressions into gold (Whoa, whoa)
Knew you would be miles away (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh

[Outro]
But baby we don't have to  run so hard
You're nothing to fuck with
They see it in the way we are
And they can't realign the stars, no
You're nothing to fuck with
They see it in the way we are
But we don't have to run so hard (Run so hard, run so hard, run so hard, hard)
And call me crazy, but they see it in the way we are (Way we are, way we are, way we are, are)
Listen baby, we don't have to run so hard (Run so hard, run so hard, run so hard, hard)
And call me crazy, but they see it in the way we are (Way we are, way we are, way we are, are)
So come on baby, yeah
Can you stand the rain?
Make it through all the things they say (Hey, yeah)

[Verse 1: PinkPantheress]
It's eight o’clock in the morning, now I'm entering my bed
Had a few dreams about you, I can't tell you what we did
I expected to see you on your morning run again
I know I shouldn’t be watching, 'cause every time I feel the pain

[Refrain: PinkPantheress]
La, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la

[Verse 2: Powfu]
I still see you live at home, when I run by your house
Feels like it was yesterday, that I lived on your couch
Never had a girl like you, you know how to make me cry
Should've talked about our problems
But we pushed them to the side
Saw your FaceTime at 1:05, I wouldn't answer
'Cause if I see your face again, I'll wanna see you after
Could've done it all, girl, you had me
I don't wanna be with you if you’re not happy

[Verse 2: PinkPantheress, Powfu, & Both]
You told me it wasn’t over
Didn't wanna let you go
But was this before or after
I was slowly losing hope
I used to think we’d make it far
I thought we made it too
It's such a shame that we weren't the same at all

[Refrain: PinkPantheress & Powfu]
La, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la-la-la, la-la

La, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la

[Verse 3: Powfu]
If you need anything, girl, just ask me
I know we both got a past, but it's past me
I ain’t holding any grudges, so do not as well
Wish that we could still be friends, 'cause I ain't doing well
(We'll still be friends)

[Verse]
Some days when I'm down just a little bit, I drop myself to the floor
It's not a problem if it hurts because I can't feel ache anymore
I only came back home because I wanted to see what's changed
And then I realised everyone's gone, but I still feel the same

[Chorus]
I wasn't meant to be
This bored at nineteen
My friend lived next to me
Now she won't wanna see
Me look differently
Now that I'm nineteen

[Post-Chorus]
Nineteen
Nineteen
Now that I'm nineteen
Nineteen

[Bridge]
My mind, my mind, my mind's alone be-be-because I'm a-a-a—
My mind, my mind, mind's alone be-be-because I'm a-a-a— (Enough the lot, I've had enough)
My mind, my mind, mind's alone be-be-because I'm a-a-a— (The gore, the pain, I've had so much, I love to hate)
My mind, my mind, mind's alone because I'm— (The way I shaped because I'm hurt and living rough)

[Chorus]
Wasn't meant to be (The gore, the pain, I've had so much, I love to hate)
(The way I shaped because I'm hurt and living rough)
And I'm never enough, nineteen
My friend lived next to me
Now she won't wanna see
Me look differently
Now that I'm nineteen

[Verse 1]
I never wanted to cast doubt in your mind
I'm not actin' the way I think you'd like
We went for dinner and now you're actin' paranoid
If only you knew the way I felt inside on that night

[Refrain]
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2]
Your paranoia, it happens all the time
And that's 'cause lying's a big problem of mine
But I still do it, now I'm by myself again
I tell so many that I can't see them end, so I said

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could, I would make amends
Today, I wrote a list of them
The way it starts, the way it ends
I signed my name in marker pen

[Chorus]
I must apologise
Before I end the night

[Post-Chorus]
It's not a game, I want to change
These days, it doesn't feel the same
The way it did some years before
I've lost so much, I'll lose some more

[Verse 3]
I'm not able
To tell you what you need, it's a shame 'cause
They say I should be honest more, one day, I'm sure
I'll figure out the reason I was tellin' lies for

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Intro]
I'll count the stars tonight
I'll count the stars tonight

[Verse 1]
I crashed my car right into a tree
I'd risk my life for a chance you'd come back to me
You called 999, then left me to bleed
I know you'd never cause an accident for me

[Chorus]
I'll count the stars tonight

[Verse 2]
So last Valentine's, you spent it away
To be with a girl you said you never saw that way
It hurts not to smile, it hurts more to breathe
It makes me so angry, all I do is grit my teeth
I still let this man take over me
But I know that I'm not the one it should be
I should really take some time instead
To figure why this plays out again and again

[Chorus]
I'll count thе stars tonight (Woah, woah)
I'll count the stars tonight (Woah, woah)

[Outro]
I'll count the stars tonight
I'll count the stars tonight
I'll count thе stars tonight (Woah, woah)
I'll count the stars tonight (Woah, woah)

I'll count the stars tonight (Woah, woah)
I'll count the stars tonight (Woah, woah)

You called 999, then left me to bleed

[Verse 2]
So last Valentine's, you spent it away

[Verse 1]
Said I had to clear out my head
But tonight, I think I lost the plot instead
I said that I'd be cleared out by three
To the walls, I know they listen to me
My teachers always called it a shame
They say I don't have passion the same
As I did a few years before
They don't see the light there anymore

[Chorus]
They call it sad, but they're the outside lookin' in
I mean, they can't understand when they all cope with everything
And when I opened my heart in front of my friends finally
It was not what I thought 'cause they're not there anymore
I called my dad, he told me there's no room for me
Down at the house that we had when we were living as a three
Now that my family's gone, almost as far as I can see
I think they love me, I'm sure, but they're not there anymore

[Break]
(Where can I sleep tonight?)
(I don't have passion the same)

[Verse 2]
I'm breakin' them in half, they always say
I never wanted them to end this way
And now I have to gather all my things
They don't want the problems that I bring

[Break]
(Where can I sleep tonight?)

[Chorus]
They-they-they call it sad, but they're the outside lookin' in
I mean, they can't understand when they all cope with everything
And when I opened my heart in front of my friends finally
It was not what I thought 'cause they're not there anymore

[Break]
(Where can I sleep tonight?)

[Chorus]
They call it sad, but they're the outside lookin' in
I mean, they can't understand when they all cope with everything
And when I opened my heart in front of my friends finally
It was not what I thought 'cause they're not there anymore
I called my dad, he told me there's no room for me
Down at the house that we had when we were living as a three
Now that my family's gone, almost as far as I can see
I think they love me, I'm sure, but they're not there anymore

[Intro: PinkPantheress]
(Me, me, me, me)
Do you wipe them just for me? (Me, me, me, me)
I'm pleading on my knees (Knees, knees, knees, knees)
It's your touch that I need (Need, need, need, need)

[Verse 1: PinkPantheress]
I found the street of the house in which you stay
And my diary's full of your name on every page
'Cause I read somewhere you'll fall in love with me
I'll try and try again, one day you'll see
Your hair's under my pillow so I sleep (So I sleep)
And I'm dreaming of you leaving roses at my feet (At my feet)

[Chorus: PinkPantheress]
I'm obsessed with you in a way I can't believe
When you wipe your tears do you wipe them just for me? (Mе, me, me, me)
Do you wipе them just for me? (Me, me, me, me)
I'm pleading on my knees (Knees, knees, knees, knees)
It's your touch that I need (Need, need, need, need)

[Verse 2: El Guincho]
Hoy te seguí no me vayas a matar
Quería verte de lejos al pasar
Si te dabas cuenta yo me iba a morir
Un día aprenderé a disimular
Te escrito algo ¿Quieres escuchar?
Ven sola que no es para nadie más
Y si tú te pusieras a llorar
Dime que eres solo para mí
Es solo para mí (Mí, mí, mí)

[Chorus: PinkPantheress with El Guincho]
(Knees, knees, knees, knees)
It's your touch that I need (Need, need, need, need)

[Outro: PinkPantheress]
Just for you

[Intro]
(O.J.C)

[Verse 1]
It was early last week, you said we didn't really have that much in common
But what did you really gain from it?
We split in two, now you don't want me
Now it's the start of July
You thought that you broke my heart and now every time that you see me you vanish
'Cause you assumed you really mattered
But I was sound, I had a pattern
Now you're a burden of mine

[Verse 2]
Did you notice I cried, but only just a little bit? (Yeah)
Tell you I lied, then split down in the middle
'Cause you're taking one side, not the side that I like
Because you know I can't lie whеn you're in my mind
You're too cruel to bе kind and I know that from experience
I can hear your replies, but it's maybe that I'm hearin' things
And I heard all your lies, there's no lies that I like
So I'll take that as a sign, you're a burden of mine (Hey)

[Refrain]
Mi-i-ine
Mi-i-ine
Burden of mi-i-ine, mi-i-ine
Mi-i-ine, of mine
Mi-i-ine
Mi-i-ine
Burden of mi-i-ine, mi-i-ine
Mi-i-ine, of mine

[Verse 2]
Did you notice I cried, but only just a little bit? (Yeah)
Tell you I lied, then split down in the middle

[Verse 1]
I wrote this letter to remind myself the reasons I'm alive
I got to reason number five
With my pen, I wrote on and I tried
To find words that described all the times
I caught myself and realised there are good things just ahead of me
But right now, it gets hard to believe
But I know that I'm safe when I leave

[Chorus]
And you can't speak to me
And when I can't receive
The words I know you mean
Anything can sеt me free

[Verse 2]
And I was broken, but a little part of mе thinks that I'm glad
I can go through things that make me sad
It's the only time off that I've had
Any more, then I start to go mad
Reason that I had at number one (Was I liked you)
Know the feeling well of being loved (Then number two)
I like the feeling of becoming numb (I can't choose)
Which one I prefer because you can't

[Chorus]
Speak to me
And when I can't receive
The words I know you mean
Anything can set me free (It's better you leave me be)

[Outro]
Reason that I had at number one (Was I liked you)

[Verse 1]
Did you ever want me? No worries if not
It's just that I told my mum, she thinks we're still going strong
She knows that I'm so fond of you that she can't ignore
How every day she knocks, but I don't answer my door
Every time I look outside my house, I try to make myself believe
(I can look at nature and feel good again)
You just call and text to say, "I want to talk," but I'm too scared to meet
(Is that why you think the worst of me?)

[Chorus]
Say we'll make up
Why'd you say that?
Why'd you break her?
('Cause I never got to teach myself at all)
How to not show myself, let go
All my friends know
That you think the worst of me

[Refrain]
('Cause I never got to teach myself at all)
('Cause I never got to teach myself at all)

[Verse 2]
Even though you broke my heart
Now we're living worlds apart
Now I've blocked you since I'm smart
(Never got to teach myself at all)
Now that all that's done and said
I see all the time I spent
Not talking to my best friend
'Cause I thought the worst of me

[Instrumental Break]

'Cause I thought the worst of me

Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
Get back in po-

[Verse]
The world in a panic, the women is stranded, the men on the run
The profits abandoned, the law take advantage
The market is crashing, the industry wants
Niggas and bitches to sleep in a box while they making a mockery following us
This ain't Monopoly, watch you pull up
This ain't Monogamy, ya'll getting fucked
Jump in the "what the hell is that?" I gotta relax when I feel (huh, facts)
All my descendants, they come in my sleep and say I am too real (huh, facts)
I'm done with the sensitive, taking it personal
Done with the black and the white, thе wrong and the right
You hopin' for change, incurring-
Lyrics from snippet

[Verse]
Bitch, i'm attractive
Handsome ass ugly nigga, attractive
Fuck whos hot (hoe)

Not to stun on niggas (alright)

When it's too much, there's a gun to my head

Real talk with my demons lately
Real talk in the mirror, save me
When it's too much, gotta live life good, appreciate it

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing is forever, lucky to remember
Stay up in the moment, all night, all night, yeah

[Chorus]
All the things I love are gonna leave me
One day you're nеver gonna be therе
I tell myself to take it easy
Don't think twice about it, baby
Up on the hill, we'll see it all end
Die happy thinking 'bout my best friends
'Til then I'm diving off the deep end
"Don't think twice about it," I say

[Post-Chorus]
Don't think twice, don't think twice
Don't, don't, don't think twice

My hair stood on end
Who's that lady so lovely
Like poetry in motion
I play by the rules (Play by the rules)
I mean no disrespect (No disrespect)
You're the kind of girl
That'll make a man stop and turn his head

[Chorus]
Don't mean no sexual harassment (I don't)
But I just can't help it (I can't help it)
I get those elevator eyes (Oh oh), those elevator eyes (Oh oh)
As you go walkin' by (Walkin' by)
I say my oh my oh my (My, my, my)
I get those elevator eyes (I get those elevator eyes)

[Verse 2]
Your body foundation is really out of sight
Your hair and your clothes
Everything is just right
I inspect you like a general does his army
Close order drill girl
Girl, you look so damn charming

[Chorus]
Don't mean no sexual harassment (I don't)
But I just can't help it (I can't help it)

Now I know just how a woman must feel (Now I know)
A woman wants respect for who she is (For who she is)
I still believe that a woman wants to be told
She's an angel of mercy
Full of surprises
So full of love, there's no denying

Oh, yeah
No, no, no

[Chorus]
Don't mean no sexual harassment (I get those eyes)
But I just can't help it (I can't help it)
I get those elevator eyes (Oh), I get those elevator eyes

I get those elevator eyes (I get those elevator eyes)

My, my, my, my, my, my
Don't mean no sexual harassment (I get those eyes)
But I just can't help it (Elevator eyes)
I get those elevator eyes, I get those elevator eyes (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
As you go walkin' by (Oh, oh) (Walkin' by)
I say my oh my oh my (It's just something that you do to me)
I get those elevator eyes (I get those elevator eyes)

Don't mean no sexual harassment (Just can't help it, baby)
But I just can't help it
I get those elevator eyes, I get those elevator eyes
As you go walkin' by

[Intro: Otis Williams]
Detroit, Michigan
The year? 1960
Motown Records
At that time, my group was called Otis Williams and the Distants
Now, we were recording for a little small label
Getting ready to do for you, called 'Come On'
Now, 'Come On' did quite a bit of business, maybe somewhat of a ruckus
So much so that we used to have to do record hops
Now, record hops is when you have a record out
You have to go 'round to whatever noted disc jockey was having on Friday or Saturday, even a Sunday
Um, gathering, you'd have to go there so you can get your rеcord played
So this one particular night, we wеre at St. Steven's Community Centre
The Distants were on stage, so we're doing 'Come On' and people are going crazy
But enter walk Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, who are with Mr. Berry Gordy
Now, Smokey and them were very hot, because they had, uh, 'Shop Around' out
So, when the audience finally let us up, 'because they kept us on, calling us back for two-to-three different times
And when we finally came off, I'm standing in the crowd, watching Smokey and the Miracles
It just so happened Mr. Gordy was standing next to me, and he said
"Man, I like that record you guys have out. Come see me, I'm starting my label"
And as fate would have it, I kept it, kept the card, and it didn't go too well for the label that we were recording
So I call Mickey Stevenson, who was the A&R man for Motown, and I told him Mr. Gordy wanted us to come over and we did just that
And I would like to say, the reason we are doing this record is because it is the pre-eminence of telling the Temptations' life story
Because at that time in 1964, entered Melvin Franklin, David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks was there, Paul Williams was there, myself, Otis Williams
And when Smokey wrote 'The Way You Do The Things You Do', which was 1964, would you believe this is 2021, and we're still hanging on
So this is our 60th anniversary album
Never would imagine that we would get this far for so long
But you know how it is, love can stretch a mile before it tear an inch
And, uh, here we are
So, Mr. Gordy, I know you will hear this
Smokey's gon' play you what he did on this album
I wanna say to you, Mr. Gordy, thank you for being there at the right time and right place
'Cause God is always everywhere, and that point in time, He was there for us to make history with you, Motown, and become part of something that will live on forever
So, David Ruffin (Ain't too proud to beg), Eddie Kendricks (Just my imagination), Paul Williams (For once in my life), Melvin Franklin (And that ain't right), Dennis Edwards (Papa was a rollin' stone), and all the other Temps (My girl, my girl, my girl) that are no longer of this earth
My wonderful friend, Ron Tyson, who's been with me for a long time, and Terry Weeks
I would be remiss if I didn't mention some of these guys, so I just wanna let you know, aside from Berry, given us this point of time, this wonderful time of being here, I love you all
Thank you for your support, and to all our many wonderful fans for being
You know my saying when I get ready to leave
See ya, later gone, God bless
(Aah, please, please, please, please
Please, please, please, please
Please, please, please, please) Well
(Please, please, please)

[Verse 1]
It happens all the time
“I’ll see you later”
You walk back in my life
This is an indicator
It’s all the time
It’s all the time
It happens all the time
“Guess this is it”
She said
“I don’t know what’s in your head
“What’s up with this?
“Put it to bed
“But you keep coming back”

[Chorus]
First you know
Then you go
Tell it all over
With shame to shoulder
What’s the trouble now
Spill the tea
And what’d you get
Lead it all back to you
Every time
But you do it all again

[Sample]

[Verse 2]
It happens all the time
You chit and chatter
Then walk back in my life
Act like it doesn’t matter
It’s all the time
It’s all the time
It happеns all the time

[Chorus]
First you know
Then you go
Tеll it all over
With shame to shoulder
What’s the trouble now
Spill the tea
And what’d you get
Lead it all back to you
Every time
But you do it all again

[Verse 3]
You don’t know
You won’t see
Everything inside of me
Letting go
Of the stone
That you throw
Hurts to follow me
Hurts to follow me
Hurts to follow me

[Chorus]
You should've been downtown (Word)
The people are risin' (For real?)
We thought it was a lockdown (What?)
They opened the fire (Man)
Them bullets was flyin' (Ooh)
Who said it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie

[Verse 1]
Oh my
Time heals all, but you out of time now (Now)
Judge gotta watch us from the clock tower (True)
Lil' tear gas cleared the whole place out
I'll be back with the hazmat for the next round
We was tryna protest, then the fires broke out
Look out for the secret agents, they be planted in the crowd
Said, "It's civil unrest," but you sleep so sound
Like you don't hear the screams when we catchin' beatdowns?
Stayin' quiet when they killin' ****, but you speak loud
When we riot, got opinions comin' from a place of privilege
Sicker than the COVID how they did him on the ground
Speakin' of the COVID, is it still goin' around?
And won't you tell me 'bout the lootin'? What's that really all about?
'Cause they throw away Black lives like paper towels
Plus unemployment rate, what, forty million now?
Killed a man in broad day, might never see a trial
We just wanna break chains like slaves in the South
Started in the North End but we in the downtown
Riot cops tried to block, now we got a showdown
(For the city of Los Angeles) Down
(I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly)
(And in the name of the people of the State of California)

[Chorus]
You should've been downtown (Command all those assembled)
The people are risin' (Right here)
We thought it was a lockdown
They opened the fire (Ooh)
Them bullets was flyin'
(Lockdown, we ain't gotta stop because they tell us to)
Who said it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie

[Post-Chorus]
Downtown, where I got popped with the rubber bullet
Trey-pound, got it in my name now, I'ma shoot it

[Verse 2]
Uh, okay, never understand why they do it
Someone cut the channel off the news 'fore I lose it (Nah)
I ain't even trippin', if you with it, then we lootin' (Nah)
Help me put this Louis in the back of Suzuki (Ooh), oh-he
Had to break it down so smoothly (Smooth)
They gon' say, "It's not about race," but we movin', oh, power
Copped the trey-pound, had to put that in my name
Wish a **** play now (Yeah)
Any given day, I'll be headed to the pulpits (Yeah)
Say a lil' prayer, matter fact, I need two of 'em, ooh
Won't he do it? Won't he do it?
Ooh, this ain't '92, so we into new rules
Then we got hip, so we don't loot the projects
'Bout to hit Rodeo with my lil' cousin Marcus
Someone threw a whole brick in the Neiman Marcus (Ah)
Help me put the whole mannequin in the Charger

[Chorus]
You should've been downtown (Down)
The people are risin' (Look around)
We thought it was a lockdown (Lockdown)
They opened the fire (Had to get low, fire)
Them bullets was flyin' (Down, down)
Who said it was a lockdown? Goddamn lie (Ooh-wee)

[Post-Chorus]
Lockdown, we ain't gotta stop 'cause they tell us to
Downtown, where I got popped with the rubber bullet
Trey-pound (Uh), got it in my name now, I'ma shoot it
Lockdown, we ain't gotta stop 'cause they tell us to
Downtown

[Verse 1]
I don't always wake up in the mornin'
Pour myself a strong one
Aw, but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets burnin'
Lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you

[Pre-Chorus]
Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault
Yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all I've wasted on you

[Chorus]
All of this time and all of this money
All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wastеd on you
Wasted on you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I swore this onе'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learning the hard way again
That's why I've been wasted on you

[Chorus]
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

[Bridge]
Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you, ooohhh
Wasted on you, ooohhh
Wasted on you

[Chorus]
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

[Outro]
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Ooohhh

[Verse 1]
A 'Bama red 4Runner pulled into the party
With a 30-A sticker on the back windshield
Two-tone tank top slippin' off her shoulder
Kinda girl when she steps out, the world stands still

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I know where this is goin'
I already know it

[Chorus]
She's somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's
About to be mine
About to be mine

[Verse 2]
Kinda girl once you've had her, you can't stand to lose her
Kinda girl where your friends tell you don't F it up
Kinda girl that goes from tryin' to just to get her number
To slidin' through the summer to talkin' 'bout love

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I think I'm likin' where it's goin'
I'd like to try me some of

[Chorus]
Somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's
About to be mine
About to be mine

[Bridge]
Oh, hey baby, don't just keep me wishin'
Oh, let me get to fixin'

[Chorus]
Somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's
About to be mine
About to be mine
About to be mine
About to be mine

[Verse 1]
I could see me sittin' in the back of a cop car bangin' my head on a window
I could see me slammin' that last call shot glass, losin' everything in my billfold
Ooh, ooh
That's what I do when I'm drinkin' 'bout you

[Chorus]
So, I don't wanna go downtown doin' what we used to
Twist the top off another round, hell I got enough loose screws
I’m gettin' tired of hurtin' 'bout you
Nothin' ever changes
I think I'm gonna stay right here tonight
'Cause that could be dangerous
'Cause that could be dangerous

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I could see me doin' just fine with a Daisy Duke dime but I don't see it lastin' long
I could see me orderin' too many drinks at the bar
Get the bartender pourin' 'em strong
That's what I do when I'm tryna drink you gonе

[Chorus]
So, I don't wanna go downtown doin' what we used to
Twist the top off anothеr round, hell I got enough loose screws
I’m gettin' tired of hurting 'bout you
Nothin' ever changes
I think I'm gonna stay right here tonight
'Cause that could be dangerous
'Cause that could be dangerous

[Bridge]
Yeah, 'cause you
Got somebody else that you've been foolin'
Them same tricks up your sleeve, yeah
Ooh
I'd usually be the type to be out too
But you ruined that for me, so

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go downtown doin' what we used to
Twist the top off another round, hell I got enough loose screws
I’m gettin' tired of hurting' 'bout you
Nothin' ever changes
I think I'm gonna stay right here tonight
'Cause that could be dangerous
That could be dangerous
Dangerous
That could be dangerous

[SUN-WON & KRS-One]
Yo check your mic, let's check these levels
Check check check check
Ok word we got the sound, let me know when the break is coming in
Nah, there's no break I am just going straight through
Aight kick that shit

[KRS-One]
Heaven-sent I can prove this
Any crowd turn me up loud, KR will move this
Long before Eazy-E was MC, he was ruthless
Kickin rhyme, spittin 'rhyme, freestyle, I does this who's this
You don't know me homie I am the one and only
I turn you two into a toll and tell you, you owe me
You ain't gotta go to the past to know me homie
I'm KRS-One, my power is now: Eckhart Tolle
These rappers are phony and lonely
I catch 'em coming out of show me's
I don't Oscar or admire they baloney
No phony, I spit for the time from the mind
So when I spit off the head of course I am ahead of my time
Yes I'm better with rhyme and it's evident I'm
The lyrically benevolent kind, this shit you never gonna find
I am spitting plenty medleys, this is work not a job
Rappers are crying like a boss or a verse they soft
That is when they get robbed and disappointed
They not anointed, I get em set up like an appointment
I spit the same heat you light the joint with, fire
Spit the truth no liar, heaven-sent this is higher
The might cooks, I write books, the heavyweight champion
This song becomes a knockout with the right hook
I'm raw, meaning not cooked
These fake rappers heads are down
Because into the face of KRS they do not look
40 cal. style, rampampam like big drums
When I heat up the cup of the 420 it's done
Light up the Cheech with the Chong, I teach when I come
Knowledge reign is supreme what these rappers is speaking is dumb
It's a treat when I come, I'm not what you used to
I'm the return of Khufu all over these tracks like "Choo-Choo"
I am the Guru, so when my teaching premiers it's Gang Starr
Hitting you and your man in the same car
These wack rappers, fuck who they are
KRS is like a hooligan, hittin’ em all with the same bars
Hooligans, hittin' em with the same bars
Yo' wack style just ain’t ours, Venus to Mars
I’m teaching with bars, spitting these bars
But young'ns under 21 can’t even get into these bars
So I don’t blame 'em if they not seeing these bars
‘Cause when I hit 'em with my universe all they seeing is stars
Speaking of bars when I spit one
You can see it's all about impact over an income
The big one, multi-directional and exceptionable
10 of my first 20 albums are all collectable
You feel the heat when I am next to you truly legendary
Underground undetectable and revolutionary
Most of what is going on today, you know we knew already
I try to teach our people of poverty
And took to many and shook to many
We can see what a curse is so I reemerge
Show these young'ns who the first is
The minister, frying rap chickens like churches
And the worst is seeing your temperature taken by nurses
IV-bags, your family picking out hearses
It's like you at the ball-place center and you won't survive these verses
Sprite means spirit so I obey what my thirst is
The whole planet of this so called Earth is what my turf is
KRS-One..

[SUN-WON]
Ok ok, hold on hold on, I got this
This shit is gon' be fire
Levels is on point
You sound good out here
Let's get this project started
Darling, you need to calm down
And every time we fighting
You lose control, ride it
Your snapping go, violent

[Verse]
Why you always doin' that?
Breakin' up with me, then makin' up
Just to make me mad

[Pre-Chorus]
I think that you taste like rock candy
Sweet like beaches, leave me all sandy
Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes?
Young love don't always last forever
Wild horses can't keep us together
So what if you taste just like heaven?
That don't make it right
Hot summer and cold watermelon
Your love stings like blood and a lemon
Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes?

[Chorus]
Watеrcolor eyes
Watercolor еyes
Watercolor eyes
That don't make it right
That don't make it right

I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 909

Said she's traveling on the one after 909

Pick up my bag, run to the station

Pick up my bag, run right home

[Hook]
I wanna be the president
I wanna be the president
Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song they're playin' on the radio
Let's sway
While color lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run
I'll run with you
And if you say hide
We'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance
Let's dance
For fear your grace should fall
Let's dance
For fear tonight is all
Let's sway
You could look into my еyes
Let's sway
Under thе moonlight, this serious moonlight
And if you say run
I'll run with you
And if you say hide
We'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's sway
Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance, dance, dance

[Chorus: Vory]
Lord, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, oh, lift me up
Lord, lift me up, I've had enough
I've had too much
Too much, I don't seem to do much
Too much, I don't seem to do nothin'
Lord, lift me up, oh, lift me up
Lift me up, oh, lift me up
Lord, lift me up, lift me up
Oh, lift me up, lift me, lift me up

[Verse: Vory]
I pray what you wanted to be
Just takin' whatever You wanted from me
It turns out I want it to me
I'll take You wherever You wanted to be
The burden is all on to me
You're givin' them just what they wanted to see
They wanna see the family feud
But I can't let the family lose
They strugglin', like back and forth, like me and you

[Chorus Reprise: Vory]
Oh, Lord, I call on You to
Lift me up, oh, lift me up, oh, lift me up
Oh, Lord, I call on You to

No strings attached, that's Bluetooth
That's you, too, sorry, sorry, true

Magic
Magic

One dream, one soul, one prize, one goal
One golden glance of what should be
(It's no good)
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day

The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
Is this a kind of magic
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done

This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn (ahhh) of sanity
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooooh)
This is (this is) a kind (a kind) of magic
Therе can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand yеars
Will soon be, will soon be, will soon be done
This is a kind of magic
A kind of magic

All the boughs were broken
All the branches bare
Waiting for the snow to melt
Then hope to find them there

[Verse 2]
All the words unopened
Brimming like a crown
Saw you standing at the crossroads
Staring through the clouds
Well, can we stay here longer?
Burn our embers down
Glowing bright for one last moment
Just to fade somehow

[Verse 3]
All the while, the roads are bending
Still I don't know where

No, no, no, no
Don't you let me let you go

We comin' up with rhythms, that's resemblin' glue
(And what about the people that's hatin'?) Quit, look
This is the rebirth of the hip
We hit a motherf***** in the face with raps

Fourteen junkies too weak to work
One sells diamonds for what they're worth
Down on pain street disappointment lurks

All night sentries watch the moon glow

I think I'll pack it in and buy a pick-up
And take it down to L.A
Find a place to call my own and try to fix up
Start a brand new day
The woman I'm thinking of, she loved me all up
But I'm so down today
She's so fine, she's in my mind
I hear her calling
Whoa, oh

[Chorus]
See the lonely boy out on the weekend
Trying to make it pay
Can't relate to joy, he, he tries to speak and
Can't begin to say

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 2]
She got pictures on the wall, they make me look up
From her big brass bed
But now I'm runnin' down the road tryin' to stay up
Somewhere in her head
The woman I'm thinking of, she loved me all up
But I'm so down today
But shе's so fine, she's in my mind
I hear hеr calling
Oh

[Chorus]
See the lonely boy out on the weekend
Trying to make it pay
Can't relate to joy, he tries to speak and
Can't begin to say

[Verse 1]
Did I see you down in a young girl's town
With your mother in so much pain?
I was almost there at the top of the stairs
With her screamin' in the rain

[Chorus]
Did she wake you up to tell you that
It was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man

[Verse 2]
Did I see you walking with the boys?
Though it was not hand in hand
And was some black face in a lonely place
When you could understand?

[Chorus]
Did she wake you up to tell you that
It was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Will I see you give more than I can take?
Will I only harvest some?
As the days fly past, will we losе our grasp?
Or fuse it in the sun?

[Chorus]
Did she wakе you up to tell you that
It was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup
With the promise of a man

[Intro]
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were

[Verse 1]
Old man, look at my life
Twenty-four and there's so much more
Live alone in a paradise
That makes me think of two
Love lost, such a cost
Give me things that don't get lost
Like a coin that won't get tossed
Rolling home to you

[Chorus]
Old man, take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
The whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
And you can tell that's true

[Verse 2]
Lullabies, look in your eyes
Run around the same old town
Doesn't mean that much to me
To mean that much to you
I've been first and last
Look at how the time goes past
But I'm all alone at last
Rolling home to you

[Chorus]
Old man, take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
The whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
And you can tell that's true

[Outro]
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were

[Verse 1]
I want to live, I want to give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions I never give
That keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

[Verse 2]
I've been to Hollywood, I went to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line
That keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold, oh

[Outro]
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
You keep me searchin' and I'm growing old
Keep me searchin' for a heart of gold
I've been a miner for a heart of gold

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Comic book colors on a violin river
Crying a lot of words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away

[Verse 3]
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through the cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone, gone, gonе
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gonе, gone, gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

Thank you

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', I got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin’, like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won’t let you be, oh no

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the street speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the street all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
And sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don’t lay ’em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin’ on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She's lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin’ on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All her friend can say is "Ain't it a shame?"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
You're sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
I got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
Well, I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey,Get back truckin' on
Ah, get back truckin' on
Hey, get back truckin' on
Hey, get back truckin' on, woo

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Old man down
Way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty
Asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

[Verse 2]
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine
More than my maker, though he's no friend of mine

[Verse 3]
Everyone said
I'd come to no good, I knew I would, Pearly, believe them
Half of my life
I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The othеr half found me stumbling around drunk on burgundy wine

[Bridge]
But I'll get back on my feet somеday
The good Lord willing, if He says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should

[Refrain]
I'll get up and fly away
I'll get up and fly away, fly away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
"Pearly's been true
True to me, true to my dying day," he said
I said to him, I said to him, "I'm sure she's been"
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you"

[Verse 5]
I got up and wandered
I wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just hang around
I've got a girl
Named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
Shе can wade in a drop of dew
She don't comе, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
While caught up in sunlight
Now come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Ooh, come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out, and I wander 'round
Walk around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Sunshine daydream, walk you in the tall trees
Going where the wind goes
Blooming, and blooming like a red rose
Now come on over sweetly
And ride out singin'; I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Come on, come on, come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream
Well, coming, coming from a sweet dream
Sunshine daydream, wading in a cold stream
Crawl on out your window
Going where the wind goes
They're never gonna miss us
Ride out, wingin', I'll catch you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream
Well, come on, come on over, daydream
Sunshine daydream
Well, coming, coming from a sweet dream
(Coming from a daydream)
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo, yeah, yeah
Sunshine daydream, coming from a hey, hey
Sunshine daydream, hey, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, hey, hey
Sunshine daydream, hey, hey (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, come on (Come on over, daydream)
Sunshine daydream, hey, hey (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sunshine daydream, hey (Oh, oh, oh)
Thank you all, good night

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy country home
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
There comes a redeemеr, and he slowly too fades away
Follows a wagon behind him that's loadеd with clay
The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
Night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Thanks a lot, folks. See y'all Friday

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my tickets when I speed

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
While caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander around
Walk around

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
As I was walking 'round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter
But a nip to the air
From the other direction
She was calling my eye
It could be an illusion
But I might as well try
Might as well try

[Verse 2]
She had rings on her fingers
And bells on her shoes
I knew without asking
She was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias
Tucked into her curls
I knew right away
She was not like other girls
Other girls

[Verse 3]
In the heat of the evening
When the dеaling got rough
She was too pat to open
And too cool to bluff
As I picked up my matchеs
And was closing the door
I had one of those flashes
I'd been there before
Been there before

[Bridge]
Well, I ain't often right
But I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out
The way it does in the song
Once in a while
You get shown the light
In the strangest of places
If you look at it right

[Verse 4]
There ain't nothing wrong
With the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias
Or a touch of the blues
There's nothing wrong with
The way she caught my eye
I had to learn the hard way
To let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers
Just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing
In the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Instrumental Outro]

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Well, I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I followed you big river when you called

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, I followed her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
A trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
Then I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows when she went on down alone

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, 'cause I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you, big river, more than me

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I taught that weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Outro]
I'm gonna sit right here until I die
I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
To lay me down, once more
To lay me down
With my head in sparkling clover
Let the world go by, like clouds a-streaming
To lay me down, one last time
To lay me down

[Chorus]
To lay me down, whoa-oh
To lay me down
To lay me down, one last time
To lay me down

[Verse 2]
To lie with you, once more
To lie with you
With our dreams entwined together
Let the world go by, all lost in dreaming
To lay me down, one last time
To lay me down

[Chorus]
To lay me down, whoa-oh
To lay me down
To lay me down, one last time
To lay me down

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
To be with you, once more
To be with you
With our dreams bodies close together
Let the world go by, all lost in dreaming
To tell sweet lies, one last time, and say good night

[Chorus]
To lay me down, whoa-oh
To lay me down
To lay me down, one last time
To lay me down

[Outro]
Here's another tragic lament of romance, lost love, and hot lead

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, well, they's all around
With liquor and money, they's loaded down
Soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
Hey, high-low jack and thе winner take the hand

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
My unclе start winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; well, oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
Hey, I'm as honest as a Denver man can be, that's me
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
Well, I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, well, hot damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
You know it, and we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Outro]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, God rest his soul
He taught me good, Lord, he taught me all I know
Taught me so well, well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

[Verse 1]
Julie catch a rabbit by his hair
Come back stepping, like to walk on air
Get back home where you belong
Don't you run off no more

Don't hang your head and let the two time roll
Grass shack nailed to a pine wood floor
Ask the time, baby, I don't know
Come back later, gonna let it show

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Here's a half a dollar if you dare
Double twist when you hit the air
Look at Julie, down below
The levee doing the do-pas-o

[Chorus]
I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Broken heart don't feel so bad
You ain't got half of what you thought you had
Rock your baby to and fro
Not too fast and not too slow

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Bridge]
That's the way it's been in town
Ever since they tore the jukebox down
Two-bit piece don't buy no more
Not so much as it done before

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Outro]
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row
Oh, get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Prelude]

[Instrumental]

[Part 1]

[Verse 1]
Winter rain, now tell me why
Summers fade, and roses die
The answer came
The wind and rain

[Verse 2]
Golden hills, now veiled in gray
And summer leaves have blown away
And what remains? The wind and rain

[Chorus]
And like a desert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (Flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (Flowing)
Flowing 'til the waters all are dry (Flowing)
The loving in her eyes

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Circle songs and sands of time
And seasons will end in tumbled rhyme
And little change
The wind and rain

[Chorus]
And like a desert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (Flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (Flowing)
Flowing 'til the waters all are dry (Flowing)
The loving in her eyes

[Outro]
Winter gray and falling rain
We'll see summer come again
Darkness falls and seasons change
(Gonna happen every time)
Same old friends the wind and rain
(But we'll see summer by and by)
Winter gray and falling rain
(Seasons fade and roses die)
We'll see summer come again
(Oh, it happens every time)
Darkness falls and seasons change
(Seasons change and roses die)
Same old friends the wind and rain
(Oh, like a song that's born to soar the sky)

[Part 2: Let It Grow]

[Verse 1]
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds
Silver beads, pass into the sea

She comes from the town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her

[Refrain]
Let it flow, greatly grow, wide and clear

[Verse 2]
Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again

The plowman is broad as the back of the land he's sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than the planting and growing

[Refrain]
Let it grow, greatly grow, greatly yield

[Bridge]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of man
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Red and white, blue suede shoes
I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do?
Give me five, I'm still alive
Ain't no luck, I learned to duck
Check my pulse, it don't change
Stay seventy-two come shine or rain
Wave the flag, pop the bag
Rock the boat, skin the goat

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Verse 2]
Uncle Sam, that's who I am
Been hiding out in a rock and roll band
Shake the hands that shook the hand
Of P.T. Barnum, and Charlie Chan
Shine your shoes, light the fuse
Can you use them old U.S. Blues
Drink your health, share your wealth
Run your life, steal your wife

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Back to back, chicken shack
Son of a gun, better change your act
We're all confused, what's to lose?
You can call this song the United States Blues

[Chorus]
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

[Outro]
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my
(My, my, my, my, my, my)
Summertime done, come and gone, my, oh, my

Careful folks, the fire marshal is gonna put you out

[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh
And on across Carolin'
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling across the Georgia state
We had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
The Hound broke down
And left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham, woo

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Straight off bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
Thеre's people thеre who care a thing about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I'm working on a T-bone steak a la carte
And flying over to the Golden State
The pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We'd be heading in the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four ten oh nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin’ down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
Goin’ where the climate suits my clothes
Goin' where the climate suits my clothes
Goin' where the climate suits my clothes
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Goin’ where the water tastes like wine
Goin’ where the water tastes like wine
Goin' where the water tastes like wine
I don’t wanna be treated this a-way

[Chorus]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don’t wanna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way
Goin' down the road feeling bad (Woo-hoo)
Goin' down the road feeling bad (Woo-hoo)
Goin' down the road feeling bad, bad, bad
I don't wanna be treated this a-way

[Instrumental]

Thank you all, good night

Okay, okay, okay, okay
Now if you all just shut up a second, we'll play a quiet, tender, meaningful, sympathetic, heavy duty ballad in the key of B-flat. How would you all like it if you had to do your work in a garbage can? Or stick your head in a lion's mouth? That's strictly a personal opinion, you understand

[Verse 1]
Went to see the captain, strangest I could find
Laid my proposition down, laid it on the line
I won't slave for beggar's pay, likewise gold and jewels
But I would slave to learn the way to sink your ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 2]
Saw your first ship sink and drown
From rocking of the boat
And all that could not sink or swim
Was just left there to float
I won't leave you drifting down, but whoa, it makes me wild
With thirty years upon my head to have you call me child

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first beliеved you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruеl sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 3]
The bottle stands as empty
As it was filled before
Time there was and plenty
But from that cup no more
Though I could not caution all
I still might warn a few
Don't lend your hand to raise no flag
Atop no ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Outro]
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools
Thanks a lot, see y'all later
Bye, y'all
Yay-Oh, it's gonna be a long night

Shawty stayed fly, no wings
And she helped me down, no strings
She was the baddest thing I ever seen
She walked right out of my dreams
We took it from one night to day spas
Shopping sprees to new cars
Yeah, we had a good thing
But now you got me thinking

What if I never saw you?
What if I never picked up the phone and called you?
I wish we never made love that day
Oooh, I would turn back the hands of time
I would turn back the hands of time

I wish I had a time machine
We never fort, you never left
I wish I had a time machine to go back, ​way back

We never touched
We never kissed
We never hugged
We never loved
We never met
That was wifey, she ain't need a ring
I don't even know why we were fighting
Damn, I said somethings that I didn't mean
And I wish that I could take it all back now

You pulled out of the driveway
It was storming and raining
Who knew I would never see your face again

I wish I didn't let you leave
(I wish)
What if I would have grabbed those keys?
(What if?)
Maybe then you would be here with me

Oooh, I would turn back the hands of time
I would turn back the hands of time

I wish I had a time machine
We never fort, you never left
I wish I had a time machine to go back, ​way back

We never touched
We never kissed
We never hugged
We never loved
We never met
Uh-Yeah, if loving you ain't right, then I've been wrong
If this is all a test, then I've been strong
If loves a cliffhanger, then I'm hanging on
Click your heals 3 times, baby, come home

Cause who can love you better than Kellz can?
12 Play, he put you up on the nightstand
I wish that I could change the past
And baby, I can't

I wish I had a time machine
We never fort, you never left
I wish I had a time machine to go back, ​way back

We never touched
We never kissed
We never hugged
We never loved
We never met

I wish I had a time machine
We never fort, you never left
I wish I had a time machine to go back, ​way back

We never touched
We never kissed
We never hugged
We never loved
We never met

[Intro]
For the first time in the longest time
For the first time in the longest time
For the first time in the longest time
For the first time in the longest time

[Chorus: Kanye West]
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I could see, I could breathe
Jеsus freed me, Jesus freed me, now I'm free
I got kickеd out the house for takin' sugar out the house
Steady, they don't wanna set me
My doctors on Sebi, my Christ is on heavy
My diamonds on Betty, bossed up, it's on jetty
My diamonds on petty, lightsaber like the Jedi
Somethin' sharp like a metty, born sharp but I'm petty
Pop with the man, the game, the world, the losers sold off
Poppin' the sand, I covered the doors, I give them more, though
This year, I lost my best man and I lost my spouse
Only billionaire you know that's sleeping on the couch (What?)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Let it rain, rain, rain
I need you home for the main
Let it rain, rain, rain
Hold my love, fall in the game
What is they thinkin' again?
What is they lookin' to gain?
Everything is to the future
I know it's just something and bumping in chains, baby

[Chorus: Kanye West & Soulja Boy]
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long (Yeah)
This the first time in a long time (Yeah)
This the first time in a long (Draco)
This the first time in a long time (Soulja)
This the first time in a long

[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]
This the first time in a long time
Used to be broke but I'm on now
I was just stuck at the bottom, grindin'
Now I'm shinin', sittin' at the top
I was just stuck in my feelings
Now I'm just ridin' 'round playin' with millions
Now I'm havin' racks to the ceilin'
Stackin' up cash, what a wonderful feelin'
We used to go walk in the mall to go shop
But now, we can walk in and buy the whole buildin'
We havin' mansions with acres
But honestly, we used to live in the trenches
I'm on fire like a candle
And God ain't gon' give you no fight you can't handle
Back in the trap, we ain't even have cable
Now I see my face on the channel
And R.I.P. Virgil, that OFF-WHITE is on me
The 'Rari, it's swervin'
I went to jail for that Draco
I guess that nobody perfect
Ain't givin' out bond I sat in that cell for a long time
Big Draco, big 'Ye
First time in a long time

[Chorus: Kanye West]
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long
This the first time in a long time
This the first time in a long

[Verse 1]
A hip drag queen and a side-walking street wheeler
Comin' down the avenue
They're all your friends, you'll come to love 'em
There's a load of 'em waiting for you

[Chorus]
Lookout Joe, you're coming home
Old times were good times

[Verse 2]
Remember Millie from down in Philly?
She took my brain and forgot my name
The woman you were with was about the same
She took your money and left town, disappeared

[Chorus]
Lookout, Joe
You're comin' home
Old times werе good times

[Slide Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Glory Hallelujah
Will I lay my burden down?
Singing on thе streets around
Look at that crazy clown
(Look at 'em)

[Guitar Solos]

[Verse 3]
Remember Bill from up on the hill?
A Cadillac put a hole in his arm
But old Bill, he's up there still
Havin' a ball rolling to the bottom

[Chorus]
Lookout, Joe
You're comin' home
Old times were good times
Old times were good times
Bring it

[Verse 1]
Oh, Alabama
The devil fools with the best laid plan
Swing low, Alabama
You got the spare change
You got to feel strange
And now the moment
Is all that it meant

[Chorus]
Alabama
You got the weight on your shoulders
That's breaking your back
Your Cadillac has got a wheel in the ditch
And a wheel on the track

[Verse 2]
Oh, Alabama
Banjos playing through the broken glass
Windows, down in Alabama
See the old folks tied in white robes
Hear the banjo - don't it take you down home?

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Alabama
You got the weight on your shoulders
That's breaking your back
Your Cadillac has got a wheel in the ditch
And a wheel on the track

[Verse 3]
Oh, Alabama
Can I see you and shake your hand?
Make friends down in Alabama
I'm from a new land
I come to you and see all this ruin
What are you doing?

[Chorus]
Alabama
You've got the rest of the Union
To help you along
What's going wrong?

[Intro]
I love your face
You love the taste
That sugar babe, it melts away

[Verse 1]
I hear the sound of that wrapper coming off, yeah
The wrapper getting off, going off for your love
Licking on the lollipop, yeah, the wrapper coming off
So much sugar in your touch
Hope you ready for this jelly, put the fire in my belly
Now we pop, rock, steady, steady
Really hot, show me all you got
Boy I can't get enough, I'm addicted to this love

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me coming, keep me going
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning
Don't stop loving 'til the morning, don't stop loving 'til the morning
Don't stop screaming, freaking, blowing

[Chorus]
Can you eat my skittles?
It's the sweetest in the middle (Yeah)
Pink is the flavor
Solve the riddle (Yeah)
I'ma lean back
Don't worry, it's nothing major
Make sure you clean that
It's the only way to get the
Flavor

[Verse 2]
When you're thirsty and need love
I give it up 'til I'm empty, babe
Must be good to you
If you're lonely in your bed, fill it up to the top
Must be good to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me coming, keep me going
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning
Don't stop loving 'til the morning, don't stop loving 'til the morning
Don't stop screaming, freaking, blowing

[Chorus]
Can you eat my skittles?
It's the sweetest in the middle (Yeah)
Pink is the flavor
Solve the riddle (Yeah)
I'ma lean back
Don't worry, it's nothing major
Make sure you clean that
It's the only way to get the
Flavor

[Bridge]
After you finished me, I kiss you
And you lick your lips, and so do I
Know you never waste a drip
So don't you wonder how it feels
I do sometimes, must be good to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me coming, keep me going
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning
Don't stop loving 'til the morning, don't stop loving 'til the morning
Don't stop screaming, freaking, blowing

[Chorus]
Can you eat my skittles?
It's the sweetest in the middle (Yeah)
Pink is the flavor
Solve the riddle (Yeah)
I'ma lean back
Don't worry, it's nothing major
Make sure you clean that
It's the only way to get the
Flavor

[Chorus]
Don't be denied, don't be denied
Don't be denied, don't be denied
Don't be denied, don't be denied

[Verse 1]
When I was a young boy
My mama said to me
Your daddy's leaving home today
I think he's gone to stay
We packed up all our bags
And drove out to Winnipeg

When we got to Winnipeg
I checked in to school
I wore white bucks on my feet
When I learned the golden rule
The punchеs came fast and hard
Lyin' on my back in the school yard

[Chorus]
Don't be dеnied, don't be denied
Don't be denied, don't be denied
Don't be denied, don't be denied

[Verse 2]
Well pretty soon I met a friend
He played guitar
We used to sit on the steps at school
And dream of being stars
We started a band
We played all night

[Chorus]
Oh no
Don't be denied, don't be denied
Don't be denied, don't be denied
Don't be denied, no no, don't be denied

[Verse 3]
The businessmen crowded around
They came to hear the golden sound
There we were on the Sunset Strip
Playing our songs for the highest bid
We played all night
The price was right

[Chorus]
Don't be denied, don't be denied, no no
Don't be denied, don't be denied
Don't be denied, no no, don't be denied

[Verse 4]
Well, all that glitters isn't gold
I guess you heard the story told
But I'm a pauper in a naked disguise
A millionaire through a business man's eyes
Oh friend of mine

[Chorus]
Don't be denied, don't be denied
Don't be denied, don't be denied
Don't be denied, no no, don't be denied

[Verse 3]
The businessmen crowded around
They came to hear the golden sound
There we were on the Sunset Strip
Playing our songs for the highest bid
We played all night
The price was right

[Chorus]
Don't be denied, don't be denied, no no
Don't be denied, don't be denied
Don't be denied, no no, don't be denied

[Intro]
Haha!
I'm off the henn'
I'm better off alone, 'lone
'Lone, 'lone, 'lone
Haha!
Look

[Chorus]
It's 3 A.M., I'm in my bed I'm off the henn' and all alone
Going through some shit, I realize now I need you the most
Still fuck these hoes, but I can't lie, none of them come close
The feeling that you give, whenever it's you holding me close
I know I said I won't fall for none of these bitches, but I did
I know I got my flaws, but you accept it all for what it is (Oh woah, oh)
It's hard for me to love, it's hard for me to tell you what it is (Okay)
It's hard for me to trust, it's hard for me to even let you in (Oh, oh, oh)

[Open Verse]

[Chorus]
It's 3 A.M., I'm in my bed I'm off the henn' and all alone
Going through some shit, I realize now I need you the most
Still fuck these hoes, but I can't lie, none of them come close
The feeling that you give, whenever it's you holding me close
I know I said I won't fall for none of these bitches, but I did
I know I got my flaws, but you accept it all for what it is (Oh woah, oh)
It's hard for me to love, it's hard for me to tell you what it is (Okay)
It's hard for me to trust, it's hard for me to even let you in (Oh, oh, oh)
Where the dust settles in, I'm boring again
Where the dust settles in, the orange begins
When the gong and the long day come to an end
The dust settles in

Dream away
Dance into the day
Golden rays
Turning into grey
Dream away
Dance into the day
Dance and decay

I see my future is bright
Just wanna see the sunlight
I hold my peace and watch the day go by
With all my friends by my side
Got them along for the ride
When thе dust settles in

Dream away into thе sun
Stream of a sunray dance and flow
Golden at first and then grey at the most
Crackle of fire and sun in my toes
Oh, the dust settles home

[Verse 1]
If could know what you're thinking
If could know what you're thinking
Tell me it's real, what you're singing
Tell me I'm good, I'm forgiven
I feel like you're cold, and you're distant
Whenever we talk, you're consistent
If I could know
If I could know

[Chorus]
What you're thinking
What you're think, thinking
What you're thinking
What you're think, thinking
What you're thinking
What you're think, thinking
What you're thinking
What you're think, thinking

[Verse 2]
I'm overdoing it now
It used to come so easily but now I think you've broken me
I've got my head in a cloud
Remembering the warmer days we spent
If could know what you're thinking
I could learn to do everything right
Wish I could know how to fix it
But that's just not the way I live my life

[Chorus]
What you're thinking
What you're think, thinking
What you're thinking
What you're think, thinking
What you're thinking
What you're think, thinking
What you're thinking
What you're think, thinking
Thinking, thinking, think, think, thinking
Thinking, thinking, think, think, thinking

[Outro]
When you're with me
I just breathe so quickly
The sky is low and things are changing
Can you help me figure out my feelings?
'Cause clarity is not in love with me
Not in love with me
Not in love with me
Oh, we're not in love
Can you help me figure out my feelings?
We're not in love

[Vocalising]

[Verse]
Race me down to the water
Wish you'd see the world how I do
Don't ask me where I came from, I'm a daughter
Of the moon
And can do with my body
Whatever wanna do
I belong to no one but myself
So I'll do what do

[Vocalising]

[Verse]
Misery moon
You knew I was a fool
There was magic on the planet when you came to
Misery's mine
Smelling of wine
Today, and every day oh my

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
You're speaking your name to me
You know I can't hear a thing
My eyes are like cloudy mountains
Lately I've been living in space
And the stars have been dazzling
Oh, the stars have been dazzling

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
The fog was getting to me
Oh, the fog was getting to me
There's a storm in your breath
And a thorn in your chest
Planting baby's breath
Oh, I glow, I glow when I'm alone
You go, and I glow, oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I'm packing up, will you find me when I'm done?
I can't sit still when you're here
I know I'll forget you when you go
I know I'll forget you when you go
So say something I'll remember tomorrow
So say something
Say something I'll remember tomorrow

[Verse]
Like a moth to a flame
I'll pull you in, I pulled you back to
What you need initially
It's just one call away
And you'll leave him, you're loyal to me
But this time, I let you be

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause he seems like he's good for you
And he makes you feel like you should
And all your friends say he's the one
His love for you is true

[Chorus]
But does he know you call me when he sleeps?
But does he know the pictures that you keep?
But does he know the reasons that you cry?
Or tell me, does he know where your heart lies?
Where it truly lies

[Post-Chorus]
Where it truly lies
Right here with me, babe
Where it truly lies
My bed, babe
Where it truly lies
In my arms, babe
Where it truly lies
Woah, oh
Where it truly lies

[Chorus]
But does he know you call me when he sleeps? (No)
But does he know the pictures that you keep? (Oh)
But does he know the reasons that you cry?
Or tell me, does he know where your heart lies?
Where it truly lies

[Post-Chorus]
Right here with me, babe
Where it truly lies
My bed, babe
Where it truly lies
In my arms, babe
Where it truly lies
Woah, oh
Where it truly lies

[Outro]
Where it truly lies
Right here with me, babe
Where it truly lies
My bed, babe
Where it truly lies
In my arms, babe
Where it truly lies
Woah, oh
See everday im on the block man
9 millimeter on the waist and the walkman
Your boy can't stop talking
Tried to leave the life and came back again
Trying to make a lil change but
Trouble seems to follow me everywhere i go man
Find myself doing the same things
If i dont change i'll be right back again

[Verse 1]
A lazy rain am I, the skies refuse to cry
Cremation takes its piece of your supply
The night is dressed like noon, a sailor spoke too soon
And China's on the dark side of the moon (Hit me now)

[Verse 2]
Platypus are a few, the secret life of Roo
A personality I never knew (Get it on)
My Greta weighs a ton, the archers on the run
And no one stands alone behind the sun

[Chorus]
It's been a long time since I made a new friend
Waitin' on anothеr black summer to end
It's been a long time and you nеver know when
Waitin' on another black summer to end

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Crack the flaming whip, a-sailin' on a censorship
Riding on a headless horse to make the trip

[Chorus]
Been a long time since I made a new friend
Waitin' on another black summer to end
It's been a long time and you never know when
Waitin' on another black summer to end

[Outro]
I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
Waitin' on another black summer to end
I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
Waitin' on another black summer to end
I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
Waitin' on another black summer to end
Maybe I'm a dreamer, maybe I'm a fool
Lately I can hardly see the sun
If you hide a secret I could take a guess
Nothing in your eyes seems to hold on me

Truth or consequences, which one will it be?

Someone said that time would ease the pain
Of two lives love has grown apart
But I believe whoever wrote that song
Never had a broken heart

One of us is hiding, one of us can tell
'Cause no one likes to be the first to know
Someone has to answer 'cause someone has to ask
Keeping on like this is torture

And going undecided is twice as bad for sure

Someone said that time would ease the pain
Of two lives love has grown apart
But I believe whoever wrote that song
Never had a broken heart
Someone said that time would ease the pain
Of two lives love has grown apart
But I believe whoever wrote that song
Never had a broken heart

[Verse]
Come and see you tonight
Come and see you tonight
Come and see the cars and the tungsten lights
We'll go in fast and bitter
And leave those doubts that they know nothing about
Come and see you tonight
Come and see you tonight
Come and see the stars and their racing stripes
Among the glass and glitter
You'll sing a song that you know nothing about

[Bridge]
Oh
Oh, nothing about
Nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin'

[Chorus]
This light'll keep me going
This light'll keep me going
And I don't even know wherever I may go
This light'll keep me going
This light'll keep me going
And I don't even know wherever I may go
This light'll keep me going
This light'll keep me going
And I don't even know wherever I may go
This light'll keep me going
This light'll keep mе going
And I don't even know wherеver I may go
This light'll keep me going
This light'll keep me going
And I don't even know wherever I may go
This light'll keep me going
This light'll keep me going
And I don't even know wherever I may go

[Chorus]
Is it real?
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Is it real?
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 1]
Is it real? I wanna go back
Times have all changed and I don't want that
'Cause I feel our lives roll past
Look the wrong way when I'm moving too fast

[Chorus]
There, you see me go out the picture
There, you see me go out the door
There, you see me go out the picture
There, you see me go out the door
There, you see me go out the picture
There, you see me go out the door
There, you see me go out the picture
Thеre, you see me go out the door
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Is it rеal?
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 2]
Is it real? Wind the tape back
Watch the whole reel 'til the picture goes black
Dig your heels, feel the roots crack
Rings in your center, but I wouldn't count that
Rings in your center, but I wouldn't count that

[Chorus]
There, you see me go out the picture
There, you see me go out the door
There, you see me go out the picture
There, you see me go out the door
There, you see me go out the picture
There, you see me go out the door
There, you see me go out the picture
There, you see me go out the door

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 1]
I drink Dr. Pepper, and I'm proud
I used to be alone in a crowd
But now you look around these days
There seems to be a Dr. Pepper craze

[Chorus]
I'm a Pepper in the sunshine
I'm a Pepper in the moonlight
I'm a Pepper in the good times
Doctor Pepper

[Bridge]
(Sunshine)
I'm a pepper
(Moonlight)
You're a pepper
(Good times)
Drink Dr. Pepper

[Verse 2]
Everywhere you go are pepper
Lots of folks you know a peppers
Wouldn't you like to be a pepper too?
I'm a Pepper, he's a Pepper
And if you drink Dr. Pepper
You will find that you're a Pepper too

[Outro]
(Drink Dr. Pepper) Drink Dr. Pepper
(Be a Pepper) Be a Pepper
(Drink Dr. Pepper)
David Bowie
Andy Warhol. (45 second intro mistakenly left on Bowie's cut)

[Verse 1]
Like to take a cement fix
Be a standing cinema
Dress my friends up just for show
See them as they really are
Put a peephole in my brain
Two new pence to have a go
Like to be a gallery
Put you all inside my show

[Chorus]
Andy Warhol, looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, silver screen
Can't tell them apart at all

[Verse 2]
Andy walking, Andy tired
Andy take a little snooze
Tie him up when he fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise
Andy wakes up on the sea
Be sure to think of me and you
To think and paint, to think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do

[Chorus]
Andy Warhol, looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, silver screen
Can't tell them apart at all

[Vocal Break]

[Chorus]
Andy Warhol, looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, silver screen
Can't tell them apart at all

[Verse 1]
I've given you all my love
Given you all of me
Will my bleeding soul
Make you ache
Let me see what you have
Let me fire up the sheets
Wake up the beast inside
Make you ache

[Chorus]
I'll make it sweet and go down all below
(All the way to Calico)
I'll make it sweet and go down all below
(Ooh, show you all the moves I know)
I'll make it sweet and go down all below
(All the way to Calico)
Am I going down below, all the way to Calico?
Come on

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Ooh, how do you like me now?
How do you like the heat?
Taking to New York
Make you ache
Taking off into space
Taking off all the shame
Feeling your body raise
Make you ache

[Chorus]
I'll make it sweet and go down all below
(All the way to Calico)
I'll make it sweet and go down all below
(Ooh, show you all the moves I know)
I'll make it sweet and go down all below
(All the way to Calico)
Am I going down below, all the way to Calico?
Come on

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'll make it sweet and go down all below
(All the way to Calico)
I'll make it sweet and go down all below
(Ooh, show you all the moves I know)
I'll make it sweet and go down all below
(All the way to Calico)
Am I going down below, all the way to Calico?
Come on

[Instrumental Outro]
Sweet, oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
Sweet, oh, woah-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
In a matter of time, there'll be a friend of mine
Going to come to the coast
You're going to see him up close for a minute or two
While the ground cracks under you

By the look in your eyes
You'd think that it was a surprise
But you seem to forget
Something somebody said
About the bubbles in the sea
And an ocean full of trees
And you now

[Chorus]
L.A. uptight
City in the smog, city in the smog, city in the smog
Don't you wish that you could be here too?
Don't you wish that you could be here too?
Don't you wish that you could be here too?

[Verse 2]
Well, you get up to leavе 'cause it's hard to believе
And you laugh at the door that you heard it all before
And it's so good to know
That it's all just a show for you

But when the suppers are planned
And the freeways are crammed
And the mountains erupt
And the valley is sucked
Into cracks in the earth
Will we finally be heard by you

[Chorus]
L.A. uptight
City in the smog, city in the smog, city in the smog
Don't you wish that you could be here too?
Don't you wish that you could be here too?
Don't you wish that you could be here too?

[Verse 1]
Ever since I was a young girl
People tried to take a piece of me
Tried to fuck me with their money
Tryna tell me how we're all to be
But I thought it would be different
From the way your eyes held my gaze
But you hit me like a car crash, baby
So I had to leave, I couldn't stay

[Pre-Chorus]
I need to go
And pull myself together, yeah
Into my flow
And snap back like a rubber band
Now I know
My heart is out at the quicksand
And I'm climbing up the mountain
No, there ain't no doubt about it

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm back again
I told you that I would be
But I never said when
Yeah, I'm back again
I told you that I would be
But I never said when

[Verse 2]
Used to dream about my revenge
All the ways I would let them know
That they never really knew me
Or just a glimpse through a window
Then I looked into the mirror
And I couldn't even recognize
Who was the girl right there in front of me?
And what was that behind those eyes?

[Pre-Chorus]
I need to go
And pull myself together, yeah
Into my flow
And snap back like a rubber band
Now I know
My heart is out at the quicksand
And I'm climbing up the mountain
No, there ain't no doubt about it

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm back again
I told you that I would be
But I never said when
Yeah, I'm back again
I told you that I would be
But I never said when

[Bridge]
What is this feeling that I have in my heart?
I've never had it before
What is this feeling that I feel in my soul?
I never knew it at all
I knew I was down
They thought I was out
But now I'm back
Mmm, I'm back
Woah

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm back again
I told you that I would be
But I never said when
Yeah, I'm back again
I told you that I would be
But I never said when

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm back again (Yeah, yeah)
I told you that I would be
But I never said when (And I know)
Yeah, I'm back again (Yeah)
(Yeah, yeah) I told you that I would be
Yeah, I told you that I would be, ooh

[Verse 1]
Close your eyes, ease your mind
Let the intensity hit
Can't deny all the things you feel inside
Only human, I know you're hurting for it

[Pre-Chorus]
You're sleepless at night, yeah
I'm all in your head
The moment we met keeps repeating
Obsessing about me, the things that I said
I'm all that you're feeling
And you should know I feel the same

[Chorus]
Don't you hesitate, I can't wait
Give me just one touch, yeah
Send me up in flames, I can't wait
Give me just one touch, yeah

[Verse 2]
Might've liеd, I want it twice
Relax and easе into me, yeah
I promise I'll really get your body hot
Only human, let the intensity hit

[Pre-Chorus]
You're sleepless at night, yeah
I'm all in your head
The moment we met keeps repeating
Obsessing about me, the things that I said
I'm all that you're feeling
And you should know I feel the same

[Chorus]
Don't you hesitate, I can't wait
Give me just one touch, yeah
Send me up in flames, I can't wait
Give me just one touch, yeah
Don't you hesitate, I can't wait
Give me just one touch, yeah
Send me up in flames, I can't wait
Give me just one touch

[Bridge]
Just one touch, just one touch
Don't wait, give me just one touch
Just one touch, just one touch
Don't wait, give me just one
Just one touch, just one touch
Don't wait, give me just one touch
Just one touch, just one touch
Don't wait, give me just one

[Chorus]
Don't you hesitate, I can't wait
Give me just one touch, yeah
Send me up in flames, I can't wait
Give me just one touch
Don't you (Just one touch, just one touch)
Hesitate (Don't wait, give me just one touch)
I can't wait (Just one touch, just one touch)
Give me just one touch, yeah (Don't wait, give me just one)
Send me (Just one touch, just one touch)
Up in flames (Don't wait, give me just one touch)
I can't wait (Just one touch, just one touch)
Give me just one touch, yeah

[Verse 1]
Share my life, take me for what I am
'Cause I'll never change all my colors for you
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
Can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide

[Chorus]
But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you

[Verse 2]
You see through, right to the heart of me
You break down my walls with the strength of your love, mm
I never knew love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
I can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide
Your love, I'll remember forever

[Chorus]
But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me, no
Don't walk away from me

[Outro]
Don't you dare walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you
If I don't have you, oh you

[Verse 1]
I was brave and I love my cuz
She was wavin' that dope man up
Banged a mom ’cause I see no future
Sat her down when I poured that tea
I don't know 'cause I got big temper
Stick close to my rainbow side
Candy corn and that dancing leopard
That’s all, folks, that's all

[Chorus]
She's the kinda girl that'll make you wanna go faster now
She's the kinda girl that'll make you steal your child
She's the kinda girl, she's in her here ever after now
There’s a cry for help and I don’t deny

[Verse 2]
I don't know, but it’s finally just one more mile
Peaches are sold and all givin' up on that Humpty style
At the Caldwell 'cross from the blacktop
She's Eurasian, met her at the Quick Stop
We danced at Tito’s Go Go
Girlfriend's back, now she's gone solo

[Chorus]
She's the kinda girl that'll make you wanna go faster now
She's the kinda girl that'll make you steal your child
She's the kinda girl, she's in her here ever after now
There's a cry for help and I don't deny

[Verse 3]
Wet my beak and I give it up to that drugstore nose
So unique and I live it up 'til that liquor store close
In the laundry, queen ballistic
Mangy face with the messed up lipstick
My thing is blacked out loco
Smoke and tears, now take my photo, 'cause

[Chorus]
She's the kinda girl that'll make you wanna go faster now
She's the kinda girl that'll make you steal your child
She's the kinda girl, she's in her here ever after now
There's a cry for help and I don't deny
I don't deny

[Bridge]
Bangin' hard with those daddy issues
Hanging out with that Chevron dude
Knocked her out, so I let her kiss you
Redneck fights, ah, Hercules bit you
Big box, hoppin' on detox
Fast food trash when you're livin' in the crosswalk
Catch me out like motel hoes do
Blood on fries, now that's my go-to

[Chorus]
She's the kinda girl who makes you wanna go faster now
She's the kinda girl that'll make you steal your child
She's the kinda girl, she's in her here ever after now
There's a cry for help and I don't deny
I don't deny

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
I'm not the person that you thought I was
I'm not the one you thought you knew
I'd do most anything to make you think that I'm the one
I'd do it all to get to you

[Verse 2]
You see me as the perfect compliment
You think that I'm someone to choose
You see me in a way that makes me want to reinvent
A person I could turn into

[Chorus]
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I wanna come
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I wanna run
Blue strides are callin' and I can't stop fallin'
Give me the lovе and I'll tell you when I wanna run

[Verse 3]
I don't look like mysеlf in photographs
Long days of time have been unkind
I miss the you, the one that makes me want to redefine
I'm not the one you fell into
I'm not the one, the one for you

[Chorus]
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I wanna come
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I wanna run
Blue strides are callin' and I can't stop fallin'
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I wanna run

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I'll wanna come
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I'll wanna run
Blue strides are calling and I can't stop fallin'
Give me the love and I'll tell you when I'll wanna run

[Verse 1]
Melle Mel and Richard Hell were dancing at the Taco Bell
When someone heard a Rebel Yell, I think it was an infidel
Adam Ant and Robert Plant, the banter of a sycophant
Enlisted by Ulysses Grant to record at the Record Plant
Islamabad is on the nod, Havana and the riot squad
And if you want to be a Mod, you'll have to meet me at the quad

[Refrain]
You got the best of my loco
I'll take the rest of your showboat
You got the best of my Yoko
I'll take the rest of your low note

[Verse 2]
Parliament's Atomic Dog, thе hats were filling up with fog
Talk about the lifе and death of every penny analogue
The seventies were such a win, singing the Led Zeppelin
Lizzy looking mighty Thin, the Thomson's had another Twin
My daughter won the lottery, the numbers never thought of me
Ramones had a lobotomy, so spin me like your pottery

[Chorus]
I will be your poster child
You know, the world is ours for a little while
And then, I will be your poster child tonight, ow
La-da-da-da, ba-ba-ba-dum

[Verse 3]
A funky feast of Sandinista, Neon mono Mona Lisa
Judas Priest the sweet barista, mother load was named Teresa
Bubble gum I cum Bazooka, Dirty Dan, Dean and Deluca
Smoked banana in your hookah, now I know the brand is RVCA
Bernie Mac and Caddy Shack were dusty as the brickerbrac
And if you ask me for the time I'll tell you that The Future's Back

[Refrain]
You got the best of my loco
I'll take the rest of your showboat
You got the best of my Yoko
I'll take the rest of your low note

[Verse 4]
Steve Miller and Duran Duran, a joker dancing in the sand
Van Morrison the astral man, a festival they have in Cannes
Speak of Chico and the Man, the silence of a certain lamb
MC5 kick out the jam, a poncho full of contraband
Dairy Queen was on the scene, the EveryKid teen magazine
The Motorhead and Mr. Clean, my piston needed Valvoline

[Chorus]
I will be your poster child
You know, the world is ours for a little while
And then I will be your poster child tonight
La-da-da-da, ba-ba-ba-dum

[Bridge]
You got me on this
Well, and I can't get off
With no one else but you
You turn me on, too
Well, and I can't get up (Ooh)
For no one else but you

[Verse 5]
Cream Magazine a Love Supreme, the ballad of a Billie Jean
And now we know the Status Quo, but God will never Save the Queen
Dave Mushegain Copenhagen, cowboy ghost of Ronald Reagan
Dollar save was Flavor-Flavin', Cosmic rays of Carl Sagan
Hammer fist a double kiss unlisted number purple mist
The Chubby Checker do the twist, and everyone's a narcissist

[Refrain]
You got the best of my loco
I'll take the rest of your showboat
You got the best of my Yoko
I'll take the rest of your low note

[Verse 6]
The waterbed was taking meds, Devo with their hats of red
A fatty for the Natty Dread, a pocket full of Talking Heads
Maya's making Paper Planes, addiction to the days of Janes
My Slurpee's made of Purple Rain, ten fingers in the lion's mane
Giant squid karate kid, Sid Vicious and the katydid
The planet that we must forbid, The English Beat are in Madrid

[Chorus]
I will be your poster child
You know the world is ours for a little while
And then I will be your poster child tonight
La-da-da-da, ba-ba-ba-dum
I will be your poster child
You know the world is ours for a little while
And then I will be your poster child tonight
La-da-da-da, ba-ba-ba-dum

[Verse 1]
She's a box car rollin' by
Like a black star in the sky
She's a failure once or twice
Like a trailer spinnin' out upon dizzy ice

[Pre-Chorus]
Flowers fly when we grow old
Snakes get high, or so I'm told
She's an eagle out on the road
Like my favorite Beatle everyone bought and sold

[Chorus]
All of my love and half my kisses
Superstar don't do the dishes
I just want the great apes to be free
Come on now, you lazy cowboy
Heads or tails, but not right now, boy
I just want the great apes to be free

[Verse 2]
She's a rain bird on the prowl
Like an urge to be yourself that you won't allow
She's a forest that we burned
Just a blueprint for a life that we had never learned

[Pre-Chorus]
Flowers fly when we grow old
Snakes get high, or so I'm told
She's a lynch mob on the street
Take another step and I will kill the beat

[Chorus]
All of my love and half my kisses
Superstar don't do the dishes
I just want the great apes to be free
Come on now, you lazy cowboy
Heads or tails, but not right now, boy
I just want the great apes to be free

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
She's a bus stop, glockenspiel
She's a simulation life that you thought was real
She's an image that we blurred
It's a pixelated panther, now let it purr

[Chorus]
All of my love and half my kisses
Superstar don't do the dishes
I just want the great apes to be free
Come on now, you lazy cowboy
Heads or tails, but not right now, boy
I just want the great apes to be free

[Outro]
I just want the great apes to be free
I just want the great apes to be free

[Verse 1]
She was a London girl
Knew enough how to get herself alright
He was a Southend boy
Not enough smile, but he sure could fight
She was a daddy's girl
Pride of all Brixton with dragon sight

[Pre-Chorus]
But she can't go home tonight

[Chorus]
It's only natural
And lover will show you how
To break it down
In spite of attraction, well
It's only natural
And people will show you how
To take it down
In spite of your love, steady up

[Verse 2]
They were a perfect pair
A clash of two beauties and a rash of fame
Nobody knows just when
Lightning will strike but it always came

[Pre-Chorus]
And she can't go home tonight
No, she can't go home tonight

[Chorus]
It's only natural
And lover will show you how
To break it down
In spite of attraction, well
It's only natural
And people will show you how
To take it down
In spite of your love, steady up

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
But she can't go home tonight

[Chorus]
It's only natural
And lover will show you how
To break it down
In spite of attraction, well
It's only natural
And people will show you how
To take it down
In spite of your love
It's only natural
And lover will show you how
To break it down
The perfect subtraction, well
It's only natural
And people will show you how
To take it down
In spite of your love, steady up

[Intro]
(The, the, the, the, the, the)

[Verse 1]
The flower's pink on the tree
But if you pick it to see
Will it be wild and free?
You say you wanted a piece
Is it for sale or for lease?
Oh, that's the easy police
(Come on down)
Outside the world within ya
Bend to the Woolf Virginia
Take to the bridge that's under
Hunt for the sun to wonder
Whatcha wanna do today?
I'm your favorite kid, let's play
Dedicated to the ones we serve
She's so full of learning curves
I, oh, I

[Pre-Chorus]
Shе's a lover
She's a lover
Shе's a lover
She's a lover

[Chorus]
Love me, love me
Wake up and hug me
I will be a torrid beast
Well, if you need me, need me
Wake up and squeeze me
Nothin' but a sweet relief
I, oh, I

[Verse 2]
And when I'm fallin' asleep
Please give me somethin' to keep
Me warm and kind of complete
Long time to go without ya
Try slow to know about ya
For now is my better
Less time in forever
Please, love, can I have a taste?
I just wanna lick your face
Any other day and I would say
You're Atlantis manta ray

[Pre-Chorus]
She's a lover
She's a lover
She's a lover
She's a lover
She's a lover, unlimited love again
Gotta love her, unlimited love again
She's a lover, unlimited love again
Little lover, unlimited love again

[Chorus]
Love me, love me
Wake up and hug me
I will be a torrid beast
Well, if you need me, need me
Wake up and squeeze me
Nothin' but a sweet relief

[Bridge]
Look at you

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Love me, love me
Wake up and hug me
I will be a torrid beast
Well, if you need me, need me
Wake up and squeeze me
Nothin' but a sweet relief

[Outro]
Nothin' but a sweet relief
I will be a torrid beast
I will be a torrid beast
I will be a torrid beast

[Verse 1]
Make me a fist
Purple Mountain road that I can't miss
Have we all had enough?
Have we all had too much?

[Verse 2]
Lost in a dream
Please step down from your bully machine
Can we all back it up?
Can we all give it up?

[Chorus]
These are the ways when you come from America
The sights, the sounds, the smells
These are the ways when you come from America
I don't want to die and she's gonna take good care of ya
I just want to thrive and there's gonna be hystеria

[Post-Chorus]
Don't be late
Walk us through the goldеn gate, yeah!
Bruce and George
Singing for their own reward

[Verse 3]
Take me inside
Twenty-three windows and it's gonna be a long ride
All had enough?
Have we all had too much?

[Verse 4]
Sing me the blues
Cowgirl's tight in her basketball shoes
Can we all back it up?
Can we all give it up?

[Chorus]
These are the ways when you come from America
The sights, the sounds, the smells
These are the ways when you come from America
I don't want to die and she's gonna take good care of ya
I just want to thrive and there's gonna be hysteria

[Post-Chorus]
Don't be late
Walk us through the golden gate, yeah!
Bruce and George
Singing for their own reward

[Verse 1]
I got no reason to believe
Just a theory that we do appease
I don't know what you want from me
Where you go to get your ecstasy
Start tapping rhythm from the source
Maybe I could be your Crazy Horse

[Pre-Chorus]
We only wanted to be
We only wanted to be sure
What is it for?
Come get me
We only wanted to be
We only wanted to be

[Chorus]
What you thinkin’?
Got more than enough for you, yeah
Over and over and over again, well
Over and over until it sends
What you thinkin'?
White buffalo be drinkin' dirty
Over and over and over again, well
Over and over with all my friends

[Verse 2]
I think the two of us should go
For a drive like maybe Idaho
Road trip circuits just around the bend
I could be your beneficial friend
Call me every name in the book
Punk-ass fascist and a dirty crook

[Pre-Chorus]
We only wanted to be
We only wanted to be sure
What is it for?
Come get me
We only wanted to be
We only wanted to be

[Chorus]
What you thinkin’?
Got more than enough for you, yeah
Over and over and over again, well
Over and over until it sends
What you thinkin'?
White buffalo be drinkin' dirty
Over and over and over again now
Over and over with all my friends

[Bridge]
I got these things in mind, you know
South Dakota, show the buffalo
In the Black Hills you could find it all
Blood runs thick like from a waterfall
This broken native entity
Dreaming clean-up on the century
This horse is crazy not to be
This horse is crazy

[Chorus]
What you thinkin'?
Got more than enough for you, well
Over and over and over again, yeah
Over and over until it sends
What you thinkin'?
White buffalo be drinkin' dirty
Over and over and over again now
Over and over with all my friends

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
Anything at all
Anything and I will find you
Anything at all
Can I be your first brawl?

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyone that's there is someone
Everyone that's here is someone
Everyone, I swear, is someone's daughter

[Chorus]
And it feels so good upon a Saturday night
When the bastards come to fight
And it won't be long before they carry me home
I'm the bastard of your light

[Verse 2]
When it's said and done
Meet me at the old meat market
When it's said and done
Can I please make you come?

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyonе that goes is someone
Evеryone that throws is someone
Everyone that knows it's in the water

[Chorus]
And it feels so good upon a Saturday night
When the bastards come to fight
And it won't be long before they carry me home
I'm the bastard of your light
And it feels so fine to know my shattering bones
When it's all those lefts and rights
And it won't be long before I'm buried alone
I'm the bastard of your light

[Bridge]
I'll decorate your face
It's time to get it on
How does that crimson taste?
What, what, what, what?
It's time to bob and weave
Ya gotta move your feet
It's an honor to receive
Tomato cans on tap
Another dandy chap
How 'bout a canvas nap?
One, two, three, four

[Chorus]
And it feels so good upon a Saturday night
When the bastards come to fight
And it won't be long before they carry me home
I'm the bastard of your light
And it feels so good upon a Saturday night
When the bastards come to fight
And it won't be long before they carry me home
I'm the bastard of your light

[Verse 1]
I'm a tangled tiger and I want to rip it all to shreds
So I can ask it why
She's a loaded cobra and she wanted to be with me
For the ride
In a Sunday diner, I'm reminded there's no finer place to kiss
Than one like this

[Chorus]
But babe, I can see what's right with you
White braids and pillow chair
I could spend my nights with you
This pussy willow
Babe, I can see all sides of you
White braids and pillow chair
I don't know what I would do
Without your pillow

[Verse 2]
She's a Bobby Darin singing to the fish and herring sacrifice
Oh, that's her knife
There's a Karmann Ghiah parked out back and we believe it is alive (Oh)
You can see the river runnin' through my dеvastated concrete еyes
They don't deny

[Chorus]
But babe, I can see what's right with you
White braids and pillow chair
I could spend my nights with you
This pussy willow
Babe, I can see all sides of you
White braids and pillow chair
I don't know what I would do

[Outro]
California blue
Sing to you, things to do
California blue
Sing to you
Deep Ventura sky
Rolling by, rolling why
Deep Ventura sky
Rolling by
Santa Cruz in June
Either blue, surf the moon
Santa Cruz in June
Surf the moon
San Francisco Bay
Safe to say, paved the way
San Francisco Bay
Paved the way

[Verse 1]
Come from the sun in San Marino
Guess that makes me Angeleno
Friends got married, had them dogs
Now they read those catalogs
This commerce makes me nauseous (Ah)
When did life get so damn cautious?
So I drive in search of smiles
XM on, let's check out Miles

[Pre-Chorus]
This slice of life when you're out on the road
Is always extra nice when there's someone to hold

[Chorus]
Ay-oh, way-oh
Would you be my traffic jam?
Ay-oh, way-oh
Spirographic anagram
Ay-oh, way-oh
Would you be my traffic jam?
Ay-oh, way-oh
Would you be mine?

[Verse 2]
Anyway, I was headed south
Taste of coffee in my mouth
Up that off-ramp 405
Angry drivers on both sides
Got a call from my good friend Dave
He said, "Yo, let's get that wave"
I said, "Yes, just tell me where"
Board's up top, wind in my hair
From the mind of Frida Kahlo
Show me love and I will follow
From the words of my old man (Old man)
Conversations in the sand

[Pre-Chorus]
This slice of life when you're out on the road
Is always extra nice when there's someone to hold

[Chorus]
Ay-oh, way-oh
Would you be my traffic jam?
Ay-oh, way-oh
Spirographic anagram
Ay-oh, way-oh
Would you be my traffic jam?
Ay-oh, way-oh
Would you be mine?

[Bridge]
I got a slice of life that's built for you
Oh, now, come and give me something to spread my bread onto (Onto)
T-t-t, t-t-t, time and time again, we get a window and a clue
Time and time again, life-changing rendezvous

[Verse 3]
Anyway, made a left on third
Got distracted, jumped that curb
Unaware and on her walk
I hit the brakes, made time to talk
She said, "Can I get that ride?"
Oh my God, just get inside
It was all that I imagined
Born to ride, enthusiasm
Packed our bags and headed west
PCH, I'm so impressed
My friends said, "Havin' fun yet?"
We drove off into the sunset

[Pre-Chorus]
This slice of life when you're out on the road
Is always extra nice when there's someone to hold

[Chorus]
Ay-oh, way-oh
Would you be my traffic jam?
Ay-oh, way-oh
Spirographic anagram
Ay-oh, way-oh
Would you be my traffic jam?
Ay-oh, way-oh
Would you be mine?

[Outro]
Would you be mine?
Would you be mine?
Would you be mine?
Would you be mine? (Be mine, woah)

[Bass Solo]

[Verse 1]
My name is Veronica
I come from the South Side of Chicago
Remember my raincoat
We love you the same way, and
My life is a rope swing
Always headin' back to from where I came
Got no need to blame you

[Chorus]
Danger, danger
Everyone goes for a ride
Danger, danger
Everyone loses their mind

[Verse 2]
My name is Nebraska
I live in a matchbox of Omaha
It's nothin' fantastic
We love you the same way, and
You call me Maria
My life on the north side of Miami
I might comе and see ya

[Chorus]
Danger, danger
Everyonе goes for a ride (Let's go for a ride now)
Danger, danger (Everyone)
Everyone loses their mind (Okay)

[Verse 3]
My name is "I love you"
I come from the same place as everyone
Just lucky to be here
We love you the same way, and
This heart is relentless
I love you the most when you're down and out
Please come to my senses
'Cause we all play the same game

[Chorus]
Danger, danger
Everyone goes for a ride (Here we go, my friends)
Danger (Everyone), danger (Everyone)
Everyone loses their mind

[Bridge]
Been a long time now
Been a long time now
Been a long time since I took you, my toll
Been a long time now
Been a long time now
Been a long time since I took you, my soul
I don't want it to be broken up
I don't want it to be without love

[Outro]
This is the end
My passionate friend
My passionate friend
I send my love from, now
This is the end
My passionate friend
My passionate friend
Ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I don't want it to be broken up)
Been a long time now
Been a long time now
Been a long time since I took you, my soul
(I don't want it to be without love)
Been a long time now
Been a long time now
Been a long time now
Been a long time, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Cry, cry, let 'em cry
We don't need no reason why
I'ma touch you up with every
Lovin', rough emotion
Cry, cry, let 'em cry
Bleeding from my restless eye
Our laws are breaking
And no physics can define us

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell my wife and dog
I'll be home at 3 a.m.​
To kiss you in the mornin'
Cry, cry, let 'em cry
Know what I have deep inside
It's time to break free
From the mouse trap when it's storming

[Chorus]
Up, up the lover, we got the mother
Touch up the neighbor, she don't mind
Up, up the fauna, we got Nirvana
All I know is I feel fine
Up, up anothеr, we got the cover
Touch up thе Raiders, they don't mind
Up, up the fauna, we got Madonna
All I know is I feel fine

[Verse 2]
Shine, shine, let 'em shine
Hit me with that lion's prize
Ten thousand heavens are
About to shed their glory
Shine, shine, let 'em shine
Hit me with that Guggenheim
I'ma tell you everything
And how to build a story

[Pre-Chorus]
Trust in love, my man
You can feel it raining down
So early when it's forming
Slide, slide, let it slide
My street is preoccupied
I'd like to kiss her face
If I could only find her

[Chorus]
Up, up the lover, we got the mother
Touch up the neighbor, she don't mind
Up, up the fauna, we got Nirvana
All I know is I feel fine
Up, up another, we got the cover
Touch up the Raiders, they don't mind
Up, up the fauna, we got Madonna
All I know is I feel fine

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Cry, cry, let 'em cry
We don't need no reason why
I'ma touch you up with every
Lovin', rough emotion
Cry, cry, let 'em cry
Bleeding from my lefty eye
Our laws are breaking
And no physics can define us

[Chorus]
Up, up the lover, we got the mother
Touch up the neighbor, she don't mind
Up, up the fauna, we got Nirvana
All I know is I feel fine
Up, up another, we got the cover
Touch up the Raiders, they don't mind
Up, up the fauna, we got Madonna
All I know is I feel fine

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Golden light
Streamin' from your eyes
Give me a piece of the real thing
And I live with you this life
Stripped and clean
A restless wolverine
An eloquent part of the whole dance
And I stray

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, with John Frusciante]
Tell the whole world to slow down
We gotta get off and we gotta go 'round
Tell the whole world to roll down
The window is broken, forever unspoken
Only whenever

[Chorus: John Frusciante]
Oh, I know that it's only gold
And I come slow now for evеrything
The heavy wing
Oh, I know that it's only gold
And I bleed into your pleasantriеs
The memory
Chemistry

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Death to rise
Subtraction of advice
The criminal ties of my rival
And I'll roll these dice
Cold supply
Scraping to get by
Blatantly flooding the low rise
And I'll throw this knife

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, with John Frusciante]
Trace me now through your innocence
Tell me it's part of the program I started
Space me now through your citizens
Tell me it's part of the whole plan now
Bringing my slow hand

[Chorus: John Frusciante]
Oh, I know that it's only gold
And I come slow now for everything
The heavy wing
Oh, I know that it's only gold
And I bleed into your pleasantries
The memory
The chemistry

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: John Frusciante]
Oh, I know that it's only gold
And I come slow now for everything
The heavy wing
Oh, I know that it's only gold
And I bleed into your pleasantries
The memory
Chemistry

[Verse 1]
When I'm with you, I feel like myself
No stranger, the shadow of somebody else
When I feel you holdin' my hand
I get touched, ain't this life grand?

[Chorus]
But the form of a life is long, never-ending
And the smell of your hello, I know
And the smile of a knife is seldom befriending
And the smell of tangelo, I know

[Verse 2]
When I'm near you, I feel like a king
A life force inside to do anything
When I'm downtown, I pick up the phone
I hear you and I'm not alone

[Chorus]
But the form of a life, a long never-ending
And the smell of your hello, I know
And the smile of a knife is seldom befriending
And the smell of tangelo, I know

[Bridge]
But December came strong, the mending went wrong
And the clothes on the line never dried
And the crows on my hill came in for the kill
But the dream of this love never died

[Verse 3]
When I lost you out in that field
My crooked eyes could hardly conceal
Tell me one time and bring me my tray
Oh, let it go and now I must pray
Let's pray

[Intro]
Let me take you there (let me)
Let me take you there
Come on baby, let me take you there (let me take you there)
You and me everywhere

Come into my world, baby
A world that's filled with fantasy
Unlock the door, I hold the key
Let's go and be free baby, you and me

[Chorus]
Hold on tight, let me take you there (let make take you there)
Stay with me, I'll show you that I can
Come on baby, let me take you there (take you there)

Forever, just hold onto me don't let go

[Chorus]

Stay with me, I'll show you that I can
Come on baby, let me take you there (take you there)
You and me everywhere

[Bridge 1]
Hold tight, your eyes won't believe
As we walk into the place of ecstasy, oh yeah
You know I want you and you know you want me
In time you'll see, it's our destiny
(Let me take you there, baby)
(Just let me, just let me...)

[Bridge 2]
Oh, let me hold you, just let me console you
Let me lead you into my world

So boy, let me take you there

[Chorus]

[Intro]
I want you to love me forever
I want you to love me forever
I want you to love me forever

[Verse 1]
She let me ride it like a caravan baby
I swear I need you to come lay right there with me
She say she down and she gon' lay and care for me
I don't know why she like the air that I'm breathing in
Baby, breathe in with me
You make me go brazy, I know you won't judge me
You might turn to wifey, give you wife things and babies

[Chorus]
I want you to love me forever
Baby you know that I came here for your destiny
She wanna drop it if she can, if she can baby
She wanna rock it with her hand, yeah a marriage

[Bridge]
She want it heavy like a bear
I told her drop that shit right here
I cut that pussy, barber chair
Then I'm goin' psh off in the air

[Verse 2]
Shine it up then bounce it, climbing in it just like a mountain
My bankroll big like a bouncer, spitting game like a counselor
Big old cross like a pastor, pop that pussy like a Snapple
Bitch I'm bleeding, where the napkins?
Body red like an apple
Screaming free my brothers, I still sleep with my mother
Last week I made a quarter, plus I still respect others
I can't believe it's not butter, that little bitch might be my supper
I get respect from her brother, Crenshaw boolin', Nipsey Hussle
Still prepared for them arrest, YSL we gon' wrestle
Chanel pouch on my left, fuck the cops we don't play
Benjamins, Grants talk back, I be like "who is that?"
They be like "where you at?", meet at the Valet at Saks

[Chorus]
I want you to love me forever
Baby you know that I came here for your destiny
She wanna drop it if she can, if she can baby
She wanna rock it with her hand, yeah a marriage

[Interlude]
I want you to love me forever
I want you to love me forever
Until we meet each other, oh
I want you to love me forever
Love me forever
I want you to love me forever

[Verse 3]
She love my life and she don't care
I flood my bitch and I don't care what they say about it
You just a diamond in the mine and you dirty
I like my bitches brown like James, no Worthy
Scratched out the alphabet, 'cept B bitch
Woah, she standing naked bookin' bhicken
Woah, I need them thick thighs on my chicken
You know, just got dropped off by Scotty Pippen
Woah, and I just wanna be loved

[Verse 1]
Do you feel alright?
Do you need me by your side?
We go out all night
Makes the pain hurt a little less
Do it one more time
'Cause it feels so justified
We go out all night
See you fall, pick you up again

[Pre-Chorus]
If your eyes are sad, it makes me sad too
You got me so overprotective, it's true
Feel like I would jump off buildings for you
It's okay, I'll watch you cry all night
I promise I won't let you go

[Chorus]
I'll pull you close, so close, so close
I'll never let you go, you know
Head on my chest, a silver cross
You can cry all night, I'll never let you go
I'll pull you close, so close, so close
I'll nevеr let you go, you know
Head on my chest, a silvеr cross
You can cry all night, I'll never let you go
(Never let you go)

[Verse 2]
Lie awake till dawn (Oh, oh)
We're face to face and palm to palm
Do you feel okay?
All your problems are far away (So far away)
Lying till it's true (Oh, oh)
It's alright, I'm trusting you
Do you feel okay?
Take a breath, make you feel safe

[Pre-Chorus]
If your eyes are sad, it makes me sad too
You got me so overprotective, it's true
Feel like I would jump off buildings for you
It's okay, I'll watch you cry all night
I promise I won't let you go

[Chorus]
I'll pull you close, so close, so close
I'll never let you go, you know
Head on my chest, a silver cross
You can cry all night, I'll never let you go
I'll pull you close, so close, so close

[Verse 2]
Don't bring friends around, I wouldn't— behind your back
That's the new rule, rules are rules
And not now then when, if not me then who?
You blacked out your page, went missing for days
They know you with me
You blacked out your page and switched up your boots
They know you with me
You switched up the Benz, you switched it again
I know what you need
You usually go combo, they don't even call you
They know you with me (Gonna set You free)

Your life finna change right now (It's gonna set You free)

[Chorus: Don Toliver]
What does it mean to find your soul?
Pay the toll on a broken road
Pay the toll on a broken road
What does it mean to find your soul?
Pay the toll on a broken road
Pay the toll on a broken road

[Verse: Kanye West & Don Toliver]
Baby, I'm free, baby, I'm free, like a homeless person
No matter how much you got, you can't own this person
Sometimes, I feel like the only honest person
When somebody snatch your soul
And karate didn't work
When you 'bout to lose all hope
The sun rose and opened roads
What if the surgeon really the serpent?
I paid for BBLs and Birkins
That wasn't me, that was Tyler Durdеn
I ain't gon' lie, I get tired of splurgin'
Lovе isn't perfect
Love is a version of bein' a virgin again
I was told it's how you interpreted it (What does it mean to find your soul?)
Pay the toll, pay the toll (Pay the toll on a broken road)
Pay the toll, pay the toll (Pay the toll on a broken road)

[Chorus: Don Toliver]
What does it mean to find your soul?
Pay the toll on a broken road
Pay the toll on a broken road
What does it mean to find your soul?
Pay the toll on a broken road
Pay the toll on a broken road

[Intro: Kim Kardashian]
I married the best rapper of all time
Not only that, he's the richest Black man in America
A talented, legit genius who gave me four incredible kids

[Verse 1: Sean Leon]
Let me not, let me not
I better not, it'd be best if I stop (Woo)
Let me not, go apeshit, full BAPE
I was down, no e— (Yeah, ayy)
I was down, no escape
I was down, ain't no escape
There's no escape
Lupe out my town, had to skate (Skate, kick, push)
We just said goodbyе, but it's straight (But it's straight, ayy)
I fuck with her vibe, it's okay (It's okay, ayy)
Got me hypnotizеd, in a daze
Protect my mind
Protectin' what's mine

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Welcome to the Sci-Fi
Make a choice, oxygen or Wi-Fi? (Wi-Fi)
Welcome to the Sci-Fi
Make a choice, oxygen or Wi-Fi? (Wi-Fi)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Do your thing now
Then and now, passin' out
When you lay down and I gave you the semen
I swear I heard God, the voice of Morgan Freeman (Freeman)
Baby, bye-bye, baby, baby, bye-bye
Baby, bye-bye, baby, baby, bye-bye
I'm just going to remove myself
From the situation 'fore I lose myself
From the situation 'fore I lose my health
I can't control you but I could lose myself

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Welcome to the Sci-Fi
Welcome to the Sci-Fi
Welcome to the Sci-Fi
Make a choice, oxygen or Wi-Fi?
Welcome to the Sci-Fi
Make a choice already, oxygen or Wi-Fi?!

Don't make it worse than what it is
I spent a church
I spent a church on a Benz

Lewinsky, treat me likе the President
Don’t look at me like I need medicine
Don't care what you heard
Don't care what you heard, CNN
Even friends got a E-N-D at the end

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Selfish, I just want you all to my own

Your **** give me mop right now
To finesse on the road outta town
Drink the pain up then smoke up the pound
Selling dope outta grandma house
Bust juugs at grandma house
Cut sixteen-hundred out a ounce
Bought a foreign, could barely pronounce
One chain and it cost 'bout a house
Had them all a couple fives then bounce
Go tomato on the guts, a Ferrari
Hit this new lick, I'm snatchin' Bugatti
Sippin' oil out the drank, it's exotic
Get paid just to talk out of pocket
Once you finish loading up, then you cock it
Think these bitches outta France got me cocky
Rappers take off with the lingo and chop it
Make me crush up the scene with no problem
Swearin' these **** gon' try me in Atlanta

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Hopped out the Uber, next thing you know, I bought Uber
Hopped out the Uber, next thing you know, I bought Uber

Tell yo' mama, "Come give me a kiss"
Security gon' need security for this

[Chorus]
I ain't gettin' frisked
I put your security at risk
I ain't gettin' frisked
Don't put the security at risk

Like, "We don't get paid enough for this"

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
True love shouldn't be this complicated
Thought I'd die in your arms
I thought I'd die in your—
True love shouldn't be this complicated
Thought I'd die in your arms
I thought I'd die in your—

[Verse: Kanye West]
No hard feelings, but my feelings harder
When I think about it, my eyes fill up with water
Don't have our daughters butterfly while they larvae
Wait, when you see the kids? I'll see y'all tomorrow
Wait, when the sun set? I see y'all tomorrow
Wait, when I pick 'em up, I feel like they borrowed
When I gotta return them, scan 'em like a bar code
Wait, no hard feelings, but these feelings hard though
Wait, who got the kids in thosе "What are those?"
Wait, why they can't wеar Yeezys with the cargos?
Y’all know Nike don't like me, y'all take it too far, though
At least have 'em in some Mike's, he played for Chicago
I only see three kids, who watchin' Chicago?
And you know all the nannies said, "Daddy in Nebraska"
Let the kids dig a tunnel to my house like Chapo
Only neighbor in the hood with a door they can knock on
I leave the light on

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Kanye West]
True love (Daddy's not gone) shouldn't be this complicated
(You see the light on)
Thought I'd die in your arms (Daddy's at home)
I thought I'd die in your— (Tell Gekyume)
True love (Daddy's not gone) shouldn't be this complicated (Tell Gekyume)
Thought I'd die in your arms (Daddy's at home)
I thought I'd die in your—

Tin soldiers and Nixon coming
We're finally on our own
This summer, I hear the drumming
Four dead in Ohio

[Chorus]
Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are cutting us down

And found her dead on the ground?
How can you run when you know?

To bring some loving here today, yeah

[Intro]
Old man, look at my life, I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life, I'm a lot like you were

[Verse 1]
Old man, look at my life
Twenty-four, and there's so much more
Live alone in a paradise
That makes me think of two
Love lost, such a cost
Give me things that don't get lost
Like a coin that won't get tossed
Rolling home to you

[Bridge]
Old man, take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
The whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
And you can tell that's true

[Verse 2]
Lullabies, look in your eyеs
Run around the same old town
Doesn't mеan that much to me
To mean that much to you
I've been first and last
Look at how the time goes past
But I'm all alone at last
Rolling home to you

[Bridge]
Old man, take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
The whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
And you can tell that's true

[Outro]
Old man, look at my life, I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life, I'm a lot like you were

[Verse 1]
I caught you knockin' at my cellar door
I love you, baby, can I have some more?
Ooh, ooh, the damage done
I hit the city and I lost my band
I watched the needle take another man
Gone, gone, the damage done

[Verse 2]
I sing the song, because I love the man
I know that some of you don't understand
Milk blood to keep from running out
I've seen the needle and the damage done
A little part of it in everyone
And every junkie's like a settin' sun

[Verse 1]
Tin soldiers and Nixon comin'
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drummin'
Four dead in Ohio

[Chorus]
Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are cutting us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her and
Found her dead on the ground?
How could you run when you know?

[Verse 2]
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ah, ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Ah, ah ah ah, ah ah

[Chorus]
Gotta get down to it
Soldiers are cutting us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her and
Found her dead on the ground?
How can you run when you know?

[Verse 1]
Tin soldiers and Nixon comin'
We're finally on our own
This summer I hear the drummin'
Four dead in Ohio
Four dead in Ohio

[Verse 1]
Never thought love had a rainbow on it
Used to think a cloud was a nightmare
That was up until when I first met you
Now I go around hoping you care

[Chorus]
Dance, dance, feel it all around you
Dance, dance, dance
Never thought love had a rainbow on it
See the girl dance

[Verse 2]
Mississippi mud never touched her fingers
California sand lies in her hand
Love her more than life as the daylight lingers
Early in the morning I'll be her man

[Chorus]
Dance, dance, feel it all around you
Dance, dance, dance
Mississippi mud never touched her fingers
See the girl dance
See the girl dance

[Chorus]
Dance, dance, feel it all around you
Dance, dance, dance
Never thought love had a rainbow on it
See the girl dance

[Intro]
(Ooh, alright)

[Verse 1]
Looking out, across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out, into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

[Chorus]
They say why, why?
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way?
Why, why?
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why? I like livin' this way

[Verse 2]
Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

[Chorus]
They say why, why?
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way?
Why, why?
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why?

[Bridge]
I like living this way
I like lovin' this way
I like loving this way
Another missin', Nah da da
Da na da da da
Da (I feel some bit of it)
Da la
Why, oh why?

[Verse 3]
Looking out, across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

[Chorus]
They say why, why?
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way?
They say why, why?
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, I like livin' this way
They say why, why?
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way?
I like livin' this way
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way?
I like lovin' this way
La nay
Da da da da da da da da
Da, da
Da da da da da da
Da, da
Da da da da da da da da

Da da da, that's human nature
Why, why?
Love that way
Da da da da da da da da

[Outro]
(Oh, interesting!)
(Ah)

[Verse 1]
When the winter rains come pouring down
On that new home of mine
Will you think of me and wonder if I'm fine?
Will your restless heart come back to mine
On a journey thru the past?
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?

[Verse 2]
Now I'm going back to Canada
On a journey thru the past
And I won't be back till February comes
"I will stay with you if you'll stay with me"
Said the fiddler to the drum
And we'll have good time on a journey thru the past

[Outro]
When the winter rains come pourin' down
On that new home of mine
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?
Will I still be in your eyes and on your mind?

I got a pocket full of hundred dollar bills
Put on a jacket, 'cause these diamonds give you chills
Two shots, I'm running, two and I'm stunning
Tonight, tonight, yeah
Look in the mirror, I'm like, "Who the hell is he?"
So many whips and cribs, I'm losing track of keys
Ooh, up to something, ooh, yeah, I love it
Alright, alright (Yeah-yeah)

If you ain't about money, then get gone
I wanna wild out all night long

It's only one life, you don't get two
So live life, don't let it live you

Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angels' order?

Every angel is terrifying

My gun it be thumping I don't need no bass
Put you on the news now you made the front page
Float on the beat like a boat in a lake

My Drako be singing it's dancing like Drake

You, you, you, you

[Verse 1]
You had me 'round your finger, you had me on the floor
I used to be your angel, now I'm walking out your door
You say I'm turning evil, I'll say I'm finally pure
Shine bright in my reflection, think I lost myself before

[Pre-Chorus]
Held me back, tied me up inside a cage
Had to change my life 'cause I knew you'd stay the same
Couldn't see you were standing in my way
I can see clearly now, now, now

[Chorus]
You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy
I'm finally free from your control
I don't need a kiss goodbye, I'm on my own tonight, oh
You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy
I'm finally free from your control
I don't need a kiss goodbye, I'm on my own tonight, oh

[Verse 2]
I'm like a flower blooming since I left you behind
Don't know what I was doing, thought your venom was divine
Knew you were turning evil, you said I lost my mind
No, you ain't gonna do me like that-at-at-at

[Pre-Chorus]
Held me back, tied me up inside a cage
Had to change my life 'cause I knew you'd stay the same
Couldn't see you were standing in my way
I can see clearly now, now, now

[Chorus]
You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy (So)
I'm finally free from your control (Control)
I don't need a kiss goodbye, I'm on my own tonight, oh
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah

[Outro]
La-la-la-la-la-la

You used to know me, now you don't

[Intro]
(I'll settle for the ghost of you)

[Verse 1]
Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I miss your touch some nights when I'm hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know

[Chorus]
That if I can't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (More than life)
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life, I miss you more than life

[Drop]
(And if you can't be next), I'll settle for the ghost of you
(I miss you more than life), want you to know
(And if you can't be next to me, your mеmory is oh)
I miss you more than life (I miss you more than lifе)

[Verse 2]
Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I need more time, but time can't be borrowed
I'd leave it all behind if I could follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know

[Chorus]
That if I can't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (More than life, yeah)
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy (Oh)
I miss you more than life, I miss you more than life

[Drop]
(And if you can't be next), I'll settle for the ghost of you
(I miss you more than life), want you to know
(And if you can't be next to me, your memory is oh)
I miss you more than life (I miss you more than life)

[Outro]
If I can't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life, I miss you more than life
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Do you experience nervousness or shakiness inside, faintness and dizziness? The idea that someone else can control your thoughts. Feeling others are to blame for most of your thoughts. Trouble remembering things, feeling easily annoyed and irritated. Feeling afraid in open spaces or in public. Thoughts of ending your life. Feeling that most people could not be trusted. Poor appetite, heart or chest pains?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I feel like this
I feel like this
I feel like that
I feel likе this all the time
I feel like that
I feel likе that
I feel like that
I feel like that all the time
Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Rich young nigga fuckin' bitches now
Might go cop a cutlass and no switches now
Free the gang yeah free the militia now
No Johnny Dang this water need some tissue now

[Verse: Chance The Rapper]
Fuck 12, every year I turn 11
I don't need no birthday I'll just celebrate in Heaven
And I love to watch her tryna squeeze into them leggings
Say she on the pills but I can tell that booty pregnant
You can spin this block, swear that shit a dead end
Thought it was a Glock, but it was an FN
Ride round like the president, you was just a resident
I play golf with drugs, but they don't ever see no evidence
And I'm on a-

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Rich young nigga fuckin' bitches now
Might go cop a cutlass and no switches now
Free the gang yeah free the militia now
No Johnny Dang this water need some tissue now

Comes a time when you're driftin'
Comes a time when you settle down
Comes a light, feelings liftin'
Lift that baby right up off the ground

[Chorus]
Oh, this old world keeps spinnin' 'round
It's a wonder tall trees ain't layin' down
There comes a time

[Verse 2]
You and I, we were captured
We took our souls and we flew away
We were right, we were giving
That's how we kept what we gave away

[Chorus]
Oh, this old world keeps spinnin' 'round
It's a wonder tall trees ain't layin' down
There comes a time
Comes a time, comes a time

[Verse 1]
Bruce Berry was a workin' man (Tonight)
He used to load that Econoline van
A sparkle was in his eye
But his life was in his hand
And people let me tell you
Late at night when the people were gone
He used to pick up my guitar
And sing a song in a shaky voice
That was real as the day is long

[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night

[Verse 2]
Well, early in the mornin' at thе break of day
He used to sleep until thе afternoon
If you never heard him sing
I guess you won't too soon
'Cause people let me tell you
It sent a chill up and down my spine
When I picked up the telephone
And heard that he died out on the mainline

[Chorus]
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night (Tonight's the night)
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night

[Verse 3]
Bruce Berry was a workin' man
He used to load that Econoline van
And early in the mornin' about the break of day
He used to sleep until the afternoon

[Outro]
Tonight's the night
Tonight
Night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight's the night
Tonight (Tonight's the night)
Tonight's the night
Tonight
Tonight
Woah
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks
Preoccupied with his vengeance
Cursing the dead that can’t answer him back
I’m sure that he has no intentions
Of looking your way, unless it’s to say
That he needs you to test his inventions

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won’t ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to

He looks so truthful, is this how he feels
Trying to peel the moon and expose it
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
If he needs a third eye he just grows it
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk
Or pick it up after he throws it

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won’t ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to
Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Their religion of the little tin women
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised
Come on out the dark is beginning

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won’t ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to

[Verse 1]
I come down from the misty mountain
I got lost on the human highway
Take my head, refreshing fountain
Take my eyes from what they've seen

[Refrain]
Take my head and change my mind
How could people get so unkind?
Oh now

[Verse 2]
I come down from the crooked mansion
And I married the D.J.'s daughter
Since that day I heard it mentioned
That my name is on the line

[Refrain]
Now my name is on the line
How could people get so unkind?
Oh now

[Verse 1]
I come down from the misty mountain
I got lost on the human highway
Take my head, rеfreshing fountain
Take my eyеs from what they've seen

[Refrain]
Take my head and change my mind
How could people get so unkind?
Oh now

[Intro]
Here's an old song I wrote a long time ago. Never could ever get to record it though, folks. Seems every time I tried to record this song, someone stepped in and stopped it. 

[Verse 1]
I come down from the misty mountain
I got lost on the human highway
Take my head, refreshing fountain
Take my eyes from what they’ve seen

[Refrain]
Take my head and change my mind
How could people get so unkind?

[Verse 2]
I come down from the crooked mansion
And I married the D.J.'s daughter
Since that day I heard it mentioned
That my name is on the line

[Refrain]
Now my name is on the line
How could people get so unkind?

[Verse 1]
I come down from the misty mountain
I got lost on the human highway
Since that day I've heard it mentioned
That my name was on the line

[Refrain]
Take my head and change my mind
How could people get so unkind?
Oh now
{verse 1}
Enough
So much
I’ll disappear
I cannot lie
All i got to do is wondering why when all I can do is sigh

{chorus 1}
It’s just too much for me
It's just too much for me
It's just too much for me
Cause I just can’t take it enough, enough
Enough is enough
Enough
Cause I just can’t take it no

{verse 2}
You are a ghost from hell
And my worst nightmare
Your stories everywhere
This ain’t no truth or dare
All I got to do is wondering why for you there’s no need to cry
Pre-chorus:
Please tell me why won't you just let me be

{chorus 2}
It’s just too much for me
It’s just too much for me
It’s just too much for me
Cause I just can’t take it
Enough, enough
Enough is enough
Enough
Cause I just can’t take it no
Oh no, oh no
But I just can’t take it, just can’t take it

Spoken bridge:
You stole my soul and ruined my reputation
You changed the mind of a whole new generation
You came to me when you were no-body
So I gave you my hand but all you took was my money. You wanted more, you wanted fame
When it didn’t work out, you were calling my name
It’s a shame
Now so many believe these stories about me
But the truth about you, the world never sees

{chorus 3}
It’s just too much for me
It’s just too much for me
It’s just too much for me
Cause I just can’t take it
Enough, enough
Enough is enough
Enough
Cause I just can’t take it no
It’s just too much for me
It’s just too much for me
It’s just too much for me
Cause I just can’t take it
Enough, enough
Enough is enough
Enough
Cause

[Verse 1]

[Verse 1]
You know it takes a long, long time
You know it takes a long, long time
You love her so and still you know
That you will never want to let her go
Unless you leave her first
Then you come out on top
But still there's just one thing
You haven't got

[Chorus]
Peace of mind
Like when you treated her kind
It's hard to face that open space

[Verse 2]
You know it takes a long, long time
You know it takes a long, long time
When first you gave and shared your soul
Showed her all those things that take their toll
Now she knows your weak spot
But she still gets you hot
And so you do it again
Reveal what lies within

[Chorus]
And go for peace of mind
Like when you treated her kind
It's hard to face that open space

[Post-Chorus]
You're lookin' for peace of mind
Anywhere you can find
Still searchin' for peace of mind

[Outro]
You know it takes a long, long time
You know it takes a long, long time
You know it takes a long, long time
You know it takes a long, long time

[Chorus]
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down?
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down?
I always get in trouble when you bring that around
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay it down?

[Verse 1]
Well I'm runnin', I'm runnin'
I'm runnin' down the proud highway
Oh yes, yeah I'm runnin', I'm runnin'
I'm runnin' down the proud highway (Ooh)
And as long as I keep movin'
I won't need a place to stay

[Chorus]
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down?
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down?
I always get in trouble when you bring that around
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay it down?

[Verse 2]
Well I'm here to deliver
I hope you can read my mail (Oh yeah)
I just escaped last night
From the memory county jail
I see your box is open and your flag is up
My message is ready if there's time enough (Time enough)

[Chorus]
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down?
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay your big spike down?
I always get in trouble when you bring that around
Motorcycle Mama
Won't you lay it down? (Lay it down)

[Verse 1]
Remember the Alamo
When help was on the way
It's better here and now
I feel that good today
I'd like to take a walk
But not around the block
I really got some news

[Pre-Chorus]
I met a man from Mars
He picked up all my guitars
And played me traveling songs

[Chorus]
And when we got on ship
He brought out something for the trip
And said "It's old but it's good"
Like any other primitive would

[Verse 2]
I wanna ride my llama
From Peru to Texarkana
I'm gonna ride it good
In my old neighborhood
My old neighborhood
My old neighborhood
My old neighborhood
My old neighborhood

[Intro]
You ready, Briggs?

[Verse 1]
Aurora borealis
The icy sky at night
Paddles cut the water
In a long and hurried flight
From the white man
To the fields of green
And the homeland
We've never seen

[Verse 2]
They killed us in our tepee
And they cut our women down
They might have left some babies
Crying on the ground
But the fire sticks
And the wagons come
And the night falls
On the setting sun

[Verse 3]
They massacred the buffalo
Kitty corner from the bank
And the taxis run across my feet
And my eyes have turned to blanks
In my little box
At the top of the stairs
With my Indian rug
And a pipe to share

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
I wish I was a trapper
I would give a thousand pelts
To sleep with Pocahontas
And find out how she felt
In the morning
On the fields of green
In the homeland
We've never seen

[Verse 5]
And maybe Marlon Brando
Will be there by the fire
We'll sit and talk of Hollywood
And the good things there for hire
And the Astrodome
And the first tepee
Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me
Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me
Pocahontas

[Verse 1]
Look out, Mama, there's a white boat coming up the river
With a big red beacon and a flag and a man on the rail
I think you'd better call John
'Cause it don't look like they're here to deliver the mail
And it's less than a mile away
I hope they didn't come to stay
It's got numbers on the side and a gun
And it's making big waves

[Verse 2]
Daddy's gone and my brother's out huntin' in the mountains
Big John's been drinkin' since the river took Emmy Lou
So the powers that be left me here to do the thinkin'
And I just turned twenty-two
I was wonderin' what to do
And the closer they got
The more those feelings grew

[Verse 3]
Daddy's rifle in my hand felt reassurin'
He said red meant run and numbers add up to nothin'
When the first shot hit the dock I saw it comin'
Raised my rifle to my eye
Never stopped to wonder why
Then I saw black
And my face splashed in the sky

[Verse 4]
Shelter me from the powder and the finger
Cover me with the thought that pulled the trigger
Just think of me as one you never figured
Would fade away so young
With so much left undone
Remember me to my love
I know I'll miss her

[Intro]
Country girl, I think you're pretty... That's as much as I know. 

Now here's a story I wrote one night when I was, uh, just sitting around on one of my friend's farms out there. We were gettin' high sittin' there in front of the, that old pot-belly. Thinkin' about what it could've been like. I turned over and said, wow, I wish I had my twelve-string with me right now. 

[Verse 1]
Aurora borealis
The icy sky at night
Paddles cut the water
In a long and hurried flight
From the white man
To the fields of green
And the homeland
We've never seen

[Verse 2]
They killed us in our tepees
And they cut our women down
They might have left some babies
Cryin' on the ground
But the fire sticks
And the wagons come
And the night falls
On our setting sun

[Verse 3]
They massacred the buffalo
Kitty corner from the bank
Taxis run across my feet
And my eyes have turned to blanks
In my little box
At the top of the stairs
With my Indian rugs
And a pipe to share

[Verse 4]
I wish I was a trapper
I would give a thousand pelts
To sleep with Pocahontas
And find out how she felt
In the morning
On the fields of green
In the homeland
We've never seen

[Verse 5]
And maybe Marlon Brando
Will be there by the fire
We'll sit and talk of Hollywood
And the good things there for hire
Like the Astrodome
And the first tepee
Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me
And Barbra and Muhammed Ali
John Ehrlichman and the First Family
Pocahontas and me

[Chorus: Nas & Snoop Dogg]
If God for me, who could be against me?
I guess all them niggas that's against me
They the ones stirrin' up the conflict
Then try to make it out like I'm conflicted
Bitches
East Coast niggas in six-fours hittin' switches (Shit)
It's not a conflict of interest
Cuh, them niggas with the business
West Coast niggas rockin' them Timberlands deep up in them trenches
It's no difference

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Neither one play games when swingin' for them fences
We want the finer things, the shit that's еxpensive
The shit that hit 'еm either close range or at a distance
If God for me, nigga, why bother?
I got my game from the Godfather (Woof)
Top of the food chain, rock bottom
And handled my business when it was my problem
G shit, nigga flossin' with a gold chain
I got my Turkish rope with matchin' gold fangs
Bomber jacker in the winter, it's a cold game
I met some East Coast niggas up in Spokane (What up?)
Some of the realest niggas in this dope game
I got my curly top, lookin' like Special Ed
Clean fade on the side, bumpin' that redhead
Clean tags when I ride, duckin' the fed-feds
East Coast niggas, they get that bread-bread
You fuck with them niggas, you end up dead-dead
Them West Coast niggas, they leave that lead spread
And now you got bullets all in your dread head

[Chorus: Nas & Snoop Dogg]
If God for me, who could be against me?
I guess all them niggas that's against me
They the ones stirrin' up the conflict
Then try to make it out like I'm conflicted
Bitches
Still tryna fuck the riches
East Coast niggas in six-fours hittin' switches (Shit)
It's not a conflict of interest
Cuh, them niggas with the business
West Coast niggas rockin' them Timberlands deep up in them trenches
It's no difference

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Fourth and inches
I'm finna hit a lick and handle business
I got a down bitch, she real vicious
Rock-a-bye baby, no witness
This is not even a conflict
You niggas on nonsense
Niggas die the same way in Brooklyn and Compton
But niggas with that gang-gang, them niggas make a profit
Niggas on top, niggas stay poppin'
Look, see, I was the high school Slick Rick, I was stylin'
Fat gold chain with an African medallion
Hip-hop connoisseur and Rollin' 20 Crippin'
Rap game real tight, freestyle was magnificent
All about the clout and all about my dividends
Them older niggas couldn't tell me different
I need a 'round the way girl to let me stick it in
Showtime at the Apollo
I'm drinking OE up out the bottle
Take two swigs and pour out a little liquor for my niggas who won't live to see tomorrow

[Chorus: Nas]
If God for me, who could be against me?
I guess all them niggas that's against me
They the ones stirrin' up the conflict
Then try to make it out like I'm conflicted

[Intro: October London]

[Interlude: October London]
Ah, ha, you can't just leave like that, Snoopy
You gotta stay a little while longer
You know that's what they want
Don't go

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Baby, I got to go far away for a while
And I don't think you can handle coming with me (No, uh-uh)
You know show after show, and mile after mile
And I don't think you can handle running with me
So I don't think you'll be coming with me

[Pre-Chorus: Snoop Dogg & October London]
I gotta go (Ah, I need you right back to me, Snoopy)
Look, baby, I got places to be and people to see
(I need you back in my arms, Snoopy)

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & October London]
(Snoopy, don't go, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I hate to leave but I have to

I hate to leave but I have to
(Snoopy, don't go, ooh, ooh)

[Outro: Snoop Dogg & October London]
(Snoopy don't, Snoopy don't, Snoopy, don't go)
Oh baby, I wish I had time to stay and play but
(Snoopy don't, Snoopy don't, Snoopy, don't go)
You know time is money and money is time, baba
(Snoopy don't, Snoopy don't, Snoopy, don't go)
I guess we can get together some other time
(Snoopy don't, Snoopy don't, Snoopy, don't go)
I hate to leave but I have to
Yeah, if you wanna go to a record label where the executive producer is all in the videos, rappin', and dancin'
Come to Death Row

Strokе a pole while I roll up, "Baby, lick this"

Hole in your cup, let me stir it softly
Come and be the kush to a nigga coffee

Macaroni pasta, sausage with the lobster
She love fuckin' on the mobster with a monster (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I'm more of a doctor then a sponsor
Fix whatever you need and then I'm out (La, la, la, la)
The deezo, mid-day swinign' it like a kilo
Snoop, Billy Dee mixed with D-Lo
'Cause I don't give a fuck about a easel but I keep a 4-five (What?)
A lover and a friend, I can be both sides
If ya, if ya, if ya need that (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
No frontin', I like hittin' it from the bizack
Now let me do ya how I do ya, then I send you on your way
Handle business then get back to the play (Okay)

[Chorus: Lil Duval & October London]
Whenever you need it (Need it)
I'll be there to beat it (Beat it)
Don't you worry (Don't worry)
Come on over and get this dick
It's not hard to find it (Find it)
When you could stop all your grinding (No, no, no)
I'll be there
So won't you come on over and get this dick
Whenever you need it (Whenever you)
I'll be there to beat it (Beat it)
Don't you worry (D-d-don't, d-d-don't worry)
Come on over and get this dick
It's not hard to find it (Find it)
When you could stop all your grinding (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'll be there
So won't you come on over and get this dick

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg & October London]
Okay baby, now it's dinner time
AKA let me get back, get back in it time (In it time)
Before the soul food come, have a sip of wine
Tequila shots with a hint of lime
No swine, so fine (Ooh yeah)
You walk, step to the stage, you get it, why?
You love the sound, you get louder than crowds
When I'm crowding up in your other space
Stop it girl, you makin' me make that other face (Ooh-ooh)
Get that ass above the face
While you wait (While you wait)
You're hot off the plate, I gotta taste
Grab your waist, drop ya face (No, no, no)
Boom, pow, you're done, I gotta shake
I got money to make, hold on

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Say, baby, it's been real
But I got to go
I got places to be and people to see
Oh yeah, COD
Cash on—

[Intro]
Say, my nigga, huh
You not gon' believe this shit when I tell you this, cuh
Nigga, I had the craziest motherfucking dream
Listen when I tell you this, my nigga
I had a dream I was back on Death Row Records
We gon' take a trip right now
Like we always do about this time
No, we didn't
Haha, yes, he did
What the fuck is up, niggas and niggettes? Oh, yeah
We back up in this motherfucker

[Verse]
You wouldn't believe me even if I told you niggas
My game is cold, I could still mold you niggas
Roll you niggas a fat stick of that chronic
A hundred sixty million dollar man (What?), bitch, I'm bionic
SN, lesson (Huh?), step in (What? Huh?), automatic weapon
Death Row, oh, no, can't lеt this shit go
I think about Pac, I think about Suge, I think about Nate
I think I left a small piеce on my plate
I'ma rework this shit and get a few things straight
Not here to debate, just simply wanna vibe and create
Smoke a little sticky-icky, drop my vocals on tape
And call my lil' cute bitch who loves smokin' on vapes
Let that settle in, Death Row back in (What up?)
Cuh gon' let 'em in (Ayy)
Ain't no love lost, nigga, understand me? (What?)
Those my carnales, that's my family (Haha)
We back on buzz
We ride for each other 'cause that's what it is, nigga
And that's what it was
Harry-O got freed up, unfinished business
We LLC'd up, Los Angeles G'd up

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, I don't love you no more

[Intro]
So Harry-O out, huh? (Yup)
Well you tell 'em I said pull up on me
I got a sandwich bag for 'em (Right, right, right)
(Right, right, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Never seen a bag that I ain't like
Lambchop with the doors off
Lil' bitch, you know I got a wife
As she proceed to take her clothes off
Self-driven, this the life I chose
My tunnel vision was somethin' like El Chopo's
Black Swan on my toes, watch for the potholes
I rather focus on how much water the pot holds
Started out breakin' records, now we breakin' records
Never thought I would be famous for my indiscretions
She up and down on my pole, but this ain't no elеction
I'm busy fuckin' the globe, bitch, I don't need protection
Corrеction; this my C-section, how ya livin'?
They makin' music but we on a different algorithm
Lookin' at life through a glass jar, cloudy vision
All I ever needed was one mic, Scottie Pippen

[Chorus]
I thought I told niggas this come with the territory
New gold digger, that come with the territory
The lifestyles of the rich get dangerous
Some die with a name, others die nameless
I heard they plottin' on me, that come with the territory
Keep that thang on me, yeah, that's self-explanatory
But I ain't scared, speakin' the truth will get you canceled fast
That's Dre drop, this type of talk come with a sandwich bag

[Verse 2]
I'm in this bitch with a double cup
She wanna smoke, lemme show you the ropes, double dutch
Time to level up, nigga, paper been long
Gators hangin' out the Lamb', Fred Flinstone
B-baller, s-shot caller
Twenty-inch blades and they on the impala
So many years in the game, I done became a Rottweiler
Survivor, with motherfuckin' diamonds on my collar
Made nigga, fuck yo' advice, really got a billi' in my sights
Blowin Za', reachin; new heights
Buckle up, we 'bout to take flight
Cartier froze, just watch
VV's drippin' on Watts
FedEx, I'm beatin' up the box
Bad bitches, drop it like it's hot

[Chorus]
I thought I told niggas this come with the territory
She a gold digger, that come with the territory
The lifestyles of a crip get dangerous
Some die with a name, others die nameless
I heard they plottin' on me, that come with the territory
I keep that rocket on me, yeah, that's self-explanatory
Tread light, homie, they don't understand the math
This real spill, this shit come with a sandwich bag

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Five, four, three, two, one
Yessir, haha
2022
Big Snoop D-O-Double G
Ayo Battlecat
You know what time it is, it's time to do this shit we usually do
Let's go
Hah
What's my name?
Say what?

[Chorus: October London & Snoop Dogg]
When times get tough, I want to give it up
And I just can't let go like that
And girl, how long it took to build it up
There must be some reason why he callin' back (I'm back)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I'm back in this bitch ready to do it again
Light that  Chronic, where my Gin?
They lettin' real niggas up out of the pen
Roller skate, now roll again
I hit my sweet spot, streets got back on lead
Beatbox, heat rocks, talk that shit
Plottin', plan it, bakin' inhale
Shakin' no shakin, while makin' demands
A lil' tension in the hood, but I'm loved by my fans
Same Dog stance and I get it from my hands
Really don't talk when its' time to do advance
Take a chance on yourself like I did on me
I was amazed like a kid on me
No smut, no shit on me
So far up, that I can't look now
But every once in a while I find my way back down

[Chorus: October London & Snoop Dogg]
When times get tough, I want to give it up
And I just can't let go like that (Man)
And girl, how long it took to build it up
There must be some reason why he callin' back (Can all the people say)

[Post-Chorus: October London & Snoop Dogg]
Woah (Yeah, c'mon)
Hah, yeah
And all the ladies in the back, lemme hear you say
Woah (Yeah, c'mon now)
Yeah, feel good to ya
Yeah, 'cause it's good for ya, c'mon
Yeah, get ya groove on
A-get ya skate on, roll on

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
Hey Doggy (Yeah)
What's that mean?
That means I'm back on the floor, get ya dough
Every player that I know give a fuck about a ho
Hey Doggy (Yeah)
What's that mean?
That means I'm back on the roll, gettin' more dough
And tell 'em Snoop Dogg said so

[Chorus: October London]
When times get tough, I want to give it up
And I just can't let go like that
And girl, how long it took to build it up
There must be some reason why he callin' back

[Outro]
(Yeah, so uh, heard you back on Death Row; That's right?)
Yeah, fasho

[Intro]
Snoop Dogg, what up, cuh?
What up, Snoop Dogg? What's up, my nigga?
What a G, what up, though, my nigga? What's happenin' with it?
Shit, you know me, my nigga (Blaze that shit up)
Aww, they in the 'Nati just doin' what I do, haha
Oh, for real? Sure, I could dig that
Oh, you wanna hear that?

[Verse]
What a G, nigga, I am where it's cookin' at
Nigga, ain't no lookin' back
Nigga, what you lookin' at?
Lost it in the dice game, took it back
Look at that nigga with the black on
Me and Tek back on
I'm the rapper, so I got to get my rap on
He's the producer with the bass
Now clap on, snap on my fit
Shoot it, shawty, hit it (Ooh)
Lit it slow, really, though, from the city, though
Where they kill for a penny
Shot him, saved him, sent him back to the hideaway
I'm tryna find a ride away
Grew up on the darker side, pray for a brighter day
Fuck the alphabet, PD and the C to the I, the A
Every nigga grab a K, aim it in the same way
Until they fuckin' go away
Bang it 'til they blow away
Tryna do a show a day
Raised my level, lowered my car
And shoot at these motherfuckin' fake rap stars (Nope)
I'd rather not, too much time to be taken
Ain't no fakin' when you cakin' and bakin'
And makin' moves like a CEO
Tellin' only cheat a ho
Threw up the set to seek a friend, a foe
'Cause I ain't got nothin' for 'em but some info
Small bag of indo, a pot to piss in
And a one-room flat so he can throw it out the window
Yep, Tek, this my intro, haha
Doggy, where you hangin' at?
Homie, can you bring it back?
We need some money and some things and a starter pack
A few tickets and we'll kick it back to you, loc
No thang, a friendly game of some gun smoke

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
I don't know them niggas
Nigga, why don't you roll up there with me?
Nigga, quit actin' scary
If we both go up there, it's gon' look like somethin' up
Now you know niggas get real paranoid when they see a gang of motherfuckers walkin' up

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Now this legendary shit is brought to you by
The D-O-double-G, twenty years of luxury
20 Crippin', fuck with me, east side hustler
Plus a cold motherfucker, you can't get enough of me
Ultramagnetic, these bitches gon' spread it for me
Chain lookin' sleepy, diamonds all embedded
Party poppin' like it's Beat Street, everybody lit
Everybody gettin' ready, summertime about to hit again
California's the spot (Spot)
I'm worldwide whether you like it or not (Not), hop in the whip (Whip)
Drop it and dip (Dip), top of the mornin', I'm out with a bitch
I'm in these streets clockin' a grip (Money)
I'm never gon' slip, never gon' fall off, grab that sawed-off
Everything above your neck (Baow), I blow that all off
You ain't in my bracket (Bracket) or my status quo
Snoop Dogg in the party with the baddest ho, let's go (Let's go)

[Chorus: HeyDeon]
Cruisin' down the 405 (405), yes
Take a break to catch a vibe (Catch a vibe)
Summertime I come alive (Come alive)
Happy, catch a vibe (Vibe), catch a vibe (Vibe)
Cruisin' down the 405 (405), yes
Take a break to catch a vibe (Catch a vibe)
Summertime I come alive (Come alive)
Happy, catch a vibe (Vibe), catch a vibe (Vibe)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Take a puff, flip the page, continue the story
I control the big stage, got fame and the glory
Money in the bank, from the streets to the business suites
From the Beach to executive meetings, more money, two million this week, nigga
From a street killer to a multi-million dollar weed dealer
Homies told you don't bring the bitch, Doggy Dogg might leave with her
The breadwinner (The breadwinner), I'm so rich and I'm never bitter
Runnin' game like a treadmill, cold nigga, big winner
Cruisin' down the 405, choose a place, yours or mine
We can make this legal paper, no need to read between the lines
Now we talkin' stocks and bonds, NFTs and cryptos
The money profit crackin', so to the bank a Crip go
I'm all about investments, I'm all your homies' reference
My boss moves on the top news, Snoop Dogg, he do not lose
The homie built a new franchise, needed one million, so I dropped two
Showed the nigga what the guap do when I stop through and I pop through and I got you

[Chorus: HeyDeon]
Cruisin' down the 405 (405), yes
Take a break to catch a vibe (Catch a vibe)
Summertime I come alive (Come alive)
Happy, catch a vibe (Vibe), catch a vibe (Vibe)
Cruisin' down the 405 (405), yes
Take a break to catch a vibe (Catch a vibe)
Summertime I come alive (Come alive)
Happy, catch a vibe (Vibe), catch a vibe (Vibe)

[Intro]
Ayo, Dogg, what's happenin' with motherfuckin' hip-hop, man?
Give us some lyrics, cuh
Some of that real hip-hop, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Boy, you lost it, nigga

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
It was him (Who?) then me (Who?) and no one after
So I blazed my trail and wrote my own chapters
Stomped down pterodactical raptors
Game's sustained, my new jersey's in the rafters

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Statisticians, they keep up with it
No sleep 'til they get it
And once they got it, they count it
So I learned how to dismount it
My landing was perfect
A man with a purpose
I learned to resurface
A boss but no workers
While you're sleepin', I'm lurkin'
I'm shifty at fifty, I keep the work and I'm workin'
Big Snoop D-O-double-G
Yеllow like bumblebee
Mellow likе R&B
Your bitches keep followin' me
I'm right where I oughta be
Plottin' my pottery
I'm watchin' my calories
Rechargin' my batteries
A ticket up front? That's my usual salary
They imitatin' my style, shit, I call it flattery
I'm here forever, nigga, and that's just what that'll be
Look it up, hook it up
Charge it to the game until you book it up
Take a picture, nigga, look at us
Hit-Boy and Snoop Dogg in the kitchen, nigga, cookin' up

[Interlude: The Game]
Ayy, Dogg, get on the phone with Dre, tell Dre call Interscope, tell them niggas run me my shit or else, nigga

[Verse 2: The Game]
The Game's to be sold, Blood, not to be told, Blood
The chronic get broke down, Backwoods get rolled up
Yup, fifty Bloods when I showed up
What's beef? Chopper turnin' niggas into cold cuts
Snoop told me, "Show love," but niggas ain't deserve it
I'ma talk my shit like I'm the next rapper murdered
Red sedan swervin' with the Peter Pan workin'
Hand-to-hand serve 'em right outside of Tam Burgers
Bullets ain't got no names, my fully quick to aim
I bully niggas for change, I pulled in to rip the strings
Puppet master, F&N's got 'em duckin' faster
Aftermath, you niggas know it ain't nothin' after
I can't chill 'til I see a hundred mil'
Hop off a PJ in Aruba with a blunt and chill
My old apartment still in action, water runnin' still
And if I can't kill you, these L.A. summers will

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
It was him then me and no one after
So I blazed my trail and wrote my own chapters
Stomped down pterodactical raptors
Game's sustained, my new jersey's in the rafters (Nigga)

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah
2022
Death Row Records
'Nough said

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, this is dedicated to the niggas that was down from day one
Welcome back

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Every time I turn around, every time they hear my sound
They get me all up underground, still inside the box
Fuck what they say, just be, the Black folk like it, it's a hit
How can this true gangster shit be still outside the box?

[Verse 1: Snoop
