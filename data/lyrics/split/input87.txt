'
Gather some sherm, pack, and a black magnum
Through Wyatt's mad dog and a pit bull if it watched
Stop, no need to be moving backwards
Besides, your future brighter than half of these rappers
So what's the point of going back to the drug side?
'Cuz everybody knows that G's certified
What the fuck, you dumb as fuck
Oh, what, you jealous fool?
Cuz I know Malone, Keke Loc', and his brother Pool
Plus the Seventh Street-
Man you ain't nothin' but bad bitch
Aye, Malone, if your with it lemme get an ad-lib (yeah)

[Interlude]
"Meet Jay Rock, former quote unquote 'Menace to Society', now Warner Brothers recording artist dealing with the sudden uncertainties of even having his first official single released. He finds himself struggling, daily to overcome the temptations triggering his old criminal ways.  At this moment, his conscience comes into play..."

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & 

[?]]
Watt's finest
I told G he wit it
He said he bout to go OT
Forget it
I won't let you fuck up Watt's career
Woah, calm down
Somebody's getting sensitive here
You fucking right because you know Jay Rock is my favorite
Man you got a song with Lil Wayne and still ain't made it
Plus you just had a baby
So I know that shit is stressin'
Know how much pampers cost ya
We live in a recession
I suggest you rob tomorrow
Whatever in sight, whatever you like
And if that bitch resists tell that bitch goodnight
Like that's gon' make a difference
I know it will
What, prison?
I'm just sayin' what he like to do best
What?
Stealin', robbin', jacking guys for nice cars
Like the nigga did in 17
Did you say nigga?
It was a joke you know what I mean
I mean, I hope you know what I mean
Why you mad?
You're acting mean
I mean, you said the same thing earlier
What the fuck you worried for?
I thought we was a team man
You trippin' man
You glitchin'
You don't get it
You was right
You are different
You fuckin' right
Why the hells you gotta fuck with the future of Watts?
Okay, okay
Lets see the choice he makes before his album drops *Static*

[Murdoc]
Look
Did anyone go through a transformative experience on the moon?
I know I did
I was through a monolith
Oh, yeah! My portal!
And when I got through the portal I thought I wasn't gonna make it

[2D]
Oh, no...

[Murdoc]
And I dived... I dived through and I ended up in Hong Kong Studios
Hmmm...

[2D]
Ye
Maybe look for positivity... in things?

[Murdoc]
Oh no, never

[2D]
-and you'll be taken on a positive path

[Murdoc]
I don't do positive

[Russel]
Sa... sau... sausages in space?

[Murdoc]
Yeah
Some of them went into orbit, y'know
So the Earth looked like Saturn

[Noodle]
Sorry, what are we talking about?
I kind of tuned out

[Russel]
He was cool, but he was kind of weird

[Murdoc, Russel]
Oh, yeah (yeah)
Well, we only work with weird, don't we?
We don't work with 'normal'

[2D]
Oh, they're definitely weird afterwards

[Verse: Robert Smith]
Spinnin' around the world at night
Spin around in black and white
Spinnin' around until the Sun comes up
Strange time to see the light

[Chorus: Robert Smith]
Spinnin' around the world at night
Spin in and out of sight
Spinnin' around until the Sun comes up
Strange time to see the light
Spinnin' around the world at night
Spin around in black and white
Spinnin' around until the Sun comes up
Strange time to see the light

[Outro: Robert Smith]
Strange time to feel alive

[Intro]
Yuh
It's Dream$Team on 'em
Yeah, listen

[Verse]
Thinking they know me but they are just guessing
You get what you give, yeah that's a lesson
I thank god, life itself is the blessing
We movin' forward, all we do is progressing
Feeling like Jonas and younger than life
Elevating, goin' to new heights
Had long days and cold nights
But now it's us, time to see my rights
Yeah, I've grown up in the 

[?], bunch up in a cross
Brain never yield, money minimal, of course
Every day there's another loss, just a different corpse
Just a lil' kid, mom and dad divorced
So the big boy's making money
They weren't doing no jobs
They were breaking laws, I was breaking jaws, 

[?] at the Lambo, suicide doors
So they told me, "stick to spitting bars, or you be like behind 'em"
Rise and shoot boy, that be rilin'
Corner of 

[?], where you find 'em
See all I'm tryna do is sell my story
And make a living that's the ultimate glory
You cannot stop me, nobody can rob me
Get out of the way, goin' all out like Rocky
Want to get to the top, keep climbing, keep shinin'
Polish us and we a diamond, I ain't lying
We keep going up, haven't broken a sweat, shit ain't tiring
We can go for miles and through the pain we be smiling

[Outro]
That's real shit boy (That's real shit boy)
Uh, uh
And that's real boy
Yuh (That's real boy, that's real boy)
Ya'll already know that this is Dream$Team
Y'all already know

[Verse 1]
Tell me, what you see everywhere
Are you free to take a walk with me?
On a nice night, moonlit
Neon quiet tealight
What to talk about?
I don't really care

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm freaking out, arms are shaking
Oh everywhere, I believe I am right where I belong
Oh, universe
Oh, wild child with little legs to walk me home
Oh, to walk me home

[Verse 2]
(Woo)
Step one to break your fall (Break your fall)
A little frustration
And then I know way to grow tall (To grow, grow, grow, grow)
It all starts with that two stеp
And a jump to the left
And a step into thе world
That's right, that's right

[Chorus]
Now I'm freaking out, arms are shaking
Oh everywhere, I believe I am right where I belong
Oh, universe
Oh, wild child with little legs to walk me home
Oh, to walk me home

[Verse 1]
Let us buy a little house we can fix up
Move it all in your girlfriend’s truck
We’ll need some plants in our rooms, lots of cartoons
A dirty carpet for a witch’s broom
We’ll need a market down the street, roller skates for our feet
A local laundromat where we’ll watch TV
And a pawn shop not far, you can lend your guitars
And buy ‘em back when there’s more bread in the jar

[Chorus]
And that’s all, that we’ll need to get by
We’ll bring our neighbor’s some coffee, peppers, and cherry-lime

[Verse 2]
We’ll have a dog with one eye, a cat that climbs across our chipped fence, a palm outside (a palm outside)
Smoke on your pipe, while I sip on my beer
We’ll pack our worries up away for the year
And if it all works as planned, maybe someday we can
Live off on some distant beach in a van
We’ll have a garden that rises up in the spring
And color it in in some paint-stained jeans

[Chorus]
And that’s all, that we’ll need to get by
We’ll bring our neighbor’s some demo tapes of you and I

[Outro]
And that’s all (And that’s all)
That we’ll need to get by (We'll need to get by)
And that’s all (And that’s all)
That we’ll need to get by (We'll need to get by)
We’ll have our neighbor’s come by, And join us for a fish fry

[Verse 1]
Round and round, it's all the same
On my chariot
Spelled in fire, I saw her name
Sophie carry us

[Chorus]
Yeah, you and me
Like a thousand years of reachin' for the light
Soar, we are free
In a dream I dreamed a thousand times tonight
Sophie and I, la la la la la la
Sophie and I

[Verse 2]
Round and round and round again
On my chariot
Came a fire to melt a man
Fall to marry us

[Chorus]
Yeah, you and me
Like a thousand years of reachin' for the light
Soar, we are free
In a dream I dreamed a thousand times tonight
Yeah, you and me
Like a thousand years of reachin' for the light
Sophie and I, la la la la la la
Sophie and I

[Instrumental Outro]

[Chorus]
I pull up, in a yellow Lambo' like Pikachu (Oh, yeah)
My teachers said I wouldn't be shit, now look at you (Oh)
I know you're somewhere, down bad
'Cause I just spent your whole check on a pair of some Jimmy Choo's (Oh, yeah)
I got nothing to prove, but a whole lot to lose
My mama used to sell drugs to pay for my school
My uncle Dub got knocked and ended up on the news
This all I know, I had to do this, I couldn't pick and choose

[Verse]
I used to pray for some better days
Ten years later, I'm in L.A. whippin' that Bentayga
I'm paid up with entertainers, Henny, no chaser
And bad bitches by the cases, they entertain us
I know my ex-bitch down bad and regretting
Leavin' me and watchin' every little thing I do
I know my old friends tell they new friends
That I switched up and tell 'em stories that were never true
Shit ain't nothin' new (Nah), I'm livin' comfortable
How the fuck you hating? Just two years ago, I was like you
Ninth grade, dropped out of school, used to sleep on JD's couch
This year I bought my mom a house, who would've knew that I would?

[Chorus]
Pull up, in a yellow Lambo' like Pikachu (Oh, yeah)
My teachers said I wouldn't be shit, now look at you (Oh)
I know you're somewhere, down bad
'Cause I just spent your whole check on a pair of some Jimmy Choo's (Oh, yeah)
I got nothing to prove, but a whole lot to lose
My mama used to sell drugs to pay for my school
My uncle Dub got knocked and ended up on the news
This all I know, I had to do this, I couldn't pick and choose

[Outro]
Yeah, I get to thinking of this shit, it's like, hm, look
Never did you wrong, never told you nothing wrong, no
I always kept it one hundred from the jump, oh
I always tried to keep it cool, but you were so cold (I did)
There's a lot more to the story that they don't know (Oh, woah)
There's a lot more to the story than the photo (Oh, oh)
There's a lot more to the story and we both know
But it's okay, I'll be good, no, oh
Long as my money right, I'll be good, no, oh
Long as my bitch fine, I'll be good, oh-oh
Long as the circle tight, then I'm good, on God

[Intro]
(Scared, scared)
Don't be mad, I know
(Scared, scared) Mad

[Pre-Chorus]
I leave in the morning don't be mad, I know
I know you got some things hurting you bad, although
I got a million voices in my head, hollow
All of them keep telling me to go

[Chorus]
Honestly lately

My brain, so I go
Off

[Verse 2]
Feeling I think I'll get in the car
Gotta get out of my head, but I'm looking at who you are
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
I lie to myself
I don't want no one else
All along (Oh)
Yeah, I was wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
I leave in the morning don't be mad, I know
I know you got some things hurting you bad, although
I got a million voices in my head, hollow
All of them keep telling me to go

[Chorus]
Honestly lately
Honestly lately
Honestly lately, I wanna throw 'em all away
Honestly lately
Honestly lately and just lay with you all day
Lay with you all day
'Til it all goes gray
Lay with you all day
'Til it all goes gray

Gazing at horizons but never quite reaching them

In the evening when the sun goes down
You can find us hanging around
We don't come to play, we work for keeps
People talk about us in the streets
They all come from miles around
Just to see what we've been putting down
Dirty or wrong, we come from the mud
Only a few can roll like us

Shut down your home
Grab your bag and take it home

This kind of work depends on every man
Gotta be on point for when we hit again

[Chorus]
You got a man, but you're messin' around
Risking it all, baby, just to get down
You got a man, but you're messin' around
Risking it all, baby, just to get down

[Verse 1]
Don't know if you know just what you're starting
But I can see you like to play with fire, darling
Your man just hit the bar to grab a chalice for you two
He turned his back just for a second, look at what you do
Sending me the supersonic signal
You ain't lay a finger, but I feel you
Independent woman, I won't tell you how to act
But you and I both know we could be gone 'fore he gets back

[Chorus]
You got a man, but you're messin' around
Risking it all, baby, just to get down

[Verse 2]
Lookin' over you're shoulder 'cause you better
If he was standin' next to you, you'd never (ahh)
I'm not usually one to sympathize for other guys
'Cause if she's even looking, he ain't doing somethin' right
Step by step she's dancing, gettin' closer to me

[?], head on collision (ahh)
Slides a cardboard coaster in my pocket, then proceeds
To burnin' up the floor where he expecting her to be

[Chorus]
You got a man, but you're messin' around
Risking it all, baby, just to get down

[Bridge]
You know, I know, you're so wrong for
What we've been doing, this place seems to ruin this love thang

You know that I know, you're so wrong for
What we've been doing, this place seems to ruin this love thang
(But I'm only half as wrong as you)

[Chorus: T.I.]
Heard somebody say I wasn't poppin'
Well, they been misinformed, I got a hundred K in my pocket
I be outside totin' carbon
With the young niggas shootin' like Harden, nigga, beg your pardon
I just put the Patek on a throwaway
Shawty tried to take a nigga soul away, beg your pardon
Big body Rolls give me road rage
Swervin' in an Aston Martin, nigga, beg your pardon
Heard somebody say I wasn't poppin'
Well, they been misinformed, I got a hundred K in my pocket
I be outside totin' carbon
With the young niggas shootin' like Harden, nigga, beg your pardon
I just put the Patek on a throwaway

Swervin' in an Aston Martin

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Well, if I may speak freely, we gon' get a bag if we need it
Bust it down, flip it, repeat it
Suckas be greedy, we was never playin' in the game
If we was, before we lost, we cheated
Hold up, they ain't made a game you can play on me
I just be prayin' for these niggas that they prey on me
They got another thing comin', homie, they gon' see
I got the blessings of an angel every day on me
Okay, church, nigga used to ask me where I'm from
Tell 'em Bankhead, nigga, but the earth my turf
Work, wonder what's up under my shirt
Wonder why I ain't gettin' searched
Nigga, TIP been solid, speak against his name in the hood
And you will get slapped out 'bout it
Had straps out wildin', but moments in the past
Just made me who I am, that's why I don't run from it
Keep it one hunnid', anyone who don't like it, then fuck 'em
Get a little money then double, level
Came a way from sellin' weed in the envelope
To Puff Daddy standin' with me in chinchilla
Road run, Rubber Band Man
Made a hundred mil' off of fifty grand man, well, goddamn
My suggestion is that you follow your dreams in this bitch
Put your heart in this shit, you bound to get rich, no cap

[Chorus: T.I.]
Heard somebody say I wasn't poppin'

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I just wore two million worth of jewelry to an interview
I got people askin' me, "What the fuck done got into you?"
I done put it all on the line, I knew that the rent was due
Hard to go and get it, no trippin', it wasn't no handouts
Corner store got hot, we start sellin' 'em out my man house
We ain't never have nothin', stay pullin' bands out
I been runnin' it up and I heard he ran out
Know these pussy niggas wishin' shit would fan out, it won't
"How you make the gun go on safety?" It don't
"You that young turnt nigga, Baby?" For shit, sure
Never in my feelings 'bout a broad, she can hit, bro
Red inside, Rolls truck, call it Big Boat
Heard a nigga say he want smoke
Switch out my clip on my pole, had to add a lil' more
I ain't really up for no arguin'
Nigga said he gon' do what? Bitch, beg your pardon

[Chorus: T.I.]
Heard somebody say I wasn't poppin'
Well, they been misinformed, I got a hundred K in my pocket

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Shut up, sucka nigga, get up
Crazy in your head thinkin' you can get us hit up
Foreign, automotives all on my lawn
Yawn, did this so long, it's gettin' borin'
Tapped into the culture, made a motherfuckin' lifestyle
Shoutout to my niggas doin' trap music right now
And you know we ain't with the hype, million on the mic
Get to switchin' out a queen just 'cause she ain't what we like, ay
I'm a king, done my thing from the green to the white
When you finished with opinions, I got four or five classics
Say I ain't the shit, that nigga must be dippin' acid
Fuck what all them other niggas doin', all I know is keep goin'
Start gettin' money, enjoyed it
Started sellin' crack for employment
Make it out of Georgia, that was a nigga only intent
Get them suckas out the way and get rich
Blockin' my path, boy, the .40 cal start barkin'
Like my nigga DMX in this bitch
I'm a vet at this shit, and all I ever been was authentic
Twenty years, I been handlin' my business
Get in my bag, stackin' my pennies
Buyin' everything on the west side of the city
'Cause that's where all the niggas don't play about TIP
So what I care 'bout what you got to say about TIP?
Nigga, beg your pardon

[Chorus: T.I.]
Heard somebody say I wasn't poppin'
Well, they been misinformed, I got a hundred K in my pocket

Swervin' in an Aston Martin, nigga, beg your pardon

[Verse 1]
Let me check my chest, my breath right quick
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it, bad
Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my - sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and tittiеs (Titties, titties)

[Bridge]
It's been a long time sincе you, you (Quiet)
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip, zip, zip (Quiet)
All of them bitches hating I have you with me, with me (Quiet)
You ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Quiet)
You ain't ever even been impressed like this, this, this

[Verse 2]
It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? Do tell, my love
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry

[Chorus 1]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

[Verse 3]
Do that, do that, baby, all night long (Don't stop) (Hey)
And I'ma turn off all my phones
You know I hate it when I'm left on read (Don't stop) (Hey)
But he make it all up in the bed
And he take me out, dinin' on nothin' but the best
He got Off-White on right, damn, he can dress
Makin' plans from the East, bands in the West
Rockstar, Black Beatles type, bands on his bread
And baby, I want it, and I'll just be honest (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
'Cause I just can't front when I look at you
Just keep it one hundred, when I throw these hundreds
I hope that your ass gon' know what to do

[Chorus 2]
Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's my shit, that's my wave
Do it like that and I'll repay it
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid
Just like that, come my way
'Cause I like it

Said I like it

[Outro]

I see the lights, dancing, dancing in your eyes
So how do I begin to tell you now
That I can be the one to bring your angel out?
In this life of sin

[Pre-Chorus]
I can be your muse, I can be your ally
I can be your moon, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven tonight
Put your hands together and close your eyes

Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me

[Post-Chorus]
They say love is religion

[Verse 2]
There's a fire rising in my heart like a choir
I can hear them singing our favourite song
The one that played while I was layin' in your arms
Just let me stay in your arms 'cause

I can be your gold, I can be your delight
I can be feed your soul, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven for life
Put your hands together and close your eyes

They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me

Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not whеre you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see mе dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

No, I won't be, won't be one
Won't be one

Somewhere in the middle, I
Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at easе
Pretty please
I need your hands on mе
Sweet relief
Pretty please

Exactly where I want me, yeah
Underneath your body, yeah
If we take it further, I swear I ain't gonna break
So, baby, come try me
Baby, come find me
Baby, don't wind me up

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty
Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me
When your kisses climb
Oh, you give me sweet relief
Made me feel so pretty
Would you help me out, please? (Woo)

[Post-Chorus]
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love

'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

[Verse 2]
I dedicate this verse to
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah
You always let me down, boy
But when you're going down, I get so up
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

[Bridge]
Yeah, we don't know how to talk
But damn, we know how to fu—

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

I can't teach a man how to wear his pants (Haha)
(Future nostalgia)

[Chorus]
I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe, but can't handle my sound
My sound, my sound (Future nostalgia)
I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe, but can't handle my sound
My sound, my sound (Future nostalgia)

[Outro]

(Future nostalgia)
My sound, my sound, my sound (Future nostalgia)

[Verse 1]
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

[Verse 2]
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn (Goddamn), you got me in love again

[Chorus]
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn (Goddamn), you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again

[Bridge]
Dance a-, dan-dance anymore
Dance a-, dan-dance anymore
Dance a-, dan-dance anymore
Dance, dan-dance anymore
Dance a-, dan-dance anymore
Dance a-, dan-dance anymore
Dance a-, dan-dance anymore
Dance, dan-dance anymore

[Outro]
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Goddamn

[Verse 1]
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me now
Don't start caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survivе you
I'm better on the othеr side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Post-Chorus]
Don't start caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me now
Don't start caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me now

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me now
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Don't start caring about me now
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me

[Verse]
Somewhere in the middle, I
Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window (Gonna break, gonna break)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please
Pretty

[Verse 2]
Exactly where I want me, yeah
Underneath your body, yeah
If we take it further, I swear I ain't gonna break
So, baby, come try me
Baby, come find me
Baby, don't wind me up

Pre
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me
Sweet relief

[Verse 1]
Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad
Messing with my head
We drive each othеr mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Pleasе, come take it out on me
I know it's really bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

[Post-Chorus]
Ahh
Mmm
Hey, ah

[Verse 2]
I dedicate this verse to (Verse to)
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah (Oh)
You always let me down, boy (Oh, oh)
But when you're going down, I get so up (So up)
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist (Ah-ha)

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad
Messing with my head
We drive each other mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me
I know it's really bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

[Post-Chorus]
Ahh
That's what makes us good in bed
Hey, ahh

[Bridge: Take A Daytrip]
Sometimes I think about you, you know?
I can't get you out of my mind
It's like an addiction
I can't stop
I love you

[Outro]
Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Well, I was born... I was born to boogie
People, I was born... said I was born to boogie
Come on boogie now

Everybody born to boogie
Every little person born to boogie
Even our old people should boogie
I'm gonna boogie

Every roadie should boogie
Every grandmother should boogie
I think the Pope could boogie... he got soul
I said the Pope's got soul
The Pope got soul
I used to hurry a lot, I used to worry a lot
I used to stay out till the break of day
Oh, that didn't get it
It was high time I quit it
I just couldn't carry on that way

Oh, I did some damage, I know it's true
Didn't know I was so lonely, till I found you

You can go the distance
We'll find out in the long run (in the long run)
We can handle some resistance
If our love is a strong one (is a strong one)

People talkin' about is
They got nothin' else to do
When it all comes down we will
Still come through

In the long run
Ooh, I want to tell you, it's a long run
You know I don't understand why you don't
Treat yourself better
Do the crazy things that you do
'cause all thе debutantes in Houston, baby
Couldn't hold a candle to you

Did you do it for lovе?
Did you do it for money?
Did you do it for spite?
Did you think you had to, honey?

Who is gonna make it?
We'll find out in the long run (in the long run)
I know we can take it
If our love is a strong one (is a strong one)

Well, we're scared, but we ain't shakin'
Kinda bent, but we ain't breakin'
In the long run

Ooh, I want to tell you, it's a long run
In the long run
In the long run...

[Verse 1]
A 'Bama red 4Runner pulled into the party
With a 30-A sticker on the back windshield
Two-tone tank top slippin' off her shoulder
Kinda girl when she steps out, the world stands still

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I know where this is goin'
I already know it

[Chorus]
She's somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
Shе's somebody's problem and somebody's problеm's
About to be mine
About to be mine

[Verse 2]
Kinda girl once you've had her, you can't stand to lose her
Kinda girl where your friends tell you don't F it up
Kinda girl that goes from tryin' to just to get her number
To slidin' through the summer to talkin' 'bout love

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I think I'm likin' where it's goin'
I'd like to try me some of

[Chorus]
Somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's
About to be mine
About to be mine

[Bridge]
Oh, hey baby, don't just keep me wishin'
Oh, let me get to fixin'

[Chorus]
Somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's
About to be mine
About to be mine
About to be mine
About to be mine
Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach

Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home

But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back
And your sunglasses on, baby

And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy
Remember how I made you scream
Now I don't understand what
Happened to our love
But, baby, I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
I see you walking real slow and you're
Smiling at everyone

And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

Out on the road today I saw a Black Head
Sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said:
"Don't look back, you can never look back"

I thought I knew what love was
What did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go, but...

But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got that top pulled down
And that radio on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got that hair slicked back
And those Wayfarers on, baby
And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
The city's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge mе (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gonе

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

[Bridge]
I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (Ooh)

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Outro]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch

It's operation get rich, and I ain't buying bottles

But all the ones that taught me

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Chance the Rapper]
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Chance the Rapper)

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust (Woo)
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us (Ah)
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so ho-ho-ho-holy
Lyrics from Snippet:

[Intro]
Has M.I.A. evolved though?
I mean, really evolved though?
She just keeps sampling Tamil songs
And, uh, if you take the Tamil songs out of those songs
I mean, do you really have songs?

[Verse 1]
Ahhhh, I look alive keep it futuristic
Even Optimus Prime is an optimistic
I'm a natural chick, and my raps lipstick
Realistic to the game, unlike your magic trick

[Chorus]
Bring 'em higher, fire, higher
Getting higher, higher, higher
Bringing fire, fire-

[M.I.A. on Instagram Live]

[Pre-Chorus]
Spread my wing to the wall,

[Intro]
Baby
B-b-b-b-baby
Come on girls
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 1]
You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you ‘til you can't come down

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Makе him express how he feels
And maybе then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 2]
Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

[Bridge]
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey hey

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

Express yourself
Respect yourself, hey hey
So if you want it right now, better make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
Express yourself

[Intro]
God?
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Verse 1]
I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Verse 2]
Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control
Just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me
It's like a dream
Let the choir sing

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Interlude]
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

[Chorus]
Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

[Bridge]
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me (Mmmm...)

Lil' chef Remy, how the fuck are you doin'
Pullin' on my hair get the man fuckin' movin'
Now I'm eatin' good when you're making ratatouille
This shit's so fuckin' good that I call you ratatouille
Put it in the pot, it's the best, how you do it?
I can get the groceries if you can do the cooking
Cheese and the strawberry at the same time
We can make dessert while we drink the wine
Write a couplе songs, do 'em in the same day
And thеy all sound the same 'cause they're made the same way
Everything's boring but you make a good plate
Everything's cool when.. you make a cake
Everything is sick when you're making sous vide food
I love to eat it and love to feel good
Yeah, you making really good food, yeah
You're a rat and that's so crazy

[Spoken: Remy from "Ratatouille"]
This is me. I think it's apparent that I need to rethink my life a little bit. What’s my problem? First of all, I'm a rat

Which means, life is hard

[Intro]
I'm backin' up, backin' up, backin' up, backin' up, cause my daddy taught me good
I'm backin' the hell outta there, and I'm like oh my God, oh my God, my God
I'm backin' up, backin' up, backin' up, backin' up, cause my daddy taught me good
And I think maybe I should faint, but I don't, my daddy taught me good
I was down

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
God damn, I think you hate me, baby
I just want you to love me, I'm going crazy
God damn, I think you hate me, baby
I just want you to love me, I'm going crazy

[Verse: Laura Les]
I'm going 160 down the 405
On that Scion xB, I'm playing GTA V
Oh yeah, I'm full of shit, like I can't even fucking drive
I'm in the passenger seat dj'ing Spotify (You fucking liar!)
He said he likes the way I move, woah woah
Said he loves me too, woah woah
I hit a stupid dance move, woah woah
He lied and said I looked cool, woah woah

[Verse: Dylan Brady]
Big gas in the back, feel like shit, uh
What's that smell? It's a skunk, I like cash in the trunk
There's a note in the kitchen, yeah
It's okay, you never listen
Crash my car into the river
I don't think that I will miss her
Bending over backwards for you
Waiting for your ass to come through

[Outro: Dylan Brady]
God damn, I think you hate me, baby
I just want you to love me, I'm going crazy
God damn, I think you hate me, baby
I just want you to love me, I'm going crazy
(God damn, I think you hate me, baby)

[Joseph Simmons]
This speech is my recital, I think it's very vital
To rock a rhyme, that's right on time
It's Tricky is the title, here we go

[Ozzy Osbourne, Joseph Simmons]
Generals gathered in their masses
(Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's-)
Just like witches at black masses
(Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's-)
Evil minds that plot destruction
(Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's-)
Sorcerer of death's construction
(Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's-)
In the fields the bodies burning
(Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's-)
As the war machine keeps turning
(Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's-)
Death and hatred to mankind
(Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's-)
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh Lord, yeah
Oh Lord, yeah
Oh Lord, yeah

[Intro]
Madman drummers bummers
Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps
His way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older
I tripped the merry-go-round
With this very unpleasin', sneezin' and wheezin'
The calliope crashed to the ground

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady]
You- You- You- You- You feel me now? Let's just-
You- You- You can go and cry and let it out
I- I- I- I- just wanna fuck around
What do you think you're doing now?
I- I- I- I- do you understand me?
C- c-c-c- c-cash the check, start the week
Do you-, are you seeing, are you, are you thinking, do you-, are you
The calliope crashed to the ground
But she was blinded by the light

[Verse 2: Laura Les]
I don't wanna talk with my s-s-stutter
I can't start my day 'til I have a Monster
The whole internet has seen my tits
Fuck me, I just wish it was a better pic
I can't hold a tune, but I'm trying
Someday, I'll sing a song that's perfect
And you'll set it as your ringtone
At least this bullshit had a purpose
The calliope crashed to the ground
But she was blinded by the light

[Verse 3: Tony Velour]
Why you gotta feel that way?
I- I- I remember that it was not okay, now you've never been the same, yeah
I remember feeling all the pain, but I let it go away
You say you want more sunny days but you ain't never been able to stand the rain (you- yeah)
I- I- I'll fill my bag, is mine okay?
D- d- don't mean to brag but I can't hold my- my- my tongue
If that makes you feel better, I hope you can relax, I hear that shit is wack
I know you're mad, you see that you was wrong when you decided to believe in me but you was blinded by the light (The calliope crashed to the ground, but she was blinded by the light)

[Outro]
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night

[Verse 1: Jake]
If you got something to say, you should say it
I can't waste more time on your miscues
Tried to pretend like I saw it and called it
But I can't act like it doesn't bother me now

[Pre-Chorus: Jake]
As I'm leavin' your house
Dead on arrival

[Chorus: Jake & Nathan]
You took it to heart like an ashtray
I always forget what I'm trying to say
Asleep at the wheel like a drunk truck driver
Hung up to dry with the thief and the liar

[Post-Chorus: Jake]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Verse 2: Jake & Nathan]
Sorry I'm not well-equipped to quick to address it
Drama hits me like a quaalude
Sometimes I know what I want then I second-guess it
Sometimes I think I'm better off if I leave you

[Pre-Chorus: Jake]
Alone, so fucking hard being alone
What's good for you ain't always easy

[Chorus: Jake]
You took it to heart like an ashtray (Easy)
I always forget what I'm trying to say
Asleep at the wheel like a drunk truck driver
Hung up to dry with the thief and the liar

[Bridge: Jake]
I'm fine, I'm here like half of the time
That's nothin' new, it's a crime
And a crying shame

[Chorus: Jake with Nathan]
You took it to heart like an ashtray
I'm always fine but I'm never okay
You took it to heart like an ashtray
You took it to heart, you took it to heart
You took it to heart like an ashtray
I always mess up when I can't run away
Asleep at the wheel like a drunk truck driver
Hung up to dry with the thief and the liar

[Post-Chorus: Jake]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Verse 1: Jake]
Dead winter gonna take my life
Got a bad impression from some bad advice, it's a
Cold cut from a hard knock life
Bang-bang, cheep cheep, back it up, back it up now
Dead winter gonna take my life
Got a bad impression from some bad advice, it's a
Cold cut from a hard knock life
Bang-bang, cheap cheap, back it up, back it up now

[Verse 2: Jake]
Dead winter gonna snow me in
I got a bad thing going but I'm into it
I'll lick you up, lay you down
You're a sweet girl, like your...
It's a shitshow and I'm wearing the crown
Just call me Prince George and I'll go right down
Hard to speak with my tongue in your mouth
Bang-bang, cheep cheep, back it up, back it up

[Chorus: Jake]
Our strange divide
We're pulled in two directions
I'm not that guy
I'm barely keeping it together

[Bridge: Jake & Whistler]
Dead winter, gonna hang mе, hang me
Choked up, gotta open up gеt me through the
Dead winter, gonna hang me, hang me, hang me
Cold cut, looking bleak, fuck, try another
Dead winter, gonna hang me, hang me, hang me
Showed up with the construct feeling like a
Dead winter, gonna hang me, hang me, hang me
Big what, take a look at us getting tougher
Back it up, had enough, kick 'em off now

[Pre-Chorus: Jake]
Dead winter gonna take my life
Got a bad impression from some bad advice, it's a
Cold cut from a hard knock life
Bang-bang, cheep cheep, back it up, back it up

[Chorus: Jake & Whistler]
Our strange divide (Got a bad impression from some bad advice, it's a)
(Cold cut from my hard-knock life)
We're pulled in two directions (Bang-bang, cheap cheap, back it up, back it up now)
(Dead winter gonna take my life)
I'm not that guy (Got a bad impression on some bad advice, it's a)
(Cold cut from a hard-knock life)
I'm barely keeping it together (Bang-bang, cheep cheep, back it up, back it up now)

[Chorus: Jake]
Your closet smile, held like a knife
The sweetest thing, you're goddamn right
I'd stay awake for you to put me in the corner
You mess it up for me, we'll be history
You've got lips and I've got Listerine
But you can't wash the fucked up out of me tonight
(Despite how hard you try)

[Verse 1: Jake]
I feel your collar 'round my neck
You rest assured, that signal's read
I always have, I've always been your fucking dog
It seems I've learned a couple tricks
Been living like I'm losing it
And maybe silence is the weapon that you called for

[Chorus: Jake]
Your closet smile, held like a knife
The sweetest thing, you're goddamn right
I'd stay awake for you to put me in the corner
You mess it up for me, we'll be history
You've got lips and I've got Listerine
But you can't wash the fucked up out of me tonight
(Despite how hard you try)

[Verse 2: Jake]
I'll keep my mouth shut every night
Just gag me good and I'll treat you right
I'm your POW and the great deceiver
You better leave here when you go
I cannot place myself to know
Where you've been and what the hell I've been doing

[Chorus: Jake]
Your closet smile, held like a knife
The sweetest thing, you're goddamn right
I'd stay awake for you to put me in the corner
You mess it up for me, we'll be history
You've got lips and I've got Listerine
But you can't wash the fucked up out of me tonight
(Despite how hard you try)

[Outro: Jake & Nathan]
Despite how hard you try

Ding dong demolition delegate
A dexterous dream, the day goes by
Delirious darkness deep.....

That's a pretty little frame of mind

[Verse 1]
I get the top while I skeet off (Huh)
Swervin' through lanes, I am limitless
For the ones down, I say, "Free y'all"
I start to question what freedom is
My unc' put the Chevy on fours
I drip in all black like an emo bitch
But these are not regular clothes
These are the outfits I make a movie in (Huh)
Baby Keem count up them Frito Lays
I get the call and I go
Shawty gon' fuck all my goons, stop it
I am above the buffoons, stop it
I am above all the rules
Look at my wrist, it say "Freeze, freeze"
I need to buy a new neck, neck, neck, neck
I stopped wearin' VVs
(Huh, huh, huh)
Pleasе get the fuck out the pic' (Huh)
Hе got to fuck and he got to fuck
So what is the use of my dick?
She wanna put on my jewelry, and play with it
Like she's entitled to it
I'm done, bitch, go to your room

[Pre-Chorus]
I cannot fuck with no corny bitch
I give 'em ten and be done with it
I learned that shit from the gunners
Mask on, they don't know who it is
Eat the pussy so good
I give her butterflies all in her stomach, shit
I'm the youngest nigga runnin' it

[Chorus]
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Hooligans, they on the way
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Had to influence the wave
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Hop in the ship, go to space
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah
Drive to the crib on the lakes

[Verse 2]
I need another exit at the show
'Cause niggas be lurkin' when I hit the road, stupid
Y'all gotta deal with the boss
Y'all gotta talk to the ones in control, stupid
Even if I take a loss
I stand on the money so tall I see growth, stupid
Turn all you niggas to ghosts, stupid
Take your credit, now you're toast, stupid (Huh, huh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I cannot fuck with no corny bitch
I give 'em ten and be done with it
I learned that shit from the gunners
Mask on, they don't know who it is
Eat the pussy so good
I give her butterflies all in her stomach, shit
I'm the youngest nigga runnin' it

[Chorus]
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Hooligans, they on the way
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Had to influence the wave
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah-fah
Hop in the ship, go to space
Fah-fah-fah, fah-fah
Drive to the crib on the lakes

[Verse 1]
You a critic, boy, shut the fuck up
I'm a freak ho, hit her, dawg, and I'm in the cut
She on white, 'cause I energize her way too much
If we got up on a pic, ho, it's time to pick it up, up, up, up
And my neck King Tut, ah-ha-ha
I go up with the goons if I must, ah-ha-ha
And my bitch always catch a nut, ah-ha-ha
Double D's, but she throw the B's up, ah-ha-ha
Ayy, this that big road rage, this ain't one-way street
Time to flip the regime, welcome to the new me
She don't know when I land, but she know when I leave
This that raw and uncut, this that young Hykeem
Bitch, dressed in Vogue, she's a slim one, woah
Don't front, you was just where I livе, woah, woah
Ho, my cousin elevator in his crib, woah, woah
Ho, my baby pictures probably on his fridgе, woah, woah

[Chorus]
It's a lot of sponge around me
Lot of sons around me, real ones are drowning
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho
It's a lot of funds around me
Rap sons around me, get the fuck from 'round me
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho

[Verse 2]
They playin' right long, they ain't talkin' on the phone
We got Telfar bags, what's your taste level on?
Mine is pgLang, no, you didn't hear wrong
Ho, that bag thirteen-hundred, take your peachy ass home
Oh, you a sidekick, ho? Your Luigi ass on
Say he takin' care of you, he just cut the gas on
Okay, baby, get your money, hit me when you're back on
I'm jaded to the hustle, prove my critic ass wrong

[Chorus]
It's a lot of sponge around me
Lot of sons around me, real ones are drowning
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho
It's a lot of funds around me
Rap sons around me, get the fuck from 'round me
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho

[Verse 3]
Your last one told me that she 'bout to bounce back
I give her backstrokes, ew, now she mad
Oh, you really thought you had one? You ain't had to sweat one
Won the folks hearts, several million for my last one
Listen boys, listen up, listen quick
If your bitch ain't black, don't pose for the pic
Deep down we all know the hoes really hate that shit
Fuck that ordinary bitch, get you an insane bitch
I'm a philosopher, she a brain doctor
​pg headquarters, in the field playin' soccer
Heart of the team, number ten on my locker
Ayy, you niggas silly, boy, hot sauce on your—, boy
What you look like flyin' in? Stay your ass in null and void
Told myself these hoes ain't shit and niggas always makin' noise
Had to flip ten million with 'em, big investments with the (Woo)

[Chorus]
It's a lot of sponge around me
Lot of sons around me, real ones are drowning
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho
It's a lot of funds around me
Rap sons around me, get the fuck from 'round me
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho
I go enjoy my day
Done with being on display
In my truth, I'm what I am

Don't try get me hypnotised
Time's changing and so am I
With this ring, I choose my man

The next time you see my face
All the plastic will be erased
This is where I take some space, yeah
Good luck girl, I hope you see your fate

What's up ya'll
I ain't feeling so small
Make the world say stop
Original doll

She's standing so tall
No more hole in the wall
Go and live for yourself
Original Doll
How is self respect so wrong
Here is my chance to belong
When I laugh, I'm thinking back
I'm lucky and I'm glad
I can dance now in the sand
Whеn I cry, I'm real likе that

The next timе you see my face
All the plastic will be erased
But this is where I take some space, yeah
Good luck girl, I hope you see your fate

What's up ya'll
I ain't feeling so small
Make the world say stop

Interviewer: What do you feel when you hear a record like 2Pac's new one?
Kendrick: Pac's loud, man
Interviewer: Right, but don't you feel like that creates.. uh.. tension between East and West? He's talking about killing people; "I had sex with your wife"...
Kendrick: I talk about it, too. I talk about murder; I talk about violence; I talk about all of that. But, not to glorify it. To educate you on it; to know that it's real

(Kendrick talking over instrumental:)
Fifth-teen, um, le-let's go to thirteen
Hmm, walking from home
Police pull up on the side of you
"Ay, you look like so-and-so"
"I'm not so-and-so"
"You are so-and-so"
"Get in the car and let's take this ride"
"Get out the car; you're not so-and-so; we don't need you"
That's one of the stories
(Compton, California)
Compton, California for you

[Verse 1]
Every time we turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you
Public display of affection
Seems like no one else in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
We can get down like there's no one around
They keep on watching, we keep on rocking
Cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing
They keep watching
‘Cause like they’re probably saying

[Chorus]
Gimme, gimme more
Give me more
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme, gimme more
Gimme more

You got me in a crazy position
If you're on a mission
You’ve got my permission

[Pre-Chorus]
We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rocking, we keep on rocking
Oh, cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing
We keep rocking
They’re saying, we hear ‘em

Gimme, gimme more
Give me more

Red rag wrapped around the head like I work for Osama
My bitch pussy bald head look like Dalai Lama
Who got the percs? I need f-f-fifteen
My asian bitch rich and bold London Tipton
How the fuck cop knew that bro someone tipped him
Soon as we find out bet that we dip him
Heard that the opps got locked up we gon' bond him
Huh, we gon' find him, tie him up and grind him
These niggas dick suckin' what I thought I signed him
Would shine some light on him but it might blind him
Ayy, I need a 8th of wo'
Never leave the house I'm strapped boy you know I keep my pole
Chopstick on me and it sing like Nat King Cole
Nigga think he flеxin' money boy I seen mo'

I can say some smart shit make you feel dumb
If I beat your doonies down you gon' feel numb
I don't wanna buy that pint if it ain't sealed up
I'm finna put your bitch out I think I smelled somethin'
Niggas waitin' on they stimulus like "when the mail coming?"
Nigga you do not own shit like "when the bills coming?"
Damn, my battery's going dead got my scale jumpin'
Phone slappin' all day I got sales comin'
I was posed to be there at 11, it's like 12 somethin'
Why the fuck you flashin' 5 thousand, that ain't real money
You can't jugg me if I was blind I can feel money
I can't bring young dog around he'll steal somethin'
Draco with a banana clip I'll peel somethin'

Coach said shoot it from the 3 but I still dunked it

[Outro: YN Jay]

With some money green 1s, and a money green mink

Haters mad at the kid, I'd be mad too
I don't walk through the club, baby girl, I swag through
Got a hundred-thirty-thousand in this Louis bag, boo
Got a Ray Charles recipe, I'll make ya do, eat it too
Got a new trap house in the God damn hood
Yeah, the heat fucked up, but the stove works good
East Atlanta, Zone 6, thats my clique
Hood rich, so I put the Gucci print on my bricks
I ain't never had a job, I'm a God damn trapper
Trash can full of nothin' but empty brick rappers
Its a brick sendin' party, all the hustlers invited
But don't take no flicks, or you'll get indicted

[Chorus]

[Open Verse]

[Intro]
Oh, fucking gone right now
Fucking high right now
I'm gone
Morning to the evening
Complaints, oh
I'm gone, I'm gone
Listen, listen, oh

[Verse 1]
From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
And girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin' with our city like a sold out show
A house full of pros that specialize in the ho'in'
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work, oh
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work, mhm no

[Verse 2]
Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it—virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women

[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work, oh
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work, mhm no

[Verse 3]
She better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't she the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
She too damn raw, ain't no nigga that she holding
Ain't no nigga with the holding
Man, that love is too damn foreign

[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
Look at all that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Look at all that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work, oh
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work, mhm no

[Outro]
Money on the floor
I'm too damn high
Gone, gone, gone
High, you get high, you get high
You get high, you get high, you get high
You get high, you get high, you get high, no
Such a nuisance tryna kill all the loose ends
Tell me how the truth became so elusive
Them illusions from the fusion, the intrusion
Contusion, you got me confused, man
Wish I could change everything up
You all in my zone, Jack go home, ain't the same 'cause
Wonderin' if I was still the same girl (I wonder)
The girl you knew before she came up (I wonder)

What if I was you?
What if I was the same?
What about the truth?
Runnin' around with no shame

What if I wasn't Alicia? Would it please ya?
How would I feed ya?
What if to you, I was just a leecher
Why would I need ya?
Why would I need ya? Yeah

Tell me why the hell is somethin' always wrong
Tell me why the hell I had to write this song
Even when I'm right, they gonna say I'm wrong
Oh well, oh well
Tell me why the hell I had to write this song
Tell me why the hell there's somethin' always wrong
Even when I'm right, they gonna say I'm wrong
Oh well, oh well
Truth without love (Oh well, oh well)
Truth without love (Oh well, oh well, well)
Truth without love (Oh well, oh well, well)
Truth without love (Oh well, oh well, well)
Is just a lie

"You can't understand me" is an understatement
I love you more because I know you hate me
I love you more 'cause I know you forsake me
So you hate it more, can't wait to drive the stake in
You lucky I do this for different reasons
Shine all the time, no matter the seasons
Lawry's
Swear they out here extra salty
Man, they out here extra salty
Swear they out here extra salty, yeah

All in time, one day you'll find
The truth without love
Truth without love
The truth without love
Truth without love
Is just a lie

Oh well, oh well
Oh well, oh well
Truth without love (Oh well, oh well, well)
Truth without love (Oh well, oh well, well)
Truth without love (Oh well, oh well, well)
Truth without love (Oh well, oh well)
Is just a lie

[Verse 1]
We are lost and lonely people
And we're lookin’ for a reason and it's alright
So let's celebrate the dreamers
We embrace the space between us ’cause it's alright
We're all in this boat together
And we're sailin' toward the future and it's alright
We can't make the whole thing better
We're the authors of forever and it’s alright

[Chorus]
We arе on born on our own
And we die on our own
And we’rе here to make meanin'
Of what happens in between
We could hate, we could love
We could doubt, we could trust
But we’re here to make meanin'
For as long as we're breathin'
And it’s alright

[Post-Chorus]
Wherever you are, it's alright
Whoever you are, it's alright

[Bridge]
If you find love, it feels like it's the first time
God only knows it will be the last time
If you find love, it feels like it's the first time
God only knows it will be the last time

[Verse 2]
Where there's light, there must be a shadow
Cloudy skies and rain make a rainbow
We are builders, we are breakers
We are givers, we are takers and it's alright
We are seven billion stories
And we know the faith and glory and it's alright
Alright, oh

[Chorus]
We are on born on our own
And we die on our own
And we're here to make meanin'
Of what happens in between
We could hate, we could love
We could doubt, we could trust
But we're here to make meanin'
For as long as we're breathin'
And it's alright

[Post-Chorus]
Wherever you are, it's alright
Whoever you are, it's alright
Wherever you are, it's alright
Alright

[Outro]
If you find love, it feels like it's the first time
God only knows it will be the last time
If you find love, it feels like it's the first time
God only knows

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
Don't want your love
Don't worry who I'm seein' tonight
It's none of your business
Too bad I weren't enough
'Cause ready or not, I'm better on my own

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Too many times, you turned a blind eye to the way I feel
Oh, you're the reason why I'm numb
And when I try to give you my time, it's never, ever ideal
Had to learn it the hard way, oh yeah

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Wasted energy, yeah
Wasted energy
Wasted energy, yeah
Why did you, why did you fuck up the chemistry?

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
Brokеn promises along the way
Lost count of how many you made
My lovе, my love, my love
Tied up in your plans, still on center stage, no great escape
Wouldn't keep you, my line up, line up, line up, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Too many times, you turned a blind eye to the way I feel
Oh, you're the reason why I'm numb
And when I try to give you my time, it's never, ever ideal
Had to learn it the hard way, oh yeah

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Wasted energy, yeah
Wasted energy
Wasted energy
Why did you, why did you fuck up the chemistry?

[Outro: Diamond Platnumz]
Kwa nini penzi umelikata miguu
Unalibidua mara chini mara juu?
Why?
Why?
Moyo unaumia, Moyo unaumia
Moyo unaumia kwa nini unaugeuza nguo karaha?
Eti karaha, oh-oh

[Intro: Sampha]
You give me
You give me life

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
Three hour drive, I'm headin' nowhere
I've got the time now that you're not here
I keep travelin' by, travelin' by
Lookin' for love, you got me lookin' for love

[Bridge: Sampha]
Heart on my sleeve
No you, no me
It's more than I can take
Down on my knees
Come back to me
It's more than I can take
Heart on my sleeve
No you, no me
It's more than I can take
Down on my knees, my love
It's more than I can take

[Outro: Sampha]
You give me
You give me life
You give me

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
Yeah, well
I never thought I'd find it
But it's always been clear
All this time that I've been tryin'
You were standin' right here
I never thought I'd go far
And all this time I've been fightin'
'Cause everything was so hard
You didn't give up on me, baby, no

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I know you got me
There's nothin' like your love
You know I got you

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
And if I could stay, I'll stay here forever
And if I could be here, we'll be here together
'Cause did you know that you save me?
Did you know that you save me from the fall?
Did you know that you save me?
'Cause we've been through it all
And I owe it all to you, I owe it all
I owe it all to you, I owe you all

[Post-Chorus: Alicia Keys & Snoh Aalegra]
I know that you rock with me
You know I'll be rockin' with you
Know that you rock with me
You know I'll be rockin' with you

[Verse 2: Snoh Aalegra]
Needed to be reminded
'Cause it wasn't all clear
No reason to be hidin'
'Cause you're standin' right here
I just wanna go far
All this time I've been fightin'
'Cause everything is so hard
But you won't give up on me, hey, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
I know you got me
And there's nothin' like your love
You know I got you

[Chorus: Snoh Aalegra]
And if I could stay, I'll stay here forever
And if I could be here, we'll be here together
'Cause did you know that you save me?
Did you know that you save me from the fall?
Did you know that you save me?
'Cause we've been through it all
And I owe it all to you, I owe it all
And I owe it all to you, I owe you all

[Post-Chorus: Alicia Keys & Snoh Aalegra]
I know that you rock with me
You know I'll be rockin' with you
Know that you rock with me
You know I'll be rockin' with you
I know that you rock with me
You know I'll be rockin' with you
Know that you rock with me
You know I'll be rockin' with you

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Kiss on me, kiss on me
Kiss on me in the daytime
In front of the whole show
So they can all know
I want you to love on me, love on me
Love on me in the daytime
Like you do at bedtime
So they can all know

'Cause the world needs love
Don't we all know?

[Interlude: Jill Scott]
Ooh, when you are righteously loving somebody
And that somebody is righteously loving you too
It's a vibration
That everybody everywhere
Can't help but receive
It's entrancing
It's a goodness
Luminousness
Victorious energy
Come on, let's let 'em see

[Chorus 2: Alicia Keys]
I want you to kiss on me, kiss on me
Kiss on me in the daytime
In front of the whole show

'Cause the world needs love
Don't we all know?
So come on and love on me, love on me
Love on me in the daytime
Like you do at bedtime
So they can all know

[Verse 1]
Galvanising uncertainty
Mindful of the weary inkling that is lurking
Hierarchy, it's been cracking aegis
Embodied in this black heart shameless

[Chorus]
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Like a blunder brewing full to the brim
I can see the Beelzebub Cheshire grin

[Post-Chorus]
Cooking something raw
Cooking something big
Pandemonium
Selfish pigs
Headless chickens
Scared shitless
The media
Will never quit

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Allegro fueled with discontent
Mortal traffic lights signalling when to stay or go
Condescending expеndables botched to a clock
Novice to thе dilemma with nothing clever left in stock

[Chorus]
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Like a blunder brewing full to the brim
I can hear Hell's kitchen and they're singing hymns

[Post-Chorus]
Cooking something raw
Cooking something big
Pandemonium
Selfish pigs
Headless chickens
Scared shitless
The media
Will never quit

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
The affluent with a bad omen hanging
Monstrosity scarce breaking freedom
Shrewd and not in the mood to disillude
We are the pillars of a forgotten pier

[Chorus]
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
(Is it all?) Is it all straws in the wind?
(Is it all?) Is it all straws in the wind?
(Is it all?) Is it all straws in the wind?
(Is it all?) Is it all straws in the wind?

[Chorus]
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Like a slumber and we've all just awoken
I can see the Beelzebub Cheshire grin

[Outro]
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?

[Intro]
Ohh, ohh, ohh-ohh
Ahh, ohh-ohh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
I think this is my last chance
My last chance
My last chance
My last chance with you

[Verse 1]
Hey, baby
May I have this dance?
I've been waiting all night
For the song to be right
Now they've turned down the lights

[Verse 2]
Hey, darling
May I have this dance?
Oh, baby
And there's how you feel
My love is real
For you

[Chorus]
I think this is my last chance
My last chance
My last chance
My last chance

[Verse 3]
Hey, baby
Dance with me
And maybe you'll see
What I feel is really real
For you

[Verse 4]
Hey, baby
May I have this dance?
This is my last chance
To get close to you
If you only knew
What I've been going through

[Verse 5]
Oh, baby
I'm just a shy guy
I'm so nervous
Girl, but I got to try

[Bridge]
Girl, please, takе my hand
Dance with me, baby
Pleasе dance real close to me

[Chorus]
I think this is my last chance
My last chance
My last chance
My last chance

[Outro]
My last chance
Oh, let's go home
Oh, baby, baby
Ooh
Ooh ooh
Oooh ooh
Oooh

[Verse 1]
Baby love
Don't know why, don't know why I can't give you up
Maybe 'cuz when it comes to love
I can't get enough, I can't enough of you, of you
Midnights, I compromise I tap into the dark side
I need you to satisfy my appetite
And I'm taking bites of you, of you

[Chorus]
We wake up hungover and we fight all day
We get drunk at night and the bottles break
Baby, ooh-ooh-ooh, we're only good when we're naked, naked
It's a thin white line between love and hate
When I hear your name, yeah, my body shakes
Baby, ooh-ooh-ooh, we'rе only good when we're nakеd

[Verse 2]
Baby love
I feel it when you come again, that Midas touch
It's golden, I'm rolling and I lick the dutch
Can't get too much of you, of you

[Chorus]
We wake up hungover and we fight all day
We get drunk at night and the bottles break
Baby, ooh-ooh-ooh, we're only good when we're naked, naked
It's a thin white line between love and hate
When I hear your name, yeah, my body shakes
Baby, ooh-ooh-ooh, we're only good when we're naked

[Outro]
I can't help it
I'm burning up inside
I can't wait 'til you get on my body, yeah
I can't help it
I'm burning up inside
I can't wait 'til you get on my body, yeah
I can't help it
I'm burning up inside
I can't wait 'til you get on my body, yeah
I can't help it
I'm burning up inside
I can't wait 'til you get on my body, yeah
I can't help it
I'm burning up inside
I can't wait 'til you get on my body, yeah
I can't help it
I'm burning up inside
I can't wait 'til you get on my body, yeah

[Intro: Robert G Moore Jr.]
Nah, I got one more thing and I'm just about done

[Chorus: Kanye West & Robert G Moore Jr.]
This is the glory (This is the glory)
This is the victory (Hah)
This is a majesty (This is a majesty)
Y'all pay the tapestry (Hah)
Y'all know they misery (Y'all know they misery)
I know the energy (I know the energy)
And I know the strategy (Hah)
Stay cool (Amazing), start up a new label, follow Jesus

[Interlude: Robert G Moore Jr. & Kanye West]
Some of y'all still ain't got it, got it, got it
Who God is to you, you, you (Yes, sir)
We have no pressure
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's the journey goin' forward
Everybody wanna look for comfort
Everybody want comfort and joy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't that sound like a message?
You had to run your feelings- (Got it)
Lyrics from Snippet 2

[Kanye West]
Sacrifice, drop out school to 

[?], if you gun him down
Always ungrateful vibes, bringing out my other side
Look into my eyes, you don't see the love inside?

Lyrics from Snippet 3

[Verse: Dr. Dre]
No word and that's word to the mics
How many sins do you think that I committed?
Say, me say many, money, say, me say many, many, many
How many times do you think I've been neglected?

[Verse 1]
Sit around until I find something better to spend my time
But nothing's appealin'
Nothing really lasts that long for me to realize, I'm still alone
And you're not with me
I wonder what's inside your mind, but you seem pretty occupied
So I'll leave it alone
If only I could do the same, share your ways, and I'll change the name
And make it my own

[Chorus]
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?

[Verse 2]
I tried to eat, I tried to sleep, but everything seems boring to me
I don't know what to do
Got two friends that I could see, but they got two jobs and a baby
I just wanna see you
Dependin' on our time apart, thе better the distractions arе
And there isn't a lot
Only took a couple times without you here to realize
But I figured it out

[Chorus]
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?
Will you? Will you? Will you? Will you?
Will you? Will you be with me?

Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
Sittin' back blowin' off pressure (Woo), it's crazy how things come together
She sayin' that I do it way better, oh lord
She sayin' that I do it way better

[Verse]
... and they be showin' love
Figured out that gettin' stoned isn't bad as they said when we was growin' up

[Chorus]
Sittin' back blowin' off pressure (Woo), it's crazy how things come together
She sayin' that I do it way better, oh lord
She sayin' that I do it way better

[Intro]
Shit (oh yeah, oh yeah)
You know it, don't give me shit when I'm (yeah, yeah)
(Tell me why)
Tell me why, tell me why
It's so hard to say goodbye, shit
Tell me why, tell me why
(No, no, no, no) yeah
Oh shit, let's go (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, shit
And when I get inside of my mind, I lose my time
Thinking 'bout the times we had, thinking 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left whеn you told me this was forever and
Tеll me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, shit

[Verse 1]
Lost too many people to this shit, can't even speak upon this shit
I seen shit, I'm way too damn young, it shouldn't need to be like this
I swear that I'm way too damn numb to even think about this shit
But when it's late and I lay awake, I get to tweakin' in this bitch
Overthinkin', overdrinkin' Hennessy up in this bitch
And I'ma face another 'Wood 'til I can't think up in this bitch
'Cause if I keep thinking 'bout our memories
Then it's gon' be in memory of me

[Hook]
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, shit
And when I get inside of my mind I lose my time
Thinking 'bout the times we had, thinking 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, shit

[Verse 2]
I can't count all the tears I cried, so many sleepless nights
Watched all of my idols die, right in front of my eyes
She asked why my heart so cold, and I just can't even lie
I think that I'm better off without you with me tonight
Better off alone, 'cause I won't take it well if
You come in my life just to go like the rest did
Why the fuck does God keep testing me?
Put my mind to bed, let it rest in peace

[Chorus]
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, shit
And when I get inside of my mind I lose my time
Thinking 'bout the times we had, thinking 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, shit
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, shit
And when I get inside of my mind I lose my time
Thinking 'bout the times we had, thinking 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, shit

Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (Smile)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (Smile)

[Verse 1]
Every day, Groundhog Day
Goin' through motions felt so fake
Not myself, not my best
Felt like I failed the test

[Pre-Chorus]
But every tear has been a lesson
Rejection can be God's protection
Long hard road to get that redemption
But no shortcuts to a blessin'

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (Smile)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shinе from a mile
Finally got back that smile (Smile)

[Verse 2]
I'm 2.0, rеmodeled
Used to be dull, now I sparkle
Had a piece of humble pie
That ego check saved my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I got a smile like Lionel Richie
Big and bright, need shades just to see me
Tryna stay alive just like I'm the Bee Gees (Oh, woah)
A Mona Lisa masterpiece (Now I'm)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (C'mon, smile, woo)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful (So grateful)
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (Smile, oh, oh)

[Chorus]

Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (Woo, smile)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (Smile, oh, oh)

[Outro]
I'm so thankful
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally
Smile (Oh)
I'm so grateful
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally
Smile (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile

Ooh!

[Verse 1]
Some girls, they like candy
And others, they like to grind
I'll settle for the back of your hand
Somewhere on my behind
Treat me like I'm a bad girl
Even when I'm being good to you
I don't want you to thank me
You can just, ooh!

[Verse 2]
Some guys like to sweet talk
And others, they like to tease
Tie my hands behind my back and
Ooh, I'm in ecstasy
Don't slobber me with kisses

You better

[Verse 1]
An ancient business, a modern piece of glasswork
Down on the corner that you walk each day in passing
The elderly sales clerk won't eye us with suspicion
The whole immortal corporation's given its permission

[Verse 2]
A little stairway, a little piece of carpet
A pair of mirrors that are facing one another
Out in both directions, a thousand little Julias
That come together in the middle of Manhattan

[Pre-Chorus]
You waited since lunch
It all comes at once

[Chorus]
Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 3]
Around the corner, the house that modеrn art built
A house for modern art to keep it out the closеts
The people who might own it, the sins of pride and envy
And on the second floor, the Richard Serra Skate Park

[Pre-Chorus]
You waited since lunch
It all comes at once

[Chorus]
Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 4]
Sit on the park wall, ask all the right questions
"Why are the horses racing taxis in the winter?"
Look up at the buildings, imagine who might live there
Imagining your Wolfords in a ball upon the sink there

[Pre-Chorus]
You waited since lunch
It all comes at once

[Chorus]
Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Spoken]
Thank you, Miami!

[Verse 1]
Tough choice? Don't make me laugh
My life's a joke, your life's a gas
You broke my heart at midnight mass
Now I'm the ghost of Christmas past
The only choice you gave to me
Is one I took reluctantly
'Cause when we play democracy
You always take immunity

[Chorus]
How long 'til we sink to the bottom of the sea?
How long, how long?
How long 'til we sink and it's only you and me?
How long, how long?

[Post-Chorus]
How long? (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la)

[Verse 2]
What's the point of getting clean?
You'll wear the same old dirty jeans
What's the point of being seen?
Those eyes are cruel, those eyes are mean
What's the point of human beings?
A Sharpie face on tangerines
Why's it felt like Halloween since Christmas 2017?

[Chorus]
How long?
How long, how long?
How long 'til we sink and it's only you and me?
How long, how long?

[Post-Chorus]
How long? (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la)

[Verse 3]
Getting to the top
Wasn't supposed to be this hard
The house is on Mulholland Drive
The car's on Sunset Boulevard
The registration's here with me
Neither of us has the key
We can live down in the flats
The hills will fall eventually

[Chorus]
How long 'til we sink to the bottom of the sea?
How long, how long?
How long 'til we sink and it's only you and me?
How long, how long?

[Post-Chorus]
How long? (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la)

[Verse 1]
Sunflower in the morning
Standing in the garden
All before you wake
No power can compel you
Out into the daylight
Let that evil wait

[Chorus]
Strange thought upon the pillow
"What day demands a date?"
Well, I don't know

[Verse 2]
Sunflower in the evening
Standing in the garden
Taking up that space
No power can compel me
Back into the daylight
Let that evil wait

[Chorus]
Strange thought upon the pillow
"What day demands a date?"
Well, I don't know

[Outro]
You know, ooh
Ooh-way-ooh

[Spoken]

[Ezra Koenig]
Thank you very much
Who had the sign there? Is that you?
You have the sign there?

Had to double check what it said
It says, "Hey, I---I can play A-Punk"?
Alright! You wanna---

[Verse 1]
Johanna drove slowly into the city
The Hudson River all filled with snow
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger
Oh, oh, oh
A thousand years in one piece of silver
She took it from his lily-white hand
Showed no fear, she'd seen the thing
In the young men's wing at Sloan-Kettering

[Spoken]
And now we just bounce around

[Chorus]
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey, 'ey!
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey!

[Verse 2]
His Honor drove southward, seeking exotica
Down to the pueblo huts of New Mexico
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas
Oh, oh, oh
I saw Johanna down in the subway
She took an apartment in Washington Heights
Half of the ring lies here with me
But the other half's at the bottom of the sea

[Chorus]
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"

[Outro]
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey, 'ey!
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey, 'ey!

[Spoken]
Alright, make some noise!
Nick from Orlando!

[Verse 1]
I want to be wild and young
And not be afraid to lose
Cry on my own, me and my bottle
These are the things I choose

[Chorus]
But they're watching me, judging me
Making me feel so used
Can't you see that all I wanna do
Is get a little wild, get a little high
Kiss a hundred boys and not feel like I'm tied to them
If you wanna judge me, then go and load the gun
I've done nothing wrong, I'm young

[Verse 2]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I wanna fight and fall off the tables
Then wait to regret last night
My heavy heart pounds deep like a dagger
'Cause I'm not afraid to bite

[Chorus]
But they'rе watching me, judging me
Making me feel so usеd
Can't you see that all I wanna do
Is get a little wild, get a little high
Kiss a hundred boys and not feel like I'm tied to them
If you wanna judge me, then go and load the gun
I've done nothing wrong, I'm young

Get a little wild, get a little high
Kiss a hundred boys and not feel like I'm tied to them

[Chorus]
Oh, congratulations
You found the one, you found the one
I think I can finally face that
I'm not the one, never was the one
God, I dodged a bullet
I ran fast right through it
I love myself too much to fight you
But, oh, congratulations
You found the one, another one
You found the one, another one
You found the one, another one

[Verse]
Honestly, I'm happy for you
I do not wish you no harm
I met your boyfriend, he's beautiful
Please treat him like he's someone
Someone perfect, someone so divine
Someone special, someone good inside
I don't want him to hurt like me
Just please treat him like he's someone

[Chorus]
But, oh, congratulations
You found the one, you found the one
I think I can finally face that
I'm not the one, never was the one
God, I dodged a bullet

I love myself too much to fight you
But, oh, congratulations
You found the one, another one

Move through him like water
Love stains on the sun
Don't say I didn't warn ya
You'll never be enough
Move through him like water
Love stains on the sun
Don't say I didn't warn ya
You'll never be enough

[Chorus]
But, oh, congratulations
You found the one, you found the one
I think I can finally face that
I'm not the one, never was the one
God, I dodged a bullet
I ran fast right through it
I love myself too much to fight you
But, oh, congratulations
You found the one, another one

[Verse 1]
Put your hands in the air if you sometimes ever get sad like me
Put your fingers on your chest and your body and breathe, let it be
Don't find it hard to say so
I'll say it, "I get lonely"
Put your hands in the air if you sometimes ever get sad like me

[Pre-Chorus]
Sad like me, wait patiently
And you're gonna be free
Wait patiently

[Chorus]
I get so serious sometimes
My emotions sittin' on a wire
And I gotta be out my mind
'Cause the second that I'm happy and I'm fine
Suddenly there's violins and movie scenes
And cryin' rivers in the streets
And, God, I don't know why I get so serious sometimes
(So serious) So serious sometimes

[Verse 2]
I remember last summer in the city
Makin' plans and you felt like mine
Look at me and I felt so Hollywood
But, baby, then you changed your mind
I got so fuckin' close to feelin' so good, so satisfied
I remember last summer in the city
Makin' plans and you felt like mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Felt like mine, then I froze in time
You changed your mind
And I'll never know why

[Chorus]
I get so serious sometimes
My emotions sittin' on a wire
And I gotta be out my mind
'Cause the second that I'm happy and I'm fine
Suddenly there's violins and movie scenes
And cryin' rivers in the streets
And, God, I don't know why I get so serious

[Bridge]
I get so, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Outro]
Violins and movie scenes
And cryin' rivers in the streets
And, God, I don't know why I get so serious sometimes
(So serious, so serious) Sometimes
So serious sometimes

[Verse 1]
Think about your lips and the way they kiss
There's so much I really miss about you
Sitting on the beach, you were still in reach
And I haven't felt free without you

[Pre-Chorus]
All of the memories feel like magic
All of the fighting seems so sweet
All that we were, my love, was tragic
And you're the last thing that I need

[Chorus]
So I lay a dozen roses
For the lover that I've lost
I stand by all my choices
Even though I paid the cost
Oh, all those nights, the lows and highs
I share them all with you
So I lay a dozen roses
I lay them there, I lay them there for you, mmm

[Verse 2]
You've been on my mind every single night
I can't visualize life without you
I've been tryin' to go a week without losing sleep
But there's something that I need to go through

[Pre-Chorus]
All of the memories feel like magic
All of the fighting seems so sweet
All that we were, my love, was tragic
And you're the last thing that I need

[Chorus]
So I lay a dozen roses
For the lover that I've lost
I stand by all my choices
Even though I paid the cost
All those nights, the lows and highs
I share them all with you
So I lay a dozen roses
I lay them there, I lay them there for you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
So I lay a dozen roses
For the lover that I've lost
I stand by all my choices
Even though I paid the cost
All those nights, the lows and highs
I share them all with you
So I lay a dozen roses
I lay them there, I lay them there for you

[Verse 1]
You went cold, you got caught
You exceeded my darkest thoughts
A poisoned chalice, thorn in my side
I'm so numb from your lies

[Chorus]
While you were busy breakin' hearts
I was busy breakin'
I was giving all my love
You were busy takin'
Summer haze of summer wine
Reminded me of better times
But I let you in my heart
So, now it's busy breakin' (Ooh)
Now it's busy breakin', oh (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
Went so far down this road
I felt depression deep in my soul
Drug-fuelled fights, ride your lows and highs
We played it all out 'til we died

[Chorus]
Whilе you were busy breakin' hеarts
I was busy breakin'
I was giving all my love
You were busy takin'
Summer haze of summer wine
Reminded me of better times
But I let you in my heart
So, now it's busy breakin' (Ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
While you were busy breakin' hearts
I was busy breakin'
I was giving all my love
You were busy takin'
Summer haze of summer wine
Reminded me of better times
But I let you in my heart
But I let you in my heart
Why'd I let you in my heart?
'Cause now it's busy breakin'

[Verse 1]
Can't believe I still avoid the East Side
Even though I know that you don't live there now
Lately you're the only thing on my mind
And I can't stop myself from drivin' by your house

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, every time I hear our song it kind of hurts me still
And, ooh, even after all this time, I kinda miss you still
I'm wondering

[Chorus]
Do you even think about it?
The way that we changed the world
And don't it make you sad
That we'll never be kids again?
No, we'll never be kids again
Tell me how you live without it
Did somеbody change your world
And now you don't look back?
'Cause we'll nеver be kids again
No, we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever

[Verse 2]
Livin' out of suitcases in hotels
Drinking way too much and talking through the night
Really wish I didn't know you so well
Wouldn't be so hard to leave the past behind

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, every time I hear our song it kind of hurts me still
And, ooh, even after all this time, I kinda miss you still
I'm wondering

[Chorus]
Do you even think about it?
The way that we changed the world
And don't it make you sad
That we'll never be kids again?
No, we'll never be kids again
Tell me how you live without it
Did somebody change your world
And now you don't look back?
'Cause we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever

[Bridge]
Mmm, mmm
No, I, I, I, I
I'm, I'm
Mmm, mmm

[Chorus]
Do you even think about it?
The way that we changed the world
And don't it make you sad
That we'll never be kids again?
No, we'll never be kids again
Tell me how you live without it
Did somebody change your world
And now you don't look back
'Cause we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever

[Intro]
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance

[Verse 1]
Thought I buried you and I
But I have diamonds in my eyes
Such a bitter tear to cry
You're still ruining my life
I'm not over it, I'm not over it
I remember every taste
If I get a little wasted, I can almost see your face
Such a dark and lonely place
I'm not over it
Someone get me over it

[Pre-Chorus]
And come find me
Wrap your arms around me, baby
They say you can't fall out of love 'til you love someone else
Where you been hiding?
When my heart's been slowly breaking
They say you can't fall out of love 'til you love someone else
'Til then

[Chorus]
Guess I'll dance (Dance, dance, dance, dance)
Guess I'll dance (Dance, dance, dance, dance)
'Til then
Guess I'll dance (Dance, dance, dance, dance)
Guess I'll, guess I'll dance (Dance, dance, dance, dance)

[Verse 2]
Can't forget the way you move me
Try and drown you in the music
Hold my breath and close my eyes
Gotta drag you out my mind
Still not over it (Over it, no)
Someone get me over it

[Pre-Chorus]
And come find me (Oh)
Wrap your arms around me, baby
They say you can't fall out of love 'til you love someone else (Oh)
Where you been hiding?
When my heart's been slowly breaking
They say you can't fall out of love 'til you love someone else
'Til then

[Chorus]
Guess I'll dance (Dance, dance, dance, dance) (Dance)
Guess I'll dance (Dance, dance, dance, dance)
'Til then
Guess I'll dance (Dance, dance, dance, dance)
Guess I'll, guess I'll dance (Dance, dance, dance, dance)

[Bridge]
I've never been this low
Feel so out of control
Throw down a miracle
Sip on your holy ghost
I've never felt this low
Cry like an animal
Sadness is beautiful

[Pre-Chorus]
So come find me
Wrap your arms around me, baby (Oh)
They say you can't fall out of love
They say you can't fall out of love
Where you been hiding? (Oh, no no)
When my heart's been slowly breaking
They say you can't fall out of love 'til you love someone else
(Whoa, oh)

[Chorus]
Guess I'll dance (Dance, dance, dance, dance)
Guess I'll dance (Dance, dance, dance, dance)
They say you can't fall out of love 'til you love someone else (Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance)

[Verse 1]
Do you think of me
When you're in California alone?
It's a lonely place at the best of times, Lord knows
I won't lie to you
I could have given you more
But life got fast
Good things don't last anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Now and then you cross my mind
It takes me back to a sweeter time
But I let it go
I let you go

[Chorus]
'Til I wake up in the morning, you're all that I see
You run through my head, in and out of my dreams
Breathe for a minute, try and focus on me
But I can't think of anyone else
Now my heart is broken and I'm crying on the floor
And every part of me hopes you walk through the door
But you'rе not here, baby
And I can't love anyonе else
'Til I forgive myself

[Verse 2]
Did you lie to me⁠
When you said I was all that you need⁠?
Guess we'll never know all the beautiful things we could be

[Pre-Chorus]
Now and then you cross my mind
It takes me back to a sweeter time
But I let it go
I let you go

[Chorus]
'Til I wake up in the morning, you're all that I see
You run through my head, in and out of my dreams
Breathe for a minute, try and focus on me
But I can't think of anyone else
Now my heart is broken and I'm crying on the floor
And every part of me hopes you walk through the door
But you're not here, baby
And I can't love anyone else
'Til I forgive myself, ooh
'Til I forgive myself, ooh
'Til I wake up in the morning, you're all that I see
You run through my head, in and out of my dreams
Breathe for a minute, try and focus on me
But I can't think of anyone else
Now my heart is broken and I'm crying on the floor
And every part of me hopes you walk through the door
But you're not here, baby
And I can't love anyone else
'Til I forgive myself

[Verse 1]
I think you finally lost your mind
You went the wrong direction
It's blurred your whole perception
'Cause you're not there
Even though you say you are
You keep leaning on the stars
But they don't know who you are

[Pre-Chorus]
You say you're doing fine, it's just a phase
You just get high to numb the pain
You're lying, your eyes are not the same
It's hard to say goodbye

[Chorus]
Please come back when you're sober
'Cause I've done everything, everything I can do
I gotta draw the line, you're on your own this time
After everything, everything we've been through
I can't do this for you

[Verse 2]
You're like a car running through red lights
You've had so many warnings
Can't you see your world's about to crash down
And spin around, like satellites lost to the night? (To the night)

[Pre-Chorus]
You say you're doing fine, it's just a phase
You just get high to numb the pain
You're flying, you are not the same
You told your final lie

[Chorus]
Please come back when you're sober
'Cause I've done everything, everything I can do
I gotta draw the line, you're on your own this time
After everything, everything we've been through
I can't do this for you (This for you)

[Bridge]
Go, go, go, go
Just go, go, go, go

[Chorus]
Please come back when you're sober
'Cause I've done everything, everything I can do
I gotta draw the line, you're on your own this time
After everything, everything we've been through
I can't do this for you

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Okay

[Verse 1]
We made love in every room, we would stay in bed for hours
I would wear your favourite shirt 'cause it smelt like you
You would write me little notes, leave them on the kitchen counter
Now I read them in a dark, dark room when I'm feeling super blue

[Pre-Chorus]
I think about you every day, it cuts me like a knife
I see your ghost on roads we used to drive

[Chorus]
So I left my love in Laurel Canyon
'Cause therе's nothing left of me and you
I used to lovе those hills
Now the house we built is just an empty mansion in Laurel Canyon
It's just an empty mansion in Laurel Canyon

[Verse 2]
Used to talk of having kids over breakfast on a Sunday
You would tell me all your dreams for a wedding in the spring, oh
I know I'm gonna find all of that with someone else one day
And when I do, I won't have to prove I love 'em with a ring

[Pre-Chorus]
I think about you every day, it cuts me like a knife
I see your ghost on roads we used to drive

[Chorus]
So I left my love in Laurel Canyon
'Cause there's nothing left of me and you
I used to love those hills
Now the house we built is just an empty mansion in Laurel Canyon
It's just an empty mansion, oh

[Bridge]
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) I've gotta get away
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) The ocean and the waves
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) I've gotta get away
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Chorus]
So I left my love in Laurel Canyon
'Cause there's nothing left of me and you
I used to love those hills
Now the house we built is just an empty mansion in Laurel Canyon
It breaks my heart to mention Laurel Canyon
It's just an empty mansion in Laurel Canyon

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa & James Corden]
What a year for dating, crazy
Nothin' is the way it was
People textin' exes sex pics
From the basement at their mom's

[Refrain: Dua Lipa & Both]
If you have human contact
Don't know what you'll contract
So your first date's always on Zoom (Oh)
You just wish you could just go out
Get a little naughty
Girl, you're drunk on FaceTime
WiFi's gettin' sloppy

[Verse 2: James Corden & Dua Lipa]
There's no bars, there's no school
Poundin' Claws in a kitty pool
Thirsty slides through DMs
Now you landed in their close friend's

[Verse 3: Dua Lipa & James Corden]
No matter how you try to break through
It all feels like a waste of time
When you've gotten your face off Netflix
Hulu, HBO, and Prime

[Refrain: Dua Lipa & James Corden]
Now you're lookin' ready
Though, it's low-key scary
Check your drip and grab your Lysol (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa & James Corden]
If you're ever wanna see another person's body
If you zap on your forehead, you're a total hottie

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & James Corden]
Wear a mask, wash your hands
It's not like you have other plans
It's awkward, but it's cool
Following all these COVID rules (COVID rules)

[Bridge: Dua Lipa, James Corden & Both]
One: Get in the zone, no more doing edibles at home alone
Two: Stalk their Instagram
Gotta background check if you wanna slam
Three: Up your waxin' game
No one's seen you naked since February
And if you hit it off, watch out if they start to cough
I got new rules for dating
Six feet apart, no mating
Masks can be irritating
No more procrastinating
These are the rules for dating
One: There's a new third base, that's when you get to see their lower face
Two:  Right before you touch, Purell until your hands get rough
Three: Just seal the deal, you better hope you lick 'em when you wake up in the morning
You're feelin' numb, it's you, your hand, and OnlyFans

[Outro: James Corden & Dua Lipa]
We've got rules for dating
Safety is stimulating
It's your neighbors you're saving
You'll get that touch you're craving
Just follow these rules for dating

[Verse 1]
Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go straight to hell
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust mе
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Verse 2]
Bеtty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go straight to hell
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Bridge]
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said "James, get in, let's drive"
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long

[Verse 3]
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

[Chorus]
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Outro]
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you

[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
Got the island feelin' full of life (Uh)
I got everyone here (I got everyone here)
Got my eyes set on a bigger prize (Uh)
Work is never done here (Work is never done, no)
So help me God, I refuse to lose, I'd rather burn to death
That's why I brought you here, baby
'Cause them bells ain't gonna earn themselves
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Bells ain't gonna earn themselves
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Them bells ain't gonna earn themselves
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Bells ain't gonna earn themselves
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse]
Yeah, look
Fences for sale, like I lay down bars (But I'm not rapper)
Got the homie Leaf buyin' weed in the yard (But I'm not a trapper)
Fire mixtape, if K.K. slide me a slapper in
Then I'm able to get these sisters to make you look hella dapper (Hella dapper)
Don't Animal Cross me (No), that'll get you wasted
You just paid off the loan, don't get buried under that basement (Woah)
Don't hold my money, just trust me, I need duckets (Yeah)
Keep playin' with me, I'll have you swimmin' with sea-pluses (Woo, woo)
Meet my new assistant (Uh)
A Southern belle (Yeah), she old school (Woo)
She run them numbers well (Yeah)
Check with her, cause if my islanders are underwhelmed
Nobody will be here to see you makin' another fail (Woo)
What else? Oh yeah, this your permanent job
Not sayin' you work for the mob, but you work for the mob
So here's your shovel, here's your axe, here's your net
I need money on the double, I don't ask for respect, yeah (That's what's up, boy)

[Chorus]
Got the island feelin' full of life (Uh)
I got everyone here (I got everyone here)
Got my eyes set on a bigger prize (Uh)
Work is never done here (Work is never done, no)
So help me God, I refuse to lose, I'd rather burn to death
That's why I brought you here, baby
'Cause them bells ain't gonna earn themselves
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Bells ain't gonna earn themselves
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Them bells ain't gonna earn themselves
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Bells ain't gonna earn themselves
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Like I said baby
If you go astray
Well then, go on
Go your sweet way
I thought you knew by now
You do just as you please

[Chorus]
And here's to the next time
And here's to the next time

[Verse 2]
How many times
Have you gone before?
And how many times
Have I forgiven you once more?
You never had to wait
Just like I waited for you

[Chorus]
And here's to the next time
Here's to the next time

[Bridge]
When you're gonе
The time drags by
I wish you'd learn
Not to makе me cry
To make me cry

[Verse 3]
So, if you're gonna leave me
Never to come back
Break it to me gently
Or my world will crack
So, be sure to let me know
That I'll never will say

[Chorus]
Here's to the next time
Here's to the next time
Here's to the next time
Here's to the next time
Here's to the next time
Look up in the sky
There's a speck that's flying by
Red lights and I don't know why
Seems that I spend most of my time
Watching the planes go by

The windows open, the curtains blow
Round my room where the lights are low
I stand in darkness and watch the stars
Wondering just how far you are from me

I'm out here
You're somewhere
Somewhere out there
Too far from me

And I want it to be
Like it was when the summer was here
Instead of just sitting here
Watching the planes go by
The street lamp look lonely
I wonder, I wonder if it feels like me
With no one to love him
And no one to talk to
When she's out there moving
Without thinking 'bout me

Come back, baby, come back
Let me pray that one day
That those planes in the sky
Will be bringing you back home to me
Back to me
Oh, I feed you back home with me
Get the fuck outside

This is the news
One, two, three, four

The grass in Ashfield Park is dying
Where everybody dreams of deeds of crime
And the tartan coloured lady walks
Behind the water colours of my mind
And the tartan coloured lady she's mine

People speak of willow trees in autumn
And my clove-key doesn't fit her anymore
And the tartan coloured Lady that I wanted
Talked of this place, an hour or so before
And the tartan coloured lady lost her dog

So if your crystal window isn't broken
And thеy've taken all the dustbins from your door
Takе yourself the tartan coloured lady
And smell the grass in Ashfield Park once more
See the trees in Ashfield Park once more
So I guess I'll read the comic books you've left me
And play marbles on the floor
And if the tartan coloured lady calls me
Just tell her I won't be home 'til four
Oh just tell her, I won't be home no more

So if your crystal window isn't broken
And they've taken all the dustbins from your door
Take yourself the tartan coloured lady
And smell the grass in Ashfield Park once more
See the trees in Ashfield Park once more
I'm just sitting counting all the cobwebs
And wondering just when you'll come along
You said that you'd be here an hour ago
But an hour ago is hours ago from then

No, and I don't know what to do
I'm drawing crazy patterns on my shoe
And the sand in the hourglass slips on by

Light another cigarette, watch the burning glow
Catching spiders in my hand, and then I let them go
Imagine pictures on the wall, watch the insects where they crawl
They don't care about you and I've nothing to do

No, and I don't know what to do
I'm drawing crazy patterns on my shoe
And the sand in the hourglass slips on by

Maybe the bus didn't get there on time
Maybe the train doesn't run on that line for some reason
And she might not come
Because she doesn't want to see you again
No no no, that can't be true
And I've got nothing to do
No, and I don't know what to do
I'm drawing crazy patterns on my shoe
And the sand in the hourglass slips on by

[Intro]
Regimental Sergeant Zippo

[Verse 1]
There's a picture in the nursery
Of a well know soldier man
And he wants to be like father
When he grows up if he can
His eyes survey the floorboards
With his soldiers around him
But, fear not for the future
You will climb the highest mountain

[Chorus]
So, Regimental Sergeant Zippo
Stand up to attention will you
(Regimental Sergeant Zippo)
Hear the bugle sound in the morning call up rising
(Regimental Sergeant Zippo)
So, you're cardboard castle is standing
You're the one who is commanding
Watch them march along the landing down the stairs

[Verse 2]
He's just a small boy in a small boys world
And small boys do strange things
He likes to see the matchsticks fly
And hear the cannons ring
For his eiderdown, his battlefield
And in his dreams his fights are real
Until the field is won, aim fire the guns

[Chorus]
So, Regimental Sergeant Zippo
Stand up to attention will you
(Regimental Sergeant Zippo)
Hear the bugle sound in the morning call up rising
(Regimental Sergeant Zippo)
So, you're cardboard castle is standing
You're the one who is commanding
Watch them march along the landing down the stairs

[Bridge]
Watch them march along the landing down the stairs
Aah

[Chorus]
So, Regimental Sergeant Zippo
Stand up to attention will you
(Regimental Sergeant Zippo)
Hear the bugle sound in the morning call up rising
(Regimental Sergeant Zippo)
So, Regimental Sergeant Zippo
Stand up to attention will you
(Regimental Sergeant Zippo)
Hear the bugle sound in the morning call up rising

[Verse 1]
I know you, you're trying to do
All you can for me
I appreciate your help
But it's best just to leave me be

[Pre-Chorus]
There's many things that I have done
And I'm sorry for them now
So, darling please don't you comfort me
I'll sort it out somehow

[Chorus]
So, sing me no sad songs
Tell me no lies
Please, don't you make me blue
Sing me no sad songs
Tell me no lies
Girl, I can do without you
Don't go breaking my heart
It would tear me apart
'Cause then, I'd be finished for good
So, sing me no sad songs
Tell me no lies
Please, don't you make me blue

[Verse 2]
I don't want you to think I'm mean
Refusing all your help
The time has come but, my need is none
And I wanna be alone with myself

[Pre-Chorus]
There's many things that I have done
And I'm sorry for them now
So, darling please don't you comfort me
I'll sort it out somehow

[Chorus]
So, sing me no sad songs
Tell me no lies
Please, don't you make me blue
Sing me no sad songs
Tell me no lies
Girl, I can do without you
Don't go breaking my heart
It would tear me apart
'Cause then, I'd be finished for good
So, sing me no sad songs
Tell me no lies
Please, don't you make me blue

[Chorus]
So, sing me no sad songs
Tell me no lies
Please, don't you make me blue
Sing me no sad songs
Tell me no lies
Girl, I can do without you
Sing me no sad songs
Tell me no lies
Girl, don't you make me blue
Sing me no sad songs
Tell me no lies

[Verse 1]
Nothing looks as bad
After staying up all night
And the cruel words that cut you down
I never meant to write
And what came out as anger
Oh was a lack of self control
Billy won't you hold me
Once before you go

[Verse 2]
Clever lies keep coming
Some men never change
I'm a hand that's raised in anger
The blow that causes pain
But I just can't be trusted
With a bottle and a child
Billy it's no wonder
You say I've never tried

[Chorus]
Oh so leave me now
Oh don't turn around
It's the best thing you ever did
But it's hard for me to say goodbyе
To Billy and the kids
Oh so leave mе now
Oh don't turn around
It's the best thing you ever did
But it's hard for me to say goodbye
To Billy and the kids

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
And what came out as anger
Oh was a lack of self control
Billy won't you hold me
Once before you go

[Chorus]
Oh so leave me now
Oh don't turn around
It's the best thing you ever did
But it's hard for me to say goodbye
To Billy and the kids
Oh so leave me now
Oh don't turn around
It's the best thing you ever did
But it's hard for me to say goodbye
To Billy and the kids
To Billy and the kids
To Billy and the kids
To Billy and the kids
To Billy and the kids

[Outro]
(But it's hard for me to say goodbye
To) To Billy and the kids

[Verse 1]
Look around, everywhere you turn is heartache
It's everywhere that you go (Look around)
You try everything you can to escape
The pain of life that you know (Life that you know)
When all else fails and you long to be
Something better than you are today
I know a place where you can get away
It's called a dance floor, and here's what it's for, so

[Chorus]
Come on, vogue
Let your body move to the music (Move to the music)
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, vogue
Let your body go with the flow (Go with the flow)
You know you can do it

[Verse 2]
All you need is your own imagination
So use it that's what it's for (That's what it's for)
Go inside, for your finest inspiration
Your dreams will open the door (Open up the door)
It makes no difference if you're black or white
If you're a boy or a girl
If the music's pumping it will give you life
You're a superstar, yes, that's what you are, you know it

[Chorus]
Come on, vogue
Let your body groove to the music (Groove to the music)
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, vogue
Let your body go with the flow (Go with the flow)
You know you can do it

[Bridge]
Beauty's where you find it
Not just where you bump and grind it
Soul is in the musical
That's where I feel so beautiful
Magical, life's a ball
So get up on the dance floor

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I was his pretty little plan
I was his everything
You've been saving up for the perfect ring
I was his last good kiss
His show and tell
I guess he thought he knew me well

[Chorus]
I'm his long gone
His cheatin' song
Just a little girl who did him wrong
His sleepless nights
His empty bed
Just a memory he can't get out of his head
Now, I know it's not new, I was long, I'm his long gone

[Verse 2]
He tells all of his friends
That I'm the one to blame
But if he was man enough, he'd've made me stay
He never еven tried
Tried likе he cared
I've bet he's sorry now that I'm not there

[Chorus]
I'm his long gone
His cheatin' song
Just a little girl who did him wrong
His sleepless nights
His empty bed
Just a memory he can't get out of his head
Now, I know it's not new, I was long, I'm his long gone

[Bridge]
He had his chance to love me
Like I was the best he ever had
I hate just saying that
"It's just too late and I'm never coming back"

[Chorus]
Now, I'm his long gone
His cheatin' song
Just a little girl who did him wrong
His sleepless nights
His empty bed
Just a memory he can't get out of his head
Now, we know it's not new, I was long
Well, I could see he wasn't that strong
He's the one who stopped holding on
Now I'm his long gone
Long gone

[Verse 1]
I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's making me say

[Chorus]
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Running to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

[Verse 2]
I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain

[Chorus]
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

[Bridge]
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know

[Chorus]
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so ho-ho-ho-holy

[Intro]
Yeah
Ahem

[Verse]
I probably should've put this dream on layaway
I woke up in a frenzy, today's the day
I threw the function, bitches drunk off the Tanqueray
Now she got me in handcuffs, slap me and tell me to say her name
That bitch got a crazy brain, but everything a-okay
She a really good time, besides, that pussy is ace of spades
I wake up with a hangover, she already makin' eggs
I call her on my layover, she send pictures, spreadin' legs
Goddammit, this life of minе
Should've been a superhero somеwhere out fightin' crime
Instead I was lightin' my weed
Gettin' Eiffel high, the tower that is
My girlfriend appreciate the gifts I shower her in
You see, 2010 was the year that I made it
But lookin' back on it now, that shit be feelin' so ancient
I get to crackin' a smile, I got 'em fiendin' put the crack in the vial
Stir a ruckus like the cat that's chasin' after the mouse
We be breakin' all the glass in the house
Friday was crazy, but it's Saturday now (Yeah)
I keep the glass half-full, the whisky bottle empty
Give praises to the most high, 'cause somebody up there bless me
It's nice bein' a millionaire but sometimes it's depressin'
We keep eatin' so much seafood, I'm just in the mood for Wendy's
I'm so regular, see?
It's crystal-clear insanity, that's ADHD
And I grew up with delinquents, we would play in the street
'Til it was late, causin' trouble while the neighborhood sleep
Runnin' away from police
What do we get older for? I wish I was only four
I wish I was sober more, but no, I be overboard
I'm sinkin' with my ship until it sit on the ocean floor
It's four in the mornin', I'm up and horny, downloadin' porn
I see the lies with eagle eye vision
We inside a dream of mine, we'll redefine livin'
All I need a television and some weed, I'm fine, chillin'
I'm hotter than a oven makin' pizza in your kitchen
Better keep your eyes peeled and open
Hit a blunt in the whip, tryna stunt with a bitch in the front
And a fifth I'ma sip 'til I'm sick and I'm drunk
I ain't givin' a fuck, yeah, I've been in a funk
Now I live like a pimp, into business stuff
A magician to tricks, make a bitch disappear like her boyfriend comin' to the game
Pay up like the first of the month, I'ma take what I want
Everybody need somethin', shit
If this my last day on this Earth, tell the kids to write my name in the dirt (Immortal)
Cup full of liquor, mind full of bad ideas
The club closed, why the fuck are we the last ones here?
How I'm gettin' home? Who is callin' the place?
God don't recognize me, he must have forgotten my face
Find my way in this strange world
Strange, strange world we live in
And I'ma leave this bitch lifted

[Verse 1]
When my life is over
Hiding in the corner
It's the love we shared
Our hearts must have deceived us
And this loneliness redeems us once again

[Verse 2]
We could never find it
Constantly reminded
That our love would end
It's happening in stages
And I'll cry about the changes

[Bridge]
I know
That it's hard for you
To be alone this time
You never trusted your heart, my dear
I think it's going to take a long time

[Verse 3]
Lost within the pages
Copy and then pastеd in your arms again
Is it just me dreaming?
I can't possibly beliеve and I'll pretend
That I'm right next to you
In these dreams
Come gather 'round people, wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth saving
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone
For the times, they are a-changin'

Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon, for the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
For thе loser now will be later to win
For thе times, they are a-changin'

Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times, they are a-changin'
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly aging
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
For the times, they are a-changin'

The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast
The slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past
The order is rapidly fading
And the first one now will later be last
For the times, they are a-changin'

[SNIPPET]

[Verse 1: 2D]
And the love is comin to eat my bones it's treason
All I could do is to see in my heart
(Hello, Hello)
And I know...down the wall
Living, living in the gates of a London

Heartbeat...

[Chorus]
Once had a love and it was a gas
It soon turned out I had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind
Once had a love and it was divine
I soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind

[Verse 1]
In between, what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good
You teasing like you do

[Chorus]
Once had a love and it was a gas
It soon turned out I had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's gone bеhind

[Verse 2]
Lost inside, adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm thе one you're using, please don't push me aside
We could've made it cruising, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Riding high on love's true bluish light

[Chorus]
Once I had a love and it was a gas
It soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind

[Verse 1]
All alone at the end of the evening
And the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have
Loved me but I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer
I've spent my life running 'round
And it's so hard to change
And I can't seem to settle down
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep turning out and burning out
And turning out the same

[Chorus]
So put me on a highway
And show me the sign
And take it to the limit one more time

[Verse 2]
You can spend all your life making money
And you can spеnd all your love making time
If it all fell to piеces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?
And when you're looking for your freedom
But nobody seems to care
And you can't find the door
No, you can't find it anywhere
When there's nothing to believe in
Still you're coming back, you're running back
You're coming back for more

[Chorus]
So put me on a highway
And show me the signs
And take it to the limit one more time

[Outro]
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
So take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more time
Oh just one more time

[Verse 1]
I can't seem to focus
And you don't seem to notice I'm not here
I'm just a mirror
You check your complexion
To find your reflection's all alone
I had to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't you hear me?
I'm not comin' home
Do you understand?
I've changed my plans

[Chorus]
'Cause I, I'm in love
With my future
Can't wait to meet her
And I, I'm in love
But not with anybody else
Just wanna get to know myself

[Verse 2]
I know supposedly I'm lonely now
Know I'm supposed to be unhappy
Without someone
But aren't I someone?
And I'd, ooh I'd like to be your answer
'Cause you're so handsome

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know better
Than to drive you home
'Causе you'd invite me in
And I'd be yours again

[Chorus]
But I, I'm in lovе
With my future
And you don't know her
Yeah I, I'm in love
But not with anybody else
I'll see you in a couple years

[Verse 1]
She'll only come out at night
The mean and hungry type
Nothing is new
I've seen her here before
Ooh yeah, watching and waiting
Ooh, she's sitting with you, but her eyes are on the door
So many have paid to see what you think you're getting for free
The woman is wild, a she-cat tamed by the purr of a Jaguar
Ooh, money's the matter
If you're in it for love, you ain't gonna get too far

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a maneater
Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a maneater, maneater

[Verse 2]
I wouldn't if I were you
I know what she can do
She's deadly, man
She could really rip your world apart
Ooh, mind over matter
Ooh, the beauty is there but a beast is in the heart, uh-huh

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a maneater, maneater
Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a maneater, maneater

[Bridge]
Ooh, here she comes, yeah
Ooh, here she comes, yeah
Ooh, here she comes, yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh, here she comes, watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes, she's a maneater
Ooh, here she comes, watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes, she's a maneater, maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Ooh, here she comes, maneater, maneater

[Chorus: Kane Brown]
I might be better on my own
I hate you blowin' up my phone
I wish I never met your ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm movin' on
I'm not afraid to need you bad
Sometimes it be like that

[Verse 1: Kane Brown]
We both wanna love
We both wanna slide
We both wanna argue until we're both right
And you want a hug
I kiss you goodnight
Maybe we're both just out of our mind (Ooh)
And you throw tantrums while I'm twistin' up
No medicine is fixin' us
Can't tell you why but tell you what
You got me thinkin'

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Swae Lee]
I might be better on my own
I hatе you blowin' up my phone
I wish I never mеt your ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm movin' on
I'm not afraid to need you bad (Bad)
Sometimes it be like that

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
I cross the seas wit' you (Hey, seas)
Wasn't even supposed to be wit' you (Yeah, be)
Yeah, and it gets crazy in the night
I cannot sleep with you (Sleep with you)
And I could keep you nice and warm (Ayy)
Won't do no thinking, I'm in love (Yeah, yeah)
If I was to give you the world (Yeah)
That's anything that you can think of (Of)

[Pre-Chorus: Swae Lee]
Got too much goin' to be upset
I swear I'd rather be your friend
I said I'm gonna be right back
It hurts, sometimes it be like that

[Chorus: Kane Brown, Swae Lee, & Both]
I might be better on my own
I hate you blowin' up my phone
I wish I never met your ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm movin' on
I'm not afraid to need you bad (Bad)
Sometimes it be like that

[Verse 3: Khalid]
Sometimes, when you thought you found the love of your life (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Now you're thinkin' I'm just one of those guys, leading on
I can't help when you read it wrong
Don't know why I trip on us
You put me down, I pick you up
Can't tell you why but tell you what (You should know that)
You got me thinkin'

[Chorus: Kane Brown, Kane Brown & Khalid]
I might be better on my own
I hate you blowing up my phone
I wish I never met your ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm movin' on
I'm not afraid to need you bad
Sometimes it be like that

[Outro: Khalid]
Yeah, yeah
Sometimes when you're fallin' off track
Baby, don't you leave me like that
Don't cry
'Cause we're both just out of our mind, yeah, ayy-ayy

[Chorus]
Well, if you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me

[Refrain]
I been lookin' for some love, but it ain't lookin' for me
That's why she bite her tongue when she tell me that pussy for me
And I been lookin' for somebody that been lookin' for me
Keepin' my two fingers crossed, but I'm still lookin' for peace
I been lookin' at the clouds, maybe they'll listen to me
Can't talk dirty to myself because the mirror's too clean
Tryin' never to look back because the light always green
It's safe to say I lost my way, but I never lost the lead

[Chorus]
And if you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me

[Verse 1]
Every time it beat, it break apart
I really think it's all my daddy fault
I can't find the keys to my heart
Think I'ma need the automatic start
Out there lookin' for love after dark
Then I get tired and it's an afterthought
Where's the love? Five question marks
Eat your heart out, I had to starve
It's the saddest part
I'm questionin' myself, I ain't gotta answer yours
Baby, that's for sure
I take a look at myself and then I just pass the torch
Baby, back and forth
I ask can we get together just to break back apart
Baby, that's the cure
Me, myself, I, my iPhone, Fantastic Four
Never knew 'take it or leave it' could be so literal
Never knew takin' a breather could be so physical
Never knew takin' it easy could be so difficult
Never knew takin' these drugs could be so spiritual
Never knew the chemist like how I know the chemicals
Never knew takin' a life could be so minuscule
Never know takin' chances will be individual
Never know takin' advantage would be inhospitable, how pivotal
Never knew the shit I never knew would be minimal, how cynical
Never knew love and hate were similar, identical

[Refrain]
I been lookin' for some love, but it ain't lookin' for me
That's why she bite her tongue when she tell me that pussy for me
And I been lookin' for somebody that been lookin' for me
Keepin' my two fingers crossed, but I'm still lookin' for peace

[Chorus]
And if you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
If you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' too deep

[Verse 2]
I can't find the keys to this life
Picked the locks, I might be a'ight
Close my eyes, I might see the light
Life is a bitch, she might be my type
Death is a bitch, she might be tonight
Haters kiss and dick-eaters bite
Tables turn every day 'n night
Three-sixty, three-sixty-five
I can't find no leaks to my pipe
Police can't find nor reason nor right
Been tryna let shit happen on the fly
But I can't find a seat on that flight
There's a private plane, that's simple and plain
Tickets at a more reasonable price
Sometimes, I don't know how it's gon' end
Even though I done seen the movie twice
Pop a wheelie, new motorbike
Some people like to live a slower life
Some niggas like to live cutthroat
I'ma be the nigga that hold the knife
You girl wan' hold me tight over night
Who am I to tell her wrong from right?
I'ma give her more dick than advice
You give her more strings to a kite
I just found a needle in a haystack, bitch, it's payback
I found myself talkin' to myself with nothin' to say back
And I just found the keys to a Maybach I had way back
Tryna find everything but my way back

[Chorus]
Yeah, well, if you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' for me
I been lookin' at my posse with a look of belief
I been lookin' my closet and it look like Paris
They been lookin' for your body, they been lookin' for weeks
They find you dead with your eyes open, lookin' for grief

[Outro]
I been lookin' at the clouds, they say they look up to me
Safe to say I lost some sleep, but I never lost my dreams
If you out there in the streets and you lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, I said I been lookin' too deep
They lost

I can't trust my iPhone, I can't trust these bitches
Haters praying for my downfall, at least they're religious
People in Hell, they want rainfall, your bitch just want these digits
I feel like I'm on her payroll how she pay my ass a visit
We put both iPhones on silent, both iPhones on silent
I only answer for my niggas, careful with that dialogue
Man, my house ain't got no house phone
My flip phone is a chip phone
Got a prepaid and that bitch on, but still, I use my bitch phone
'Cause I can't trust my iPhone, I can't trust my SIM card
I got Siri talkin' dirty to me, tryna make my dick hard
I got Tunechi on my ringtonе, my children on my home screen
I choke you with thе phone charger
Sold more crack than my phone screen, let's go
Fur floor mats, I'm bare feet, nigga
100K a week, that's a bad week, nigga
I can sell dogs to a cat freak, nigga
Sell monkey bars to a chimpanzee, nigga
But you never know what you never know
Nigga sell you coke and it wasn't coke
Hang 'em off the building and let 'em go
That's how you make a statement that they should quote
I seen death around the corner
And I lived right by the corner store
I'm a hot boy, I'll burn your hand
I'm a real life Untouchable
I run the show, I run the show
Sell anything but my soul
And I'm prayin' that the only cuffs
That touch my wrist come with button holes, for real
Smokin' on the good
Killin' these hoes like Blair Underwood
Rest in peace to my daddy Rabbit, I swear to his lucky foot
Ever since he died of jealousy, I've been looking for a cure
You see, my daddy had that work, now they watch his son get to it
And just like he ran them streets, I run with bulls
If niggas buyin' I throw out some numbers to 'em
Numbers soundin' yummy to 'em
You need more, just call my ho, I gave her phone number to 'em
'Cause you know

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the feds
I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the feds
Pull up in that thing with Stunna, paint it period red
Go tell your boss we can get 'em cheaper than where he paid
Let's go

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I can't trust my iPhone (Nope), .44 on my thighbone (Huh)
You can have the eye of the tiger
I'm the one the tiger better have his eye on, okay
Fussin' with my redbone (Bitch), hang up when my high gone (Why)
Ball 'til I fall, and when I do, them hoes gon' pile on, uh
Assault rifle, now mouth off
Some niggas make it all the way to the top and ball too hard then bounce off
Like my homeboy, let his bitch cook the work and it came out wrong
Almost beat that ho to death, I had to call my plug and vouch for him
'Cause I ain't even got an ounce for 'em
I keep running out on 'em
Everybody gotta eat, just try not to leave the mouse crumbs
.223 right here, this to keep the whole house warm
Then I skate by one of my hoes house, girl, I gotta use your house phone
'Cause she know I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the feds
I can't trust that Samsung, I think Sam the feds
Cocaine, pour the twenty-eight gram buffet
Turn your block into a police ambulance parade, let's go

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & 2 Chainz]
I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the feds (Woo)
I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the feds (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pull up in that thing with Stunna (Yeah), interior red (Tell 'em)
Go tell your boss we can get 'em cheaper than where he paid, let's go, yeah (2 Chainz, boom, boom, boom)

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne, 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne]
Hello? (Hello?)
Most of my niggas from the ghetto (Ghetto)
Through the concrete grew a rose (Grew a rose)
Petals smellin' like gun metal (Bah)
Smoke a joint the size of a limo (Yeah)
My girlfriend wearin' stilettos (Yeah)
My wife don't like when I call my girlfriend my girlfriend
She think she's special (Tru)
I whippin' and flippin' the extras (Woo, extra)
Fucked that bitch off a text message (Damn)
You know what it is when you fuck with the kid
I got medicine all in my beverage (Lean)
Look at your watch, it say my time (My time)
They callin' my phone like a hotline (Hotline)
I'm about to switch this shit up (Shit up)
Got a metro for my thot line (Woo)
Got to crip walk on the outside (Yeah)
Whip the same color apartheid (Yeah)
On the phone kickin', pimpin'
You know I surround that bitch out like a chalk line
Ooh, Siri backwards spell Iris
I ring, iPhone don't work on this island (True)
AK smilin' as I pose for a threat
All these bad hoes in here, we need a pole in this bitch
If they're quick to pick her up, I cut that bitch like a machete
I might overdose on shrimp scampi in Italy, I'm like

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & 2 Chainz]
I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the feds
I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the feds
Pull up in that thing with Stunna, interior red
Go tell your boss we can get 'em cheaper than where he paid, let's go, yeah
I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the feds
I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the feds

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
Uh, what's harder, life or Mr. Carter?
Balling 'til my hair is as white as Johnny Carson
You don't have to beg because I'm fresh out of pardons
Little voices in my head said, "Don't mind the little voices," woah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
What's sharper, spikes or Mr. Carter?
I ride for this shit like a knight in shining armor
I pile up the swishers, roll 'em tight like UnderArmour
Coming from this neighborhood, it's just like coming from comas
I got...

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
What's harder, life or Mr. Carter?
Balling 'til my hair is as white as Johnny Carson
You don't have to beg because I'm fresh out of pardons
Little voices in my head said, "Don't mind the little voices," woah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
What's sharper, spikes or Mr. Carter?
I ride for this shit like a knight in shining armor
I pile up the swishers, roll 'em tight like UnderArmour
Coming from this neighborhood, it's just like coming from comas
I got homies from the old school and we been lost our diplomas
Got some hoes from California and they shit smell like begonia's
Got a bone to pick, I'm boneless, that's a bonus
Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, pop up at the spur of the moment, how you want it?
When in Hell, I'm a Roman; head on fire, I'm a comet
Heat up out my abdomen, and you know it
Man I'm all about my business, business handle business for me
I know you know life's a bitch, I turned her to a business woman, mind your business
I'm like, "What's harder, life or Mr. Carter?
What's higher, the price or Mr. Carter?
Should I call you Mystery? Because I'm right here to solve you
If you start to smell fear or fright, I sprayed it on you"
I made it, I made it with you, you hate it, I made it, on you
You know the streets talk, my nigga, I made 'em argue
Niggas faded away, I light one and get faded for you
I'm reclinin', Weezy Baby, La-Z-Boy, do they enjoy you?

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I'm like, "What's harder, life or Mr. Carter? Yeah, uh
What's shorter, life or Mr. Carter? Haha"
I ask, "What's harder, jail or Mr. Carter?
School or Mr. Carter? Rules or Mr. Carter?
Man, what's harder, drugs or Mr. Carter?
Judge or Mr. Carter? Mr. Carter, huh?"

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
What's harder, love or Mr. Carter?
Especially when these hoes ain't right, these hoes ain't loyal
Shit, what's wrong or right? And what's the order?
I know this AK will get shit right and fix the toilet
I'll be a-okay as long as my wife could cook a quarter
The type of shit I won't take for granted, need the marble
See, you can't believe in all of the hype you hear at the barber
If the odds are stacked against us, they're likely to stack 'em on us
Lil Tune, aka no cartoon, no Hanna-Barbera
I ain't steal it, I took it, I ain't crooked, I'm cater-cornered
And if my fruits of labor were ripe, I would have an orchard
But I'm nauseous from my ups-and-downs and back-and-forwards
Shit, Mr. Carter, eyes are always on you
Throw a five in the air for C5 like, "Hi, how are you?"
Shit, what's harder, drugs or Mr. Carter?
The world is on my shoulder, I shrug to get it off from 'em, shit
What's harder, life or Mr. Carter?
Tune in this bitch, let's spike the Holy Water
Tryna stay grounded, my flights said no departures
Shit, what's harder, murder or abortion? Woah
What's harder, death or Mr. Carter?
Is it easier to play deaf or to listen harder?
I'm like, "Girl, what's harder than life for Mr. Carter?
Shit get hard, but I'm a termite to turmoil"
What's easier, to change diapers or back to normal?
Times are changing like Father Time just lost his father
What's harder, to ask for sorrow or to borrow?
Or to propose and get "I don't know"? I don't know

[Outro: Christina Milian]
What's harder than being Mrs. Carter?
What's harder than being Mrs. Carter?
What's harder than being Mrs. Carter?
What's harder than being Mr. Carter?
Uh, what's harder than being Mr. Carter?
What's harder than being Mr. Carter?
What's harder than being Mr. Carter?
What's harder than being Mr. Carter?
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

Blind date on a Tuesday
Bougie restaurant
N-n-n-no starter, didn't have a chance
You're playing twenty-one questions
Baby boy, give up
Got me feeling like Shania (Woo!)
That don't impress me much (Hey!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ay rookie, you're looking
A little bit shaky in the saddle (Giddy up!)
Admit it, you bit off
A little bit more than you can handle (Say what?)
I said it, forget it, I've had it
Don't make me cause a scandal (Woop, woop!)
I'm sorry, but you're not my type
You're going home alone tonight

[Chorus]
Boy, you're in over your head
Don't you know you'll be better off without me?
You're gonna wish you were dead
Think it's time that I call you a taxi
4 a.m., just getting started
Drive fast cars and crash your party
Boy, you're in over your head
Think it's time that I call you a taxi

[Post-Chorus]
C'mon
Let's call you a taxi
Taxi for one
Taxi for one

Let's call you a taxi

Nightclub on a Friday
Get my Gucci on

You coming at me like a player (Roof!)
But your game's all wrong
You get your words all twisted
It's the same old song (Hey!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ay rookie, you're looking
A little bit shaky in the saddle (Giddy up!)
Admit it, you bit off
A little bit more than you can handle (Say what?)

Lyrics from Snippet:

[Verse]
Planned out the conversation that we'll have when you see me
For the first time after these months of apathy
And you'll say that you want me back
And I'll say, "Babe, you don't mean that," ah-ah
'Cause I psychoanalyzed you better than your therapist
And I know that you don't love me
I know you just hate the risk of meeting someone else
Having to introduce yourself, ah-ah

[Chorus]
You're not a hopeless romantic
You're just a creature of habit
You want me 'cause I'm easy
You want me 'cause you know me
I'm not your soulmate, babe, I swear
No, I'm just there, ah-ah
Oh, I'm just there, ooh-ooh

[Jon Fields]
It’s funny how lovers become rivals
Steps to a dream that only becomes spirals
BANG!
Loaded tongues becomes rifles
And I could never forever becomes final
We burn reasons
To Grow from concrete, sown seeds turn seasons
Lies, Deceit, then conflict turns meanings
Scribble my thoughts as offers and burn leaflets
That’s Ritual
A man that stole life could pray favor
Just like the one that gave life could hate maker
Just like the one that spoke life could take
Taker
We born fake, the struggle’s the beauty, pain’s the makeup
Yeah, I runneth my name, break the chains up
Chains, the makeup
Tears the grip, Fear’s the lasso
Live, this the last go
Burn away the past, turn urn, let the ash go
Bang

[Verse 1]
Stay away from the emotion and madness
Stay away from the streets
For me, for me
Hide away from the moment that make us
Hide away from the streets
For me, for me

[Chorus]
It's a mad world, hey
It's a mad, mad world
It's a mad world, hey
It's a mad, mad world
Why can't we keep on living here? Yeah
It's a mad, mad world
Why can't we keep on living here? Yeah
It's a mad, mad world

[Verse 2]
Find a way to keep hiding your secrets
Find a way to complete
For me, for me
Stray away from the forces that make you
Stray away from deceit
For me, for me

[Chorus]
It's a mad world, oh
It's a mad, mad world
It's a mad world, hey
It's a mad, mad world
Why can't we keep on living here? Yeah
It's a mad, mad world
Why can't we keep on living here? Yeah
It's a mad, mad world
It's a mad world, oh
It's a mad, mad world
It's a mad world, hey
It's a mad, mad world
Why can't we keep on living here? Yeah
It's a mad, mad world
Why can't we keep on living here? Yeah
It's a mad, mad world

It's a mad, mad world
It's a mad, mad world

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
Three-hour drive, I'm headin' nowhere
I've got the time now that you're not here
I keep travelin' by, travelin' by
Lookin' for love, you got me lookin' for love

[Chorus: Alicia Keys, Both]
And I can't deny
As hard as I try
That you give me life
You give me life
And I can't deny
As hard as I try
That you give me life
You give me life

[Verse 2: SiR]
Three-hour drive, I'm headin' nowhere
I've got the time, but now that you're not here
I keep travelin' by, keep travelin' by
Lookin' for love, you got me lookin' for love

[Chorus: SiR & Alicia Keys]
I can't deny
As hard as I try
That you give me life
You give me life

Heart on my sleeve
No, you, no me
It's more than I can take

Heart on my sleeve
No, you, no me
It's more than I can take
Down on my knees, my love
It's more than I can take

Oh hmm, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Can't think clearly now
Have to wait and see
If you wanna be with me
One day, I want you
Next day, I’m all gone
Should you wanna be with me?

[Verse 1]
It's been some time since we have been alone
I don't know if it’s 'cause I'm never home
Or if it's 'cause I'm tired, don't share the same opinions
What is it then?
It's been some time and I don’t feel alone, but you do feel
That I am absent and as if I’m never really here
Having the same discussions, over and over again
What is it then?

[Chorus]
Can't think clearly now
Have to wait and see
If you wanna be with me
One day, I want you
Next day, I’m all gone
Should you wanna be with me?

[Verse 2]
I often feel like there's stuff I won't get over
Written in my skin like tattoos on my shoulders
Pictures that I see in since deleted folders
Was I happy then? Are you happy now?
When we sat outside, warmth around us like a blanket
I was fallin' high, and we kept lookin’ at the mansions
Next door to you, you wanted that
I wanted you, stuff we can't have

[Bridge]
Sabes que te quiero, honey
Espero que me puedas entender

[Chorus]
Can't think clearly now
Have to wait and see
If you wanna be with me
One day, I want you
Next day, I'm all gone
Should you wanna be with me?

[Verse 1]
Who’d-a guessed that Aqua Net
Could start a fire with a single cigarette
She wasn’t drunk, she wasn’t stoned
Just sick and tired of wonderin’ when he was coming home
She drove around, she found his car
They heard the boom from in the bar
He called the cops, she called his bluff
They hauled her off in high heels and handcuffs

[Chorus]
Crazy women, ex-wives and old girlfriends
Keep their crazy hidden till they’re pushed off the deep end
God forgive 'em, no, they weren’t born like this
No, crazy women are made by crazy men

[Verse 2]
He told his friends she was depressed
Borderline bipolar, a bitch with PMS
He cheats and lies, then plays the victim
He don’t know why they always seem to pick him

[Chorus]
Crazy women, ex-wives and old girlfriends
Keep their crazy hidden 'til they’re pushed off the deep end
God forgive 'em, no, they weren’t born like this
No, crazy women are made by crazy men

[Bridge]
Some take a pistol, some take an axe
Boy, if you build a fire, you better bet she’s got a match
Might be the teacher just down the street
The hairdresser or the housewife or that waitress that’s so sweet
And you won’t see it when you meet her
So be careful how you treat her
'Cause she might look just like me

[Chorus]
Crazy women, ex-wives and old girlfriends
We keep our crazy hidden till we’re pushed off the deep end
God forgive us, no, we weren’t born like this
No, crazy women are made by crazy men
No, crazy women are made by crazy men

[Verse 1]
You found somebody that treats you better than I can
You tell me he could do things for you that I can't
So now I'm caught up
Stuck up in the middle 'cause I know that I'ma miss you
But you better off without me
You found somebody that treats you better than I can
You tell me he could do things for you that I can't
So now I'm caught up
Stuck up in the middle 'cause I feel like you the issue
I won't blame you though, 'cause I can't

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I ain't do what I said I do
It's thirty minutes past one and I'm missing you, girl
I'm sorry I couldn't do what you want me to
It's thirty minutes past one and I'm with a new girl

[Chorus]
She don't, she don't do it how you do it
She don't, she don't do it how you do it
She don't, she don't do it how you do it
It's thirty minutes past one and I'm missing you, girl

[Post-Chorus]
I'm missing you, girl
I'm missing you, girl, haha
I'm missing you, girl (Yеah)
I'm missing you, girl (Look, look)

[Verse 2]
When it gets late, I gеt to thinkin' of what we could've been
You found someone that treats you better than I ever did
I ain't gon' lie, sometimes, I get jealous and
Act like I don't know why I'm in the position I am (Oh, yeah)
Shit, I know why, I just hate to admit it (I do)
I'ma get high 'cause I just wanna forget it (I do, oh)
I got a problem, I always seem to remember what I won't remember
Anything you say, I'm gon' forget it

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry that I ain't do what I said I do
It's thirty minutes past one and I'm missing you, girl
I'm sorry I couldn't do what you want me to
It's thirty minutes past one and I'm with a new girl

[Chorus]
She don't, she don't do it how you do it
She don't, she don't do it how you do it
She don't, she don't do it how you do it
It's thirty minutes past one and I'm missing you, girl

[Post-Chorus]
I'm missing you, girl
I'm missing you, girl, haha
I'm missing you, girl (Yeah)
I'm missing you, girl (Look, look)

[Outro]
Yeah, lemme hear that
I'm missing you, girl
I'm missing you, girl
I'm missing you, girl
I'm missing you, girl

[Intro]
Driven, yea
Track what up baby?
What's today? It's just, you know
Just push to express, you know?

[Verse 1]
Introspect, internet
Get a guppy, you just in a net
Him a vet might fix a puppy, smooth
Feels like chicken chutney in the neck
See, this isn't that it's a different threat
It's distant, you'll find yourself trippin on a different set
We don't mix and mesh, mix and match
You gotta flip the script this isn't act
Nor pat, veteran not veterinarian
No holy water? then presbyterian dairy then
Strippin stacks, pussy on the pole like missing cats
Where mister whiskers at?
What's that? Poles of guns
Stacks of sеrial numbers, they getting scratchеd
Like give to backs and get it back
Came with different strats we spittin facts all in the cracks
Still real even when fiction's spat
Hit the mat your Jujutsu wack
I'm Malcolm X with the temple tap
Money talks credentials chat
Simple raps, if I give you Shaq' the rim will crack
Then we can't even ball no more
Vlad won't even let a nigga call no more, damn
It's like everybody wants me switched and replaced
Lose the joy male strip I'll still put a dick in your face
Like slam dunks
Out of work, chaturbatin, ex-rappin, man hunk
With all my bods in handfuffs
Old woman paid to pull his pants up very slowly as he stand up
Haha, comedy shit
And i'll calm yo ass down like lobotomy sticks
Steal a nigga will like a robbery whip
Battle rappers be like ah ah
Switch the style up, emphasize the end rhymes and
Get your growls up, nigga like me will wash a nigga
Then pick the towels up, look back down, pick the tiles up
Reach through the floor grab the pipes and lift the house (yup)
Now, that's clearly hyperbole
In real life i can take a real knife, certainly
And throw it real nice and take a Glock 19
And keep my bullet circles real tight
I'm talking holes through the same hole
Fruit ninja, oranges and mangoes
I will slice them shits
Put the video on IG and watch you like them shits
Real talk, simple preachers
The most to lose leave us
The black ghost of Tsushima
I make genghis falls like losin jengas
Livin limosine scene that'll make a tina move from abusive singers
Real talk man the truth'll sting us
Dope fiends loot the leaners salute the slingers
Prostitution, the cops won't move a finger
Except to shoot and make us choose between us
Test your loyalty, arrested royalty
Won't king us but will make us rich
The mental acrobatics will make you flip
The fact you ain't figured that out should make you sick
Ah, but that's how the game goes
I just want flying cars so I can
Put a benz in the sky like rainbows
And get a gold ak-47 with diamonds in my aim holes
Tell them niggas i'm like three Jay-Z's
I know my lines by heart like EKGs
I know you want me gone but we can't leave
Sincerely yours Mr. RAT-AT-AT-AT-AT-AT-AT-AT-AT-AT-AT
Traaaakk!

[Verse 1]
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired, uh
I see the Devil out here in disguise, oh
Why the fuck you out here tryna play the victim? I
But today, I guess I realize, that’s how life goes
I done been through Hell and I survived the storm
I was on the couch, I was kicked out of my home
You say that you know, but only I know (I know, I know, I know)

[Chorus]
And all I hear is bad, bad, bad, bad news
I know you know too
Bad, bad, bad, bad news
It's all that I hear

[Verse 2]
Every day, a different headline, a new story
I know it's not real, so why do I worry?
I know you for yourself and not for me
The fame change people, why don’t you just call me?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh well, I'll be the bad guy until I flatline
Money make the best guys turn into some bad liars
I was right there when nobody was
Don't ever try to act like you were never loved

[Chorus]
And all I hear is bad, bad, bad, bad news (Bad, bad)
I know you know too (You know)
Bad, bad, bad, bad news (You know, you know)
It's all that I hear (It's all that I hear)
Bad, bad, bad, bad news
I know you know too
Bad, bad, bad, bad news
It's all that I hear (Call, call)

[Bridge]
A lot of people changed that I never thought would
But my family straight, my money long, so fuck it, I'm good
Shit, a lot of people changed that I never thought could
These people ain't a hundred like they said that they was

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh well, I’ll be the bad guy until I flatline (Bad guy)
Money make the best guys turn into some bad liars (You know)
I was right there when nobody was (You know, you know)
Don’t ever try to act like you were never loved

[Chorus]
And all I hear is bad, bad, bad, bad news
I know you know too
Bad, bad, bad, bad news
It's all that I hear (Call, call, call)

Lyrics from snippet:

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Let's go, let's go, baby
Girl you make me feel real good
Just come over 'cause I wanna link up
I wanna make love
Lay a little, lick the middle
Let's set the mood
On me, yeah, you
Yeah baby
Lyrics from snippet:

Go
In the pitch black, girl, you're my baby
Here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go
Lyrics from snippet:

[Chorus]
Sex memories (Oh)
When you look at the bed, you think of me
When you're looking back, you're seein' me

[Verse]
When I look at the backseat of my Rover
Had plenty room, so that one time, I bent you over

[Intro: DaBaby]
Billboard Baby, Dua Lipa make 'em dance when it come on
Everybody lookin' for a dancefloor to run on

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yеah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, comе on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
I'm one of the greatest, ain't no debatin' on it (Let's go)
I'm still levitated, I'm heavily medicated
Ironic I gave 'em love and they end up hatin' on me (Go)
She told me she love me and she been waitin'
Been fightin' hard for your love and I'm runnin' thin on my patience
Needed someone to hug, even took it back to the basics
You see what you got me out here doin'? (Yeah)
Mighta threw me off, but can't nobody stop the movement
Uh-uh, let's go
Left foot, right foot, levitatin' (C'mon)
Pop stars (Go), Dua Lipa with DaBaby
I had to lace my shoes for all the blessings I was chasin' (Go)
If I ever slip, I'll fall into a better situation
So catch up, go put some cheese on it
Get out and get your bread up (Yeah, yeah)
They always leave when you fall, but you run together (Hey)
Weight of the world on my shoulders, I kept my head up
Now, baby, stand up, 'cause, girl, you

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa & DaBaby]
You want me (Hey), I want you, baby (Hey)
My sugarboo, I'm levitating

[Post-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm levitating (Woo)
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Woo)

My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop

[Intro: Kevin Parker]
Line, tides, pain
Sign, strange, night
Line, tides, pain
Sign, strange, night

[Verse 1: Kevin Parker]
Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time for something
How was I to know?
How was I to know this high came rushing?

[Chorus: Kevin Parker]
We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday

[Verse 2: Kevin Parker]
Go, there I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A.​
Askin' how I managed to end up in this place
And I couldn't get away

[Chorus: Kevin Parker]
We're on the borderline
Dangerously far and all forgiven
There's gonna bе a fight
Gonna be a price to pay on Monday
We'rе on the borderline (On the borderline)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time (Then I saw the time)
Watched it speedin' by like a train, like a train

[Refrain]
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
If there's room, room for doubt
As within, as without ya
Will I be so in love?
Any closer? Close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the Sun
Here comes the Sun
Ah, ah, ah

[Verse 3]
Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
How could I have known?
How was I to know this high came rushing?
I said, "Come with me outside"
I need to clear my mind, this weight is crushing
Do you see the light, oh
Coming from their eyes? Oh no
And I couldn't get away

[Chorus]
We're on the borderline (Ooh)
Gets me every time, these close encounters
Just to know I can (Just to know I can)
Once again, I am alone

[Refrain]
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved?
L.A. really messed me up
And it isn't cut and dry
Conversation, well, I tried (I was fine without ya)
Will I be? Stay right here
Any closer? Bad idea
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?

These niggas ain't woke, these niggas ain't woke like me
Hop off the boat like me

[Intro: Nick with Brian]
Oh yeah, oh-ooh-ooh
Yeah-hey, oh-no

[Verse 1: Nick & Brian]
It's another night, another day
It's another street with another name
Just another storm, just another rain
But now nothing feels the same
Yesterday I thought this was solid ground
Just another thing I was wrong about
But I never learn till I crash and burn
Just another textbook case of...

[Chorus: All & Nick]
Playing with fire
When I should have left love alone
Maybe I should have listen when they said
"Don’t try this at home
(Don't try this at home)
Don’t try this at home
(Don't try this at home)
Don’t try this at home"

[Verse 2: AJ & Nick]
Guess what now, I can live without
All the foolish love people talk about
Better by myself with no one around
(Yeah-yeah)
But that's what I'm saying now
But that's such a lie 'cause I know that once
I look in her eyes, I fall back in love
But I never learn till I crash and burn
Just another textbook case of...

[Chorus: All, Brian & Nick]
Playing with fire (with fire)
When I should have left love alone
(I was gonna, I was gonna)
Maybe I should have listen when they said
"Don’t try this at home
(Don't try this at home)
Don’t try this at home
(Don't try this at home)
Don’t try this at home"
(Said I was playing)
Playing with fire (with fire)
When I should have left love alone
(When I should have left love alone)
Maybe I should have listen when they said
"Don’t try this at home
(Don't try this at home)
Don’t try this at home
(Oh, don't try this at home)
Don’t try this at home"

[Bridge: Howie]
Call me crazy but I've been here before
And I promised myself that I wouldn't fall
But look at me now I'm so lost (ooh-ooh)
I guess I'm gonna have to learn the hard way because
I have a problem with one thing I shouldn't touch
I know that love is dangerous
But I can't keep on...

[Chorus: All, AJ, (Howie) & Nick]
Playing with fire (yeah-hey-hey!)
When I should have left love alone
(Should've left love alone)
Maybe I should have listen when they said
"Don’t try this at home (don't try this)
(Don't try this at home)
Don’t try this at home (don't try this)
(Don't try this at home)
Don’t try this at home" (hey-yeah)

[Outro: AJ]
Playing with fire, playing with fire

[Intro]
And to think
That a woman
A woman that I love so dear
Could make me sicker to my stomach, woah-oh
And to think I walked a thousand miles
Down this lonely road, baby, uh-oh (Damn)

[Chorus]
My heart is cold (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Woah, oh, cold (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Woah, my heart is cold (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Oh, oh-oh, cold (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Woah, my heart is cold, oh, yeah (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
My heart is cold, oh, yeah (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Uh-oh

[Bridge]
And to think, think about it
Just to think a woman, woah-ooh
That could ever make me feel this low
For things that I didn't do
So tell me, baby, I need to know
Is this how you comin'?

[Chorus]
My heart is cold (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Woah, oh, cold (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Woah, my heart is cold (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Woah, oh, cold (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Woah, my heart is cold (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
My heart is cold, oh, yeah (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
My heart is cold, oh, yeah (Woah-oh, woah-oh)
Uh-oh

[Verse]
I was trippin', I was sippin' on some lean, uh
Stampede comin' while I walk out the arena
On a phone call with you, tryna make the team 'cause
All these birds on me, you could hear the chirp on me
I was cruisin' through the city in the G63, oh
Lookin' for somebody but I found it when I seen her
In the H-Town, my baby, you was D'up
Spotted me, was coolin' in my jewelry, I'm freeze up
Know you wanna fuck with me, what's up with ya?
The last thing I wanna hear is, "It's a dub with ya"
I know the people 'round you don't wanna see me with ya
But they don't give you dick and plus, I'm richer

[Outro]
I put my heart in your hands
Hopin' you'd hold me once again
How could you do the things you did?
Knowin' my heart burns for you like it did
You can come home
Come home, I'll welcome you in with, with open arms
You can always come back (You can always come back)
You can always come back (You can always come back)
Come home to me, uh (You can always come back)
Just come home to me (You can always come back)
You can always (You can always come back)
Always come back to me (You can always come back)

[Intro: Media Montage]
It's one of the crazier stories we’ve heard of, guys (I know)
As it's unfolding it's like—Fuck Tory Lanez, okay? Now, I’m from Houston, and he's from, bro
And to think that the whole night unfolded on social media
You are the alleged shooter of Megan Thee Stallion
Instagram, in the pool with Kylie Jenner
Was she backtracking with what she said originally?
You know, maybe that's why we don't have a report
Donkey of the day
Some bitches tryna  take up for Tory and, "It's more to the story," bitch, it ain't-there ain't nothing to the story
Tory Lanez got a lot of bad press
Serious, he's gon’ get deported
Donkey of the day for Friday August 21st goes to Daystar Peterson
So they got pulled over and she had been shot already, great
Well, hold up—
Donkey of the Day
What I’m looking like, he looking at the police and then shot her?
Niggas like that, you a sucker, he's the king sucker, he’s the-he's the biggest sucker in the industry (Facts)
We gotta talk about Tory Lanez and Megan Thee Stallion
Kaash is looking for you, dawg
Because the police came out saying, "We didn't even know she was shot"
Guess who I believe? Megan
The best thing for Tory Lanez is for real, he needs to just begone

[Interlude]
I'm done with this, you gotta know the truth

[Verse]
Ayy, they rather see me in the cell
Like how he posted out with thirty thousand dollar bail?
I’m the GOAT, y'all niggas know I made that dope float on the scale
I had them hoes goin' crazy, fiends crackin', goin' pale
They know I'm real, I got that flow, it's on sale if you need a rush
Coke blowin' out my fiend's nose like the speaker bus
Ho caught me D'd up, talk down, we T'ing up
Megan people tryna frame me for a shootin'
But them boys ain't clean enough
I see how they teamin' up, watchin' and I'm calculatin'
Gotta keep it quiet, I can't jeopardize the outcome waitin'
Seein' certain niggas hatin', like, how this nigga hatin'?
I done gave these people so much features, made these niggas famous
They was on the blog sayin' I'm canceled from this entertainment
I was on that Spotify like thirty million monthly listeners, I'm fuckin' goin' crazy
And my fans support me brazy, everythin' I do is for you, I promise I'll be on it daily
I got nothin' but love to spread, but niggas hate me
Hurt my heart to see them Twitter fingers come from Kehlani's and Kaash Paige's
But I flipped the switch, I'm grippin' money at that fast pace
And don't ask me for shit when it get real, that's my last favor
Can't cry now 'cause I'ma laugh later
Girl, you had the nerve to write that statement on that affidavit
Knowin' I ain't do it but I'm comin' at my truest
Tryna keep this shit two hunnid with you, shorty, I can prove it
But them people in yo ear, they the true ones that I fear
They really got you thinkin' Tory Lanez would do you in, for real
Don't forget you was my bitch, I held it down and kept it real
I would never paint no fake picture of you just for some mills
And I thought that you was solid too, but look at how you doin' me
Look at how you doin' me, people tryna ruin me
And what's even worse is I'm still thinkin' about you and me
How you goin' live my birthday with all your jewelry to try to make some fool of me?
But I love you hard so I'm gon' cool it, B
'Cause I was coolin' right with Cuban, B, that was a stupid me
Somehow I'm still down to renegotiate the unity
My heart in some foolery, this shit is just confusin' me
I'm goin' through these phases, but I gotta stack that paper
And the real estate niggas hatin', took me off that application
But when they took that from me, they really took that from my baby
What the fuck I'm finna say to his old lady?
What the fuck y'all mean, my son don't need a house?
My baby momma don't need safety?
And even though I got the payment, the real estate niggas still hatin'
'Cause he watchin' me all on the news, but I ain't charged with no cases
Say the owner say my case is lookin' crazy, how the fuck that even make sense?
New times turn to past tense
All I want is straight cash, niggas say I lack sense
Star player, hearin' lies comin' from the back bench
Kill or be killed, that's the reason I don't have friends
Niggas lyin' on the crodie, niggas sayin' I'm deported
Oh, now I'm 5'3"? Niggas sayin' I'm a shorty
But lil' bitch I'm 5'7", money on me side-steppin'
And if I stand on my wallet, you can see my thighs in Heaven
One Umbrella gang and when we come back, don't you try reppin'
'Fore I let these niggas breathe, I gotta teach a couple lessons
Gotta see a couple questions: how the fuck you get shot in your foot, don't hit no bones or tendons?
How the fuck your team is tryna to paint me as some whole menace?
I just lost like ten million dollars because this cold business
But I got like ten million followers that's gon' roll with me
Fans that support me 'cause they know my heart
So I don't give a damn if shorty know Jigga
I was taught to beat the block
Eeny, meeny, miney in these streets, and so my Nina cocked
Niggas, y'all can play me, y'all can frame me, but I'ma reach the top
I would never put you in no danger, and if I did, you would've said it when you seen the cops

[Chorus]
Ayy, Lamborghini bands and they comin' out the floor
Fff, hit the fan when I'm pullin' out the dough-oh
I would never fall out with niggas over hoes, ayy
Money over fall outs, my nigga, that's the code-oh
Santorini bands when I pull up to the coast
Better have my bands when I pull up to the door-oh
Niggas can't believe I done pulled up in a Ghost
And I don't ever wanna fuck with y'all no more, G

[Outro]
I got bad bitches tryna have a orgy
Keep umbrellas for the days it get stormy
I pour the Henny for my niggas, that's before me
My outfit fly, you gotta seat out by the floor seats
She tatted me all on her face 'cause she adore me
They talkin' petty 'bout me but they lookin' corny
I had to fight for mine, nigga, you were sworn in
And God bless me when I wake up every mornin'

[Verse 1]
Fuck them other niggas, you see me all in your day shift
Money on me lookin' like it went and got a facelift
You been trippin', I been trippin', still ain't on the same shit
You still in my kitchen, arguin' about the same shit
Who and what and why and why I don't call you my main bitch
Everything is changin'
Friends turn to strangers, friends turn to dangers
Friends ain't your friends if they givin' ultimatums
Flippin' all the pages, dip off in the Range, oh
I done been through all these stages
You just act so different now, ain't nothin' that amazes
Me when you be trippin', how you speak when you be trippin'
I can see that you be slippin', that's tequila that you sippin', I know
Yes, that I was trippin', I envisioned somethin' different from the situation
You was my bitch, not only that, you was my nigga
Got me through when all these niggas hated
You started takin' me too serious and that's when all this desolated (Damn)
You yourself don't even know the full story
Why you lettin' people escalate it?
And I know you got them people in yo' ear
But we both know the situation, niggas hate it
Fuck all that for now, we'll talk about it when it's time
It feel like my lil' baby been confiscated
Taken away from me, I was makin' a way for us
We was trippin' off them couples, tryna do it how they do it
We was up and she was up and I was up, we PJ flew it
It was fluent, had us movin' like it's water to the fluid
I'm your water, you're the cruise, I had it movin' how you movin', woo
Out of mind and out of sight, I been gettin' right
I slid with the crodies, I been on the flight
Nine bands in my pocket, .19 on my right
I been outta pocket, I had to get right
I pray to the Lord, yeah, I had to get right
Lord, please give me patience when I see them lie
I hope one day me and you see eye to eye
I hope one day me and you see eye to—

[Bridge]
We both know what happened (We)
What happened to passion
Doin' the most and you know that it's takin' me back in
Hidin' emotions and stories, but you know it don't work

[Verse 2]
A couple things won't ever change
The common propaganda around my name is never strange
But when does it get strange?
When you start lyin' to your best friend 'bout us doin' things
And hopin' she ain't entertain?
Or is it strange when the lovin' come with secrets and the games?
When the world unveil your curtains and all they laughin' at's your pain
But does it change when we both reveal that both our mothers died?
And we still dealin' with some pain and need someone to entertain
Or does it change when you break down in my arms and start cryin'?
And feelin' like you alone and I tell you, "Everything's okay"
And I know I ain't runnin' game, even Munchie know my aims
But will you ever know my name and not just Tory from this fame?
Will we ever talk about this? Will we ever console again?
Or will we keep on actin' like I put you in danger and some pain?
And when you hop back in the car with me, you knew everything was safe
Pshht, please don't let these niggas make you change
We both know what happened that night and what I did
But it ain't what they sayin'
But when the feeling's change, the pain start oozin' from the heart
And start cruisin' through the vein
Start leakin' out your mouth when you hop on the live and talk live
It's oozin' through your brain, listen
We watched them animes, still granted from my player phase
Potentials of bein' Bey and Jay, just watchin' for my fan base
I'm just tryna get back to the days when you would hop back on the jet
Land in Miami for a span of days and stay with me
Or back when I would do the same, Atlanta plane from A to Z
And pull up in your driveway in the AMG
When 4oe would run up out the door and you would come outside, lookin' gracefully
And I'd step out the car and see your two arms embracin' me
We both playin' games with money, powers and fames
But just tell me how it changed, have your feelings rearranged?
Or deep down, are they the same? 'Cause I just wanna reconcile with ya
Spend a while with ya, send some flowers, watch a smile hit ya
After Kellen do your hair, you send a wild picture
Then you callin' me to come step out with ya
Type of shit I like to do, type of ways I like to move
All directions in my view, still pointin' right to you, damn

[Spoken Word]
So many critics against me, it's startin' not to offend me
So much lies to the people, they started not to defend me
The ballers, the rappers, singers, niggas with Emmys
Got me thinkin' from the start, they was holdin' some hidden envy
My peers that get offended, I love you but I meant it
Once upon a time, we had this thing called friendship
Instead y'all betrayed me, talk loud in your mentions
You laughed at my pain and only at my expenses
You wеnt from, "That's my brother for life. Quarantine, Quarantinе"
To now y'all just showin' me what bein' alone means
I don't hold it against you, you see me, it's love
You know I know what it is 'cause I know what it was
This is what fame 'bout, clickbaitin' the clout
Believin' one side of the story 'fore the other side come out
When your most firm believers are all startin' to doubt
Die for your soul before they kill you for clout

[Intro]
Quarantine, quarantine, quarantine
Well, dammit, Bob, I won't be a ghetto niggas in the hood's uncle (Perfect)
If you look at her tig ol' biddies (Calcium)
Straight out the doctor's room to the OnlyFans, there she goes (Ain't nobody got time for that)

[Chorus]
Oh, we already know, you just got it done
What it's pokin' out for? What it's fallin' out for?
What it's fallin' out for? What it's fallin' out for?
You just got it done, now you got 'em callin' out, "Yo"
You done switched your number, but why they callin' out for?
Heavy on the steppin', but I'm walkin' out slow
Heavy on the steppin', but I walk, walk, walk, walk

[Verse 1]
Heavy on the steppin', shawty bought herself a baby Benz
Seventy on sеven when she at thе gas station 'bout elevie I be steppin'
Danny Glover's mitten bitch, I'm fuckin' anythin' I'm catchin'
I got fast money goin' in, slow money goin' up
Tryna find a way to money, baby boy I know the route
Had this bitch play me on the blog said we goin' out
'Set told us, "They'll do anythin', for clout"
She got a lot of ass, and she got a lot of mouth
She done tallied up the stripper money, got herself a house
We ain't playin', cat and mouse, but I'll steal it, clap it out

[Chorus]
We already know, you just got it done
What it's pokin' out for? What it's fallin' out for?
What it's fallin' out for? What it's fallin' out for?
You just got it done, now you got 'em callin' out, "Yo"
You done switched your number, but why they callin' out for?
Heavy on the steppin', but I'm walkin' out slow
Heavy on the steppin', but I walk, walk, walk, walk

[Verse 2]
Heavy on the steppin', and I'm deadly with the cross
And I'm heavy with the checkin' on the celly like a boss
Meal prep me when I check-in, I'm a walk to the bank
They gon' let me put the check-in
Shawty twerk that ass for me if I got, to pay up
Shake what your mama or yo' doctor gave ya
Bust it back, oh, for real, you don't gotta fake, uh
Last time you know you made it hot, Jamaica
You be doin' numbers on your OnlyFans
Makin' every nigga feel like they your only mans
You say you don't strip on there, you just only dance
You tell me this the same shit that you would put on the 'Gram
Talkin' contour for ya and you poppin' pretty
Now you only date niggas out the poppin' cities
You ain't fuckin' unless the nigga got the dollars with him, ayy
(Tea)

[Chorus]
We already know, you just got it done
What it's pokin' out for? What it's fallin' out for?
What it's fallin' out for? What it's fallin' out for?
You just got it done, now you got 'em callin' out, "Yo"
You done switched your number, but why they callin' out for?
Heavy on the steppin', but I'm walkin' out slow
Heavy on the steppin', but I walk, walk, walk, walk
Heavy on the steppin', but I walk

[Chorus]
Uh, stepped out on bail, I did a Diddy Bop
I had to tilt my hat at the city cop
I walk away free 'cause I'm innocent
And when I walk, the whole world know a nigga wild (He's wildin')
We been at the gas station, all night (All night with it)
We been at the gas station, all night (Ha)
They done had the bag waitin', all night (Damon, we back)
Tell them that it's lit, bitch, we on fire
Ayy, praise to the most high
Ayy, praise to the most high
Uh, sendin' praise to the most high
Praise to the most high

[Verse 1]
Uh, devil want a nigga soul
I beat that nigga thousand times in a row
Couple weeks ago, he thought he threw his best shot
All I'm lookin' at is Twitter playin' "friend-or-foe"
Clout chasers need the relevancy
Hard talk come from irrelevant MC's
None of those guys are relevant as me
Guess what that means, I'm on a whole 'nother league
Wait, don't stop, let's sell another story (Ah)
What the fuck happened to rap? This isn't for me (Ah)
Never did I ever think that I would see the day (Nah)
Rap niggas tellin' the cops to come for me (Uh)
They tried to turn me to a cold felon (Facts)
All they helped me do is get some more millions (More facts)
All I see is, "Free Tory, free Tory" (Hahaha)
Homie, I was in Miami on the shore chillin' (He's wildin')
I got a whole new chick, mean
We on the Island and she fuck me like she off a bean
I'm out in Jersey and I'm ballin' like I'm off the team (We high)
I bought a four, it's a Birkin or it's all Celine

[Chorus]
Stepped out on bail, I did a Diddy Bop (I did that)
I had to tilt my hat at the city cop (That's a fact too)
I walk away free 'cause I'm innocent (Hahaha)
And when I walk, the whole world know a nigga wild (He's wildin')
We been at the gas station, all night (All night with it)
We been at the gas station, all night (Ha)
They done had the bag waitin', all night (Damon, we back)
Tell them that it's lit, bitch we on fire
Ayy, praise to the most high
Ayy, praise to the most high
Uh, sendin' praise to the most high
Praise to the most high

[Verse 2]
Soon as I get my masters back, they want chatter (Haha)
Now I'm independent, niggas won't fend it (Facts)
White labels tryna turn my Black folk against me

[JAY-Z] Been sellin' weed, that nigga don't offend me (Ha)
Tell my trappers get the bloomin' bags ready (Bag ready)
We finna fill 'em bitches up with mad reggie (Already)
Take 'em to the block, sell 'em at exclusive price (Haha)
And if they ask why it's trash, at least the bag heavy (Hahaha)
Devil want a nigga soul (Facts)
I beat that nigga a thousand times in a row (Nigga, facts)
Ballin' on a demon like a pick-and-roll (Facts)
She ugly, then I gotta hit her with the woah (He's wildin')
Shit up in this bitch, goin' hard nigga (Goin' hard, baby)
Runnin' through these bitches like a yard, nigga (Like a yard, baby)
I'm watchin' Complex for the talks, nigga (Woo)
'Cause it's an everyday struggle, fuck Mal, nigga (Nigga, fuck 'em)
I got love for 'em 'til they count me out (Uh)
Niggas mad I spun they bitches like a roundabout (Nah)
I see niggas tryna kick me when I'm down and out (I see you, baby)
But I came in here with a purpose I ain't 'round for clout (I worked nights for this)
Uh, Illuminati trynna get me, nigga (Facts)
But I'm the one they gotta spare like a Britney, nigga (Nigga, facts)
Through the hot or cold, I will never sell my soul (Never)
And if I gotta die for that, I'm dyin' Christian, nigga
I spent four seasons at the Four Seasons (That's regular)
I might even flex just for no reason (Regular)
Got a penthouse in D.R. and P.R
I call it pH balance and it's Puerto Rican (Haha)
These niggas don't like me (They don't like me)
I'm finna Gucci, man, and I'm so icy (Super ice, nigga)
Uh, wear these niggas out like a white tee (Ah)
My comeback rate super pricy (We checked it)

[Chorus]
Stepped out on bail, I did a Diddy Bop (I did that)
I had to tilt my hat at the city cop (That's a fact too)
I walk away free 'cause I'm innocent (Hahaha)
And when I walk, the whole world know a nigga wild (He's wildin')
We been at the gas station, all night (All night with it)
We been at the gas station, all night (Ha)
They done had the bag waitin', all night (Damon, we back)
Tell them that it's lit, bitch we on fire
Ayy, praise to the most high
Ayy, praise to the most high
Uh, sendin' praise to the most high
Praise to the most high

[Intro: Tory Lanez]
Yeah
(Come in)

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Names that you know me by, praise to the holy high
Shit, been a lonely ride, all I do is only try
Weed is my only high, magazine forty-five
I can tell the pain in youngin' from my shorty's eyes
Rap niggas gettin' at me, young niggas pickin' at me
I'm shootin' past the limits, a nigga trigger happy
Shade Room gettin' nasty, Black girls flippin' at me
Bestfriends switchin' on me, shit, at least a nigga happy
White drapes on the wall, white babes on the call
Spanish joints on the call, white grape on the pour
Champagne where you see us, man came from to see us
Jay-Z and Penny Marshalls, I felt that and it's awful
Fake niggas tryna play me, lame bitches tryna blame me
Same niggas gassed up, same niggas tryna flame me
We made it past the margin and past the section eighty
We got white people marchin', this shit is fuckin' crazy
We gon' be on the favors, I'm soapy on the faker
It's real shit goin' on, George and Breonna Taylor
Type shit ain't on the fogal, fly bitches on my scrotum
They pay me for appearance and pay me for my vocals
Yeah, fuck all that happy shit niggas want me on
It's niggas in my line of work that want me gone
House that come with alarms, spouse that come with a charm
Lamb' that sit in garage, that don't come from the farm
I see wonderful views, when God got me, it'll pay any one of my dues
Holla at one of y'all, choose, how I was one of them dudes
Well if you was them you'd probably front on me too
Yeah, if I was you and you were me, I would stunt on me too
Cash from seein' blessings, I got too much money at this point to be aggressive
I hate bein' outside knowin' I need to stress it
I hate overprovin' myself without bein' present, preach nigga
Get in the booth now, so I'm like givin' it my own shit now

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Lame niggas talk about me, same niggas walk around me
Hate me and strongly doubt me, I feel like Robert Downey
Back through the fly again, hoes sayin' "hi" again
Newly and improved suit, yeah lil' bitch, I'm Ironman
Hotter than bacon oil sittin' in the fryin' pan
New set of wings on me, Red Bull, flyin' man
We don't even count the money, we weigh it up and we eye the bands
I'm pullin' fuckin' strings, I feel like Einer Bankz
God usin' my situation to break the limitations
Soar past the niggas hatin', more past the shit that's waitin'
Devil in his recreations, Black on Black segregation
Turnin' us against each other, faith ain't gotta test your patience
Black boy, shine, nigga, Black women, grow baby
Black boy and Black women together, now that's a soul baby
That's on my soul, baby, down to the toes, baby
The feelin' to feel like "d-d-d, d-d-d, d-d-d, d-d-d, d-d-d"
Let's have some conversations, F all the contemplations
Look how we livin', young world, peep all the abominations
Shit is a prime example, truth in that time of answer
Truth and the time'll tell like Mike and Chance when it's time to sample
Slide through the vacant door, fuck niggas hate me more
Have we got this critical that we can't even be human and let niggas even make mistakes anymore?
What happened to bein' us? What happened to bein' more? Wassup

[Bridge: Yoko Gold]
Woah, sexy moonlight dance on the horizon
It's over, it's cold and full of violence
I pray you find peace inside the silence
I pray that you see the light
Your words sting like bees all on my body
Make me sip, I speed in that Bugatti
Devil's on my soul and on my body
Just pray that I see the light

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
You know I-I realize I want to be like a-a walkin' testimony to-to kids
Or to-to teens and people who are worldwide that, you know they allow like the internet, the social media, the fake ass cancel culture to bring 'em down and—
You know thirty comments, two hundred comments, a thousand comments about you one day brings your world down
I want y'all to look at me and realize I'm walkin' testimony of someone who just doesn't give a fuck about none of that shit
Imagine the whole fuckin' world and a bunch of millions of mothafucka's just hatin' at the same time
Actin' like as if you're not human as if, you know a thousand death threats later you gon' feel the same you gon'—, you know?
But in all of that, you know, I kept a smile on my face because I knew what I know and beyond everything I want you to look at my situation and gain strength from me and realize that nigga, say what, "I didn't give a fuck, you ain't gotta give a fuck either"
And whatever you gon' do shall pass just like everything else in your life
You know the waves go, they go and you keep sailin'
Just keep sailin', keep sailin', keep sailin'
Eventually, you get to your destination and guess what?
You look back and you can't even see niggas no more
So never forget, it's three things: how special you are, the purpose you come with, the reason you're here
God bless you

[Intro: Tory Lanez, Jamal Smith]
His hair, wack, his gear, wack
His jewelry, wack, his foot stance, wack
The way that he talks, wack
The way that he doesn't even like to smile, wack
Me, I'm tight as fuck
Look

[Verse: Tory Lanez]
All I'm catchin' is niggas on Twitter, dissin'
And talkin' lies on they lives
I cannot recognize my ex-twin in full disguise
Since I went independent, these niggas want my demise
But I am yeast to the bread, my nigga, watch me rise
I'm watchin' niggas analyze me, how you protectin' me?
But made this whole plan to fry me?
Since the event, you never called me but you can't deny me
If you got shot from behind, how can you identify me?
It's funny how you got these lil' fufu, four plaque, lil' ju-ju niggas talkin' Zulu
I coulda made the shooters make a movie like it's Hulu
But who's these new niggas, talkin', boppin' and poppin' shit
But got less than four accomplishments? I got way more to lose than you do
Uh, watchin' the industry try and ho you
Asian Doll talkin', but shawty, I don't know you
I never met you, nor have I heard a song
And nor have I seen billboards
See your name in any cert or song from out your catalog
Oop, the hat is off
Behind that tatted skin, you battered with scattered scars
But I still respect and help you
Just don't treat me like you see me out in public
And I said, "Fuck it," and tried to disrespect you
JoJo, that was a bozo move
You tryna take me off a song that got you the most views
Got mad love for you, though, your label, they confused
They spent fifty on my feature, they fifty K in the lose right now, yeah
Nigga, play me, nigga, play me 'til the day I get to save me
I'm watchin' mad face and y'all niggas is movin' shady
Delusional, like
Like how that 1942 from Kylie house still got you talkin' crazy
Fuck a hail or handshake from niggas
The past months, the energy been mad fake from niggas
But I'm lifted up, bring Saran Wrap, talents gifted up
And if I drop this shit for a second, I'm back to pick it up
Unapologetically, jumped inside a pool and Kylie's face was lookin' heavenly
And though I'm innocent, they got this picture painted heavily
I pray that God remember me, faith done turn all my situations to a melon tree
Uh, J.R. Smith, it's the pot that piss
And you the last cat that should talk about some shots that hit
'Cause your performance and percentage, player
Rollin', ridin' benches, nigga, I'm from the trenches, nigga
You the type to buy a chick a eighty inch and still won't get a inch up in her
Yeah, I'm at they head, sprayin' hard like a spritzer, nigga
Baggin' niggas' ex bitches off a Insta' picture
Toes rufflin' through the sand like a Kingston nigga
Yeah, contradictions in your lines
With domestic pride crimes, we still have yet to find mines
Any time I brought these bitches up, you stressed it five times
How you try to kill the cat and then forget them nine lives?
I know it so well, I know these niggas so well
Jealous feelings, niggas best at catchin' like they Odell
It's rap niggas out here tellin' Megan she should go tell
But she won't tell the truth 'cause I'll be kicked up in my hotel
When the spiteful live shiesty, it's real trife
You niggas playin' Instagram, I'm playin' real life
Think I'm finna talk about a open case just for some likes?
I promise we done worked too many nights
Please, talkin' nights, we worked on a wage, flippin', turn through the page
We got Bun B on live sayin' I should burn in a cage
In these times of Black lives, he sayin' I should turn to a slave
If C pmiP heard that, then my nigga would have a rage right now
No diss to Pimp and Bun, but you made "Big Pimpin'," son
Pourin' champagne on women faces while they flick they tongue
I'm too young to give you lessons, but I'd like to give you one
Please stay the fuck up out my case, I ain't convicted, son
Chance the Rapp.. (Mmm, mmm), too irrelevant
I replaced his line with, "My chain lookin' Heaven-sent"
Next line, next line, 'cause momma always told me, "Don't you chew that food unless you would eat that shit for a next time"
I made too much money with Roc Nation
For niggas to be thinkin' I can't correlate the fact that it's only niggas out your roster hatin'
Contemplatin' these thoughts in my head
Like, "How the fuck these niggas callin' me, threatenin' me not to make no statements?"
Huh, the nerve nowadays
I'm hittin' certain niggas with the swerve nowadays
Gimme one DreamDoll hit record (Mmm), I'll wait
Ayy, Masika, this your chance, you in every Twitter debate
And every Shade Room comment like common sense ain't common sense
Like we be needin' your two cents and all your vents
Fakin' a kidnappin' for your OnlyFans
And tryna front like missin' kids was your intent
If that's the type of shit you teachin' Khari, then you should sit in a pen'
And watch people disagree in the end
You try to make it facts, but it's a L-I-E in the end
Oh, it ain't funny when it's your turn
When spectators got they lighters out with gasoline and wantin' yo' burn
Fuck a caption, this is facts with no cappin'
When Michael Jackson, Prince got they masters back, what happened?
Tory Lanez got his masters back just now and look what happened?
And Chris Brown, a Black man that changed his life for the right
And still, Black Twitter findin' ways to tear him down and bring him back in
A rapper catch a domestic, y'all start to talk that action
I feel like Famous Amos after all that happened
They want the downfall of every Black man, but I ain't goin'

[Outro: Yoko Gold & Tory Lanez]
They can't stop me, they can't stop, mmm
They can't stop me, they can't stop
They can't stop me, they can't stop, mmm
They can't stop me, they can't stop
It's like, it's like, you gotta take into account
Most of these niggas got my number, like
You coulda called me, like
You know what I'm sayin', likeIn the most sincere way, you coulda asked, like, nigga, like, "What happened? Did you do it?"
You know, even that woulda been straight to me, you know what I'm sayin', like
I guess I'm just different
But it's all good, nigga, I'ma continue to shine
You niggas could never stop me, nigga
You'll never put my back against the motherfuckin' wall, nigga
As long as my toes in the sand on God's green Earth, nigga
I wear the crown, shinin' notoriously and gloriously
I'm on a whole 'nother set of time, nigga, Super Saiyan five, nigga
Come out swingin', like Broly, you niggas'll never stop me, nigga
'Cause every time y'all niggas throw somethin' at me, nigga
I just keep risin', I never stop, I never back down, nigga
Back to the wall, I stand tall, nigga
Forever Umbrella, uh, uh, Tory, Canada
They can't stop me, they can't stop, mmm
They can't stop me, they can't stop
They can't stop me, they can't stop, mmm
They can't stop me, they can't stop

[Verse 1]
Kicked up with some new chick, got her pedi
Do my exes wrong when I get petty
Just tryna pay my rent and get this fetty
All I'm tryna do is hold it steady
Women on they jetski, they just wanna get me
Catch a nigga slippin', wanna get me
Rollin' through the city where the skinny niggas die, uh
Burner on my side, uh
Ain't nobody did it, where I'm from it's on my ex, it was to try
Try, young nigga, just try
Money comin' in, no, momma, don't cry
I know that we broke now but God don't lie
Ever been so broke that all you can do is cry?
Momma wipe the tears from her еyes
Momma can't do it, no, momma just died
Now I'm on the wrong path, chromе .45
Trippin' off this chick that I was lovin' 'til she lied
Broke in Mickey D's so we had to split some fries
Toonie Tuesday, they the only reason we survive
I'm from Flower City where them boys'll do you grimey
Caught up in this life, I'm tryna leave this shit behind me
Things can change for the worse
I done been through it all, been through the dirt
Hurt a lotta people in the times I was hurt
Now I work a triple shift for y'all to make sure it was worth it
Sit back and watch me fly, my nigga, watch me fly
Made it out the trenches, I was sittin' on the side
You can see it in my eyes, we gon' win, I never lied

[Bridge]
Yeah, ayy
Said I came up from the trenches, I was sittin' on the side
You can see it in my eyes, we gon' win, I never lied
Yeah, yeah
And ain't nobody ever seen a nigga from my side
Out the trenches tryna slide, tryna get it and I'm winnin' so I swear I never lied

[Verse 2]
Kiss you on your neck, say, "Everything is great"
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facin' eight
Can't believe she played the witness tryna make them statements
Grace of God, you know the truth, so I'm gon' beat them cases
I would never put my hands on a woman, dawg
I would never let it blam on a woman, dawg
'Cause if you know me, then you know just how I'm comin', dawg
'Cause I done worked to hard to throw this out for anyone of y'all
I came from seein' niggas on sight
Back to back Backwoods on them long nights
Even when my niggas wrong, say they alright
If they gon' lock me up because she lyin' then
Make sure my kid is alright, make sure my chick is alright
And make sure y'all sell these niggas
All my written records that I did in case we face them long nights
In case we face them hard nights, like these
She the only chick I fucked that ever did me this low
But, baby, out of code, I don't bend, break or fold
I know God got me, I ain't trippin' off these hoes
Niggas show they colors now I'm only with the bros
I'm only with the bros
Shawty actin' like she don't respect a real nigga
Then they wonder why I don't trust these hoes, no

[Chorus]
Slimmy, Queen to my slimmy
If it means I won't be here, from dying for your love, would you forgive me?
I feel at home in the kitty
Lay my head all on your stomach while you wear that Fenty, ayy
My thuggy, love me, love me
Give me cuddles, hold me snuggy
Don't you dub me, I just picked you up from Munchie's
Lookin' lovely, girl, I need you like a hustler gon' need his druggy

[Verse 1]
I get jaded feeling lonely, come and hold me
I need someone that really know me, and girl, you know me
Lay you down and let me stroke you slowly
But you told me sit it back inside that car while I was driving, and you did it lowkey, ayy

[Chorus]
Slimmy, Queen to my slimmy
If it means I won't be here, from dying for your love, would you forgive me?
I feel at home in the kitty
Lay my head all on your stomach while you wear that Fenty, ayy
My thuggy, love me, love me
Give me cuddles, hold me snugly
Don't you dub me, I just picked you up from Munchie's
Lookin' lovely, girl I need you like a hustler gon' need his druggy, ayy

[Verse 2]
I fumble, try to rumble
Takin' shots to make her stumble
1942 all on the deck soon as you come through
One-two, one-two
If it's ever goin' down, you know who you can run to, yeah
My thugga, cocoa butter
That's my crime, that's my mob, that's my knuck-or-bucker
We get faded walkin' through the house or stutter-stutter
Fall inside your sheets and fall inside your undercover, uh

[Chorus]
Slimmy, Queen to my slimmy
If it means I won't be here, from dying for your love, would you forgive me?
I feel at home in the kitty
Lay my head all on your stomach while you wear that Fenty, ayy
My thuggy, love me, love me
Give me cuddles, hold me snuggy
Don't you dub me, I just picked you up from Munchie's
Lookin' lovely, girl, I need you like a hustler gon' need his druggy

[Verse 3]
Look
We ain't talked in a long minute
Shit we used to do was authentic
Why we had to put our hearts in it?
Love came, put some scars in it
Feelings change, put some darts in it
Heart is changin', left me sharp-witted
Left the bike and left the bar spinnin'
Everybody play they parts in it
Justin dropped you straight into the crib
He be lowkey hatin' on the kid
You and Munchie drunk inside a ally
Been anticipatin' from the telly
Walked in the penthouse ready
Walked in the penthouse wavy
Finna put his dick off in her belly
Ride me like a motherfuckin' lady
House call to Jordyn Woods' house
Knocked out and woke up on the couch
Woke back and drove to your crib
This time I just know what it is
Next time the pool with you and Kylie
Hoped in it coolin', nigga wilin'
She was lookin' like a fuckin' angel
Lookin' like a baby in a manger
Hop step, went to the car
(Motherfucker, but, bitch, you got me fucked up)
Me and Kylie still off in the pool
We just chillin', kickin' shit, was cool
Both of us didn't know you was trippin'
Even though I got a crush on Kylie, I woulda left with you if I knew you was dippin' for the simple reason
You invited me but I can't act like shawty didn't excite me
I had took a wrong turn that-night
But not the turn that everybody think
I wasn't the wrong one that night, you was just too drunk to even see it
Wasn't anticipatin', I'd never put you in no situation
I've never even had an argument with ya
A conversation is all I'm bargainin' with ya
'Cause you was my nigga for real
And if you can agree, then you owe me that
Our mothers would tell us to do the right thing, and it's friendship, my nigga, you told me that
So even when niggas is comin' at me on they Twitter and Insta, I'm over that
'Cause what's a couple months of memes of me, if it means, I'm gon' get my homie back?
Fuck it, let's talk about it
Do you think anybody else inside of the business
That know they ain't did it would sit here and listen to critics
While niggas is trippin' and bashin' me?
Out here attackin' me, actually
Only reason why I let 'em do it, is 'cause I figured that you would've called a nigga
But look it's been over two months and all you did was stall, my nigga
The drama is bigger than ever
I thought that we both were bigger than that
Yeah, and the shit that I did, it was wack
But you don't get your nigga back like that
Just listen to Jigga on that one track
Song cryin' while it play in the back
I never cared to be that nigga in your fame shawty, I was playin' it back
We never had a thing, when we met each other, it was never a thing like that
Spendin' this time's what made us attached
Spendin' my time's what made you react
I'm only human, I gotta be real, and tell you, that the pain done came with that
Even the feelin' is strange at that
How you gon' up and just change the facts?

[Outro]
Hard to find your love (Find your love, baby)
When you walked away (When you are)
When I sleep, the thoughts of you don't stay away, no
Lost to love, what's up, babe? (Lost in love was somethin', baby)
I was finally free (Free)
The thoughts of you made it stay away, no

[Intro]
Can't nobody stop me
Can't nobody stop me
Yeah, I'll never let y'all niggas stop me
Look

[Verse]
We just lost Chadwick Boseman to cancer, colon
2020 quarantine, who know the plan his hand was holdin'?
The Black man stand for culture
The white man gave us cancel culture
And God bless the man you lay your hands up over
You gave me the keys, but see, the devil's like a tenet that won't hand 'em over
Angels still protect the neck, I laid and slang it over
Niggas ramble just to cancel Tory, they say my plan is over
God's plan can't bе over when the flow is still cold
As a man stuck in thе snow with his hands fold out in Manitoba
Camera catchin' still, stashin' numbers in my cannon holder
Tony Danza stance, still poppin' out the candy rover
Two sides to everythin', we bandin' over
What is all the slander over?
Oh, let's deport Tory for a story we don't know
But still got our necks out and hands up over
On my feed and timeline, there's niggas throwin' temper tantrums on 'em
Me, I just handle all 'em
Cut and throw a bandage on 'em
Stars playin' games, but Tory's never ashamed
'Cause if I did what they sayin', I'd probably would say the same
I would call me, "Bitch ass nigga," "Fuck boy" and everythin'
I just thought y'all hear my story before you thought I let that bang
But when the friends change, the story change
I just never thought that you would turn this to a Tory thing
I just never thought that you would turn this to a glory game
Once upon a time
My rap friends would never switch up they numbers on Tory Lanez
In the midst of the warrant things
I still ain't been convicted of shit, but they wanna bang
These the same niggas ridin' my dick on the Quarantine Radio
Crazy flow for my hoes that order name brand, poppin' imported things, I'm here
I refuse to be the poster boy for Black women unprotected
My mama Black, my sister Black
My baby mama Black, so how the fuck I'm unaffected?
Black women fueled my whole career for years
So don't make me some type of tear and unperfection
Love every color, every shape, size, and section
So I never left no one rejected
Yeah, I'm not perfect when you cut me up in sections
I got blunt objections
But if you teach me, I can work with lessons
Plus I'm real ill, we can chill, light a Dutch and burn the herbal essence
Don't tear me down, just lift me up and help me learn them lessons
Help a nigga learn them blessings
Help me more to understand your real plan is worth the stresses
That's the way to learn protection
That's the way to learn progression
Take your man to therapy, check on his mental health before you burn aggression
None of us deserve depression
None of this is worth the stressin'
It's just drama mixed with the trauma of curve and rejection
I get stuck in some evil thoughts, need words of correction
I start movin' too fast, I start burnin' my blessings
I go to interviews, niggas talkin', I'm curvin' they questions
Turnin' they table, I'm in they face and they heard I was reppin'
I'm on top on the world (World)
And God got me, so I'm poppin' on top of yo' girl
Stop light stoppin' yo' girl
They thought this wouldn't stop me, I still hot as a churro
I'm still stayin' stronger than black hair locked in a curl
I'm on the block and I'm thorough
Because I'm strong and plus I'm focused and I am the coldest
And any rapper in my position under this much pressure would've told on his open case and folded
It's kinda hard to tell yo' all and not be quoted in the court of law, yeah

[Outro]
Can't nobody stop me
Can't nobody stop me, oh

[Verse 1]
We fell in love too fast
And then we watched it all crash
Sent chills down my heart and my spine (Yeah-yeah)
But I still want you to be mine

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I underestimated anything you did for me, yeah
It's 'cause I didn't know, 'cause I didn't know, 'cause I didn't know
That love could feel this good
If I could rewind time, needa make you mine
You know if I could then I would, yeah-yeah-yeah (Woo)
You know I want you back, I want you back (Woo)
'Cause who gon' make me feel this way?

[Chorus]
I want you back
I want you back, yeah-yeah
You know I feel, oh, yes, it's real
I don't know nothin' that can make you feel the way I feel about you
Ooh-yeah
Ooh-yeah, ha-uh
Ooh-yeah, ha
Ooh-yeah, ha-uh

[Verse 2]
We felt the rush so fast
So fast that we could not last
Felt like someone took my cove (Yeah-yeah)
You showed me the true meaning of real love

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I underestimated anything you did for me, yeah
It's 'cause I didn't know, 'cause I didn't know, 'cause I didn't know
That love could feel this good
If I could rewind time, needa make you mine
You know if I could then I would, yeah-yeah-yeah (Woo)
You know I want you back, I want you back (Woo)
'Cause who gon' make me feel this way?

[Chorus]
I want you back
I want you back, yeah-yeah
You know I feel, oh, yes, it's real
I don't know nothin' that can make you feel the way I feel about you
Ooh-yeah
Ooh-yeah, uh
Ooh-yeah, ha
Ooh-yeah, ha-uh

[Intro]
Break your love
I never meant to break your love
Break your love
I never meant to break your love

[Verse 1]
Got love for everyone in the business
But everyone in my business
Tell me, how should I talk when everyone is a witness?
And every slur out your mouth can turn into someone's sentence
That turn into somethin' later, that turn into somethin' vicious
And vicious niggas is after yo' timе, turnin' yo' switches
Your friends swervin' yo' bitchеs and then burnin' your bridges
You stuck and severed in thoughts of when it's all gonna end
When the ending's harder than thoughts
Or when it starts, it begins
Nobody wins when the family feud
Or when the family news turns into somethin' that no one from the family choose
Or when you plan to choose it, it's a dub for the feat
When they play they move
When the plans change and you plan to expand, pannin' the views
And these R&B singer women you called, all your friends choose
Kehlani hops on the news like it was somethin' to prove
Like me and her wasn't cool when I been friends with you for six years
Plus, plus the crew and we can Google picture proof
Got my phone number too, you coulda called me
But you movin' like we ain't even crew, and you'd not rather hear my views?
We used to phone talk late about exes and all our pools
I held your newborn in my arms, tell me how we aren't cool
Instead, you went to Twitter Shade Room to focus on your views
You was the quickest one to take me off records and set the mood
And now you got these little garbage artists talkin' like they takin' me off somethin'
That's gon' harm me, your label paid me already, dude
But KK, back to you, let me tell you who's
How to move, this is what you do
If you wanna take that stance, then that's cool
But we gon' do this with some rules
Ayy, JoJo, I need you to take notes too
Don't take me off the deluxe album that no one gives a fuck about
Take me off the original too
'Cause when I'm scrollin' through this Spotify playlist
See me my name both in y'all top five pages
It just feels a little unsincere, hmm?
Or maybe I refuse, am I trippin' and confused?
Y'all could have took me off the album but have still have yet to do?
Ayy, nah, maybe it's the truth
Got the numbers and the proof
'Cause with both of y'all combined, I gave y'all forty million views
Y'all can't lose
What do you do when your friends lookin' at you sideways?
I can't even tell 'em what happened because of my case
You can't even trust in nobody 'cause they might try face
All the G's tellin' you, OG, this isn't my day
Y'all can dub and hurt me but I'm fueled by a God
Tender love and mercy, devil tryna work me
But I pop up in the scene, chocolate car, color Hershey
It's some niggas that I lent money to that never imbursed me

[Pre-Chorus]
I had many visions of this time, made decisions for the prime
Future thinkin' how I'm speakin' on the past like, "What a time"
Once upon a time, was just a kid that loved to rhyme
And now the fame is bittersweet, I take the cake that come with mine, Tory

[Chorus]
Is it worth it?
When everything that's bittersweet isn't perfect
Lookin' beyond the surface
And I can see the greatest go away
I never meant to break your heart
(I never meant to break your heart, no)
I never meant to break your heart, no
Look

[Verse 2]
I know I'm swingin' with the excalibur sword, calibers in the drawer
Copped me a brand new Cullinan, calendars lookin' for him
My balance fully attended, two talents full on the floor
My palace is full of awards, my shower is like the Falls
I'm serious
And my aim is never beef with my peers
When niggas careers like the game with the seat with the chairs
When the music goes off and you left sittin', seein' who's there
Yeah, niggas don't even compare
It hurt to say them words 'bout Roc Nation management
'Cause Jigga whole career, I've been a fan of it
And I'm just pissed 'bout how these niggas handled it
I worked for this for years
And outta nowhere, here comes Jill tryna come smear campaign and damage it
Like she hit me with the "Oh, well"
But I know this so well
I'm colder than a polar bear's toenail in my hotel
Got thick strippers gettin' motorboated in a motel
Made videos and TMZ'll pay me just to go sell
I don't like to do this, y'all just act like I ain't human
Been two months and seein' me on memes and I ain't suppose to do shit?
Oh, I get it, y'all think I'm stupid
I'm supposed to lose to these lies
Tellin' rumor and sellin' niggas that feudin'
And talkin' to GOAT, never with they chest but all with they throat
It's like you can only trust these niggas as far as you throw
As far as it goes, the check, cards in the wallet
Console still got these bitches tryna swallow me whole
You know me
Shawty said I can't be canceled 'cause I'm far too handsome
I hopped up out that yellow Lamb', her man start a tantrum
The bands fallin' over me just like a starvin' dancer
But take that up with the man who decide to harness answers
I know God got me, I know God got me
The car frame in two lanes, it's a wide body
She'd rather fuck me in her brain but try to side eye me
Them Flower City niggas with me, homie, why try me?
Crack the seal on the weed, still on the speed
Watch critics create meme with zero chill on my feed
They never expected me to react actually
But fuck it, that's that nigga, I'm back to bein' me
But I wonder if we'll talk again
Wonder if we'll run up on Runyon Canyon at 9 o'clock at night and take that walk again
Even if you don't, I still consider you my friend
And the greater that it came, is still the bigger that it is
In my darkest days, sittin' at the pillar countin' scrilla
Chinchilla jacket like Tony at the villa
Not only am I richer than these fuck ass rap niggas, I'm realer
And I'm down to put that work in until you feel him

[Pre-Chorus]
Shotta had many visions of this time, made decisions for the prime
Future thinkin' how I'm speakin' on the past like, "What a time"
Once upon a time, was just a kid that loved to rhyme
Now the fame is bittersweet, I take the cake that come with mine, Tory

[Chorus]
Is it worth it?
When everything that's bittersweet isn't perfect
Lookin' beyond the surface
And I can see the greatest flow away
I never meant to break your heart
(I never meant to break your heart, no)
I never meant to break your heart, no

[Outro]
Yo, why yuh come disrespect up mon?
Unnu cyan jus' dance?

[Verse 1]
It's so, it's so easy
Living your life the way you wanna
It's so, it's so easy
Spending your nights the way you wanna (Ayy)
And I know that you got no one that does you like I do
And who you got right now can't fuck you like I do
And you got that type that I seem to like
And it feels like I missed my chance
So let's dance, one more time

[Chorus]
'Cause you might think you need someone brand new
Don't front like I'm not fucked up over you
You lie so much to me, don't know the truth
I'm stressing, yeah, I'm fucked up over you
I'm stressing, yeah, I'm fucked up over you
I'm stressing, yeah, I'm fucked up over you-ooh-ooh
I'm strеssing, yeah, I'm fucked up over you
And you, uh

[Verse 2]
You might just think that you need somеone new
I fell in love with the thought of somethin' true
I pump my brakes and tried to play it cool
Infatuated, I waited for you-ooh
Yeah, holding on this stance
Things I should've said
Thoughts racing in my head
You know what I did
Got nervous, so I fled
I left it where I left it
Won't leave your side again

[Chorus]
'Cause you might think you need someone brand new
Don't front like I'm not fucked up over you
You lie so much to me, don't know the truth
I'm stressing, yeah, I'm fucked up over you
I'm stressing, yeah, I'm fucked up over you
I'm stressing, yeah, I'm fucked up over you-ooh-ooh
I'm stressing, yeah, I'm fucked up over you
And you, uh

[Verse]
Dance 'til the mornin' and clock out
Strippers stealin' money from your locker
I've got some bitches and some options
But you the one, I always pop out for you
Left side the bar, I'm out there fuckin' faded
Ain't anticipate the cab ride home, but we fuckin' made it
Sippin' '42, and Hennessy, and fuckin' Jägers
That's the reason why we got so dangerous
I fuckin' hate you, I mean, I love you but I fuckin' hate you
But why the fuck you make me feel like we'd be fuckin' major?
I never meant to make you feel like I would underrate you
I'll be sittin' by this table, I'm so unstable
Somewhere by the bleachers, smokin', puffin' weed
Teachers never gave a fuck, they was paid to show up and leave
Marijuana on my sleeve
JV, practiced varsity, I didn't make it on the team
So I started sellin' nicks and dimes and all these twenty beams
Anyting or anyting, dub sacks and duffle bags
Hennessy and triple beams
Shawty said she fuckin' love me, came around and sold me dreams
I was skatin' on a thot like a fuckin' rollin' rink
Sellin' dope like it's my only thing
If we get caught, that chromie swing if crodie sing
Lawyer fightin' cases for the team, we got forty rings
Champagne by the cases, I came in with like forty tings
I split the scene like the splits in my jeans
Split in my seams, I'm gettin' money, ain't it?
No one was there to hold you down when it was cloudy
But they show up when it's sunny, ain't it?
And it pours rain on my umbrella but this one I got's forever, oh
I hope it was fun, me and yo' best friend, we had a thing but that was something
She real as fuck, you could've told her but you dead wrong
Instead you left her out for dead, girl, is your head gone?
Fuck is the loyalty?
Tell me, who the fuck taught you your loyalty?
How you try to fuck me and then foil me?
Poppin' up in places that you know I'll be
I done kept this shit so real, you owe me
I done kept this shit so real, you know me
How you movin' like I'm not the only?
How you movin' like I left you lonely?
How you movin' like I'm not the homie?

[Outro]
Yes, I thought you would've been more loyal, loyal to me
Yes, I thought you would've been more loyal, loyal to me
And I told everyone that you were loyal, now the joke's on me
The joke's on me, I told everyone that you were the one, the joke's on me
And you let them laugh, makin' jokes of me
I told my exes I'd make you my girl, now the joke is on me
I told the people I love that you were the one, now the joke is on me
Oh, I'm ashamed, joke's on me
Oh, I'm ashamed, the joke's on me
Oh

[Intro]
Care, yes I do
You know I care
You know I care

[Verse 1]
Uh, beautiful Black child, let's have a conversation
Let's skip the contemplation
Let's talk more about moderation and modern-day shit
Let's learn Black love, take it back by the basis
We ain't even gotta fake shit
Beautiful Black women, help me to make you stronger
Help me to make me stronger
Help though it takes me as long as clock on the wall to get my act right and make me call hеr
Help me to make you bеtter, help me, I'll take you farther
All these insecurities play on your mind currently
Dealt with pain durably
And here I come inside of the bathroom, makin' it worse, blamin' you for the pain hurtin' me
We need God urgently
Lately, I've been workin' your feelings while on my workin' spree
Lately, I've been hurtin' your feelings, meanwhile, it's hurtin' me
Maybe I've been all in my feelings, tryna get back to you
Lately, I've been mindin' my bidness, tryna get back at you
Help me more to understand, it's traumas in my past that make me talk loud and lash at you
Sorry for the times my attitude mix with the status too
We've been smokin' weed and gettin' drunk, and mixin' bad in too
Fuck all that status, I'm tryna get back the back with you
Beautiful Black mothers, you raised so many of us
They build abortion clinics by your house to take you from us
Beautiful Black fathers, I know your back against the wall
You goin' hard but don't you let these people take you from us
We thuggin' hard, niggas die in the summer
Who gon' supply for our sons? Who gon' supply for our daughters?
We can't leave it to section eight to provide like a father
We can't leave our kids with these people decidin' the order
Last time I checked, nigga, we was decidin' the culture
Last time I checked, nigga, that's what decided the order
Last time I checked, nigga, we was controllin' the trend
Same one that got white kids Tik-Tokin' and woah'ing again
People been stealin' from us in blind sight
White people payin' Black blogs to damage us and self-damage us on all online sites
Shade Room, y'all ain't hidin', twenty million followers
To Black folk, you gotta be more positive
Even though your investor's a white guy named Bryce Robins
Is it worth explorin' the Black culture for the measly a hunnid thousand dollars?
Look Angelica, it ain't worth it
You a Black queen that push your scene above the surface
And we love you for that active drive and purpose
But it's time you take that hunnid thou', reverse it
Work it back into our communities, rehabilitate the unity
Young Black women shinin', don't be confused by my lines
Before they up and tryna take 'em and reconfuse as some hatred, listen

[Pre-Chorus]
My Black child, I'm sayin' this 'cause I love you
But love ain't come with the lessons that's gon' live life all above you
The police gon' hate up on you, the government's never for you
But you can rise all above it as long as you keep your lovin'
I say this just 'cause I care

[Chorus]
And I care for you, for you
And I'm there for you, I'm there for you
And I care for you, for you
And I'm there for you, I'm there for you

[Verse 2]
I was never good in school but smart enough to see the signs
Behind the fuckery and lies of the system and how they try
The grand plan is to separate us, tear us down, conquer divide
The main plan was to have the Black man silenced
And though, of course, we used our voice to override it
They influenced us by usin' niggas our color to talk 'bout drugs and violence and signed 'em
They made Black women talk more sex and less what they mind is
'80s all through the the '90s, like who the fuck is behind this?
You awake to remind us, I equate to remind ya
Business, they told you mind ya, listen and you ain't find your
Self inside of this war, the devil dive in your door
My Black skinned, Christians, know the devil pry at your more
My beautiful Black daughters, the ones who lash out in class
Out of anger, that angle the fact they had no fuckin' fathers
Or the ones they had would touch they daughters
We never knew 'cause they was quiet in school
No one supports them and the affection only came from fuck niggas that love in portions
Or some older cats that never made love, to fuck they forced it
But it's the way that love was taught to you, shawty
Nobody taught it, you gotta know that ain't your fault
You tryna tear your mind comparin' yourself to someone who's brought up in family genes
That means mother, father is present on family tree
That mean you don't take all the blame 'cause they wasn't there
That just mean you a Black queen whose life wasn't fair
But God give unfair to the favorites
None heirs to the hatred
Tests that bring you faith when it's unclear what the fate is
People talk 'bout your untamed hair, hey, it's my favorite
Dark skin and light skin, and love you for what your shade is
It's Black
Unapologetic and Afrocentric
With enough curve and ass for me to not have to mention all of my afro-hension
With natural hair, you fierce, they told you had to have extentions
That was cappin' past the fiction
Shawty, you a whole ninth inning, championship, when you batting that shit up past the fences
You know I'm past attentive, let's make some last decisions

[Pre-Chorus]
My Black child, I'm sayin' this 'cause I love you
But love ain't come with the lessons that's gon' live life all above you
The police gon' hate up on you, the government's never for you
But you can rise all above it as long as you keep your lovin'
I say this just 'cause I care

[Chorus]
And I care for you, for you
And I'm there for you, I'm there for you
And I care for you, for you
And I'm there for you, I'm there for you

[Intro]
That's where you niggas got it fucked up and twisted
They ain't scared about just a regular Black man in America, yeah, they fear that nigga too
But they fear the independent man
They fear the nigga who goes out and gets his
They fear the nigga that goes out and says, "I ain't takin' no for an answer"
They fear the man that says, "I'ma do it, I'ma make the corporation"
They fear the man that thinks above the employee position
They fear the man that wants to be a boss
They fear the Black man in America who's accomplished
When you step outside, when you're in that Benz, when you're in that Bentley
And you shine and you got your ice and your jewelry on
They fear you, nigga
Niggas gotta be stupid to not see what's goin' on out here
They tryna black out every single successful Black man in America

[Verse 1]
If bein' Black is bein culture, what's the cancel culture?
Sound like some white shit them niggas planted on us
The cops killin' only heroes on the cam recorders
When major corporations ramblin' 'bout niggas on Twitter
When all they did was put BLM in they handles for us
Open your eyes, they ain't standin' for us
It's 2020, been a year, God planned it for us
A lot of things he got planning for us
I'm in the ring like Rocky
I got a shot type Aki, but it'll steal a score
What's everybody in they feelings for?
It's 'cause I'm aimin' at the ceilin' floor
Still poppin' on these niggas, waitin' while they slither
When I'm comin', they can feel it more
The blogs only want my words just to switch 'em more
What do you do when the court lawyers is tellin' you not to talk
And as soon you don't, you playin' the villain for it?
You got a lot of feelings still in store
I'm still hearin' stories, that nigga talkin' 'bout Tory is over
I'm God's child, I'm one of his most glorious soldiers
I'm workin' at the old man's, custodian, quota
I'm notorious for the stories of overcomin' the poorest of situations and comin' out glorious from 'em
Niggas taught us to sell dope when you bored in the summer
He was lackin' a couple cast, then got caught in the summer
Pulled up on him, they started clappin' his dome in the summer, no wonder
That was my dawg, I used to fuck with him hard
He pull up to the tour bus with the dawgs
He used to tell me I'm a Don and I'm a prince and how I come with the charm
And laughed back and say, "Don't fuck with no frauds"
'Lil cuz, you a star
Take me to the back, bust a cigar
Told me rap and stop hustlin' raw, but I was doublin' hard
Next step, cop comin' in car and you was always there to bust up a charge
Shit just fucked with me hard
Now it's pannin' out, news cameras standin' out
Wrongfully accused but on the news is what the man about
Even my own friends hands wasn't out
Tell me, what that's all about?
Fame got us fallin' out

[Verse 2]
Niggas hated on me, made me grind harder
It's gon' be people that gon' switch when the times harder
The door's open for a short line of niggas and it figures
It's the time, I ain't tryna make my line longer
I made my mind stronger
I made my heart colder
I work the best when my back was up at the wall for ya
I'm goin' through some changes, close friends turn to strangers
I'm tryna turn the pages even though it's anger in my heart for ya
Yeah, more important than ever
The snow is fallin' on my brain in the coldest December
I tell a lie like, "Yo, I'm fine," but I'm holdin' together
I'm back on pace for the race
I'm at a rate where niggas just start blowin' this cheddar so damn hard that I part ways
With both of my hoes and had 'em both trippin' out and goin' together
For all the ones that know me better, you know I'm fed up
The only way to hold a set up is to know a set up

[Verse 3]
I don't like to do this, y'all just act like I ain’t human
Please don't listen to the rumors that they try alludin'
I've never hit no woman, why the fuck would I just do this?
This be that dark label shit, them niggas tryna do me
I know the secrets and I know the fuckery
And they don't want me to say nothin' so they tryna shut— (Uh)
But God the only one in line to judge me
The other side and kind is ugly and they tryna fuck me, yeah
What happened to the times of helpin' self?
When we dehumanizin' celebrities with mental health
Don't know the story, so we make one and upset ourselves
So nowadays, I feel the pain from certain niggas I ain't never felt
We just marched in unity about us bein' brothers
And y'all ain't even hear my side, that's how we bein' brothers?
It's kinda crazy, white folks ain't even sayin' nothin'
Only celebs I'm seein' hatin' are my same color
Get it together, we gotta get it together
My nigga, we Black skin and we gotta live it together
Fuck how you feelin' about me, we got a mission together
You gotta listen, 'cause God, he gotta get his endeavor, preach
Tory, you in this situation, not because he's hatin'
He's usin' Megan as a vessel and a test of faith and
Even when you at the bottom, it's when he makes his way in
God, thank you for turnin' me into a demonstration

[Intro: Lauryn Hill]
Yo, yo (Check our situation)
My men and my women
(Yo) Yo, yo (Check our situation)
My men and my wom–

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You need somethin' unexpected, some form of weapon
You ask him to feel protected, and still feel protected
Just one time for the record, just one time for the record
Don't agree with the message, don't agree with the methods

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, it's too early
What the hell you doin' wakin' me up at 5:30?
Why the hell are you worried?
Play somethin' that is very, very vibe-worthy
I don't know want my mind alerting
People sayin' tweetin' gonna make you die early
How 'bout have my heart hurtin'?
Hold it all inside, that could make you die early
Go on and get your best attorney
Something's there, feel it when I heard it
Just release the spirit, let it flow though
How these **** leaving now with one leg like Flo-Jo?
Nail me to the cross with long nails, like Coko
Free Throat Coat for the throat goats
Even if I gotta do it solo, even if I gotta do it with no promo
I ain't got my point across
'Til we finally get across and pass the point
So there's a couple things that I gotta quote
Don't involve yourself in things you don't have to know
I ain't never question what you was askin' for
I gave you every single thing you was askin' for
I don't understand how anybody could ask for more
Got a list of even more, I just laugh it off
I be goin' through things I had to wrote
Celebrity drama that only Brad'll know
Too many family secrets, somebody passin' notes
Things I cried about, I found laughable
Lil' baby Jesus, ain't laughing, no
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know
The big man upstairs ain't laughin', no
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know

[Bridge: Buju Banton]
Now here we are
You know I'm not about it
Showed you my all
I let you into my thoughts

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow in love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow

[Interlude: Buju Banton]
Okay, I didn't throw a fit when you said you wanted to leave
I told you I loved you, but you didn't believe
You were too easily fooled, so easily deceived
By some dude who's more rather into greed
Played by your emotions, you were swamped by your needs
Told me, I didn't believe, you said I was out to deceive, ahaha
You said that I lie, how did I? I told you everything, didn't I?
But you just could not believe, man, I'm so peeved
Your friends all up in your head even when we're in bed
Your mind's elsewhere, and you say you care? Haha
I'm laughin' at you all, you think you got me? No, no
My back ain't against the wall (The wall, the wall, the wall, the wall, the wall)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light (Right on)
One last sparkle to follow
The strangest rhythm
Kept me up in my bed
In my ears
In my feet
That damn nightmare
Keeps visiting me
At the door
Police

Come over
Come over
Come over
Come over

I lay here wondering
If I am at the end
No recourse
Or relief
And these damn regrets
Keep eating at me
Eating at
My belief
So my
My midnight demons
Are clawing at me
I'll never outrun the past
My feet are aching
And I don't think Ill last
But there is no turning back
Come over
Come over
Come over
Come over

Come over
Come over
Come over
Come over

Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

[Chorus]
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

[Verse 2]
Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the timе when Earth shall be as one

[Chorus]
And I feel likе I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

[Post-Chorus]
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly

Quicker than a ray of light, then gone for
Someone else will be there
Through the endless years

She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe

And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light, she's flying
Quicker than a ray of light, I'm flying

Lyrics from Snippets

[Intro: Travis Scott, Pharrell Williams & The Weeknd]
Higher, higher (Uhh, yeah)
It's like standing in the ocean

[Verse: Kanye West]
People say I want world peace
Jerome's niece get shot in the dome-piece
...
I fucked your ex and sent a text out of respect
It was good sex, honorable mention to the neck
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse: Pusha T]
Arms are at three and nine
Knowin' that he is mine
Alien (Ooh), We about to fly out
Where we land?

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
If you wеre a boy
Then, girl, you'd understand
You need to stop listеnin' to your friends
Love, respect, and trust your man
So I go to clubs with the guys
And sometimes flirt with the girls
I should be able to roll out
As long as I'm comin' home to you
And give you the world

[Pre-Chorus: R Kelly]
But you're not a boy
So you don't have a clue, babe
How I work and pay the bills
How everything I do is for you
Hey, hey

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Chorus 2: Beyoncé (R. Kelly)]
If I were a boy (If I were a girl)
I would turn off my phone (I wouldn't play games)
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone
(Girl, you know that's wrong)
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home, to come home

[Post-Chorus: R. Kelly]
But you're not a boy
So you can't understand
You are not a perfect woman
And I am not a perfect man

[Chorus: Beyoncé & (R. Kelly)]
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts (And I know how you feel)
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed (Said I'm sorry)

[Bridge: Beyoncé & R. Kelly]
It's a little too late for you to come back
But I can't let you go, 'cause I'm too attached
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Outro: Beyoncé]
But you're just a boy

[Verse 1]
No (Don't say)
I'm not gonna turn my back on you
You know I'll never let you down, no way
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down, no way

[Pre-Chorus]
Try to tell you that it's all right
Ooh, I'm not playing
Can't you see what I am saying?
You are my religion

[Chorus]
To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me?
To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me?

[Verse 2]
No (Don't say)
I'm not gonna turn my back on you
You know I'll never let you down, no way
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down, no way

[Pre-Chorus]
Try to tell you that it's all right
Ooh, I'm not playing
Can't you see what I'm saying?
You are my religion

Try to tell you that it's all right
Ooh, I'm not playing
Can't you see what I'm saying?
You are my religion

[Chorus]
To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me?
To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me?

[Intro]
Ye-ah

[Verse 1]
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
I saw you dancing when it’s said and done
I saw you passing with your man, enough
I saw you kissing with your man, enough

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away

[Verse 2]
Scared of loving, I wasn’t man enough
Was scared of touching, when you get it on
I really do miss you, would you make it home?
I don’t want you searching, would you make it on?

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'll make you cry when I run away (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

Save your tears for another
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day

[Verse 3]
Scared of loving, I wasn’t man enough
Was scared of touching, when you gеt it on
I really do miss you, would you make it home?
I don’t want you sеarching, would you make it on?

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'll make you cry when I run away (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

Save your tears for another
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day

I don’t know why I run away...
I’ll make you cry when I run away

[Chorus]
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day

[Verse 1]
You came along when I needed a savior
Someone to pull me through somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been torn apart so many times
I've been hurt so many times before
So I'm counting on you now

[Chorus]
Somebody already broke my heart
Somebody already broke my heart

[Verse 2]
Here I am
So don't leave me stranded
On the end of a line
Hanging on the edge of a lie

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been torn apart so many times
I've been hurt so many times before
So be careful and bе kind

[Chorus]
Somebody already broke my hеart
If someone has to lose, I don't want to play
Somebody already broke my heart
No, no I can't go there again

[Verse 3]
You came along when I needed a savior
Someone to pull me through somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been torn apart so many times
I've been hurt so many times before

Somebody already broke my heart
If someone has to lose, I don't want to play
Somebody already broke my heart
No, no I can't go there again

[Intro]
I wish you could shelter me
I wish you could shelter me
I wish you could shelter me
I wish you could shelter me
I wish you could shelter me
I wish you could shelter me
I wish you could shelter me
I wish you could shelter me
I wish you could shelter me
Shelter me now

[Verse 1]
You shed a shadow on my life
Shed a shadow on a love
Took the shelter out of my life
Took the shelter of a lie

[Pre-Chorus]
I could see it in your restless eyes
(I could see it, I could see it)
The truth I was hiding
(I could see it, I could see it)
The truth you could not disguise
(I could see it, I could see it)

[Chorus]
But I never thought I'd see the day
I knew I'd need a miracle to make you stay
I knew I needed a miracle
And I never thought I'd see the day

[Verse 2]
You put a shadow on a love
Took a shelter of a lie
Took the shelter out of my life

[Outro]
I wish you could shelter me
Shelter me now
I need a miracle
And I never thought I'd see the day

[Verse 1]
There is a woman in Somalia
Scraping for pearls on the roadside
There's a force stronger than nature
Keeps her will alive
This is how she's dying
She's dying to survive
Don't know what she's made of
I would like to be that brave

[Chorus]
She cries to the heaven above
There is a stone in my heart
She lives a life she didn't choose
And it hurts like brand new shoes
Hurts like brand new shoes

[Verse 2]
There is a woman in Somalia
The sun gives her no mercy
The same sky we lay under
Burns her to the bone
Long as afternoon shadows
It's gonna take her to get home
Each grain carefully wrapped up
Pearls for her little girl

[Bridge]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Chorus]
She cries to the heaven above
There is a stone in my heart
She lives in a world she didn't choose
And it hurts like brand new shoes
Hurts like brand new shoes

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
She cries to the heaven above
There is a stone in my heart
She lives in a world she didn't choose
And it hurts like brand new shoes
Hurts like brand new shoes

[Outro]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Verse 1]
There is a woman in Somalia
Scraping for pearls on the roadside
There's a force stronger than nature
Keeps her will alive
This is how she's dying
She's dying to survive
Don't know what she's made of
I would like to be that brave

[Chorus]
She cries to the heaven above
There is a stone in my heart
She lives a life she didn't choose
And it hurts like brand new shoes
Hurts like brand new shoes

[Verse 2]
There is a woman in Somalia
The sun gives her no mercy
The same sky we lay under
Burns her to the bone
Long as afternoon shadows
It's gonna take her to get home
Each grain carefully wrapped up
Pearls for her little girl

[Bridge]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Chorus]
She cries to the heaven above
There is a stone in my heart
She lives in a world she didn't choose
And it hurts like brand new shoes
Hurts like brand new shoes

[Verse 1]
There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly led me to you
Look at the sky
It's the color of love
There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly came down from above
He led me to you
He led me to you

He built a bridge to your heart
All the way
How many tons of love inside?
I can’t say

When I was led to you
I knew you were the one for me
I swear the whole world could feel my heartbeat
When I lay eyes on you
I-I-I-I-I-I
You wrap me up in
The color of love

[Chorus]
You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me the kiss that's like
Kiss of life

[Verse 2]
Wasn't it clear
From the start
Look, the sky is full of love
Yeah, the sky is full of love

He built a bridge to your heart
All the way
How many tons of love inside?
I can’t say

[Chorus]
You gave me the kiss of life

[Spoken Intro]
He's laughing with another girl
And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes, making hearts ache
He’s loved in seven languages
Jewel box life, diamond nights and ruby lights
High in the sky
Heaven help him when he falls

[Verse 1]
Diamond life lover boy
He moves in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights

[Pre-Chorus]
No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
When sеntiment is left to chance
No placе to be ending but somewhere to start

[Chorus]
No need to ask
He's a smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator

[Post-Chorus]
Coast-to-coast, L.A. to Chicago: Western male
Across the North and South, to Key Largo: love for sale

[Verse 2]
Face to face, each classic case
We shadow box and double-cross
Yet need the chase

[Pre-Chorus]
A license to love, insurance to hold
Melts all your memories and change them to gold
His eyes are like angels; his heart is cold

[Chorus]
No need to ask
He's a smooth operator

A hat to call my home
A bag that won’t hold much
And a simple song to sing when I’m alone

And I don’t wanna live off crumbs and wait for love that never comes to get me

A hat to call my home
A bag that won’t hold much

Ooooooooooh (x2)

A hat to call my home
A bag that won’t hold much
A dog who lives the dream
Some booze that I can feel
A good day once a week

And it might go la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la (x2)

And I, kiss them clouds on them rainy days
And, smile for you when ya skies are gray
Babe, 'cause I'm a tear drop away from cryin'
And a few shots away from dyin'

Let it rain, let it rain on me?
While I cherish the air I breathe
I'm an angel, that can't soar, can't fly
And I imagine the Lord knows why

Spread love
And for those who can't take it
Stand up
Baby, we gonna make it
In the words of Marvin Gaye
War is not the answer
Oh, it's just those rainy days

I'm surprised to see your suitcase at the door
(I'm surprised, I'm surprised)
Remember the good times, don't you want some more?
(Don't you want it?)
It's not a perfect love, but I'll defend it

'Cause I believe that's what God intended now

[Chorus]
We got love too good to throw away

I can hear those words spoken as I stood
(As I stood)
Making bonds through love, if times are bad or good

Even the stars declare that you belong to me

[Chorus]
And we got love too good to throw away, oh oh, oh oh

Your intellect, whatever you choose
Check me out

Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary

[Verse 1]
The problem is for many years
I've lived my life publicly
So it's hard for me to find a man I trust
I really trust
And every time I find someone I like, gotta worry about
If it's really me that they see
And I thought you were the one, oh

Deep inside I wish that you could see
(Deep inside)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see

I don't have a lot of friends
And sometimes I have to wonder
Is it cash they see when they look at me?
'Cause they're lookin' for a ride that's free
So I made the choice to be
Good to those who are good to me
Don't judge me or think I'm bitter
For the evil does allow me to see I'm just Mary

[Bridge]
The car I drive, the clothes I wear
The diamonds, the furs, and the house
Don't make the woman
(See, ain't nothin' changed but the rain, and it goes along with it)
So I need someone to stand by me and supply my needs
And I'm just plain ol' Mary
(Why can't you love the person inside, and stop lookin' outside)

[Chorus]
Deep inside I wish that you could see

Deep inside I wish that you could see

(Deep inside I wish that...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
(I wish that they can see that I'm Mary, yeah)
Deep inside I wish that they could see
(Deep inside I wish that...)

[Bridge]
The car I drive, the clothes I wear
The diamonds, the furs, and the house
Don't make the woman
See, ain't nothin' changed but the rain, and it goes along with it
So, I need someone to stand by me and supply my needs
And I'm just plain ol' Mary
Why can't you love the person inside, and stop lookin' outside

[Chorus]
Deep inside I wish that they could see
(I said that I'm just Mary, yeah yeah)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
(All day, all night, I'm Mary, Mary, Mary)
Deep inside I wish that they could see
(Said I wish, and I wish, and I wish, and I wish...)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary (MJB, yeah)

I need, I need, I need someone
Why can't you love the person inside, and stop lookin' outside
The car I drive, the clothes I wear
The diamonds, the furs, and the house
Don't make the woman
All day, all night, I'm Mary, Mary, Mary, oh
So I need someone to stand by me and supply my needs
And I'm just plain ol' Mary
MJB, yeah
The car I drive, the clothes I wear
The diamonds, the furs, and the house
Don't make the woman
If I could give you something else
But I can't give you nothing but me all day and all night
I'm just Mary, Mary, Mary
It can't be the clothes or the car I drive
Nothin' matters more than being me
Nothin' means more to me than being me
I'm just Mary, Mary, ooh oh oh

[Chorus]
Deep inside I wish that you could see
(Said I wish, and I wish, I wish, I wish)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
(I wish that they could see that I'm just me)
(Come on, help me out)
Deep inside I wish that you could see
(Terry, help me out, help me)
That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary

[Outro]
Let these people know that I
I can't help 'cause my voice is raspy
I can't help it 'cause I'm just me

Just as all is born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be lovin' you always

Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
That last through forever

Couldn't make me be the past

And I'll be loving you always

[Chorus: Choir & Mary J. Blige]
Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Loving you until the ocean covers every mountain high

Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
(I'll be lovin' you forever)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that it's the day that I'm no more

[Bridge: George Michael & Mary J. Blige]

[Verse 1]
How can I love somebody else
If I can't love myself enough to know
When it's time
Time to let go
Sing

[Chorus]
All I really want (Yeah)
Is to be happy (Oh yeah)
And to find a love that's mine (Ooh)
It would be so sweet (Hey)
All I really want (Oh)
Is to be happy (I wanna be happy, yeah)
And to find a love that's mine (Yeah yeah)
It would be so sweet

[Verse 2]
I asked for a sign
From my sweet Lord above
I know the answer is in front of me, but when
You think you're in love
You only see what you wanna see
And all I see is me for you
And you for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I cannot hide the way I feel inside
(No, I don't know why)
I don't know why but every day I wanna cry
(Every day I wanna cry)
But if I give you one more try
To these rules, will you abide?
And if I mean anything to you
Would it make everything alright?

[Chorus]
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
(I said I wanna be happy)
All I really want
Is to be happy (Oh, I wanna be...)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

Is to be happy (Wanna be happy)
And to find a love that's mine (Yeah)
It would be so sweet
(It would be so sweet...)
All I really want (...if only we could be...)
Is to be happy (We can be happy)
And to find a love that's mine (I wanna be happy)
It would be so sweet

[Bridge]
I just wanna be so, so happy
But the answer lies in me
I do believe
That we can be happy
I said I wanna be happy, yeah yeah yeah
Now let it breathe
Life is too short to be tryin' to play some games
Now take some time and think about
If it's really worth losing me
Why must it be this way?
Why do you have to play with my mind
All the time?
Help me sing it

All I really want is for me to be happy
(Oh, just help me sing it)
All I really want is for me to be happy
(Yeah, yeah yeah)
All I really want is for me to be happy

Cause if we know this shit reversed you’d be at my casket in the front

I know you would (yeah)

But I’m just to misunderstood

And I had to leave them perckys alone for good cause they made me feel too good

I’m rollin woods, to kill the pain cause Ion feel the same
I know some niggas I knеw my whole life, and I’m feeling strange
Mеmber we said the money came, that we never would change
Now niggas that used to be at practice only one that come to the game

See the score, and the whores, and we adhere all the wars
But all the pain that I endured I gotta wear all these scars
When shorty said it’s love forever, I’m like yeah are you sure

FUCK EM
(Yeah)
I gotta keep my FN on me everyday now cause I don’t trust niggas I grew up with at the playground
I got up never told what they gon say now, I told my niggas stay down
Cause I heard they say they gon see me on the way down , when I’m really on the way up
I seen them told em stay up, cause I’m way up

Quick to make a milli like a lay up if they ask me who livest in this shit bet they say us , know straight up (yeah)
And you won’t see me paying no nigga cause I ain’t scared of no nigga
They gotta pay us (yeah)
And you won’t see me trickin on bitches cause I’m too lit for these bitches and nigga I’m way up , outta here
I used to want a pair of forces and sum rocawear
But now the condo in Miami got a yacht in there
Bad bitch salutar on the side of Aires
Waters comes for me
So i can go back to sleep
Now i can go back to sleep
Now i can go back to sleep

Waters comes for me
So i can go back to sleep
Now i can go back to sleep

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
My baby said he loved me
My baby said he need me
Gonna eat, sleep and breathe me out
'Til the end (Yeah)
But then my baby went bad (Went bad)
I guess he had a relapse
Had to sneak, cheat and bring me down
It had to end (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My baby falls asleep in his bed
Fingertips on the edge
He left me for a girl
But he regrets leaving me

[Chorus]
And I hope it hurts like hell (Oh-oh-oh)
And I hope it hurts likе hell (Oh-oh-oh)
You shoulda  never lеt me go
I know I’m messing up your mind
The devil got you good this time
And I hope it hurts like hell (Oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
My baby said he loved me (Yeah, I do)
My baby had it easy (Yeah)
Let him touch, kiss and please me
All night and day, yeah
Remember when we took that trip to Cabo
24 hours, then we took it to the chateau
How does it feel to do it on your own? (On your own)
Missing me (Me, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My baby’s all alone (Alone) in his bed (Bed)
Fingertips (Tips) on the edge (Oh-oh)
He left me for a girl
But he regrets leaving me

[Chorus]
And I hope it hurts like hell (Oh-oh-oh)
And I hope it hurts like hell (Oh-oh-oh)
You shoulda never let me go
I know I'm messing up your mind
The devil got you good this time
And I hope it hurts like hell (Oh-oh-oh)
(I really hope it hurts like hell)

[Outro]
I really hope it hurts like hell, I really hope it hurts like hell
(I really hope it hurts like hell)
I really hope it hurts like hell, I really hope it hurts
I really hope it hurts like, like hell
I really hope it hurts like, like, like hell
I really hope it hurts like, like hell (Uh)
I really hope it hurts like, like
Like hell

[Intro: Ms. Pat & T.I.]
The L.I.B.R.A
I'm Ms. Pat from Fair Street Bottom
Do you know how hard it is to have odds stacked against you
And flip the scale in your favor?
I flipped bricks and bitch niggas for what I got
Fuck that shit, I learned how to cook cocaine
Before I learned how to boil a egg, nigga
I used to can cook a cocaine cake like a birthday cake
Put a lil' baking soda, then when we stepped on it
With the comeback, boy, you really came the fuck up
That's how I got my first set of Jordan's
Fuck y'all laughin' at? Hahaha
Bein' a legend is not about runnin' the streets
It's about runnin' your business (Yeah)
Raisin' kids or lacin' wigs, a hustler never die, baby

[Verse: T.I.]
Okay, two six figures, solitaire, don't play with mе
Half a million on my necklace, spent it blatantly
Evеn in this pandemic, nigga, goddamn it
I'm like, "Well, F it, I'ma get one, why would I not wear it?"
Now stop starin', in Bel Air with a hot pair
She suck it 'til it hard, then she squat there
Ain't got' do shit, nigga, fuck how you feel, I do not care
I been a mastermind since you was in a highchair
I was a millionaire before you had a idea
I keep my head on the swivel, peep the side mirror
The penthouse, top floor, I reside there
Mhm, everybody get it, that is my prayer
But I know everyone can't make it and it not fair
It lonely at the top, but you can't beat this view, I swear
Ain't no comparison, the thought is just embarrassin'
Worth a hunnid and fifty now, I'm gon' quadruple that
Lil bit', we control the culture, got the proof for that (Uh-huh)
Activatin' movements, I'm the truth at that
Know how to multiply my assets, ain't no stupid cat
Every day I'm wakin' up and doin' deals
Buyin' when it low, when it get high, I sell
If I go crazy, sorry, that just how I am
Think I got post-traumatic stress for years of gettin' active
Paranoid, think everybody gunnin' at me
I could be slightly schizophrenic, but don't nobody panic
If you ain't come up how I did, you wouldn't understand it
Hah, assaultin' the police, I caught a case in Tampa
I bonded out and did the show, act like it never happened
When I look back on all that shit, I ain't got no regret
Just all the lessons, wouldn't believe we really did that shit
If I ain't live it, stay true to you, you can make a killing
Okay, listen, there business and there the bullshit, ain't no fuckin' feelings
Uh-huh, spent a hunnid thousand at my fucking dentist
Look, own a building, stop us at my fucking tenant
Yeah, blow Viola Cannabis on some Atlanta shit
Yeah, you hot, I'm a candlestick, put you on channel six
Yeah, you can't challenge this, rose above the challenges
Tightrope walkin' twenty years, I ain't lost my balance yet
Yeah, King, bitch

[Outro: Ms. Pat]
Twenty years and you still rockin', nigga, ain't nothin' get old
I don't even see grey hairs on you
What you usin', Just for Men? Hahahaha
Nigga, you my favorite motherfuckin' rapper
Now I wanted to suck Ice Cube's titty, but I always liked you
You ain't sexy to me, that nigga Ice Cube is sexy
But you my favorite motherfuckin' rapper, TIP
You the baddest motherfucker in Atlanta, I can tell you that

[...] I miss you and our dirty night
You are the best at what you do, and I know how to keep property

[Intro: Ant Clemons]
Wait a minute, uh

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
You came to me without warning
And I was unprepared
Losing all my intuition, tryna act like I don’t care
I’m so lost in all this madness
So I'm throwing up a flare
But you know, baby, I’m a problem
Tryna act like I'm not scared

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Caught me in ways that I can't explain
You got me questioning all my faith
I’m so confused
Thought I could handle this tidal wave
Hit me so hard I got slipped away into you
(You-ooh)

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Ant Clemons]
Act of God, don’t know how it started
Now I'm boutta lose at all, but I can’t control it
I could try to run away, but I know I won’t be safe
‘Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God, ‘cause I can’t control it
Wait a minute, uh

[Post-Chorus: Ant Clemons]
I’m lifted, my God
And the ways we move
Like the thing on the hood of my car (Car)
Got me lifted (Lifted)
Act of God (On God)
Lay my hands on me, ooh
Set my soul on fire (Ooh)

[Verse 2: Dua Lipa]
Could this be a revelation?
Tell me, is this what I need?
‘Cause all this divine intervention
I’m starting to believe
Is this all an accident, or is this by design?
I know I didn’t ask for it
But now I need it to be mine (Need it to be)

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Caught me in ways that I can’t explain
You got me questioning all my faith
I’m so confused (Confused)
Thought I could handle the tidal wave
Hit me so hard I got swept away into you
(You-ooh)

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Ant Clemons]
Act of God, don’t know how it started
No I'm boutta lose at all, but I can’t control it
I could try to run away, but I know I won’t be safe
‘Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God, ‘cause I can’t control it
Wait a minute, uh

[Bridge: Dua Lipa]
I’m scared of the fall
Scared of losing it all, losing my way
It’s my way or nothing
But you give me something I just can’t explain
But then I got lost, lost in you, babe
Got lost in your ways and nothing can save me
Nothing can save me

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Ant Clemons]
Act of God, don’t know how it started
No I'm boutta lose at all, but I can’t control it
I could try to run away, but I know I won’t be safe
‘Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God, ‘cause I can’t control it
Wait a minute, uh

[Post-Chorus: Ant Clemons]
I’m lifted, my God
And the ways we move
Like the thing on the hood of my car (Car)
Got me lifted (Lifted)
Act of God (On God)
Lay my hands on me, ooh
Set my soul on fire (Ooh)
(Verse 1)
When I get up
It takes all day
To feel awake

I did a song

[?]
Still aches the same

I get the feeling
That I'm maybe
Out too late

But when I get
To feel the sun
Come through the shades


(Chorus)
Sundown
Think I'm much better now
Cut through the town

[?] house

That shirt you found

[?] mouth

We'll fill the whole house


(Verse 2)
Behind the wall
Another sleeper
Nodding off

A nightmare in
The morning light

[?]

I get the feeling
That I'm sleeping
In too late

But I don't miss
A thing when I'm here
Anyway

(Chorus)
Sundown
Think I'm much bettеr now

Cut through the town

[?] house

That shirt you found

[?] mouth

We'll fill thе whole house

[Intro]
Hmm, hmm

[Verse 1]
I'm numb and I'm broken, my wounds are so close
And I'm trying to tie a knot where the bar is still open tonight, tonight
Put the cup to my lessons, I speak without thinking
And it'll all disappear if I just keep on drinking tonight, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Why am I dealing with our pain?
The past won't go away
But a truth'd make it all change?
No, no

[Chorus]
So pour me a lie tonight
I've been living it up, living it up
'Til it feels alright, make me feel alive
So pour me a lie tonight
I've been living it up, living it up
'Til I lose my mind, at least I might feel something else

[Verse 2]
Open my eyes and the sky is in mourning
A part of me died, but a new day is turning in light, in light
Confusion and heartache, I'm back where I started
I'm back at thе bar once so dearly departеd last night, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Why am I dealing with our pain?
The past won't go away
But a truth'd make it all change?
No, no

[Chorus]
So pour me a lie tonight
I've been living it up, living it up
'Til it feels alright, make me feel alive
So pour me a lie tonight
I've been living it up, living it up
'Til I lose my mind, at least I might feel something else

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1]
Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
Today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

[Chorus]
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 2]
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Bridge]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Outro]
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror

[Intro]
Too far from over you
Beams from your M2
Are blowin' through my room
And now you lay down in my shoes
You dyed your hair blue
Oh, so much déjà vu

[Verse 1]
Mmm, I shut my eyes
You call but I just cut the line
I know your style
I know that you want one more night
And I'm backsliding
Into this just one more time, mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, too far from over you
Beams from your M2
Are blowin' through my room
And now you lay down in my shoes
You dyed your hair blue
Oh, so much déjà vu
And now

[Chorus]
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
Don't you want some more?
'Cause I can feel your love, mm-mmm

[Verse 2]
Mmm, that purple touch
Everyone who sees you falls in love
You eat us up
You live like you're on camera
You slide on top
A moon to all the juice in us, mm-mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, too far from over you
Beams from your M2
Are blowin' through my room
And now you lay down in my shoes
You dyed your hair blue
Oh, so much déjà vu
And now

[Chorus]
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
Don't you want some more?
'Cause I can feel your love, mmm

[Bridge]
Maybe in time
When we're both better at life
Daylight can open my eyes
And you'll still be by my side
But meanwhile
I've got my contact high
You've got your powdered lies
We've got these summertime nights
Night by night, I let you eat me alive
I want you to eat me alive
I want you to eat me alive

[Chorus]
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
Don't you want some more?
'Cause I can feel your love

[Outro]
I can feel your love, mmm

[Intro]
Yeah, woo

[Verse 1]
I said to you, "Why did you do it?"
Touch the glass, I'll feel ya through it
Against the wall with the bracelets on
You look bizarre in the apricot

[Chorus]
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours

[Verse 2]
Gotta be all that coco, ayy?
Playin' too much of that GTA
Playin' too much of that Dr. Dre
Doom, Quake, where'd you get the gun from, eh?
Really think that metal gonna make you safe?
Playing peek-a-boo with the devil these days
Black cap back with a trench coat, ayy
Living in the Valley cuttin' porno tapes

[Chorus]
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours

[Verse 3]
Were you bored of gender norms?
Of being alone, no mama home
A bad divorce, or sad we can't
Afford the clothes our heroes own?
Remember when you stole
Mom's old Geo Metro
You wore her old bathrobe
Too small to see the road

[Bridge]
We were just two Texas toddlers
Pokémon and bottle rockets
Dunkaroos and Real Monsters
Capri Sun straw in the bottom

[Chorus]
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours
Hey!

[Verse 4]
Heard you were lookin' up the cookbook, names
Cut into the back of your bedroom door frame
Supervillain with a manifesto, dang
Gotta say I'm pretty glad they caught you, man
Get back to the kickball days
Scared to hold hands at school disco days
007, Nintendo, James
Bond, Hot Pockets in the microwave

[Chorus]
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours

[Verse 1]
My heart beats kinda slow
Like a tired soldier's piccolo
Who's seen more than he wanted to
You're all I know
Sometimes I wish it wasn't so but
To thine own self be true

[Chorus]
Just to hold you every now and then
That's all I need
I'll be yours until the bitter end
Or as long as you'll have me

[Verse 2]
A lonely breeze
Is moving through the dogwood trees
But I am standing still
I made my peace
With how much you get to me
And how you always will

[Chorus]
Just to hold you every now and then
Is really all I need
So I'll be yours until the bitter end
Or as long as you'll have me

[Bridge]
Half of your love
Is still enough

[Chorus]
Just to hold you every now and then
That's all I need
I'll be yours until the bitter end
Or as long as you'll have me
As long as you'll have me

[Instrumental Outro]

[Murdoc]
Talking about Elton, he came on his private jet.

[2D]
Did he?

[Murdoc]
Yeah, I- I believe you spoke to him, didn't you?

[2D]
Yeah, I spent several hours with him actually. We shared a sandwich.

[Murdoc]
Noodle, where were you during that whole thing?

[Noodle]
Well, I was making sure Elton was well watered because great minds need moisture.

[TAPE SCRATCHES]

[2D]
Y'know you're saying ''six-black'', it's pronounced 'black'.

[Murdoc]
I know, I know, I KNOW!

[2D]
You even said that to his face when we met him.

[Murdoc]
I know, I was just having a joke.

[2D]
It went for days.

[Murdoc]
Yeah, I do tend to milk it.

[TAPE SCRATCHES]

[Murdoc]
What a dude to have on board though. Something about him, I can't put my finger on it.

[Russel]
I think he'd prefer it that way.

[2D]
You mustn't put your finger on it. That was in his contract

[Russel]
Don't put the finger on the 6LACK.

[2D]
But what he likes the Pink Phantom is negativity, and you're very negative, Murdoc

[Murdoc]
Well yeah, you call it negativity, when you're into duality again, basically, it's a one, isn't it really? Negative, positive. You can't be positive without negative, you know what I mean? You can't have positive (No) without negative (He right). You can't have up without down

[2D]
You can't have Ant without Dec

[2D]
Have you ever been positive for a whole hour?
Should we try it?

[Murdoc]
Don't know if I could do it!

[2D]
Do you like my shoes?

[Murdoc]
No.

[2D]
See, that's negative. Noodle, what do you think about my shoеs?

[Noodle]
携帯変えたっても大変ね因果応報見たら出て来とるやんけそうやそのままやったらライトでかいナメクジ使われへんだ

[2D]
I think she's got a point

[Murdoc]
Ahhhh... The Pink Phantom, don't even talk to me about that. Hang on, I gotta get that mother

[Russel]
But how you gotta chop him down when he an ethereal being?

[Murdoc]
I–I got a butterfly net

[TAPE SCRATCHES]

[Murdoc]
Think the phantom was in the trunk?

[Noodle]
She was moving around in the boot so much we had to turn up the music, remember?

[Russel]
It was a heavy vibe

[Murdoc]
Under-badness, great under-badness

[Murdoc]
Spooky, wa-what, uh?

[Russel]
I spook easy – not to be confused with "speakeasy"

[2D]
I went to one once, by accident. I got very confused and they kеpt on speaking to me and I wouldn't realizе it was all a game and then they called the police. It was a "speak-difficult"
Lyrics From Snippets

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
My mom caught me jackin' off to Hannah Montana with a banana peel
Sippin' a Cherry Fanta to match my dress and my purple heels
Lookin' like Santa, but skinny in a black weave, it's real
In a stolen truck with a license to kill
I tell em' I'm Frank from Montana, the king of the hill
Except I'm a nigga from the Junkyard Gang
Bill Cosby couldn't spot me if I copied a duck and a bill
Simply 'cause I do not give a fuck like virginity
Illmatic with the tactics
I don't give a fuck how you feel, I got Wolf
I flow backwards like heat when it chills on a thermometer
I skatin', rappin', composin' photographer is back like a black bitch's hair line kilometer
Hotter than Madonna, "Doo Doo Mama" back up dancers
With the windows rolled up inside the Honda
Drivin' through Nеvada in the summer
Tyler, comma, Thе Creator is a fuckin' animal
In such, I'm spittin' like a llama, nigga
I'm a bastard, I'm a walrus, I'm a mothafuckin' llama, nigga

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Hit it from the back, thats my favourite P-O-V
P-O-V, P-O-V
Shorty brain game different, she on T-O-P
Top, she on top
Then I hit it from the side, watch me slide

Then we hit a new position, she on T-O-P
Top, she on top
(Okay!)

Turn the camera on, I wanna see you do it solo
Throw some D's on it, make it bounce like a Lolo
Did it free once, said you won't do it no more
Fuck a rich nigga, might get a little promo
Only number one so you gon' be a star with it
Got a nigga he be texting but he need to call with it
I'm a pimp and I'm limp, she gon' leave the mall with it
Tired of medium, you need a large and I'm the one with it

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Hit it from the back, I'm her favourite P-O-V
P-O-V, P-O-V
Shorty brain game different, she on T-O-P
Top, she on top
Then I hit it from the side, watch me slide
P-O-V, P-O-V
Then we hit a new position, she on T-O-P
Top, she on top

[Verse 2: Rubi Rose]
Ass up, face down, kiss it from the waist down
Make that nigga bus bus, greyhound
Look me in my eyes while you lick between my thighs
Better eat it like you grown, boy don't play 'round
Kitty so wet, you might just drown in the shit
You know I always get my way like I be frownin' and shit
You say you beat the pussy up but do you leave it black and blue?
Your favorite rapper's face is in my lap, you know my point of view, bitch

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Hit it from the back, that's my favorite P-O-V
P-O-V, P-O-V
Shorty brain game different, she on T-O-P
Top, she on top
Then I hit it from the side, watch me slide
P-O-V, P-O-V
Then we hit a new position, she on T-O-P
Top, she on top
(Okay!)

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
P-O-V, P-O-V
P-O-V, P-O-V
P-O-V, P-O-V
P-O-V, P-O-V

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Never gon' fall on my job
I'ma always go real real hard
Never gon' turn on my dogs
Everything I do for me and my squad
Shorty keep calling my phone
Thinking I want her but we don't get along
Papers or out of a bong
Everything I smoke real real strong
I don't get regular dome
Come to my crib, that's a real big home
I don't do nothing but cones
Hit the weed once and you will get stoned
I'm in the building
I'm with the millions
More than a little bit
I'm rolling more than a little bit bro

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I did a real big show
I made a lil bit of growth
Young but I still get dough
My niggas still kick doors
Y'all niggas still rеnt yours
My shit is all paid for
Hop in the car, take off
Get a nеw broad, smash off
I just got all cash, dog
I'm rich and they cut me a paycheck
Came straight to the top from the basement
My time is money, got 'em wasted
I roll the weed up and she taste it
You prolly end up where my place is
Pulled up with a bag full of faces
Full of faces
Full of faces
Now she look in amazement

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Never gon' fall on my job
I'ma always go real real hard
Never gon' turn on my dogs
Everything I do for me and my squad
Shorty keep calling my phone
Thinking I want her but we don't get along
Papers or out of a bong
Everything I smoke real real strong
I don't get regular dome
Come to my crib, that's a real big home
I don't do nothing but cones
Hit the weed once and you will get stoned
I'm in the building
I'm with the millions
More than a little bit
I'm rolling more than a little bit bro

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit da Hoodie]
Yeah, I know the Hills feel good
But so what, I'm still real hood
She told me the pill still good
You don't have to squeal, it feels good, yeah
Adderall pills feel good, yeah
I know they would kill for a bill, yeah
Made a couple million off the deal, yeah
But I'm still in my hood, yeah
Drop top coup in my hood, yeah
I get money, I'm good, yeah
I break hearts but I'm in love, yeah
Superbad like McLovin
I'm so good at switching subjects
I count up and make 'em upset
Purple check, I pour more Perc's, yeah
Purple drink, got syrup on deck
And everything that I said, you probably don't care
I'm only thinking about you 'cause you're not here
And I came in a Lamborghini, it ain't fair
Amiri jeans, prolly got a hundred damn pairs
Hoodie on, trust me it's a nightmare
Put a bullet on his ass 'cause I don't fight fair
Putting on my glove, feelin' like Mike, yeah

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Never gon' fall on my job
I'ma always go real real hard
Never gon' turn on my dogs
Everything I do for me and my squad
Shorty keep calling my phone
Thinking I want her but we don't get along
Papers or out of a bong
Everything I smoke real real strong

[Verse 1: Jacob Collier]
You been making me feel like I'm lonely, baby
And I don't know what I did wrong
I don't know what
Lately I been driving myself crazy, baby (Oh)
Girl, you left me all alone, you know that

[Chorus: Jacob Collier]
Did I forget to feel?
Everything is falling down
Baby, this old world is nothing without you
I don't know what I can do
I thought it was real
But, girl, you got me crashing down
Baby, I still love you, Lord, I know it's true
I don't know what I am to you
Now I'm all alone

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Kiana Ledé, Jacob Collier]
Something in me hopes that you still love me, baby
But I know you been moving on, I know that
Thinking like I been feeling this without you, baby
I miss you more than I let on, you know that

[Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
When our love was new
I remember holding you
Hoping everything you needed I could do
That I could do it all for you
Wish that it was true
But, boy, you left me here too long
Thinking I still love you, Lord, I know I do
But I'm never coming back to you
Now I'm on my own

[Outro: Jacob Collier]
I'm on my own
On my own
My own
Counting sheep
I'm in too deep
You're mine to keep
You'rе fast asleep
I'm counting sheep
I'm in too deep
You're mine to keep
You're fast asleep
I'm counting sheep
I'm in too deep
You'rе mine to keep
You're fast asleep
I'm counting sheep
I'm in too deep
You're mine to keep
You're fast asleep
I'm counting sheep
I'm in too deep
You're mine to keep
You're fast asleep, I'm

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, it's all good

[Chorus]
It’s all good (All good)
No, don't worry, I'll be okay, I’ll be good (I'm good, I'm good, I'm good)
I learned that I can't control everything you do (Everything)
Lost my patience tryna wait here all on you (Can't wait no more)
I'm giving up on giving a fuck with you

[Verse]
Oh, man, it's crazy
Never in a million years, I thought that I would make it
Just the way I made it, my biggest fans turned into some haters
Everybody talkin’ ’bout some fake shit, I can't lie, I hate it
But I don’t care 'cause I'm almost famous
Rich and got my family out the craziness
My whip look like a space ship
Black truck on some extra space shit
Everybody back home think I made it
Damn, shit's crazy

[Bridge]
What do you want from me?
I’m just tryna be what I'm 'posed to bе, oh, yeah
They want it all from me
But thеy won't get a thing at all 'cause I-

[Chorus]
It's all good (All good)
No, don't worry, I'll be okay, I'll be good (I'm good, I'm good, I'm good)
I learned that I can't control everything you do (Everything)
Lost my patience tryna wait here all on you (Can't wait no more)
I'm giving up on giving a fuck with you

[Open Verse]

[Intro]
Doubt me, doubt me, doubt me, doubt me

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Diamonds pressing all up on my chest, mhm
Fuck with me, you fuckin' with the best, mhm
No sleep, I don't get no rest, mhm
Lot of ink covering my flesh, mhm
Stay out in the west but I run my city
Shorty got a friend, they can both come with me
We gon' roll up, pour a drink, get tipsy
Rolling up a J screaming "R.I.P. Nipsey"

[Chorus]
Even when they doubt, when they doubt me, doubt me
Even when they doubt, when they doubt me, I'll be on top
Twenties at the bottom, hundreds on top
Twentiеs at the bottom, hundreds on top
Twentiеs at the bottom, hundreds on top
Twenties at the bottom, hundreds on top

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Grind everyday, I don't get no break
I be up early trying to get this cake
Brought enough weed so we all get baked
Brought enough gin so we all get straight
Always on time, I don't call in late
Niggas mad, look at all this hate
Big bud, you don't call this shape
Wizzle Man, what you call him? Great

[Chorus]
Even when they doubt, when they doubt me, doubt me
Even when they doubt, when they doubt me, I'll be on top
Even when they doubt, when they doubt me, doubt me
Even when they doubt, when they doubt me, I'll be on top
Twenties at the bottom, hundreds on top
Twenties at the bottom, hundreds on top
Twenties at the bottom, hundreds on top
Twenties at the bottom, hundreds on top

[Outro]
When they doubt me, doubt me
When they doubt me, I'll be on top
When they doubt me, doubt me
When they doubt me, I'll be on top

[Chorus]
Just the wind in my hair from the top 'cause I got it down
Booking flights for myself, it's just me when I'm out of town
And that my heart breaks everytime I see your face
Wish I could make you smile this time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around

[Verse 1]
This time, I ain't skipping over it this time
I ain't missing out, I'ma get mine
Looking back like "Damn, it was just time"
This time, I won't be feeling nothing, I'll be just fine
Take the perfect shot, I ain't gon'' misfire
This time, everything is aligned if you just being definеd

[Chorus]
Just the wind in my hair from the top 'cause I got it down
Booking flights for mysеlf, it's just me when I'm out of town
And that my heart breaks everytime I see your face
Wish I could make you smile this time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around

[Verse 2]
And around we go
You ain't with me unless we both got a pound to blow
Before you met me, wasn't even around the smoke
Now you be rolling it up and blowing it down for sure
You say it's been a minute
You love it when I'm in it
You never wanna finish
You say it's been a minute
You love it when I'm in it
You never wanna finish
Don't play, you want the business

[Bridge]
Hearts been broken
Truths been spoken
Peaceful thinking
Minds been opened
Hold you in my arms
Keep you here with me
Don't wanna let you down

[Outro]
So I can make you smile this time around, this time around
Time around, this time around
Time around, this time around

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I got big plans for you, spending big racks
I'ma mix this with that
Little weed, a little liquor, shorty ass fat
Bring it here and bend it over, I'ma tap that
Smoke a joint and pass, I call it a trap nap
Pillow talking to that bitch who got a bad rep
I can't put you on my team 'less you an asset
Smoking kush, I'm on the stuff don't wanna pass that

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
In my duffle, I can't stay up out my bag yeah
Give her dick, I'm never filling up her Cash App
I put my new bitch on chronic, we ain't alcoholics
But we getting bottles and we drinking all this
I remember back then they used to sleep on us
Didn't hit us back, wouldn't hear a peep from 'em
When I hit the ground told myself to keep running
Now these niggas mad and they got the weak stomach
I'm just tryna call Pharrell for that Richard Mille
Putting kushy in the air, make sure you inhale
Hop back up in the town and got insecure
Shorty back it on me now while I pull your hair

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I got big plans for you, spending big racks
I'ma mix this with that
Little weed, a little liquor, shorty ass fat
Bring it here and bend it over, I'ma tap that
Smoke a joint and pass, I call it a trap nap
Pillow talking to that bitch who got a bad rep
I can't put you on my team 'less you an asset
Smoking kush, I'm on the stuff don't wanna pass that (okay)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
She a Toronto girl and she know how to roll up
I hit the six and like the weather I be froze up
She smell the kushy in her nose, I just tell her touch her toes
Brought another fell with, that means it's four of us
We getting a penthouse so come up a couple floors
We ordering another course, you smell the weed through the doors
We rolling up and drinking, this ain't no shit you ain't done before
Don't even gotta say I'm that nigga 'cause you been well informed
Take a shot, now we on another level
Say you down you lose control if I let you
And as long as I don't treat you like you one of them other bitches
You gon' show me all the reasons that you special

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I got big plans for you, spending big racks
I'ma mix this with that
Little weed, a little liquor, shorty ass fat
Bring it here and bend it over, I'ma tap that
Smoke a joint and pass, I call it a trap nap
Pillow talking to that bitch who got a bad rep
I can't put you on my team 'less you an asset
Smoking kush, I'm on the stuff don't wanna pass that

[Intro]
Oh-woah
Oh, oh, oh
Lately, I've just been feelin' like
We might have to try somethin' else

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too late for us
Girl, I'm done fakin' love
Got my mind made up and I can't do this no more
But somehow, you got me so unsure
It goes two ways in love
Can't be the one chasin' us
All my money and time, I can't spend it no more
Can't be myself if I can't be yours

[Verse 1]
Look, never been the one to play the fool
Always been the one to keep it cool
I'm a player, got me breakin' rules
Ever since I fеll in love with you
Keep it one hundred likе the proof
Drinkin' all night, please excuse
Anythin' I'm 'bout to say to you
I don't really got nothin' to lose
Swangin' and ridin', I pull up and slide in you
Say it's just me but I feel like you're lyin'
Your phone's goin' crazy, you switch it to silent
I only do that when there's somethin' I'm hidin'

[Chorus]
It's too late for us
Girl, I'm done fakin' love
Got my mind made up and I can't do this no more
But somehow, you got me so unsure
It goes two ways in love
Can't be the one chasin' us
All my money and time, I can't spend it no more
Can't be myself if I can't be yours

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I've been drownin', tryna catch a wave
You've been out here, tryna run your game
I've been thinkin' I should do the same
But I could never put you through the pain
I don't wanna have to turn the page
See which way the story 'bout to play
We might have to try another day
We gon' have to try another way
Leanin' and drivin', I'll be there in five
And you in a position before I arrive
And I don't need no guidance, you wet like Poseidon
I wish it could be like this every time

[Chorus]
But it's too late for us
Girl, I'm done fakin' love
Got my mind made up and I can't do this no more
But somehow, you got me so unsure
It goes two ways in love
Can't be the only one chasin' us
All my money and time, I can't spend it no more
Can't be myself if I can't be yours

[Outro]
Too late

[Intro]
Sledgren

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Ooh, I got a band or two
Baby, tell me what's the move
Diamonds wet, come take a cruise
They ain't walkin' in my shoes
Trying, they gon' lose
I don't make excuses
Parked the old one pull up in my new shit
Pull out all my diamonds and them broads gon' lose it
Spend the night with me, now the broad wanna move in

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I be on my Queen Khalifa kush, no bullshit
Just one button when I start my car, just push it
I'm with Young Maxo, we be on some hood shit
I just took what you spent on your crib and put it on my wrist
I just took my girl and introduced her to another bitch
Started from the bottom, I had nothing, now I'm gettin' rich
Used to be with Sledgren, he was down to empty out the clip
Now we out in Hollywood rolling up another zip
Who the fuck you with?
Diamonds I got different colors
Police coming, we ain't tellin'
Pack is loud, my kush is yellin'
I can get the whole floor, at the telli
Living like I'm Makaveli
White Benz ike in Belly

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Ooh, I got a band or two
Baby, tell me what's the move
Diamonds wet, come take a cruise
They ain't walkin' in my shoes
Trying, they gon' lose
I don't make excuses
Parked the old one and pull up in my new shit
Pull out all my diamonds and them broads gon' lose it
Spend the night with me, now the broad wanna move in

[Verse 2: Maxo Kream]

[?] Maxo 

[?] I'm groovin'
My pockets fat like 

[?]
Johnny Dang, fifty on my chain, I bought a Cuban
Diamonds playing peek-a-boo, I snatch a hoe like Pikachu
I give and go, no pick and choose
Crisp C-notes, my money blue
OG gas bag reefer, I slang that Wiz Khalifa
Bust down AP two-tone with a yellow bone diva
Bitch a perfect Mona Lisa, tell me have you seen her
Like Venus and Serena, indica, sativa
Bad bitch like Meagan Good
No swishers, we smokin' wood
She suck me and slurp me good
Been pimpin' my money good
Big crippin', it's understand
I be thumbing through them bands
You wanna do shit but you can't

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Ooh, I got a band or two
Baby, tell me what's the move
Diamonds wet, come take a cruise
They ain't walkin' in my shoes
Trying, they gon' lose
I don't make excuses
Parked the old one and pull up in my new shit
Pull out all my diamonds and them broads gon' lose it
Spend the night with me, now the broad wanna move in

[Verse 3: SNSTBLVD]
Wake up early in the morning, breakfast with my fruit
She came in with him but she love the way I move
Anything he can do, I can do it too
Everything 

[?] Gucci on my shoes
Come back to my backyard, I show you the rules
You could take your drugs, I'm rolling jays by the two
Stripper 

[?] got her feet in the pool
Stars on the ceiling when we go back to my room

[Verse 1]
Had she lost another one
She would've end just like her son
Bitter man now turned insane
Day his dog took on the train

[Verse 2]
Had she lost another one
She would've end just like her mom
Dyed the hair to look as young
Inhaled fumes and spoiled a lung

[Chorus]
By grace, she was spared
A few toes, a few to care

[Verse 3]
Had she lost another one
Insurance lawyers would have won
Settle quick, the course was cheap
Didn’t bother to go deep

[Verse 4]
I saw the home she's from
No place for one to hum
That pride so dear to some
She learned to overcome
Fate unearned

[Chorus]
By grace, she was spared
A few toes, a few to care
By grace, she was spared
A few toes, enough to care

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Can't imagine bein' average
Reppin' my gang 'til I'm in the casket
Diamonds rings, don't mean to be flashin'
One of 'em straight, one of 'em nasty
Love when they strip, I love when they classy
Niggas be fake, these niggas be plastic
And I've been cakin' if you askin'
There's the fake and there's the real, you ain't foolin' me, nigga
Lotta money to be made out here, just who gonna get it?
In a class of my own, I don't see no compеtition
Shawty ass kinda swole, she bend it ovеr, I'm tippin'

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm up early in the morning 'cause you know we be grindin'
Do anything for my dawgs, just let me know the assignment
Need a jet, need a check, with a whole bunch of commas
If I step for the now i get a whole bunch of profit
Niggas used to holdin' choppers, now we smoke out with doctors
Money bulgin' out my pocket, if you want it I got it
We don't do regular problems, stay away from the gossip
Runnin' up them bank deposits, new bitch straight out of college
Nigga this is real life, this ain't no cops or robbers
All my niggas from the bottom and they wanna move proper
All I know is do it big, that's what I seen as a toddler
Stay the fuck up out the way, you hang around you get caught up
You niggas broke, you always with some niggas fuckin' the product
You the type that can't do right because no one ever taught him
Always late to catch a flight, I never rush to get on
I've been trappin' all night then I'm up early in the mornin'

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Can't imagine bein' average
Reppin' my gang 'til I'm in the casket
Diamonds rings, don't mean to be flashin'
One of 'em straight, one of 'em nasty
Love when they strip, I love when they classy
Niggas be fake, these niggas be plastic
And I've been cakin' if you askin'
There's the fake and there's the real, you ain't foolin' me, nigga
Lotta money to be made out here, just who gonna get it?
In a class of my own, I don't see no competition
Shawty ass kinda swole, she bend it over, I'm tippin'

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Droppin' the top, I'm at the roof
Everything is exclusive
Even down to my bitch, you with one that's ran through
I just stick to the code, I ain't makin' the rules
If you niggas still broke, there really ain't no excuses
Pull up in the four-door,all my niggas pull out them coupes
Wipin' off my prints quick 'cause they investigate clues
Niggas see what's on my neck, and give respect for jeweler
Tell 'em I don't need a script 'cause every day like the moves
I don't wear it on me, got no idea what I've been through
Smell a lot of KK on me, hit the block and spin through
Know I smoke a lotta gas, so I gotta refuel
Hit 'em once and then I pass, I'ma hardly reuse
Kept it solid, rep the gang, 'cause that's what a G do
If you 'bout money, rollin' up and countin' hunnids me too
You could tell by all the times we keep on winnin', we up
I could smoke a pound a day and by the night I reup

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Can't imagine bein' average
Reppin' my gang 'til I'm in the casket
Diamonds rings, don't mean to be flashin'
One of 'em straight, one of 'em nasty
Love when they strip, I love when they classy
Niggas be fake, these niggas be plastic
And I've been cakin' if you askin'
There's the fake and there's the real, you ain't foolin' me, nigga
Lotta money to be made out here, just who gonna get it?
In a class of my own, I don't see no competition
Shawty ass kinda swole, she bend it over, I'm tippin'

[Outro: Young Deji]
I'm not average (Not average)

You ain't foolin' me (Not average)
I'm not average (Not average)

Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
So real I
Said fuck the suite, get the villa (Said fuck the suite, get the villa)
More McQueen chilled up (More McQueen chilled up)
Now I'm smokin' making 'em uncomfortable
When we step in the buildin' (When we step in the buildin')
Hunnid dollars bills pounds on the flight conceal
Heard they on me and they worried 'bout my paper trail
I’m at work while you goin' on vacation there

[Verse 1]
We smokin' on the shores in Jamaica
Versace robe, Balenciaga windbreaker
Come to weed, I own acres
You niggas fallin' off, need replacements
We each own our Porsche down the streets racin'
Gotta keep one eye out for leechers, swingin' for the bleachers
Bad bitch with some real features
Waitin' for my time I ain't reachin'
Joint filled up with bomb weed
Can't walk a mile in my sneaks
I'm stoned on an island full of freaks
My niggas got millions on they mind, drink liquor all the time
Fuck bitches in they prime
Drive car with switches, count tons of riches
Always stay committed
Gettin' on the plane, make sure my company name bigger
Roll up the strain, turn on the beat and I pain't pictures
They understand me and see me clear as a movie is
Value the process, wether I lose or win
Jheeze, my wrist below thirty degrees
Weed from California, my bitch come from Belize
Rollin' trees, there ain't a seat in here
Tryna get y'all to think the same way as the millionnaires
When it's all said and done, we the niggas who never run
They spendin' up all the funds, gotta save for my son
The waittress just hit the bottle, we poppin' off everyone
Smokin' weed and the motto was all that we got is trust

[Chorus]
So real I
Said fuck the suite, get the villa (Said fuck the suite, get the villa)
More McQueen chilled up (More McQueen chilled up)
Now I'm smokin' making 'em uncomfortable
When we step in the buildin' (When we step in the buildin')
Hunnid dollars bills pounds on the flight conceal
Heard the 

[?] and they worried 'bout my paper trail
I map work while you goin' on vacation there

[Verse 2]
Sixteen hours flight to Brazil
When I get there shit is real
Got a lot of beautiful women
But they money's what appeal to me
I know exactly how it feel
Say I've been here before, I know to me it ain't enough
Games I don't play with 'em
They be so mad 'cause after I fuck I don't stay
Fuck around, got another one on the way
If she give me an attitude
I'm killin' stage, the crowds of fans that would laugh at you
I'm rollin' up, while you can't smoke, I'ma pass a few
We gettin' money, the niggas with me they havin' too
Eatin' steak and shrimp, hotels tell us that we can't smoke, ain't that a bitch?
Come to my room and we gon' blow the whole zip
Security might come up but they won't trip
And if they do, I'ma walk out and I'ma talk to that nigga like
"Hmm, it's nice to meet you sir, I'm Young Khalifa
If you don't mind, I'ma spark this weed up
I know you got some family members you can call that I can take a picture for, yeah I'll be glad to meet 'em
It ain't my fault, you can take it or leave it
You smell the kush, so it's not a secret"
Ain't the one you wanna look around and you not on the team with
I'm a boss, I be on some G shit

[Chorus]
So real I
Said fuck the suite, get the villa (Said fuck the suite, get the villa)
More McQueen chilled up (More McQueen chilled up)
Now I'm smokin' making 'em uncomfortable
When we step in the buildin' (When we step in the buildin')
Hunnid dollars bills pounds on the flight conceal
Heard the 

[?] and they worried 'bout my paper trail
I map work while you goin' on vacation there

[Outro]
They don't make 'em like they used to
The way me and my gang move around the world like we ain't got a thing to prove
Why you worried about who's who?
We takin' trips goin' to beaches
And spend the money on dinners and places we thought we'd never be
Experiencin' things we thought we'd never see
Was hated on heavily
Now our girls look heavenly
And you can tell it's me, just by the smell
Our own kush to inhale, the McQeen shots to celebrate the times when we couldn't be here
Rollin' up another paper to elevate my mind
Not knowin' if the owner's cool or not
I just got a show to do and a bunch of fans to meet
So if I'm not in my best mind state, how you expect me to do my best?
Thank you, I'ma continue smokin' now
Prayin' to make it home is an understatement
But I know God got my back
He wouldn't give me more than I could handle
I just gotta step up to the play, and be a boss when the time comes
Who wants to chase success and run from their real responsibilities at the same time?
That sounds like hustlin' backwards to me
But I'm tryna hold it down, 'til we back in the villa again

[Verse 1]
Handshakes and bitter rows
Are the common conjecture
I can dissect anything
And save the skin for later
I know it's just a time
And things will get better
But I don't mind much anyway
Vampire reflection

[Chorus]
Gestured in our selfish understanding
Tensions only surface when you're hurt, h-h-h-hurt
Like a magpie's morning monologue
Whispers bending backwards in the dirt
The dirt, the dirt

[Verse 2]
Make time to say you're right
You should already know this
With next to no pretension
Still, I'm walking on egg shells
Catch your breath, I'm heading out
Be sure others will notice
This is just a product of
Your vampire reflection

[Chorus]
Gestured in our selfish understanding
Tensions only surface when you're hurt, h-h-h-hurt
Like a magpie's morning monologue
Whispers bending backwards in the dirt
The dirt, the dirt

[Verse 1]
Open your eyes and light the fluid
Get into it, perihelion
Middle Hell, wrecked with metal
Bury children

[Chorus 1]
Colonization
Urbanization
Recreation 

[?]
There is one Planet B
Open your eyes and see

[Verse 2]
Open your eyes and shoot the dingo
While this shit goes out the window
Evil twin, rot you will
If you continue

[Chorus 2]
Only way through is colonization
Urbanization
Recreation

Colonization

Open your eyes and see
Wonders wither, pen and paper, sign this waiver
Can cause death, unkindness, or excess
Now profess to the future head of state
Sign your fate, elevate, automate

Join the last migration, it's fun
Fuck the system
Your new best mate is great
King of the bald primate
We are not worthy
Of our heir's glory
Mental rotation for the overlord

Super-organism caused a schism
Bending light through prisms
Cyber-surgeon
JavaScript person
Digital cleanse
Tell all your friends the neural network's at work

Transmogrification
'Cause you cannot keep a lie from no A.I
Don't pretend or you'll die
Don't stand by
Don't close your subordinate eyes
Prepare for mutation
Because after all
I'm sure I heard the crack of doom
Death kiss
Everyone should be talking 'bout this
Human karma dinosaur inside a simulation

Join the last migration

Wonders wither, pen and paper, sign this waiver
Can cause death, unkindness, or excess
Now profess to the future head of state
Sign your fate, elevate, automate

[Verse 1]
Most of what I like
Is given to me by
The one that I love
Bears the onus every time
Technically I don't deserve
To live this kind of life
Perturbed at what I might become
Unchanging every time
Ecstasy is what I'm needing
I'm bleeding from the eyes
You always shut your eyes
When you look me in the eyes

[Chorus]
Always caressing
The ropes which I've frayed
The corpse that I'm dressing
Should nеver be displayed
Should nеver be displayed
Should never be displayed

[Verse 2]
Face to face is nice
But sharper than a knife
I teeter on it's edge
Waiting to be sliced
Returning home brain dead
And you inject the life
Appeal to me love
Remake, rebuild, revise
Restavit is what I'm bleeding
A laxative to cry
You always shut your eyes
When you look me in the eyes

[Chorus]
Always caressing
The ropes which I've frayed
The corpse that I'm dressing
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Danger money, danger money
Danger money, I want danger money
Danger money, danger funny!
Danger money, I want danger money

Danger money, danger money
Danger money, I want danger money
Danger money, danger funny!
Danger money, I want danger money

Danger money, danger money
Danger funny! Danger funny!
Danger money, danger money
Danger money, dangеr money, come on

[Verse 1: Nathan]
Pair me with your roof and I might jump
Skull cracking open, throat with a lump
Summer will come by and then it will leave
Why am I wearing my heart on my sleeve?

[Chorus: Nathan]
Take away everything
I am just someone in search of songs to sing
Take away everything
Words like these don't come around enough for me

[Verse 2: Nathan]
But I am an ocean, quick to the draw
Legs of a runner, blood of my Pa
There's insides to outsides and I'm in both
Seems like I'm losing most of my hope

[Chorus: Nathan]
Take away everything
I am just someone in search of songs to sing
Take away еverything
Words like thesе don't come around enough for me

[Outro: Nathan]
What's the point of anything?
I am just someone in search of songs to sing
What's the point of anything?
Words like these don't come around enough for me

[Verse 1]
Day after day
Miles and miles of railroad track
Night after night
Humming of the wheels
Their hum seems to say
He'll follow you someday
But someday seems a million miles away

[Verse 2]
Day after day
Make a dollar, need it twice
Night after night
Lie awake and dream
Of days of auld lang syne
Moonlight through the pine
And linen tablecloths all stained with wine

[Verse 3]
Day after day
Watch the hands move 'round the clock
Night after night
Searching for my soul
So this must be my fate
To sit and weep and wait
And pray my darling comes before too late
There is a house in New Orleans
They call The Rising Sun
It's been the ruin of many a poor girl
And me, oh God, for one

If I had listened to what my mama said
I'd be at home today
But I was young and foolish, poor girl
Let a gambler lead me astray

My mother, she's a tailor
She sews those old blue jeans
My father, he's a gamblin' man
Drinks down in New Orleans

Go tell my baby sister
Not to do as I have done
You shun that house in New Orleans
They call it The Rising Sun

Well, I'm going back to New Orleans
My race is almost run
I'm going to spеnd the rest of my days
Benеath that Rising Sun
Well, one foot is on the platform
And the other one's on the train
I'm going to spend the rest of my days
Wearing that ball and chain

[Intro: 070 Shake]
Fallin', dreamin', talkin' in your sleep
I know you want to cry all night, all night
Plottin', schemin', findin'
Reason to defend all of your violent nights
Promise me you will see

[Chorus 1: 070 Shake]
Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (Night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

[Verse: Chance the Rapper]
Sturdy, solid and sturdy, voice of a birdie
Told me, "Just stay determined, she would deter me"
Purdy, pretty and curvy, developed early
Curve me, 'til she finally heard me, and one day she served me
"Hurt me," she just kept yelling "hurt me!
Slap me and choke me and curse me!"
She still got wounds from the nursery
This is the woman who nursed me
Gave me some water when thirsty
Gave all her best to the worst me
Showed me my first bit of mercy
Showed me that someone can substitute love for so long that they don't know the difference and sex for her now is a bad anniversary
She want the alley like Kirsty, she don't remember the first me
Someone went into her purse and she just wanna know when they gon' reimburse me
She don't want no one at her sleeve, she don't want no one to court her
She don't want no one to curtsy, you know how people in church be
Callin' her fast but no one'll ask like, "Who the fuck put her at her speed?"
She come with the 

[?], and all of this happened at thirteen

[Chorus 2: Chance the Rapper]
Don't you grow up in a hurry, your momma be worried now
Some people owe you a sorry, but that's not your story now
Don't you grow up in a hurry, in a hurry, in a hurry
Hurry, hurry
Don't you grow up in a hurry, in a hurry now
In a hurry now

[Verse]
Pull up wife and gon push our button

Sittin' on the corner of Benson (Whoo, whoo)

[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
Yeah, let's take it back to the squad days (Yeah)
Sittin' on the corner of Benson (Benson)
Smoke kickin' herb with my henchman (Henchman)

Scramble your egg with a biscuit (Blagh, blagh)
Pay me, don't pay me attention (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Take it back, SQ days
Mrs. Sharon house, Lex coupe days
Had red beams for blue rays
Had 'lotta green for a few greys
Big heads before blue heads
Had loose cannons, no loose threads
Always sharp as number-2 lead
Number one when it come to new meds
Tattoo tears, few shed
Had closed ears for the who said
Extra, extra, read all about it
Her legs spread, then the news spread
Got some goons up in Shrewsbury
Turn a grape head to a prune head
A snake head to a wound head
Some snake heads be two-headed
Got two guns for that type of shit
Ballin' like we at the Super Bowl
Scorin' touchdowns and just spike this shit
You know the other team, they don't like this shit
Tell 'em kick it off, nigga, here's the tip
Party 'cause we win it every year
Players can't respect better players
Ballin' like we in the NFL

[Chorus: Gudda Gudda]
(Whoo, whoo, whoo)
I think I play in the NFL (Baow)
And you droppin' dimes like a wishing well (Yeah)
Don't mess with these women that kiss and tell (Whoo, whoo, whoo)
I think I play in the NFL (Baow)
And you droppin' dimes like a wishing well (Yeah)
Don't mess with these women that kiss and tell (Whoo, whoo, whoo)
I think I play in the NFL
I think I play in the NFL (Baow)
I think I play in the NFL (Yeah)

[Verse 3: HoodyBaby]
I started off with a old Colt girl
Link up 'cause you so dope
Doughboy 'cause I sold dough
No suit, just a gold robe (Hello)
Nigga, who am I? Am I who?
All I know, nigga, I ain't you
I just do what I came to do
Don't follow me, just follow through
My main bitch tried to tie the knot
My side bitch a ringer too
I can teach you a thing or two
My full circle drug, ring a fool
It go left, left, pass (Ayy)
Automatic cash (Ayy)
Big booty bitch (Ayy)
Girl, I'm on your ass (Ayy)
All my bitches poppin', we pop up and pop a tag (Ayy)
Call me Hoodybaby, I'm the nigga with the bag
You got some junk in your trunk
Bitch, I'm takin' out the trash
Brr, hello?

[Chorus: Gudda Gudda]
(Whoo, whoo, whoo)
I think I play in the NFL (Baow)
And you droppin' dimes like a wishing well (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
MERLYN!
Bet she flicking like Tiger the tee
And she make her wanna hold onto me
And she wanna rip my tee
And she wanna do hunting
Ain't see nothing, I don't do no fret
I don't do no, no Skyping thing
I don't do no, no testing thing
I don't do no best friending--
MERLYN!

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
I hold my hands above everything
I fuck the world up, a wedding ring
I hold the mic like I'm Heather B
I hold the mic up, let the world let me
See all the things that I want to see
One-two-three, right in front of me
Back in the day when my sister let me watch MTV before I sleep

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I don't see opposition near
Shoot the frame like I'm Lars von Trier
Won't succumb or run from my fears
For the Melancholia from my peers
Cloud above my head, hide my tears
Hydroplane while I'm shifting gears
Loop-de-loop down Mulholland Drive
Hope I land in a newer life
On a new star, on a new pitch
In a new world with a new whip
Hit light speed when I tap that gas
I won't hide from what's in my past
I don't need you lames in my life
Don't need fame to go shine my light
Bigger picture ain't in your sight
Imma paint a vision, IMAX tonight

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
I paid for fame, I should've kept my receipts
Sold my soul for a handful of weed
Still got holes in my hands and my feet
I turn pain into Sprite with the lean
Mark of the beast
Real big dog need a bone and a leash
I see demons when I'm fallin' asleep
Shadows leaving like they following me
Sold out show, but I'm still alone
Dress my best when I feel depressed
So I ain't taking no shit tonight
Quarter ounce of that kryptonite
Burn it down and I feel alright
I can't seem to outrun my problems
I get high and I never solve 'em
Roll it up and I burn my sorrow

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la

[Verse 5: Matt Champion]
Front seat, back seat, also in shotgun
Bangin' on the door like we gon' fuck it all up
All these living means they ain't fuckin' with me
Bet you thought babygirl had me down to a T
Take one to the drug spot, one to the bank
One to the summer till ya see what y'all think
Six feet under block, opp need a angel (angel)
Bean bags under my eyes like a zombie (zombie)
Someone lift the top like a purple badge (woo woo)
Weird eye color make ya bug out
When I scroll through, little me in my head, voodoo
Goo goo goo joob, early birdie get the Beatle
Fuck it up, let the meter run (meter run, meter run)
Life's short, have a little fun (little fun, little fun)
I don't give a fuck about you, yes, I gotta run
Need a smoke, damn, black lung

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]

Tell me what you wanna be, tell me who you gonna be (Cool)
Back and forth, no, I can't lie

[Verse 1]
Sammy, are you into the drug life?
Sat back and just thought about what's life
We in the crib but it's feeling like club life
I'm talking champagne, popping out the tub life
My nigga been locked since '02
This his first time riding in a foreign car
He don't want a good girl, he want a porn star
That's gonna tell him what to do like Orange star
This is a night and day job
Major league contracts bigger than a rod
Thinking it's a game but you better not play me
A whole young with an old soul
It's like I'm 80 years old and I beat a win
So I'm pushing daisies you know
Tell me, have you ever had sex on the beach?
Honestly, I prefer sex and sheets
No sand in the pussy, I like 

[?] in the pussy
Ass love but it turned to 

[?] if you push me
No plan, stuck to the plan 

[?]
Oh, I'm with the darks, still glowing up
On the top floor and we still going up
One minute we were up, we were up, we were on a roll
Next time we couldn't take it, deal, we're in danger now
That night I was wrong, I couldn't get it under control
I know I gotta hold my breath, I don't wanna, gotta hold my breath
Next day I wonder but I wasn't sure
If I would feel this way next week when I heard no more (heard no more)
Didn't really want talk or stuff, but I wanted to doubt
What did you think I'm gonna save my breath, because you're breathing on someone else
Okay you got my now, you heard the news, you blocked me out, you cut me loose

I high in love, but you let me down, and there's no coming back to me
Yeah, did you know there's no fear in love
If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath
What you did to me oh yeah I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath
(What'd you say, what'd you say)
Don't hold your breath
(What'd you say, what'd you say)
Don't hold your breath
(What'd you say, what'd you say)
Don't hold your breath
(What'd you say, what'd you say)
Don't hold your breath
It's been a week, still moping around in the same old flow
Each time I come up for air with no where to go
Every since you been on the high road, I've been feeling so low
I know I gotta hold my breath, because you're breathing on someone else
Okay you got my now, you heard the news, you blocked me out, you cut me loose

I high in love, but you let me down, and there's no coming back to me
Yeah, did you know there's no fear in love
If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath
What you did to me oh yeah I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath
(What'd you say, what'd you say)
Don't hold your breath
(What'd you say, what'd you say)
Don't hold your breath
(What'd you say, what'd you say)
Don't hold your breath
(What'd you say, what'd you say)
Don't hold your breath

Don't be cruel, because I would never be that cruel to you, so don't
Don't be foolish, because if you were so good to me then we wouldn't have to go through this, so don't
So don't be cruel, because I would never that cruel to you, so don't
Don't be foolish, because if you were so good to me then we wouldn't have to go through this, so don't

Yeah, you can't touch me now, there's no fear in love
If you think I'm coming back, don't hold breath
What you did to me oh yeah I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back, don't hold your breath
Don't hold your breath
(What'd you say, what'd you say)
Don't hold your breath
(What'd you say, what'd you say)
Don't hold your breath
(What'd you say, what'd you say)
Don't hold your breath

Used to be a poor kid, now the smoke potent
Don’t worry what a hoe did, hoe shit

Niggas want contact, Niggas want protest

Niggas my sons, but I gotta be a good dad
I don’t want no beef
I don’t owe a nigga shiiiiit!
Not, not a crumb
I bet these fuck ass niggas want me to bitе my tongue

Chorus:
God Loves Violence
And bitches hate silence

[Verse: 2]
I said, sometimes I’m a bed shaker
Sometimes I’m a bread maker
Don’t doubt your intelligence
Cuz these niggas uneducated
How do you sleep after all of them artists you fucked over?

From your own hood!
Or your family maybe
Hating behind your back
But in your face, they be animated, like
Ugh, Bobby go tough
Ugh, I got the stuff
Ugh, call out your bluff
Can’t hold me down
Cuz, as is below, so is above
Fuck off her makeup, I’m making her blush

She too young to hit
I don’t want her ass
I’m going to pass
Haha, holdup
Call me, call me Kamia
From Columbia
Eastside mafia
I was rocking furs
Michael Tyson Drugs
Bite her ear Van Gogh
Ghetto Dracula
Cocaine on my tongue
It’s Raven on my bucket list
I’m on 3 different substances
It’s a shame how all that money
Still can’t camouflage that sucker shit in you
That, that, that, that sucker shit in you
That, that, that, that sucker shit
They build a hood
Then nigga-fy it
Then gentrify it
Before you realize it
Then break it down
Then then rebuy it
It’s a vicious cycle, identify it
It’s true

Just tell them "illegal drugs are bad, so don't mess with them"
Illegal drugs are bad news, don't mess with them

What kids should know is that marijuana has more cancer causing agents than tobacco
So talk to your kids about drugs, or somebody else will

And the loopholes in between
Its that, how they intervene
Jimmy with the strings
Malcolm with my team
Bobby on the beat
With the jeans, with the beam, with the crease
With the coupe, with the seats, with the suit
With the boots, with your boo, switcheroo
Disappear, reappear, with a beard, in a group
And we ain’t never breaking up
Except the grounds, break it up
We smoke these DutchMasters up
What the slaves used to call their masters?
Dutch?

Wicked lies, in
In the dark when you can’t act civilized, in
Wicked lies, in

That's knowledge
She do what I thought her, she ain't go to college but she got that wallet
Still she gon' hit me when she want a dollar for daisy
Gave me brain, was so crazy, ain't even have to say "pay me"
She was beefing with her man, came through, laid back, say filet mi-gnon
Say "a lame niggas make me yawn"
Slizzy in the city and we gone, in the morning she can't find her thong (Where's my thong?)
Don't let that twerking fool you, that bitch know necronomicon
Don't let them titties throw you, she dress up, go to comic con
I pick my bitches real smart, bitches that know art
If she- if she acting snooty, I make that pussy fart

Can't fight this feeling, aren't you tired of being alone
You won't admit it but you know it's true
It's not a secret how I feel when I stand next to you

[Chorus]
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

[Verse 2]
Someday you'll see my point of view
You can't keep wishing on the stars, baby
What works for me can work for you
You've got to make a compromise and maybe

[Pre-Chorus]
Then we can keep our love alive
And when it falls we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game so get into the groove

[Chorus]
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

[Post-Chorus]
Causing a commotion
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion

Move-move-move-moves baby

Move-move-move-moves baby

Moves baby, moves baby
Move-move-move-moves baby

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

[Post-Chorus]
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion

[Verse 3]
You met your match when you met me
I know that you will disagree it's crazy
But opposites attract you'll see
And I won't let you get away so easy

[Pre-Chorus]
The love you save may be your own
Can't fight this feeling, aren't you tired of being alone
You won't admit it but you know it's true
It's not a secret how I feel when I stand next to you

[Chorus]
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

[Verse 4]
Someday you'll see my point of view
You can't keep wishing on the stars, baby
What works for me can work for you
You've got to make a compromise and maybe

[Pre-Chorus]
Then we can keep our love alive
And when it falls we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game so get into the groove

[Chorus]
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

[Post-Chorus]
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion
Causing a commotion, causing a commotion

[Middle 8]
I hope you find what you're looking for
Is it mine, walk through that door
We're wasting time, make up your mind
And get into the groove

I've got the moves baby
You got the motion
I've got the moves baby
You got the motion

I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

Come on, hey, hey, hey you guys
Hey, hey, hey you guys

If we got together we'd be causing a commotion
I've got the moves baby, you got the motion
If we got together we'd be causing a commotion

Come on

[Instrumental]

[Pre-Chorus]
Then we jeep our love alive
And when it falls we won't let it die
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
It's how you play the game so get into the groove

[Middle 8]
I hope you find what you're looking for
Is it mine, walk through that door
We're wasting time, make up your mind
And get into the groove

Verse 1:
Look, from heavy rotations
Mentality blind its stable and vacant (look)
No imagination (look)
Such a long way, from our generation (yeah)
Tryna find a replacement (Where?)
I find it easy using echolocation (How?)
I'm tired of the basic
I need me a bitch that's hella low maintenance (yeah)
So fuck how you feel (fuck how you feel)
That's the shit that I'm on (shit that I'm on)
They know that I'm lit
They know I'm the shit
Where I shit is considered the throne
My aura light up like aurora borealis
Seen it comin out of
Forced the fortune teller
I don't think there's a story they can tell
That's tall enough to make me ignore the Morgellon's virus
Ain't talking about Arabs when I mention ISIS (Yeah)
You know what the time is (Yeah)
When you woke as fuck its hard not to be bias (What?)
I try not to be bias (What?)

A culture divided
When I cum on these blinds

Verse: 2
Look, a slave that's barely living
A prisoner to tradition
You only care bout the homeless
On Christmas and Thanksgiving
A history that has happened
Is different from what was written
When Pedos are politicians
The documents come up missing now!
Wait for the pending trial
Ain't no sentence, wow
Shit is foul
To describe it gotta find a stringent noun
They surveillance every inch of Walmart, every hour
Find Osama in a cave
But can't find a missing child
Fuck this bullshit wanted out
Independent Route
Some may call it throwing in the towel
There's a handful of people living in a haunted house
Till the goons and goblins come running in, guns loud
Chorus:
That's just the way it is
I say, fuck how you feel
How you feel, fucking right

That's just the way it is
I say, fuck how you feel
How you feel, fucking right

So tell me, am I?
Wrong (5x)

Now am I?
Wrong (5x)

And I've been dying to kill him, uh

[Verse 3: Kevin Abstract]
I told my nigga I'm good, mm

I was addicted to wood, uh
I'm coming straight off the Suge, uh
School had doubted the bosses, ay
Sick of counting my losses, uh

He took the train and was off it, uh
My balance stuck in his pocket, uh
Relax and be easy, uh
I taught you, I'm weaker, uh

[Verse 4: JOBA]
Spent the night outside your house
Drunk as ever, can't get better, and can't do better
You say I treat you like a sidepiece
Bought a Beretta, fuck a fella
Dressed in all black tryna find a way back to your mattress
Where I can relax
Where we would just laugh
I could kill him, don't like to play the villain
But I've been feeling bent
I cross my heart and hope to love
What's wrong with that?

[Verse 5: Merlyn Wood]
(Can you turn me up on my headphones?)
Treat me like a kook, the weather getting good
Mans will manifest, they gon' see the way I cook
I said it with my chest and became a different dude
Skrt off in the Hemi
Work hard, not for pennies
Imma make that money if I'm outside sellin' green
Just for Japanese denim
I gotta be fresher than you
Last year I was destitute

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Let all the heat pour down

Now all my super ladies, I got my baby
If you got your baby, baby (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, rock your body
Dance for your papi
Put your hands up in the air
Dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air, air, air (Oh, oh, oh)
Move your body, move your body
Rock your body, rock your body
Put your hands up in the air
Dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air, air, air (Oh, oh, oh)

My rock is shining bright
Even if he ain't by my side
He makes sure that I glow

[Bridge]
Step up, step up, let your hair down
Pop, drop, and lock it, go all out
If, if he rocks, tеar up the crowd
Dance for your papi
Step up, stеp up, let your hair down
Pop, drop, and lock it, go all out
If, if he rocks, tear up the crowd
Dance for your papi

[Pre-Chorus]
Now all my super ladies, I got my baby
If you got your baby, baby (Mo-move)

[Chorus]
Move your body, move your body

Levántate, cae y asegúralo
Ve con todo
Si él es lo máximo, azota baldosa
Baila para tu papi

Shoutout to all my niggas in Jersey
To Phili'
To all my niggas in L.A
I fucked to you
(Verse 1)
Ninety-nine percent, I know you're not fine
Now everyone could be mistakenly kind
Niggas in the back try and act blind
Seven ways to think about your eyesight

(Pre-Chorus)
Say what you will, what you want
Know it's not the time that you can
Receiving a gift of change with a kiss
When nights alone and nights you're bored
And can't resist or miss the chance of being who they think they think you are
How long before your journey will end in sweet stone?
Walls inside of me that then tell me to breathe
That shake your hand and thank the man for just letting it be

(Chorus)
Know my worth and fake the blame
But I know she's better than me
Wait your turn and change your ways
But I know he's better than me
Why choose love when hate comes first?
And I know they're better than me
Wait your turn and change your ways
And I know he's better than me
(Verse 2)
Ninety-nine percent, I know you're not fine
Now everyone could be mistakenly kind

(Pre-Chorus)
Say what you will, what you want
Know it's not the time that you can
Receiving a gift of change with a kiss
When nights alone and nights you're bored
And can't resist or miss the chance of being who they think they think you are
How long before your journey will end in sweet stone?
Walls inside of me that then tell me to breathe
That shake your hand and thank the man for just letting it be

(Chorus)
Know my worth and fake the blame
But I know he's better than me
Wait your turn and change your ways
And I know she's better than me
Why choose love when hate comes first?
And I know they're better than me
Wait your turn and change your ways
And I know he's better than me

(Outro)
I know he's better
And I know and I know and I know
He's better than me
Change your ways
And I know she's better than me
Better than me
And I know they're better than me
And I know he's better than me

I cannot fuck with no fake shit, uh

Got these hoes in my phone
Each one of them tryna get saved, shit
But I ain't gon' save shit
I cannot fuck with no fake shit, uh

One way flight, no connections

We gon' make up all the time missed
Then I send her back the next day
Hopefully she get the message
Block her number so it go green every time she gon' try to message
Last time, she did me so dirty, time for me to teach a lesson
I know that she gon' regret it, I know she prolly won't get it
Fuck you bitch, now I meant it

[Chorus]
I cannot fuck with no fake shit, uh
I'm tryna get my money up, tryna get paid, shit
She didn't wanna fuck with me way back then

I'm tryna get my money up, tryna get paid, shit
She didn't wanna fuck with me way back then
But I guess that changed, shit
Got these hoes in my phone
Each one of them tryna get saved, shit
But I ain't gon' save shit

[Intro: Usher]
Wishes, wonder, magic, colder

[Verse 1: Usher]
Time stands still, can't explain what I feel
If this is really real, nothing's ever gonna be the same
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
I get to say goodbye to the struggle in life
Say hello to the skies, spread my wings and fly away
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
Even though life's been knocking me down
I have to figure it out, see my way through the doubt
And when it seems I'm lost, turn and found my way
What I got in my hands could be the spark
Turns it all around, could this be happening now?
'Cause all my life I've waited for this day

[Verse 2: Kiana Ledé]
Tell me what do you do when everyone's counting on you?
Thе decisions you make, the givе and the take
The promises kept, and the ones that you break are the hardest to take
But, ohh, we'll always be standing by you
No, I won't give up, I won't give in
'Cause the day that you run might be the day that you win

[Pre-Chorus: Kiana Ledé, Kiana Ledé & Usher, Usher]
Even when life's knocking you down
You always figure it out, see your way through the doubt
And when you're lost I help you find your way
What you got in your hands could be the spark
Turns it all around, is this happening now?
'Cause all my life I've knew we'd see this day
I knew we'd see this day
I knew we both would see this day

[Chorus: Usher & Kiana Ledé, Usher]
You know all your dreams are calling
On this day
It's out there if you want it
Don't be afraid
Believe and know your best is yet to come
'Cause all my life I've waited for this day

[Break: Usher]
Waiting for this day (We've been waiting so long)
Waiting for this day (Ohh)
Waiting for this day
Waiting for this day (Is the present the gift)
Waiting for this day (Or is the present the day?)
Waiting for this day (Oh, oh)

Forget about yesterday (Woah)
It's dead and gone away (Woah)
The only thing that matters is right now (Ooh)
Forget about yesterday (This is our moment)
It's dead and gone away (Baby, let's hold it)
Oh, everything we wanted is happening right now
(Forget about yesterday) It's magical yeah
(It's dead and gone away)
Baby, let's own it (Oh, oh)
Forget about yesterday (Woah, my god)
It's dead and gone away (We waited for this day)
The only thing that matters is right now
All my life I've (All my life I've)
Waited for this (I've waited for this)
We waited for so long, so long we've waited for
This day

[Verse 1]
Moving too fast, they say it won’t last
But I just wanna
Yeah, I just wanna see for myself
The summer days melt, no kiss and no tell
‘Cause I just wanna, yeah, we just wanna
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I been waiting for you, been waiting for me
A familiar feeling between us
Like we’ve been here before
‘Cause we can't control this familiar feeling between us

[Chorus]
We don’t have to say that we’re lovers
Even though we’re touching each other
Can you keep it under the covers?
‘Cause I wanna keep it
Solo where nobody can chime in
We could let ‘em know whеn the time is right
Ooh
For now lets keep it sеcret

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
(ha-ha, ha-ha)
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
(ha-ha, ha-ha)

[Verse 2]
Lemme savor all your flavors
And I don’t wanna, yeah
I don’t wanna share with no one
Feel them watching, but we ain’t talking
Boy, I just wanna, yeah, we just wanna
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I been waiting for you, been waiting for me
A familiar feeling between us
Like we’ve been here before
‘Cause we can't control this familiar feeling between us

[Chorus]
We don’t have to say that we’re lovers
Even though we’re touching each other
Can you keep it under the covers?
‘Cause I wanna keep it
Solo where nobody can chime in

[Bridge]
One day we could tell ‘em all
We could tell ‘em how
We could tell ‘em when
We could tell ‘em what
But for now let’s keep it secret
One day we could reminisce
When nobody knew about the way we kiss
And the way we touch
But for now let’s keep it secret

[Chorus]
We don’t have to say that we’re lovers
Even though we’re touching each other
Can you keep it under the covers?
‘Cause I wanna keep it
Solo where nobody can chime in
We could let ‘em know when the time is right
Ooh
For now lets keep it secret

[Verse 1]
Memories consume, like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

[Chorus]
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I know it's not alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Verse 2]
Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime before
I had no options left again

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to be thе one the battles always choosе
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

[Chorus]
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Bridge]
I'll paint it on the walls 'cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again and this is how it ends

[Chorus]
I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I’m breaking the habit tonight

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(It starts with one) One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (It's so unreal)
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Rememberin' all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

[Chorus]
Said I wouldn't drink, but I did the same day
Shit, I lied to your face like I always do

Now you actin' surprised, but bitch, you always knew
Maybe it's time for me to find somebody else
Like I always do

[Verse 1]
I know you can't believe me 'cause I never tell the truth but, oh
I wish that you could just see that it's only to protect you, no
How many times can somebody want the same pain? (Pain, pain)
When the prеssure put on me, then I changе things
And every time that I run, I know you gon' chase
We always end up right back in the same place

[Pre-Chorus]
You-u-u-u-u, wastin' all my time with you-u-u-u-u
Wishin' I was someone new-ew-ew-ew-ew

Now you actin' surprised, but bitch, you always knew
Maybe it's time for me to find somebody else
Like I always do

Do, do, do, do, do (Uh), like I always do
Do, do, do, do, do (Uh), like I always do

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry, I can't be the me you wanted
I'm about to fall, then you're all in
I'm not the one to solve your problems (No, no)
'Cause I'm fucked up too-oo-oo-oo-oo

[Pre-Chorus]
Wastin' all my time with you-u-u-u-u
Wishin' I was someone new-ew-ew-ew-ew
Stuck up in my ways and you say that you hate it, but
You always knew

[Chorus]
Said I wouldn't drink, but I did the same day
Shit, I lied to your face like I always do
Said I was gon' change, both know that I can't

Lyrics from Snippets

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
-biscuits in the oven
Come and see me

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, open up your bibles, lets listen to the reverent
I'm two numbers ones so together I'm eleven
She's a ten I'm number one, together we eleven
Her girlfriend a seven, send her to seven-eleven
She a tеn, she a seven, that makе 'em seventeen
Let me see your ID, only seventeen?
Eesh, that could have fucked up everything
Nike already don't like me, always had a white tee
Dressed like I'm hypebeast, sign it through my white tee
Don't race against the American dream
Together we like the Kenyan marathon team
Three black rap acts that spit that crack
Never pushed that 'Lac, rather push somethin' German
Lookin' for a Swedish bitch that I could put my sperm in
Preach, my brother, gon' start the sermon
All I see is green, call me Erik Shermon
All I spit is thermal, long-sleeved flannel
When I touch the verse, don't touch the channel
Bought the rat a purse, she keep callin' it Chanel
Never hit a bitch anal, but I run shit annual
Now that's some dumb shit
I never hit a bitch anal, but I run shit, dumb bitch
And I mean that in the nicest sense to the word
Just act like I'm some type of nice sensitive nerd
That don't need female dogs
Cause I done dogged all females
Except for the ones that's only in it for the retail
She see what you got, she see what we sell
Get married so much, I swear them girls on resell
She watchin' the draft, she got your jersey all ready
She 'bout to pick out her crib in Jersey already
She 'bout to be pregnant by Thursday y'all ready?
Congratulations, baby boy, on your new baby boy

[Intro]
Ayo, haha
What's good, Rod?
Shit is cracked right here, it knocks
This to my motherfuckers who is money-hungry right now, yo
Recession is some bullshit, haha
But don't worry, we doin' this shit for the dollars, period

[Chorus]
When the money comin' slow, it's time to roll (Time to roll)
'Cause I gotta go and fetch me some mo'
This money comin' slow, I ain't havin' that (Havin' that)
Said, this money comin' slow, I ain't havin that (Havin' that)
When the money comin' slow, it's time to roll (Time to roll)
'Cause I gotta go and fetch me some mo'
This money comin' slow, I ain't havin' that (Havin' that)
Said, this money comin' slow, I ain't havin that (Here we go, uh)

[Verse 1]
Never start a day with empty pockets
'Cause I seek profit, keepin' work likе a office
Stick-ups, grimy shit, gettin' it all
'Cause I ain't thе type of kid with a regular job
I'm 'bout my dollars like a register be
And if the cops get him, well, he ain't get it from me
I'm never sittin' in the cell, that's a livin' hell
I'm livin' well, buildin' business, call me Stringer Bell
Uh, waitin' in the alley with my hoodie up
'Cause this rapper hustle money ain't good enough
Top dollar, it's whatever with me
'Cause I ain't about college, try and get a degree
I'm 'bout this hustle money, rap money, fast money, cash money
Get in my way and I'ma do you like a crash dummy
I act funny, but don't get up on my bad side
Leave you hospitalized, broken bones and black eyes
'Cause tax high, and sometime the cake low
So I keep a couple homies on the payroll
Roll with hundreds, you know you love it
I make dough, bigger when you poke my stomach, ha
So call me for ya needs, whatever it is
If you need a cracked beat, you get it from Blizz
Mac Miller gettin' money in my hands
And you clowns is lookin' funny when you dance, ya bitch

[Chorus]
When the money comin' slow, it's time to roll (Time to roll)
'Cause I gotta go and fetch me some mo'
This money comin' slow, I ain't havin' that (Havin' that)
Said, this money comin' slow, I ain't havin that (Havin' that)
When the money comin' slow, it's time to roll (Time to roll)
'Cause I gotta go and fetch me some mo'
This money comin' slow, I ain't havin' that (Havin' that)
Said, this money comin' slow, I ain't havin that (Uh, uh)

[Verse 2]
And when the money comin' slow, I'ma pack my shit
Grab a fast, take a piff, and have that flipped in a day or two
Haze and brew got me feelin' days confused
Take your loot, ante up, you gotta pay me
Empty out ya pockets, necklaces and watches
I'm fetchin' me some profit, then I'm gettin' some exotic
'Cause I ain't tryna play with my money like Monopoly
I want a happy lil' end in my biography
A lot to read, chronic greens kids will cop from me
Stockin' cheese 'til I'm doin' this hip-hop for free
Smokin' kush 'til I'm higher than astronomy
They feeds from my jams like I'm spittin' out some poppy seeds
Bars is 

[?] to make me rich
It'll blow your fuckin' mind when you take that hit
You lil' pussies ain't makin' it, take a hint
In this game, we pimps, you gotta pay me, bitch

[Chorus]
When the money comin' slow, it's time to roll (Time to roll)
'Cause I gotta go and fetch me some mo'
This money comin' slow, I ain't havin' that (Havin' that)
Said, this money comin' slow, I ain't havin that (Havin' that)
When the money comin' slow, it's time to roll (Time to roll)
'Cause I gotta go and fetch me some mo'
This money comin' slow, I ain't havin' that (Havin' that)
Said, this money comin' slow, I ain't havin that

Stay relaxed with a hit from the ganja
Calm, cool, collected, told Billy to shoot
Bullet shot through the air; Gimme the loot! Gimme the loot! (Haha)
The bank teller (Teller), well, he took us to the back
Lookin' like a black cat crossed his cat
Well, that's exactly what we goin' for (Uh-huh)

Nights like this make me wish I never fell in love with you
Time flies by, I text, get no reply, get no reply from you (No, no)
You just keep playin' games, things ain't the same for me and you, tell me why
You were my all, but I'm no longer scared, scared of losin' you (Hm-hm, hm-hm, oh no)

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Colors of the sky used to be blue, but now they changin' you
Quick to say I'm wrong, but you're so slow to see it from my view
Love shine like the sun, thеn disappear just like the mornin' dеw
You want loyalty, but you can't have your cake and eat it, too, you know? No

Sleepless nights when you're not around
Who do you fuck when I'm not in town?
My mind is racin', I need to slow down, woah, no (Oh)

Who do you fuck when I'm not in town?
My mind is racin', I need to slow down

But you downtown, out all night
Downtown, out all night

You dey online, but you no dey reply
Too many things goin' through my mind
Got me fucked up, you no dey try

That's when she come and apologize
Don't wanna see you with another guy
You no dey fuck? Look me in the eyes
Mi ah no dey fire, I hope you realize (Oh, oh)
Times like these, they make me feel like seh

You were my all, but I'm no longer scared, scared of losin' you
(Oh no, no, no-no)

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Is it time for give it up now?
Was it love or was it lust now?
Tell me who the fuck I'm 'posed to trust now?
Gyal shine like bust down
Girl why let me down?
Come wine on me now, now
There was a time I thought we'd make it through
You want loyalty, but you can't have your cake and eat it too, you know? (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

But you seem to be confused
We make love on Saturday

[Chorus]
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Why would I think we could turn this into somethin' cool?
Say it's better when I know you really bluffin', ooh-oh-oh

Ghetto love affair

I'm all the sudden aware, baby, oh-oh

I was unaware, ooh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Treat me like I'm nothin'

Damn it, I need you baby

From now you're mine and no one else's

[Chorus]

If it were always sunshine
Tell me, would you miss the rain?
I kinda like the rain sometimes
Every now and again (Now and again)
Ooh, tell me how you'd feel
If it were always the same

[Refrain: Trey Songz]
'Cause in reality, love and happiness live next to pain
Goin' through changes

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]

You turned around, looked the other way, yeah

We should say now
I feel like we been runnin' from the brand new

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
You know, you know, you know
We can make it through the rain
You know, you know, you know
We can make it through the rain
You know, you know, you know
We can make it through the rain
You know, you know, you know
We can make it

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
You can make it through bad weather
I can make it through whatever
She choosin' me, she so selective
Diamonds hit but nothin' sexual
Where will you be when the sun dies?
When there's rainfall on your blue skies
Got your own scene, feel your heart changin'
Got your own scene, live a fantasy

[Bridge: Swae Lee]
You can use me 'til you lose, lose me
You can use me 'til you lose, lose me
You can use me 'til you lose, lose me
You can use me 'til you lose, lose me

It's pourin' down on me, I won't complain (Nah)
'Cause I kinda like the rain sometimes
Every now and again (Now and again)
Ooh, said you loved me one time
(Said you loved me one time)
But did that season change? (Oh)
I been on the frontline (Yeah)
Since this love war began, yeah
And we could try to clean it up
But the stain still remains

'Cause in reality, love and happiness live next to pain
Goin' through changes

[Chorus]
Why don't we talk no more?
You told me you needed space, yeah
Traded my time for yours
Now all you want is a break
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Don't you know I love you crazy?
It ain't okay just to leave it like that
It ain't no way, look, baby
Let you go, I had to be a maniac
Oh, yeah, oh yeah
I been blowin' up your phone
I don't care, I don't care

[Chorus]
Why don't we talk no more? (Won't talk)
You told me you needed space, yeah (Yeah)
Traded my time for yours (Damn)
Now all you want is a break (What's up with that though?)
Tired of fightin' love (Ooh-woah)
Feelin' like I can't win (Can't win, can't win, can't win)
It's just like a tug of war
Tug of war, ooh, ooh-ooh

[Post-Chorus]
I keep on tuggin', you pullin' away (Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah)
I keep on pullin, you pushin' away (Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah)

You said you needed your space (Need you space)
But you didn't mind when I needed mine, traded my time (Time for you)
Yeah, now what you say? You need a break, oh-woah
I'm pullin' for love, tell me why you pushin' away?
I'm tired of fightin' love (So tired, oh)
Feelin' like I can't win (I can't win)
It's just like a tug of war (Tug of war)

[Verse 1]
I been givin' it some thought
Yeah, I been livin' with it
Oh, I been dwellin' on it

Now when you need me
You can find me, girl, for life, for life

You say you want all the smoke
Well, I got this fire for you, I got desire
If you do me the honor to be mine, I'll be yours
Woman, come and get all this love

[Verse 2]
Truly, them other girls, I swear they never do me
The way that you do, baby, 'cause you take it so personal
To be the best I've ever known, I've ever seen
I've ever shown the parts of me that I keep close
It's scary, the weight I've always carried
You relieve that, I believe that this was meant to be
Your energy's out of this world, call you ET
You heavenly like G-O-D, so I receive that

[Chorus]
I'm talkin' that one on one
I'm talkin' that all you need
I'm talkin' that all you want

[Interlude]
...looking up and laughing
Them out in VA, all them women over there lookin' for a man
They see you by yourself, "Hey, how you..."
Everybody know, everybody know, but they always do that
Everybody do that
No, everybody don't do that
You be clean and pressed down
And have your hair and stuff lookin' nice and you be thinkin' you cute
And that's another way young men, "What I do that for?"
Had to watch myself everywhere I go
If you can't help if you go over there and somebody, "How you doin'?"
You got it, but you still got swag
I don't say nothin', I don't want you sayin' nothin'

Greg know how that go
Hey Greg, they grab the wheelchair if you ain't careful, right?
Nah, I don't wanna havе to deal with all that

The city is now in distress as calls cry out loud
Fury pouring into thе streets over the killing of Breonna Taylor (Say their name, say their name, say their name)
Reporting to you live, we've now seen 

[?] demonstrations everywhere, all across America (No peace, no peace)
Atatiana Jefferson was in her home when she was murdered by law enforcement
Yep, another sad story today as another black man dies at the hands of police offers
We can't breathe

[Verse 1]
I never thought I'd find a love like this
I thought I had it all, but I didn't
It makes me wonder
Where you've been all my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Never felt so familiar
Damn, I know this is real love
When I look into your eyes
It keeps me up at night
I can't explain the pride
But now, I realize

[Chorus]
I know a love, nothin' compares to you
Somethin' so real, it make me feel brand new
Wanna be the one to catch you when you fall
I'm gon' be here, that's forever, that's for sure
'Cause I know a love that make a man feel good
I know a love I never knew I could
I'm so thankful, you're a blessin' from above
So amazin', now I know a better love

[Verse 2]
No better feelin' than the one like this (No)
I thought I had it all, but I didn't (No)
It makes me wonder (Oh yeah)
Where you've been all my life

[Pre-Chorus]
And it feels so familiar
Damn, I know that this is the realest love
When I look into your eyes
It keeps me up at night
I can't explain the pride
But now, I realize

[Chorus]
I know a love, nothin' compares to you
Somethin' so real, it make me feel brand new (Wanna be, yeah)
Wanna be the one to catch you when you fall (When you fall)

'Til I held you in my arms (Oh, now I know a love)

[Chorus]
I know a love, nothin' compares to you (Compare)
Somethin' so real, it make me feel brand new (Wanna be)
Wanna be the one to catch you when you fall (Oh woah)

[Intro: Jimmie Hoffa]
This one's for the struggle
This one's for the hustlers

[Pre-Chorus: Jimmie Hoffa]
I like my Hennessy straight, baby, without no chaser
Got no time for love, 'cause I'm in love with the paper
So go 'head, leave, I'll be right here when you wake up
Still hustlin' every single bit of that 

[?]

[Chorus: Jimmie Hoffa]
'Cause I'm on my grind (My grind, my grind, my grind, my grind, my grind, my grind)
Because i'm on my grind (My grind, my grind, my grind, my grind, my grind, my grind)
Because I'm on my—

[Verse 1: Jimmie Hoffa]
Yeah, I struggled a lot (Yeah), so I'm puffin' on pot
And inhalin' the smoke, and not carin' at all (See)
I got problems, but a bitch ain't one ('Cause)
If she's in love with mе, then the bitch ain't dumb (Ha)
'Cause I nеver had an ex that i ain't made cum
Just like I never had a slut that I kissed with tongue
See, there's rules to the G code, and every G knows
You treat a ride-or-die different than your ski ho (Yes)
So I got three hoes that give me deep throat
And then they leave 'til the next time I creep though (Wow)
I got a mean flow, and way too much ambition (Plus)
Marine's instinct, and hustler's intuition (Continue)
I got a fighter's heart (And?), and a killer's vision (What else?)
And a soldier's pride (And?), and a teacher's wisdom
And a legend's mind, and nothin' else is missin' (Except?)
Except for open ears, I like when people listen

[Pre-Chorus: Jimmie Hoffa & Mac Miller]
I like my Hennessy straight, baby, without no chaser
Got no time for love, 'cause I'm in love with the paper (Yo, Jimmie)
So go 'head, leave, I'll be right here when you wake up (You crazy, boy)
Still hustlin' every single bit of that 

[?]

[Chorus: Jimmie Hoffa, Mac Miller, Jimmie Hoffa & Mac Miller]

And when nothin' seem right, I'ma take a left
Workin', movin', makin', checks, grindin' for this paper fest (Yeah)
So 

[?] the time (Time, time, time)
I'm on my grind (My grind, my grind, uh-huh)
Never in recline (Recline), it starts to hurt my spine (Spine)
But I know it takes some workin' for the shine (Uh-huh)
Everyone in my whole damn camp eatin'
Know we stay feastin' with our own hands, feedin'
Y'all ain't even cheatin', get up on our level (Haha)
Yeah, we got drive like the pedal to the metal (Vroom)
And y'all just neutral (Neutral), cruise control (Cruise control)
Same damn speed, movin' super slow (Haha)
When I'm sleepin' in the studio, I'm goin' hard like the Steelers in the Super Bowl
I'm on my grind

[Pre-Chorus: Jimmie Hoffa]
I like my Hennessy straight, baby, without no chaser
Got no time for love, 'cause I'm in love with the paper
So go 'head, leave, I'll be right here when you wake up
Still hustlin' every single bit of that

Beedie, Crack, Mac Miller. Jimmie Hoffa

Ayy, low key when I'm blowin' the haze

[?] the state I'm in
I'm for that gold medal spot, boy, I play it to win

Uh, Rocky Stallone boxin' a pro
So if you steppin' up, you'll get knocked in ya dome
You got style I can mop the floor with
'Cause y'all just bug like locust and roaches
Walk into a restaurant, always spittin' game on the hostess
Approach with swagger, take notice, never lose focus
I'm gettin' dough up in my pockets
It's all about the profit when you dealin' with the chronic
Got a backpack 

[?] scale
My old heads told me, "If you look back, you're frail"
So no lookin', I'm ready to go
Mind on the money, head on my dough
Me, Hoff and Beedie ready to blow
And y'all act like we haven't said it befo'
So from Pittsburgh to Boston
No options, it's hip-hop to the coffin, bitch

[Intro]
Who owns my heart?

[Verse 1]
Creation shows me what to do
I'm dancing on the floor with you
And when you touch my hand
I go crazy, yeah
The music tells me what to feel
I like you now, but is it real?
By the time we say goodnight
I'll know if this is right

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I feel you (Feel you) pumping through my veins
Am I into you, or is the music to blame?

[Chorus]
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
'Cause the way you got your body moving's
Got me confused, and I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
You know I wanna believe that we're a masterpiece
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark
Who owns my heart?

[Verse 2]
The room is full but all I see is
The way your eyes just blaze through me
Like fire in the dark
We're like living art

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And it hits me like a tidal wave
Are you feeling me, or is the music to blame?

[Chorus]
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
'Cause the way you got your body moving's
Got me confused, and I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
You know I wanna believe that we're a masterpiece
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark
Who owns my heart?

[Bridge]
So come on, baby
Keep provoking me
Keep on roping me
Like a rodeo
Baby, pull me close
C'mon, here we go, here we go, here we go

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And it hits me like a tidal wave
Are you feeling me, or is the music to blame?

[Chorus]
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
'Cause the way you got your body moving's
Got me confused, and I can't tell if it's the beat or sparks
Who owns my heart?
Is it love, or is it art?
You know I wanna believe that we're a masterpiece
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark
Who owns my heart?

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
I need you the m-, I need you, I need you the m-, I need you
I need the m-, the m-, the m-, the m-, the m-, the m-
I need you the m-, I need you, I need you the m-
I need you, I need the m-, the m-, the m-, the m-, the m-, the m-
You the m-, the m-, the m-
I need you the most

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it
See, I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, can’t deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me, where are you now that I need you? Where are you now?

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Where are you now that I need ya? Couldn't find you anywhеre
When you broke down I didn't lеave ya, I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I gave you attention when nobody else was payin', mm'
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you sayin'? To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playin', that's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin', oh Lord

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I need you the I need you, I need you the I need you, I need you, where are you now that I need ya?
I need you the m-, I need you, I need you the m-, I need you
I need the m-, the m-, the m-, the m-, the m-, the m-

[Verse 1]
Every time that you leave my house
I fear that your truck flips, or crashes
I’m always assuming the worst
It’s not healthy to be so fucking anxious and desperate
My train of thought always derails

[Chorus]
All is calm at the moment
Nothing’s wrong as of now
But my heart drops when the telephone rings
“I’m not sure you’re the one.”
Do you think that it’s time to let our lives divide?

[Verse 2]
I’ll reflect where we met
Back at the restaurant where we worked
Remember our booth in the back room?
Things were much simpler then
Post college daydreams on Ivy
Learning your curves in the bed

[Chorus]
All is calm at the moment
Nothing’s wrong as of now
But my heart drops when the telephone rings
“I’m not sure you’re the one.”
If you think that it’s time then let our lives divide

[Verse 1]
I still recall the time when I was 17
The officer who warned you both about me
And in the years before
I knew you’d seen it, too
The warning signs were scars of future rescue

[Chorus]
Tell her later
The words of gratitude escape me
Tell her later
The shit I put you through
I wish that I could take it back
Was I ever hard to love?
My life is owed to you
This all is tribute

[Verse 2]
Father if you are the one thе apple fell so close to
I undеrstand the things you did
What’s going wrong?
And who else is to blame?
“Our son is gone. Our son is gone!”
Never thought I’d want to

[Chorus]
Tell her later
The words of gratitude escape me
Tell her later
The shit I put you through
I wish that I could take it back
Was I ever hard to love?
My life is owed to you
This all is tribute

[Break]
How did you get any sleep at night?
How did you get any sleep at night?
How did you get any sleep at night?
How did you get any sleep at night?

[Chorus]
Tell her later
Tell her later
The shit I put you through
I wish that I could take it back
Was I ever hard to love?
My life is owed to you
This all is tribute

[Outro]
And I wish that I could take it back
I wish that I could take it back
I wish that I could take it back
Was I ever hard to love?

[Verse]
Tension flowing through my veins and I can feel it
I want to cut it out so I can see it
But that’s the way I always know
Even now, this uncertainty soon will pass

Hours spent inside the room that got me sober
Praying the dopamine would find me sooner
But that’s the gash I had to sew on this road
I just have to own where it goes

[Chorus]
Soft manipulating, hot and cold
Kept my family waiting long enough
Careless and self centered ways I behaved stained our home
I found a photograph my father took of someone I don’t know
I don’t recognize

[Verse]
Lovers, and everyone who fought for me to beat it
How could I commit when I didn’t feel it?
I wish that I could give you back stolen time
Maybe in the end, you’ll get mine

[Bridge]
I'd kill the light when everyone was home
I didn't want them to know where I was
Alive at night
I snuck around to be the very thing you tried preventing
Maybe in the end, I’ll give it back
Maybe in the end, you’ll get it back
You’ll get it back

[Chorus]
Soft manipulating hot and cold
Kept my family waiting long enough
I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know
Careless and self-centered ways I behaved stained our home
Found a photograph my brother took of someone I don’t know
I don’t recognize anymore

[Lyrics from the Jimmy Fallon snippet]
Despite the things you say to me
Who don't mean it either babe
We'll go down in history yeah
We'll go down in history here
Forever and eternity
Keeping your memory
We've been through it all
You're in my heart
I give you mine
We'll go down in history
We'll go down in history
We'll go down in history
We'll go down in history
Bought it, stole it
Loved it, lost it so that I could get it
I don't know where to start
Oh, from the bottom of my heart
I want you
I never get enough
Another one bites thе dust
So are you gonna cry, cry
If so, I won't stick around
And watch you, oh no

[Verse 1]
One foot in the door
I’ve been trying
To get your attention
Is it working out yet?
Love me or love me not
I don’t care anymore
But baby I’ve been dying
To get your attention
And I was like

[Pre-Chorus]
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
They say only the good die young
That just ain't us
Plus you're having too much fun
You're not in a rush

[Chorus]
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive

[Post-Chorus]
My boyfriend's back and he's cooler than ever
There's no more night, blue skies forever

[Verse 2]
One day or one night
I’ve been trying
To make a connection
Is it working or not?
Love me or love me not
I don’t care anymore
Cause babe I’ve been dying
To taste your affection
And I was like

[Pre-Chorus]
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
They say only the good die young
That just ain't us
Plus you're having too much fun
You're not in a rush

[Chorus]
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive

[Post-Chorus]
My boyfriend's back and he's cooler than ever
There's no more night, blue skies forever
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse: A$AP Rocky & A$AP Ferg]
Cut it up man (Grrr)
... on a stank face (Hoo!)
Always on time with the big face (Why?)
Freak ass bitch on the same face (Why?)
Blatt one banana clips
Blatt at a Harlem picnic
Flip shorty got a motorola fancy kick
Listen thirty-three bitches-

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Happy birthday

[Chorus]
That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

[Verse 1]
Don't let this go to your head
But you're the best I've ever had
Not to mention that thing is swollen
You got me oh so in a trance
Something like a ziploc, but a lip lock
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wrist watch
Oh so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh

[Chorus]
That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

[Verse 2]
Got me tossing turning in the bed
Your place is where I'd rather be instead
You don't know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline
Ooh when you got me in a gridlock, what a great spot
With a turned up kind of loving, it just won't stop
No, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh-wee

[Chorus]
That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

[Bridge]
Oh baby, holding back the faces I would make
I'm a fan and you're the rockstar, making it hard on me
Visualise a monster, cause you're too bad for me
Shot that arrow I'm hit, need you right near me
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, no no
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, ooh

[Chorus]
That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

[Verse 1]

But to you, they were everything we were
They meant more than every word
Now I know just what you love me for

[Pre-Chorus]
Take all the money you want from me

My diamonds leave with you
You’re never gonna hear my heart break
Never gonna move in dark ways

Material love won't fool me
When you’re not here, I can't breathe
Think I always knew

Shake it off, shake the fear of feeling lost
Always me that pays the cost
I should never trust so easily
You lied to me, lied to me
Then left with my heart 'round your chest

[Verse 1]
I won't let the night stand in my way
I know what I want, I know what I can, yeah
I'm only here to find you, you
All I need is you by my side
All I wanna do is lay down next you

[Chorus]
'Cause all I need is one love, one love, one heart
'Cause all I need is one love, one love, one heart
Baby, give it to me
'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby, no-no-nobody, has got what I need
'Cause I don't want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby, no-no-nobody, has got what I need tonight

[Verse 2]
See I've made mistakes time after timе, time, time
But no, not today
Won't leavе 'til I find what I'm looking for
I'm only here to find you, you
All I need is you by my side
All I wanna do
Is dance under the moon

[Chorus]
'Cause all I need is one love, one love, one heart
'Cause all I need is one love, one love, one heart
Baby, give it to me

[Produced by Benny Blanco]

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Chorus]
Cause I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby, it’s keeping me dry
I put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You know exactly why

[Pre-Chorus]
When the wind blows and the sun goes away on the sinful, stormy day
It's what it's for yeah, it’s what it's for yeah
And as it pours down, the water sprinkles off my chest jacket slow, yeah, jacket slow, yeah
Whenever do I ever, do I ever want this to faze me?
Whenever do I ever, do I want this thing to make me?
Cause the fame and the money and the girls drive you crazy
And all the he said, she said, I'm thinking maybe, just put on my

[Chorus]
Cause I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby, it's keeping me dry
I put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You know exactly why

[Verse 1]
But, as I look around I see
Well nothing can never change me, yeah
Well all I gotta do is stay me
Let the rest do the work and I'll show that I'll be fine, be fine

[Pre-Chorus]
When the wind blows and the sun goes away on the sinful, stormy day
It's what it’s for yeah, it’s what it's for yeah
And as it pours down, the water sprinkles off my chest jacket slow, yeah, jacket slow, yeah
Whenever do I ever, do I ever want this to faze me?
Whenever do I ever, do I want this thing to make me?
Cause the fame and the money and the girls drive you crazy
And all the he said, she said, I’m thinking maybe, just put on my

[Chorus]
Cause I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby, it's keeping me dry
I put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You know exactly why

[Bridge]
Just put on my, just put on my, just put on my

[Chorus]
Cause I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby, it’s keeping me dry
I put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You know exactly why

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
Oh no no, oh no no, she's confidеnt

Feels so good damn (oh, yeah, yeah)
And I don't know why
I'm addicted (oh, yeah, yeah)
Something like an addict
Got me twisted (oh, yeah, yeah)
But still I gotta have it

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Explosive, explosive (yeah, yeah)
I could still smell her perfume
It's not hard to notice, that I'm open
Hypnotised by the way you move

[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]
Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa masterpiece
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident

Oh no no, oh no no, she's confident
Oh no no, oh no no (and she's fine with that/and I'm down with that)

On the way from LA with a fifty

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Yo...

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Watch as the room rocks, mentally moonwalk
Mixed Media slang banging in your boom box
Verbal violence, lyrical stylist
In a time when rock hip-hop rhymes are childish

You can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty
Rapping to a beat doesn't make you an MC
With your lack of skill and facility, you're killing me
And a DJ in the group just for credibility

I heard that some of you are getting help with your rhymes
You're not an MC if someone else writes your lines
Rapping over rock doesn't make you a pioneer
‘Cause rock and hip-hop have collaborated for years

But now they're getting randomly mixed and matched up
All after a fast buck, and all the tracks suck
So how does it stack up? None of it's real
You want to be an MC, you've got to study the skill

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up! Step, step up!

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
So, you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity
But mentally, you don't have the hip hop energy
With a tendency to make up stories (Bullshit)
Sounding like the only hip hop you've heard is top 40

And your record company is completely missing it
All the kids are dissing it for not being legitimate
So in a battle, you can't hack it, react with whack shit
And get smacked with verbal back flips

Get your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts
It's taken decades for MC's to establish this
You're new to hip-hop, and welcome if your serious
But not on the mic, leave that to the experienced

[Break]
Using the waves of sound
The true master paralyzes his opponents
Leaving him vulnerable to attack

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up! Step, step up!

Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up! Step, step up! Step up!

[Bridge]
After years of pain-staking research by the world's leading sound scientists
We here at the sound institute have invented a reliable audio weapons system
Actual movement of musical sound in space used to carefully attack and neutralize the cellular structure of the human body
And the question must be asked…

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up! Step, step up!

Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up! Step, step up!

[Outro]
Mix Media
Step Up the microphone
And you do it like this
And you do it like
Step Up the microphone
Mix Media
And you do it like this
Mix Media
Step Up the microphone
And you do it like this
Mix Media
Step Up the microphone
And you do it like this

[Verse 1]
He used to call me DN
That stood for Deadly Nightshade
'Cause I was filled with poison
But blessed with beauty and rage
Jim told me that, he hit me and it felt like a kiss
Jim brought me back, reminded me of when we were kids

[Chorus]
With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolеnce

[Verse 2]
He used to call mе poison
Like I was Poison Ivy
I could have died right there
'Cause he was right beside me
Jim raised me up, he hurt me but it felt like true love
Jim taught me that, loving him was never enough

[Chorus]
With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence

[Bridge]
We could go back to New York
Loving you was really hard
We could go back to Woodstock
Where they don't know who we are
Heaven is on Earth
I would do anything for you, baby
Blessed is this union
Crying tears of gold like lemonade

[Interlude]
I love you the first time, I love you the last time
I'll be your princesa, you'll get me in my white lines
'Cause I'm your jazz singer and you're my cult leader
I love you forever, I love you forever

[Chorus]
With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence

[Verse 1]
I've seen many people
There are so many people
Some are much younger people
And some are so old

I've seen many places
There are so many places
And where are the people going?
Will they choose the road?

[Chorus]
I've packed my bags and I've got my freedom
I've sacked the rules so I don't have to heed them
I'll bet on a chance if I've just got one
I'll throw out the plans and live with no burden

[Verse 2]
I have but a lifetime
Seems so long but it flies by
And in the moments passing
I'll bear no load
I have yet to wander
Many miles far yonder
And with so much left to ponder
I choose the road

[Chorus]
I've packed my bags and I've got my freedom
I've sacked the rules so I don't have to heed them
I'll bet on a chance if I've just got one
I'll throw out the plans and live with no burden

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I've packed my bags and I've got my freedom
I've sacked the rules so I don't have to heed them
I'll bet on a chance if I've just got one
I'll throw out the plans and live with no burden

Okay, it's Childish Gambino, homegirl drop it like the NASDAQ
Move white girls like there's coke up my asscrack
Move black girls cause, man, fuck it, I'll do either
I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runnin' PETA
In Adidas, with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me
My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery
This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef
My dick is like an accent mark, it's all about the over Es
Hot like a parked car
I sound weird like nigga with hard R
Fly like the logo on my cousin's four forty
Eatin' Oreos like thesе white girls that blow me
Vodka for my ladies, whiskеy for a grown man
Hangin' in the islands, lookin' for Earl like toe jam
I made the beat retarded, so I'm callin' it a slow jam
Butcher and I know it, man, kill beef, go ham
These rappers are afraid of him
Cause I'm a beast, bitch, Gir, Invader Zim
Gambino is a call girl, fuck you, pay me
Brand new whip for these niggas like slavery
They told me I was awful man, that shit did not phase me
Tell me how I suck again, my memory is hazy
"You're my favorite rapper, now" Yeah, dude, I better be
Or you can fuckin' kiss my ass, Human Centipede
You wanna see my girl? I ain't that dumb
You wanna see my girl? Check Maxim
"Man, why does every black actor gotta rap some?"
I don't know, all I know is I'm the best one
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin' everything you muthafuckas talk about
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin' everything you muthafuckas talk about
You know these rapper dudes talk shit, start killin'
Fuck that, got goons like an arch-villain
I'm from the South, ain't got no accent, don't know why
So this rap is child's play, I do my name like Princess Di
Yeah, they say they want the realness, rap about my real life
Told me I should just quit "first of all, you talk white!
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet"
Rap's stepfather, yeah, you hate me but you will respect
I put in work, ask Ludwig
Put my soul on the track like shoes did
Played this for my cousin, now he can't even think straight
Black and white music? Now, nigga, that's a mixtape
Shout out to my blerds, they represent the realness
Shout out to Gambino, girls, my dick is in the building
I know you hate me cause your little cousin play me
I like black girls who nerdy, but when they dance they be sayin' "owww"
Sorry for who followed me
Chillin' with a Filipino, at your local Jollibee
Yeah, I'm in her ass like sodomy
So if you see my hand under the table, don't bother me
I don't talk soft, that's that other guy
I'm screamin' "What the fuck is up?" like I ain't seen the sky
And shit I'm doin' this year, Insanity
Made the beat then murdered it, Casey Anthony
These rappers don't know what to do
Cause all I did was act me like a Loony Tune
I'll give you all of me until there's nothing left
I swear this summer will be summer camp, bitch

[Intro: Lil Yachty]
(Enrgy made this one)
On my momma, I just, nigga
Nigga just got off his ass
Flew up out here to really talk some shit with these niggas (Frrp)
You wanna talk, you can talk hella shit (Boat, Boat)
On God, look, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Come and suck on my jeweler's dick
My doctor almost died, I made my bitch go and clean his spit
Yeah, on my momma, I need him here
He gon' write the scripts 'til he dip to go hang with Kobe
Wraith pulled me over, no question, he didn't owe me
Damn, this bitch just called my name like she really know me
Ain't a rap nigga in the world that can say they hold me
I just got a S-I-G in the back foldin'
I buy SRTs in my sleep, it didn't hurt my pockets
I just saw a sealed pint of Act' and it hurt my sockets
Real VVS on my bitch, ain't no heart lockets
I live on the lake, leave the crib and forgot to lock it
It's okay, I got cameras there
Any my brothers sleepin' upstairs, we got hammers there
And my other brother try to close, he got Pamela there
Good with the block like Tyson Chandler was there

[Verse 2: Rio Da Yung OG]
Forty-four, doin' the round
Breakin' hearts with a Chrome Hearts sweater on
Breakin' charts on house arrest, I ain't left from home
Takin' narcs, I'm pourin' codeine in styrofoams
I keep a cup of lean on me, don't wanna die alone
What the fuck is one pint? I wanna buy a load
I got the plug to send them bricks, I'm tryna find Lil Boat
Tired of buyin' jewelry and cars, I'm finna buy a goat
Shit, sixty pointers in my ear
I can buy like ten pairs, shit, it won't hurt me
Told Double my next piece gon' be thirty for thirty
Me and Mike takin' blues, goin' thirty for thirty
Ain't got no feelings but I told my lil' bitch it's gon hurt if you hurt me
The funeral home'll prolly run out of dirt if you murk me
Start my day off with a six of some Purp and them Perkies
If the pastor sold dope I walk in the church with a turkey

[Verse 3: Veeze]
Gang, gang
Rio just put on me a hundred racks, fresh out the bank
Two Gs just put on me, pourin' drank right out the pint
I got bitches sellin' pussy, look like Tyra Banks
I'm rockin' Chrome Hearts, shootin' basketball just like I'm Drake
This shit ain't nothin' to my niggas
Youngest nigga in my crew, got like six figures
I been drippin' since the Trues with the deep stitchin'
Every time he think about his bro he reminiscin'
Boy, we don't shoot up no houses, we hit niggas
Boy, I been sippin' dirty water with my Flint niggas
Ayy, cuz', I just made a lot of blues with my Crip niggas
Blood, I could never be no bool with no snitch niggas
I need a Wockhardt pool so I could swim in it
I'm 'bout to fill a fuckin' coupe with like ten bitches
We just made a pop pitch black like a ten attrition
I been in the back just wrappin' work like I'm big Tiger

[Verse 4: RMC Mike]
Just got my dick sucked by a caucasian
Glock hit him from three different ways, he call all angles
Walkin' through the set with 'seppes on, buyin' Palm Angels
Lil' bitch been chasin' me for years, she got strong ankles
SZA, lemme see that watch one time, I need some motivation
I was totin' traps and sellin' dope while you was roller skatin'
Got a bitch pregnant in September, had a COVID baby
Crazy thinkin' 'bout the situation, we ain't have no relation
Yachty, lemme see that anchor chain, I'm tryna fuck an actress
I just placed six thousand in some chains for a fuckin' mattress
Shoot your baby K with no aim, I bust it backwards
Spice talkin', got the ghetto boys movin' up the ladder
Hold on, I ain't done yet
I just finished me a lil' bitch, Mortal Kombat
My daddy caught a body with this Glock, it's a compact
Add another body to the count, just take the gun back

[Verse 5: Louie Ray]
Keep up, the way that we been goin', we ahead, ahead
Nigga, just five years ago, I scatter it
We was droppin' Act' like droppin' trash in the trash can
Ooh, yeah, it was nothin' to it
Told her that her pussy ain't shit unless I nut into it
I can't really do no extra shit, I do enough movin'
I would go and buy another brick but ain't enough movin'
I heard Flint niggas gettin' love but do too much shootin'
You ain't really active like we is, you do too much coolin'
Droolin', park my car wherever 'til I move it
I'm nasty, fartin', out to eat and don't excuse it
Bro, I hate that I can buy whatever now 'cause I abuse
Order pint just to pour four-fours just to do it
Buyin' jewelry 'cause I put myself on off of music
Take my Perc' fast 'cause I'm already high and I might lose it
It's a hunnid cash and I can count it out to you to prove it

[Verse 6: GrindHard E]
It's amazin', I'm still out here dodgin' dope cases
I drive a 2020 Benz, same color as a raisin
Louie spit a Perc' 30 wavy and made me take it
Three-five, a A1 in the water, had to face it
Had my crib slappin' like the car, I guess that's why they raid me
When I was sellin' dope I had a couple fiends that stay with me
Ten thousand dollars in a day, you can't make a G
Two hunnid a gram and I'm stiff, you gotta come to me
It's a hustle, ain't no love, my G
Got my old and my new bitch, they baby daddy can't fuck with me
G-R-I-N-DHard, that shit stuck with me

[Intro]
C-c-c-c-come on, baby
Come on-come on-come on, baby

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
I see you on the street, and you walk on by
You make me wanna hang my head down and cry
If you gave me half a chance
You'd see my desire burning inside of me
But you choose to look the other way

[Pre-Chorus]
I've had to work much harder than this
For something I want
Don't try to resist me

[Chorus]
Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darling
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

[Verse 2]
I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes
You look a little sad, boy, I wonder why
I follow you around, but you can't see
You're too wrappеd up in yourself to notice
So you choose to look thе other way
Well, I've got something to say

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try to run, I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying
You've got to

So let's get together and end global warming

[Verse 1]
I'm Miss American Dream, since I was 17
Don't matter if I step on the scene, or sneak away to the Philippines
They're still gon' put pictures of my derriere in the magazines
You want a piece of me? (You want a piece of me?)
I'm Miss Bad Media Karma
Another day, another drama
Guess I can't see the harm in working and being a mama
And with a kid on my arm, I'm still an exceptional earner
You want a piece of me?

[Chorus]
I'm Mrs. Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous
(You want a piecе of me?)
I'm Mrs. 'Oh my God, That Britney's Shamelеss'
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. 'Extra! Extra! This Just In'
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. 'She's Too Big, Now She's Too Thin'
(You want a piece of me?)

[Verse 2]
I'm Mrs. 'You want a piece of me?'
Trying, and pissing me off
Well, get in line with the paparazzi who's flipping me off
Hoping I'll resort to some havoc, end up settling in court
Now, are you sure you want a piece of me?
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. 'Most Likely to Get on the TV For Strippin' on the Streets When Gettin' the Groceries'
Now, for real, are you kiddin' me?
No wonder there's panic in the industry, I mean, please
Do you want a piece of me?

[Chorus]
I'm Mrs. 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous'
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. 'Oh my God, That Britney's Shameless'
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. 'Extra! Extra! This Just In'
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. 'She's Too Big, Now She's Too Thin'
(You want a piece of me?)

[Breakdown]
I'm Miss American Dream, since I was 17
Don't matter if I step on the scene, or sneak away to the Philippines
They're still gon' put pictures of my derriere in the magazines
You want a piece of me, me, me?

[Chorus]
I'm Mrs. 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous'
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. 'Oh my God, That Britney's Shameless'
(You want a piece of me?)

Walking softly through my door
Come on in, my sweet
How have you been?
You're so nice
But tonight, we're gonna be more than just friends

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I recall the days and ways of love we made
I still feel the heat when we share each other
Don't you feel the magic? The mystery's in the air
Let's go down to lover's lane (With the love we shared)
With the love we shared

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Let's make the time tonight
Reminisce oh so right

Here we are again, come on, fly into my heart

I recall the days and ways of love we made
I still feel the heat when we share each other

[Verse 3: Milk Dee]
Boom! M to the I to the L to the K
MC M-I is the shit I used to say
And when I reminisce, I reminisce about a song that was hittin'
And all the skins I was gettin'
But now I'll do a stunt, but I won't do a stunt
Girls in the back try to flake but they can't front
It's the Milk and the Giz that they're missin'
We get the cuties reminiscin', listen

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]

Let's make the time tonight
Oh
While the feeling's right
Ooh
Reminisce on the love we had

[Verse 1]
I know that we've been here before
The candle light and you
Walking softly through my door
Come on in, my sweet
How have you been?
You're so nice
But tonight, we're gonna be more than just friends

[Pre-Chorus]
I recall the days and ways of love we made
I still feel the heat when we share each other
Don't you feel the magic? The mystery's in the air
Let's go down to lover's lane (With the love we shared)
With the love we shared

[Chorus]
Let's make the time tonight
Reminisce oh so right
Reminisce on the love we had
Make the time tonight
Reminisce, reminisce, reminisce
Let's make the time tonight
Reminisce oh so right
Reminisce on the love we had
Make the time tonight

[Verse 2]
I can see you standing there alone
Like an angel trying to find his way home
I don't remember, how we fell apart
Here we are again, come on, fly into my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I recall the days and ways of love we made
I still feel the heat when we share each other
Don't you feel the magic? The mystery's in the air
Let's go down to lover's lane (With the love we shared)
With the love we shared

[Chorus]
Let's make the time tonight
While the feeling's right
Reminisce on the love we had
Reminisce, reminisce

Now that I know I'm gonna make love to you

Then it won't be wrong, baby
'Cause we belong together, baby

Smile at me, smile at me

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
We’re always livin' so crazy and sexy and cool
And we begin to love it
Watchin' all of the heartache and pain of the world
And thinkin' nothin of it
And baby I got love for you
And I know that you got me, baby
But every time the sun shines bright
It gets so cloudy, yeah

Sometimes the Rule don't mind the rain
It kinda feels like I'm drownin' in the Lord's pain
Until the sun comes out and shines again
Smile, give me reason to keep believin'
That everything ain't misleadin'
And I, kiss them clouds on them rainy days
And, smile for you when ya skies are gray
Babe, 'cause I'm a tear drop away from cryin'
And a few shots away from dyin'
Dear Lord, would you shower my pain
Let it rain, let it rain on me?
While I cherish the air I breathe
I'm an angel, that can't soar, can't fly
And I imagine the Lord knows why

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Ja Rule]
It's just those rainy days
Spend a lifetime tryin' to wash away
Until the sun comes out and shines again

All of those rainy days

Until the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
I feel like an angel
With my broken wings
So I can soar again
Lord, let me in
Baby, through all the passion the pain and the hurt
I feel like I'm fallin', yeah
Makin' clothes and all for those that
Spread love
And for those who can't take it
Stand up
Baby, we gonna make it
In the words of Marvin Gaye
War is not the answer
Oh, it's just those rainy days
Smile for me, smile for me

I know it seems strange, this here way that we meetin'
But listen, I got hotel money, girlfriend, and I'm cheatin'
So if you come with me, I'll show you how I do
I got some mens up in here, you got some friends for my crew?
Or better yet, me and you could jet
And get butt nekk', end up soakin' wet
Swerve to Mary J., shorty, how that sound?
Spark the blunt then the lights are goin' down

Sometimes I still don't know why

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
Friday
I'm dreaming a mile a minute 'bout somebody
This feeling, I wanna go with it, 'cause there's no way
We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight
Can tell you want me
By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe
No shame in the game, just cut the shit, be honest
Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you've got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (Sensational, oh, yeah)

[Chorus: Britney Spears]
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
No rules
From the bar to the car, let's take it back to my room
Ignite in the heat of the moment, let the sparks fuse
Blowing up to the ceiling, we burning bright when we cut the light
'Cause you're the flame I can't do without
The fire comes in, the sky falls down
There's no way I'm gonna be fighting this tonight, this tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you've got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (Sensational, oh, yeah)

[Chorus: Britney Spears]
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

[Post-Chorus: Britney Spears & G-Eazy]
Baby, 'cause you're the spark that won't go out
My heart's on fire when you're around
Make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Yeah, yeah, Eazy

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
I don't care if it's a random person or the biggest star
Out in Vegas or a little bar
It’s really not a difference if it's near or far
Listen, here we are, need you
I've always wanted what was off limits
Staring at you 'til I'm caught in this
Back and forth like this is all tennis
I'm all jealous, you came with someone
But we can tell that there are changes coming
See, I can tell that you're a dangerous woman
That means you're speaking my language, come on
Now follow me, let's go (Go)
Like Penelope in Blow
Well aware that stealing you is a felony, yeah I know
That's why they keep on telling me to let go, yeah

[Bridge: G-Eazy]
But I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
To give you something sensational, so let's go, yeah
Said I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
So follow me and I can make you

[Chorus: Britney Spears & (G-Eazy)]
And make me oooh (Move), oooh, oooh (Yeah), oooh
And make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

[Post-Chorus: Britney Spears]
Baby, 'cause you're the spark that won't go out
My heart's on fire when you're around
Make me oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Yeah, you make me oooh

[Verse]
My braids rub my gut
Where my chain? Load my guns
Feel my cup, shoot shit up
Cop show up, show no none
Call your friends, once they sluts
All your friends, bust my nut
Love that bitch, she my crush
Don't trust-
I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you
We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?" Oh baby
Drunk in love we be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in that club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints for my body, so fluorescent under these lights, boy I'm drinking
Walking in my l'assemblage
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend, boy I'm drinking
Get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out, like washrags, he wet it up , boy I'm drinking
I'm singin' on the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway then riding with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood, grainin', grainin' on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that
Big body been servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good
We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?" Oh baby
Drunk in love we be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in that club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love (I'm nice right now, hold up)
That D'USSÉ is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talkin' about you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' about you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off on sight
Catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!" Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!" I'm nice!
For y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast, we goin' in
We be all night (we be all night) love, love
We be all night, love, love
I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing, that's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinkin', watermelon

Can't keep your eyes off my fatty, daddy, I want you
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 1: Beck]
Welcome to the land of the permanent sun
Where the flowers are melted and the future is fun
The freeway lizards are all feelin' so good
From a one-way trip back to West Hollywood, let's go

[Chorus: 2D & Beck]
Feels so good to have a perfect song
I feel so good to be in total control
I feel so good to have a perfect song
I feel so good to be in total control

[Verse 2: 2D]
There were spotlights flying, through the sky
From a winter wonderland, catching out
The beasts hiding in the clouds, no future, bad man
Nothing for Christmas, not very likely
One hundred million Viagra tablets
Stored in a warehouse... in a valley (laughs)

[Chorus: 2D & Beck]
Feels so good to have a perfect song (uh-huh)
I feel so good to be in total control (uh-huh)
Feels so good to have a perfect song (uh-huh)
I feel so good to be in total control (uh-huh)

[Bridge: Beck]
It's so convincing, but something's missing
The sun is kissing my face and erasing my doubts
I'm going out with a bang, and the fangs of a parasite
Are feeling alright
Alright all night alright alright alright

[Bridge: 2D]
Say sweet dreams, etc. & forever
I hope, said no one

[Verse 3: Beck]
She's a plastic Cleopatra on a throne of ice
She's a haemophiliac
With a dying battery life
Candy-colored fingers and schadenfreude eyes
Thinkin' airbrushed thoughts with a logo on her mind
It's so delightful, it's so insightful
It's so frightful, and I'm feeling it
Every single fucking day (yay yay yay yay yay)
It's time to party
It's time to party (whoo!)

[Outro: 2D & Beck]
In the valley where you wake up every beautiful day
And the world you created in your image is golden
Valley made of mirrors
Oh the night is so bright
You can feel like a pagan
You can feel like a pagan
In the valley (valley)
In the valley (valley)
In the valley (valley)
In the valley (valley)

Feel like a pagan now
Feel like a pagan

In the valley (valley)
In the valley (valley)

Feel like a pagan

[Intro: André 3000]
One, two
One, two, three, yeah!

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Inslumnational, underground
Thunder pounds when I stomp the ground (Woo)
Like a million elephants and silverback orangutans
You can't stop the train
Who want some? Don't come unprepared
I'll be there, but when I leave there
Better be a household name
Weatherman tellin' us it ain't gon' rain
So now we sittin' in a drop-top, soakin' wet
In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net
But this'll be the year that we won't forget
1-9-9-9, Anno Domini anything goes
Be what you wanna be as long as you know
Consequences are given for livin'
The fence is too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig, I might just touch hell—hot
Get a life now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell
Look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm & Hammer
Soul gold grill and a baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers
Stack of questions with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home, things are wrong
Well, not really, it was bad all along
Before you left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
Hello, ghetto, let your brain breathe
Believe there's always more, ah

[Chorus: André 3000 + Morris Brown College Gospel Choir]
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad
Yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad
Yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Uno, dos, tres, it's on
Did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone?
Like that there boy and will still stay street
Big things happen every time we meet
Like a track team, crack fiend dying to geek
OutKast bumpin' up and down the street
Slant back Cadillac, 'bout five niggas deep
75 MCs freestyling to the beat
'Cause we get crunk, stay drunk, at the club
Should've bought an ounce, but ya copped a dub
Should've held back, but ya threw the punch
Supposed to meet your girl but ya packed a lunch
No D to the U to the G for you
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo
Got a little baby girl four year, Jordan
Never turned my back on my kids, there for them
Should've hit it, quit it, rag top
Before you re-up, get a laptop
Make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coals
Record number four, but we on a roll
Hold up, slow up, stop, "Control"
Like Janet, Planet Stankonia's on ya
Moving like Floyd, comin' straight to Florida
Lock all your windows, then block the corridors
Pullin' off my belt 'cause a whipping's in order
Like a three-piece fish before I cut your daughter
Yo quiero Taco Bell, then I hit the border
Pity pat rappers trying to get to five
I'm a microphone fiend tryin' to stay alive
When you come to ATL, boy, you better not hide
'Cause the Dungeon Family gon' ride, high!

[Chorus: André 3000 + Morris Brown College Gospel Choir]
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad
Yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad
Yeah, don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad
Yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Sir Lucious gots gator belts and patty melts and Monte Carlos
And El Dorados; so I'm waking up out of my slumber feeling like Rollo
So follow, it's Showtime at the Apollo minus the Kiki Shеpards
What about a ho in a leopard-print? Ah
Teddy Pendеrgrass, cooler than Freddie Jackson
Sipping a milkshake in a snowstorm
Left her throat warm in the dorm room at the A.U
We blew hay too, athletes might cake you
But you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make 'cause

Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean

Canary yellow seven-nine Seville is on display
My nigga Bongo hooked it up, Omar gon' dip my rims today
So a nigga can ride out to the Honeycomb Hideout
I'ma show you how to wild out like Jack Tripper
Let me be bambino on your snipples
YKK on your zipper, lick you like a lizard when I'm slizzard
Or sober, six million ways to fold ya
Like Noah's, I get two's of youse and you get pretty 'D'
But I'll call yo' ass 'round eight-ish, I know you'll be there for me, girl

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & André 3000]

[Verse 3: André 3000]
Those huge baby eyes, get to runnin' off at they mouth
And tellin' me everything that's on your nasty mind
They say you're malnutritioned, in need of vitamin D
And invitin' me to that tingle in your spine
I love who you are, I love who you ain't — you're so Anne Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for 'bout two weeks
Rick James'n, no chains and whips
I do suck lips 'til hips jerk in double time
The boy next door's a freak, ha-ha!

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & André 3000]
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean

Everything is fine, you got your good things
And you've got mine
In Heaven, everything is fine
Yeah, alright
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I wonder if Heaven got space for me
I wonder if God got a big heart, and if so, if he got a place for me
Come on y'all, pray for me
Huh, hater stay away from me
Livin' in the fairy tale of make-believe
Makeup, silicone and Maybeline
Uh, two-tone, blue stones, toe peasants
They can only wish you death whеn you flex this
Tooth gold, two old Rolexes
Bluе eye, white guy on my necklace
White lies, blue notes so I'm precious
Bet they try to get to Heaven off leverage
Wonder if Heaven got a section for my ethnic
Nowadays, I say a prayer 'fore my next lick

[Chorus]
R-I-P, when I R-I-P
When I R-I-P
Wonder if Heaven got a place for a nigga like me
When I R-I-P

Hope Heaven got a place for a G

[Verse 2]
Might not make it up to Heaven, homie

Knockin' niggas out on camera, homie

Wildin' like I got the hammer on me
Even we ain't got the hammer,  homie
Where you goin', tell your grandma, homie
Better get it dawg, if you feelin' frog
Leapin', nigga leap, sleepin' with the dawgs
Sleepin' with the sheep, rest in peace to Mall
Might not make it up to Heaven, homie
Used to run around with hammers on me
Used to roll around with blickys with 'em
Actin' up and when the liquor hit 'em
Everybody out the jammer, homie
They was tryna put the slammers on me
I'ma talk in front the Sammy's, homie
Knockin' niggas out on camera, homie

From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stoppin' just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm fightin' the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinkin', "Why did I try?")
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stoppin' just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm fightin' the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinkin', "Why did I try?")

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
From the thread to the needle, middle-to-end
When skies cock back and shock that which couldn't defend
The rain then sends dripping an acidic question
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then, with the eyes tightly shut
Lookin' through the rust, and rot and dust
A spot of light floods the floor
Pours itself upon the world of pretend
Then the eyes ease open, and it's dark again

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Wakefield, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stoppin' just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm fightin' the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinkin', "Why did I try?")
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stoppin' just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm fightin' the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinkin', "Why did I try?")

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Movin' all around, screamin' of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
And as the wheels go 'round, the sunset creeps
Past the street lamps, cars, chain-links, and concrete
A window then grows and captures the eye
And cries out yellow light as it passes it by
A small, black figure sits in front of a box
Inside a box of rock with the needles on top
Nothin' stops in this land of the chain
When brains lose, not knowin' they were part of the game
And then, the insides grow, but the box stays the same
In shame, shovel up the pieces to the pain
You can try to hide yourself in the world of pretend
But when the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again

[Pre-Chorus: Mark Wakefield, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stoppin' just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm fightin' the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinkin', "Why did I try?")
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core of the rotten (Stoppin' just what I thought)
But sun has escaped us (So I'm fightin' the sky)
And I'm far from my weightless (Thinkin', "Why did I try?")

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda, Mark Wakefield, both]
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Tellin' me that I'm seein' right through you
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Tellin' me that I'm seein' right through you
Yeah, I got you caught in the act, you better step back
Tellin' me that I'm seein' right through you

Tellin' me that I'm seein' right through you

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

[Outro: Mark Wakefield]
In a minute, you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies keep piling up

[Verse 1]
Met him on a Saturday night, at Gracy's pool hall
He was talking all kind of crazy
So baby, can I call right before I gave him my number?
I pause for a second and make sure I had his attention
Looks him in eye and said

[Chorus]
Don't be that guy who always walks away
Too proud to ever change
Ain't gonna just sit down and listen
Don't be that kind who doesn't share his heart
I don't really care you who you are
You're not too cool to try
So don't be that guy

[Verse 2]
Every three minutes another heart is breaking
It seems lately that love is more about the taking
I know thats I've had my fair share of sleepless nights
And wondering why something I thought was good is gone

[Chorus]
Don't bе that guy who always walks away
Too proud to ever change
Ain't gonna just sit down and listеn
Don't be that kind who doesn't share his heart
I don't really care you who you are
You're not too cool to try
So don't be that guy

[Bridge]
I'd rather be lonely
Than be with thew wrong love

[Chorus]
So don't be that guy who always walks away
Too proud to ever change
Ain't gonna just sit down and listen
Don't be that kind who doesn't share his heart
I don't really care you who you are
You're not too cool to try
So don't be that guy

[Outro]
Don't be that guy

Soon as the beat knock in, I get offended, I get to makin' a face

Just got brand new keys (Vroom), uh, makin' my way on a Jake
Fuck boy talkin' that tough shit, talkin' that fuck shit that he won't say to my face
Put a lil' twist in the Fanta

Ain't no MC but she gon' get this hammer
She won't get nothin' from me, I ain't Santa

Took it right back like Shaq, I knew that coochie was slammin', uh
All red jacket like Thriller
Feelin' like uh, hit me (Oh)
All the jack boys can't stand 'em
Ask no questions, I ain't doin' no panеl

I just don't need to call out, I'm tag
I'm just calling up (Oh) so she can comе witness the check when I sign and say, "Ah"
I heard you payin' to fuck her
If I pull up, I promise she fuckin' for free
I'm finna fuck her then duck her, then send her back to you
'Cause niggas ain't fuckin' with me
I might just fuck her and dip
Uh, I got the stacks and they tucked to the tee
Shawty be touchin' on me
Ridin' and climbin', and suckin' and touchin' on D
I just got D and no love for a freak
She got a fee but I ain't payin' no fee
I come to fuck and she spray it on me
Bitch don't be playin' no games with me, woo

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Keep this shit a stack, get my money, make it swiftly (Swift)
Twenty thousand, thirty thousand fuck it, make it fifty (Make it fifty)
Niggas talkin' down, they just hate me 'cause I'm jiggy (Uh-uh)
Walk inside the club throwin' money, like a frisbee
Keep this shit a stack, get my money, make it swiftly (Swift)
Twenty thousand, thirty thousand fuck it, make it fifty (Make it fifty)
Niggas talkin' down, they just hate me 'cause I'm jiggy (Uh-uh)
Walk inside the club throwin' money, like a frisbee (Frisbee)

[Verse 2: VV$ Ken]

Baby keep suckin', she pullin' my venom

You know I'm packin', lil' hoe, I'm with it
Ten on fleek, too turnt up, I'm geeked
Poppin', ain't comin' out weak
I just been shoppin', ain't comin' out cheap
Blue hunnids droppin', they comin' out neat
Shawty a freak (Yeah), I watch her suck it, I peep
He better hide when I see

I know her pussy get wet when I motherfuckin' speak
Scammin' all week, runnin' shit, brand new cleats
Pretty bitch, brand new minks
New crib, brand new sinks
That hoe was ugly, I found me a brand new link

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
I'ma just bust in her face
Red bottoms, them don't come with no lace (Red bottom)
Kill the pussy, bitch I'm beatin' the case
Quarter milli', took it right out the safe
Soon as I pull out, the Lambo swervin' (Swervin')
Ten bitches stuff 'em in a Suburban
Fuckin' in her rib, I know that for certain
Bought the Rolls truck and then I added the curtains (Skrr)
I'ma buy brand new link (Link)
Dirty Sprite, I keep the cup on pink (On pink)
She was bad, she got a brand new mink (Mink)
My wrist on water like a brand new sink (Water, water, water, water)
Lamborghini on suicide

Chopper on me, know I'm keepin' the fire
Hunnid racks on me, why would I lie? (Rich)

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Keep this shit a stack, get my money, make it swiftly (Swift)

Niggas talkin' down, they just hate me 'cause I'm jiggy (Uh-uh)
Walk inside the club throwin' money, like a frisbee (Frisbee)
Late yesterday night
I saw a light shine from a window
And as I looked again
Your face came into sight

I couldn't walk on
Until you'd gone from your window
I had to make you mine
I knew you were the one

Oh, I would be glad
Just to have a love like that
Oh, I would be true
And I'd live my life for you

So meet me tonight
Just where the light shines from our window
And as I take your hand
Say that you'll be mine tonight

Oh, I would be so glad
Just to have a love like that
Oh, I would be true
And I'd give my life for you
So meet me tonight
Just where the light shines from our window
And as I take your hand
Say that you'll be mine tonight

Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two
And I'm done, I'm hanging up on you

I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for me, 'cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one day, but it'll be too late

Girls can wear jeans

But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading
'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading

Baby, tight blue jeans

Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it

[Verse 2: Madonna]
Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently, baby
Hands that rest on jutting hips, repenting
(Jutting hips, repenting)
Hurt that's not supposed to show
And tears that fall when no one knows
When you're trying hard to be your best
Could you be a little less?

[Verse 1]
My only problem is death
Fuck heaven, I ain't showing no religion respect
Brain damage, therapy's the only thing I regret
Talking to me is like a fucking body missing a neck
But, I'm surprised I ain't pop off my top off
Life is a bitch and my cock's soft, the Glock's cocked
My hands tremble, my finger slipped, the wall's red
Her life is fucked, she's sad now, her son is dead

[Hook]
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't evеr gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems
I told hеr I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your daydreams, that's how death seems

[Verse 2]
When I was younger, I would smile a lot
I'm getting older, getting bolder, but a wiser top
Now I'm drunk driving, lap's full of Budweiser tops
Life is a movie and you're just a prop
They begged me to stop, but I listen like deaf drums
Love? I don't get none, that's why I'm so hostile to the kids that get some
My father called me to tell me he loved me—
I'd have a better chance of getting Taylor Swift to fuck me
Annoying and I'm ugly, most niggas wanna punch me
I'm surprised the fucking doctor even touched me
Feel like Humpty, you hoping that I'll fall? Fuck y'all
I'm Ace, I'm parentless, odd, kinda arrogant
Ignorant as fuck, offend people for the hell of it
Because I am the devil, fucker, get on my level
Doughnuts and keys and kick-flips, Supremes and markers
My life is Ms. Mon-unique Parker, but a little darker
I'll see you in a couple, OF

[Hook]
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your daydreams, that's how death seems

[Interlude: Dr. TC]
Tyler, here's some water, man. You seem a little tense. How's Thebe?

[Verse 3]
All because a nigga just don't give a fuck
Parents wanna blame me all because their kid is fucking up
But fuck that, you're a shitty parent, face it, suck it up
That's what you should've did before that nigga bust, huh
Feel like I missed my little brother growing up
Feel like my little brother missed his brother growing up
But this is Golf Wang, like he missed his family growing up
I got a little taller since the last time you seen me, bruh
Now I'm emo, so fuck it, I'm pouring up
But I never had a drink— (Sydney, Tyler's throwing up!)
My nigga Jasper said if I drink and get drunk enough
I won't feel the feelings I be feeling when I'm sobered up
But that's a fucking lie, why would he say that? I'm
As emotionally straight as Travis when he--(Tyler, calm down)
Don't look at me, I'm 6'5", about to fucking cry
About another guy, but this is Golf Wang, do or die
I finally had a family
Domo's in another state, and where the fuck is Riley?
Now you niggas wanna be nice because the labels wanna sign me
But before the co-signing and you fuckers couldn't find me?
Fuck that! I hope you die in a fiery death
One ear I got kids screaming, "O.F. is the best"
The other ear I got Tron Cat, asking where the bullets and the bombs at
So I can kill these levels of stress, shit
They say that I'm shock value
How about you hop off cock and turn volume down?
I haven't got around to telling my mom shit (why?)
Cause I don't know how to...(whoa)
All I want is her support, but no, it's the fights at home
When mommy cusses out cousin, some knifes get shown
Now she's really fuckin' pissed, so the knives get thrown
And hit her in her fucking neck, now her throat's all gone
Looking like a fucking monster from the Twilight Zone
Then they wonder why I stay at Travis' pad with a backpack
For the whole week, full of plastic-wrapped black tees
And deodorant like his house is my home
I could live with the same hat
And the same flat-screen TV watching Flapjack
And the same bacon and waffles on a nice Saturday
Where I skate with the same fucking friends that
Didn't give a fuck about fame or a name, oh
"Message from The GZA, oh, another one from Plain Pat"
Email full of emails, I never write back
Ain't kill myself yet, and I already want my life back

[Hook]
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems

[Verse 4]
One shot, two shots, one gun, two cops
I'm going in flu shots, couldn't kill me with two top rockers
You're on the side of faggots and cock blockers
I'm on the side of bad-ass kids and the top notches
I'm Barney, dinosaur Harley of a human
Cause I'm shrooming with the bangers and the carneys
You niggas can't harm me cause y'all know that
We at the fuckin' Dirty like it's laundry (Tyler, calm down)
Nigga, get off me

[Outro]
(Calm down, man)
Fuck off me man, fuck (what's gotten into you?)
I don't know, it's like I'm a different person at times
Sometimes I'm fucking mad, sometimes I'm not (yeah, you...)
It's like I got a fucking voice in my head
Telling me to do all this fucked up shit, man (yeah, what's this?)
I don't fucking know, man (what's this person named then, Tyler, huh?)
He tells me to do this shit, that I don't wanna fucking do (what's his name?)
Tron Cat

[Verse 1]
Have you ever held the ease of a Sunday morning
Or the sunset of a golden afternoon
Has the beauty of the stars hit you without warning
Well that's the way I feel when I hold you

[Chorus]
Laying next to you is my favorite time and place
Ain't no way from breathing in each time you kiss my face
Drinking in this moment is all I wanna do
Baby, loving you is an easy thing
Baby, loving you is an easy thing

[Verse 2]
It's the edges of your eyes when you're smiling at me
And it's the way your skin can feel like summer rain
It's the way that you don't move or talk when I'm pouring out my hеart
Baby come over herе, touch me again. Yeah

[Chorus]
Laying next to you is my favorite time and place
Ain't no way from from breathing in each time you kiss my face
Drinking in this moment is all I wanna do
Baby, loving you is an easy thing
Baby, loving you is an easy thing

[Chorus]
Yeah, laying next to you is my favorite time and place
Ain't no way from from breathing in each time you kiss my face
Drinking in the moment is all I wanna do
Baby, loving you is an easy thing
Baby, loving you is an easy thing
Baby, loving you is an easy thing

[Outro]
Mhhh

[Verse 1]
You say you're sorry once again, dear
You want me to take you back once more
You say you need a helping hand, dear
But that's what you told me once before

[Chorus]
Walk softly on this heart of mine, love
Don't treat it mean and so unkind
Let it rest in peace and quiet, love
Walk softly on this heart of mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I know someday you'll find a new love
I'll feel your heart has turned to stone
But please, let me down real easy
'Cause loneliness moves in as you movе on

[Chorus]
Walk softly on this heart of mine, love
Don't trеat it mean and so unkind
Let it rest in peace and quiet, love
Walk softly on this heart of mine

[Outro]
Walk softly on this heart of mine
Walk softly on this heart of mine

[Chorus]
Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on the window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

[Verse 1]
When your lips are burning mine
And you take the time to tell me how you feel
When you listen to my words
And I know you've heard, I know it's real
Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
'Til I feel your

[Chorus]
Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on the window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

[Verse 2]
When you lookеd into my eyes
And you said goodbye could you see my tеars
When I turned the other way
Did you hear me say
I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky
You promised me when you said goodbye
That you'd return when the storm was done
And now I'll wait for the light, I'll wait for the sun
'Til I feel your

[Chorus]
Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on the window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain, wash away my sorrow
Take away my pain
Your love's coming down like rain

[Bridge]
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
And I say, never go away

[Spoken Interlude]
Waiting is the hardest thing
I tell myself that if I believe in you
In the dream of you
With all my heart and all my soul
That by sheer force of will	When I'm with you
I will raise you from the ground
And without a sound, you'll appear
And surrender to me, to love

[Verse 3]
Rain is what the thunder brings
For the first time I can hear my heart sing
Call me a fool but I know I'm not
I'm gonna stand out here on the mountain top
'Til I feel your

[Chorus]
Rain
I feel it
It's coming
Your love's coming down like
Rain, feel it on my finger tips
Hear it on the window pane
Your love's coming down like
Rain

[Outro]
I'll stand out on the mountain top
Until I hear you call
My name
Rain

[Intro]
Where is, where is, our love song?
Where is, where is, our love song?
Where is, where is, our love song?
Where is, where is, where is our love song?

[Verse 1]
Where is our song of love?
Where is our song of love?
Another love song between you and me
But a song of love for all humanity
Where is our love song?
Our desperately needed song of love

[Verse 2]
Where are our words with hope?
Oh how we need those words of hope
Not the kind of hope that leaves some of us behind
But the kind of hope that lifts up all humankind
Where are our hope words?
Our desperately needed words of hope

[Chorus]
Where is, where is, our love song?
Where is, where is, our love song?
Where is, where is, our love song?
Where is, where is, our love song?

[Bridge]
Guess the words we're singing
We’ll have to sing them forevermore, yeah
'Cause by our ways and actions
It's like you never heard them said before

[Harmonica Interlude + Harmonization]

[Verse 3]
Where is our prayer for peace
The prayer so long we yearn to release
Not just on this urban bloodstained street
But in every war-torn country
Where hate, pain, and killing feast
Where is our peace prayer?
Our desperately needed prayer for peace

[Chorus]
Where is, where is, our love song?
Where is, where is, our love song?
Where is, where is, our love song?
Where is, where is, our love song?

[Segue]
Not a love song between you and I
But a song that will test the universe to the Heaven’s eye
Where is our love song?
Our desperately needed song of love

[Outro]
Where is, where is, our love song? (Ohh)
Where is, where is, our love song? (In peace)
Where is, where is, our love song? (And me)
Where is, where is, our love song? (for them)
Where is, where is, our love song? (In our)
Where is, where is, our love song? (Do do do doo)

[Intro: Rapsody]
(It's the R-A-P-S-O-D-Y) Yo

[Verse 1: Rapsody & Cordae]
History say don't repeat her
Many years a slave, took notes from Lupita (Yeah)
You should marvel at the fightin' (Talk), feel like Anitta (Talk)
Apologize, you denied my people
Made our death legal (C'mon), we all paralegal (Uh)
Gotta defend ourselves when the laws ain't equal (Yeah)
Cops aim lethal (Baow), death in cathedrals (Uh)
Bang-bang boogie, you could die wearin' a hoodie, blaow (Yeah, uh)

[Verse 2: Cordae]
Alright, sometimes we gotta find our creator
If I defeated Father Time, was raised by Mother Nature
In the projects, tenement walls, sudden withdrawals
A true rebel is easy to spot the government flaws
Mass confusion, people in power commit collusion
Indoctrinated students, I'm the leader of the movement
Take lifetimes, tryna duck the school-to-prison pipeline
Disenfranchised, amazin' I'm in my right mind
Create change, survive, struggle to maintain
So many lies within the campaign, a damn shame
I'm thinkin' how will we survive
When the freedom that we have's a façade? Yeah

[Verse 3: Stevie Wonder]
You say you're sick and tired of us protesting
I say, "Not tired enough to make a change"
You say, "Just you hold on"
I say "No way, 'cause we can't put it in the hands of fate"
Can't put it in the hands of fate, now, baby, uh
You say that you believe that all lives matter
I say, I don't believe the fuck you do
You say, "All things in time"
I say, "That's why I'm not gonna put it in the hands of fate"

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Stevie Wonder]
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
Not gon' put it in the hands of fate now, baby
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
No, no, no, no
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
Can't put it in the hands of fate now, baby
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait

[Bridge: Stevie Wonder]
In the not so distant tomorrow
Robins will sing your lullaby
But I've seen too many of our generations
Live and die for that pie in the sky

[Verse 4: Stevie Wonder]
You say, "Those innocent lives should've not been taken"
And I say, "For them is why we take a knee"
You say, "Is that the right play?"
I say, "First Amendment everyday 'cause we can't put it in the hands of fate"

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Stevie Wonder]
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
Can't put it in the hands of fate now, baby
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
No, no, no, no
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
We can't put it in the hands of fate now, baby
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
Come on

[Bridge: Stevie Wonder]
In the not so distant tomorrow (Yeah)
Robins will sing your lullaby (Woah)
But I've seen too many of our generations
Live and die for that pie in the sky

[Verse 5: CHIKA & Stevie Wonder]
Yeah, we went from fields into a field
Bodies hittin' the ground, and so we gotta take a kneel
Mothers missin', kid's attorneys say they oughta take a deal
They determine that the price of life is just a couple mill'
And bricks are meant to build, and fire's meant to light
And souls are meant to rest and living soldiers gotta fight
We don't need no politics to try to justify the plight
It's a problem of the people, it's no longer black and white (Yeah)

[Verse 6: Busta Rhymes]
Look, said we ain't talkin' no more, we gettin' to it (Ha)
Can't put it in the hands of fate, this how we do it (Ha)
Now let me go and get with all of my people, you know I have to get
That'll show me sacrifice just like my brother Colin Kaepernick
Opportunities that I get to talk, you know I have to spit
Breonna Taylor turn in her grave, you know we have to get justice
And stay in your place, we still focused on the outcome of George Floyd case (Floyd case)
While you out here doin' the minimal (Ha)
Everything about us still live by the principle (Ha)
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait

[Verse 7: Stevie Wonder]
You say now you really truly get it
I say, "How much you do will let me know"
You say, "I'm so ready"
I say, "Let's do this, and not just put it in the hands of fate"

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes & Stevie Wonder]
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
Can't put it in the hands of fate now, baby
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
No, no, no, no
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
We can't put it in the hands of fate now, baby
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
No, no
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
No
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
No, no
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
No
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
No, no, no
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
Oh, no
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
Oh, no, no, no
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
Oh, no
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
Oh, no, no, no
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
A-no, no, no
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait
Can't put it in the hands of fate, ain't nobody got time to wait

[Verse 1]
You gave your heart
And you risked your soul
Now you can't get it back
But baby, love can win
I know love can win
You let go, and what she took
And now the pain take's up this life
But baby, love can win
I know love can win

[Chorus]
Oh baby
Let me show you how
Kiss away everything and how
Let me prove to you
When both hearts skip
No one has to lose

[Post-Chorus]
I know love can win
Baby, love can win

[Verse 2]
Wait, had you heard
We never see what steals from you
But baby, love can win
I know love can win
Don't pull back, will my touch help you
To break through
'Cause baby, love can win
I know love can win

[Chorus]
Oh baby
Let me show you how
Kiss away everything and how
Lеt me prove to you
When both hеarts skip
No one has to lose

[Bridge]
Baby, love can win
I know love can win

[Chorus]
Oh baby
Let me show you how
Kiss away everything and how
Let me prove to you
When both hearts skip
No one has to lose
Baby, I'll show you

[Outro]
Love can win
I know love can win

[Intro: T.I.]
88 Gang
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hitmaka
You know what the fuck goin' on, nigga (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
King in this bitch (Yeah)
Accept no substitution (Hol' up)
Ayy, YB help hype him up, bro (King, bitch)

[Chorus: T.I.]
I ain't never did shit small, all a nigga know is big ball (Uh, uh)
Fuck a nigga, get pissed off, they'll holla like a hit dog (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't nobody did it like this, don't nobody do it like King (Yeah, yeah)
The biggest my city done seen, anything else obscene (Shh, ahhh)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Boy you know a K.I.N.G., you a peon next to me
It'll be over 'fore you see, then he on the same thing I be on
Crankshaft body with your name up in neon, I'm turnt way beyond
Bentley full of bitches off of Ponce de Leon
Never thrown on the really, boy, you better chilly
'Fore I hit you in your left eye, I put that on Tionne (Phew)
All I done is all I know
Represent dope boys, kicked down doors
Most of y'all niggas wouldn't have a chance right now
If Rubber Band Man ain’t dominate in '04
Let me sell my blow and evade po-po
Now I'm doing big business, cash, no mortgage
Buy a big building, had foreclosures
Mo' money, mo' problems, boy, you ass sure told it (Sheesh)

[Chorus: T.I. & Tokyo Jetz]
I ain't never did shit small, all a nigga know is big ball (Uh, uh)
Fuck a nigga, get pissed off, they'll holla like a hit dog (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't nobody did it like this, don't nobody do it like King (Yeah, yeah)
The biggest my city done seen, anything else obscene (Ayy, ayy, shh, ahhh)

[Verse 2: Tokyo Jetz & T.I.]
Ayy, y'all ain't never did shit
Live that, with all due respect to the other side
Yeah you fuck niggas gettin' money
But they hoes, you can catch 'em with them other guys
Since a lil' bitch got respect
Hell nah, I ain't talkin' 'bout a lil' bit
Never fucked a nigga for a check
Come with too many problems, baby mamas, and the niggas come with lil' dick
Any bitch comin' after me, just a lil' bitch
Knockoff, big dog, never did shit small
Body goals, "Same ho talkin' in the group chat"
Worried 'bout my old shit, bitch, this a new rack
Ride through, top off, move wrong, knocked off
Two words, boss bitch, attitude, talk shit
New spot, renovate, pussy smell real fresh
Smile when I piss y'all off, couldn't thought a bitch fell off
I ain't ever did shit small, all a bitch know is big ball
Fuck a bitch, get pissed off, she gon' holla like a hit dog (Bark)
I ain't worried bout your hoes, don't nobody do it like tok (Hol' up, hol' up)
Rawest bitch out my city, can't another bitch fuck with me (Lil' bitch)

[Chorus: T.I.]
Huh, I came in the game, puttin' these bustas' in check
Got a problem with it? Good luck with that
Okay, I earned my stripes, I'm tried and true
If you hangin' with a opp nigga, then fuck you too
That's on the hood (Yeah)
Nigga, that's on the hood

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Okay, still get paid off rap, you see
Did my deal like Master P
Ayy, listen, all my gas be vacuum-sealed
Killin' this shit dead, no casualty
Okay, built my empire gradually
Used to keep white like ashy knees
And in comparison, you better do it carefully
Could still mention they name, just after me
Will never trade who I am to be whatever you are
We gon' get some understandin' before I go on your jaw
Ain't gotta have to know about you, already knowin' you flaw
You get in front of police and tell 'em whatever you saw
One thing about it, big wheel gon' keep on rollin'
Until the forward motion, regret, had when they bring out your bid
That when the pressure get applied, nigga, die for respect
Your ego big as a giant, you tryna keep 'em in check
Good luck with that

[Chorus: T.I.]
Huh, I came in the game, puttin' these bustas' in check
Got a problem with it? Good luck with that
Okay, I earned my stripes, I'm tried and true
If you hangin' with a opp nigga, then fuck you too
That's on the hood (Yeah)
Nigga, that's on the hood

[Verse 2: 42 Dugg]
Blogs change a nigga lyrics, guess I'm finally famous
Five hundred K in jewelry, bitch, I finally made it
Still swappin' out the twenties, right on 6th & Davison
Quarter million cash stashed, bro, them shit got raided
Still yellin', "Free my neighbors," enough for us to leave the nation
Fuck it up, we need to save it, back to hustle, I need the paper
Hit me up, you need a favor (What you mean?)
I can still get that truckload
Young Dugg been betrayed, it's hard to trust hoes
I might swap it out with TIP, go throw my buffs on
Lock in with the custo', top-ten for a month-long
Drop 'em for a run, but I still cop 'em with the backend
Ayy, we could nuke two hundred, I might need to grab tens

[Chorus: T.I. & Mozzy]
Huh, I came in the game, puttin' these bustas' in check
Got a problem with it? Good luck with that
Okay, I earned my stripes, I'm tried and true
If you hangin' with a opp nigga, then fuck you too
That's on the hood (Yeah)
Nigga, that's on the hood
Gang land, hell gang Mozzy
One on top, 

[Ocky?], nigga

[Verse 3: Mozzy]
Ayy, I don't fuck with suckers and niggas that do
My brother fuck with suckers, word to mother, he gettin' it too
Share your location when you postin', I'm sendin' 'em through
Talk about them corners, you be posted, we been in them too
Whoever ain't no child of these trenches is just a recruit
Blew them out the trap, niggas stupid, these bitches ain't bool
Hang with him, get hung with him, fuck niggas, no love for 'em
I just bought a new drum for him, I ain't bringin' up what I done for 'em
You ain't G enough to come plug somethin', nigga, shut up (Shut up)
I remain calm under pressure, when niggas was one up (On God)
We get to up on 'em, niggas up somethin' when you run up
Ayy, I got a phone call 'bout six-five and I hung up
Why do your name keep bein' brung up? Paperwork bein' dug up?
You ever told on one of your brothers, you niggas is suckers (You niggas is suckers)
Said, why do your name keep bein' brung up? Paperwork bein' dug up?
You ever told on one of your brothers, you niggas is suckers (You niggas is suckers)

[Chorus: T.I.]
Huh, I came in the game, puttin' these bustas' in check
Got a problem with it? Good luck with that
Okay, I earned my stripes, I'm tried and true
If you hangin' with a opp nigga, then fuck you too
That's on the hood

[Outro: Ms. Pat & T.I.]
Oh, shit, I used to sell dope and get money
You know I told you, nigga, shit, I mean my titty and blew my nipple off
(Yeah) Nigga, that's on the hood
You need two nipples to balance
Bitch, mind your business, my equilibrity is off

[Spoken Word: Rapsody]
Without TIP, the world just might tip
Might fall off axis
That's what you call balance
The ying, the yang, the twins, Gemini
They looking at the diamonds on you
Forgot you came out a cold world
Driving Taurus got you Ford
The trap like a cancer, crabs in the barrel, you still adored it
You was in your element
You know, heir to the throne
A lot of talk about your home, niggas think Tiny, you talk big
Lot of lying under fire, you did some shit
But ask a Sagittarius 'bout your archery
It's as straight as a straight shooter can get
Was raised by wolves, gotta keep the sheep from your kids
I see what the Pisces
Lot of crusty niggas wanna try P
Nigga, he tipped
Son of a gun, seen it, all of the clips
Looking in the eyes of justice and been a pupil of it
In his sixth house but he ain't a virgin to this
Done time and took time to cover the shit
Making sure the scales wasn't tipped in the wrong way for our people
Feel like he the GOAT in this bitch
Way beyond December to January-ish
He always gon' score POs, get off of the dick
We know you love your family, you welcome to fish
Go through hell for all of your kids
They your Aries, FGs, let her fly, let him be, hahaha
But no retrograde
So let's get back to the A
And why they call you the king of this shit

[Intro: T.I. & Logic]
What Juicy say? He be like
Shut the fuck up!
Yeah, yeah, hahaha
King

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I got immaculate vision, no cataracts in my pupils
Don't understand my decisions so I don't need your approval
I'm a motherfuckin' villain just like you see in the movie
But I'm still a motherfuckin' hero, stay lowkey like casino
In the weave of the cee-lo, pocket full of them C-notes
Backwood full of that primo, bad bitches drinkin' on Pino
And margarita, bikinis, in different cities you seen it
With bitches thick as Serena, lick it, yssup dna nisep
I see the line between a maniac and a genius
Fill up arenas, promoters, we take they ass to a cleanеrs
Two decades straight, a hundred shows, a hundrеd K at the gate
A night, a piece, capisce? Bread bigger than me (Sheesh)

[Chorus: Rahky & T.I.]
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Where real niggas move things on private planes
I said you lookin' for me, I be suckin', duckin' yo' lil' bitch ass
Lookin' for me, I be suckin', duckin' yo' lil' bitch ass
Ride through the city, hundred K on the seat
Shinnin' like bitches in bikinis, sunny day on the beach
Prey on the weak? Never, I'ma find a way to stay on my feet
Hand on my heat, Westside Atlanta, rubber bands on my bankroll

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Man, I been beefin' with my daughter, man, I'm dealin' with shit
And a lot of my niggas contemplatin', goin' killin' some shit
I put my bitch out like I'm Martin, in my feelings and shit
'Nother day of the dope boy, hunnid million legit, okay
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Where real niggas move things on a private plane
And you know I was trappin', workin' at an early age
Count my money, multiply, hurry, bag it up and buy it
Sixty-five with the iron, on the highway, blowin' big gas
Lookin' for me, I been suckin', duckin' yo' lil' bitch ass
Fuck up, I am handling my own motherfuckin' business
And drama, we ain't goin' back and forth 'bout the riff raff
Nigga talkin', nigga big cap, I won't listen to 'em
They get kidnapped back when nobody pay the ransom for 'em
Ain't never been a pawn, always been a king
And I ain't never gave a damn what a nigga think, fuck 'em

[Chorus: Rahky & T.I.]
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Where real, niggas move things on private planes
I said you lookin' for me, I be suckin', duckin' yo' lil' bitch ass
Lookin' for me, I be suckin', duckin' yo' lil' bitch ass
Ride through the city, hundred K on the seat
Shinnin' like bitches in bikinis, sunny day on the beach
Prey on the weak? Never, I'ma find a way to stay on my feet
Hand on my heat, Westside Atlanta, rubber bands on my bankroll

[Verse 1: T.I.]
You know what it is here, boy
Nigga disrepect, treat him like a real lil' boy
You tied my hand, I was left with no choice
Took me to a dark place that I still enjoy
Okay, shoutout to my nigga, kept it real in the war
Been through so much shit that you don't feel anymore
Numb to it, thumb through it, trouble, I'ma run to it
Shootouts every week, that shit was just fun to us
In my childhood, knew I was an entrepreneur
Took a hundred dollar bill, turned one into four
I learned wanna win big, gotta take big risks
'Member thirteen sayin', "I'ma run this shit"
Uh, started with a dream and a trap van
Look at what I fucked, God, I brung this shit
Uh, twenty years later, must say
I'm the coolest motherfucker that ever done this shit
Goddamn

[Chorus: London Jae]
Tryna fuck with real niggas

Anything left, make 'em wait, yeah (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Conway the Machine]
Fuck nigga, how could you hate?
These niggas be talkin', they watches is fake, look (Hah)
Rocket I got on my waist
It's real in these streets, you ain't got what it takes, yeah (You pussy, nigga)
I get a bag every week
By the end of the month, nigga, watch what I make, uh (Hahaha)
Watch what you say to me
Last nigga got outta pocket got rocked in the face (Boom, boom, boom, boom)
Yeah, I got my bands all in order
Five hundred P's, I can handle the order, uh
I work apparently smarter
This piece I got on sixty carats in water, woo
I put some ice on my bitch
And that Rollie was like thirty bands that I bought her
Jammed up my bro, got my man on recorder
While he in the Feds, I take care of his daughter
Machine

[Chorus: London Jae & T.I.]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Who you say would do it like this?
Bankhead, put it on the hood like this, uh
Dropped outta school in '96
Then hopped off in the game and matured like this, uh
Teacher said I wouldn't be shit
Hell, if I had listened to him then I wouldn't be TIP
You crossed that line, why wouldn't we trip?
Hollywood U-turn, nigga, when will you learn?
Payin' all the prices, ain't no nigga like this
Standin' in the fire, middle finger to the crisis
Believe the scales is offset, lil' nigga
You better get me, that a lost bet, lil' nigga
From shootouts on Westside to convos with insiders
Confront the one who make leaders and misguide us
Bitch slap the piss out 'em, won't take no shit out 'em
Hear me when I say, give a fuck about your feelings
Goddamn

[Chorus: London Jae]
Tryna fuck with real niggas
Commas in the safe, gotta do what it take, yeah (Yeah)
Forgi's on the Wraith, Balenciaga with the Bape
Yeah, I'm drippin' and they can't (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Sheesh, since I been gone, niggas all in my track
Gotta give me that back, yeah
Thinkin' I'm gon' take an L
Give it to me, I'll be givin' that back, yeah, yeah
Approach me aggressive
I bet ya times ten you be getting that back, hmm, hmm
Back like I left something, bih
Say my name, put some respect on that shit

[Verse 1]
Don't you misconstrue me 'cause I'm shootin' movies
Drop an album when I get the time to do it
Legendary and I'm still young
Still gettin' eight-figure deals done
Okay, yeah, I see you droppin' lil' songs
Bought some new chains and you feel strong
But the fact remain, lil' homie
Keep puttin' on, I'ma do you real wrong
Get your shit together, nigga, you know better
You a lightweight and I'm a sumo wrestler
Nigga cross that line, nigga, who gon' get ya?
And I ain't even gotta be in the room with ya
I been doin' this shit 'fore True Religion
Stackin' that money my new religion
Wait a minute, this year, you ain't in tune, is ya?
Nigga still ain't barkin' at the moon, is ya?
I'm still on the hill in my Lear out in Hampton
No disrespect tolerated, we relax that
Multimillionaire, eleventh grade, never pass that
Get it out the mud, know your worth, then you add tax

[Chorus]
Sheesh, since I been gone, niggas all in my track
Gotta give me that back, yeah
Thinkin' I'm gon' take an L
Give it to me, I'll be givin' that back, yeah, yeah
Approach me aggressive
I bet ya times ten you be giving that back, hmm, hmm
Back like I left something, bih
Say my name, put some respect on that shit

[Verse 2]
From the inner-city to the outskirt
Turned the white work into house work, yeah
Base, slab so solid, junkie bite it, make his mouth hurt
From the underworld to the upper-level
Rubbin' elbows, doin' deals with 'em (Who?)
The Arthur Blank's, Mark Cuban's of the world
Partner, you can't even deal with 'em
Manager be wantin' me to chill with him
All I do is keep it real with him
Found a way to designer plates
Preferably with two or three meals in it (Yeah)
My life a motherfuckin' movie
Somebody oughta be filmin' it (Sheesh)
And the industry went and tried to cross that bridge
I did with it, you know?
Jumped, twelve-years-old, off the porch, on the asphalt
Big risk, big reward, just avoid gettin' your ass caught
Re-up and flip 'til you rich for a lifetime
Then it's fuck whoever think of downtime
Ho, I'm back in this bih, gotta have mine, yeah

[Chorus]
Sheesh, since I been gone, niggas all in my track
Gotta give me that back, yeah
Thinkin' I'm gon' take an L
Give it to me, I'll be givin' that back, yeah, yeah
Approach me aggressive
I bet ya times ten you be giving that back, hmm, hmm
Back like I left something, bih
Say my name, put some respect on that shit

[Outro: Ms. Pat]
I gotta tell you, TIP
Your neck look like a old bitch pussy during the pandemic, haha
I said, "If this nigga don't cut that grandma pussy off his chin," hahahaha
I was like, "TIP neck look like my ass when I can't shave it"

[Intro]
If I had the magical powers to redo all the things most people have written
And if I had those powers, to bring you back here again

[Verse 1: Domani]
I'm runnin' in circles, lookin' and searchin', look high and low for the purpose
Convincin' myself this earth is just full of curses and cursive
I pull the curtains, interpretin' how I exposed the surface
Of niggas that no one's ever seen, they hide behind these magazines
Let's see, I seen it all way back
If I was you, I wouldn't say that, no
Anything they ever did to make sure I wouldn't еver win
It just made me a bеtter man, I put that on my soul
If it's platinum in my watch, should I still care 'bout goin' gold?
If I gave that shit away, you think I'm ever goin' broke?
I'm not chasin' money, money chasin' me
You found what you lookin' for when you stop lookin' for it, end of story

[Verse 2: T.I.]
See, more niggas want the glory and think success is euphoric
Expect to get rich tourin' and never do shit for it, man
I been historic so long, it's gettin' borin'
Multiple mansions to reside and switch foreigns
Pourin' plenty game in Domani cup
All our moves are calculatin', you could wish the dummies luck
Yeah I guess everyone exaggerates when they comin' up
But that just their imagination, really, these niggas ain't got no money, bruh
They wanna know who you are, not who you wanna be
Want smoke online and ain't handle around-the-corner beef
Coward, good luck avoidin' gettin' extorted with
Absentee morals and horrible priorities
Catch you somewhere in your mid-forties
Down in Florida, by the water, scrapin' up enough to buy a 40
Type of billboard ain't shit when you did poorly
Buy your kids so they can't remember what you did for 'em

[Verse 3: Domani]
Ayy, you remember when you showed me that half a mill' in that shoebox?
Then I said, "I want to rap," so you put me on Big and 2Pac
'Fore we came a long way, L.A. with B and Jay
Or flyin' to Coachella playing spades on PJ's
Gimme three days, my gallery finna triple my salary
Doubled up on my cake, doctors say I should watch my calories
Crazy, I couldn't fathom the thought of me goin' platinum
I shattered my ceiling and captured my feelings in this verse
I'll gradually kill 'em, I'll turn down a million, it's not worth my integrity
I'm most definitely my daddy's son, it's no denyin'
I used to run from my last name
I was mortified of being that nigga that live off a nigga at 25
So I moved out at eighteen and now I'm on my own
Pops, I know you got it, but I'd just rather get it on my own
Tell 'em stop askin' all them questions, the answers in my song
Place the pen in my left hand and watch me write my wrongs

[Verse 4: T.I.]
Ha, it funny ain't it, how I could be entertainin'?
Millions stashed in the bank and more millions on real estate
Ridin' round in a Vanquish, tryna stop for complainants
'Cause my kids won't let me help 'em and I just can't ascertain it
Then again, kinda remind me of me 'fore I met Jason
Sellin' crack daily but knew I was goin' places, listen
Sometimes you confident, can overwear your conscience and
To the point, seem like it make the smartest one do the dumbest shit
Learn to be the thermostat, not the thermometer
Never put your trust in niggas, even when they promise something
Okay, pride keep you hungry when you on the come up
Don't matter who you son of, nigga, you a one-of-one
Sometimes the weight feel like a hundred tons
I know, but learned to carry load, 'cause that the Harris way
Go win a hundred or nothin', don't never halfway
Fuck with anything and keep navigating your pathway
I already know it's greatness in you 'cause I put it there
They say that pressure make diamonds, find it
Be you at all times and see who not to align with
Nigga, shinin' was the point of the assignment, duh

[Verse 1: T.I.]
A message to pursuants who hate me 'cause I'm affluent
Boy, what the fuck you doing? You try me, you would be ruined
Animosity brewing from a distant, resentment
'Cause I've been the shit since 'fore you had a pot to piss in, yeah
So you think my decisions are unorthodox?
Then how you enter with no key when all the doors are locked?
Avoidin' cops, blowin' weed in a foreign car (Skrrt)
Think you goin' to war? It won't be goin' far
Call yourself goin' off, end up a tragic loss
Pay the ultimate cost for runnin' your mouth
Revert to Urban Legend TIP in a second, don't disrespеct it now
I got a problem wit' you, I'm in your presencе, impressive
Stepping (Step), wishin' peace and blessing to my opposition
Just know that disrespect is unforgiven (Fuck you)
You burn bridges, ain't no jumpin' fences (Nah)
That shit go left, it ain't no comprehension (Woo)
It ain't no question, gon' be consequences
King

[Chorus: T.I. & Jadakiss]
Forgive us 'cause we have sinned
Kings among peasants, and God amongst men
Say amen, make amends
You know, what go around come again, fuck nigga, come again
Forgive us 'cause we have sinned
Kings amongst peasants, and God among men
Say amen, make amends
Amen, let us pray, ha-heh!

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Just the thought alone make my body get the shivers
Forgive us for the bodies at the bottom of the rivers (Rivers)
'Cause when the devil call more than likely we delivered (Uh-huh)
So we deserve whatever it is that you wanna give us (Whatever)
Make it territorial, I make it your memorial (On sight)
One or two calls, they gon' kill like three or four of you (Yup)
We can go outside, but you ain't gotta brawl (Uh-uh)
Know what it is pussy, you used to niggas spalling you
Repercussions (Uh-huh), consequences (Yeah)
The Bible's a good read, a lot of contradictions (Yeah)
Find me some good weed, I'll be in the trenches
In front of the store nigga, or probably on the benches (Probably on the benches)
Champ here, so is the belt nigga
When the heat is on, I melt niggas
Don't say you feel me (Uh-uh), 'cause you don't even know how I felt nigga
And you can say your prayers if you think they'll help nigga
What's up?

[Chorus: T.I., Jadakiss & Benny The Butcher]
Forgive us 'cause we have sinned (Ha-heh!)
Kings among peasants, and God amongst men
Say amen, make amends
You know, what go around come again, fuck nigga, come again
Forgive us 'cause we have sinned (Ah)
Kings amongst peasants, and God among men
Say amen, make amends (Make amends, yeah, uh)

[Verse 3: Benny The Butcher]
Lord, cover my soul, I'm a sinner covered in gold
Buried some in the hole 'cause this money come and it goes
Caught cases for them street corners I left covered with snow
War wit' the government over shit that none of us own
I had an advantage, only when I'm packin' this cannon
It's nothin', 'cause I knew hustling come wit' collateral damage
Fuck it, kept it one hundred 'cause that's gon' add to your chances
Just make sure them niggas you rock with matchin' your standards, huh
My life a movie like Don Cheadle, hero'n needles
You only owe back loyalty if the squad feed you
Five ratchets in a small Regal (Small Regal)
Survive trappin', every cents, my finances been all legal (It's different)
Killers on my back, I was well-aware (What happened?)
So I loaded up that .50 then I said a prayer (Our Father)
I'm sittin' reminiscin' on my felon years
Trap nigga ran up six figures like a set of stairs
Let's go

[Chorus: T.I.]
Forgive us 'cause we have sinned
Kings among peasants, and God amongst men
Say amen, make amends
You know, what go around come again, fuck nigga, come again
Forgive us 'cause we have sinned
Kings amongst peasants, and God among men
Say amen, make amends

[Spoken Word: Ernestine Johnson]
I'm speaking, I'm speaking, okay?
Silent no more
The blood of our people arising from the shores
Ascending from the sand
Straight to our hands
Dripping from our fingertips
Yelling, kicking, screaming
And dreaming
See, they were here and know they're gone
And we didn't even have to say so long
Because they gave us the blueprint
Sat in, marched, slaughtered, and lynched for this shit
But we'd rather sit around, get money, clout chase, and gloat
Evеrybody got time, everybody want smokе
You can tweet and you can type, but did you motherfuckers vote?
I dare you to vote
I dare you to leave the trap
I dare you to learn more about your credit score
I dare you to know less about sports and own more houses and stores
Own some shit you could really call yours
'Cause, news flash, it ain't really your hood if you ain't own no doors
I dare you to rap about anything but your pussy
Or how good you suck his-
How good you look and how tight your Fashion Nova fit
I remember when rap queens really used to spit
Like really used to kick shit
Would look you dead in the face and ask you, "Who you calling a bitch?"
But now it's just so wet, how wet is it?
Is it as wet as our ancestors who were thrown overboat to drown, soaking wet?
Like sweat beads running down Harriet's neck?
Wet like immigrants swimming across borders until freedom?
Is it wet like Tamika Mallory's back as she marched down to Louisville, Kentucky for Breonna Taylor as she put her life on the front line?
Not knowing if it would be her last time
How wet is it?
'Cause Breonna Taylor was here
George Floyd was here
Ahmaud Arbery was here
Rayshard Brooks was here
Ronald Green was here
Elijah McClain was here
Jamarion Robinson was here
And now they're gone
And we didn't even get the chance to say so long

[Chorus: Alec Beretz]
Pantone Blue, when I'm with you
Off-White lies, black snake eyes
Tried so hard to make you a believer
To see you a little clearer
'Cause you and I were made to live through more

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Yeah, shoutout to the Most High, made a nigga so fly
Not a day goes by I ain't been that dude
You got that fire on me, let's get high
Wanted 3.5, I'ma bring back 2
I'm the exception, consider me the anomaly
No superstition, a superstar know astrology
I got a hunnid flows, for a hunnid beats
I want a hunnid mill', but did you want a million?
Kept a hunnid thеn, keep it a hunnid still
Get on your ass, I don't care nothing 'bout who you go and tell (So?)
I pray thеse haters never catch me like they Gargamel (Ha)
Nigga behind the wall, I pray they let ya outta there (Forreal)
'Specially you tell like they got you on a carousel (Forreal)
Tryna beat your self like you playin' solitaire (Damn)
When you needed help, they was never there
If you live or die, feel like they never cared
Meanwhile, I'm navigatin' smooth, movin' through the pandemic
God done made a believer out ya ass, now didn't He?
Nigga, mind your business, shut down your business
Shut down New York in a New York minute, listen
Until your ambition feedin' your fam, listen
Don't expect them to get your vision
When the shit bad live and you can't come through
Got the Rolls Royce truck and the Phantom too
Both Pantone, Blue

[Chorus: Alec Beretz & T.I.]
Pantone Blue, when I'm with you (Hahahaha, you dig?)
Off-White lies, black snake eyes
Tried so hard to make you a believer
To see you a little clearer
'Cause you and I were made to live through more

[Verse 2: T.I]
In the city, shiftin' gears in a six-speed
Bendin' corners, ask lil homie, "What the lick read?"
Muggin' hard, he say, "Nothin'," lookin' mischievous
Show it to 'em but don't let his smile mislead ya
Okay now, ain't nobody around, can't no one save ya
If we proceed with the procedure
Okay now, 12 come around, speak no evil
When they ask my old lady, she don't know neither
On social media, these people be talkin' shit, so unfortunate
If I ignored it, just could seem important, yeah
Knew who I was and never tried to be more than that
Scramblin' quarterback, ballin', boardin' jets
Start recoupin' before you even could go into debt
Nothin' but love to the ones, just show 'em respect
(All of my prayers to the ones that opposite that) Shit
When they openin' outside, it's just fascination
Me, I'm more worried 'bout the vaccination
Man, these people diabolical, they nothin' to play with
Put that shit in you or your baby, your ass crazy
But when the sun's out, and it's backlit
You sittin' poolside with a bad chick
When the shit bad live and you can't come through
Got the Rolls Royce truck and the Phantom too
Both Pantone, Blue

[Bridge: Alec Beretz]
Yeah, you and I were made for living
I only try to love you more
But I been caught up in my ocean
Sinking deeper than before
You shine light upon my shadow
You breathe pleasure into pain
You paint my world in Pantone Blue
So I no longer see in gray

[Chorus: Alec Beretz]
Pantone Blue, when I'm with you
Off-White lies, black snake eyes
Tried so hard to make you a believer
To see you a little clearer
'Cause you and I were made to live through more

[Intro: Tamika Mallory]
We are the mothers of civilization
We carry the entire nation on our backs
Our wounds have birthed America's greatest accomplishments
But be clear, our wrath will bring her to her knees
I am a black woman, and the black woman is queen

[Chorus]
Wind is high and stormy tonight
We can feel its magical light
As the sea comes speaking to me
Siren voices drift out of key
Wind and sea mix thoughts in my brain
As we feel its magical light
Wind and sea mix thoughts in my brain
As we feel its magical light

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Yeah, sittin' on the cement, readin' out the full agreement
Don't take shit personally, nigga, just see reflections of they own demons
Own buildings, don't need a loan neither (Nah)
Tryna measure my contributions, homie, you gon' need a long meter
My lyrics on a song with a strong beat
Give you my past just to tell a nigga his future like a palm reader (Damn)
Under palm trees blowin' weed with my feet up
Ain't never worried 'bout when nigga even mess a feat up
You shouldn't ever assume, knowledge is king so
Ask 'bout what you wanna know and say what you mean bro
Met with Farrakhan and asked him, "How in the hell
Do you love niggas more than they hate they self?"
When you can make it anywhere, but you did make it there
Stay in the same hood that kill you 'fore you get to really take it there
Know God perfect, they don't make it fair
I'm meditatin' to keep from gettin' stuck in my way 'cause it ain't safe in there

[Chorus]
(Wind and sea mix thoughts in my brain)
Keep from gettin' stuck in my way 'cause it ain't safe
(We can feel its magical light)
After a darker night come a brighter day, ayy
(Wind and sea mix thoughts in my brain)
Be cautious of shit that you get easy, right away, ayy
(We can feel its magical light)
They say after a darker night come a brighter day

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Yeah, nowadays I'm tryna stay up out the gossip column (I am)
Ignore opinions of people who can't even think to solve small problems (Stupid)
So what the fuck I look like yellin' loud?
Havin' a power struggle with motherfuckers who ain't even got no fuckin' power
It be, the same ones tryna empower
That'll kill you either way 'til you're dead before they give flowers (Damn)
I'd rather die today before I live in fear (Yeah)
And that go for any nigga on this hemisphere (Uh)
Young nigga in it, already winnin', huh? (Forreal?)
I be over here when you're twenty minutes up, yeah
How you gon' make it there burnin' bridges up?
Took too many lessons for granted, you shoulda listened (Boy)
Niggas hate on me out of ignorance, out of envy
Out of fucks to give ya, ho, fuck up out of my business
I got a vision, and a journey, and an attorney
Just in case, I use this burner to keep me off of the gurney, ah

[Chorus]
(Wind and sea mix thoughts in my brain)
Keep from gettin' stuck in my way 'cause it ain't safe enough
(We can feel its magical light)
Yeah, after a darker night come a bright day, ayy
(Wind and sea mix thoughts in my brain)
Be cautious of shit that you get easy, right away, ayy, be well
(We can feel its magical light)
They say after a darker night come a bright day

[Outro: Tamika Mallory]
My name is Tamika D. Mallory
And let me be the one to tell you: A revolution is in progress
I come in the tradition of Harriet Tubman, Ida B. Wells, Ella Baker, and Angela Davis
Mixed with a little bit of Jada Pinkett Smith and Cardi B
Because, you see, Black women aren't one-dimensional
We think different; we move different; we feel different ways about different things
We are not a monolith
But the one thing we all agree on is we deserve respect
And we demand respect
First, we demand respect from our Black kings, and then, we demand respect from the world
You see, Brianna Taylor was essential, and justice for her means justice for me

[Intro: Eric Bellinger]
David, David Banner
David—
Not the way I planned it
Oh, no, no (Oh)
If you could only know my feelings (Yeah)
Then you would know how much

[Verse 1: T.I., Eric Bellinger & Both]
Look (Hey)
Fuck all that protestin' and marchin' peacefully (Yeah)
They still gon' find a way to handle us egregiously (Oh)
Legally, if I may get this shit up off my mind now (Now)
We born in the battlefield, can't call no timeout (Yeah)
Every time now, it's another one of us lyin' out (Hey)
Cryin' out, “I can't breathe” until he dies out (Oh, no)
Make me at myself, what would you die about?
I doubt if a nigga been bangin' since junior high
Let ‘em fly, opposition resemblin' you and I (Sheesh)
Racist cracker, give a fuck about it (Givе a fuck about it)
They never will 'til thеy start pickin' up a couple bodies (Couple bodies)
When we got killed, well, there's some hours, scattered rain shower
The pain hurt (Oh) but the cold heart, fact of the matter, it's gettin' worse
(What else do you want? There's so much pain on me)
Damn, if I could wish upon a star
I'll send a special bullet everywhere you hateful bastards are
(What else do you want? Please don't hate on me)
Pull a string like a Gibson guitar, ‘way from afar
(What else do you want? There's so much pain on me)
Slow motion watch it enter your temple and exit your jaw, hmm
Send you all to Hell with a scar, a conversation piece
(What else do you want? Please don't hate on me)
Hope it maybe leads to a joke when you and Satan speak
Yeah, you patronizin' us, we waitin' patiently
Well, you'll prolly get your life to trade a day with me
Call that shit a eye for a eye, my nigga, by any means (Sheesh)
Had extended clips before skinny jeans (Yeah)
Now bow and arrows at cop cars with kerosene
That's how I'm feelin'

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger & T.I.]
How it feel for me (That's how I'm feelin')
To be all alone (That's how I'm feelin', shoot)
All alone (Fuck that shit, that's how I'm feelin')
How it feel for me (Ain't no guy to calm me down, how I'm feelin')
To be all alone (Shoot)
All alone (Now fuck that shit, that's how I'm feelin')
How it feel

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
I had a dream me and King saw Zimmerman (Zimmerman)
We laid low, masked up in a rental van (Rental van)
He killed a child, body was stiff and twisted, man
A mother cried, only one way to fix it, man
How long ‘fore the people in the street get tired of the evil, say “Fuck that”? (Fuck that)
How long will they kneel to heel of the state with a foot in the face 'fore they bust back? (Bust back)
Won't be long ‘fore agents of the state get ate like steak ‘cause the people too strong (Too strong)
Rapture's comin' one Sunday, it's blood by Monday, I promise I won't be long (It won't be long)
Lame nigga, same nigga, found out crackers had money on his head
Lame nigga, same nigga, callin' me like, “Michael, I'm scared”
I, hug that nigga like Michael did Fredo
Kept it G like my K tho
Excessive force, leave a nigga no choice but a nigga better shoot his shot, fatal (Fatal)
Bad boy, bad boy, tell me what you gon' do when the police kill your mama? (Your mama)
Fuck that, I follow Obama when he kill the crackers that killed Breonna (Breonna)
I take that charge, stick out my chest, confess to judge, "Your Honor" (Your Honor)
I'm the truth, my ancestors pray for your honor and fuck your mama

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger & T.I.]
How it feel for me (That's how I'm feelin')
To be all alone (That's how I'm feelin', shoot)
All alone (Fuck that shit, that's how I'm feelin')
How it feel for me (Ain't no guy to calm me down, how I'm feelin')
To be all alone (Shoot)
All alone
How it feel

[Verse 3: T.I.]
'Til the brawl finished, but we all been in
Niggas superhero, can you call in it?
In an' out problems, never solved any
But we got the work down to Albany
Keep a long order, it's a tall order
Murder after murder, people y'all killing's
Our aunts, uncles, our grandchildren
Can't ask for it, gotta take that shit

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
Ain't no repentance, eye for an eye, we want our vengeance
Life for a life, he kill your fiancée, kill his wife
Same for his father, generations of sons and daughters
It's hard to stomach, they say I sound like Ali Mohammed
I say you got me, we livin' under these fuckin' Nazis
What you expected? People riot, then you respect it?

[Verse 5: T.I.]
And a split decision, gotta pick a side with this division
But we ain't fit for livin', we can't protect our women and children
Man, we get sick, they just gon' give us some Clorox as Penicillin (Ha)
Experimentin' in Tuskegee, showed me you would deceive me (Forreal)

[Verse 6: Killer Mike, Eric Bellinger & Both]
As the city burned down and the night fall
'96 Impala, we just bouncin' like it's roundball
This ain't the ‘90s, and the youngings, I ain't scared, y'all
The water boys, they might shoot back at the red dawgs (Oh)
I tell ‘em plot plans, strategize, organize (Yeah)
Immobilize a secret army and stay unified

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger & T.I.]
How it feel for me (How I feel, how I feel, how I feel, how I feel)
(That's how I'm feelin')
To be all alone
(That's how I'm feelin', all alone, shoot)
All alone, yeah
(Fuck that shit, that's how I'm feelin')
How it feel for me
(Ain't no guy to calm me down, how I'm feelin')
(How I feel, how I feel, how I feel, how I feel)
To be all alone (Shoot)
(How I feel, how I feel, how I feel, how I feel)
All alone
(Now fuck that shit, that's how I'm feelin')
How it feel for me  (How I feel, how I feel, how I feel, how I feel)
(I mean the truth is)
To be all alone
(I'm a human, you a human, skin color aside, riddle me this)
All alone, yeah (How dare I speak peace to a maniac?)
How it feel for me  (How I feel, how I feel, how I feel, how I feel)
(The fuck does that make me? I mean, you motherfuckers can bend your knees man)
To be all alone (How I feel, how I feel, how I feel, how I feel)
(Fold your hands and your Bibles and pray as much as you motherfuckin' want but)
All alone

[Outro: T.I.]
The art of not fightin' back was brought to us by Christianity
That was given to us by our oppressor
So you continue to follow that, you continue to follow them
I be goddamned
I tell you what, nigga, you see me down bad, motherfucker on my ass
Nigga, don't fail me, nigga, help me, nigga
I'm tellin' you that, nigga, while I'm right here, nigga
Nigga, I'd do the same for you
No cap, nigga
That bullshit ain't 'bout nothin'

[Intro: T.I.]
(Hitmaka)
Yeah
Came a long way to make it here
Gotta thank God that I made it here

[Chorus: T.I.]
Have a good time, the hard times show up
Money comin' fast, hope it never slow up
I done came a long way to make it here
Gotta thank God that I made it here
Respected by every hood, nigga, throw up
Stood solid, never let niggas ho us
I done came a long way to make it here
Gotta thank God that I made it here

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Show your credentials, who you akin to? (That's it)
Boy, who you done beat up? What you done been through? (Uh-huh)
Hit you on your records, you soundin' very high (Uh-huh)
But what you done did the nigga can verify (Uh)
No corroboration, ain't no conversation
Just a bunch of a cap mixed with a lot of hatin'
Went from hand to hand at the serving station
To makin' a hundred-and-fifty grand just off day trainin'
And man, we know you ain't did the shit you said there
Where I come from, you end up a dead man
Playin' 'round, where a nigga die for stayin' down
The neighborhood we can't build it faster than they tear it down
Black man fire, and homie, I hear sirens
White police firin', homie, and they silent
Then they expect me not to be violent, it's a lose-lose
Tryna unlearn what I been taught since elementary school, damn

[Chorus: T.I.]
Have a good time, the hard times show up
Money comin' fast, hope it never slow up
I done came a long way to make it here
Gotta thank God that I made it here
Respected by every hood, nigga, throw up
Stood solid, never let niggas ho us
I done came a long way to make it here
Gotta thank God that I made it here

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Might've took a minute but we got it in (21)
Lost a couple M's, lost a couple friends (On God)
Gotta take some losses if you wanna win
Disrespect, it's damn near mandatory that we gotta spend (Brrt)
Tryna hibernate, we give his next-of-kin (21)
Encore, fuck it, hit they block again (On God)
I embrace the struggle 'cause I understand
Fell in love with hard times, they turned me to a fuckin' man (21)
Livin' by the code, I don't talk to police (Never)
Stand up when I'm pissin', can't no nigga ho me (Pussy)
Rapping like I'm preachin', all my bars holy
You flexin' for the 'Gram, that is not your Rollie (21)
Pockets overweight and all my opps bony (Facts)
Sucker shit or hater shit, I'm not condonin' (Never)
See it in your eyes, all your love phony (21)
Stabbed me in my back and then he tried to bro me (21)

[Chorus: T.I.]
Have a good time, the hard times show up
Money comin' fast, hope it never slow up
I done came a long way to make it here
Gotta thank God that I made it here
Respected by every hood, nigga, throw up
Stood solid, never let niggas ho us
I done came a long way to make it here
Gotta thank God that I made it here

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Research information , reach, scratch beneath the surface (I am)
I'm bendin' knees, searchin' for my life's purpose (Amen)
Think you can pray your way up out of misfortune? (No)
You're mistaken and most churches is extortion
What the Bible say 'bout faith without work? Huh (Damn)
You can still do everything right and get murked, huh
Think to support education they ain't learn (Uh-huh)
Still hate, got 'em killin' and they turnt (Go)
Seen so many futures and families set on the mantle (Like who?)
Like Bankroll Fresh and the king of Alabama
Doe B, Peanut Da Don and Lil Chink
Dex Osama, Camouflage back in the day
Then there was Dolla, Lil Snupe, triple X, and Mac Dre
Man, every day a blessin', learned that shit from hustle
Don't take that shit for granted, do yourself some damage
In a mansion with expensive granite, tryna understand it

[Chorus: T.I.]
Have a good time, the hard times show up
Money comin' fast, hope it never slow up
I done came a long way to make it here
Gotta thank God that I made it here
Respected by every hood, nigga, throw up
Stood solid, never let niggas ho us
I done came a long way to make it here
Gotta thank God that I made it here

[Outro: Ms. Pat]
I did the prayer 'fore Ciara ever did that prayer
I said, "Lord, send me a nigga that don't hit me in the eye on Friday, and got a job, and can read"
And I got one
I met my husband
And he wasn't gon' let me, he wasn't gon' let me fuckin' sell dope
And at the time I was a check forger for the rest of the league got on the check forgin' game
And he was just a Christian nigga, he wanted everything to go right
Fucked around and, I fell in love with him and got a job at McDonald's, 

[?] Road for four dollars and twenty-seven cents an hour
I'm like, "Who the fuck do this shit?"
This is whacker than a motherfucker
"Is this what Jesus told you niggas to do, to work for four dollars and twenty-five cents an hour and y'all ain't stealin' shit?"
So you know me, I started stealin' from McDonald's, nigga
As I ring you up, I rung you out
Fuck y'all laughing at?

[Spoken Word: Deyjah Harris]
We are all diamonds in the light reflecting in our own special way
Something strong in our spirits attack those who feel as though it's filled with everything they have yet to reach
In reality, it has nothing to do with us
Because when we truly love ourselves, we can see the truth
The blacker the berry, the louder the spirit
Black lives have mattered before the saying even existed
The color of our skin, the texture of our hair and our unique features
Why die to fit in, when we were born to stand out?
The light we possess will forever outshine any darkness thrown our way
When you have the courage to be yourself and share the gifts that you were been blessed with, you give others the art of knowing that they can too
Be a reflection of what it is that you desire
Your soul is beneath no one and your soul is superior to no one Your greatness awaits to walk with you in your destined path
I bet you were expecting to hear something different
Probably hoping I'd serve you some tea more specific to business of ours
But I'm just too gifted to be here on that bullshit you see
Evolution is key, and stagnation ain't me
Nah, I'd rather admire the beauties of life finding solace in places it'll take most more time to acknowledge

You're only looking for attention
You only notice it 'cause I'm never around

You only notice it 'cause I'm never around
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Boy, we wasn't never no joke, nah, nah, nah
All summer, murder he wrote, nah, nah, nah
Who they talkin' 'bout? Nah, nah, nah
Doin' everythin' they didn't allow, nah, nah
Overthrow, send the drones in
All the maneuvers, feelin' closed in
I don't need to strike back, I let God fight my battles
Ain't strapped with a TEC, laid it down, now where they at?

[Verse 1]
Next time you text, can it wait?
You are talkin' to a presidential candidate
I know you think Obi-Wan gettin' tired now
Don't jump, Anakin, I got the higher ground
I'ma hit the moonwalk like I seen Tito
Man... like the Prеsident just got vetoed (Woo)
Got to sign off for thе veto, ayy
I don't need to sign a release, I'm a freed old man
This is a video game, this is a simulation, man
How do you listen to lame? They the imitation, man
Take an idea, live it, take a idea, did it
Take an idea with it, just look how we get it
Just look how we did it, can't tell me we ain't did it
Can't tell me we ain't lived it, can't tell me we ain't lived it
Just look how we get it, cartoons ain't timeless
Cop cars ain't mind us, one call ain't wireless

[Chorus]
Boy, we wasn't never no joke, nah, nah, nah
All summer, murder he wrote, nah, nah, nah
Who they talkin' 'bout? Nah, nah, nah
Doin' everythin' they didn't allow, nah, nah
Overthrow, send the drones in
All the maneuvers, feelin' closed in
I don't need to strike back, I let God fight my battles
Ain't strapped with a TEC, laid it down, now where they at?

[Bridge]
If I put myself in harm's way to get my own masters
They'll put theyself in harm's way to stay the master
They'll put theyself in harm's way 'cause they ain't askin'
They'll put theyself in harm's way, the slaves are massive

[Verse 2]
Do you want me to get specific?
Do you want me to name numbers?
Do you want me to name summers?
All the stars came from us
All the styles came from us
All the talent came from us
All the shoes came from us
But the news ain't on us
All the news ain't honest
All the news ain't honest
They wanna ignore me, rewrite the story
Take all the top spots, in every category
Back in fashion with them boys, can't ig-can't ignore me

[Chorus]
Boy, we wasn't never no joke, nah, nah, nah
All summer, murder he wrote, nah, nah, nah
Who they talkin' 'bout? Nah, nah, nah
Doin' everythin' they didn't allow, nah, nah
Overthrow, send the drones in
All the maneuvers, feelin' closed in
I don't need to strike back, I let God fight my battles
Ain't strapped with a TEC, laid it down, now where they at?

I fuck hoes like Eazy-E, I got the curve without the AIDS (Without the A)
It's the way that I was raised, you break the rules, I gotta spill (Gotta show you)
Tool's the ten commandments, we add one, eleven, do 'em in (Blrrd)
I know your ho wanna fuck because she see these Cuban links (I know she see this ice)
When I stuff your throat with dick, you better look at me, don't blink (Bitch, you better not blink)
Nigga, when you hear about it, don't come ask me, ask your ho (Ask your ho)
Bitch, it's Gutta Gang and I get gutta, you know I bang fours (You know we throwin' fours)
When it come to gettin' money, they know that I get aggressive
Think about dissin' me, think again, boy, might as well get the stretcher (Blrrd)

[Verse]
I fly to Dubai so much, I need a camel or somethin' (Wow)
So fly I might need me a camera (Ching)
Pour out my heart, talk shop with the mammals (Skrrt)
Shitted on the parking lot, might need a Pamper or somethin'
Hands on my dick like a ransom or somethin' (Mwah)
Countin' up money romantic to her (Racks)
Think I might purchase her panties or somethin'
Her man is a bum and she still in the slums (Slums)
All these guns like the Navy or somethin'
People lookin' at me like I'm crazy or somethin' (Crazy)
Plus all this ice on my arm
When you come where I'm from, a nigga gotta stay with a gun (Pow)
Stackin' up M's like I'm savin' for somethin' (Stackin')
Hitters tote guns and don't tote 'еm for fun
Pay a lil' somethin' just to play in her gums (Racks)
Drop a few crumbs and I sprayеd on her tongue
Upper echelon, in a three-seat coupe (Uh)
This a concept one-of-one, I still got two (Woo)
Ridin' down Peachtree in a three-piece suit (Woo)
And I'm 'bout to write my name on the cement too (Gucci)
Gucci Billy Bathgate, scandalous as Watergate
Heard that the street dry, tryna make the dam break (Water)
Open up a new trap, doublin' my fan base
Whippin' up shake, I done made it a pancake (Whip it)
Diamonds so big, I don't even want a handshake (Clean)
Grew up so broke, when we finished the mayonnaise (Damn)
Cleaned out the jar, made a glass for the Kool-Aid
Mom went to work, made it skrrt with a two-way
Unc' in the du-rag, he parkin' the dually
He ain't even have to rip me up to do it
Think I'm the coach 'cause I'm pointin', they shootin'
Stay out my business, find somethin' safe to do (Bow)
We ball like we hoopin', we robbin', we lootin'
We braggin', we boastin', we causin' commotion (Go)
My niggas got motion, it's potent, we smokin'
Pollutin' the bales and you know I'ma move it
He ain't even have to rip me up to do it (No)
Tag on his toe and they filled him with fluid
Pull up in a Buick, my lawyer, he Jewish
Sell weed like I grew it, I grew here, you flew here
Can tell that you new here, shoot guns like it's New Year's
Yeah, we went to school with you, I never knew you
Recruited a shooter, he don't pray to Buddah (Yeah)
TEC with a coolant, get smoked like a hookah
Jump off the jet with a big ol' bazooka

Two mil' for the Richard, replacin' the Muller

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
(12-09, 12-09, 12-09)
(30, you a motherfuckin' fool, nigga)
Huh?
Go

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
These bitch ass niggas act like they be on their period or somethin'
I don't play with niggas, period, get hit with the drum
Ain't no mystery, my heart black like Black History Month
I show no sympathy, I'll have them people searchin' for months
Cut off his legs, chopper hit it and it knocked off his knees
Cut off his head, cut it off, then bring that shit back to me
Cut off his dreads, heard they did it in the middle of the street
I made him famous, R.I.P., I put that boy on TV
11 Alive, Fox 5, Channel 2, BET
Why would Gucci pay you when he could do it for free?
I'm too rich for broke bitches, I ain't fuckin' for free
I don't need these borin' bitches, mane, these hoes need me
Born in Bessemer, Alabama, the worst place in the world
For a Black family to raise a lil' boy and girl
If you ain't talkin' 'bout money, then quit talkin' to me
Cash rules everything around 1017 (Gucci)

[Chorus: Quentin Miller]
Okay, huh, yeah, been through it all
I gotta go hard, win, lose or draw
I cannot get caught up in the pen, years and thoughts
I cannot get throwed off, I just got to go off
Trips to the dealership, trips to the vault, uh
Checks in the mail, make it flip, summersault, uh
I gotta stay locked in, I cannot get throwed off, okay, okay

[Verse 2: Quentin Miller]
1017, it's a scary thing
13-17, take over everything
Now you hold weight beyond measuring
White chalk, tape, we murder every scene
Came from the trench, not the trap, though
Real music left, we brought it back, though
Gotta put the streets on our back more
Gotta put the city on the map more
QM and Guwop on attack mode
Ride on you niggas like a RAV4
Niggas talkin' down from the back, though
Tell 'em, "Take a picture, it'll last long"

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I'm not no blue collar criminal, so I don't do subliminal (No)
I drop a check and board the jet, on to another M and M (Go)
I ain't got no spare time, I ain't on that square time (Huh?)
My Richard Millie a milli', really don't use it to tell time (Well damn)
My young hitters sharp, but treat big niggas like they small fries
MAC-11 with the chicken nuts and they super-sized
Guwop got a rare mind, people call him Einstein (Gucci)
I make money in my spare time, but I don't got no spare dimes (Guwop)

[Chorus: Quentin Miller]
Huh, yeah, been through it all
I gotta go hard, win, lose or draw
I cannot get caught up in the pen, years and thoughts
I cannot get throwed off, I just got to go off
Trips to the dealership, trips to the vault, uh
Checks in the mail, make it flip, summersault, uh
I gotta stay locked in, I cannot get throwed off, okay

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Big ol' motor in my rear, and it gon' get me 'way from here (Nyoom)
Don't pull up on me, partner, I'ma get to switchin' gears (Don't pull up on me, holmes)
This gun for huntin' deers, this AK came with a spear (Grraw)
This Glock, it came from Smyrna, it's plastic, not stainless steel (Woah)
You be hatin', but I can't hear it, first you boo it, then you cheer it (Damn)
I can't take you serious, your kind, I can't even stand near it (No)
You niggas on your period, I just bought some new Amiris (Amiris)
Million after million, they think Gucci racketeerin' (Wow)
New Phantom, I'm the driver, I fucked up my power steerin' (Go)
Sixties, they so big, it make my shit sit like a chariot (Well, damn)
I just bust a watch and that bitch got so many karats (Brr)
When they talkin' big money, the only time I'm wearin' it (Whoo)
Niggas be crabs with their money, Gucci Mane don't cherish it (Racks)
But if I rocked jewelry they rock then that would be embarassin' (Huh?)
Lames get a lil' bit of money, don't know how to handle it (Lame)
I don't need help with this money, it's under good management (Gucci)

[Verse 2: Veeze & Gucci Mane]
I'm 'bout to stop rappin', I got more money than your manager (Well, damn)
Broke bitch said we fucked, it was in her dream, she just imagined it (Woah)
Nigga ride down this block, he gon' get more shots, he gon' think I'm a cameraman (Grraw)
Nigga, come to my spot, you gonna see a lot of chops, look like Afghanistan (Huh?)
I'm in the coupe with Lil' Meechie, tip my cup 'cause the nigga keep stabbin' it (Lil' Meechie)
I'm 'bout to steal Wock' 'rari and stab in that bitch without readin' the manual (Skrrt)
I thought he was runnin' it up, but I passed him up, he ran out of stamina (Go)
I know all my niggas is crazy, they ever go broke, they gon' act like some animals (Grrr)
I smoked a whole zip of Exotik, my eyes real low, look like Linsanity (Ah-hem)
He caught a domestic violence, he mad at his bitch just because she a fan of me (Lame)
His lil' ho keep beggin' to fuck, by the time that I hit it she couldn't even handle it (Ho)
I'm really a snake, when I get on a plane, in my mind I be thinkin' 'bout Samuel (Slatt)
I really don't see shit but money, ain't nothin' but dollar signs all on my calendar (Racks)
These niggas sneak dissin', I hear it, I still ain't kill 'em, I just ain't get mad enough (Woah)
I pulled on the scene, I was smellin' like weed, with a cup that was darker than Africa (Huh?)
Before I could ever be cuffin' a thot, you would catch me swimmin' in Canada (Huhh)
I tried to change
Closed my mouth more
Tried to be soft, prettier
Less... awake
Fasted for 60 days
Wore white
Abstained from mirrors
Abstained from sex
Slowly did not speak another word
And that time my hair I grew past my ankles
I slept on a mat on the floor
I swallowed a sword
I levitated
Into the basement
Confessed my sins
And was baptized in a river
Got on my knees and said, "Amen"
And said, "I mean"
I whipped my own back
And asked for dominion at your feet
I threw myself into a volcano
I drank the blood and drank the wine
I sat alone in begged and bent at the waist for God
I crossed myself in thought
I saw the devil
I grew thickened skin on my feet
I bathed in bleach
And plugged my menses with the pages from the holy book
But still inside me coiled deep was the need to know
Are you cheating?
Are you cheating on me?

[Chorus]
Gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Twenty of them wrapped up tight in silk
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill

[Verse 1]
Jimmy pulls up in his blue Chevy Nova
I have been dying for him to come over
I'm in my party dress, he said "You're such a mess"
I am the New Jersey dance queen
He is a gangster action king
He knows that I be selling the body
My man the best 'causе he knows what's up

[Pre-Chorus]
He knows it's a big bad world (Ah)
Knows that I'm a good girl (Ah-ah)
He undеrstands the sale of self
'Cause cash come quick when looks can kill

[Chorus]
And there's nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Got twenty of 'em wrapped up tight in silk
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Mmm-mmm-mmm

[Verse 2]
J is a romantic roller coaster
He don't do anything he's supposed to
I like 'em tough and mean
Jim is the worst that I've ever seen
I am the trailer park darling
He is the one-time comeback king
He knows that I be waiting to die
He says "Babygirl, beware of the high"

[Chorus]
And there's nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Got twenty of 'em wrapped up tight in silk
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill

[Bridge]
I love your ultraviolent swing, I love your ultraviolence
I like it when you treat me mean
Say "You're stupid but you're gorgeous"
I need you, Jimmy
I need you, Jim
You're stupid but you're beautiful
I trust you but looks can kill
Looks

[Chorus]
And there's nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Got twenty of 'em wrapped up tight in silk
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill

[Outro]
Ruby Tuesdays or Mobil
I love you then, I love you still
Ruby Tuesdays or Mobil
I love you then and I always will
I love your ultraviolence, I love your ultraviolence
I love your ultraviolence, yeah
I need you, Jimmy
I need you, Jimmy
I love your ultraviolent ways

[Verse 1]
I know a place with neon palm trees, so
We can get a late call to the show
Heavy hitter, hey, heavy hitter, heavy hitter
J’adore, j’adore

[Verse 2]
I heard a man screaming, “lights, camera, action”
I c-c-can’t  re-mem-mem-member what happened
I overdosed, you throw me over your shoulder
I was dying, you were screaming

[Chorus]
Open up your, open up your
Open up your butterfly doors, mm
Open up your butterfly doors, heavy hitter
Open up your butterfly doors, of your speed green Lamborghini
J’adore, j’adore

[Verse 3]
Miss national grand supreme
Miss tropical USA
It’s high glitz for the US queen

[Bridge]
Let’s ch-ch-change our DNA
Let’s change our DNA, heavy hitter
Let’s change our DNA, come all the way
Let’s change our DNA, are you with me?
I know a way to get away

[Chorus]
Open up your
Open up your butterfly doors, heavy hitter
Open up your butterfly doors, heavy hitter
Open up your butterfly doors

[Verse]
Methamphetamines, I met my man
Drag queen at heart, just like I am
Puts on his wig, eyelashes, bam
King Coney Island
One diamond, the guide lights on
The record spins blue '50s song
The veranda looks ocean now
Neon palms sway
What’s happening? Where did we go?
The Jersey Shore was long ago
As with our hopes and ocean grove
And so I bid you farewell
A sunset drive
With your plastic bags
Full of videotapes
The angels in the love
They tell me where to go
I think wind is coming down

I hope you know I'm fine
I hope you know you tried

I cried and talked
Haven't slept in so long
Makes me feel like some mime
Why can't I sleep?
So afraid of what I'll dream
Nothing there to hold it down

I hope you know I'm fine
I hope you know your guide
I hope you know I'm fine
I hope you know you're mine

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Rollin' on dubs (Ooh), rollin’—, rollin' on dubs (Ooh)

Rollin'—, rollin’—, rollin' on dubs (You are about to witness)
Rollin'—, rollin'—, rollin' on dubs, rollin' on dubs (Chyeah)
Rollin'—, rollin' on dubs

[Verse 1: Bill the Kid]
Yeah
On dreams, every time I come up with a scheme on scene
With the green on lean, seems so mean
Hoes comin' out the freak bitch, you were watchin' TV
I'm just here for my team, ho
Got a mazy on my 1950 beam
So they know me as the artist with a linе of vintage T's on
Weed smoke, peacе, ho, throw does, speakin' numbers
Just for weak kids to go home, we don't know you
I roll whole foods and blow black owl smoke, I'm on the pound now
You prolly think there was a clown, no
East side to Cali though, don't get it twisted
'Cause we here loads downtown, ribbons on a zipper hood
Crispy old stitchin' vintage, pretty old hippy shit
Rather not shop and just go what I'm meant to get
For now I'm in the Burgh gettin' figures but California dreams, not so far distance here
I can't lie, I'd like to earn the black instead of stripes
Flippin' big birds on the curb, I can't turn to that
I'm in it still, where the air feels great, and I can never complain
I got a fam and we make ends
Make friends, know it's blood or fuck off the dicks
All kicks, not laugh, just all the pics
Red shit you can't have, so I'm here with Mac
Treejay's on the track while he roll his pack
And I'll never let their backs off
Used to hit Mac off with packs just to get him cash, dawg
Now we're past grown, with antique fabrics on
They got me in this booth to spit some lines that hit like Magic on 'em

[Interlude: Franchise & Mac Miller]
Aight (Franchise)

[Verse 2: Franchise]
Gucci, Gucci, Louie, Louie, Fendi, Fendi, Prada
Ain't show up in none of that, but she finna give up that slobba
Just a THC fit and some based out Vans
From the east side of Pittsburgh to Studio City, we jam
You can bang it at your man's or bang it out your sedan
Steam a Q of piff too, and if its dro, well, we burn a gram
Peanut got some purple, and Treejay just copped a O of hash
We stop smokin' bullshit in '05, let that potent pass
Really ripped, pass me a couple of that activist, I'm really hit
Kickstand status on this flight, snorin' off some silly shit
But since I'm on the west, I'm actin' brand new, it's damn true
Might have one of Mac's Hollywood honeys, h'just what Fran do
Hit up Demi Lovato, let her hold his dick for a day
Me and Sofia Vergara, a pair up while I'm out this way
No stuntin', no frontin', we coast to coast, man
You ain't gettin' a VIP unless you Most Dope, fam

{Verse 3: Willy Whip$}
My man Billy kinda silly with the zips of the piff
If he hand you one off, better give it a wiff
Get full off another forty, a bitch
The way we ballin' out, you would think that we rich
Oh, I see you already know how the Most Dope roll
Off a Henny and the O
If we blowin' on somethin', best believe it ain't that dro
Bitch, suck my dick while I smoke this blunt, I'm gangster

[Interlude: Mac Miller]
Vinny Radio

[Verse 4: Vinny Radio]
Wanna be part of the team, first compliment the genes
This they need noggin mornin' sausage for the team (Bitch)
The drop portions, hit the compartment for the greens
Doin' donuts inside the apartment of your dreams (Skrrt)
So turn around, bitch, make that Tootsie Pop, pop
Block like a volcano, we be pushin' rocks, hot (Woo)
How you pullin' no hoes, and you push a drop-top
As your older sister been be gettin' pussy since Osh Kosh?
When I'm hoppin' out the coupe with the pipe and the palm
Lick my lips, raise my eyebrows, blow a kiss to your moms
Ask her, listen, my line up been consistent with charm
But those rich bitches ain't got no tricks to get a nigga this bomb
So I'm hoppin' off the red-eye, hittin' up your wifey
Hoppin' in the brown eye, gotta get my hair fluffed
Appointment around five, Vin gettin' money
Conquerin' the world on my downtime, I'm so about mine

[Interlude: Mac Miller & Peanut]
Rollin' on dubs (Yeah, motherfucker)
Rollin'—, rollin' on dubs (Yeah, yeah, that's it; you already know)
Rollin'—, rollin'—, rollin' on dubs (Aight; rollin' on motherfuckin' dubs)

[Verse 5: Peanut]
K fouled off, stupid, and yo' bitch a groupie (Ooh)
And she only wanna fuck me when I do it
Then she got blowed and rolled up a dub (Dub)
Then I played that weak Madden for a dub (Dub)
Give me, uh, some of that Oregon ducky
Then you just came through, then wanna fuck me
Then you brought that AP through, just dutch me
Then I got some nor for the fifty
I don't break it down, I roll it up in pods
It's Most Dope and strange against all odds
Now niggas need pods
My bitch light skin like John Stock
Tippy tat on the tippy tae
Now your girl wanna call me Pootie Tang
And you only smokin' on that pooty face
And you only see me with the pretty Kate
And I need a wet pussy like a 

[?]
I'ma save a ho with this tazor cape
And then I'ma roll strange all day
Fresh as fuck, nigga, I'm like a '90s case
Off tees, homies, Most Dope and up
Don't break it down, just roll it all up in pods
Don't break it down, just roll it all up in pods

[Interlude: Mac Miller & G-Reg]
Yeah
Ayo, what's up, G-Reg?
My man G-Reg right here (Yo, this

Yeah, what up, playa? ('Bout to tear this thing up)
Go ahead, homie (You ready for me?)
Yeah (Let go)
Let go (Bro)

[Verse 6: G-Reg]
First name G-Reg, don't make me have to smack ya
Red cup wit' me drinkin' liquor, throwin' stacks up
Mac like Tracy when he played for the Raptors
Step outta line, I might slap ya
You want a verse? That's fifty grand
Pullin' chicks every time I do the titty dance
I really am, you just act tough
When I bench, I put a rack up

[Interlude: Mac Miller]
Ayo, Dave
I think it's about time you address these people
What's goin' on, homie?

[Verse 7: Big Homie]
I ain't playin' no games, you can miss me with that bullshit
Jump the barricade and get dragged into the bull pit
LittleDave the Twitter, BigDave the baes
That's about the Most Dope boys gettin' all the change (Cash)
Mass respect or my fist make sure your teeth work
Stomp your face off, Albert Haynesworth, let em squeeze ho (automatic)
We be crackin' crabs down by the time y'all catchin up
Reclinin' in the tally at the spot with my feet up

[Verse 8: Q]
I'm eatin' Roscos, chicken and waffles (Number nine, off top)
Go get a job, ho, make me some tacos
Carne Asada, shrimp with the lobster
Ima pimp with the posture, get bitches like posha
Put some piff in the Palmer, I'm rippin' the bong up
She liftin' her thong up, I'm twistin' the strong up
Master kush, OG, OG (Yes)
Bakin' cookies, real cookies, homie (Chocolate chip)
Mom's recipe, shout out to Kim
And Mac brought the weed, so shout out to him (That's my homie)

[Interlude: Mac Miller]
Aight, I'm about to rap
I'm a real—I'm—I'm a—I'm an MC, you feel me?
To the M, the O, the S, the T (I'm a real MC)
The D, the O, the P, the E (You know what I'm sayin'? I really take this shit seriously)
I don't fuck around at all
When I spit out these bars, I spit 'em from the heart (Yeah)
I spit 'em hard
Let's get it started (Look)

[Verse 9: Mac Miller]
Back in the day I was Mac with a packet of haze, rap in elaborate ways
Bitch get smacked in the face, more ass you can smash, more hash, more cash in the bank (Damn)
Azalea or Ashley, pussy juice dri-dri-dri-drip on my khakis, I kicks it with Iraqis
Piss in a baggie, then I sell it as gold (Take that)
Go to ya kingdom and I'll melt down the throne (Make that)
Stuck on this dope, yeah-yup, I'm the goat, greatest of all time
Watch this beat get fucked in the throat, choke
Most Dope, marvelous, arduous
I'm the hardest with arsenals of these artists
I'm startin' a revolution, shit
Bitch got a booty thick, coochie loose
Tuna fish groupies want a movie kiss
But they just get there uterus torn to shreds (Torn to shreds)
Make a billion 'fore I'm dead (Yeah)
Hors d'oeuvres gettin' served to me while I'm in bed (Kill 'em)

I drive drunk to see fear, my dick says, "Come eat here"
Your cooch says, "Come skeet here," I love pussy, I need that
Your bitch is my weed sack, I always break it down
Had a threesome with a minor and a chubby chick
Fuck it, though, they love my dick, rubbin' it and huggin' it
I one time fucked a bitch 'n' had her squirtin' like a porno flick
But little did I know, it wasn't cum, it was a bunch of piss

My feet were killing me
My dogs were barkin'
I must have fallen asleep
Where I was parkin'

And then I dreamed two dogs were talkin'
Take my word
It was the doggone-est thing
You ever heard

She said (Mama will bark) You look so lovely in the moonlight
(Yes, but Papa will bark) Your eyes are shining like the starlight
(Yes, but Mama will bark) Your lips are so inviting, darling
Give me one more kiss

(Mama will spank) The night is young and you are here so near
(But Papa will spank) Please let me whisper in your ear, my dear
(But Mama will spank) This is the moment I have dreamed of, darling
Oh, what a bliss

I think that I shall never see
A tree as lovely as thee
Hot dog, woof
(Take me right home) I wish tonight would never end
(I know that Papa will spank) I'd like to be more than a friend
(I know but Mama will bark) You know I'm crazy 'bout you, honey
Give me one more kiss

Give me a kiss (I really have to go, Ma will worry)
Give me a kiss (It's getting late. I really have to hurry)
Hah, hah, hah (Well, just a teensie weensie little one
And then goodnight)

Give me a paw (That thing inside me says I really shouldn't)
Let me hold your paw (If it was anybody else, I wouldn't)
Give me a paw (The way you make me stay out late with you)
(It just ain't right)

I swear that I shall never see
A canine lovely as thee
Hot dog, woof

(Take me right home) I wish the night would never end
(I know but papa will spank) I'd like to be more than a friend
(I know but Mama will bark) You know I'm crazy about you, honey
Give me one more kiss

Oh, so you're the one out there that keeps me daughter out at night, hah?
Well, take that! Yelp. And take that. Yelp. And take that. Yelp
Yelp, yelp, yelp, yelp, yelp, yelp
Hot dog, woof

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Huh
Guwop, brr, brr
Once again I'm locked in with TP, we finna make a hit (Go)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Walker Homes, Herndon Homes, hell, you can be from Bowen Homes
If you ain't bustin' fire, holmes, I'm tradin' yo' ass like Jerry Jones
Gone on and run along, run by myself, I come alone
Drop my nuts, I'll use my own, you borrow nuts, you took a loan
I'll be playin' naive but I know 'xactly what's goin' on
Chopsticks like I'm Chinese, I might dynamite a hater home
Judge lookin' down on me like he a king sittin' on the throne
Murder charge, I beat the case then beat my chest, I'm King Kong
Lavish home, gettin' super dome, head knocked me out like Larry Holmes
Money long, don't saw the barrel off, I like the barrel long
Gucci gone, you rats ain't really have no one to tattle on
Try me, nigga, Memphis killa, snake your watch and ride along
Pest control, we killin' rodents, that's what Gucci really on
Coronavirus got me itchin', clutchin', all these masks is on
Niggas think it's cool to be broke, that shit ain't in fashion, holmes
Ain't no hit and run, you can't insure it, I see you, we crashin', holmes

[Verse 2: BIG30]
I'm from Mill Branch, but I got killers out of Cleaborn Homes
Play pussy, one to the dome, now you gotta create a stone
By myself with a few bales, ain't no stoppin' for jakes or law
Hood hero servin' cold, how he make it with eighty boulders?
My lil' brother, think he pop? Smooth dude and he keep the Glock
In the field with gloves on, swingin' steel, we play for the Sox
High-speed chase, we duckin' cops, I just got off on 70 North
Choppa Gang, So Icy Gang, me and Shiesty got matchin' watches
He a rat, I'll draw some cheese, try to eat, put his ass to sleep
No Draco, big .223, roll up and smoke his ass like weed
My niggas, they CGE, he ain't gang, he ain't shit to me
Two-hundred shots up in his SUV, shots out the AUG

[Verse 3: Pooh Shiesty]
That shit wasn't no dream when I had slammed that man out in my sleep
And I did some shit I can't rap about, but may they rest in peace
Strapped up in this Phantom, ran though Bouldercrest, but from the Creek
Just young niggas from D.A.G. tryna leave bodies in the street
It's different type of smoke, if I gotta slide, bodies got to drop
Lil' slimy dude gon' stay on top, grab the Draco and shake the block
FN in my trench coat, I post by the door like Jamie Foxx
We got him and his cousin shot, give a fuck if they know or not
This brand-new Glock came out the box, my chop came with a forty, stock
MGU ran in my spot, took all my shit and broke the lock
I'm back at it again, I know them crackers wanna see me fall
I kept callin' my lawyer, he wouldn't answer, that shit had me hot, brr, brr (Brr)

[Verse 1]
I've been out on that open road
You can be my full-time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
You can be my full-time baby, hot or cold

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't break me down (Me down, me down)
I've been traveling too long (Too long, too long)
I've been trying too hard
With one pretty song (Hmm-hmm)

[Chorus]
I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just drive, just drive
Just drive, just drive

[Verse 2]
Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life an art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it
Light 'til dark

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't leave me now (Me now, me now)
Don't say goodbye (Goodbye, goodbye)
Don't turn around
Leave me high and dry (Hmm-hmm)

[Chorus]
I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
I just drive, just drive
Just drive, just drive

[Bridge]
You think I'll ever feel different than I do now?
You think I’ll ever feel any magic again
You think I'll ever transform into the man
God meant to make when he began?

[Chorus]
Hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
I just drive, just drive
Just drive, just drive

[Intro]
(Woah)

[Verse 1: Dave Bayley]
As cold as an old ice cream sandwich
As focused as Mr. Miyagi
You poke at your phone, posting aerial photos
Of you and your smoothie
I can't keep on making you happy
'Cause you got issues with your daddy
I miss ramen noodles and laughing at you
And your gran in home movies

[Refrain: Dave Bayley]
But I wish I could show you more of yourself (Woah)
I wish I could make you somebody else
But I left it way too late
Are you stuck in your own ways?
I'm begging

[Chorus: Dave Bayley]
Hands, knees, please, tangerine, come on back to me
Got what I need, tangerine, do this for me
Hands, knees, please, tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need, tangerine

[Verse 2: Arlo Parks]
I wanna see you bloomin' like a tulip
With your hair dyed peach
I'm readin' through your letters (Woah)
I remember when you saw through me
And now within your pale blue eyes
There's nothin' I can keep
I used to know the way you smiled
And how you liked your tea
Now, you're spirited away
Catch a glint in the eye of the ghost that you are
It'll never be okay
You're a star of the past
Gonna miss that sweet little tangerine

[Break]
(Oh my God)
(Drop the beat)

[Verse 3: Dave Bayley]
You've been dreamlessly sleepin' for years
Super clear since the late 1990s
You only look at me properly now
When you're drunk, watching movies
Where are you? What happened? I want what we had
Where you gone? Where you hidin'?
It's 2:23, you got Friends on repeat
On repeat, on repeat, on repeat, on repeat, on re—

[Refrain: Dave Bayley]
I wish I could show you more of yourself
I wish I could make you somebody else
But I left it way too late
Are you stuck in your own ways?
I'm begging

[Bridge: Dave Bayley]
Hands, knees, please, tangerine, come on back to me
Got what I need, tangerine, do this for me
Hands, knees, please, tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need, tangerine
Hands, knees, please, tangerine, come on back to me
Got what I need, tangerine, do this for me
Hands, knees, please, tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need, tangerine
I'm beggin'

[Chorus: Dave Bayley]
Hands, knees, please, tangerine, come on back to me
Got what I need, tangerine, do this for me
Hands, knees, please, tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need, tangerine (Woah)
He is a hustler, he's no good at all
He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum
He lies, he bluffs, he's unreliable
He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun
I know you told me I should stay away
I know you said he's just a dog astray
He is a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart
But mama I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside I just can't deny, I love the guy
He is a villain by the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun
That man's a snitch and unpredictable
He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none
All I know, should've let go, but no
'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart
But mama I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside I just can't deny, I love that guy
And he's got my name
Tattooed on his arm his lucky charm
So I guess it's okay he's with me
And I hear people talk
Trying to make remarks keep us apart
But I don't even hear
I don't care
'Cause mama I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside I just can't deny, I love the guy
Mama I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside I just can't deny, I love the guy
I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
'Cause I'm capable of anything
Of anything and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, a perfеct storm
'Cause once you're minе, once you're mine
There's no going back
Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away, don't walk away
It's in the palm of your hand now baby
It's a yes or no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it up to me
Up to me, give it up to me
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, a perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back
She's a beast
I call her Karma
She eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer
Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart was on steroids
'Cause her love was so strong
You may fall in love
When you meet her
If you get the chance you better keep her
She swears by it but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I'm gon' put her in a coma
Woo! Damn I think I love her
Shawty so bad
I'm sprung and I don't care
She got me like a roller coaster
Turn the bedroom into a fair
Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil' mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know whatcha falling for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm coming atcha like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, a perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 1]
Felt your heart stop beating, tracked your phone
Good to share when you feel alone
Got at least one month and your friends always say
Your money's always melting through your pocket anyway
Saw the post about a thing tonight
Black shirt on and it fits just right
You're like a candle burning at both ends
This place ain't perfect but you don't wanna burn it down

[Chorus]
You know better
You know better

[Verse 2]

[?] the light looked strange
This song's about how it always restrains what you go
Forgot to talk in the part where I said your name
You want something to smoke, it'll get you out ahead

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You know better
You know better
You know better

[Verse 3]
You got a cistern knowing it's too much
Bombay and you fill your cup
If it's sinking, you could use a night
Coming here thinking maybe you're lying down
Pull out your phone 

[?] room's too bright
Black sheets on, that don't look right
You leave a candle burning by your head
Fall asleep thinking 'bout all the nights we've ever had

[Chorus]
You know better
You know better
You know better

[Verse 1]
I trust my spirit, only my spirit can truly see
I follow my guide, I take the bridges it shows to me
I walk with presence, I seek connection to everything

[Chorus]
Spreading 3 Degrees
I want to fall, I need a lift
Give me 

[?]

[Verse 2]
I trust my visions, I know decisions I've made before
I take my journey, I feel the purpose it trains me for
I walk with presence, I seek connection to everything

[Chorus]
Spreading 3 Degrees
I want to fall, I need a lift
Give me 

[?]

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Spreading 3 Degrees
I want to fall, I need a lift
Give me 

[?]

[Verse 1]
Oh, yeah
I just pretend, uh, that I'm in the dark
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss
I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you

[Pre-Chorus]
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I don't ever wanna know
I can tell what you done, yeah
When I look at you

[Chorus]
In your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to
Oh, you try to
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes
You lie, but I don't let it define you
Oh, define you

[Verse 2]
I tried to find love
In someone else too many times
But I hope you know I mean it (Mean it)
When I tell you you're the one that was on my mind, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I would never let you know (Let you know)
I'm ashamed of what I've done, yeah
When I look at you

[Chorus]
In your eyes (Your eyes)
I see there's something burning inside you (Inside you)
Oh, inside you (Oh, inside you)
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to (But you try to)
Oh, you try to (You try to)
You always try to hide the pain (Oh, oh)
You always know just what to say (Oh, dear)
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes
You lie, but I don't let it define you (Hey)
Oh, define you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
In your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes
You lie, but I don't let it define you
Oh, define you

[Verse 1]
I can feel it caving in
Like it was my fault,  it wasn't
I can feel it sinking in
Like I've no two legs below me

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna do right by you
But what do I do?

[Chorus]
I'll give you all that I am
As long as you'll take it there
I'll give you all that I can
As long as you'll wait for me there

[Verse 2]
I can hardly silence it
It was the darkest dive to die for
Then a dream just came to me
Nothing more to lose, it's knocking on my door

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna do right by you
But what do I do?

[Chorus]
I'll give you all that I am
As long as you'll take it there
I'll give you all that I can
As long as you'll wait for me there

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
I don't know what to do

[Chorus]
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

[Verse 2]
Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone
The lights are on, but there's no one home
Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two
And I'm done, I'm hanging up on you

[Bridge]
I can't keep on waiting for you
I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for me, 'cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one day, but it'll be too late

[Chorus]
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
(Okay)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington]
Peel back the lid to the dotted line
Fill the cup to the inside line
Close the lid
Let it stand for three minutes
Remove the lid, stir well
And enjoy! (Ready?)

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington]
Caution:
Product is hot
Please
Handle with care
Caution:
Product is hot
Please
Handle with care

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's a nuclear winter outside
Everybody's gone
And died
But I'm a lucky fellar
Long as I've got you in my bomb cellar
The radiation's gettin' to me
Your blonde noodle hair is all I see

[Chorus: Chester Bennington}
Ooooooooh
Cup o' Noodles
I only have 26 of you left
I'm one noodle closer to death

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You're sour and sweet
And you stick to my teeth
And you’re shearing the flesh
From right off my mouth beef
By mouth beef I mean tongue
It's a weird thing I sung
But I couldn't think of a good rhyme

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda]
Oh Sour Patch Kids
You assault my mouth hole
It’s a full fledged attack
On my teeth's enamel
Due to oral bleeding
My gums are receding
Oh boy!
What a wonderful time!

[Intro]
I'm hung up
I'm hung up
I'm hung up

[Chorus]
I'm hung up
Waiting for your call
I'm hung up
I'm hung up
I'm hung up

[Verse 1]
Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up, I don't know what to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
I don't know what to do

[Chorus]
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
I'm tired of waiting on you

[Verse 2]
Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone
The lights are on, but there's no one home
Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two
And I'm done, I'm hanging up on you

[Pre-Chorus]
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goеs by so slowly
I don't know what to do

[Chorus]
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tirеd of waiting on you
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

[Outro]
I'm hung up
I'm hung up
I'm hung up
I'm hung up
I'm hung up

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
When I took a bite
Thought it would just be for tonight
Can't get enough
Wish my insides were more tough
My fingers are stained by your touch
My heart is stained twice as much
Your love is a flame should have known by your name

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Flamin' Hot Cheetos
(All right buddy, you ready?)
(Come on in)
(Hit it)
(Yeah, give me the low end)
(I'm bringing it)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
If there's Sour Patch Kids and Cabbage Patch Kids
Where are all the other kinds of patch kids?
I'm talkin': Pumpkin Patch Kids
Eye Patch Kids
Nicotine Patch Kids
Girl Scout Patch Kids
Patch-ouli Kids
Blue Jean Patch Kids
Letterman Jacket Patch Kids
Computer Software Patch Kids

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
We're all one batch, the world is our patch
Sing with me now!
We're all one batch, the world is our patch
So lets get together and end global warming

[Mike Shinoda]
(Uh)
(Yeah, turn it up)
(Hot)
(Yeah)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Chester Cheetah reppin' Cheetos
70 miles an hour he goes
Tail like a rudder, tough as a mudder
Can't milk him, he got no udder

[Pre-Chorus 1: Mike Shinoda]
This song is fast
Cheetahs are fast
This song is hot
Cheetos are hot

[Chorus 1: Mike Shinoda]
Cheetos, Cheetahs
Cheetos, Cheetahs
Cheetos, Cheetahs

[Pre-Chorus 2: Mike Shinoda]
I like both a lot
This song is fast
Cheetahs are fast
This song is hot
Cheetos are hot

[Chorus 2: Mike Shinoda]
Cheetos, Cheetahs

[Chorus: Nikki Lane]
Breakin' up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, but it's makin' me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely, but it's the right thing

[Verse 1: Nikki Lane]
Are these my good years or do I have none?
Are there really good years for everyone?
I don't wanna live with a life of regret
I don't wanna end up like Tammy Wynette

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Nikki Lane]
'Cause breakin' up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, but it's makin' me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to bе lonely, but it's the right thing to do

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
Georgе got arrested out on the lawn
We might be breakin' up after this song
Will he still love me long after I'm gone?
Or did he see it comin' all along?

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Nikki Lane]
'Cause breakin' up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, and it's makin' me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely (Baby, breakin' up is hard to do)
Breakin' up slowly (Baby, breakin' up is hard to do)
Breakin' up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, and it's makin' me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely, but it's the right thing to do

[Verse 1]
It's easy to get frustrated
When you got no answers
It's easy to get overwhelmed
Make you wanna put the blame on somebody else
I can sympathize with ya
Yeah, I will always ride with ya
I'll be the one to cry with ya

[Chorus]
You can lay it on me, I won't leave you lonely
No, no-no-no-no-no-no
You can lay it on me, I won't leave you lonely
Lo-onely, no-oh, no-oh, no-oh
You can lay it on me, I won't leave you lonely

[Verse 2]
I can see you're in your head again
No, I can't stand to see you when you're strugglin'
Yeah, you need a little motivation
Remember, life is a celebration
Bad thoughts that cross for no perspective
And Lord knows I need some good direction
Maybe this time is of the essence

[Chorus]
You can lay it on me, I won't leave you lonely
No, no-no-no-no-no-no
You can lay it on me, I won't leave you lonely
Lo-onely, no-oh, no-oh, no-oh
You can lay it on me, I won't leave you lonely

[Intro]
(Incoming)

[Verse 1: DaBaby]
Let me get 'em, Ye
They gon' hate on a young nigga anyway
They only call me when they havin' bills to pay (Go)
Ain't nobody ask me how I feel today
I think about it and get in my feelings, Ye
Wanna use me, they think I'm stupid
Shit that they put out is very confusing
Feel like the media tryna abuse me
Y'all wanna crucify me, huh? (Oh yeah)
She a God-fearin' woman, but back that ass up
Juvenile in '99, now I'm tryna find peace, have to find a god
Ain't been havin' good sleep since my father died
Know our feelings are focused, I thought you know this
When there's prophets and mothеrfuckin' poets
You ain't got the mind to picture what my flow is
I'm straight from thе bottom, nigga, where the floor is
Went straight through the roof, like a nigga forgot where the door is (The roof)
Tryna make some shoes with YEEZY and Billion Dollar Baby clothing
They think 'cause we black, we supposed to hide our feelings and it's over
Nah, nigga, fuck that
She let me fuck after church on a Tuesday
Don't got a ring, but she gave me that coochie
Don't know how to make secular music
I hope Ye like it, I hope he still use it
I ain't fuckin' with niggas, I'm Gucci
They crumble in controversy, I be coolin' (Huh, huh)
Your chest beatin', lemme feel your heart
They might say I didn't, but I did my part
I never gave a fuck how niggas feel
And this damn sure ain't the day I'm finna start
Ye sent the beat that I could pick apart
Right now in this song, we at the minute mark
I walk down for a minute long
Put the top down, know I'm strapped with that glizzy
Ain't even mean to go get in my feelings
This is a powerful song, I can feel it
She don't got on drawers but she know all the scriptures
He could teach me the word, I'll never forget it
Forgive me and her, it's a time for repentin'
And it clap like, "Amen," from the back when I hit it
I'm black, I'm so black, I'm so black they can feel it
Paid three million cash in my taxes on Wednesday
The government, I'm payin' them millions to
They don't care about niggas when white people kill 'em

[Chorus: Kanye West, DaBaby, Kanye West & DaBaby, 2 Chainz]
Boy, we wasn't never no joke, nah, nah, nah
Say I got the same flow, ha, ha, ha
Like they say in New York, nigga, "Ah, ah, ah"
And everybody judgin' me, y'all not God
Overthrow, send the drones in
All the maneuvers, feelin' closed in
I don't need to strike back, I let God fight my battles
Ain't strapped with a TEC, laid it down, now where they at? (Uh!)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
If one more person call me and ask me, "What's wrong with Ye?"
That's a grown man, I can't tell him what he can and can't say
Never been a yes-man, so I don't feel like I have to explain
F y'all niggas, ex-drug dealer, ex-ball player, X Games (Uh)
Goin' down like Aspen, diamonds in the watch like Aspirin (Uh)
From the clay like Cassius, ride the beat, the seat-belt fastened (Uh)
Nah, nah, nah, nah, Johnny Gill, "My, My, My" (Tell 'em)
Use a diamond chain for a tie, had a connect before Wi-Fi (Woo)
Keep her on her toes, ballet ('Let), gotta stick to Cali (True)
Hard to park this in valet (True), if you ain't first, you last place (Last)
Ain't tryna brag but I'm straight (Straight)
I caught a case 'fore I caught a cold
This a Rolls Royce, I don't drag race
If rap don't work, I'll buy a stove
If rap don't work, I'll buy a scale
Make 'em nervous, start bitin' nails
Served 'em folks upstairs and downstairs, clientele on clientele
Spend a thirty in YSL, shawty thick, she a Clydesdale
I'm at Esco, double park in front of the firehouse and I'm fire as hell (Uh)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Boy, we wasn't never no joke, nah, nah, nah (Yeah)
All summer, murder he wrote, nah, nah, nah
Who they talkin' 'bout? Nah, nah, nah (Yeah)
Doin' everythin' they didn't allow, nah, nah
Overthrow, send the drones in
All the maneuvers, feelin' closed in
I don't need to strike back, I let God fight my battles
Ain't strapped with a TEC, laid it down, now where they at?

[Chorus]
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you’re running outta time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?

[Verse 1]
You're so indecisive, what I'm saying
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don’t know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?

[Pre-Chorus]
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then you're down and thеn between
Oh, I really wanna know…

[Chorus]
What do you mean?
Whеn you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running outta time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?

[Verse 2]
You're overprotective when I’m leaving
Tryna compromise but I can’t win
You wanna make a point, but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end

[Pre-Chorus]
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you’re up, then you're down and then between
Oh, I really wanna know…

[Chorus]
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean?
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running outta time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind

[Outro]
What do you mean?
Don’t be so selfish baby, yeah
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean now? Hey-ey
Oh, oh tudurudururu
Oh, oh, hey, yeah yeah
What do you mean?

[Verse 1]
My life is a movie and everyone's watching
So let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting

[Chorus]
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There's onе thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you

[Verse 2]
I've got to learn things, lеarn them the hard way
Got to see what it feels like, no matter what they say

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting

[Chorus]
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you

[Outro: Acoustic]

Ohhhhhh, ohh

Ohhhhhh, ohh

[Refrain]
There've been no lies, there's been no wait in me
Dawn or night
Tell me you'll call
Tell me you waitin' on my mind
Tell me to wait, tell me to love
Tell me to go
Tell me I've been lost on my phone
See you again, see you again, see you again
Have I been on my mind?
And I've been wasting time?
Believing you'll come back to me

[Chorus]
I will fly with you
If you ain't happy now
I will fly with you
And I've been waiting
I will fly with you
Yeah, fly with you

[Chorus]
See you again, see you again
See you again
I thought I had enough
You could have enough
And I've been waiting, I'll fly with you
If you ain't happy now
I will fly with you, yeah

[Intro: Dua Lipa]
Words I speak
Live then breathe
Lets us breathe
Words I speak
Live then breathe

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Did you ever think of follow reason
Follow reason, can not see my face
Law of attraction, means I'm lost in passion
Means I got what I asked for, exactly what I asked for

Poker face

[Bridge]
I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
'Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin

Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand 'cause I'm marvelous

[Verse 1]
I think you wanna come over
Yeah, I heard it through the grapevine
Are you drunk? Are you sober?
Think about it, doesn't matter
And if it makes you feel good, then I say do it
I don't know what you're waiting for

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel my temperature rising
There's too much heat, I'm gonna lose control
Do you want to go higher? Get closer to the fire?
I don't know what you’re waiting for

[Chorus]
Come join the party, yeah
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started, yeah
'Cause everybody wants to party with you

[Verse 2]
Boy, you got a reputation
But you're gonna have to prove it
I see a little hesitation
Am I gonna have to show you
That if it feels right, get on your mark
Step to the beat, boy, that's what it's for

[Pre-Chorus]
Put your arms around me
When it gets too hot, we can go outside
But for now, just come here, let me whisper in your ear
An invitation to the dance of life

[Chorus]
Come join the party
It's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
No more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
Body, body, body, body...
Come join the party
It's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do

[Outro]
Everybody wants somebody...

[Part I]

[Intro]
I can't help but feel neglected
Changin' up the schedule, your calendar refreshin'
Time pass and we move on, nobody says shit
How I'm 'posed to act when my morals ain't respected?
How you 'posed to act when your feelings ain't protected?
I'm cashin' checks just to get some neck and some necklaces
What's next? War and turbulence, prayin' on this plane
Success, got a taste of it, never was the same

[Verse 1]
Trademark on that pussy, trademarkin' my brand-new bitch
Yеah, duh, hol' up, blood, hol' up, cuh, hol' up, sis, huh (Hol' up)
LLC the Glock and I LLC my bitch, huh (LLC)
Pass me the rock, I go crazy on my kicks, huh
Had to tеll my grandma, "Sit back, relax" and shit, huh (Make nigga)
Make nigga buy her house and car, she's off the list, huh
Fake nigga, talkin' 'bout he rich but barely is, huh
Eight figures, jumpin' off the stage into the kids, huh (Yeah)
Single out the shooter, take the shooter to the blitz, huh (Yeah)
Droppin' out of school, dropped deposit on their crib, huh (Yeah)
Poppin' out on Instagram, I only post my bitch, huh
I don't need your input, get your two cents off my pic, huh
Generation money, type of money dyin' rich
And I wanna say, "Shoutout to the dead, now I flex," woah

[Chorus]
Shoutout to the dead, to the dead, to the dead, huh
Shoutout to the dead, to the dead, to the dead, huh (Let's go)
Shoutout to the dead, to the dead, to the dead, huh (Let's go)
Shoutout to the dead, to the dead, to the dead, huh (One)

[Verse 2]
I'm sick of you niggas not taking a risk
I'm taking advantage and taking my course (Kill 'em)
I cannot compete with the mud in my system
My tolerance low, I don't tolerate force
I protect, I am the one
I rose up for the score
I gotta let my ego go
You niggas not ready to settle the war (Yeah)
You niggas not ready to stop bein' hoes
You niggas not ready to open the doors
You niggas run in, take off with the drawer
You niggas not really the richest on Forbes
You niggas not ready to deal with the sacrifices
And instead, you're passin' the torch
And check the surveillance camera at the cemetery
See me dancin' on all of your corpse, go

[Segue]
You could only have love
Ooh, could I say it more?
Could I say it more?

[Part II]

[Verse 1: Baby Keem]
Ayy, E38
Got pulled over twice, had to go and switch plates
Bitch, don't think shit sweet
I'm the same Baby Keem in forty-eight states
I play charades with the bank
Just net ten million, now I'm back with the Wraith
And I'm goin' home with the loot
Mama goin' home with a coupe

[Chorus: ROSALÍA & Baby Keem]
I'm a hot girl
A hot girl
I'm a hot girl (Make me lose my mind)
A hot girl

[Verse 2: Baby Keem]
I took the 'Lac then hopped on the flight
I cannot look towards your jaded advice
I took the torch, I quit being nice
I took the torch, now I gotta fight
You niggas impulsive, quick to make moves
You're biting your flows, a big appetite
I look at the hoes, they not at your shows
I look at your shows, they Oprah white
You gotta be nimble and quick like a fox
I don't move in silence, this shit is abrupt
I'm VVS-ed up, precise in the cut
Did she get a nut? It's not about me
As long as you good, don't worry 'bout me
I'm telling my friends that you not a freak
My new Nia Long is Kaepernick strong
And she not afraid to get on one knee
I'm back at the crib, my memory deep
I think about mama, I'm Baby Hykeem
She got that tatted before I could read
I'm spiritual now, I pray in my sleep
Twenty years long, I never had dad
My dad was a fraud, I had to be tough
Twenty million, ho, that's not enough
Don't ask no questions, bitch, go add it up
I took the light to sacrifice
I sacrificed everything I need
I could probably fuck these bitches in my sleep
Young nigga know the hustle and the Ps
Stressing 'bout money, turned to other things
I was in uncle crib at fourteen
Can't get through to mama 'cause she'd rather drink
Facin' eviction by the thirteenth

[Refrain: Baby Keem]
I was fifteen, I was sixteen
I was fifteen, I was sixteen
I was fifteen, I was sixteen
I was fifteen, I was sixteen

[Chorus: ROSALÍA & Baby Keem]
I'm a hot girl
A hot girl
I'm a hot girl (Make me lose my mind)
A hot girl

[Verse 1]
The hills are alive
With the sound of music
With songs they have sung
For a thousand years

The hills fill my heart
With the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to beat
Like the wings of the birds that rise
From the lake to the trees

My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze

To laugh like a brook
When it trips and falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to pray
I go to the hills
When my heart is lonely
I know I will hear
What I've heard bеfore

My heart will be blеssed
With the sound of music
And I'll sing once more

[Verse 2]
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites, when the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

[Verse 3]
Edelweiss, Edelweiss
Bless my homeland forever

[Verse 4]
Climb ev'ry mountain
Ford ev'ry stream
Follow ev'ry rainbow
'Til you find your dream
A dream that will need
All the love you can give
Every day of your life
For as long as you live

Climb ev'ry mountain
Ford ev'ry stream
Follow ev'ry rainbow
'Til you find your dream

[Verse 1]
She dances in his sheets at night
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

[Chorus]
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm, to the rhythm
Rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm

[Bridge]
She works so hard just to make her way
For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Yet she could not stop, couldn't break his chains
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

[Chorus]
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
Love, love, love, love

[Verse 1]
There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know that that's the truth
Because now it's onto me

[Refrain]
I don't understand it, hey
I don't understand it, OW

[Verse 2]
There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul has fallen

[Chorus]
I don't understand it
Got ghosts, got 'em breakin' the walls
Got ghouls, got 'em breakin' the halls, gotta see, won't ya
Don't understand it
Got ghosts, got 'em breakin' the walls
Got ghouls, got 'em breakin' the halls, gotta see, won't ya
Got ghosts, got 'em breakin' the walls
Got ghouls, got 'em breakin' the halls, gotta see, won't ya
Got ghosts, got 'em breakin' the walls
Got ghouls, got 'em breakin' the halls, gotta see

[Bridge]
And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to share my baby? She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?
The ghost of jealousy

[Verse 3]
There's a thumping in the floor

And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to share my baby? She needs me
Who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion to see me?
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to share my baby? She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me!
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?
A suckin' ghost of jealousy
OW

[Outro]
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to share my baby? She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree? (Oh no)
And who gave you the right to take intrusion to see me?
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to share my baby? She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?

[Verse 1]
He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot wheeled in the place
Keep daring to motivate
He say one day you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fire's deep in his eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land?
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan?
Everybody sing

[Chorus]
Every day crеate your history
Every path you take you'rе leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

[Verse 2]
Don't let no one get you down
Keep moving on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self-motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history

[Pre-Chorus]
How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land?
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand?
Everybody sing

[Chorus]
Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

[Post-Chorus]
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

[Pre-Chorus]
How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land?
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And be a family? Oh

[Chorus]
Every day create your history
(History)
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
(Legacy)
Every soldier dies in his glory
(His glory)
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

Every hero dreams of chivalry

Every child should sing together in harmony
(Yeah yeah, together, together)

[Outro]
A soldier dies
A mother cries
The promised child shines in a baby's eyes
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

[Verse 1]
Join the last migration
It's fun, fuck the system
Your new mess made is great
King of a bald primate
We are not worthy
Of our heir's glory
Mental rotation for the overlord
(Woo!)

Superorganism
Caused a schism bending light through prisms
Cyber surgeon

Prepare for mutation because after all, I'm sure I heard the crack of doom

[Chorus]
Just strollin' down the street, and I'm coolin'
Get somethin' good to eat, now I'm coolin'
Don't worry 'bout the money, I'm just goin' with the flow
Enjoyin' every single day 'cause life is dope, woah

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, hey
New day, new city
Travel across the country, picked up like a kidney
Shit, we smokin' like a hippie
Feelin' trippy, gettin' jiggy, tryna boogie it down like it's the '60s
DJ, could you play my song?
What we would hear when we was spittin', always stayin' long
They sleepin' on me, 

[?] PJ's is on
Now the beat drop kinda how you break your bong
Days is long, but the nights is longer
Funny how 

[?] might be proper
Lemonade and ice tea, made an Arnold Palmer
Sittin' by the pool with some bitches playin' doctor

[?] skinny dippin', plenty women would be chillin'
Feelin' like I'm simple livin', cooler than the air condition room
So I peaced on a deuce: 

[?]
Spittin' exactly how I'm livin', hey

[Chorus]
Just strollin' down the street, and I'm coolin'
Get somethin' good to eat, now I'm coolin'
Don't worry 'bout the money, I'm just goin' with the flow
Enjoyin' every single day 'cause life is dope, woah

[Verse 2]
Acid rains drops on a cocaine brain
Got a marijuana mind, talkin' dope boy swag
The boy doper than Kurt Cobain
People tryna act like they ain't heard my name before

[?] to the core
Tryna walk into the mall with money, cleanin' out the store
Used to be a scrub and now I'm gettin' all this love
Probably because these motherfuckers see I got it buzzed

[?] diss my song, you better put it on
And I stay with thumbs up like The Fonz
Ayy, cooler than the sun shade
Feelin' like a lazy motherfucker on a Sunday
One day, my money gon' be tall like Dikembe Mutombo

[?] bow to your sensei
Never follow what both my parents say
'Cause life is dope and we get paid, hey

[Chorus]
Just strollin' down the street, and I'm coolin'
Get somethin' good to eat, now I'm coolin'
Don't worry 'bout the money, I'm just goin' with the flow
Enjoyin' every single day 'cause life is dope, woah

[Guitar By James Bay]

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Outro]
'Said if you like thе way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself

[Verse 1]
Ended up on a crossroad
Tried to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

[Chorus]
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

[Verse 2]
Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart, it's just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent in an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

[Chorus]
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh
Life is worth living again

[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Can we both say the words and forget this
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Chorus]
Sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and  fuck yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and fuck yourself

[Verse 2]
And when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
When you tried to tell me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song

I don't, but you still hit my phone up

Oh baby, you should go and fuck yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and fuck yourself

[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down these walls?

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and fuck yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and fuck yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and fuck yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and fuck yourself

[Outro]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and fuck yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and 

[fuck] yourself

I don't work harder when it's easy

It was more than a season
And I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you that you're the one

Life is all good when you're around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now

'Cause I'll take you home to mama
Let you meet my friends

Drop and stomp your whole heart 'til it stops
Call the cops, I'ma beat your ass while they watch

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
Ha ha, now we got the whole industry makin fun of you Erik

You a petty coward, you ain't ready to steady go a round
With some killers from 7 Mile to the motherfuckin Belle Isle Bridge

Grab 380's when you see Slim Shady

Got in his ass and now this faggot wanna mention me still

Tryin to throw a fuckin punch, but you just chokin
Havin a stroke and now you learn why crackers never earned a dime
Cause you SUCK motherfucker you should learn to rhyme
Talkin 'bout you packin pistols but it's funny to me
You ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me
I'm a paleface killer whale
On his way to fuckin prison, pistol whippin tail, ha
Erik remember when I passed you in the lobby that day?
That shit was obvious you probably was gay, ha
Now it's all about country, you gave up hip-hop
Forty-nine thousand copies, the week your shit drop
While my
Sales
Makin records break
Two and a half million scanned by the second week
Motherfucker I hit 'em up

[Verse 5: Proof]
I'm from Detroit's Pemberton Ave., where bullets tear you in half
Fuck the music, we got an uzi for all you fags

All you underground bitches get your throats cut

[Verse 6: Swifty]
What the fuck?! Is you stupid?
I choke Whitey Ford with his fuckin guitar cord
And
Stuff
Him in cardboard, chopped up in a box
With sixteen parts, I stomped on his heart
D-12, Amityville, fuck your mother while you watch
Keep your restaraunt locked and block your door
Cause we "Hit 'Em Up" like motherfuckin 2Pac Shakur

[Verse 7: Eminem]
You a, "Black Jesus," heart attack seizures
Too many cheeseburgers McDonald's Big Mac greases
White devil, washed up honkey
Mixed up cracker who crossed over to country

[Outro]
Yo, aiyyo cut this shit off
Fuck him, that's it, I'm done, I promise, I'm done, that's it

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
If you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]
When you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 1]
Let's end each other's lonely nights
Be each other's paradise
Need a picture for my frame
Someone to share my reign
Tell me what you wanna drink
I'll tell you what I got in mind
Oh, I don't know your name
But I feel like that's gonna change

[Pre-Chorus]
You ain't gotta be my lover
For you to call me baby
Never been about no pressure
Ain't that serious

[Chorus]
Can we, we keep
Keep each other company? (Oh)
Maybe we, can be
Be each other's company
Oh company

[Post-Chorus]
Oooooooooh
Oooooooooh
Oooooooooh
Oooooooooh

[Verse 2]
It's not about the complications
I'm all about the elеvation
We can keep it goin' up
Oh, don't miss out on us
Just wanna have a conversation
Forgеt about the obligations
Maybe we can stay in touch
Oh that ain't doin' too much

[Pre-Chorus]
You ain't gotta be my lover
For you to call me baby
Never been about no pressure
Ain't that serious, no

[Chorus]
Can we, we keep
Keep each other company?
Ohh, Maybe we, can be
Be each other's company
Oh company

[Post-Chorus]
Oooooooooooh
Oooooooooooh
Oooooooooooh
Oooooooooooh

[Chorus]
If I believe in love
And you believe in love
Then we could be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now

[Verse 1]
Growing pains come along with these changes
Some people get closer
Some people separate, yeah
Don’t think we should separate
When we both adore one another
You’re a dream come true
We should start over brand new
That’s what we oughta do, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes the heart can see
What’s invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don’t ever lie
Giving up is immature
We got so much more to live for
They don’t wanna see us together now
Cause we are strong enough to endure, oh

[Chorus]
If I believe in love
And you believe in love
Then we can be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now

[Verse 2]
Don’t let this effort go to waste
Put our all in it
Don’t wanna be left with the question, why?
Let’s be honest with ourselves
Did we really come this far
Just to watch it go down the drain?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, sometimes the heart can see
What’s invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don’t ever lie
Giving up is immature
We got so much more to live for
They don’t wanna see us together now
Let's be strong enough to endure, oh

[Chorus]
If I believe in love
And you believe in love
Then we can be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now

[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Verse 2]
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Bridge]
I'm not just trying to get you back on me (Oh, no, no)
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body (Your body)
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Outro]
Is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm not just trying to get you back on me (Oh, no, no)
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body (Your body)
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

Pardon the uh, technical difficulties
Pardon the uh, technical difficulties

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Boys can't keep up with it
I'm like "we shall spit it"
I'm like both wheels spinnin'
I'm like both Will Smith kids
I know both Will Smith kids
I'm so focused this is 2.0 in this bitch
Give me life (Yeah)
Live and direct from Los Angeles
Niggas ain't talk to you carefully
Niggas wanna harm me (Ay)
Ring the alarm class
Can't stop Beyonce, hanging out with (Actors)
Niggas in Chateau, niggas got rappers
Hoodie and a capture (Cap on)
Backwards (Plug got a)
Password (Live from)
Fuck it everything in the trick straight miss ay Grey Goose
Pull up in this bitch like niggas ain't shit
You scared as shit, yeah man, doing that really ain't nothing
These people want my lifе, gon' run out of fun shit
Pull up to the function, already zooted
Bungalo on Kubrick, always a studеnt
Always absorbing, I'm already bored
I'm already gorgeous
Look what he importing, it cost me a fortune
Look at my smile, you know I been tortured
Look at my style, you know I'm important
If only the corpses
Doin it for, doin' it for, doin' it for

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Woop! Woop! Woop! Woop! Uh!
Shit on your function, live from the dungeon (Woo! Damn!)
Dont know why you cuffin', my dick she be tonguin'
You ain't got drip like this, can't talk like this (Woo)
Safety pin on wrists (Woop! Woo!), diamond on bliss
Speaking the truth, 2k a tooth (Ooh!)
Maybach Jeep, raise the roof
Know that you envy me, but I am hater-proof
Talking with Diddy
I made me a milli' in about a day or two (Woop! Ay!)
Filled with lust
Wanted a meet with Hype Williams
Talkin 'bout bitches that I wanna bust
We supposed to be talking 'bout video treatments
And such (Damn!)
But I'm busy lovin' on the IG
Smut, damn, fuck!
I'm a G.O.A.T. in a Lamb' truck

[Intro: Kanye West]
Yeah, 9:08 L.A. time
Back in the lab and shit

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My wife said I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in they control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with no permission, on our own conditions
Most blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Yeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringin', go and get your kids ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout "how my neck look?"
Well... it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people (real!)
I've been woken from enlightened man's dream
Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave 20 to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern day MJ with a off the wall flow

[Bridge: Sampha]
Nightlife, walk all over me
Walk all over me
I'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent that you'll bring
Fly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)

[Verse 3: Sampha]
Please face me when I speak
Please say to me something before you leave
You've been treating me like I'm invisible, now I'm invisible to you
Oh invisible truths they say, I can't quite understand what you say
Understand, understand, understand I'm standing under oath with my hand on the book
Tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth
And you always give me half of you, half of you
Take half of a shot
Won't you let my heart go?
Make you feel something that I'm feeling

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)

Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
That's Flacko
That's Jodie, (Huh?)
That's me (Huh?)
Fasho me, (Huh?)
It's on me (Huh?)
She blow me (Huh?)
She know me (Aye)

[Chorus: A$AP Bari]
Knock his head off (Aye)
Knock his head off (Aye)
Knock his head off (Aye)
Knock his head off (Aye)
Knock his head off (Aye)
Knock his head off (Aye)
Knock his head off (Aye)
Knock his head off (Aye)

[Verse 2: A$AP Bari]
I'ma knock his head off (Uh)
Fuck no boy I ain't scared O's
And it goes for all of y'all (All of y'all)
Nigga not just one that's all
Bitch I'm the biggest dog (Roof)

[Verse 1]
Riddle me this
Did you ever grow?
Break the spider's legs
Just to feed the crow
Sympathetic crowds
Are not well endowed
They dance like flies on shit
Swarming in the clouds

[Chorus]
This is to all of the people
Who had it coming
A few bickies too many
(I'm so lonely)
It's to all of the people
Who said they couldn't hack it
I'll open their eyes

[Post-Chorus]
To minimum brain size

[Verse 2]
Re-enter the uterus
And refund all your cells
Do it back-to-front
Like nobody else
Stay there for a while
"When you're back inside
You will not be missed"
Said the tear to the eye

[Bridge]
It's pathetic though
You're weaker than you know
Parasitic mob
Faceless undertow
Himpathetic bro
You're weaker than you know
You don't have a say
A-a-anymore

[Chorus]
This is to all of the people
Who had it coming
A few bickies too many
(I'm so lonely)
It's to all of the people
Who said they couldn't hack it
Radicalise

[Instrumental Break]

[Post-Chorus]
To minimum brain size

[Outro]
It's pathetic though
You're weaker than you know
Parasitic mob
Lowest of the low
Himpathetic bro
You're weaker than you know
You don't have a say
A-a-anymore
At the center of it all
You ain't got the gall
You're pissing on a flame
Standing on a ball
It's pathetic though
You're weaker than you know
You don't have a say
A-a-anymore
A-a-anymore

[Intro]
Woo
(Woo)

[Verse 1]
Now there is something that's on my mind
Now there is something I cannot hide
Why is there anyone? Why do we think?
What is the point of it? Why anything?
Why is there anything? What is the link?
What is the point of it? Why anything?

[Chorus]
Don’t question
Thinking for yourself
Is an overrated thing
Be free
Woo

[Verse 2]
What can be said to exist inside
A simulation inside my mind?
What is the meaning? What is a thing?
What is the point of it? Why anything?
How many levels of ontology?
What is the point of it? Why anything?

[Chorus]
Don't question
Thinking for yourself
Is an overrated thing
Be free
Woo

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Woo

[Verse 1]
Don't take it personally, this is not about you
I begin to slide inward and throughout to
Shatter the static silencing my mind
Find the rhythm and set course to collide

Don't take it personally
My hands are disappearing
Dissolving in a tear
I am not needed here

[Pre-Chorus]
Starting to feel something
I think I'm taking off
I think I'm feeling something
Will I evaporate?
Is this me feeling something?
I've got a bird's eye view
I have shed my skin
Look at me now

[Chorus]
Intra-intrasport
Perish to my thought
My hand is on the gun
It's intra-intrasport
Get to me before
My face splashes in the sky

[Verse 2]
I used to drеam about killing certain people
Drеams that sew me up like sleeping with a needle
Those feelings that I had were building up to something
I feel a schism in the rhythm, now I'm running

My hair is liquifying
My taste buds are igniting
It's true, I am evolving
It's all relative

[Pre-Chorus]
Starting to feel something
I think I'm taking off
I think I'm feeling something
Will I evaporate?
Is this me feeling something?
I've got a bird's eye view
I have shed my skin
Look at me now

[Chorus]
Intra-intrasport
Perish to my thought
My hand is on the gun
It's intra-intrasport
Get to me before
My face splashes in the sky
Intra-intrasport
Perish to my thought
My hand is on the gun
It's intra-intrasport
Get to me before
My face splashes in the sky
Intra-intrasport
Perish to my thought
My hand is on the gun
It's intra-intrasport
Get to me before
My face splashes in the sky
Intra-intrasport
Perish to my thought
My hand is on the gun
It's intra-intrasport
Get to me before
My face splashes in the sky

[Outro]
Don't
Do
It

[Verse 1]
All this rock and roll is bad for my ears
Let me tell you one thing about my life, it's weird
All this headbangin' is bad for my brain
Let me tell you one thing about my life, it's strange

[Pre-Chorus]
Sugar Plum Fairy dances now
Echoed feet on the hallowed ground
Energy peaks on the voyager's crown
Back to the bus for another round
Managing feats by managing feet
Head of the hydra tastes the breeze
Conduit sees from the living room suite
Boredom is what boredom breeds, you see

[Chorus]
So deranged
Life is strange
It's human
Odd life, woo

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
All this indecision in anthropods
Let me tеll you one thing about our life, it's odd
All this wire walking upon thе knife
Let me tell you one thing 'bout human odd life

[Pre-Chorus]
Sugar Plum Fairy dances now
Echoed feet on the hallowed ground
Energy peaks on the voyager's crown
Back to the bus for another round
Managing feats by managing feet
Head of the hydra tastes the breeze
Conduit sees from the living room suite
Boredom is what boredom breeds, you see

[Chorus]
Bitumen
Crossroad knife
It's human
Odd life, woo

[Bridge]
No concept of geography
I wake up and I'm still fatigued
I'm drinking 'til I'm dead asleep
Ridin' high 'til I'm back home in one piece
Another car park in the middle of nowhere
Another promoter hanging in your hair
Another backstage green room to prepare
It's an odd life, gotta be aware

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
It's an odd life 'til you get it right
It's an odd life 'til you get it right
It's an odd life 'til you get it right
It's an odd life 'til you get it right
It's an odd life 'til you get it right
It's an odd life 'til you get it right
It's an odd life 'til you get it right
It's an odd life 'til you get in the stride

[Outro]
It's an odd life
'Til you get it right
It's an odd life
'Til you get it right
It's an odd life
'Til you get it right
Odd life
Odd life
Odd life
Odd life

[Verse 1]
Would you throw our construction to the hungry wolf of fate?

[Chorus]
Do it again 'cause we're mindless pissants
Do it again 'cause we haven't learned sense
Do it again so we auto-cremate
Don't do it again because it isn't safe

[Verse 2]
Death looms like a leering figure
Bring our species into sight

[Chorus]
Do it again 'cause we're mindless pissants
Do it again 'cause we haven't learned sense
Do it again so we auto-cremate
Don't do it again because it isn't safe

[Bridge]
Would you throw your deduction to thе hungry wolf of fate?
Fill his plate with your namesakе
Fatten him with your ego

[Chorus]
Do it again 'cause we're mindless pissants
Do it again 'cause we haven't learned sense
Do it again so we auto-cremate
Don't do it again because it isn't safe

[Outro]
Woo!

My name is Dita
I'll be your mistress tonight
I'll be your loved one darling
Turn off the light

Wе could use the cage
I've got a lot of rope
I'm not full of rage
I'm full of hope
This is not a crime and you're not on trial
Bend over baby, I'm going to make you smile
Light the candles, until they're nice and soft
And when they start to drip, I'm going to get you off

[Pre-Chorus]
Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to...
I'd like to put you in a trance
Just close your eyes

Put your hands all over my body

[Verse 1]
If I take you from behind
Push myself into your mind
When you least expect it
Will you try and reject it?
If I'm in charge
And I treat you like a child
Will you let yourself go wild
Let my mouth go where it wants to?

[Pre-Chorus]
Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to...
I'd like to put you in a trance
All over

[Verse 2]
Once you put your hand in the flame
You can never be the same
There's a certain satisfaction
In a little bit of pain
I can see you understand
I can tell that you're the same
If you're afraid, we'll rise above
I only hurt the ones I love

[Pre-Chorus]
Give it up, do as I say
Give it up and let me have my way
I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck
I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to
I'd like to put you in a trance

[Verse 1]
Blacked out on a weekday
Still something that I'm trying to avoid
Start asking for forgiveness in advance
For all the future things I will destroy
That way I can ruin everything
When I do, you don't get to act surprised
When it finally gets to be too much
I always told you you could leave at any time
Until then, I'll split the difference
Between medicine and poison
Take what I can get away with
While it burns right through my stomach
I'm telling my own fortune
Something I cannot escape
I can see where this is going
But I can't find the brake

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Knocked out on a weekend
Would you hit me this hard if I wеre a boy?
See, I don't need you to defend mе
'Cause it's just the sort of thing that I enjoy
Took the fall, I draw a hard line
When I cross it, it's the third time
Say my own name in the mirror
And when nobody appears
Say it's not so cut and dry
Oh, it isn't black and white
What if it's all black, baby?
All the time

[Outro]
Oh, all the time
Oh, all the time
Oh, all the time

[Verse 1]
Ooh, I miss it high, how it dulled the terror and the beauty
And now I see everything in startling intensity
Oh, what I wouldn't give if it would take away the sting a minute
Everything I love, I'd trade it in to feel it rush into my chest

[Verse 2]
The smoke alarm's been going off for weeks
No one showed up and half the time it isn't what you think of

[Chorus]
Faith healer, come put your hands on me
A snake oil dealer
I'll believe you if you make me feel something
Oh, faith healer, come put your hands all over me
A snake oil dealer
I'll believe you if you make me feel something

[Verse 1]
Shell of an engine, unexplained
Burst to fire engulfed in flames
Breathing exhaust, a heatwave mirage
Nothing to lose till everything's really gone
It's worse than death that life compressed
To fill a page in the Sunday paper
I had the shuddering thought:
"This was gonna make me late for work"

[Verse 2]
Biting a chain, free like a lame
Oh, can you be healed?
Scratch my knees on the gravel
Say it's all part of the deal
Coverеd in scars a canyon deep
It's not like what I thought it'd be
The gruеsome beauty of your face in everyone I meet

[Chorus]
I was on a long spiral down
Before I make it to the ground
I'll wrap Orion's belt around my neck
And kick the chair out
On a long spiral down
Before I make it to the ground
I'll wrap Orion's belt around my neck
And kick the chair out
And I'll kick the chair out
Kick the chair out

[Verse 1]
Midnight, you could see me dangling
Glow like a cherry falling, now it's a downpour
You could see me racing the rain to the ground floor
You're the only thing I'll wait around for
Maybe when you get off of work, you should meet me
We could go barreling down the main street
You could try watching while I run through the high-beams

[Bridge]
'Cause if I didn't have a mean bone in my body
I'd find some other way to cause you pain
I won't bother telling you I'm sorry
For something that I'm gonna do again

[Verse 2]
When I could spend the weekend out on a bender
Do I get callous or do I stay tender?
Which of these is worse and which is better?
Dying to myself, virtually a massacre
A character of somebody's invention
A martyr in another passion play
I guess I don't mind losing my conviction
If it's all relative fiction anyway

[Verse 3]
'Cause I don't need a savior, I need you to take me home
I don't need your help, I need you to leave me alone
I'm out where the drunks at the bar talk over the band
I try to express, I can't understand
I beat at the keys, I bloody my hands
'Til you hear me
I've got no business praying
I'm finished being good
Now I can finally be okay and not the way I thought I should
Mm-mm

[Verse 1]
Day-one chip on your dresser
Get loaded at your house
I ask if you remember
You say, "I don't know what you're talking about"
Swallow the truth
Force the charcoal down my throat
Finally come to, maybe I'll have something to show
It's the first day of the new year
All the visitors went home
I found out what I thought was just a pretty trick of smoke
Couldn't stand the thought of having everything to lose
So I tied a knot

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not crying wolf
I'm out here looking for them
In the morning when I wake up
Naked in their den
I swear off all the things I thought that got me here
In the evening, I'll come back again

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not crying wolf
I'm out here looking for them
In the morning when I wake up
Naked in their den
Ooh, I'm out here looking for them
In the morning when I wake up
Naked in their den
And I swear off all the things I thought that got me here
In the evening, I'll come back again

[Verse 1]
I can see myself inside your bloodshot eyes
Wondering if you can see yourself in mine
Or do you just see me?
And of me, what you want to see
Middle of the night, all I can see are stars
Pulled 'em from my eyes and your ex-lover's arms
Throw hook after hook and if I were you
After all that I did, I'd have done it to me, too

[Refrain]
Isn't like I did it on purpose
I just forget the second I learned it
Everything I get, I deserve
You whisper to me
"Don't you like when it hurts?"
Oh-mm, mm-mm

[Verse 2]
Five days out from thе initial event
It's two kinds of pills to unclench my fists
It's too kind of you to say you can hеlp
But there's no one around who can save me from myself

[Refrain]
Isn't like I do this on purpose
I just forget the second I've learned it
Looking for little oblivions
I'd do anything knowing you would forgive me, oh

[Chorus]
There's no glory in love
Only the gore of our hearts
So let it come for my throat
Take me and tear me apart

[Chorus]
Ooh, there's no glory in love
Only the gore of our hearts
Ooh, let it come for my throat
Take me and tear me apart

[Outro]
Drag me away in the dark
Take me and tear me apart

[Verse 1]
Beat myself until I'm bloody
And I'll give you a ringside seat
Say that it's embarrassing
I'm sorry that you had to see me like that

[Verse 2]
So you could either watch me drown
Or try to save me while I drag you down
Wanna fix it, but I don't know how
It isn't fair to make you wait around
While all your friends are going out

[Verse 3]
So Jesus, can you help me now?
Trade me in for a briar crown
Is there anybody coming back for me?
If they ever were, they are not now

[Chorus]
So what's there left to talk about?
I'm holding on just like a scratch-off ticket
How I dig my nails into your skin
Honey, I'm not stupid
I know no one wins this kind of thing
It's just another way to kill an hour
Wishing I was different
Nobody deserves a second chance
But, honey, I keep getting them

[Outro]
Like a scratch-off ticket
How you dig your nails into my skin
Honey, I'm not stupid
I know no one wins this kind of thing
It's just another way to kill an hour
Wishing I were different
Nobody deserves a second chance
But I keep giving them

[Verse 1]
We took the forty down to
Visit the family, and I
Told you the only kin I knew
Was who I could see from the gurney
I used to think about myself
Like I was a talented liar
Turns out that all my friends were
Trying to do me a favor

[Chorus 1]
I always wanna tell the truth
But it never seems like the right time
To be serious enough
I'm sorry I'm making myself cry

[Post-Chorus]
How long do I have until
I've spent up everyone's goodwill?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Sat on the hood, out all night
Trying to scrape together change
You pulled a moth out
From the grill of your truck
Saying it's a shame
How come it's so much еasier
With anything less than human
Letting yoursеlf be tender?
Well, you couldn't make me do it

[Chorus 2]
It doesn't feel too bad, but it
Doesn't feel too good, either
Just like a nicotine patch, it
Hardly works, then it's over

[Bridge]
Who put me
In your way to find?
And what right had you
Not to let me die?
Ooh, but did I even know
What I was asking for?
If I had my way
I'd have missed you more
Than you missed me
You missed me

[Outro]
You missed me
You missed me

[Verse 1]
I wish that I drank
Because of you and not only because of me
And then I could blame something painful enough
Not to make me look any more weak

[Verse 2]
When you heard my name
You could be angry and have a good reason to be
And then when I sang
A horrible drunken parade of my worst thoughts
I'd say, "Give me no sympathy"
It's the mercy I can't take

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Oh, I wish you'd come over
Not to stay, just to tell me that I
Was your biggest mistake to my face
And then leave me alone
In an еmpty apartment, face down in the carpеt
I wish you'd hurt me
It's the mercy I can't take

[Verse 1]
Ocean of strip malls
I help you swim across
To the other side
Of the truck stop light
When the drugs wear off
Will the love kick in?
Would you stay out long enough
To start again?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
On and on and on, I chase your form across the bed
Leave it up to me
Until you come to turn it in
Say I miss you like a mantra
'Til I forget what it means
Doesn't matter what you tell me
I just need to hear you speak

[Chorus]
All my greatest fears turn out to be the gift of prophecy
All my nightmares coming true
Come do my outline in the street
While every night I reenact thе same recurring dream
Now I'm stuck insidе a vision that repeats, repeats, repeats
Repeats, repeats, repeats, repeats, repeats
Repeats, repeats, repeats, repeats, repeats

[Verse 1]
Passed out in the back of a cab
Could you pull over? I think that I'm trapped
Caught underwater, I beat on the glass
Gnawing my arm at the shoulder
Would you help me get out?

[Chorus]
Ooh, it's a highlight reel
Tell me how you feel

[Verse 2]
Pulling down a projector
Scratched in the back of my eyes
Hovering over, tangled in the power lines

[Chorus]
Ooh, it's a highlight reel
Tell me how you feel

[Bridge]
Tell me what snuffed out the wick in your eye
Pumping your chest to make sure you're alive
When it dies, you can tell me how much was a lie
I guess that's for me to decide

[Outro]
When it dies, you can tell me how much was a lie
Oh, I guess, oh, I guess, oh, I guess
That's for me to decide

[Verse 1]
Limping like a prodigal son
Someone got my head in the slums
Everything I do makes it worse
Human nature, call it a curse
Tired of collecting my scars
And stories at the parties and bars
Tryna find a reason to fight
Someone's got my head in a zip tie

[Chorus]
Oh, good God
When you gonna call it off?
Climb down off of the cross
And change your mind?

[Verse 2]
Catch me on the enemy line
Hocking all the gold in my teeth
Oh, I was disappointed to find out how much
Everybody looks like me

[Chorus]
Oh, good God
When you gonna call it off?
Climb down off of the cross
And change your mind?
Good God
When you gonna call it off?
Climb down off of the cross
And change your mind?

[Verse 1]
Well, I can find my way
I know my left from right
Because we never close
I'm open day and night

[Verse 2]
I know my way around
I walk towards the light
I'm open 'round the clock
I don't get lost at night

[Chorus]
You never used to be afraid of days like these
But now you're overwhelmed by your anxieties
Let me help you out, let me be your guide
I can help you reach the love you feel inside

[Verse 1]
Well, I can find my way
I know my left from right
Because we never close
I'm open day and night
Ooh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh yeah

You never used to be afraid of days like these

Let me help you out, let me be your guide

I'm open 'round the clock
I don't get lost at night

[Chorus]
Look into my lens
Give me all you got
Work it for me, baby
Let me take my best shot

[Verse 1]
Meet the pretty boys
A line of bicycles for hire
Objects of desire
Working for the squire
You can look, but you'd better not touch

[Verse 2]
'Cause here come the pretty boys
They're gonna set your world on fire
Objects of desire
Preaching to the choir
They can talk, but they never say much

[Chorus]
Strike another pose
Try to feel the light
Hey, the camera loves you
Don't put up a fight

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
There go the pretty boys
A row of cottages for rent
For your main event
They're what the angels sent
You can look but you'd better not touch

[Chorus]
Look into my lens
Try to feel the light
Hey, the camera loves you
It's gonna be alright

[Verse 1]
Oh, here come the pretty boys
A line of bicycles for hire
Objects of desire
When they're working for the squire
You can look, but you'd better not touch

[Outro]
The pretty boys (You'd better not touch)
The pretty boys (But you'd better not touch)
The pretty boys

[Verse 1]
Hear me, women and wives
Hear me, husbands and lovers
What we do with our lives
Seems to matter to others
Some of them may follow
Roads that we run down
Chasing tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Many choices to make
Many chains to unravel
Every path that we take
Makes it harder to travel
Laughter turned to sorrow
Doesn't get me down
Chasing tomorrow

[Bridge]
When tomorrow comes around
You'll be looking at the future
So keep your feet upon the ground
And get ready to run

[Verse 3]
Now hear me, mothers and men
Hear me, sistеrs and brothers
Teach your children and thеn
They can pass it to others
Some of them may borrow
Tales you handed down
Chasing tomorrow

[Verse 1]
Hear me, women and wives
Hear me, husband and lovers
What we do with our lives
Seems to matter to others
Some of them may follow
Roads that we run down
Chasing tomorrow

[Outro]
Get ready to run
Chasing tomorrow
Get ready to run

[Verse 1]
Look out for Lavatory Lil
(Look out for Lavatory Lil)
You think that she's a winner when she's cookin' you your dinner
But she's really moving in for the kill
Lavatory Lil

[Verse 2]
Watch out for Lavatory Lil
(Watch out for Lavatory Lil)
She says it's hunky dory when she's tellin' you a story
But she really thinks you're makin' her ill
Lavatory Lil

[Bridge 1]
If you saw her coming at you
You could look the other way
But it isn't easy
When she rollin' in the hay

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
So much for Lavatory Lil
(So much for Lavatory Lil)
You think she's being friendly but she lookin' for a Bentley
And she'd rather go and swallow a pill
Lavatory Lil

[Bridge 2]
If you saw that she was comin'
You could get up off the track
But it isn't easy
When she hits you in the back

[Verse 4]
That's it for Lavatory Lil
(That's it for Lavatory Lil)
She's acting like a starlet but she lookin' like a harlot
As she's slowly headin' over the hill
Lavatory Lil
Lavatory Lil

[Verse 1]
I know there must be other ways of feelin' free
But this is what I wanna do, who I wanna be
Every time I try, I feel like I can fly
But I know that I could die trying

[Chorus]
I'm slidin', glidin' through the air
I can see my body through windows in my hair
I'm slidin', glidin' through the air

[Verse 2]
I know nobody's dancing here but us dragonflies
We're the only ones awake, we own the skies
Every time I try, I feel like I can fly
But I know that I could die trying

[Chorus]
I'm slidin', glidin' through the air
I can see my body through windows in my hair
I'm slidin', glidin' through the air

[Guitar Solo]

I can see my body through windows in my hair
I'm slidin', glidin' through the air
I can feel my body burn slidin' through the air

[Verse 1]
Must fix the fence by the acre plot
Two young foxes have been nosin' around
The lambs and the chickens won't feel safe
Until it's done

[Verse 2]
I must dig a drain by the carrot patch
The whole crop spoils if it gets too damp
And where will we be with an empty store
When winter comes?

[Chorus]
When winter comes and food is scarce
We'll warn our toes to stay indoors
When summer's gone, we'll fly away
And find the sun when winter comes

[Verse 3]
I must find the time to plant some trees
In thе meadow where thе river flows
In time to come, they'll make good shade
For some poor soul

[Chorus]
When winter comes and food is scarce
We'll warn our toes to stay indoors
When summer's gone, we're gonna fly away
And find the sun when winter comes

[Verse 1]
Must fix the fence by the acre plot
Two young foxes have been nosin' around
And the lambs and the chickens won't feel safe
Until it's done

[Chorus]
When winter comes and food is scarce
We'll warn our toes to stay indoors
When summer's gone, we're gonna fly away
And find the sun when winter comes

[Outro]
And find the sun when winter comes
It started with imagery. Visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity

Stars drawn around scars. A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later. Battleships sinking into the ocean, down, down, down. The tree swing in the woods of my childhood. Hushed tones of "let's run away" and never doing it. The sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine. A mirrored disco ball hovering above a dance floor. A whiskey bottle beckoning. Hands held through plastic. A single thread that, for better or for worse, ties you to your fate

Pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters. I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people I've never met, people I've known, or those I wish I hadn't. An exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that isn't his own, wondering how it all went so terribly, terribly wrong. An embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession. A seventeen-year-old standing on a porch, learning to apologize. Lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen High Line. My grandfather, Dean, landing at Guadalcanal in 1942. A misfit widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out

A tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around. Sometimes even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and diction become almost indiscernible. Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables. Fairytales and parables. Gossip and legend. Someone's secrets written in the sky for all to behold

In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory. I've told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder, and whimsy they deserve

Now it's up to you to pass them down
Was it a trap?
You fell inside right between the lines
And you tried so hard lately
So what's the deal?
You can't have what's beautifully adorned
It's perfect, all you wanted
But good things will come

Ivan come with me

You took too much you're torn apart deep inside the core
Well can't you move on slowly?
Oh can I help? Just let me help. Help you get back on your feet
Believe me I'll be back again for you my friend

Good things will come
Ivan come with me

[Intro]
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
What I got you got to give it to your mamma
What I got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop, continue
I realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser

[Chorus]
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

[Verse 2]
Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free, love me, say, "Hell, yes"
Low brow but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now
Bob Marley poet and a prophet
Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Bob Marley walkin' like he talk it
Goodness me can't you see I'm gonna cough it

[Chorus]
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Oh, oh yeah
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

[Backwards Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Lucky me swimming in my ability
Dancing down on life with agility
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility
My mom, I love her 'cause she love me
Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feelin' good my brother gonna hug me
Drink my juice young love chug-a-lug me
Ah, there's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is a never gonna wither
Come on, everybody, time to deliver

[Chorus]
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

[Verse 1]
What I got you got to give it to your mamma
What I got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop, continue
I realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser

[Chorus]
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now

[Verse]
You should get

You that you do you
I can't stand when motherfuckers say what I should do
You should, you should, you should, you should
Man, who should, who should, who should, who should?
On that new shit, new shit 

[?]
I'm so elusive

We ain't talking about a game, aye

Velah, Sеlah, Welah, and way high

Lyrics from snippet:

[Verse]
Tryna find a flame for my fire, can't bring it out
Smoke is caught in a fantasy
And now we are where we are right now
We found our way back to each other and turned it around
We'll build a hell of a family
That's where we are, where we are right now

[Chorus]
On that bullshit (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Miss me with the bullshit
On that bullshit

[...]

Oh, don't bring that back
You're just like me, you like to sleep around
I hate this feelin', just tryna get it right
Bare floors
And walls
Don't talk to them at all

Until now, the mound
Has been growing tall

My blanket is shaking
And the house is getting up

Bare floors
And walls
Don't look to them at all

Until now, the mound
Has been growing tall

My blanket is shaking
And the house is getting up

[Harmonica Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm not the same man I was a while ago
I've learned some new things, I hope that it shows
I'm free to give my love
But you're not the one I'm thinking of
So for me, the wheels are turning
Got to keep the homefires burning

[Verse 2]
I walk these borders in search of a line
Between young lovers who live separate lives
How long does this go on? I can hear another song
Late at night when I've been thinking
Substitute comes at me winking
Oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh

[Harmonica Solo]

[Outro]
I'm free to give my love
But you're not the one I'm thinking of
So for me, the wheels are turning
Gotta keep the homefires burning
I've got so much, yeah so much to say
I wonder if you feel the same
It's all a blur happened way too fast
But I'm glad that it's what we had

I'm lonely in my time alone
That's when I started to write this song
I move along baby fast and slow
I'm only hoping that you would know

How long will I be waiting for you?
My time is here for you as long you can stand it
Tell me truths I need to hear the good news
Start all over here we go again

I've got so much yeah so much to say
I wonder if you feel the same
It's all a blur happened way too fast
But I'm glad that it's what we had
After school today, you smiled and looked my way
I asked you out - the following night you said
"Gee, It'll be alright" oh-oh, Jenny Lee

I took you to a dance
Never thought I'd get the chance to hold you near
The way I do for you
To say your love is true oh-oh, Jenny Lee

Every night I dreamed about you
I just can't live without you
Needing you near - every day
Uh-oh, don't go away

If you do I'd cry, I would surely die
Nothing would be  the same for me
'Cause your the only one for me, uh-oh, Jenny Lee
Heavenly, heavenly
That's what you are, to me
A guiding light, in the night
For only me, to see

Your sweet lips, your lovely eyes
Hold the key to paradise
A guiding star, that's what you are
So heavenly, for only me

Is it your tender touch, I need you, oh so much
All the things you do, I'm so in love with you
Watch the way you smile, as we walk down the aisle
Heaven only knows what you mean to me

Heavenly, heavenly, that's what you are, to me
A guiding star, that's what you are
So heavenly, so heavenly
When I see, see my baby
When I see, see my girl
The way I feel, feel so good
When I see, see my girl

When she leaves, when she leaves me
When she leaves, when she leaves me
The way I feel, feel so low
When she leaves

[Verse 1]
There's a place for us
Somewhere, there's a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us somewhere
There is a time for us
I know there's a time and a place for us
Time together
With just a little bit of time to spare
A time to learn
And a time to care
Someday, yeah, someway
We'll find a new way of living
And we'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
There, there is a place for us
I know there's a time and a place for us
Hold my hand and we are halfway there
If you just hold on to my hand
I'll take you there
Someday
Someway
I'll take you somewhere

[Verse 1]
My kind of town, Detroit is
My kind of town, I tell ya, it is
My kind of people too
They're just like you
They smile at you and
Each time I roam Detroit, it's
Callin' me home, I tell ya, it is
My kind of town, and it won't let you down
This is my kind of town

[Verse 2]
My kind of town, Detroit is
My kind of town, don't you know it is
They've got that real crazy dress
It gives me a blast, ain't that a gas?
And each time I leave Detroit, it's
Tugging at my sleeve, I tell ya, it is
It's my kind of town, and it just won't let you down
This is my kind of town

[Verse 3]
Ooh, they've even got the swinging Miracles
I tell ya that that Smokey is just too lyricals
They've even got those real red-hot Four Tops
They got rid of those slick dos for some all-natural mops
My kind of town, it won't let you down
This is my, this is my kind of town

[Verse 1]
Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?

[Pre-Chorus]
But you see, it's not me, it’s not my family
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'

[Chorus]
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What’s in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

[Verse 2]
Another mother's brеakin'
Heart is takin' over
When thе violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the same old theme, since 1916
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'

[Chorus]
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What’s in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh-aah, ra-ra

[Instrumental Outro]

[Outro]
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh-aah, ra-ra

[Chorus]

Put me in a movie
Put me in a movie
Put me in a movie
Put me in a movie
I was always right
About the morning
Okay, I'm an old shoe

Danced above the blaze
Never stopped crawling
Over the black dunes

And I'm waiting for you
Waiting forever
Are you awake now too?

I'm always one
Without a warning
Old days re-appear

Lift away, past the gate
Desert keeps forming
Underneath the black moon

And I'm waiting for you
Waiting forever
Are you awake now too?
Lyrics from Snippet:

[Verse]
I like the way you talk when you've just woken up
And I like the way we can joke about offensive stuff
I like the way you give homeless men your mittens
When you're all out of spare change
And I like the way you think, I like your reasoning
Everyone thinks you're brilliant, you think you don't know anything
I like the way you care, you're nice when no one's there
God, I hope you never changе

[Chorus]
'Cause people lovе to talk
And people always want something from you
'Cause that's what people do
But I don't want a thing
I think you're astounding
And I don't care what anyone says or what anyone does
'Cause, boy, I like you
And I like you just because

[Verse 1]
I don't care to be bad
I prefer to think twice
All I know is it's quite a show
But it's still alright to be nice
Yankee toes and Eskimos
Can turn to frozen ice

[Chorus]
When the cold days come
And the old ways fade away
There'll be no more sun
And we'll wish that we had
Held on to the day
Seize the day

[Verse 2]
I don't mean to be wrong
I don't need to be right
I'm okay on a sunny day
When the world deserves to be bright
Dinosaurs and Santa Claus
Will stay indoors tonight

[Chorus]
When the cold days come
And the old ways fade away
Therе'll be no more sun
And we'll wish that wе had
Held on to the day
Seize the day
Seize the day

[Bridge]
I bless the day
When you came into my life
And I could finally roll back the blind
You helped me to realize
Love was the greatest prize
I only had to open my mind
Seize the day
Seize the day
Seize the day
Seize the day
Seize the day

[Verse 1]
I don't care to be bad
I prefer to think twice
All I know is it's quite a show
But it's still alright to be nice
Yankee toes and Eskimos
Can turn to frozen ice

[Chorus]
When the cold days come
And the old ways fade away
There'll be no more sun
And we'll wish that we had
Held on to the day
Seize the day
Seize the day

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
I had a out-of-body off a half a Molly
At the afterparty, had to grab a shawty (Gimme all of you, yeah)
She was in the corner all melancholy
We was both rollin' off the edamame
I felt the Devil on me, I felt the pressure on me
Yeah, I said it, call me up and met a zombie on (All of you, yeah)
First the brain releasеs dopamines
Then you lose all control of things
I'm an addict mysеlf, so I know a fiend
When I see one in Fashion Nova jeans
I'm in that euphoric psychedelic state
All I remember is an angelic face
I felt myself start to elevate to a place called

There's only two girls, feel like it's four of ya (Four of ya)
Before you take this journey, here's a tutorial
Take the Adderall with the Xans, that's the Morse Code
She took two and some coke, that's an Oreo
You don't remember shit (Yeah), that's how the story goes
Comin' down, you gon' feel horrible
Just make sure you drink a lot of water, though
Now you startin' to feel the side effects
Like you ain't had the right type of rest
When you grind your teeth and get out of breath
I suggest you take a seat, 'cause you high as hell
But don't trip, you fully functional
You just feelin' comfortable
Stop at Walgreens, get a Lunchable
You spent all your money on

Told these niggas door-to-door
Riding with the fucking—
Jason Derulo, oh!
Savage love
Trixy Cloth baby
If I woke up without ya
I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever
'Til I met you
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
You got a way of keeping me comin' back to back
I just found out, the only reason that you lovin' me
Was to get back at your ex-lover but before you leave
Usually I would never, would never even care
Baby I know she creepin', I feel it in the air
Every night and every day
I try to make you stay
But your
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angеl
But your savage love
When you kiss mе
I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that
Your savage love
Your savage love-love-love
Your savage love-love-love
You could use me
'Cause I still want that (Your savage)
Baby I hope that this ain't karma 'cause I get around
You wanna run it up, I wanna lock it down
Usually don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
You got a way of making me spend up all my cash
Every night and every day
I try to make you stay
But your
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel
But your savage love
When you kiss me
I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that
Your savage love
Your savage love-love-love
Your savage love-love-love
You could use me
'Cause I still want that your savage love
Your savage love-love-love
Your savage love-love-love
You could use me

Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel

[Intro]
Actual people that like, liked me in here, I don't know why. Like, I don't know why. I don't know. So, I hope you know it makes me very happy to—ooh—it makes me very happy to hear—see that you guys are here. I love all your faces. You look very pretty, you look very cute. Alright, alright, okay, here we go. We're really going for real, okay

[Chorus]
Mmm, all the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Verse 1]
Standing there, killing time
I can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight, mm
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Verse 2]
Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearin' fetters
Peter should know better
Your cover up is caving in
Man is such a fool, why are we saving him?
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
Sing it, woo (All the good girls go to Hell)
'Cause even God herself, mm, has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team, mm

[Post-Chorus]
And my Lucifer is lonely
There's nothing left to save now
And my god is gonna owe me
There's nothing left to save now

[Intro]
Woo, I love the energy in here

[Verse 1]
Mmm, mm-mm, da-da-da
I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyеs
Those ocean eyеs

[Verse 2]
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
I can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Chorus]
No fair, no fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes, those ocean eyes
(I'm scared) I'm scared
I've never, never, never, ooh (I've never fallen from quite this high)
Mmm (Fallin' into your ocean eyes)
Those ocean eyes

[Bridge]
(Seye naeco esoht)
(Seye naeco ruoy otni 'nillaf)
Ba-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-ba-ba-da-da-da (Hgih siht etiuq morf nellaf reven ev'I)
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da

[Chorus]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Intro]
Da-da-da-da-da, you must know this song

[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that sad—what? Hahahaha
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Uh, duh

[Post-Chorus]
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da
I'm the sad type, what?
Uh, mm
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the mеn I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't gеt enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
Ba-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da, uh
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da

[Intro]
Thank you, tee-hee-hee
Ah, this is a—an oldie, mm

[Verse 1]
Ba-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell

[Chorus]
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
Anymore

[Verse 2]
Da-na-na-na-na
Hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistakе
Only you know the way that I break, uh

[Chorus]
If teardrops could bе bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
Anymore

[Intro]
Oh, boy, we 'bout to bomb the next one. Oh, oh. Alright, hee-hee, you cute, heh-heh, heh-heh

[Chorus]
Mm, what do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know? Ba-ba-ba
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1]
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue, ahh
Bury a friend, try to wake up, ahh
Cannibal class, killing the son, ahh
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 2]
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now, wow
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no, mm

[Refrain]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue, ahh
Bury a friend, try to wake up, ahh
Cannibal class, killing the son, ahh
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go? Hee-hee

[Intro]
That's right, alright. Oh, we back. Okay, you ready for this next one? I'm ready. Y'all it is fall, it is November, it is going to be December soon and it's time for this one to come back

[Verse 1]
Mm-mmm
Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet
Quiet, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
You see the piece of paper
It could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it
Hmm-mm
And you don't have to keep it quiet
Hmm-mm

[Chorus]
And I know it makes you nervous
But I promisе you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kеpt inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play

[Verse 2]
Look up, out of your window
See snow, won't let it in though
Leave home and feel the wind blow
'Cause it's colder here inside in silence, mm-mm
And you don't have to keep it quiet

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play

[Intro]
Ooh, mm

[Verse 1]
Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine

[Verse 2]
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Verse 3]
Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You bеtter love me, 'causе you're just a clone

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Bridge]
Mine
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry
Psych, bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did

[Chorus]
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamor
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

[Intro]
Thank ya. Alright, um, the next one we're gonna play is-is very long and very sad. So, I don't know if you wanna, like, sit down on the floor, or some shit? I don't know if that's even possible, don't worry about it. Anyway, just relax, think about whatever you wanna think about. Um, just-just let this one be like one you don't worry about anything, yes? Okay.​

[Verse 1]
It's not true
Tell me I've been lied to
Crying isn't like you, ooh
What the hell did I do? Mm
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through, ooh
Mmm-mm-mm-mm

[Chorus]
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make mе laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I lovе you and I don't want to, ooh

[Verse 2]
Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry
Mmm-mm-mm-mm

[Chorus]
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

[Bridge]
The smile that you gave me
Even when you felt like dying
Do-do-do

[Outro]
We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothing you could do or say
I can't escape the way I love you
I don't want to, but I love you, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Intro]
Uh-uh-uh
Da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1]
Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies

[Pre-Chorus]
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

[Verse 2]
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny

[Pre-Chorus]
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bеllyache

[Verse 3]
Everything I do
The way I wеar my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But I lost my mind
I don't mind, sing it
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

[Chorus]
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake, mm
My V is for Vendetta
I thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache, a bellyache
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake, uh
My V is for Vendetta
I thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

[Intro]
Thank you. Okay, so I'ma do one more song and then I'm gonna go. But, um, I wanna thank you guys for coming and listening. Um, and, uh,  thank you so much to Jack White for having us and here being a boss, um, and-and inspiring a whole generation of people to do what they want. Um, and this place is so cool, it's like such an honor to get to be here and to do this. It's like the coolest thing ever. Do you see that? They're like making my voice onto a thing, like, that's crazy. Like, right now, it's crazy, heh. Um, so for this last one, um all I say—all I wanna say and all I ask is that just we all to just try to be, um, just try to be, um, just happy that we're alive and happy that we're breathing and that we're here and we're safe and, um, that's pretty much it. Just be—just for us to all be grateful that we're here right now on this Earth. Um, yeah, so thank you for having me. Let's do it. And thank you so much for giving me the energy you've been giving me

[Verse 1]
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Verse 2]
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer, call me back
And I'll call you when the party's over

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Bridge]
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Outro]
Thank you guys, thank you, I love you. And thank you to my brother, Finneas who's my best friend in the whole world

Sound like I'm hearing moaning, death bell ringing all in my head
Sound like I can hear moaning, death bell ringing all in my head
Yeah I know that I was gonna leave on a chariot but I didn't know
What kind of chariot gonna take me away from here

I want you to remember every living people, every living people bound to die
I want you to remember every living people, every living people bound to die

And your sittin' there so green
Believe me, man, I'm just the same as you
You want me to make a last cry and be satisfied
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do
Oh well, the band is rockin', everybody's feelin' alright alright
It's a Wednesday night, there sure is gonna be a fight

Somebody's gonna get their head kicked in tonight
Well the joint is jumpin', everybody's shoutin' for more
Well there's gonna be a pool of blood on the dance hall floor
'Cause somebody's gonna get their head kicked in tonight
We're gonna rip up the chairs and tear down the walls
Smash up the band and really have a ball

Will be everybody in a physical rage
And the whole dance hall will be a doggone mess

Oh Well now the band is rockin' and everybody's feelin' alright
It's a Wednesday night, there sure is gonna be a fight
'Cause somebody's gonna get their head kicked in tonight

Oh well now the band is rockin', everybody's shoutin' for more
Well there's gonna be a pool of blood on the dance hall floor
Oh yeah
Somebody's gonna get their head kicked in tonight

Words I speak
Live and breathe
Let us breathe, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Words I speak
Live and breathe
Lets us breathe, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Did you ever think I'd follow reason
Follow reason, can not see my face
Law of attraction, means I'm lost in passion
Means I got what I asked for, exactly what I asked for

Tell me from the start now - are you gonna leave me?
Tell me from the start now rather than deceive me
Every time you look at me I wonder if it's hard to be
A truth you'll find with someone else

Tell me from the start now - are you gonna leave me?
Tell me from the start now rather than deceive me
Every time you look at me I wondеr if it's hard to be
A truth you'll find with someone еlse

Tell me from the start now - are you gonna leave me?
Tell me from the start now rather than deceive me
Every time you look at me I wonder if it's hard to be
A truth you'll find with someone else
You know I can be found
Sitting home all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

Baby, if I made you mad
For something I might have said
Please, let's forget the past
The future looks bright ahead
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinking of

Don't stop thinking of me
Don't make me feel this way
C'mon over here and love me
You know what I want you to say
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Why should we be apart?
I really love you, baby, cross my heart
Let's walk up to the preacher
And let us say "I do"
Then you'll know you'll have me
And I'll know that I'll have you
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinking of

Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinking of
I'm so lonely and I'm so blue
Since you left me for somebody new
Don't you know I need you darling, I want your tender touch
I need you by my side, I want you so much

Well I need your tenderness
Don't you know that I want your sweet caress?
Don't you know I need you baby, want you here by my side
I want you near me, say you'll be my bride

Don't you know I'm so lonely and you know I'm so blue
Since you've gone I'm so sad and blue
Don't you know I need your tenderness?
Don't you know I want your sweet caress?

Don't you know I've been so lonely since you've been gone
Don't you know I miss your loving, don't you know you're the only one
Baby, if you got to rock
I got to be your rockin' horse
Baby, think you'd like to roll
Maybe your diggin' it more

They're shakin' the world
When it's time to crash
But when I get home tonight
I guess I got to shake myself

You need some love
You must have the blues
Ain't but the one thing
A good man can do

He do the shake
The rattlesnake shake
Man, do the shake
Yes, and jerk away the blues
Now, jerk it
Now, I know this guy
His name is mick
Now, he don't care when he ain't got no chick
He do the shake

The rattlesnake shake
Yes, he do the shake
And jerks away the blues
Now, jerk it
Well, shake it up, baby, now (Shake it up, baby)
Twist and shout (Twist and shout)
C'mon c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby, now (Come on baby)
Come on and work it on out (Work it on out)

Have you ever wanted to steal a kiss?
Have you ever wanted to try?
But you let her get you scared to death
You got so mad you could cry?

Well, I'm a sorry for you but I really don't know why
'Cause you never know what your missing until you try
Have you ever wanted to hold her tight
But you just could work up the nerve

But you waited 'til she had to go
You got just what you deserve?
Well, I'm a sorry for you but I really don't know why, umm
'Cause you never know what your missing 'til you try
Well, you never know what you're missing, 'til you try, 'til you try
Well, you nеver know what you're missing, that's no lie, that's no liе

Well, you better listen to what I say
If you want her to kiss you tonight
Go ahead and hold her close to you
And squeeze her with all of your might
You better give her the word before she leaves you high and dry
'Cause you never know what your missing 'til you try, 'til you try
I know a girl called Linda she's my hearts desire
This little girl called Linda sets my heart afire
Sets my heart afire

Uh-oh, can't you see you've got me in a whirl
It's as plain as it can be that you're my only girl
Please stay with me Linda don't ever leave me alone
'Cause I don't want to loose you I want you for my own
I want you for my own

Uh-oh, can't you see, you've got me in a whirl
It's as plain as it can be that you're my only girl

Please stay with me Linda, don't ever leave me alone
'Cause I don't want to lose you, I want you for my own
I want you for my own
You're a mean mistreatin' mama, you mistreat me all the time
You're a mean mistreatin' mama, you mistreat me all the time
I tried to tell you how much I loved you
But you don't pay that no mind

You're a mean mistreatin' mama, and you don't mean me no good
You're a mean mistreatin' mama, and you don't mean me no good
I don't blame you baby, I'd beat her the same way if I could

You remember, baby, when I knocked upon your door
You had the nerve to tell me that you didn't want me no more
Remember, baby, when I knocked upon your door
You had the nerve to tell me - that you didn't want me no more, oh, yeah

Ain't it lonesome, sleeping all by yourself
When the woman you've been lovin' is in love with someone else
Ain't it lonesome, baby, sleepin' by yourself
When the woman you've been lovin' - is in love with someone else

You're a mean mistreatin' mama, you mistreat me all the time
You're a mean mistreatin' mama, you mistreat me all the time, oh yeah
I tried to tell you how much I loved you
But you don't pay that no mind
Let's go

[Verse: Travis Scott]
I can see the future is lookin' like we level through the sky
I can't wait to live in glory and eternal lastin' life
Won't you take the wheel? I'll recline and I'll sit still
Might as well turn up now, he gon' pop up unannounced
To the trumpets, do you like the way it sounds?

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
I cannot take another ounce (Ah)
Runnin' through the clouds
I can hear my thoughts so loud
I can hear their drums so loud
Do you like the way it sounds?
Feel like I've been gone for a while
But there ain't no turnin' back now
People washed away in droves
Those drums, not thosе drugs
Do you like the way it sounds?

[Verse 1]
She had a couple different daddies
Could never make her mama happy
And her skinny little sister
Got all the attention
So she slept with half the town
And when the gossip got around
That was she fast, she blamed her past

[Chorus]
We've all got our issues, a lotta life we gotta live through
A dozen different reasons to fall apart
So don't start with all that "poor me"
'Cause everybody's got a story that'll break your heart

[Verse 2]
You blame the drinkin' on your childhood
You blame thе school 'cause you don't talk good
You blame the drivе-thru for the weight gain
Your hot temper on your last name
You blame for your ex for your divorce
Blame the judge for the child support that you've gotta pay
And you'd blame God if you prayed

[Chorus]
So, yeah, we've all got our issues, all the shit we gotta get through
A dozen different reasons to fall apart
So don't you start with all that "poor me"
'Cause everybody's got a story that'll break your heart

[Bridge]
I could sit and talk for days about
What the world has put me through
But when you point a finger
There's three more pointing back at you

[Chorus]
We've all got our issues, all the shit we gotta get through
A dozen different reasons I could fall apart
So I don't wanna hear that "poor me"
'Cause everybody's got a story
And
