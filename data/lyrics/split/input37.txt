yself

[Hook]
Baby, this is my life
Young Thug balling
Stack the money up, and it spend all at the mall and
Baby, this is my life
The whole crew eating
Bricks came Monday and they gone by the weekend
Baby, this is my life
I done wrote a lot of tracks
They be like "Appreciate you, Young Thug"
And every time we about to leave
They be like "Come back to my club"
I had a show up in LA, them niggas swore I was the plug
I'm sipping on some syrup, man I think that I'm in love

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
And they be like "Thug, where the fuck you go?"
I am way up here
Big fat racks in front of me like a chauffeur
And my son scared of me, he say "The mink look like a bear"
So that's why everywhere I go, women just look and stare
But my car is not rare
Meaning I pay double and the ring cost a couple
And I am not weak, but the Ferrari doesn't struggle
And I guess I'm a baller, because the Feds say I double
And I am such a winner, oops, my fault, I'm still winning
And you such a beginner, oops, my fault, you still beginning
And I get money on my own, while you steady depending
Believe me, I am not kidding

[Hook]
Baby, this is my life
Young Thug balling
Stack the money up, and it spend all at the mall and
Baby, this is my life
The whole crew eating
Bricks came Monday and they gone by the weekend
Baby, this is my life
I done wrote a lot of tracks
They be like "Appreciate you, Young Thug"
And every time we about to leave
They be like "Come back to my club"
I had a show up in LA, them niggas swore I was the plug
I'm sipping on some syrup, man I think that I'm in love

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I stack 50s and 100s because I like them
They don't want to lick him no more, they trying to bite him
I'm 18, day grown women, they trying to mic him
Plus the fellas mad, they angry, they think they fright him
Plus I made them think that I'm broke, I had to psych them
I went and caught the Super Bowl ring, I tried to light them
I blew the bubble kush in their face, I tried to kite them
When I left the club with they bitch, I goodnight them

[Hook]
Baby, this is my life
Young Thug balling
Stack the money up, and it spend all at the mall and
Baby, this is my life
The whole crew eating
Bricks came Monday and they gone by the weekend
Baby, this is my life

[Intro: Big Sean]
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, I love Detroit
I get It, I get it, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
It's no young'n that's lyrical, uncomparable
Mine's is historical, they's is hysterical
Man my bank account is so numerical
I guess because I save like miracles
Oh, they tend to un-lie me, I been paid
Mr. West just signed me
They hoes love my money what I care if they like me
They probably rather have my green poke like palm trees
Ooh yeah, here in-come income
However I end up it'll be with my ends up
Isn't it ironic that the models on the posters that I used to pin up
Is the ones I pin up?
They looking at a nigga like oh my Jesus
I been a man, bitch, ever since I's a foetus
You bound to go broke trying to match what my fee is
It's evident and clear as a cheer to see that

[Hook]
I get money, money I got
I get It, I get It, yeah, yeah
I Love Detroit
I get it, I get it

[Outro: Big Sean]

Cole
Cole world
Yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wadn't nuttin' like that
Man, it wadn't nuttin' like that

[Verse 1]
First time, she was in my math class (Uh-huh)
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad, so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it, uh
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school, ‘cause when I seen
Them thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up, as time goes by
Attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, "You ever had sex before?"
Damn…

[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 2]
I wrote back and said
"Of course I had sex before," knowin' I was frontin'
I said, "I'm like a pro, baby," knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one, but
She don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
"Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'."
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up, I wrote back like
"Yeah, baby, sound like a plan."
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin
Fuck…

[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 3]
Yeah, you know that feelin' when you know
You finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck wit'
And most of all I'm prayin', "God, don't let me bust quick"
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go, right?
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin' and her face start blushin'
And a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbin'
On me, ooh girl, don't stop, it's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
"I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—"

[Chorus]
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Refrain]
Do you wanna, do you wanna be?
Do you wanna, do you wanna be?
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, free?
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy?
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy?
Do you wanna be, happy?
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be happy?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free?

[Verse]
Free from pain, free from scars
Free to sing, free from bars
Free my dawgs, you're free to go
Block is hot, the streets is cold
Free to love, to each his own
Free from bills, free from pills
You roll it loud, the speakers blow
Life get hard, you ease your soul
It cleanse ya mind, learn to fly
Then reach the stars, you take the time
To look behind and say, "Look where I came
Look how far I done came"
They say that dreams come true
And when they do, that there's a beautiful thing

[Refrain]
Now do you wanna, do you wanna be happy?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be free?
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be?

[Verse]
I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I tried so not to give in
I said to myself, 'this affair never will go so well'
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well
I've got you under my skin

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'd sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear

[Chorus 1]
"Don't you know little fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality"
But each time that I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I would sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear

[Chorus 2]
"Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?
Why not use your mentality? Step up, wake up to reality"
But each time I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
Yes, I've got you, under my skin

[Verse 1]
Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah, can I get a glimpse?

[Hook 1]
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
(What's the value of a thing?) Guess not!
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Bridge]
Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shit ain't always good as it seems
But tell me till you get it how could you know?
How could you know? How could you know?

[Verse 2]
Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gon' circle round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key my nigga
Listen up I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let 'em kill your dream
It'll haunt you nigga, haunt you

[Hook 2]
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like—
Do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things? (What's the value of a thing?)
Guess not!
Last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
(You know what the fuck it is nigga, run that shit!)
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Outro]
Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command

La la la
La la la la la
La la la (Yeah)
La la la la la (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
I grew up, a fucking screw up, tie my shoe up
Wish they was newer, damn, need something newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I wasn't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga, and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, 'cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' 'bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now, I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I'm tryna stay alive, in the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I? (La la la)
Ayy, who am I? (La la la la la, yeah)

[Chorus]
Things change, rearrange and so do I
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall, just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

[Verse 2]
I always did shit the hard way
My nigga 

[inaudible] slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller with more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a
Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch and he gon' get it right back
I peeped game, got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard, pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though
I told her, "Hello", and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked, "What a nigga gotta do to get that?
Put me on," he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing, his demeanor said more
He told me, "Nigga, you know how you sound right now?
If you wasn't my mans, I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be, that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You 'bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't want us, why the fuck they never wore rubbers?"
I felt ashamed to have ever complained
About my lack of gear and thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me and show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive
Ayy, who am I?

[Chorus]
Things change, rearrange and so do I (Ayy, who am I?)
It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie (Who am I?)
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall, just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

[Outro]
I never felt better

[Produced by J. Cole & Vinylz]

[Chorus]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 1]
Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest
A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest
I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants
I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun
In fact I just might need two, cause niggas say they the one
And I got something to prove
Forgive me, Lord, here they come, BLAOOW

[Chorus]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Verse 2]
My inhibition's fighting my intuition
Premature premonition, showing me the demolition
Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time
Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing
You want the truth well come and listen
I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
As fate passes you by, half of you try
The other half of you fried, too high to actually fly
One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be
A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me
Keep it true like me, Cole you might be
Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T
Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee
Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee
Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee
Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me!
BLAOOOW!

[Chorus]
Nigga why you actin' like a ho?
Know that I'ma ride for ya, either way it go
Tell me, girl why you be stressin' me for time?
When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb?
Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch?
If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich?
Come here baby why you always insecure?
Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure

[Bridge]
(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
(Who's the king?)
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
(Who's the king?)
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

[Verse 3]
Listen...
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each other's flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock 'n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?

[Outro]
We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
In reality he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
'Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved

[Verse 1: J. Cole & TS, J Cole]
Roll up and smoke my sins away
I'd like to go to St. Tropez
Maybe I'll go, maybe I'll stay (Maybe I'll stay)
She asked me if I'm scared to fly
To tell the truth, I'm terrified
I never been that high before
Very bad reason not to go
Terrible reason not to go

[Hook: J. Cole & TS]
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
Show him the way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood
He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid
He's on his way to Hollywood

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Ayy, from the door I showed you my scars
And I told you girl, "I won't lie-ie-ie"
If we at war, then this is a war
That I can't afford, no I, I, I
I wanted more but that was before
Lord knows I'm torn, so I–I cry (No I, I, I)
From the corner of my eye, baby
It's been hard for me to smile-ile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile-ile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile-ile
Lately, it's been hard for me to smile

[Interlude: TS & Esther Phillips]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home
If you won't take me in your home

He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid

He's on his way, he's 'bout to get paid

[Verse 1]
You wanna know just where I'm at? Well, let me tell you 'bout it
I put my city on the map, but let me tell you 'bout it
They tryna say I can't come back, ayy, let me tell you 'bout it
Man, fuck them niggas, I come back, ayy, let me tell you 'bout it
I wanna tell you 'bout it: hands up, everybody run
Cole outside and he say he got a gun
Niggas like, "Man, that's what everybody said"
Go and pop the trunk and now everybody dead
Everybody scared of the nigga, aware that the nigga is better
All my bitches the pick of the litter, never bitter
Niggas is fake, they anime
Me I never hate, get cake like Anna Mae, woah
Eat the cake bitch, eat the damn cake, uh
Fuck good, nigga, we demand great
Order Domino's and she take off all her clothes
Nigga you know how it goes, make the pizza man wait

Even Hov tried to keep it and I leaked the damn tape, uh
Rest in peace any nigga want beef
Secret service couldn't keep the man safe

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, to the window, to the wall (To the wall)
My nigga ride when I call (I call)
Got bitches all in my mind (My mind)

Get off my dick, woah

[Bridge]
Man, fuck them niggas, I come home and I don't tell nobody
They gettin' temporary dough and I don't tell nobody
Lord, will you tell me if I changed? I won't tell nobody
I wanna go back to Jermaine, and I won't tell nobody

[Interlude]
This is the part that the thugs skip!

[Verse 2]
Young nigga never had love
You know, foot massage, back rub shit
Blowin' bubbles in the bathtub shit
That is until I met you
Together we done watch years go by
Seen a river of your tears go by
Got me thinkin' 'bout some kids, still I
Tell them hoes come through, the break up
Get to know somebody and you really learn a lot about 'em
Won’t be long before you start to doubt 'em
Tell yourself you better off without 'em
Then in time you will find can't walk without 'em
Can't talk without 'em, can't breathe without 'em
Came here together, you can't leave without 'em
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em
On your Amerie, it's just 1 Thing about 'em
It's called love, niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more, no more
It's called love, niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more
(Nigga, I don't sing about this shit no more)
But every nigga in the club singin'

[Pre-Chorus]
To the window, to the wall (To the wall)
My nigga ride when I call (I call)
Got bitches all in my mind (My mind)
Fuck nigga blockin' my shine (My shine)
I know the reason you feel the way
I know just who you wan' be
So everyday I thank the man upstairs
That I ain't you and you ain't me

[Bridge]
Get off my dick
But every nigga in the club singin'
Singin' this song, yeah
Got all the bitches in the club singin'
Singin' this song, yeah
And all they mamas let their kids sing it
Sing this song, yeah
The baby mamas and the mistresses
This song, yeah, song, yeah
Song, yeah, song-song, yeah

[Verse 3]
The make up
This shit is retarded, goddamn
Why every rich black nigga gotta be famous?
Why every broke black nigga gotta be brainless?
Uh, that's a stereotype
Driven by some people up in Aerial Heights
Here's a scenario:
Young Cole pockets is fat like Lil Terrio
Dreamville, give us a year we'll be on every show
Yeah, fuck nigga, I'm very sure, heh
Fuck the rest, I'm the best nigga out
When I'm back home, I'm the best in the South
When I'm in L.A., I'm the best in the West
You contest? You can test, I'ma stretch niggas out
Ooh, I'ma stretch niggas out
That go for all y'all if I left niggas out
This shit for everybody on my testicles
Please make sure you put the rest in your mouth, ho

[Verse 1]
First things first: rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King would'a been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus 1]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 2]
No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Not Trina but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, "Hey, what's good?
Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good"
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it"
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus 1]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 3]
I want a real love, dark-skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt, 'fore she leave
"I'ma need my shirt back" (Nigga, you know how it go)

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus 1]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Interlude: George W. Bush]
There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once… shame on… shame on you. Fool me—can't get fooled again.

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop bop bop)
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop bop bop)

[Verse 4]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch prolly couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song

[Chorus 2]
She shallow but the pussy deep, she shallow
She shallow
She shallow but the pussy deep, she shallow (Yeah, ayy)
She shallow
She shallow but the pussy deep, she shallow
She shallow
She shallow but the pussy deep, she shallow
She shallow

[Chorus 1]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Produced by Phonix Beats & J. Cole]

[Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

[Verse 1]
And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes two now
Oh what do I do now?
'Cause if we ever got together
I'd have to be them niggas step-pops forever
And well that ain't my thing 'cause I
I ain't even got my own
And I ain't really got no home
No place to put these things I own
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the games you used to play
And I thought about that little kid
And I thought about the things we did
I always thought that we would be together
I always knew that we would be together
But I don't wanna wait forever
I don't wanna wait forever

[Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

[Bridge 1]
Hello? Hell-hello? Hello?
Shit seem so sad when you look back (Hello?)
Shit seem so sad when you look back (Hello?)
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Everything's so sad when you look back

[Verse 2]
On the rebound like a book back
On the rebound like a put back
Don't just sit back, bitch get on it
Time fly by way too quick, don't it?
Reflection bring regrets don't it?
Rejection makes you defensive
So you protect your pride with your reflexes
But life is a game with no reset on the end

[Bridge 2]
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It's all good, ay
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
It ain't no lookin' back, no, no, no, no
Heh, it's all good

[Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello

[Outro]
And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes two now
Oh what do I do now?

[Intro]
Oh, right, oh
Oh, why, na-da-da-da

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Verse 1]
This is my canvas (Yeah, my canvas)
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you 'cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish? I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show, I love her just like I love you, and
I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together
I love you mama

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Post-Chorus]
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh, I

[Verse 2]
Another day, another rhyme, ho
Another day, another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right, I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you, nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's an AP, nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me, nigga— huh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes, so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, "Thanks for the view," waiting on thanks from a few
'Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cold as your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard, but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like "boing!" on a big ass Boeing, and getting head like a coin toss, too easy

[Chorus]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Post-Chorus]
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, you believe in me
E-e-eee, e-e, apparently
You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I

[Intro]
Huh, love yours
Huh, love yours
No such thing

[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

[Post-Chorus]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleepin' on your level
'Cause it's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Let me explain, yeah

[Verse 1]
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words and listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and know sometimes we had less
Compared to some my niggas down the block, man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairy tale, no once upon a time
But I be goddamned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me, Momma please, why you be drinkin' all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
'Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches, listen, this is what you'll find
The good news is, nigga, you came a long way
The bad news is, nigga, you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Ha)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Think being broke was better)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
(Think being broke was better, yeah) No such thing, no such thing

[Verse 2]
For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love?
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I ask for strength from the Lord (Man) up above
'Cause I been strong so far, but I can feel my grip loosenin'
Quick, do somethin' before you lose it for good, get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of livin' with demons 'cause they always invitin' more
Think being broke was better, now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there livin' in debt
Cashin' minimal checks, turn on the TV, see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely, and as a nigga who was once in your shoes
Livin' with nothin' to lose, I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy 'til you love yours

[Chorus]
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing, no such thing

[Post-Chorus]
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived

[Intro]
1, 2, 3, 4
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
And wherever we go
And whatever we do
And whatever we see
And whoever we be
It don't matter, it don't matter
I don't mind 'cause you don't matter
I don't mind 'cause I don't matter
(And don't shit matter) You'll see in the end

[Verse]
I've got a feeling that there's somethin' more
Something that holds us together
Something that holds us together
The strangest feeling but I can't be sure
Something that's old as forever
Something that's old as forever
Love, love, love, love

[Chorus]
And wherever we go
And whatever we do
And whatever we see
And whoever we be
It don't matter, ahh, it don't matter
I don't mind 'cause you don't matter, ay
I don't mind 'cause I don't matter
(And don't shit matter) You'll see in the end, ahh!

[Verse 1]
I lived my life like a masochist
Hearing my father say, "Told you so, told you so
Why can't you be like the other girls?"
I said, "Oh no, that's not me
And I don't think that it'll ever be"
Thought I belonged to a different tribe
Walking alone, never satisfied, satisfied
Tried to fit in, but it wasn't me
I said, "Oh no, I want more
That's not what I'm looking for"

[Chorus]
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness, somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth
Of my rebel heart

[Verse 2]
I spent some time as a narcissist
Hearing the others say, "Look at you, look at you!"
Trying to be so provocative
I said, "Oh yeah, that was me"
All the things I did just to be seen
Outgrown my past and I've shed my skin
Letting it go and I'll start again, start again
Never look back, it's a waste of time
I said, "Oh yeah, this is me
And I'm right here where I wanna be"
I said, "Hell yeah, this is me
Right where I'm supposed to be"

[Chorus]
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness, somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in my rebel heart
So I took the road less traveled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness, somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth
Of my rebel heart

[Outro]
In my Rebel Heart
In my Rebel Heart

[Verse 1]
In a world that's changing
I'm a stranger, in a strange land
There's a contradiction
And I'm stuck here in between
Life is like a desert
An oasis to confuse me
So I walk this razor's edge
Will I stand or will I fall?

[Pre-Chorus]
Turn a blind eye
Tried to pretend that nothing is what it seems
Torn between the impulse to stay or
Running away from all this madness

[Chorus]
Who am I to decide what should be done?
If this is the end, then let it come
Let it come, let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me

[Verse 2]
All of my illusions
Could be shattered in a second
You can thread a needle
With a teardrop from my eyes
It's a cruel injustice
To be witness to the things I see
Looking for the answer
When it's right in front of me

[Pre-Chorus]
From the Tower of Babylon
Where nothing is what it seems
Gonna watch the sun going down
I'm not gonna run from all this sadness

[Chorus]
Who am I to decide what should be done?
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come, let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me
Who am I to decide what should be done?
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come, let it rain
Rain all over me
Like the tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me, over me
Let it wash all over me

[Hook]
You need to find yourself and let it show
You'll forget it when you let it go
I'll never let you leave daddy
Cause there's some things you need to see daddy
So everybody give it up for my, baby
Cause we gon' live it up til our days is gone
Give it up for my, baby
Come on, come on

[Bridge]
And we might touch the surface, babe
Cause love is kind to those who grow
Just tell'em you don't know who I be
Yeah, I got a couple tricks up my sleeve
So roll'em up, all them haters are bored of us
I'm waiting for ya, I can't afford the love
Can't you see, you ain't live in a fantasy world, yeah
Can't ya keep up?
Sippin margarita
Call me Señorita
Dancing in my Lita's
Looking like Vita
Coco, I'm sweeter
You can't really beat her
Follow me and I'll lead ya
(Don't do anything)

[Verse 1]
Who you better than?
We go farther than neverland
Taking off and I never land
Yellow bitches and yellow sand
Remy, weed and stiletto hands
Pop the pussy like metal cans
Fur coat and I'm shedding man
Ha, steez
Cause I see the light
Give you what you need tonight
We don't fuck with leave behinds
Simple plans, we just lead behind
Don't make me count to six, give you "kitten's" timeouts and shit
Keep your weapon and mouth your bitch
Run for it, now my mouth is sick
Tell me "Doja, that hurts no fair"
See my team we just circle squares
Bad bitches with purple hair, with attitudes that no man could bear
Uh oh, look at what the Cat dragged in
Keep them rats out my cat mansion
Fuck all your opinions, I dont give them atten-ti-on
Lights out at the benihana, sugar fish and that sushi roll
Cool ya chick, keep ya uzi home
Uzi home
Double cup, po' it in
Sweat it out and then sew it in
Beamer benz and polish friends
Yoo, but mirror who is the coldest bitch?
Mirror who be the coldest bitch?
Mirror who is the coldest bitch?
Mirror who be the coldest bitch?

[Verse 1]
Impossible Germany
Unlikely Japan
Wherever we go
Wherever we land

[Chorus]
I can't say what this means to me
I don't begin to understand
I know you're not listening
Impossible Germany
Unlikely Japan

[Verse 2]
Handheld recorders monotone
Your peach-colored pay phone
Connected to you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I don't know why she talks so tough
A roller skate would suggest her enough

[Chorus, 2x]

[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm just a kid
Maybe I just don't fit in
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready to go now
I don't wanna go to school
But I don't get to make the rules
Too early, too early, too early, too early in the morning

[Chorus]
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Has to do something they don't want to do
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Has to do something, oh, why is that true?

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm not so big
Maybe I just don't fit in
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready for more now
And I don't wanna go to bed
There's so much going on in my head
Not tired, not tired, not tired, not tired right now

[Chorus]
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Has to do something they don't want to do
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Has to do something, oh, why is that true?

[Post-Chorus]
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Has to do something, let's have some fun

[Bridge]
(Na, na, na, na-na)
(Na-na-na-na-na, na-na)
(Na, na, na, na-na)
(Na-na-na-na-na, na-na)
(Na, na, na, na-na)

[Outro]
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everyone, somebody, anyone
Has to grow up, let's have some fun

[Verse 1]
I've been burned
And with both feet on the ground
I've learned
That it's painful coming down

[Chorus]
There's no use running away
And there's no time left to say
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusing
No time left and I know I'm losing

[Verse 2]
Flashed
And I feel like I'm falling down
Crashed
And my ears can't hear a sound

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Now I'm finding out that it's so confusing
No time left and I know I'm losing

[Verse 3]
Burned
And with both feet on the ground
I've learned
That it's painful coming down

[Chorus]
I watch the clock a lot
To see where I'm at in the plot
It's like a movie starring me
It's all so moving to me

And I don't want to leave
This walking dream
It's up to you to get me home
I won't go it alone

In days of olden, silence was golden
I dreamed of you
Hair on my pillow like a weeping willow
Cool breeze flows through

There will be no failure
And I won't be the last
Prima donna stuck in a trailer
Blasting Fonda on the news

In days of olden silence was golden
I dreamed of you
Hair on my pillow like a weeping willow
Cool breeze flows through
Cross your fingers behind your back
Squeeze mine until they crack
I must have known you were just promising
Promising, promising

Toothy smile, girly style
In the backyard, all the while
I must have known you were just promising
Promising, promising

I promise you and you promise me
Not to admit defeat
I promise, you promise me

So comforting, wear your ring
Over my head, around my finger
I must have known you were just promising
Promising, promising

I promise you and you promise me
Not to admit defeat
I promise, you promise me
Won't you let me walk you home from school?
Won't you let me meet you at the pool?
Maybe Friday, I can
Get tickets for the dance
And I'll take you

Won't you tell your dad, "Get off my back?"
Tell him what we said about "Paint It, Black"
Rock and roll is here to stay
Come inside where it's okay
And I'll shake you

Won't you tell me what you're thinking of?
Would you be an outlaw for my love?
If it's so, well, let me know
If it's over, well, I can go
I won't make you
Don't you honey me, honey bee
A good time I'll set you free
Don't be too nice, too nice to me
I've been stung and I've grown mean

Honestly, I know what you want
And I can't satisfy you
Honestly, it hurts me too
And I don't wanna ever make you blue
Make you blue
I don't wanna make you blue

Don't sit next to me in a tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
Who's that bouncing on your knee?
Could it be my baby bumble bee?
Who's that bouncing on your knee?
Give me back my baby bumble bee

Honestly, I know what you need
I just wanna be true
I love you, too
And I can always make you blue
Make you blue
I don't wanna make you blue
I don't wanna make you blue
I don't wanna make you blue
Gonna take a meteor shower
Lay me out on the lawn
With one detective's daughter
Nth power, shine on

And maybe my verses
Ain't that free
Cause there'll be no more
Poetry

Taurus is a great big bull
He hid my heart out in the woods
The heavens move so slow
But I'm quick and good

And you don't have to be poor
To hang with me
Cause there'll be no more
Poetry

There's a God-shaped hole
Bleeding love up above
And in my heart full of soul
I just can't seem to get enough
And you don't have to be poor
To hang with me
Cause there'll be no more
Poetry

Cut it up, cut it up
Fill it up, fill it up

And you don't have to see me
To be free
Cause there'll be no more
Poetry

[Verse 1]
You could buy me diamonds, you could buy me pearls
Take me on a cruise around the world
(Baby, you know I'm worth it)
Dinner lit by candles, run my bubble bath
Make love tenderly to last and last
(Baby, you know I'm worth it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna please, wanna keep, wanna treat your woman right
Not just dough, but to show that you know she is worth your time
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first
She will and she can find a man who knows her worth
Mm-mmm

[Chorus]
'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her (When he sees her)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't 'fraid to please her (Please her)
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first (First)
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth (A woman's worth)

[Post-Chorus]
Mm-hm, mm-hmm
Mm-hm, mm-hmm
Mm-hm, mm-hmm
Mm (Uh, hold up)

[Verse 2]
If you treat me fairly, I'll give you all my goods
Treat you like a real woman should
(Baby, I know you're worth it)
If you never play me, promise not to bluff
I'll hold you down when shit gets rough
('Cause baby, I know you're worth it)

[Pre-Chorus]
She walks the mile, makes you smile, all the while being true
Don't take for granted the passions that she has for you
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first
She will and she can find a man who knows her worth
Ohh

[Chorus]
'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her (When he sees her)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't 'fraid to please her (Please me)
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first (First, baby)
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth

[Bridge]
No need to read between the lines spelled out for you (Spelled out for you)
Just hear this song 'cause you can't go wrong when you value (Better value)
A woman's (Sing it) woman's, woman's, woman's worth
Yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her (When he sees her)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't 'fraid to please her (Please me)
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first (First, baby)
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth (A woman's worth)
'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her (Nothing like a woman's worth)
And a real woman knows a real man ain't 'fraid to please her (Ooh-ooh)
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first (Comes first)
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth (Woman's worth)

[Outro]
Mm-hm, mm-hmm (Do-ooh)
Mm-hm, mm-hmm (Sibba-dibba, do-do)
Mm-hm, mm-hmm (Do-do-do-di-di-di-di)
Mm-hm, mm-hmm (Ooh)
Mm-hm, mm-hmm (Cherish that woman)
Mm-hm, mm-hmm (It better be good for that woman)
Mm-hm, mm-hmm (Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
Mm-hm, mm-hmm (Ooh, yeah)

Y'all fools, y'all can't fool me

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
This the shit that defines me

Even if they did
I'd settle for two billion, smilin'
Move lowkey, no sirens
Grew up around keys and violence
Was taught to stay silent
Now silence

[Chorus: Chloe Angelides & (Pitbull)]
I wanna go somewhere exotic

You can't save me, babe, it's too late
I'm looking for a freak, not a soulmate
Sexy beaches, hotels, mirrors on the roof
Making more fun, ain't that the truth
Lose our morals and our minds
At the same damn time
And bring your girlfriend
Cause she's so damn fine

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull & (Chloe Angelides)]
And I know what they want
And I know what they need
I just look'em in the eyes

[Chorus: Jason Derulo & (Pitbull)]
Do you wanna ride, baby? (Mr. Worldwide)
'Cause I don't mind driving you crazy (Jason Derulo)
I heard you like to go fast, girl (Juicy J)
'Cause no, I don't run out of gas, girl (Yes, sir)
So would you let me pull up to your bumper
In my new black car? (Ya)
Girl, rev up your engine, I'll push start your ignition
Pull up to your bumper
In my new black car
Girl, rev up your engine, I'll push start your ignition
And let's ride, baby
While I drive, you crazy
Let's ride, baby
While I drive, you crazy

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Catch me on New Year's Eve, on FOX
Bringing that Miami Heat, white hot
She's like "Papi, why you work so hard", why not?
That's not what she says when I'm working that box
Now ride, baby, forget about the past and ride, baby
Once you give it up, you'll be mine, baby
Not on the first night, don't lie, baby
Ride, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
'Cause girl, I like it fast, you like it slow
Where I'm gonna take you, you've never been before
Hit the gas until we lose control
You in for a wild ride, a wild ride, baby

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Do you wanna ride, baby?
'Cause I don't mind driving you crazy
I heard you like to go fast, girl
'Cause no, I don't run out of gas, girl
So would you let me pull up to your bumper
In my new black car?
Girl, rev up your engine, I'll push start your ignition
Pull up to your bumper
In my new black car?
Girl, rev up your engine, I'll push start your ignition
And let's ride, baby
While I drive, you crazy
Let's ride, baby
While I drive, you crazy

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Uh, huh
Yeah, Juicy J
Ride it like a first class seat on a plane
Baby, go insane, make me remember your name
As we go up and down, roller coaster ride
Spread it open, let me go inside
Let me slide in between and park my stretch limousine
When I slap that ass, you soaking wet
Tonight's one night you won't forget
We tryna get a bone, let's play fetch, baby
I'm on deck like an old cassette
When I'm through, you gon' want you a souvenir
Stuff so good, make you shed a tear
With a smile on your face from ear-to-ear
And a tattoo that say "Juicy J was here"

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
'Cause girl, I like it fast, you like it slow
Where I'm gonna take you, you've never been before
Hit the gas until we lose control
You in for a wild ride, a wild ride, baby

[Verse 1]
Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin' and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now, I'm takin' my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was '06
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, "Yes, I suppose"

[Pre-Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

[Chorus]
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it, then it's gone
While we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride out wit' you, still, the night is young
And we keep goin', we go (We go, we go)
We wake back up and do it all again (And we know, we know)
Said, "Fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end"
When all is said and done, look what we've become (Oh, we go)
I just want you to know that I did it for you

[Verse 2]
I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask? Or am I just buggin'?
'Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties broken before me
Niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me
Yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I'll pop a pill and remember
The look in his eyes the last day he saw me

[Pre-Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

[Chorus]
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it, then it's gone
While we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride out wit' you, still, the night is young
And we keep goin', we go (We go, we go)
We wake back up and do it all again (And we know, we know)
Said, "Fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end"
When all is said and done, look what we've become (Oh, we go)
I just want you to know that I did it for you

[Verse 3]
Lemme make this clear: I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college just to say, "We did it"
My child with Aaron woulda been sixteen any minute
So in some ways, I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel lookin' over him
And I know Jelani will always love me and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writin', this is The Pinkprint

[Outro]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart

[Chorus]
Even though I said I didn’t love you (Love you, love you)
I lied, I lied
Even though I said I didn’t need you
I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said, "Don’t touch me" (Touch me, touch me)
I lied, I lied

[Verse 1]
I can’t fall for you, can’t give my all to you
Can’t let you think that I'ma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me, you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said, "Let’s see"
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fuckin' proof
'Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose?
You just a heartbreaker, won’t let you break mine
'Cause I’ll be smashin' windows and cuttin' them brake lines

[Chorus]
I lied
'Cause who knew that if I just let myself go with you
Who knows? Who knows? So, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said, "Fuck you" (Fuck you, fuck you)
I lied, I lied

[Verse 2]
I thought eventually, you would let me go
That was my insecurities and my ego
Missed my jump shot, missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss, miss the D, yo
Man, it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn’t real, it was magic
If it was a record, it woulda been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic (Orgasmic)

[Bridge]
I guess this what I gotta do to keep me from fallin', stallin' the truth
Who knew what you’d do if I let you in?
My mama ain't raised no fool, I
I'm not your usual, typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Fallin' so fast, I'm afraid of you
So I lied

[Chorus]
I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh, whoa

[Outro]
I lied, ooh, baby
Ooh
'Cause who knew that if I let myself go with you (Ooh)
It’s over now, goodbye, love (Ah, oh)
You’ll stay, you’ll stay in my heart (You'll stay in my heart) forever

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Here we go again, it's the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade in your face and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just plannin' a wedding, Caucasian doves
You was just tellin' your mans that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Are you alone? Do you need someone?
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?
Thousand words don't change a thing
Is it only three, three words that you're missing?

[Chorus: Jessie Ware]
Where'd you go? Couldn't see, I was too busy
Could've just said no, where would you go? I think I know
Oh-oh, oh-oh
We're back to playing, we're back to playing
Oh-oh, oh-oh
We're back to playing the crying game

[Post-Chorus: Jessie Ware]
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing the crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing the crying game

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Welcome to the crying game, where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no E-Z Pass, you gotta use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not 'cause I hate ya
Not 'cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it? All this love you speak of
All I want is to love and be loved (To love and be loved)

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win
And I'm comin' undone
'Cause the tears don't end

[Chorus: Jessie Ware]
Where'd you go? Couldn't see, I was too busy
Could've just said no, where would you go? I think I know
Oh-oh, oh-oh
We're back to playing, we're back to playing
Oh-oh, oh-oh
We're back to playing the crying game

[Post-Chorus: Jessie Ware]
I could've given everything (Everything)
Don't wanna let the tears begin (Everything)
We're back to playing the crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing the crying game

[Outro: Jessie Ware]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Baby, it's primal (It's primal)
I want you on all fours (All fours)
And before I let you walk
You gotta show me how you crawl
If you want it all (Yeah, you want it all?)
It's non-negotiable
So do as I say (I say)
If you wanna get the job
You better know who's the boss
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I don't need a dozen roses
You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no
I don't need a pretty poet
Ooh, gettin' all emotional
You gotta beg for it, beg for it (Beg for it)
I wanna see you lookin' up (Lookin' up)

[Chorus: Jeremih and Nicki Minaj]
Want some more, want some more
Even though a nigga been getting to it
Want-want-want some more
(Still, want some more) Want some more, want some more
Everytime I end up getting it
Want-want-want-want some more
When they start talking crazy
That's when I know that they want some more
I know that I'm getting it, but fuck it
'Cause I want some more
Whe-whe-when they start talking crazy
That's when I know that they want some more
Every time I end up getting it

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I-I-I-I'm in this bitch, I'm getting money
One minute they hate me, then they love me
Ain't got nothing for me, these dudes is funny
That's why I'm throwing shade like it's sunny
Who-who-who had Eminem on the first album?
Who had Kanye saying, “She a problem?”
Who the fuck came in the game, made her own column?
Who-who made Lil Wayne give 'em five million?
Why the fuck I gotta say it, though? You niggas don't know it yet?
Football touchdown on the Boeing jet
You my son, but I'm just not showing yet
Wrist icy, but it ain't snowing yet
You can tell I'm the illest, cause my dividend is the biggest
Bitches ain't sitting with us, all my niggas in Margielas, oh
Is pigs flying? Is these bitches trying me?
They think it's sweet? Oh-oh-oh-oh, these bitches got diabetes
You seen that list? It was me, Baby, Jay-Z, and Diddy

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, yo, I'm in this bitch, I'm high-saditty
I popped a Perc and I said, “Thank you”
I'm popping tags every day, it look like my b-day
These bitches suck, so I nickname these bitches “BJ”
They want that union, they want that D-Wade
I tell a ho just be happy they getting leeway
My name Barbie, bitch (My name)
My name Barbie, bitch
Alexander made me Queen, I'm pulling up with the King
I'm late to my own party, bitch
Want it, I get it, I don't be wanting for nothing
I mean, I do what I do and it must be counting for something
I don't be jumping from topic to topic, stay in my pocket
I got your rent in my pocket, so can I pay you to pop it?
Cash Money, getting six albums, no bitch niggas on a bitch album
You niggas apologize when a nigga diss you? That's a big problem

[Chorus: Jeremih and Nicki Minaj]

Am I just a fool?
Blind and stupid for lovin' you
Am I just a silly girl?
So young and naive to think you were...

[Pre-Chorus]
The one who came to take claim of this heart
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just a frame in the dark

[Chorus]
(And now the people) The people are talkin'
The people are sayin' that you have been playin' my heart
Like a grand piano (Piano)
The people are talkin'
The people are sayin' that you have been playin' my heart
Like a grand piano (Piano)

[Post-Chorus]
So play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on

Wrapped up in lies and foolish jewels
What do I see in you?
Maybe I'm addicted to all the things you do
'Cause I keep thinkin' you are...

[Pre-Chorus]
The one who had came to take claim of this heart
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just a frame in the dark

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I just wanna be ya rider, you should pull up in that Spyder
You should let me hit the mic, and I ain't talking about the fighter
Get it lit without a lighter, let's pull an all-nighter
Tell me-tell me what you need, got the weed, I'm a bad lil' bitch and I never indict her
Get locked, I'ma write ya, you on the road? I'ma Skype ya
I-I-I-I-I don't wanna hype ya, but you a lucky nigga if my mean ass like ya
You ain't never have a bitch understand you, most of them wanna use you when they ran through
I just wanna be somebody that can add to, your wife, be a friend, be a teacher and a fan too
I just wanna listen, when you leave I say, "Damn, I fucking miss him"
I just wanna be your vixen, give you something real wet to put your lips in
I wanna be the only one that can check you, and still respect you
Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

Ayo, I just wanna be your first go-to, do you like a real one supposed to, livin' bi-coastal
Scoop me in the truck, late-night on a humble
Meet me out in Queens, where the city want a sundown
You could put your gun down, you could have fun now
You could tell your niggas that you won now, one down
Run through the clubs with the baddest, bitches is the maddest, nothin' else matters (Matters)
And they say, Birkin where the bag is, got a lot of bags, but we never got baggage
Winter Wonderland on my hands, call me Alice, balance
I'ma have you coming in my palace
London, Tokyo, Paris, let me update your status
'Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

[Intro (Throughout): Alicia Keys]
You should say it right now

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Cause I don't use the shit anyway
But okay, I guess it's my fault
Westside shorty, with an eastside nigga
They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take y'all back
'09, double R drop top with the top down
Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist and the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say "love"
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy
The heart from a real one from Philly reppin' that north side?

[Chorus: Meek Mill & Nicki Minaj]
Anybody? Anybody?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy trust
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Rihmeek, I'ma have to tell the truth if I speak
Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day
You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away, I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time?
But you waited

[Chorus: Meek Mill & Nicki Minaj]
Anybody? Anybody?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy trust
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Its a heart for sale, who's buying?
I don't care who's crying
Its trust for sale, who's buying?
I don't care who's lying

Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
Yo
Ayo, tonight is the night that I'ma get twisted
Myx Moscato and vodka, I'ma mix it
Roll that spaceship, we 'bout to get lifted
Live in the present, that gift is for the gifted
This what you came, this what you came for
You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for
Make mistakes though

[Pre-Chorus]
I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's okay, we'll take our time

[Chorus]
The night is still young
The night is still young
The night is still young
And so are we
The night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)
The night is still young (And watch the world pass us by)
The night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)

[Verse 2]
Ayo, drinks on you, or the drinks is on me?
We ain't goin' nowhere like tanks is on E
We still gettin' money, what bank it's gon' be?
If he's sexy, he plankin' on me
So where them big boys with all of that? (Ayy)
Tell the bartender, say my order back (Ayy)
It's bottle service, he ordered that (Ayy)
Might let him take it home and slaughter that
He got friends for all of my friends
They ain't leavin' 'til we say when
And we gon' hangover the next day
But we will remember this day
So drop the pop and get low
And we could drop the top and just cruise
We fresh to death, down to the shoes
My only motto in life is "Don't lose" (Kyuh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's okay, we'll take our time

Got your bitch calling me big daddy
When I pull up all the hoes like big daddy

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Standin' on the corner in some shit that look like I payed like a million for
Blowin' the money I heard that they askin' around town what he really worth

Now these bitches gon' get this work

You niggas so lame that my bitches won't fuck unless you cut a check first

[Chorus: Meek Mill]

When I hit the lot I don't get the little bitch

Ain't gotta sell it, but he say the pussy a drug that he re-up on
Spur of the moment, I ball like Ginóbili, you bitches get D'ed up on
You mad at me? Go get mad at your nigga 'fore I put my sneakers on
He copped me this wrist game, now it's just us at the Knicks game
I might have to take him on tour just to fuck in Australia, Brisbane
Your time is ticking, you bitches will be around shorter than Vine vids
You watch your mouth or my niggas will shoot up the club like what Shyne did

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Your bitch call me big daddy
Tell that bitch that I'm big daddy
When I hit the lot I don't get the little bitch
Nigga I go and get the big daddy

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Yung Berg]

E-e-eight mil' on that new thing
Tied up like my shoe string
Ain’t fuckin' wit' you bitch niggas and that’s real rap, but I do sing
Make room when I come by
Ain’t speakin', I’m dumb high
Just heard niggas got jokes, it’s a matter of time before one dies
'Cause them dudes out and them tools out
All sixes like school’s out
Niggas know if they talk slick
That I’m winter fresh, they’ll get chewed out
‘Cause-'cause-'cause-'cause them dudes out and them tools out
All sixes like school’s out
Niggas know if they talk slick
That I’m winter fresh, they’ll get chewed out (Uh)
Th-th-th-this shit ain’t regular rich (Uh)
So they end up in a ditch (Uh)
I’m not a regular bitch
So when niggas see me, they jump on my dick (Uh)
He not a regular shooter (Uh)
So when you see me, salute her (Uh)
Ain’t got a knife in my hand
But I’m choppin’ it up with some niggas from Cuba (Uh)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Yung Berg]
On the real, nigga, I’m a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
Got real sons, I need a real sitter
When I leave niggas, they get real bitter
O-o-o-on the real, nigga, I’m a real nigga
I-I-I run around with them real niggas
Roll up on ya
R-r-roll up on ya, roll up on ya
R-r-r-r-roll up on ya (Yo)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
A-a-ask Jay who he married
Eighty thousand in Paris
Stadiums with Queen B and that selfie got 'em aggy
These-these bitches is light-weight
I-I’m always at fight-weight
Wrist game is on ice skate
'Cause we move work through that Tri-State
‘Cause them boys out and them toys out
Still bangin' that noise out
You could get it in the wintertime
Or that May weather like Floyd’s out
‘Cause them boys out and them toys out
Still bangin' that noise out
You-you could get it in the wintertime
Or that May weather like Floyd’s out (Uh)
A-a-a-all of these bitches in pocket (Uh)
I’m ‘bout to make a deposit (Uh)
Tell ‘em to go ‘head and gossip
As long as your house is the size of my closet (Uh)
Anybody I call, they picks up (Uh)
Even if they was gettin’ they dick sucked (Uh)
These niggas don’t make a mix-up
Tell ‘em niggas go step they bricks up
Tell ‘em niggas go step they bricks up
Tell ‘em niggas go step they bricks up

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Yung Berg]
On the real, nigga, I’m a real nigga

W-w-w-when we bang, bye, pop pills, now we Shanghai, kyuh

[Verse 1]
I came out lookin' to party, and now I'm ownin' that building
You bitches can't get my spot until I start raisin' some children
These bitches all in they feelings, can't fuck with Nicki, they know it
They know that Nicki a poet, pop me a bottle of Moët
They said I couldn't, but I did it though
Tell 'em I still got that hourglass figure though
Can't stop me, don't watch me
You better just watch your nigga, ho, I'm in that big boy
I am in beast mode, respect the G-code
Bitches ain't got drive, these bitches will get repo'd
I am a monster, this is ambition
This the type of car, that you keep a bad bitch in
Not that I don't got good vision, but I don't see competition
They want me to come and help them, but I am not a magician
I'm on them fo-fours, I'm tippin', you better move out my way
I am not here to play, Pinkprint can't be delayed

[Chorus]
Cause I win again, cause I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, yeah I win again
Can't tell me nothin' about it, your opinion is invalid
Go against me, then you made a mistake

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, cause I came out
'09, when promoters brought Wayne out
Lewinsky, like I couldn't get the stain out
I been bad, like cuttin' school and stayin' out
I been hotter than, vacationin' and layin' out
I sat back and watched how it was playin' out
They diss me, but runnin' and took the same route
Uhn, but no, they not Nicki
Wrist on ice and yes my wrist bricky
If I leave, the game will miss Nicki
Not a website but get money, this is fifty
Pop bottles with my bitches and get pissy
This shit ain't got no more integrity
Don't write they raps, and plus they flow shitty
Don't make me expose you bitch, I'm too busy
Hopped on the Bridge-y, New York City
Nicki still the queen, niggas all ready
Hopped on the Bridge-y, New York City
Nicki still the queen, niggas all ready
Soon as I came in, I told them that I would become the greatest
Muhammad Ali of these bitches, and that can't be debated
I never chicken'd out, skated, I know they mad that I made
All this money I made, all my bitches is laced

[Chorus]
Cause I win again, cause I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, and I win again
And I win again, yeah I win again
Can't tell me nothin' about it, your opinion is invalid
Go against me, then you made a mistake

[Bridge]
So good, so real, so good, yeah
I'ma win again
I'ma win again, yeah
I'm Meryl Streep to all these bitches, they can't do what I do
Sometimes I just look in the mirror and I be like, "Why you?"
Yeah, I know that they mad
But I'ma shit on my critics some more

[Outro]
I am, I am
I am still gonna do, what he sent me to do
That's kill, kill, everything in, everything in my way
That's kill, kill, everything in, everything in my way
That's kill, kill, everything in, everything in my way
They know I am a champion
All champions do
It's all champions do

[Verse 1]
Blister on a turnpike, won't you let me by
I only want to wonder why when I don't die
Please don't ask me, I don't know
I only want to go where my wheels roll

[Chorus]
Monday, I'm all high
Get me out of F-L-A
I cut class, in school, yeah
Momma, just give me a break

[Verse 2]
Choo-Choo Charlie had a pretty good band
But he couldn't understand why no one would go
The World Record Players on a tour of Japan
Charlie's fixing his van with the left arm tan, he said

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Everybody's wondering, where'd he go?
He must be down in Pensacola hiding from the snow
Blister on a turnpike, won't you let me by
I only want to wonder why when I don't die

[Chorus]
Monday, I'm all high
Get me out of T-L-A
In school, yeah, I fooled ya
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
All right

[Verse:Drake]
Ayye Yo DJ Wristpect let's get em'
Veterans like "How dare all of this arrogance"
What you expect when all they do is draw comparisons between us and Americans
And tell me go hard well I'm going harder now
Bumpin Shawn Carter cause there ain't a Shawn Carter now, feel me
Get with it, I'm trying to overthrow a nation using fade to black as a nigga's only motivation
I'm picking and choosing an army and thinking of moving my talent is proven
A show of hands who's in?
And if you must know, this year I'm going for the gusto plus though seat feeling like a bus load
So take me as I am  have nada of me the red stripe on my jacket show you that Prada love me
I'm a threat in a city of no legends imagine that a whole Sistine with no brethrens
No blood glide gunshots identity this you a rapper homie leave that for Trinity Chris word
See my role models roll with models and switch gold bottles holding more dough than the whole lotto
So while you clowns making toasts in a cheap bar the whole ATF make mimosas with the clicquot
What up Nikko, Jordan, Lucky and TJ nicknamed the Night Fox clique we take it easy
You Prime Ministers claim you repping the T, I need a Motherfucking president to represent me nigga

It's a bad bitch in my bed and she got that stupid head
Got me Versace, shop, shawty, catch me walkin' out of 5ths
With a lit Glock 40 and a couple extra clips
Lenox Mall in the closet, all my hoes exotic
And ain't that shit ironic that my doors go up, robotic?

I can talk the shit cause I got it
It's Gucci Mane, I'm a walkin' lick
Got dead people in my pocket
Fallin' off in Follie's, got a bag full of the mollies
A half a mil' off profit, and my Muller got her jockin'

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I got a pocket full of dead people
Evil voices in my head tellin' me go get this bread
Got a pocket full of dead people
Evil voices in my head tellin' me to get this bread
I got a pocket full of dead people
Evil voices in my head tellin' me go get this bread
Got a pocket full of dead people
Evil voices in my head tellin' me to get this bread

[Verse 2: Raury]
I've been livin' like a king all week
I'm a peasant at the end of every day
I've been chillin' with my niggas in the streets
Livin' like a vagabond, wild, free, run away
Reminiscin' 'bout them bored summer days
Blowin' haze on the east side of Atlanta
Makin' moves on the shawty, a Hispania
We don't speak the same language so excuse me if I stammer
I understand you wanna pick up  the hammer
And build up your own, she see her brother climbin' the ladder
It's your time, yeah it's somethin' that you figure
I mean you can do it too but you can't be a bitch ass nigga
Get up off your ass, find a fuckin' craft
Make bread, get it back, give it back times 2
Who are you? Look in the mirror
Don't give a fuck what they think, you're the one, you're the truth
Got the juice, got the juice, got the juice, got the juice
Mothafucka you the man like an 8th grade Jew
You can chew through any zebra ass in the zoo
Any nigga tryna act hard as some leather boots, fuck them
And anyone tryna step on you, fire burnin'
Nigga learnin', stay concernin' bout your paper
Now and later ain't really good time
For a nigga 'bout his business on Wood Crest Manor

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I got a pocket full of dead people
Evil voices in my head tellin' me go get this bread
Got a pocket full of dead people
Evil voices in my head tellin' me to get this bread
I got a pocket full of dead people
Evil voices in my head tellin' me go get this bread
Got a pocket full of dead people
Evil voices in my head tellin' me to get this bread

[Verse 1]
I got on 15 diamond chains like I’m a slave man
Drag her by her hair like I’m a cave man
She gave me a block of money when I got out of jail
I told her we gon buy a bale, bitch let’s buy us a bale
I love cooking cocaina man but I hate the smell of it
Niggas snitching on me wanna go and call 12 and shit
My bitch so bad that I might just buy a V12 for that
I don’t miss being on Big Cat but I miss all of them scraps and shit
Niggas riding with me 17, 18, and got gas and shit
I think I need some mice traps cause my hood full rats ya bitch (mices)
Hood nigga from Bouldercrest, but I got this classic dick
Producing my own movies, turn your bitch to an actress
Guwop tell 'em turn up nigga, and all of this classic shit
And I’m in East Atlanta zoo, Wop feel like Ol' Dirty Bastard did
Tryna stop Brick Squad from cuttin' like sinking the Titanic bitch
Brick squad 1017, I gives a fuck bout Atlantic bitch

[Hook]
These fuck niggas ain’t getting no money, these fuck niggas ain’t getting no money
Small time nigga and you still getting fronted
Talking big money, but ain’t got no money
These fuck niggas ain’t getting no money, these fuck niggas ain’t getting no money
Small time nigga and you still getting fronted
Talking big money, but ain’t got no money

[Verse 2]
Bitch so bad, she got more money than most these rappers got
Guwop, I got more bales, bricks than probably most of these trappers got
Say you in the bando but I don’t see no dope my nig
And Guwop is so dangerous he might just kidnap your kids
I got this wig on but man I’m not doing drag ya bitch
I’m on some such slick shit, I just might kidnap your bitch
Say you’re trapping hard but your tryna kidnap a bitch
I’m the type of niggas that get taxed when I tax your clique
Ran up on the plug cause a nigga went broke
I ain’t give a damn cause he had no hope
Gucci got boats like 34 and these boats here cost 34
30 something hundred if a nigga ain’t on it
Remember when the bags cost 85 hundred?
Me and HB coming through the SV so many PTs probably need an RV

[Hook]
These fuck niggas ain’t getting no money, these fuck niggas ain’t getting no money
Small time nigga and you still getting fronted
Talking big money, but ain’t got no money
These fuck niggas ain’t getting no money, these fuck niggas ain’t getting no money
Small time nigga and you still getting fronted
Talking big money, but ain’t got no money

Look at me, me

Baby, we don't worry about keys

All of you negative motherfuckers should look to me as inspiration. I'm 23 fucking years old and I built a fucking monster and I'm not ever gonna fucking land. Stop being scared and negative. Start believing in yourself and stop living for all these other fucking idiots. Some of y'all should put that fucking blunt down and go do what the fuck you know you need to do. Do it for yourself. I believe in everyone because I believe in myself. Fuck reaching for the stars, that's setting a limit. Fuck those. Some of you don't like yourself. Some of you aren't comfortable with yourself. That's so fucking sad. Stop that shit. Some of you can't. That's why y'all ask for likes on Instagram and shit, because y'all's self esteem is so fucking low. Cut that shit out and start liking yourself. When that happens, you will start trusting yourself, then you trust your ideas, then you fucking become that person you really want to be. If you don't have any confidence, let me be your fucking confidence

I'm gonna be a fucking great years from now and I fully believe that and fully do not care about anyone's opinion on why I'm not because I know. Start smiling more and start hanging around people that makes you feel good or make you want to be better. Stop associating with losers. If a nigga only hits you up to smoke or drink or turn up and have nothing else to offer to get you where ever you think about being when you are alone daydreaming, then get the fuck away from them. Time is going by so fast and before you know it, you're gonna be on your deathbed telling stories about how much you sucked and how you regret not living the life you wanted to live, loving the people you wanted to love, taking the chances you wanted to take. THERE ARE NO RULES. FUCK THE RULES. GO. FIND YOUR WINGS. I FOUND MY WINGS AND I'M STILL FLYING AND I WILL NEVER EVER LAND. Some of you have to find yourself. I knew who I was at like age 10. I knew the music, I loved the colors, and I knew what I was into. Most of you listen to what ever is hot or what your friends like, y'all dress how everyone else dresses, y'all do what everyone else does. FUCKING STOP BEING A FUCKING FOLLOWER. Read the comments, the weak ass follower that will never make a difference ever because they fucking suck are gonna say some shit like "easier said than done" or "you are a hypocrite" or "you changed" or some stupid shit like that, because they are the weak fucks that I'm talking about and they can't cope with it, cause they are scared. DON'T BE SCARED

I don't know why I'm typing this. I'm on a lake on vacation just drawing and listening to music (I've been playing CC The World for like 6 hours) and I just realized, "Oh wow! I'm on a vacation for no reason, this is crazy. I've dreamed of this. How did I get this far? Oh yeah, by trusting myself and not following the path that my mom wanted me to go, and by surrounding myself with other people that wanted more out of life and trusted my wild ideas, and I put my art out there and people liked it and trusted me, and now I'm here. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I want everyone to win. I want everyone to smile. I want everyone to be in a good mood and annoying and always jumping around like me cause I'm so fucking happy and grateful, but I realize niggas is scared. Or who knows, maybe I'm just a special one. I don't know anything. I'm in the woods and I really want to meet a moose in person. If I see one I'm gonna get a photo. Hahahahahaha. Oh, and RACISM IS FUCKING WEAK AS FUCK ANTI GOLF BOYS. This saturday, there will be another fall/winter drop from GOLF. Love you. Today, I want you to find your wings

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Let me tell you a little story about my homie Corey
Right now he's locked down serving at least forty
But excuse me, I got ahead of myself, I'm sorry son
This story starts in his youth, he was hardly one
When his pops got knocked for coping rocks
From under cover cops on the corner of his block
And he never got a chance to meet him
Cause the very next year his pops is laying still in the prison cell bleeding from stab wounds, fatal
Bad news Corey's mother and older brother already caught in the struggle
Brother barely ate tryna hustle just to carry weight
The whole family underweight cause they rarely ate
One thing my nigga never got was love
And his whole childhood he was watching drug addicts
His brother supplying it, old mother buying it
You expect a scientist to come from this environment
Get real!, this shits hard enough brought up black
But being poor plus your mums on crack
And your brothers a hustler tryna take you under his wing shit, just a fucking wonder his breathing

[Hook: J. Cole]
If I could change the world I would
Snap my fingers and bad would turn to good
Let me change the world, I'm wishing
I promise you I'll make a difference
If I could change the world I would
Snap my fingers and bad would turn to good
Let me change the world, I'm wishing
I promise you ill make a difference

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Age five, Corey had dreams to be a cop, but
Age six, his older brother passed the Glock, let him hold it
Plans change, he started his campaign
Age thirteen, little boy doing big man things
And that's what he thought
He was jacking rims from mustangs
Beating down on his class mates for chump change
Running round with the tough gang
The older niggas he sold dope for 'em, they bought clothes for him
However, soon he got older and selling petty dimes turned into some pretty heavy crimes
The shit got to the point where he was stealing rides from his block
Even robbing quick stops
Ladies loved him, he was crazy fucking
Knocking boos daily, pretty soon he had a baby coming
But he didn't claim it, his baby mother was crazy loving him
She said "Baby, let's settle down," he left her hanging
He'd rather be on the streets slanging a wild cat
But god damn i seen it coming a mile back
A drug deal gone bad guns bursting
Now Corey lying in a cell cause he merked him
Whats the moral of the story?, figure it out
So the next time you ask why niggas are wild
You know with out a doubt, don't try and deny the shit
Young black male, a product of his environment

[Hook: J. Cole]
If I could change the world I would
Snap my fingers and bad would turn to good
Let me change the world, I'm wishing
I promise you I'll make a difference
If I could change the world I would
Snap my fingers and bad would turn to good
Let me change the world, I'm wishing
I promise you ill make a difference

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Cause i can't stand to see my people struggling
But what we up against? tough conditions in this life
And they wonder why these niggas all get hype, get high and fist fight
Or why they live like they living, to get ice and cars
No type of jobs, income coming from dicing and robbing niggas in broad daylight
Its hard cause all they know in this life is scars
This mic is all i need to change the globe, re-arrange it and make it so
Niggas ain't in pain no more
Cause they they don't pay no more mind to all youth
Till they got to locking them up and dawg that's the truth yo
Thats the truth yo, that's the truth

We gotta pray
We gotta pray

[Verse 1]
We gotta pray, pray for the world tonight
We gotta save, somebody save somebody tonight
Fire in the air, what the Hell goin' on?
Sirens everywhere, singin' that street song
Violence everywhere, barely holdin' on

[Refrain]
What the Hell goin' on? Do you know who you are?
Do you know who we are?

[Chorus]
We, we're extraordinary people
Livin' an ordinary life, one extraordinary question
Are we gonna run or fight?
So we gotta pray

[Verse 2]
Pray for the love tonight
End of the day, pray for another try
Smoke is in the sky, what the Hell goin' on?
Bullets gonna fly, hot right from the gun
Tryin' not to cry, barely holdin' on

[Refrain]

[Chorus]
We, we're extraordinary people
Livin' an ordinary life, one extraordinary question
Are we gonna live or die?
So we gotta pray

[Outro]
We gotta pray
We gotta pray
We gotta pray
We gotta pray
You have to be like a beast. You have to be a beast. That’s the only way they respect you. I came up under Wayne, and Wayne has his way of doing things. When Wayne walks up on the motherfuckin' set and-and say, "Don’t talk to me, have my fucking music ready, get the fuck up out of my face, I’mma blow this shit in your fucking face all day, it’s cool. But every time I -- every time I put my foot down and stand up for myself, it’s like, "We’ve heard about Nicki Minaj! Nicki Minaj shut down a photo shoot! Oh my god! No one wants to work with Nicki Minaj!"

I’m glad you heard. Now, when I come to a photoshoot, let it be of quality. You know why? Because I put quality in what I do. I spend time, and I spend energy, and I spend effort, and I spend everything I have, every fiber of my being to give people quality. So if I turn up to a photoshoot and you had -- you got a fifty dollar clothes budget and some sliced pickles on the motherfucking board, you wanna know what? No, I am gonna leave. Is that wrong? For wanting more for myself? Wanting people to treat me with respect? But you know what? Next time they know better. But I had accepted the pickle juice, I would be drinking pickle juice right now

When I am assertive, I’m a bitch. When a man is assertive, he’s a boss. (He bossed up.) He bossed up! No negative connotation behind "bossed up." But lots of negative connotation behind being a bitch

Donald Trump can say, "You’re fired!" Let Martha Stewart run her company the same way and be the same way! "Fuck, oh, evil bitch." But Donald Trump, he gets to hang out with young pussies and have 50 different wives and just be cool… "Oh, Donald we love ya. Donald Trump…" But when you’re a girl, you have to be like… everything. You have to be -- you have to be dope at what you do, but you have to be super sweet, and you have to be sexy, and you have to be this, and you have to be that, and you have to be nice, and you have to… It’s like, I can’t be all those things at once. I’m a human being… I don’t mean to be ranting and raving like this. I don’t -- don’t use this footage, please; it’s just gonna make me look stupid
She falls
The look of disillusion fresh upon her quickly fading eyes
Across the room the guilty party turns and leaves
Their story woven on the coattails of a ghost
We wonder
We question
Why are you gone?

The stains are steamed
The walls receive a perfect coat of white
To cover up the homicide
The family grieves
The memories remain
The years washing away

We question the outcome, the fairness
We wonder what will happen to us
We struggle to let go in anger
We ask aloud
Why are you
Woven on the coattails of a ghost
Woven on the coattails of a ghost
Woven on the coattails of a ghost
Woven on the coattails of a ghost
Woven on the coattails
On December 4th, 2014, Rolling Stone reported that Lil Wayne wanted freedom from his record label, Cash Money. This news surprised many fans, as Wayne had worked for them his entire career. Furthermore, this development came almost a week before his album was set to be released, "Tha Carter V." The album had already been delayed once, and Wayne claims Cash Money is holding it back.

[Chorus]
What time it is?
What time it is?

Say I'm trained to kill
Say I'm trained to kill
Say I'm trained to kill
Say I'm trained to kill

[Verse]
Head ain't shit she must have dropped out of high school
Song on her ringtone, got it from iTunes
Instead of sayin' "Bye", you need to be sayin' "Hi" to him
Don't walk, don't run, bitch fly to him, dumbass
What you mean we ain't eating, girl you know my crew obese
And I smoke that strong every day like Wiz Khalif'
3 5 for the cheese shouts out to my big homie Pete
Let me talk Chinese, shouts out to YL and Wee Wee
Niggas talk bad, but they really want to be me
Threw 35,000 on him, Dirk Nowitzki
Joc in this bitch with me
8 in the Benz with me
Yeah, they got red and blue flags on it
And if they talking bills, I put that on it
And if the bitch burping, put an ad on it
I call 

[?] up, can I smash on it?
And he like "Smash on it"
So I smash on they freak the ho
Yeah
I smash on they freak the ho

[Chorus]
What time it is?
What time it is?
I'm hot for real
You grinding still
I'm a doctor like Phil
I'm a Spartan for real
I'm trained to kill
I'm trained to kill
And I'm hot for real
You grinding still
If you trained to kill
If you trained to kill
Say I'm trained to kill
Say I'm trained to kill
Say I'm trained to kill
Say I'm trained to kill

[Outro]
Yeah, hey Joc
I'm trained to kill
And they grinding still
And I'm hot for real
And I know you trained to kill
So say I'm trained to kill

[Intro: Skypad War]
Hey, I'm a product, you can order me
It's Audemars, Gucci, and Louie V
Them hoes used to throw up, now them bitches swallow
I used to drink shots, now it's out the bottle

[Chorus: Young Thug (& Skypad War)]
I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now get out of line, and I'll call on y'all (Okay)
If I ever fall, I'll fall on y'all (War)
It's like referees with us, how we ball on y'all

[Verse 1: Skypad War]
I bossed up on 'em when I copped the coupe
And opened up their eyes when I dropped the roof
I ain't Rick Ross, but I'm a fuckin' boss
I told her she could ride if she gave me mouth
But she gotta hurry up, cause we headed South
And she gotta do Thug if I switch the route
They say I'm bougie 'cause I travel with my Louis bag
But when I reach, I take my Gucci out my Louis bag
New boss, y'all out, vetoed
I'm transferrin' money from my evo
New house, so I'm lookin' through the peephole
'Cause ain't nothin' s'posed to be here but the kilo

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now get out of line, and I'll call on y'all
If I ever fall, I'll fall on y'all
It's like referees with us, how we ball on y'all

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
No homo, but we balls on y'all
I fell to the sky, call it a skyfall
No, we do not fall, we are not y'all
We go the hardest, ROC crew smartest
New condo, I can see Madison's garden
And I'm in the 4 with the green, no Rick Marvin
Now I got to work for the fiends, no more starvin'
No more starvin, Marvin
I'm ridin' this beat like it's taking me to a million
They gonna take me to prison, 'cause I made a killin'
10 racks on me, my whole money, no written
And if you try to take it, you'll be left with no ceilings
Shoot him in the chest several times, that's no feelings
Shoot the fuckboy from the upstairs, still no feelings
If he fuck up with the money, no more dealings
Still fuck with white boy, shouts out to Willie
Your bitch in the condo suckin' on all us (all us)
She'll be suckin' on all us
She's an anteater, she's just suckin' on all us
(And what if we skeet?)
So just swallow this dick

[Chorus: Young Thug (& Capo Kam)]
I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now get out of line, and I'll call on y'all
If I ever fall, I'll fall on y'all (Capo)
It's like referees with us, how we ball on y'all

[Verse 3: Capo Kam]
Okay, now hundred thousand dollars in a rubber band
And fuck them haters, they ain't shit, 'cause they ain't got a plan
I got a vision for the paper, y'all just think I'm playin'
Life bigger than what you see but y'all ain't even carin'

[Chorus: Young Thug (& Capo Kam)]
I remember when I used to call on y'all (Okay)
Now get out of line, and I'll call on y'all (Let's go)
If I ever fall, I'll fall on y'all (Okay)
It's like referees with us, how we ball on y'all

[Verse 4: Capo Kam]
Straight off the top, I can name niggas that really bitches
But Corey got the beat runnin', so no time for snitches
Now that I'm on, I can get you all off like light switches
Now I ain't switchin', I'm just tellin' you how it is
Most of my niggas died, but they never got to live
I do this shit for us, let's go

[Chorus: Young Thug]
And I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now get out of line, and I'll call on y'all
If I ever fall, I'll fall on y'all
It's like referees with us, how we ball on y'all

[Outro: Young Thug]
And I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now get out of line, and I call on y'all
I ever fall, I fall on y'all
I'm so straight, I'm gonna fall on y'all
Too straight, I'm gonna fall on y'all
I'm so straight, I'm gonna fall on y'all
I remember when I used to call on y'all
Now I'm so straight I'm gonna fall on y'all

I do it for the streets, yeah, I do it for my city
You know you gotta love it
You know you gotta love it
Stretchin' that paper long, shawty, she wanna roll
Tell me where you wanna go, girl

[Verse 1]
Said don't leave home without it, 'out it
Money gotta have, gotta have that bank
American Express, all good
But'll need that cash in my hand, point blank
I'll, it touch it, rub it, hug it, love it
Number one subject, keep me rubbin'
G5 on the jet to Dublin
I need that money, man, people say wait
I think we cousins, no you ain't
I don't wanna break you off, I got
Cash to floss
You can't bank the boss with that lame game
Bank tryna count my change, change
Stretch that paper my aim
Shoot me a stack to the brain
Rock like ammo in a Lac' or the Range
Rambo cash, Green Beret fame
All this bread and still I want more
All this cheese, I got the light dough
All these P's, I got the beef flow
Shawty, if you wanna roll, lil' mama let's go
My pockets is swole, get rid of your clothes
Jump up on that pole, my mind on my dollars
You already know, I got my...

[Chorus]
Mind on my money, money on my mind
Tryna stack paper, countin' every little dime
Down to the penny, holla if ya hear me
I do it for the streets, yeah, I do it for my city
You know you gotta love it
You know you gotta love it
Stretchin' that paper
Long, shawty, she wanna roll
Tell me where you wanna go, girl

[Verse 2]
Hey, I do it, do it, do it for the streets, streets
Everybody in the  ghetto gotta eat
Could've bought me a Bentley GT
But I fell in love with the size of the Maybach seats
Feel like a king when I'm on South Beach
Livin' that dream with this M.O.B
Get, gettin' that cream while I travel overseas
Feelin' them beats with the face of a Queen Elizabeth
A little bit, need all my guap, I'm lovin' it
Show up to the hood, I'm thuggin' it, wifebeater
Off in public
Got more cheese than a government from the projects
But I ain't strugglin', get it poppin', champagne bubblin'
Red carpets, wax so Southernin'
Just bought a resort and I'm on three acres
Go to New York and rock Fuscia gators
Dance aboard, six grand to the waiters
Fans support, I get it like the Lakers
Off of the porch where they think about paper
Don't need to fuck when I eat with the majors
Passport say I get my paid in Malaysia
All over Asia, 'cause my

[Chorus]
Mind on my money, money on my mind
Tryna stack paper, countin' every little dime
Down to the penny, holla if ya hear me
I do it for the streets, yeah, I do it for my city
You know you gotta love it
You know you gotta love it
Stretchin' that paper
Long, shawty, she wanna roll
Tell me where you wanna go, girl

[Bridge]
Where all my NY, NY people gettin' cash?
We gettin' cash, we gettin' cash, oh, we gettin' cash
Where all my LA, LA people countin' stacks?
We countin' stacks, we countin' stacks, oh, we countin' cash
Where all my MIA people that's throwin' cash?
We throwin' cash, we throwin' cash, oh we throwin' cash
Where all my H-Town people makin' stacks?
We makin' stacks, we makin' stacks, oh, we makin' stacks

[Chorus]
Mind on my money, money on my mind
Tryna stack paper, countin' every little dime
Down to the penny, holla if ya hear me
I do it for the streets, yeah, I do it for my city
You know you gotta love it
You know you gotta love it
Stretchin' that paper
Long, shawty, she wanna roll
Tell me where you wanna go, girl

[Chorus]
Touch me, baby, touch me all night long

Shawty thats definitely a felony
Want me to touch you? That's cool
I spend my paper on you
And pick you up in my coupe
And make it do what it do

This is B.o.B
Coming live from the underground
All the ghettos across America
And this is my report

[Chorus:]
You know I'm down
Know there ain't no other way (I hold ya down)
You know I'm down for you (You know I'm down)
I said there ain't no other way (I hold ya down)
I hold it down for you (You know I'm down)

You know I'm down for you (You know I'm down)
I hold it down for ya (I hold ya down)
You know I'm down for you (You know I'm down)
That's right, that's right

[Verse:]
Yea, yea man I'm down for y'all
Can't really say that I'm down for the streets
'Cause the streets up underneath your feet
The streets on ya mind and that's all ya think about
Look into the eyes of the kids in the hood
Daddy ain't around so they feel no good
So they go to school and they say "Fuck a book"
Lil' girls skippin' and they fuckin' in the woods
And I ain't just talkin' about blacks
I'm talking about anybody who smokes blacks
Anybody who buys pokes by the pack
And fo' that trap, who knows it's a trap
But they still gotta 'cause they can't get work
Tryin' to feed kids on a burger king shirt
Get no help but they still pay taxes
Sleepin' on a dirty ass mattress
Wait a minute, this shit backwards
Now everybody gettin' mad at us
All 'cause the south be snappin' and
Well fuck you nigga, what's happenin?
This is just how we adapt to this
Environment, and that's why I'm rappin'

[Verse 1]
Hiya honey
What ya doin'?
I been hula-hoopin' waiting for you, aah
Whoa haters, fakers, mass-manipulators
Don't know what you're tryin' to prove
I'm the New York City queen queen
You should hear me sing sing
Baby I'm the real thing, check one two
Stop looking at my train-wreck life and start
Listening to the way I sing the blues

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You know, I know what they say about me
I know that they think I'm danger
So what if it makes me happy, happy, happy?

[Chorus]
It doesn't really matter what you say
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Baby you can't stop me, stop me, now
When I'm hot, I'm hot

[Verse 2]
"Hiya honey
How's it goin'?
Saw you skipping up on TV looking blue aah
You're shakin', makin' music and you're famous
Deep down you're the same girl I knew"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
She said, I know what they say about you
I know that they think you're crazy
I know that they are mistaken, baby, baby

[Chorus]
It doesn't really matter what they say
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Baby you can't stop me, stop me, now
When I'm hot, I'm hot

[Bridge]
Singing for the gangsters
Chasin' all that paper
Living life so dangerously
And there's nothing for my anger
Money is my savior
I can be whatever I think
It's like heaven, heaven
Living on the edge never knowing where I'm going to be
And I am dreading, never settling down
That's when dying is beginning to please

[Chorus]
It doesn't really matter what you say
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Honey you can't stop me, stop me, now
When I'm hot, I'm hot

[Verse 1]
Bored on Friday night
Spinning 'round just like I'm hypnotised, oh
Need some neon lights
Wanna feel like I'm electrified, so help me out

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Get your boyfriend's car
Come and pick me up, oh
Let's take it for a ride
What trouble can we find?

[Chorus 1]
One night, and we're gonna come and crash the party
Weren't invited but we're feeling so outrageous
Just like we're famous
Got one night, and we're gonna come and get it started
Now we're falling down the stairs
We act so shameless
Come on, let's lose control!

[Chorus 2]
One night, and we're gonna come and crash the party
Weren't invited but we're feeling so outrageous
Just like we're famous
Got one night, and we're gonna come and get it started
Now we're falling down the stairs
We act so shameless
Just like we're famous

[Hook]
Uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Uh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Uh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Just like we're famous

[Verse 2]
Blown up like balloons
Purple glitter flying through the air, oh-oh
Sweat drips from the roof
And you know we're Lucy in this sky of diamonds

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Music playing loud
Tripping through the crowd, oh
Put your sunglasses on
Don't care if we look dumb

[Chorus 1] + 

[Chorus 2] + 

[Hook x2]

[Chorus 2] + 

[Hook x2]

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
She can't hide, no matter how hard she tries
Her secret disguise behind the lies
And at night, she cries away her pride
With eyes shut tight, staring at her inside
All her friends know why she can't sleep at night
All her family asking if she's alright
All she wants to do is get rid of this hell
Well, all she's gotta do is stop kidding herself

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
She can only fool herself for so long
She can only fool herself for so long
She can only fool herself for so long
(I'm too weak to face me!) She can only fool herself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
When it comes to how to live his life, he can't be told
Says he's got it all under control
Thinks he knows it's not a problem he's stuck with
But in reality, it'd be a problem to just quit
An addict and he can't hold the reigns
The pain is worse 'cause his friends have it the same
Tries to slow down the problem he's got
But can't get off the carousel until he makes it stop

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
He can only fool himself for so long
He can only fool himself for so long
He can only fool himself for so long
(I'm too weak to face me!) He can only fool himself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Fly with me, under the wings I gave you
Try to be closer to me and I'll save you
Fly with me, under the wings I gave you
Try to be closer to me and I'll save you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me
I never know just why you run
So far away, far away from me

[Intro]
Well, its eight o'clock in Boise, Idaho
I'll find my limo driver
Mister, take us to the show
I done made some plans for later on tonight
I'll find a little queen
And I know I can treat her right

What's your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl?
Won't you do the same?

Back at the hotel
Lord we got such a mess
It seems that one of the crew
Had a go with one of the guests, oh yes
Well, the police said we can't drink in the bar
What a shame
Won't you come upstairs girl
And have a drink of champagne
What's your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl?
Won't you do the same?

What's your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl?
Won't you do the same?

[Bridge]
What's your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl?
Won't you do the same?

Nine o'clock the next day
And I'm ready to go
I got six hundred miles to ride
To do one more show, oh no
Can I get you a taxi home
It sure was grand
When I come back here next year
I want to see you again

What was your name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl?
Well there ain't no shame
What's was name, little girl?
What's your name?
Shootin' you straight, little girl?
Won't you do the same?

[Chorus]
I need your love
I need it even when it hurts me
I won't give up
I won't give up, so come and get me

[Verse 1]
Boy, you really messed around
Put me six feet underground
Always kick me when I'm down
But I'm still driving through your town

[Pre-Chorus]
Tried to fake it, I can't take it
Boy you trapped my heart
I can't shake it, 'bout to break into a hundred million parts

[Chorus] (x2)

[Verse 2]
Wish that you could wear my crown
And feel the weight I'm feeling now
But I can't help but say your name
It's lightning when you're in my veins

[Pre-Chorus] + 

[Chorus x2]

[Bridge]
Boy, you really broke my heart
Took my love and tore it up
But I'm coming back for you
Coming clean out of the blue
All the things you did to me
I forgive them quietly
But I will never forget
And still I end up in your bed

[Chorus - Variation] (x2)
(I need your love)
I don't want it
(I need it even when it hurts me)
You really hurt me, baby
(I won't give up)
Now, I'm giving up
(I won't give up, so come and get me)
Don't you come and get me, baby

[Chorus]
We're staying all night
We never slow down
I think we better do it like we're doing it now
It's been a long time
Since we've been around
So come on, let's keep doing it like we're doing it
Doing it like we're doing it

[Verse 1]
Waited so long just to be here
Now we're bringing this back to life
Yeah, we're bringing this back to life
Want you to know how I miss ya
Now I got you right by my side
Yeah, I got you right by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
Locked inside my veins you're in my blood, in my blood
And we're united forevermore

[Chorus]
We're staying all night
We never slow down
I think we better do it like we're doing it now
It's been a long time
Since we've been around
So come on, let's keep doing it like we're doing it
Doing it like we're doing it

[Hook]
Keep doing it like we're doing it
Doing it like we're doing it

[Verse 2]
Friends like a team in a circle
We're together we're so alive
Yeah, together we're so alive
Joy like a jewel let it sparkle
Know that I got your back for life
Yeah, I got your back for life

[Pre-Chorus]
Locked inside my veins you're in my blood, in my blood
And we're united forevermore

[Chorus]
We're staying all night
We never slow down
I think we better do it like we're doing it now
It's been a long time
Since we've been around
So come on, let's keep doing it like we're doing it
Doing it like we're doing it

[Hook]
Keep doing it like we're doing it
Doing it like we're doing it
Keep doing it like we're doing it

[Bridge]
All night long
We dancing to this song
We doing it, we going on and on, on and on
All night long
We dancing to this song
We doing it, we going on and on, on and on

[Chorus]
We're staying all night
We never slow down
I think we better do it like we're doing it now
It's been a long time
Since we've been around
So come on, let's keep doing it like we're doing it
Doing it like we're doing it

[Hook - Variation] (x2)
(All night long we dancing to this song)
Keep doing it like we're doing it
Doing it like we're doing it

[Chorus]
We're staying all night
We never slow down
I think we better do it like we're doing it now
It's been a long time
Since we've been around
So come on, let's keep doing it like we're doing it
Doing it like we're doing it

[Verse 1]
You're so damn cold
You got no feeling
I want my blood hotter
Not satisfied
I need to taste it
Your sex is so over

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Got the gun in my hand and I point it straight
To the target and I'm gonna blow my brains
I don't need you, my touch is better
I'm rolling much hotter

[Chorus]
Lights out, I'm on
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
Cause I'm gone, so high
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
Cause I can make it feel just like I'm hanging on
Yeah, I can do it better when I'm all alone
Lights out, so high
All alone
I got a body of my own

[Verse 2]
I'm in control
My hands are shaking
My skin's getting wetter
I'm coming close
It's overloaded
I walk in with fire

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Spin around in my head, I'm screaming out
But with you in the room I can never shout
This heroin, I'm sinking so deep
Wish I could stay here forever

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Lights out
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
Cause I'm gone, so high
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
Cause I'm gone, so high
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
Cause I'm gone, so high
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
Cause I'm gone

[Verse 1]
Help me out, I need escape
It's the truth, I got to go
With all the boys in the back alley
And all my girls in the superstore
Because we need electricity
City lights gotta glow for me
Oh I'm more than a car park queen
So get your shit now, we got to roll

[Chorus]
Let's blow out of this town
Too bored, hanging around
Sky high, head in the clouds
Never gonna come down
Drums, bass, turn 'em up loud
Free fall, spinning around
Sky high, head in the clouds
Never gonna come down

[Verse 2]
Take the car and cut the brakes
Driving out into the dark
Even though I love mum and dad
I wanna swim out there with the sharks
I wanna learn to speak Japanese
Razor-sharp on the silver screen
We were made for a limousine
So get your shit now and come with me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Blowing bubbles out in the grass
All tangled in the stars, getting faded in the back seat
You can be hanging with us
We used to walk around the backstreets
Swimming pools with no heat
Fuck a dream, I want it for real
Always make it look so easy, moving to the city
Take a little sip of surreal
We're much more than nothing, yeah, we're all just trying to be who we feel

[Pre-Chorus]
Throwing cake up in the air, we don't care, no
Surfing on a silver wave, wanna let go
We're so bored of being here, we don't care, no
I wanna run, be wild and free, and with my friends standing next to me

[Chorus]

[Outro] (x2)
Hey!
Oo-ah-ah
Oo-ah-ah
Hanging a-
Hanging a-
Hey!
Oo-ah-ah
Oo-ah-ah
Hanging a-
Hanging around

[Intro]
Oh, I could die tonight
Cause I got the magic in my veins
And I'm going hard with all my friends
I could die tonight

[Verse 1]
Let's get it started
Poolside at the party
Rolling Stones on my phone
Hanging in your bedroom, feeling like we're rock 'n' roll
End of the summer
Up and down with lovers
Laying under stars that shine
Hold up our palms now, don't you know that it's our time?

[Chorus]
Oh, I could die tonight
Cause I got the magic in my blood
And I'm staying til the sun comes up
Oh whoa, I could die tonight
Cause I got the magic in my veins
And I'm going hard with all my friends
I could die tonight

[Verse 2]
Back at the hotel
Ringing off the doorbells
Now we're feeling so alive
Climb to the top floor, jumpin' like we're 'bout to fly
No one's leaving
'Bout to blow the ceiling
When we turn it up to ten
Wake up in the morning, gonna do it all again

[Chorus] (x2)

[Outro]
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
(Die tonight)
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
(Die tonight)

[Verse 1]
Why won't you call me?
Just give me your mouth
Won't you be straight with me
I can be older
Just give me the chance
I will win it all

Can you control this sea at night?
T-take cover

[Chorus 1]
Relax your lips
Long blonde hair
I don't know if
You're even there
(Put out the fire)
I never let go
(Put out the fire)
I let the flames grow
Don't call it quits
Cold hard stare
I won't go if
You're standing there
(Put out the fire)
I never let go
(Put out the fire)
I let the flames

[Verse 2]
I'm really sorry
But I will win unintentionally
You can be sober
I want to dance
And I'm not dancing alone

Can you control this sea at night?
Would you patrol with yellow lights?

[Chorus 2]
Relax your lips
Long blonde hair
I don't know if
You're even there
(Put out the fire)
I never let go
(Put out the fire)
I let the flames grow
Don't call it quits
Cold hard stare
I won't go if
You're standing there
(Put out the fire)
I never let go
(Put out the fire)
I let the flames

[Outro]
Nobody waits
Nobody calls anymore
Talking is dead with these fake conversations
Tired nations
Nobody cares too many thoughts at the door
It's all in your head
Cause these days I've awakened
I've been shaken
Here I am
Here I am
Up in flames
Here I am
(go go)
Kendrick Lamar:
What inspired me as a kid really was, uh, illustrating my thoughts on that sheet of paper

Life's to me like a box of chocolates
(?) something for something, that's the obvious
Flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Biting my style, you (?)
Come from the same blocks where they pick cotton
Oh, you forgotten, ah, forget it
That life ain't sane

You see gangbanging, drug paraphernalia. You see things from the streets. So what you gon' do? You gon' find something that you love to do and have a passion for it, or you gon' stay, you  know, mingling in the streets until something major happens

So the moment I defined myself and freed myself was the time I locked myself in the studio and said, "You need to do music."

Tonight's for everybody, understand me
The plan B is the one in your hearts
This here is family, Kendrick Lamar
Words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
Marching on Rosecrans in Compton
You can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
I'm on point like period
I've been there and gone before you get near it
Ooh wee, that boy remind me of a young Martin Luther
The way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters
Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in
That's family, God and honor
From Chicago, my daddy and my momma
Came into Compton to accomplish one thing: reign supreme
Raise a king named Kendrick
I ain't lying, it stand for "King" and I am one
My unborn son and grandson will live royal
From the coochee to the soil
The meek shall inherit the Earth
Well, I've had this world since birth
Feel the good kid's hunger
The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger
But it's muscle in my heart
I stare in the eyes of Mozart and tell him I'm the genius
I love myself, really love myself
And I means this with all sole
And you can't control greatness 'less you hating
With the heart of Satan
But even that can't stop it
I tell 'em, "Get out my wallet and passion in your logic"
Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me
And if you say it ain't, you may offend me
Damn, that boy good
I'm bright as Thomas Edison but I'm Gucci Mane in the hood
I stood alone for so long, prolonged my whole career
But now I'm here, you can shoot shots and cheer
Because I am, we are Kendrick Lamar
Getting into that success level where you can go back to your neighborhood and people feel like, you know, uh, they look up to you. Sometimes the most riskiest things you can do can end up being, you know, the most important. Yeah

Teriq Tyson:
My dream's more vivid than Dr. T's, (?) evolutionary
Reporting live, Centennial High, 2014

Kendrick Lamar:
I am Kendrick. I am Kendrick. I am Kendrick. I am Kendrick
WOODSTOOOCK!
I need y'all to help me greet my dog on the stage!
And when I say DM y'all say X!
DM (X!) DM (X!)
When I say DM y'all say X!
DM (X!) DM (X!)
When I say Ruff y'all say Ryders!
Ruff! (Ryders!) Ruff! (Ryders!)
When I say Ruff y'all say Ryders!
Ruff! (Ryders!) Ruff! (Ryders!)
Where my dogs at? (Crowd barking)
Where my dogs at? (Crowd barking)
Where my dogs at? (Crowd barking)
Where my dogs at? (Crowd barking)
For real
Is that hot enough here for y'all?
I hope not cause we're about to make much motherfuckin hoter!

O-oh!
What have they done noow!
Maybe I should have saved those leftover dreams
Funny but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought
That it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my love so near
Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny that rainy day is here

It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny that rainy day is here

[Hook: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
My mind keep telling me no (telling me no)
My body keep saying I need it
Critics say I'm out of control (out of control)
Cause I'm abusing these drugs and I beat it
But my shoes tied so I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin (I ain't trippin ho)
I got lean and it's killing my kidneys
I got racks that I stack for my children
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, baby
My shoes tied so I ain't trippin, baby
I swear, swear to god, Quan ain't trippin
I can't trip no more bae, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I want to seal it
These bitches wanna fuck us, we the realest
Like it or not, brain shoot to the ceiling
So many clothes in the closet, she looks like dealer
Ran up my racks with Rich Homie we're like the pilgrims
Pour out 4 of that super clean (lean, lean)
I got jelly beans in my billie jeans
I got Quan back cause I know he got my spleen

[Hook: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
My mind keep telling me no (telling me no)
My body keep saying I need it
Critics say I'm out of control (out of control)
Cause I'm abusing these drugs and I beat it

I can't trip no more bae, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Dad told me never trip about no bitch
Daddy told me to stay down and they're gonna lose
Granny told me pray to God, that's what I did
Gotta make a way for my kids
Me and Thug flying higher than a blimp
Eating on shrimp, looking down at the shrimps
If you see me with a limp, don't mistake me for a pimp
The 40 get heavy when you tote it on your hip
Me and Thug ready, going in for the kill
And Imma look confused

[Hook: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
My mind keep telling me no (telling me no)
My body keep saying I need it
Critics say I'm out of control (out of control)
Cause I'm abusing these drugs and I beat it

[Verse 3: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
Got racks on racks on racks
I got zippers on all of my shoes
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin (pussy nigga I wanna be you, psych)
Diamonds black, I'm a walking night
Play with Thugger, scary sight
No shoestrings in these shoes, so I ain't tripping
I ain't worried bout shit, cause I got zippers on all of my shoes

[Hook: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
My mind keep telling me no (telling me no)
My body keep saying I need it
Critics say I'm out of control (out of control)
Cause I'm abusing these drugs and I beat it
But my shoes tied so I ain't trippin

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Is you rollin' up but you don't feel nothin'?
That's a simple conversation
Baby is ya fuckin' with a real one?
That's a simple conversation (x3)
Why these niggas keep hatin'?
That's a simple conversation

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Hop up in the whip, smokin' on the shit, you gon' need ventilation
OG tastin', don't smoke till ya choke, get the dope, don't waste it
I'd rather chill wit' a bad bitch, and see a bitch nigga later
Nah, nigga, I ain't waitin' up, nah nigga, I ain't waitin'
Niggas still hatin', niggas still on the shit
Bitches still on a nigga dick, word to the clique
Every verse like a bird, think I'm servin' a brick
Ya heard me? That's a simple conversation
Leanin' in my ride and smokin' weed up out a paper
Come to Gs, I got a nation, weed and gin, the combination
Need to legalize it!

[Hook]
Is you rollin' up but you don't feel nothin'?
That's a simple conversation
Baby is ya fuckin' with a real one?
That's a simple conversation (x3)
Why these niggas keep hatin'?
That's a simple conversation

[Verse 2: Bankroll Fresh]
Broke ass nigga, stop hatin'
I'm fuckin' hoes off simple conversation
Keep it real, I ain't even gotta say shit
Whip the dick out, make the freak bitch taste it
Gears on the steering wheel, 

[?] race it
Grew up in a spaceship, shot right past
Smellin' like a bag, smokin' out the bag, sunny boy had
So many mothafuckin' hundreds in my hand, flashin'
Baby is ya fuckin' wit' a real one?
All these pussy ass niggas, I'll kill one
I'm in the mothafuckin' trap, vac-sealing
Breaking and rebuilding, snapping and concealing
Keep the heat compressor, straighten up the extra
Bankroll, you goin' hard, you a big flexer
I'm on the phone talkin' money, simple conversation
These broke ass niggas, they still waitin'

[Hook]
Is you rollin' up but you don't feel nothin'?
That's a simple conversation
Baby is ya fuckin' with a real one?
That's a simple conversation (x3)
Why these niggas keep hatin'?
That's a simple conversation

[Verse 3: Reese]
Money talk, talk money, that's a simple conversation
Three cellphones 

[?] nigga, that's how the plug conversatin', aye
My link was juugin' right back cross the nation, aye
I'm fuckin' up money, sometimes you gotta pace it, aye
Live from the bando, my partner operation
SS Camaro, nothin' like a star racin'
I buss on her chin, now she all in my facial
Hot sauce, I need a pay-cation
It could all be so simple, that's a little conversatin'
My niggas ain't bluffin' wit' you, that choppa gon' erase ya!

[Verse 1]
And I'm in denial
And it don't take no x-ray to see right through my smile
Oh no
I be on the go
But there ain't no drink out there that can numb my soul
Oh no
Uh

[Chorus]
All we wan' do is take the chains off
All we wan' do is break the chains off, yeah
All we wan' do is be free
All we wan' do is be free
All we wan' do is take the chains off
All we wan' do is break the chains off, yeah
All we wan' do is be free
All we wan' do is be free

[Verse 2]
Can you tell me why
Every time I step outside I see my people die?
Oh, I
I'm lettin' you know
That there ain't no gun they make that can kill my soul
Oh no

[Chorus]
All we wan' do is take the chains off
All we wan' do is break the chains off, yeah
All we wan' do is be free
All we wan' do is be free
All we wan' do is take the chains off
All we wan' do is break the chains off, yeah
All we wan' do is be free
All we wan' do is be free

[Verse 3]
Yeah
Forget this chain, 'cause this ain't me
Though I'm eternally grateful to Jay Z
We so elated, we celebrated like Obama waited until his last day in office
To tell the nation, "Brothers is getting they reparations, hey!"
A man can dream, can't he?
No disrespect, in terms of change I haven't seen any
Maybe he had good intentions but was stifled by the system
And was sad to learn that he actually couldn't bring any
That's what I get for thinking, this world is fair
They let a brother steer the ship and never told him that the ship was sinkin'
But I got other shit to think about
Like my bank account
Forget that watch, you paid too much for it, you oughta be ashamed
When brothers back home be dreading when the seasons change
'Cause they ain't got no heat and they ain't got no AC
WalMart distribution fired my homie, he just had a baby
You wonder why it's been so many B and E's lately
While brothers from the hood shooting like this is TNT lately
And since all the ballers leaving college early
I turn on the TV and don't see no brothers with degrees lately

[Bridge]
Are we all alone
Fighting on our own?
Please give me a chance
I don't wanna dance
Something's got me down
I will stand my ground
Don't just stand around
Don't just stand around

[Outro]
All we wan' do is be free
All we wan' do is be free
All we wan' do is take the chains off

[Intro: Young Thug]
Umm (Never made love, never made love)
I'm sorry, you know that
I can't even explain it 'cause I'm wrong (Never made love, never made love, ayy)
So, ahem

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
She caught me creepin' with my old ho
She ran up like "yeah, yeah," I was like "no, no"
My lookout man was my right hand but he was wrong, though
Then I seen some diamonds come off of my neighbor's porch
And it was her, she had a Louis Vuitton purse clean as detergent
She had the same exact face as my brother's nurse
And he in a hearse, I never looked at it for what it's worth

[Chorus: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
So I never made love, never made love (Ayy)
Never made love, never made love (Ayy)
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love (Never made)
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never ever ever ever made love
Never made love, never made love
I ain't never made love (Ayy)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Never made love, never made love (Ayy)
When she open up, I'ma taste her (Try)
X out everyone and then erase her (Ayy)
I'm sorry for lyin' to your face, yeah (Sorry)
I'ma marry her and I bouquet her (Ayy)
Leavin' out the house drunk and she stumbles (Woah)
Be all on her mind, she can't even think of (Drunk)
She walkin' off, I look at her like cable (Ayy)
Boolin' with your partners at a party, ayy (Fuckin' round)
They don't even know what the fuck love means, ayy (They gon' fuck with me)
She say she never waste time on me (Ahh)
Yeah that came out of your jaws, baby (I heard it)
I heard it, even though I suck it 'til she lockin' up (Ayy)
Lockin' up like handcuffs
Give me all your time, every day (Woo)
Girl how come we never made love at your spot? (Why?)
Cause you ain't want your other rich homie be findin' out (Ayy)
She want it so I spent twelve thousand on a lil' rug (Racks)
I'm just tryna tell you, ain't tryna make you look low

[Chorus: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
Even though you've never made love, never made love (Ayy)
Never made love, never made love, never made love (Ayy)
She never made love, never made love (Ayy)
Never made love, never ever ever (Never made love, ayy)
She never made love, never made love
Never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made
Never felt love, never felt love
Never made love, never made love, never made love

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Well I'ma change that there
I just might wake up and buy you everything rare (Woo)
I'm not cheatin' on you no more, I don't care (Swear to God)
You wanna be with me, I'ma roll the dice now (Roll it)
Roll it, I buy a Rollie, I'ma buy that bitch a Rollie (Roll it)
That pack keep rollin', I'ma buy that bitch some more shit
'Cause I fucked her sister then I fucked on all her cousins
Bitch, I'm a Blood, you know I fucked on your bousins
She smiling in your face, but tellin' me she love it (Ayy)
She like the way my pants don't sag even though they're stuffy (Racks)
She won't T.I. on me, she don't care 'bout no money (Sorry)
Hey, hey (Swear to God)
Wait, wait, don't leave (Ayy)
Hey, hey (Swear to God, baby)
Ayy, ayy, hey (I love you like 

[?], baby)

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
They trip out all the time, tellin' you I'm on some bullshit
Parallel parkin' that pussy, they like my motion (Skrrt)
Put that on my mama, now Stunna know that I'm loaded (Loaded)
When my partner see it he stand up like he on Folgers (Woo)
I ain't like that shit so I hit him right in his shit
Then I told him, "Don't ever do that shit there again" (What?)
How you feel if I see your ho and fuck on the kid? (What?)
I'ma catch a body if she leave me, I'm not playin'
Yes, I said I'm the best and I put that on the red
When you make me mad I tried to get back and get some head
And I know that's wrong, but my dumbass still did it instead
Then I put the strap to my own head like boy I'm on one, woah
Then I told her don't ever do it again (Uh huh)
Every guy you look at, I'll turn him to wind (Ayy)
Yeah, then I looked up at God like yeah

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug]
Then I realized I'd never made love, never made love (Woo)
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
She never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
She never ever made love
I swear to God I never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Hey, never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love

[Intro: Mary J. Blige]
Oooh, ooh, oh, oh
Oooh, ooh, oh, oh
Oooh, ooh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
They said I’d never be a leader
They said I’d never wear a crown
If I wanted to be someone
I should learn to settle down

[Pre-Chorus 1: Mary J. Blige]
You should know better
I tell myself
You’ll never go further
I warned myself
You’ll never be better
Don’t know me that well

[Chorus 1: Mary J. Blige]
I made it to the end
I nearly paid the cost
I lost a lot of friends
I sacrificed a lot
I’d do it all again
Cause I made it to the top
But I can’t keep doubting myself anymore
No, ooh, oh, oh
No, ooh, oh, oh
I can’t keep doubting myself, no (ooh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Now you’re looking at a leader
Now you’re staring at a queen
You’d said I’d never be someone
But now I’m pulling those strings

[Pre-Chorus 2: Mary J. Blige]
You should know better
Won’t make me back down
You’ll never go further
Can’t turn me around
You’ll never be better
So no stopping me now

[Chorus 2: Mary J. Blige]
I made it to the end
I nearly paid the cost
I lost a lot of friends
I sacrificed a lot
I’d do it all again
Cause I made it to the top
I can’t keep doubting myself anymore
No, no, no, no, ooh, oh, oh
No, ooh, oh, oh
No, ooh, oh, oh

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
You think you know
But you don’t know the half
You think you beat me down
But I’ll have the last laugh
I’ll keep getting up
Cause that’s what I want to do
I’m gonna be the best me
I’m sorry if it kills you

[Chorus 2: Mary J. Blige]
I made it to the end
I nearly paid the cost
I lost a lot of friends
I sacrificed a lot
I’d do it all again
Cause I made it to the top
I can’t keep doubting myself anymore
Oooh, no, ooh, no, no, no
I can’t keep doubting myself , no, no
(Oooh, oh, oh)

[Spoken Verse: Sam Smith]
And I remember holding The Breakthrough album
Holding it in my hands, in my car
Listening to it on repeat
To me she was this untouchable goddess
And, and when I met her
I really, really wasn't expecting her
To just be, like me
I feel like we're, we're so similar

[Chorus: Maya Jane Coles]
You know, don't you?
Yeah
Night of
You know, don't you?
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about it, talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a muhfucka
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you a undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other (Woo)
Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it

[Chorus: Maya Jane Coles]
You know, don't you?
Yeah
Night of
You know, don't you?

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, thinkin' out loud
I must have about a milli on me right now
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair right now?
Uhh, do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch if you dare me
I ain't never need a man to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it

[Chorus: Maya Jane Coles]
You know, don't you?
Yeah
Night of
You know, don't you?
Yeah
Night of

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, thinkin' out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank, check in my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low, you ain't gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning, cause she gon' say "I know"
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub, girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But, bitch, you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? — Not important
I brought some cocaine if you snortin'
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off, white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless, and flawless
Smallest, regardless, largest in charge
And born in New Orleans, get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly, Drake, Tunechi, and Barbie
You know!

[Chorus: Maya Jane Coles]
You know, don't you?
Yeah
Night of
You know, don't you?
Yeah
Night of

[Verse 1]
From up above I heard
The angels sing to me these words
And sometimes, in your eyes
I see the beauty in the world

[Chorus]
Oh, now I'm floating so high
I blossom and die
Send your storm and your lightning to strike
Me between the eyes
Eyes

[Verse 2]
Sometimes the stars decide
To reflect in puddles in the dirt
When I look in your eyes
I forget all about what hurts

[Chorus]
Oh, now I'm floating so high
I blossom and die
Send your storm and your lightning to strike
Me between the eyes
And cry
(Believe in miracles)

[Outro]
Oh hey, I'm floating up above the world now
Oh hey, I'm floating up above the world now
Oh, yeah yeah yeah

The Idler Wheel is wiser than the Driver of the Screw
And Whipping Cords will serve you more than Ropes will ever do

[Verse 1]
Seems like we were right
But you always have a problem with everything
Appreciate your advice
But sometimes I have trouble managing
Now that I'm paying attention
I see how beautiful you are
But when you spend so much time together
That image can get so dark

[Chorus]
When you're gone
I miss you like I did when we were first together
No one in this world could ever hold me better
Just tell me when you're coming home
When you're gone
I miss you like you took a piece of me with ya
Didn't think I'd care that much did ya?
Just tell me when you're coming home

[Verse 2]
Seems like we were right
But today I woke up on the wrong side
I need silence to keep me right
Otherwise today won't be nice
I wanna laugh with you again
Just like you are my best friend
But friends can always leave
And we're too close
And too close is never easy

[Chorus]
When you're gone
I miss you like I did when we were first together
No one in this world could ever hold me better
Just tell me when you're coming home
When you're gone
I miss you like you took a piece of me with ya
Didn't think I'd care that much did ya?
Just tell me when you're coming home

[Bridge]
I'm not alone
Until you leave me
Now I won't get to sleep tonight
Cause you're not here beside me
When you're away
It's never easy
You make it all alright
I miss you

[Chorus]
When you're gone
I miss you like I did when we were first together
No one in this world could ever hold me better
Just tell me when you're coming home
When you're gone
I miss you like you took a piece of me with ya
Didn't think I'd care that much did ya?
Just tell me when you're coming home

And then once you add Jimmy and Sam into the equation to write melodies and songs
It's like, yeah, power team
It's just good timing as well, you know?
She's just ready to it, that's what it is
She doesn't need to do this, look she wants to and its great, you know

[Spoken dialogue: Guy Lawrence of Disclosure]
It's the reason people like Mary are so successful
Is that, they're just, they're not afraid to just change what they do completely

[Verse 1]
Some hope for the future
Some wait for the call
To say that the days ahead
Will be the best of all

[Refrain]
We will build bridges
Up to the sky
Heavenly lights surrounding
You and I

[Verse 2]
From out of the darkness
Our future will come
If we leave the past behind
We'll fly beyond the sun

[Refrain]
We'll be together
Sharing the load
Watching in wonder as our lives unfold

[Bridge]
Hope for the future
It's coming soon enough
How much can we achieve?
Hope for the future
It will belong to us
If we believe
If we believe

Hope shines brightest in the dark
When nothing's ever seen
Lighting undiscovered places
No-ones ever been

[Verse 1]
Some hope for the future
Some wait for the call
To say that our destiny
Will be the best of all

[Refrain]
And we will build bridges
Up to the sky
And heavenly lights
Surrounding you and I

[Bridge]
Hope shines brightest in the dark
Where nothing's ever seen
Lighting undiscovered places
No-one's ever been

[Outro]
Hope for the future
Hope for the future
Hope for the future

[Verse 1]
Oh my sun it won't shine
It won't light up the back of my mind
And these fires they won't burn
But to blacken the memories I've earned

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And these walls are so thin
But they somehow keep holding me in
'Cause I've pushed and I know
What's to come at the end of this road

[Hook]
'Cause it goes through, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Well, my sun it won't shine
It won't light up the back of my mind
And these fires they don't burn
Except to blacken the memories I've earned

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And these walls are so thin
But they keep on holding me in
'Cause I've pushed and I know
That there's nowhere left to go

[Hook (x2)]
'Cause it goes through, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Instrumental]

[Hook (x2)]
'Cause it goes through, ooh

[Verse 1]
This is the first line here
This is the first line again
Watch as it disappears
I know the last line
The last line will never pull me in

[Verse 2]
This is the next line here
This is the next line again
You can forget that I'm here
As if the last line
The last line is slowly closing in

[Verse 3]
This is the last line here
This is the last line again
Watch as I disappear
And the last line
The flat line that goes here at the end

[Verse]
Landing in the Devil's drop
I walked out in the snow
And climbed up to the mountain top
A push from death below

Brother fell protecting us
Somewhere far from home
Lay him down to rest with us
In fields of earth and coal

Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa

[Bridge]
Sailing out away from this
To ports of foreign shores
Let us not forget to miss
The ones we cannot hold

Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa

[Verse]
Landing in the Devil's drop
I walked out in the snow
And climbed up to the mountain top
A push from death below

Brother fell protecting us
Somewhere far from home
Lay him down to rest with us
In fields of earth and coal

[Intro]
(Shit!)
Hahaha
Tim Curry mixed
Niggas hold it down
We One Umbrella nigga

It's ours nigga
(Mike WiLL Made-It)

[Verse]
Now I heard word around the road is niggas wanna murder me
Pull up in the spot with that fire like it's work for me
'Cause I can murder niggas without going on a murder spree
'Cause I sold so much hoes the dream that they'll go out and murk for free
I told that cash I see that though
You soft but I can't see that low
She say she want my kid I say "Bitch, you must be La Vida Lo"
Niggas talking down but I'm not 'round 'cause I can't be that broke
I talk this cash, she walk that ass, I bought that bag, I need that ho
I told 'em
These niggas talking money but they never had
I'm back to putting carats in the whip, and rapping, niggas spend a hundred on a shoe to put them in the cask'
I ain't doing talking dog just make it happen
I keep a bitch that's cool enough to make me happy
I take that pussy from her then I take a nap, a hundred bunch of bullets waiting for you and your favorite rapper
These niggas started whipping all yola
But nigga that don't mean you a soldier
Even if the codeine in your soda
I would've tripped a dope Beemer and stole her
Listen, you muhfuckers couldn't match a nigga hustle, your shawty rushing, jerking, sucking to catch a nigga coming
You know, young fella, I'm Umbrella, and to these chicks a nigga dick a number one seller
Young telling these women to cum, some yelling they dribble they tongue, while swallowing cum, I'm villain that's drilling them dumb
Uh, I get that vanilla filling I'm done
I'm the one, I get that feeling from drilling your hun
Getting some, burning bitches like I'm sitting in the Sun
Show a nigga some, do it like you owe a nigga some
Hoes getting dumb, panties on you know I'm getting numb
Load a nigga drum, blow it till you know a nigga cum
Uh, I kill a motherfucker on the beat
Hit it like the bitch done got me fucking on repeat
I told her go and get it like she fucking on the street
'Cause she know a nigga in it like I'm stuck up underneath
Oh, a nigga balling
All Globetrotter niggas, new Louis, can't fuck with my old ho Prada
Cash nigga, you can see me with a rose gold bottle
Fashion nigga, I might fuck her with a Polo condom, nigga
Hold up
Who the fuck told them they were soldiers?
When I was 14 I was homeless
Now I'm richer than a bitch and now the owner
Young thug and my chain is a stoner
With a blood plug and the plate stolen
And that pussy, that shit mine
Might as well tat' a young nigga name on it
You say you from the dot nigga, you ain't seen us seeing, nigga
Put me on the spot, said my dick, she won't see it, nigga
Niggas talking down but they really wanna be him, nigga
It's that flying foreign, young nigga Argentina, nigga
Canada!
(Shit!)
Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high

If I had a day that I could give you
I'd give to you the day just like today
If I had a song that I could sing for you
I'd sing a song to make you feel this way

Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high

If I had a tale that I could tell you
I'd tell a tale sure to make you smile
If I had a wish that I could wish for you
I'd make a wish for sunshine for all the while

Sunshine on my shoulders makes me happy
Sunshine in my eyes can make me cry
Sunshine on the water looks so lovely
Sunshine almost always makes me high
Sunshine almost all the time makes me high
Sunshine almost always
I don't want you gone
That was once you calling
Just to check up on me

I could make it by
Now she's got me falling
And soon I will be nothing

You know she wants to help
She's gonna be there for you

You say I never take for anyone
Maybe I don't but I hate the taste

I slowly started fading
But now I'm feeling better

Got blinded in two places
But found out which one mattered

You know you aren't gonna have her long
They're gonna leave you too

[Narration: Beyoncé]

I sometimes wish I could just be anonymous and walk down the street just like everyone else
Before I was famous I was the girl on the heel with the guitar
I was the girl who just wanted a beautiful view of the beach
And now that I'm famous, it's really really difficult to do very simple things
I think it's the hardest thing to give up
But my mother always taught me to be strong and to never be a victim, never make excuses, never expect anyone else to provide for me things I know I can provide for myself
I have dreams, and I feel like I have a power to actually make those dreams a reality
When you're famous no one looks at you as a human anymore, you become the property of the public
There's nothing real about it

Just look at these dazzling women
The finest representatives of our nation
Ready to reach for the stars and grab the crown

You can't put your finger on who I am
I can't put my finger on who I am
I am complicated
I grew up with a lot of conflict, and drama's, and I've been through a lot just like everyone else
My escape was always music and I'm so lucky that that's my job
But if I accomplished all of these things and had no one to share with, it would be worth nothing
You know, you need something real in order for any of this stuff to matter
You have to have something that is forever
Something that's invisible
I was brought up seeing my mother try to please and make everyone comfortable
And I always felt like it was my job to fix the problem
People pleaser, but I'm no longer afraid of conflict and I don't think conflict is a bad thing
Because I know that when you grow up, when you learn a few things , you're no longer afraid of letting go, you're no longer afraid of the unknown
You're no longer afraid of going to certain places in your body and your mind and your soul that may make you feel uncomfortable
And it all starts with if you could look at yourself in the mirror and say "I like that person," you know?
If I hadn't gone through, you know, some of the painful experiences in my life, I would not be me
And I feel like my body is borrowed and this life is very temporary
I watched my friends body deteriorate and to see some one pass on so gracefully put everything into perspective
We do not value ourselves enough
Especially young people don't really appreciate how brilliant our bodies are
I've always been very very specific and very choosy, very choosy about what I do with my body and who I want to share that with
People feel like they lose something when they get married but it doesn't have to be that way
There's nothing more exciting than having a witness to your life
I always considered myself a feminist, although I was always afraid of that word because people put so much on it
When, honestly, it's very simple
It's just when, you know, a person that believes in equality for men and women
Men and women balance each other out, and we have to get to a point where we are comfortable with appreciating each other
I have a lot of empathy for men, and the pressures that they go through and the cultures that have been created, especially for African-American men
I have the same empathy for women, and the pressures we go through
The woman has to provide so many things for their children
I consider myself a humanist

You know, everybody's not good at everything
You know, it's OK to depend on someone
It's actually what we're supposed to do
We're supposed to depend on each other
And when you find the person that you trust and you love
And you feel is going to respect you and take all of the shit you have and turn it around and bring out the best in you and feed you
It is the most powerful thing you can feel in your life
Happiness comes from you
No one else can make you happy
You make you happy
And one thing that's for sure:
The love I have for music, for my husband, for my child,
Is something that will last far beyond my life

[Verse]
He never was too kind
He never would apologize
For it to turn out how it did
Isn't understood
Keep standing where you stand

I'm getting behind
I think I'll die
Before I'm done
Done

[Instrumental Fade]
Errrr, here we go again
Uh, un-hunh
Uh, un-hunh
Uh, un-hunh
Yeah, yo Kiss

I only gave you the crown so I could shoot it off your fuckin head
Yall niggas fuckin dead, you heard what the fuck I said
I talk shit cause I walk shit, start shit, New York shit
The hawk shit, spark shit, the dark shit
And it been that way, fuck how a nigga live it's gon' end that way
Niggas is part of a game that I don't play
Never catch dog carrying what I don't weigh
That's three 45s, one 38, 173 pounds straight out the gate
I don't hate, got no beef but knock a nigga off quick
And I'm mad like a bitch and a nigga with a soft dick
Get off this, fucking with X, but on some other shit
Why the fuck you fucking with X? You must be fucking with X
Go catch a chicken, fucking with me you gon' catch a whippen
Un-hunh, here we go again
Un-hunh, here we go again

Look don't try to apologize on your two way
Sympathy don't amuse me, go get your uzi
And let's make a real movie
Play bad guy and good guy til the hood die
Toast yall cowards
Now I know the reason why Pac ain't really like most yall cowards
Im'a show you how to swing the chrome for real
Dog this year we gon' bring it home for real
What you wanna bet the llama'll squash you
I been had a white fan base before the signing of Marshall
Boy Kiss is thorough, hit your girl
Put it all up her stomach til she earl
Yall niggas ain't nice ya lucky
So fuck it Im'a sell dope long as the price is lovely
And it ain't only the voice it's the bars of death

Un-hunh, here we go again
Un-hunh, here we go again
Un-hunh, here we go again
Un-hunh, here we go again

Un-hunh, here we go again

When is they getting off our dicks, them niggas is clowns
How many dogs you let go up, still getting down
Like 'face said, last of a dying breed
For stomach and I feed still trying to eat
Lead by greed that's when you fuck up
Yall niggas gonna know when we hungry, you get stuck up
(What what?) What's up? Fuck a nigga yelling
Y-O motherfucker for real, yo 'Kiss tell 'em

Shoot to kill, stomp niggas out boot to grill
I'll give you a reason why I'm "The Truth" for real
Niggas can't fuck with Kiss, I mean that
Had to stop eating red meat cause I ate too many Beanie-Macs
I'm not one of them niggas and since you so richeous
Don't make me send your ass to Ala quicker
Niggas gas you to force your hand
Realistically you just a worker and your boss is my man
Un-hunh, here we go again
Un-hunh, here we go again
Un-hunh, here we go again
Un-hunh, here we go again
Un-hunh, here we go again

Un-hunh, here we go again
And away we go (we go we go we go)
Some old born loser type of shit (shit)
On the remix tip (tip, tip)
Dr. Seuss (Seuss Seuss Suess)

The Born Loser, not because I choose to be
But because all the bad shit happens to me
I got kids, but their mothers don't want them to know me
Sisters use to like me, but now they call me homie
Use to have a family now I'm out on my own
Had to scrap with the Pitt, cause I tried to take his bone
Bitches don't like me, they don't kiss me or hug me
They call me Kill-pretty, because I'm mad ugly
I use to get pussy, but I busted off quick
Now I gets none, so I gotta beat my dick
Time are hard in the ghetto, I steal for a living
Eatin turkey flavored Now or Laters for thanksgiving
If that ain't enough, life is rough, I swear
I don't have an address so I can't get welfare
They kicked me out the shelter
Because they said I smelled a little like the living dead
And look like helter skelter
My clothes are so funky, they bad for my health
Sometimes at night my pants go to the bathroom by their self
Even when I was little nothin went my way
I got beat up, and chased home from school every day
And despite the fact I won all the spelling bees
On my report card, I didn't get F's, I got C's
But for those who choose to snooze
Since I was born with no hope, I ain't got nothin to lose...
Young man went out and made a name for himself
Young man went out and made a name for himself
Young man went out and made a name for himself

Check check check it out

Verse 2

The Born Loser, a title I was branded with
Went to Liberty Island, and got stranded with
The Statue of Liberty, but they really didn't hafta
Leave my black ass there till the day after
No time for laughter, this shit's for real
Ribs are showin through my back, cause I haven't had a meal
In about a week, you can see bones in my hands
The racoons, beat me to the garbage cans
I'm Starvin Marvin, and it shouldn't be like that
The only thing that I'm carvin, is an alley cat
But sometimes in the daytime
I daydream of a Manwich
When all I'm really eatin is an oxygen sandwich
For those that don't know
Thats 2 peices of bread slapped together
Or I'll have a rain sandwich, depending on the weather
Born loser, caught up in the game
And I ain't even got nobody to blame..
Young man went out and made a name for himself
Young man went out and made a name for himself
Young man went out and made a name for himself

The Born Loser, yeah, that use to be my m o
When I couldn't get a soul, to listen to my demo
Doors shut in my face, until I started jammin 'em
I'm behind the doors now, but I'm the one slammin 'em
I did what I had to, to get where I got
Though I'll admit, what I had to do was a lot
I still gave it a shot, and sometimes I had to shoot
Catchin vicks just to get a little loot
I thought it was cute, and didn't care who knew
Mess around get in my way and I'd bag you too
Cause I was, born to lose, straight from the beginning
Hit the dugout, because I struck out the 1st inning
Winning, was everything, thats why I had to ask
My man to front me the loot, and he said I'd be glad to
Now, who needs a major label, we got our own
I'm the divine master of the unknown
Ain't nothin changed, I'm the same as before
When opportunity knocks, I'd just answer the door
But criminal at heart, even though I don't show it
I was always a winner I just didn't know it (know it)

Young man went out and made a name for himself
Young man went out and made a name for himself
Young man went out and made a name for himself
Born Loser

[Intro]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Call me Miami haro haro, cause this deals with the track
Blows my mind like oh chea
Yeah, that's wrong, but it's real
Fuck boys they know the deal
Pit done started a revolution
Now all they wanna do is follow, follow, but chill
I went from tia servin me meals to makin a meal
So fuck with your deals, talk is cheap so fuck a grill
Miami got them boys that's real, trill
Now full of, gold, grills, sell steel
But only God knows that they kill bill
You can tell them boys is rookies
When they make it rain in the club
You know them boys is rookies
When they got a hundred ones under dub
I love it when they think they big time
But they just servin cookies
And I love it when they think they from the hood
And they just surburban pussies
I'm off in the sky boxing tootsies, with Pepe
Knock chasin' pussies, just lookin for investors
To back up this movement we pushin
I ain't comfortable so everything I make is kushin'
And every day comes nothin but stockin with sushi

[Chorus]
It's cool you flip birds, don't bring that shit around me

[Verse 2]
Dime con quien tu van da, y te digo quien tu eres
Pitbull el rapero, pero negociante Armando Perez
I rap for them low key boys, get money, no keys
And thanks to this rap shit
I don't gotta hear nothin' bout' no keys boy
But it's like everywhere I go
Everybody pull up low by the boatloads (woah)
Then they get on records and rap about the shit
And cold like the dead don't know
These boys need to wake up and smell the cocaine
Cause this a different day and age in the rap game
Cause the feds, cabs, bobs
Wise they'll listen to everything that we say
You can deny it until you get federally indicted
Accounts frozen and family just put on a diet
Them big boys that push heavy weight know I ain't lyin
I'm tryin to blow til the point I can tell Donald Trump
"You fired." I did what I had to do to get where I'm at
I push a little this, I push a little that
But now that the game has let me in I ain't never goin back
And man you can bet that
Havin problems movin weight?
Man, I wish I could help, but rap is my meal ticket
So keep them bricks to yourself

[Chorus]
It's cool you flip birds, don't bring that shit around me
(guilt-guilty by association)
I heard you were snitches so don't come around me
(guilt-guilty by association)
I heard you talkin lick, don't talk that shit around me

[Verse 1]
Boys marching to war
To certain defeat
They were younger than me

Guns poke through the trees
Death on a limb
They were aiming at him

[Hook 1]
And when the bullets came, he didn't duck
He wrapped her pantyhose around his neck

And he could feel their magic working
Keeping him from harm
Away to some place mystical and warm
His lucky charm

[Verse 2]
He got caught
No cover at all
He'd breathe in her scent
Not even a scratch
He didn't die
When he stepped on a mine
They were violet and soft
It didn't go off

[Hook 2]
And when her letter came he didn't cry
He wrapped her pantyhose around his eyes

And he could feel their magic working
Keeping him from harm
Even though she didn't love him anymore

You can't kill a lucky charm

[Chorus]
You fill up my senses, like a night in a forest
Like the mountains in springtime, like a walk in the rain
Like a storm in the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean
You fill up my senses, come fill me again

[Verse]
Come let me love you, let me give my life to you
Let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms
Let me lay down beside you, let me always be with you
Come let me love you, come love me again

(Let me give my life to you
Come let me love you, come love me again)

[Chorus]
You fill up my senses, like a night in a forest
Like the mountains in springtime, like a walk in the rain
Like a storm in the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean
You fill up my senses, come fill me again

[Verse 1]
I got the key to the highway, yeah
Billed out and bound to go
I gotta keep walking this highway
Walking most too slow
I eat my breakfast in California
I eat my dinner in Caroline
Woo, I’m gonna keep on
Keep on walking this highway, yeah
'Til I reach the end of the line
Walk on, yeah

[Verse 2]
Show the movie, yeah
Lordy mama keeps on shining, shining
And the good, good, good Lord, heavens above
Everybody know, life ain't, ain't worth livin'
If you ain’t with the one you love
So trouble in mind, yeah
Lordy mama I’m blue, yeah
And I won’t, I won’t, I won’t be blue always
Oh yeah, the sun gon' shine
Sun gonna shine in my backdoor
Some on rainy day, oh yeah

[Verse 1:]
It's cold here in the city
It always seems that way
And I've been thinking
About you almost everyday

Thinking about the good times
Thinking about the rain
Thinking about how bad it feels alone again

[Chorus:]
I'm sorry
For the way things are in China
I'm sorry
Things ain't what they used to be
But more than anything else
I'm sorry for myself
'Cause you're not here with me

[Verse 2:]
Our friends all ask about you
I say you're doing fine
And I expect to hear
From you almost anytime
But they all know I'm crying
And I can't sleep at night
They all know I'm dying down deep inside

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Instrumental Break:]

[Chorus:]
I'm sorry
If I took some things for granted
I'm sorry
For the chains I put on you

But more than anything else
I'm sorry for myself
For living without you

It's cold here in the city
It always seems that way
And I've been thinking about you almost every day

[Intro]
Thugger
Y'all got me (fucked up)

[Verse]
Now I've been red since i look like Robin Hood
They been hating on me cuttin my cable cords
They gon' hate on her when she come Michael Kors
Meanwhile you bitch in his 'lac grippin' his wood

Always I gotta stand her
No, she dont want nobody to eat but her
She be like fuck them digits, stack them digits
Complement this Findi fit
Condiments no cinnamon though
She ride three deep with molly in the middle
Put Mickey Thompsons all on my jeep
Ain't got no handprints on my doors they all on my seat
10 thousand dollar toe ring, featured by E!
Time out
They be fucking me so good I be like time out
They want to fuck me 'til I tell them all the time out
Meanwhile she stroke it I can't coach it, I'm like time out

Now I'ma show 'em
Her poesy beat me by three I call her Reggie Miller
She roll my weed in giant 'gars she tall like 'zilla
I want ya
Baby don't you work me you know I wanna
She down with slime, she got her tights up in that new condo
Thugger getting high in London
Bitches walking around naked no pajamas
Lil homie red, dog, fellat' this lumber
For that I'ma fuck ya aunt, ya sis, ya mama
We pop a bean together
She wanna feel just like I feel, we growing wings together
Everything perfect about her, can't get my theme together
I turn her up and we then shit on earthlings together
Get girls like Mykko Montana
(?) I got stamina
I'm geeked on the Hannah Montana-nana
I bury these hoes like sandals
I kill everyone of my features
I spend all my money on beepers
My pockets on yellow pages, just like a beeper

[Hook: Jason Aldean]
When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go
When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I done took all I could take from you
Need a little bit more than a break from you
Matter of fact fuck you, don't need you in my life
You done did so much wrong I hope you get it right
But not at my expense, I did all I could do
You just took me for granted, you thought I was a fool
When I did everything in my power to help and please you
But I don't know you no more, fuck it, I caught amnesia
Too many emotions I try to bury
But the higher I climb, the less weight I'm trying to carry
Dem niggas holdin' on for dear life, bringin' me drama
But I'm only responsible for my daughters Cai and Karma
Nigga you's a grown man, get yourself together
Forget about the past, now's a better time than never
Matter of fact, It's time to start making better decisions
So put your fires out, and stop burning 'Cris' bridges
You little bitches

[Hook: Jason Aldean]
When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Yeah, this industry's full of bullshitters
And all this time you thought you had me fooled niggas
In my ferrari partner thought he saw a spaceship
Cos I move in speed not to get caught up in this fake shit
Smiling in my face when I'm around y'all
But soon as I leave, niggas be prayin' on my down fall
Is it cause you'll never sell as many records?
My bitches always look better, you fail at business endeavours?
Or that people thought you were clever, but now they know you stupid?
And misery loves company now that you're going through it?
Somebody tell these rappers I walk hard in these Louis
So get out of here, you don't want no part of this shit, Dewey
I see them drugs got y'all trippin' too soon
That's why you find me in the club, every once in a blue moon
So while you contemplate making your first million
I'll be somewhere contemplating on making my first billion
And then, trillion

[Hook: Jason Aldean]
When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
The biggest mistake we make as individuals
Is thinking everyone lives by the same principles
But when I talk by the same teachers and principals
For you to know it's not the money, it's the principle
So I can't expect you to know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Our issues are deep within, we can't just talk 'em out
Niggas is fighting inside, we can't just walk 'em out
These bridges burning so fast, we can't just stomp 'em out
As if you know what I'm talkin' 'bout

[Hook: Jason Aldean]
When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go

[Verse]
Well, people don't see
What I see
Even when they're right there
Standing next to me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And all of my friends think I'm crazy
For loving you
What they don't know
There's nothing else I can do

[Chorus]
And it's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, it's too bad)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, so bad)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, it don't matter, baby)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, so sad)

[Verse]
See, people don't know
What I know
They say I'm losing my mind
I know I'm losing control
Hey

[Pre-Chorus 2]
All of my friends think I'm crazy
But I don't care
I'm over the edge, no turning back
Belong to you, I swear, aye

[Chorus]
And it's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, it's too bad)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, so bad)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, it don't matter, baby)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, so sad)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind

[Bridge]
Yeah (Oh, oh, ooh-oh)
Yeah (Oh, oh, ooh-oh)
Yeah (Oh, oh, ooh-oh)
Yeah (Oh, oh, ooh-oh)

[Chorus]
And it's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, it's too bad)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, so bad)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, it don't matter, baby)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind
(It's too bad, so sad)
It's too bad 'cause love is blind

[Bridge]
Yeah (Oh, oh)
Yeah (Oh, oh)

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
So I met this young lady, ya know, when I went back home. I was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like *snaps*. I said "You know what, girl? You crazy." Then she asked me what he said...

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings]
(What did the Asian say?) "A peace of mind"
That's what the Asian said—I need a divine
Intervention was his religion and I was surprised
Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God
Asked him what are you doing, he said "taking my time"
Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try
See you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career, you ever think of your health?

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings]
(What did the Indian say?) "A piece of land"
That's what the Indian said—I needed the man
Telling me longevity is in the dirt
Should buy some property first
Should profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best, really, you should invest
These tangible things expire, don't you expect
Income with so much outcome and yes
Look at my heritage, we blessed

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings]
(Now, what the black man say?) "A piece of pussy"
That's what the black man said I needed to push me
To the limit, to satisfy my hunger
We do it all for a woman from haircut to a war
We like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach
What you saying to me?
He said "nigga, come back to reality for a week"
Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night
I wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar & Mani Strings]
(What the white man say?) A piece of mine's
That's what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99
If I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine
What if I compromise? He said it don't even matter
You make a million or more, you living better than average
You losing your core following, gaining it all
He put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
"Look at what you accomplishing"; what he said to the boy
"I'ma make you some promises that you just can't ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist if I don't target your market
If you ain't signing your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
Your world tour, your master's, mortgage, I need a piece"

[Saxophone Interlude: Terrace Martin]

[Hook: Bilal]
I holler, "What you do? What you say?"
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today
I holler, "What you do? What you say?"
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today

[Outro]
What the black man say?
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply

[Intro]
I'ma care for you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you

[Verse 1]
You make it look like it's magic (Oh, yeah)
'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm never confused
Hey, hey
And I'm so used to bein' used

[Pre-Chorus]
So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause girl, you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause girl, you earned it, yeah
Girl, you earned it, yeah

[Verse 2]
You know our love would be tragic (Oh, yeah)
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind, mind, mind
We live with no lies
Hey, hey
You're my favorite kind of night

[Pre-Chorus]
So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause girl, you're perfect (Girl, you're perfect)
You're always worth it (Always worth it)
And you deserve it (And you deserve it)
The way you work it (The way you work it)
'Cause girl, you earned it, yeah (Earned it)
Girl, you earned it, yeah

[Bridge]
On that lonely night (Lonely night)
We said it wouldn't be love
But we felt the rush (Fell in love)
It made us believe it was only us (Only us)
Convinced we were broken inside, yeah, inside, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause girl, you're perfect (Girl, you're perfect)
You're always worth it (You're always worth it)
And you deserve it (And you deserve it)
The way you work it (The way you work it)
'Cause girl, you earned it, yeah (You earned it)
Girl, you earned it, yeah (You earned it)

[Outro]
Na-na-na-na-na
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah
'Cause girl, you're perfect
The way you work it
You deserve it
Girl, you deserve it
Girl, you earned it, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Back when I was a kid I used to drive alone
Always feeling like I was stuck out here on my own
Now my pockets is full and I'm still riding slow
What goes on in my head, don't nobody really know
I'm in the light, all on my life get put on display
Nothing to call my own, ducking, dodging everyday
Put that camera phone away and keep it real with me
Time and time again I'm searching for reality
And feeling so alone

[Chorus]
Alone again (x3)
Alone...

[Verse 2]
I'm smoking that weed everyday but never hide my faith
They calling my phone, I don't even got the time a day
Don't know their motives anymore that's why I hesitate
I'm tired of partying and getting drunk, I'm trying to elevate
I remember back in the day, I ain't had no cash
I was coming up off of nothing hoping it would last
Now it's 2015 and I got it all
Feeling like I did, when I started on my own
Out here all alone

[Chorus]
Alone again (x3)
Alone...

[Outro]
No use looking out
It’s within that brings that
Lonely feeling
Understand that when you leave here
You’ll be clear
Among the better men

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning, feeling good that you were gone
Hurt for a while, but I'm finally moving on
Said it, did it, hit it, quit it, then you let it go
See you tryin' to call me, but I blocked you on my phone
It took a minute, but right now I'm feeling strong
It almost killed me, but I'm better off alone
Now you're saying that you're sorry, I don't wanna know
Better face the fact you had to go

[Chorus]
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is

[Post-Chorus]
You know, you never really knew how much you loved me till you lost me
Did you?
You know, you never really knew how much your selfish bullshit cost me
Well, fuck you
It might sound like I'm an
It might sound like I'm an

[Verse 2]
I know you'd like it if I sat at home and cried
But that ain't gonna happen, here's the reason why
When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied
When the gun was loaded, you were never on my side
I'm popping bottles that you can't even afford
I'm throwing parties and you won't get in the door
Said it, get it, love it, hate it, I don't care no more
Tell me how it feels to be ignored

[Chorus]
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is

[Post-Chorus]
You know, you never really knew how much you loved me till you lost me
Did you?
You know, you never really knew how much your selfish bullshit cost me
Well, fuck you
It might sound like I'm an
It might sound like I'm an

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
It might sound like I'm an
It might sound like I'm an

[Chorus]
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is

[Post-Chorus]
You know, you never really knew how much you loved me till you lost me
Did you?
You know, you never really knew how much your selfish bullshit cost me
Well, fuck you

[Chorus]
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an unapologetic bitch
But sometimes you know I gotta call it like it is
It might sound like I'm an
It might sound like I'm an

[Verse 1]
I'm under your spell
Pulled me in, took me down with your poisonous touch
You brought me to hell
Watched me burn with the fever that I love so much
You're watching me crawl
You get your kicks
Take your fist put it right through the wall
The drug that I crave
You're so clever, you're the devil, watch you slither away

[Chorus]
See I don't know what it is, but I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

[Verse 2]
Your truth is a lie
Bitter fruit, bitter sweet
But oh, so divine
Now that I've had a taste
Like a moth to a flame
I'm addicted to fame

[Chorus]
See I don't know what it is, but I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

[Post-Chorus]
I'm addicted
I'm, I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm, I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm, I'm addicted
To the one that got away

[Chorus]
See I don't know what it is, but I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away
See I don't know what it is, but I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

[Post-Chorus]
I'm addicted
I'm, I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm, I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm, I'm addicted
To the one that got away

[Intro: Madonna]
You're gonna love this
You can't touch this
'Cause I'm a bad bitch

[Verse 1: Madonna]
We hit the elevator right up to the rooftop
The bass is pumping, make me wanna screw the top off
Yeah, we'll be drinking and nobody's gonna stop us
And we'll be kissing anybody that's around us

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
I just wanna have fun tonight (Blow up this shit tonight)
Put me under the flashing light
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Madonna]

Bitch, I'm Madonna
Bitch, bitch I'm Madonna
Bitch, bitch I'm Madonna

[Verse 2: Madonna]
We're jumping in the pool and swimming with our clothes on
I poured a beer into my shoe and got my freak on
The neighbor's pissed and says he's gonna call the Five-O
If they show up then we are gonna give a good show

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
I just wanna go up tonight
Pull me under the flashing light
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Let me blow up this house tonight (Gon' blow up)

[Drop: Nicki Minaj]

[Bridge: Madonna]
Who do you think you are?
You can't mess with this lucky star
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Who do you think you are?

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, poured up with my nose up and that rose up in that thinga
I'm froze up with my stove up 'cause he eating like it's his dinner
I run shit, I don't fall back 'cause I'm on track, I'm a sprinter
I'm bossed up, I got 'em awestruck, it's not a toss-up, I'm the winner
Beep-beep, bitch move, 'fore I bang-bang with that Uzi
That's Miu Miu on my shoes, ain't got a thing left for me to prove (Uh)
It's that bottle service all night, it's that pop and urban just right
It's that "go hard or go home" zone, bitch
I'm Madonna, these hoes know

[Chorus: Madonna & Nicki Minaj]
We go hard or we go home

We get freaky if you want
Bitch, I'm Madonna

[Post-Chorus: Madonna]
We do it like this
You're gonna love this
You can't touch this
'Cause I'm a bad bitch
Who do you think you are? ('Cause I'm a bad bitch)
Who do you think you are? ('Cause I'm a bad bitch)
Who do you think you are? ('Cause I'm a bad bitch)
Who do you think you are?

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Go-hard-or-go-home zone, bitch
I'm Madonna, these hoes know
Go-hard-or-go-home zone, bitch
I'm Madonna, these hoes know

[Verse 1]
Do we need to start a war?
Do we need to take a side?
If we open up our eyes
Realize that we are blind
Is it all worth fighting for
It all comes down to

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Who's wrong or right
Who's black or white
It doesn't matter what you're bleeding for
Straight or bi, you're God or mine
It doesn't matter underneath it all

[Chorus]
'Cause we're only here to love
Like there's no tomorrow
So let's live each moment like
Our time is only borrowed

[Verse 2]
Do we need to build a bomb?
Do we need to fire a gun?
If you have to stand your ground
It's a war that can't be won
Is it all worth dying for?
It all comes down to

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Who's rich or poor
Virgin or whore
It doesn't matter what you're praying for
Death or life, your truth or mine
It doesn't matter underneath it all

[Chorus]
'Cause we're only here to love
Like there's no tomorrow
So let's live each moment like
Our time is only borrowed

[Verse 1]
Cut me down the middle
Fucked me up a little
You said I was your queen
I tried to give you everything
And now you want your freedom
You got just what you came for
A bit of fame and fortune
And I’m no longer needed

[Pre-Chorus]
You said it was over, wanted it to end
Then you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends
You had a few secrets I was never told
Now everyone's talking and I'm the last to know

[Chorus 1]
Now I'm in the middle of Heartbreak City (Heartbreak City)
'Cause I'm in the middle of a world not pretty (World not pretty)
Your clever game got the best of me (Best of me)
But you ain't gonna get the rest of me (Rest of me)
'Cause I'm in Heartbreak City

[Verse 2]
Tore me into pieces
Didn't have no damn reason
I let you in my house
You helped yourself to everything
And left me with your mess
I curse the day we met
The memory is haunting me
I wish I could forget

[Pre-Chorus]
You said it was over, wanted it to end
Then you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends
You had a few secrets I was never told
Now everyone's talking and I'm the last to know

[Chorus 2]
I'm in the middle of Heartbreak City  (Heartbreak City)
Now I'm in the middle of a world not pretty (World not pretty)
Now I'm in the middle of heartbreak City (Heartbreak City)
'Cause I'm in the middle of a world not pretty (World not pretty)
Your clever game got the best of me (Best of me)
But you ain't gonna get the rest of me (Rest of me)
'Cause I'm in Heartbreak City

[Outro]
And it's not that pretty
And I still feel shitty

[Verse 1]
It's not Jay-Z and Beyoncé
It's not Nicki or Lil Wayne
It's not Oprah and Obama
The Pope and Rihanna
Queen Elizabeth or Kanye
It's not pentagrams or witchcraft
It's not triangles or stacks of cash
Black magic or Gaga
Gucci or Prada
Riding on the Golden Calf

[Pre-Chorus]
All-Seeing Eye is watching tonight
That's what it is, Truth and the Light
All-Seeing Eye is watching tonight
Nothing to hide, the secret's inside

[Chorus]
It's like, everybody in this party shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party shining like Illuminati

[Post-Chorus 1]
It's the enlightenment that started it all
The Founding Fathers wrote it down on the wall
And now the media's misleading us all
Turned right into wrong
It's time to dance and turn this dark into something
So let the fire burn, this music is bumping
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonight

[Verse 2]
Behind the curtain of the New World Order
It's not platinum encrypted corners
It's not ISIS or the Phoenix
Pyramids of Egypt
Don't make it into something sordid
It's not Steve Jobs or Bill Gates
It's not the Google of United States
It's not Bieber or LeBron
Clinton or Obama
Or anyone you love to hate

[Pre-Chorus]
All-Seeing Eye is watching tonight
That's what it is, Truth and the Light
All-Seeing Eye is watching tonight
Nothing to hide, secret's inside

[Chorus]
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati

[Post-Chorus 2]
You know that everything that glitters ain't gold
So let the music take you out of control
It's time to feel it in your body and soul
C'mon, let's go
We're gonna dance and turn this dark into something
So let the fire burn, this music is bumping
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonight

[Breakdown]
It's like
It's like
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like illuminati

[Chorus]
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati

[Outro]
Everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati

[Verse 1]
Each time they take the photograph
I lose a part I can't get back
I wanna hide
This is the part where I detach
Each time they write a hateful word
Dragging my soul into the dirt
I wanna die
Never admit it but it hurts

[Chorus]
I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
But I'm in the dark, yeah
I can't be your superhero right now
Even hearts made out of steel can break down
You'll always be my soldier I can depend on

[Post-Chorus]
Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be a war but I'm not going down

[Verse 2]
One little lie can ruin my day
Words are like weapons, they betray
When I am afraid
One word of kindness, it can save me

[Chorus]
I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
But I'm in the dark, yeah
I can't be your superhero right now
Even hearts made out of steel can break down
You'll always be my soldier I can depend on

[Bridge]
Being destructive isn't brave
They couldn't say it to my face
One day I won't care
But for the moment I'm not there
I'll just close my eyes and let you catch me now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
But I'm in the dark, yeah
I can't be your superhero right now
Even hearts made out of steel can break down
You'll always be my soldier I can depend on

[Post-Chorus]
Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be a war but I'm not going down
Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be a war but I'm not going down

[Verse 1]
First you love me and I let you in
Made me feel like I was born again
You empowered me, you made me strong
Built me up, and I could do no wrong
I let down my guard, I fell into your arms
Forgot who I was, I didn't hear the alarms
Now I'm down on my knees, alone in the dark
I was blind to your game, you fired a shot in my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Took me to Heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on

[Chorus]
Living for love, I'm living for love
Not giving up, I'm gonna carry on
Living for love, I'm living for love
Not gonna stop, love's gonna lift me up

[Drop]
(Love, lift me up)
Love's gonna lift me up
(Love, lift me up)

[Verse 2]
I could get caught up in bitterness
But I'm not dwelling on this crazy mess
I found freedom in the ugly truth
I deserve the best, and it's not you
You've broken my heart, but you can't break me down
Not falling apart, once was lost, now I'm found
Picked up my crown, put it back on my head
I can forgive, but I will never forget

[Pre-Chorus]
Took me to Heaven, let me fall down
Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on
Lifted me up and watched me stumble
After the heartache, I'm gonna carry on

[Chorus]
Living for love, I'm living for love
Not giving up, I'm gonna carry on
Living for love, I'm living for love
Not gonna stop, love's gonna lift me up

[Drop]
(Love, lift me up)
Love's gonna lift me up
(Love, lift me up)
Love, gonna lift me up
(Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up)

[Bridge]
'Cause love's gonna lift me up, up, up, up, up
Lord, lift me up, up, up, up
Love's gonna lift me up, up, up, up, up
Lord, lift me up, up, up, up
Love's gonna lift me up
Lord, lift me up, up, up, up

[Chorus]
Living for love, I'm living for love
Not giving up, I'm gonna carry on
Living for love, I'm living for love
Not gonna stop, love's gonna lift me up

[Outro]
Love, love, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Take my sins and wash them away
Teach me how to pray
I've been stranded here in the dark
Take these walls away
I've been swimming in the ocean
Till I'm almost drowned
Give me something I can believe in
Teach me how to pray

[Pre-Chorus]
And we can do drugs, and we can smoke weed, and we can drink whiskey
Yeah, we can get high, and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue, and we can do E, and we can drop acid
Forever be lost, with no way home

[Chorus]
Yeah, we can run and we can hide, but we won't find the answers
If you go down, then you'll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul, then we should travel all together
And make the devil pray

[Drop]
(Oooh save my s-, oooh save my s-, oooh save my s-)
Devil's here to fool ya
(Oooh save my s-, oooh save my s-, oooh save my s-)
Devil's here to fool ya
Oooh save my s-, oooh save my s-, oooh save my s-
Devil's here to fool ya
Oooh save my s-, oooh save my s-, oooh save my s-
Devil's here to fool ya

[Verse 2]
Mother Mary, can't you help me?
'Cause I've gone astray
All the angels that were around me
Have all flown away
The ground beneath my feet's getting warmer
Lucifer is near
Holding on, but I'm getting weaker
Watch me disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
And we can do drugs, and we can smoke weed, and we can drink whiskey
Yeah, we can get high, and we can get stoned
And we can sniff glue, and we can do E, and we can drop acid
Forever be lost, with no way home

[Chorus]
Yeah, we can run and we can hide, but we won't find the answers
If you go down, then you'll get help along the way
But if you wanna save your soul, then we could travel all together
And make the devil pray

[Drop]
Ooh, ooh, sing hallelujah
Ooh, save my soul
Ooh, ooh, the devil's here to fool ya
Until my story's told
I said ooh, ooh, sing hallelujah
Ooh, save my soul
Ooh, ooh, the devil's here to fool ya
Until my story's told

[Outro]
I said (Ooh, ooh, sing hallelujah)
(Ooh, save my soul) Sing hallelujah
(Ooh, ooh, the devil's here to fool ya)
Until my story's told

[Verse 1]
I'm a poet
You're a thief
Welcome to my side
Of the street
Drink my wine
Free the beast
We're all fighters

[Chorus]
In the revolution (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
It's calling out our names
It's a constitution (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
And our struggle's all the same
Who can you blame? Ha
The revolution

[Verse 2]
It's our job
We have no choice
Chain the system
Use your voice
Don't look back, no regrets
Strap your boots on

[Chorus]
It's a revolution (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
And it's calling out your names
In the constitution (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Our struggle's all the same
Who can you blame? Ha
The revolution

[Verse 3]
Ain't no stopping
Us today
Better watch out
You're in the way
We're the children
Of the future
Haven't you heard

[Chorus]
About the revolution?
And it's calling out your names
In the constitution
And our struggle's all the same
Who can you blame? Ha
The revolution

[Outro]
(Ooh-ooh)
Ain't no stopping
Us today
Better watch out
You're in the way
We're the children
Of the future
Haven't you heard
About the revolution?

[Verse 1]
The best things in life are free
But you can't give them to the birds and bees
I want money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want

[Verse 2]
Your love gives me such a thrill
But your love won't pay my bills
I want money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
Oh

[Verse 3]
And money don't get everything, it's true
What it don't get, I can't use
I want that money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want

[Outro]
I want money
I want lots of money
In fact, I want so much money
Give me that money
Get, get, get, get me money
Get, get, get, get me money
I want that money

Money, decision-makin', only worried 'bout stuntin'
She worried 'bout me, her nigga worried 'bout cuffin'
I wanna see her body (Body)
Then she said, "Get inside of me

Paper, paper, I'm ridin' 'scrapers in California ('fornia)
Car smell like ammonia, we got that stank on us
Never been a Outkast, that stank on ya

Yeah, this that fly shit (I need you)
King shit only
Drop top, no roof, ha!

[Verse 1]
I met him in a swamp down in Dagobah
Where it bubbles all the time like a giant carbonated soda
S-O-D-A, soda
I saw the little runt sitting there on a log
I asked him his name and in a raspy voice he said, "Yoda"
Y-O-D-A, Yoda
Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda

[Chorus]
Well, I've been around, but I ain't never seen
A guy who looks like a Muppet, but he's wrinkled and green
Oh, my Yoda
Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda
Well, I'm not dumb, but I can't understand
How he can lift me in the air just by raising his hand
Oh, my Yoda
Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda
Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda

[Post-Chorus]
Well I left home just a week before
And I've never, ever been a Jedi before
But Obi-Wan, he set me straight, of course
He said, "Go to Yoda and he'll show you the Force"

[Chorus]
Well I'm not the kind that would argue with Ben
So it looks like I'm gonna start all over again
With my Yoda
Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda
Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda

[Refrain]
Yoda
Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda
Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda

[Bridge]
So, I used the Force
I picked up a box
I lifted some rocks
While I stood on my head
Well, I won't forget what Yoda said

[Verse 2]
He said, "Luke, stay away from the Darker Side
And if you start to go astray, let the Force be your guide"
Oh, my Yoda
Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda
"I know Darth Vader's really got you annoyed
But remember, if you kill him, then you'll be unemployed"
Oh, my Yoda
Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda

[Chorus]
Well, I heard my friends really got in a mess
So I'm gonna have to leave Yoda, I guess
But I know that I'll be coming back someday
I'll be playing this part till I'm old and grey
The long-term contract I had to sign
Says I'll be making these movies till the end of time
With my Yoda
Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda
Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda

[Outro]
Yoda
Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda
Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda
Yoda
Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda
Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda
Yoda
Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda
Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda

Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda
Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda

Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda
Yo-Yo-Yo-Yo-Yoda

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
So what you trying to do to me?
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies
But we get along when I'm inside you
You're like a drug that's killing me
I cut you out entirely
But I get so high when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down, rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
So if I run, it's not enough
You're still in my head, forever stuck
So you can do what you wanna do
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up
But don't deny the animal
That comes alive when I'm inside you

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down, rolling on the ground
You can pretend that it was me, but no, oh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
Don't tell no lies, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No girl don't lie, lie, lie, lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
The beast inside, si-si-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
I am one of a kind like a white lion
Drop down fangs in the night time
We can do things until the sun rises
She got that sunshine, I'm talkin' 'bout good good
And when she expose her super moon
I'ma give her that good wood
Astronaut, plant a pole with a flag on it
Best she ever had and clearly all she ever wanted, homie
#YouCouldNeverBeThis
Another #StevieWonderYouWillNeverSeeThisEither
I run my fingers over that cleavage like I'm reading braille
She's the leading lady in every one of my freaky tales
Loyale and royale, she earned her crown and throne
Ride or die to the fullest, a house is not a home when she's gone

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent from miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Baby, I'm...

Thugger
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I'ma ball like Spalding, nigga
I'm a blood I'mma baller, you can call a nigga
And I'm smokin' angel dust, yeah, spa, nigga
And I'm attracted to green like war niggas
I'ma pull up late, Ricki Lake
And my jewelry's no joke, shit frosted like flakes
I swear to God I'm baked like Easy Baker
I send a bank statement, that shit sound like a taser
Yeah she shoutin' like I shot her with a taser
Fly that bitch to LA, she ballin' like a Laker
I know not to tell and never speak to the neighbor
In fact, I can't see 'em, I'm on so many acres
Ever since I met shawty I feel like Hercules
And I'm smokin' bales of weed 'cause it grow on trees
Six golds in my mouth like a set of keys
With my West Boast Blood bangin' burgundy
Rich bags under my eyes, nigga, Birkin these
She say I want Victoria Secrets
And I fuck her long, watch her decrease
Even though I'm a blood, she like, "CC"
She get mad whenever I bring a BB
Shootin' a .223, DVD
Watch me shoot a foe, way down the street
Cost a whole hunnid bands, band with the heat
I'mma die for my clan, Ku Klux me
Diamonds red like a muhfucka cut me
And I smoke rusty and dusty

[Chorus: Young Thug]
What are you doin' in this game?
I wanna know, what are you doin' in this game?
Hey, baby girl whatcha doin' out here, what the fuck are you doin' out here?
Hey, I know whatcha doin' out here, I know whatcha doin' out here
You killin' these bitches, killin' these niggas
Cook a lot of white like Tommy Hilfiger
Ayy, baby girl gimme this twat
Hey, she love to sound like Brian Nichols

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Hahaha, hey, ayy, Brian Nichols with a pussy, shawty killed it
I ain't lookin' for the swoop, I need a bitch who got a million
I want a bitch with some loot who gone take care of her kids
I mean make sure her kids straight forever, udigg?
I won't stop gettin' money forever, udigg?
And I ain't talkin' bout a shovel, hmph, udigg?
I just bought a new dog that ate up the pig
I just bought a new car, a hunnid, udigg?
Pshht, stop, a hunnid ain't shit
Two boys, one month, a hunnid on them
Can't go broke, it may not come again
But a lot of money comin' in, you don't belong here, so

[Chorus: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
What are you doin' in this game? (Whatcha doin', whatcha doin'?)
I wanna know, what are you doin' in this game? (Tell me, tell me, tell me)
Hey, baby girl whatcha doin' out here, what the fuck are you doin' out here? (What?)
Hey, I know whatcha doin' out here, I know whatcha doin' out here

Hey, she love to sound like Brian Nichols (Ayy)

[Outro: Young Thug]
Baby, watch out for the shark, watch out for the cops, watch out for the thots
Ayy, they just want a piece of you like me, beat 'em like Bruce Lee
Facin' life and you broke, look at my shoulder, boy, you can cry on me
No, no tellin', but I told ya, "You can't control these streets"
If a pussy nigga play, I'm gonna gun him down like a G
Baby, you can't see me, I'm ballin', you can't even D me

[Intro]
Money, forget the money

[Hook]
The root of all evil deceiving cause even
My closest people tryin' to get me for my (money)
Cause envy breeds jealousy, jealousy breeds hate
They on the taste for the (money)
Now where do I begin? They send you out to reel you back in
And its all for the (money)
Cause envy breeds jealousy, jealousy breeds hate
They on the taste for the (money)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
My biggest gift and my curse
More money, more problems tell me what's worse
Getting audited by the government, giving up millions to the IRS
Or having to take a paternity test from a bitch I never met
I'm getting sued by my own family member, all cause my dog bit her
And she was the one who walked up and put her hand out, and now she got her handout
It's driving me crazy, almost as if this shit was planned out
What else can anybody do to me? It ain't new to me when every time I turn around
Another money hungry motherfucker suing me
Truthfully, I've had it up to here
And it don't help that Forbes reports what I'm makin every year
They listen closely, and I was really demonized
That I was told to go to school, graduate and get a job
But I'm a Hip Hop cash king, rapper from the South
And everybody wants the easy way out

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Yeah, rappers foreclosin' on their houses
Can't keep up the payments, they owe a couple hundred thousand
Say they making millions, and bills steady pillin'
Diamonds on their neck, they kids' stomach out here growlin
Get your priorities in order nigga
You talk about it, but you really can't afford it nigga
That car you bought depreciated once you drove off
No wonder your baby momma wanna knock your nose off (BLAHHH)
Half the industry going bankrupt
You see em' smiling in the club with their drinks up
Don't let that television fool ya
Off camera they sweating and stressin
My young students, let me school ya
The diamonds ain't worth half what you bought them for (no)
Soon all that Gucci don't fit, now you out of dough
One day your pocket's alright now they all wrong
Fuck you gonn' do when it's all gone
Talkin bout the

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Lemme talk to these hoes, woadie
Uhh, uh
Imagine being worth a 100 mill
Your potentials of having a billion is only real
Images, more bitches and they named in your will
A new Mercedes, a baby, your aim was to chill
You choose a pussy or pop a bottle, grow half a mill
All you wanted was some entertainment
All she wanted was some litigation
Exploiting a simple penetration
Telling the courtroom that I'm being evasive
She wanted to walk into the SunTrust
She made me sign over my lil son's trust
Take away the joy my lil daughter brings
Bitch even wanted to take my daughter's rings
Misfortunes of a rich nigga
You watch BET while she look at the big picture

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I am gone, everybody's raging
And these fruits, they still taste of poison

[Chorus 1]
I won't be around
When you really need me

[Verse 2]
I can't sleep, why can't someone hold me?
I need warmth, our restless body cracks and moans

[Chorus 2]
I won't have the strength
When you really need me

[Verse]
The easiest way to sleep at night
Is to carry on believing that I don't exist
The easiest way to sell your soul
Is to carry on believing that we don't exist
It must be hard, hard
With your head on backwards

[Verse 1]
Rust in the mountains, rust in the brain
The air is sacred here in spite of your claim
Up on the the rooftops, out of reach
Trickster is meaningless, trickster is weak

[Bridge]
He's talking out the world, talking out the world

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway

[Verse 2]
I wanted you so bad, that I couldn't say
All things fall apart
We wanted out so bad, that we couldn't say
These things fall apart

[Bridge]
We're talking out the world, talking out the world

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway

[Verse 3]
Truant kids, a can of brick dust worms
Who do not want to climb down from their chestnut tree
Long white gloves, police check carefully
Escaped from the zoo, the perfect child facsimile is

[Bridge]
Talking out the world, talking out the world

[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
I must get out once in a while
Everything is starting to die
The dust settles, the worms dig
And spiders crawl over the bed

[Verse 2]
I must get out once in a while
I eat all day and now I'm fat
Yesterday's meal is hugging the plates
You never wash up after yourself
At the start of each issue, we all sit down to brainstorm potential profiles and features; Mike Tyson has been on this list since issue one. With the article now realized, the ideas that everything happens at the right time for good reason and nothing great comes easily ring all too true. When the opportunity to do a feature on him became a real possibility for this issue, the question internally became how to share a side of Mike Tyson that is different from the countless interviews, articles, biographies both authorized and unauthorized, documentaries and films to date.
We all agreed that our best shot at having a unique angle would be to find the right person to interview him, and thanks to Leila Steinberg, Earl Sweatshirt of Odd Future agreed to the task. On November 4th, we took a flight to Las Vegas, where Earl sat down with Mike. There were many times when this interview could have fallen apart, both in the days and weeks leading up to it and even after we arrived, but it happened, and the results were worth every moment. I didn’t know much about Mike Tyson prior to this experience, but what I learned from him is invaluable. That is not to say he is without faults like all of us, but he’s the first to admit them, and his honesty, openness, insight, strength and perseverance make him someone I greatly admire. I hope you find the following conversation as rewarding as Earl and all of us at HUMANITY do.

Mike: How old are you, man?
Earl: I’m 20.
Mike: What do you have to say to me?
Earl: So I got presented with the opportunity to come talk to you.
Mike: Yeah.  Where are you from?
Earl: I’m from LA. So I was trying to figure out kind of what angle to start at when I first got approached with this.
Mike: Are you now?
Earl: Well the first thing that came to mind after doing just a little bit of research that I did was just some of the parallels that – just between me and you, that I thought we had just at 20. Just with being in the position that you was in.
Mike: I mean, you’re pretty much an idiot at 20.
Earl: Right, that’s what I feel like. I got to 20, and I -
Mike: You’re not an idiot, but you are. You don’t really think you’re an idiot, but you are.
Earl: Right.
Mike: But you don’t think it. Like you’re in agreement, but you’re an idiot.
Earl: No, I swear, I was talking to someone yesterday, and I said the mark of me being an adult was when I got to the point where I realized how little I knew.
Mike: Oh, man. I’m humbled with that every moment of my life.  I think I know a lot, but I don’t know anything. I think I know a lot; they talk about a lot of subjects and issues but in the scheme of the world, it’s really not even a grain of salt.
Earl: So, I just thought you would have some real valuable insight just to give to people who are in positions like mine or just similar to mine where you’re just a young person getting pulled from every single different direction.
Mike: Who’s pulling you? Record companies and stuff?
Earl: Well, at first it was record companies, and then when that kind of settled down, it was management.
Mike: What do you need management for? When you think about it, what’s the purpose of management? In boxing, in my opinion. For boxers! I think they, I don’t know, they’re glamorized babysitters.
Earl: Yes, 100%.
Mike: So they say, “Hey, come here. We gotta go here. We gotta go there. We gotta go here. We gotta go there.” You have to give 10 or 15% of your money, whatever it is…
Earl: To think for you, almost, to handle like, kind of mindless duties.
Mike: Yeah, you’ve thought about that too?
Earl: Yeah. Me and Leila always talk about that, she tells me all the time I am unmanageable. Just because I am reclusive and I am the worst at communicating.
Mike: Well, that could be good too. Because the most important thing in the world for show business, really, you know everything’s a high-tech business, but what people want now is what they can’t get – exclusivity. You know, when you’re exclusive, you know what I mean.
Earl: It’s the allure.
Mike: Yeah.
Earl: It’s what draws people to you.
Mike: None of us are really who we appear to be. Like me talking to you, this is not who I am.
Earl: Right.
Mike: We’re in an interview. This is not who you are. We are never who we appear to be.
Earl: Mhmm.
Mike: And yeah, but like you said it’s the allure, exclusivity. The less you give, the more they want.
Earl: It’s what has worked with so many people. I don’t know if you know one of my favorite artists, André 3000, like he has dropped probably 10 or 15 songs that fans of his know every single word to, as opposed to like 1,000 songs, some is good, some is bad.  A testament to the exclusivity.
Mike: Yeah, he is a big-time guy.
Earl: Because he does so little.
Mike: Sometimes, people have reasons for being that way, something that you’re hiding, sometimes just like – some people don’t want people to know them, because they’re vulnerable. They have no more power, they feel.
Earl: That’s true. I think mine was more gradual, because I used to be a much more social person. And when I was 16, I got sent away for bad behavior by my mom.
Mike: What did you do?
Earl: I hadn’t done anything specifically, but it was just like -
Mike: Did you break the law?
Earl: I broke the law, but it wasn’t so much that, she was worried about my identity, you know what I mean, and just how I was establishing it. Like the man I was becoming. So I had to spend that year and a half just like searching for myself, you know what I mean, just like figuring myself out.
Mike: We don’t know at 20 years old the man we want to be. I just recently found out the man I wanted to be in life. I said, “This is the guy I want to be.” And I realized everything I did in the past prevented me from being the person that I wanted to be, so I don’t do what I did in the past anymore. But it took me to be what, 45, 47, 48 to really get it, so it’s not like I’m some genius. I learned from experience, no one told me to follow anybody else’s example, I had to feel the stove to realize it was hot. Some people say I’m an idiot because it took me this long to get it and some people can get it right away, some people take a long time. But I got it, At least I got it, some people never get it. I grasped it. I realized I’m not in the streets, I’m not in the clubs no more, you know, I’m not sleeping with strippers or anybody like that.
Earl: Right.
Mike: But whatever it is I’m just not doing that. I never really knew what dignity was until recently. And I realized that more so not because of myself but the response I get from people, you know, a woman won’t have to worry about talking to me and worrying about me hitting on them anymore or anything like that.
Earl: And that’s gotta be the best feeling.
Mike: Yeah, it makes me feel good, because when you sleep with so many people, all my life I thought that was adding to who I was, but it takes so much away from you.
Mike: You know anger is my biggest enemy in life. I do a lot of reading on the history. I read the history, the whole history of the world, you know, from the beginning. And we have so many people, a lot of people. But do you know what we did more than fornicate?
Earl: Fight?
Mike: War, yeah. We fought more than we fucked. Ain’t that crazy?  We got billions people on the planet. Even from the beginning, from the beginning of time when that book starts, fighting! What are we getting into now? Fighting! Fighting…from all that fighting, great names, great great great names, them fools be fighting, you know like George Washington All the great names, all these names came from fighting. And what for…
Earl: Fighting against something.
Mike: Yeah, themselves.
Earl: Some were fighting for like civil rights, you know – like it’s all fighting.
Mike: I think war is led by faith. I never think of physical fighting. It’s always spiritual. Fighting is spiritual.
Earl: Absolutely. Yeah. I got familiar with that concept early, just because my mom, she was always working, so she dropped me off at this martial arts dojo. And the dude instilled – we had to meditate for an hour every time, before we did anything. We would meditate. Just to connect to the spiritual side of it. And like, going inside of yourself and realizing the immense power that lies within you, just as a person.
Mike: You know young man; it’s all about spiritual awakenings. I could never stop drugs, I could never stop drinking, doing stuff, until I received my spiritual awakening. Now it’s not a problem anymore. But I’ve been doing this since the ’90s, late ’90s and I never could stop but I never understood the spiritual awakening. And once that comes into play, it’s really eye opening.
Earl: It’s so much bigger than human constraints.
Mike: You’ve got brothers and sisters?
Earl: yeah, I do. Like, my friends are my brothers. Like my real close ones. I got them like that. And I got siblings on my father’s side.
Mike: Tell me about you man, who you are, what’s your shtick, man.
Earl: I do music. So I came -
Mike: Like songs and stuff, records and radio and stuff?
Earl: Not so much radio. I was fortunate enough to – we like developed our own, like self-sustaining like fan base that was separate. So when I was like 14, I was getting better at rapping, like running around L.A., trying to find like people to do music with. And I linked up with this dude Tyler. And he had this whole thing going on already. We started making music, and it was like, it was idiot music, but it was really, I think, what we had in hindsight, what attracted so many people to it was potential. Like we weren’t necessarily talking about anything, but the way that the music was, it was like sophisticated in a sense for our age. So anyways, we’re doing that.
Mike: What’s the name of your music?
Earl: The group that I was in was called Odd Future. So we was doing that. Fast forward, 2010, so I want to say that was like 2008 to 2010. Mid 2010, I got sent away. And we blew up. Like at that moment, it was like hand in hand. I got sent away, and -
Mike: Tell me what you mean by “blow up”. I know what blowing up means but how did you experience—define “blowing up”. You got signed? They played your music?
Earl: Yeah, they started… but it wasn’t even so much, that they played our music on the radio, it was –
Mike: Clubs?
Earl: It was like – it was almost punk rock in the way that it took off. It was just kids became, like, obsessed with it, because they -
Mike: You a crunk dancer?
Earl: Nah…We didn’t dance too much, but it was – they got attached, because in the same way that that punk expressed, like, the angst of being a teenager so well, a lot of our music and early energy had a lot of those elements. You know, that teens, really attach to, you know what I mean – just illogical… passionate unaimed anger, you know. Like, I don’t even know, but I’m just swinging.
Mike: When’s your birthday?
Earl: February 24th.
Mike: Is that Pisces?
Earl: Yes, sir. So I get plucked out. It blows up while I’m gone. The whole time that I was gone, for the first year, I went to hell. It was the worst. Because I wasn’t involved.
Mike: Well, how exactly you wasn’t involved, because you weren’t there physically?
Earl: I wasn’t involved, I wasn’t there physically, I was mad.
Mike: But you were in the group; you were a member of the group on paper, right?
Earl: Yeah.
Mike: Did you receive your money?
Earl: I mean… I got money, but it was from when I signed my advance with the label.
Mike: I ain’t never loan friends money; I give it to ‘em and I don’t expect to get it back. Even when he says, “I’ll pay you back,” I never expect it. If he gives it back, then hey, that’s a feather in his cap, but I don’t expect to get it back.
Earl: That’s where I’m always at. I’m never…I was never even mad about it. I was just… way more obsessed with preserving the friendship.
Mike: Listen, you know sometimes that’s a really an intense word, “friend.” You know sometimes during a relationship, a friendship, a friend’s gonna have to prove they're your friend, and you’re gonna have to prove you’re their friend. You know, sometimes, the people we invest the most time in disappoint us the most.
Earl: Absolutely. This is the best way to summarize the situation.
Mike: In order to really be a friend to anybody, this is what I’ve learned in life and my experience only, not because I’m a genius, but that I’m saying some slick shit. I endured a lot of pain from this. In order to be a friend to anybody, you have to be a friend to yourself. If you’re not a friend to yourself, there’s no way you’re gonna have any friends.
Earl: If you’re stepping on yourself, then everyone else follows suit.
Mike: You have to be a friend to yourself. You know, ‘cause if you’re not a friend to yourself, you’re an enemy to yourself and if someone’s a friend of everybody they are an enemy to themselves. You know, you can’t be everybody’s friend, you can’t save the world, I learned this word: self-preservation. Once you do that, you can be friends with people, but how would you be a friend to anybody if you’re not a friend to yourself.
Earl: It’s like the same reason why they tell you to put the mask on yourself before the baby on a plane. Because if y’all both dead, because you was trying to help the baby, then what?
Mike: Exactly, you need to learn independence. You have to be independent – it builds character. You have to compete in life because if you don’t have no competition – no competition, no spirit, you know, you’ll fall under the slightest struggle… you know.
Earl: Absolutely – one thing I always try and tell dudes that are younger than me is that because of the Internet everyone can just be by themselves doing something, but the importance of a group is being able to have some sort of competition.
Mike: No doubt about it. You know, times have changed now because I grew up pretty much in the ‘70s, late, middle ‘70s. I met all my friends in the early ‘80s and met all my friends from fighting with them.
Earl: Yeah.
Mike: Most of them from the streets, we loved each other to death, we’d fight for each other, do anything…we even shot at each other. You know? We’re in different cliques, and we shot at each other. It’s really bizarre, if you think about it. It’s really bizarre. And I don’t know how it works, but it just works. It just works. Friends are very – that’s a very interesting word… human beings are a bad lot, y’know.
Earl: We’re some of the worst – yeah, I sit around and think sometimes about the constraints of being a human being.
Mike: You have to experience life. This world, That’s one big school out there. Outside is one big school. You know?
Earl: It gives you a Ph.D. in common sense.
Mike: Common sense is so very simple but very difficult to grasp.
Earl: Psh! Tell me about it. It’s crazy how many people are absent of common sense.
Mike: It’s all about the basics. If you can’t remember the small things, how are you going to remember the big things? Man- you know, the mind is a real dangerous neighborhood to travel by ourselves. You think the hood is bad? Try hanging out here by yourself.
Earl: It’s the worst. It’s the worst, man – I always say you can always spot an addict by the person that can’t stop talking. ‘Cause they can’t be in silence. There can’t be an idle moment.
Mike: You can tell when an addict’s lying, too.
Earl: Always.
Mike: You know why, because he’s talking but that’s what the ego is meant to do. The ego’s mean, he’s gotta to be crushed. That’s what I need, I need my ego crushed. Smashed, obliterated. But my ego has given me everything that I have. My ego’s given me fame. My ego’s given me hundreds of millions of dollars, the most beautiful woman in the world – how can I let this go, are you fucking nuts? How do I crush it, how do I let this go?
Earl: Dude, ego is my career. Rap music is all ego.
Mike: How you let it go, you know? It has to be crushed, but it gives you everything you want, but it takes back so much more in return.
Earl: I feel like – I was lucky enough to get my ego crushed, when I was, like, 16. When I got sent away.
Mike: You know, you’re only 20; you’re not crushed yet.
Earl: True -
Mike: It’ll be in hibernation for a while, but it comes back, that’s just how it is – it comes back to help you, it gives you confidence. Gives you a full sense of courage. It just does all that stuff. But it goes too far sometimes. You know, you can’t control it. It’s all about being in control. Like, your mind – if you did everything your mind told you to do, you do some really strange stuff. You’ll probably be in jail, you’ll be in trouble. But you know, it’s all about control. We all have to control our feelings. That’s the thing that separates us from animals.
Earl: One thing that my mom told me that stuck so much that I feel like relates to what you was just talking about is there being only two real primal emotions – fear and love. And like, the only thing that can combat fear is action. And there’s two actions. There’s fight and flight.
Mike: There’s nothing to fear but fear itself. It’s an illusion of fear. Fear is an illusion. If you gonna die, you gonna die anyway; it’s not something to fear, fear is not gonna help.
It’s going to be over soon. Somebody’s going to die, or somebody’s going to get sick, someone might leave. It’s not going to last forever. You know, it’s going to be over soon. You know, the thought of that never enters my mind. This is the reality of life. I watched that movie The Notebook. You ever watched that?
Earl: I haven’t watched it.
Mike: Ah, young man, I don’t even know if you understand that stage of life yet. Very interesting thing about that movie, very interesting, it’s one of the movies that makes me really vulnerable. It makes me very vulnerable, because you work so hard for something and you don’t want to let it go.
Earl: Mhmm.
Mike: Let me see. For instance, this is really interesting. It boggles me sometimes, I always wondered the way we determine our age.
Before Julius Caesar, because he made a year 365 days, how could we detect our age? How did we tell? Methuselah was 900, right? So back then it was probably weeks or something. So how did we detect how old we were, determine how old we were before Julius Caesar was born?
Earl: Before there was like a year system?
Mike: Yeah, how’s that one, that’s pretty tricky now, you think? So we don’t know how old we are.
Earl: Everything was based on the sun.  The sun. Setting, rising, over the course of the year, over the horizon.
Mike: Many moons, right? But when it comes down to really deep down, we don’t know anything. We don’t know anything. Nobody was actually there to tell, this is what actually happened. You know, no one can tell us; this is the real reason why Lincoln freed the slaves. No one can really say anything, they had to be there, you know, to tell us. When you think about it the world is, what? We don’t know how old the world is. But the written word is 6,000 years old. Six thousand years is a blink compared to the world, and the activity in the world. Six thousand years is nothing. Nothing.
Earl: That’s why all we got is right now.
Mike: Yeah, the moment. There’s no future in our past. Just experience. You know, we want to return to it, but we don’t want to close the door on it either. You know, that’s information so we don’t make the same mistakes.  There’s nothing wrong with making mistakes, just don’t make the same ones. We don’t want to duplicate them.
Earl: I’ve got a quick question for you. One of the things I thought was really interesting you said in your documentary was: “There’s nothing like being young, and happy, and fighting.”
It sounds like such a contradiction, you know, to be happy and fighting.
Mike: Right you know this is interesting that you say that. That’s wild. Because when people see me and they say I’m coming back from what they say is the doldrums, or disaster, or something. But listen, you’ve got to be happy now. I’m not happy because I have received such success, I’m happy because – I’m not doing anything deceitful, I think, to my family. I’m successful because I don’t have to sleep with one of my friends’ girlfriends or wife or something. That’s why I’m successful, that’s success to me. I’m not dead, I’m not in the gutter – that’s success to me.
Earl: And it’s a profound statement because if you’re happy, you enjoy what you’re doing. And when you stop it just means you’re just going through the motions.
Mike: Absolutely, because you go through the motions and you are still successful. Until you run into someone who’s happier doing what he’s doing.
Earl: Exactly. So my question was at what point did you stop being happy? Like when did you start feeling that you were clocking in?
Mike: Wow, that’s awful, you know. Really early in my career, probably 14.
Earl: My last question, Mike, when you like achieve success like you have, how does that affect those around you – how do you get them to be motivated and not feel content?
Mike: It’s just strange to me how I have such a profound passion for my kids. I think about Just wanting to protect them. – You think id ever let my son fight a 14-year-old kid or something like me that has nothing, never had nothing?
Earl: Because he comes from a different place. It comes from desperation.
Mike: I look at my beautiful son, he’s so beautiful and handsome. And I think what a guy like me would do to this face. I would choke it, take a chunk of meat out of his head, bite his beautiful face. I would hurt him, and I’m just looking at him and I’m thinking your dad was one of them animals out there. I don’t expect my kids to be “fighters”; my kids never lived in a condemned building with their family. Most of them are at Ivy League schools, their mothers are good mothers, you know, they do good stuff with them. I don’t want my kids to be like me, I don’t want my daughter to date the guy like me. You know, a guy like me success is to take care of my children to take care of their life and make ‘em cushioned. I don’t want them to be around a people like me. You know, success for me would be that they never have the opportunity of being in the presence of someone like me.

Graphite to paper
A saga-born, hand-drawn artisan dreamer
Graphite to paper
A saga-born and hand-drawn artisan dreamer
Miyazaki frontier
A crystal-clear picture of aluminum seeker
This view from here is airborne
Mystic catacomb creeper
Who whispers stone cold
And as the mind funnels deeper
A relic, a teacher
A talisman in the hand
Navigate to seek up above

[Chorus]
Laputa (Miss you)
Laputa (How I miss you)

Floating castle in the sky (miss you)

Feel this

I've been running, running, but the riot hunts for you, you, you, you
I've been running, running, but the riot hunts for you, you, you, you
I've been running, running, but the riot hunts for you, you, you, you
I've been running, running, but the riot hunts for you, you, you, you
Give me the timeless corridors of your meadows, of your meadows
Give me the timeless corridors of your meadows, of your meadows
Give me the timeless corridors of your meadows, of your meadows
Give me the timeless corridors of your meadow, of your meadows
Laputa
Laputa

[Verse 1]
You're never ever gonna cover up
You'll always remain
Sat there sipping on another cup
To take it away
It weighs so heavy so heavy, on your heart

[Chorus]
So what you gonna do now?
Now that you're falling, you're falling down
There's only so much I can do if you're not loving you

[Verse 2]
Marching in to try and save the day
And never works out
Always hopeful that I'll make a change
What's that about?
It weighs so heavy, so heavy on my heart

[Chorus]
So what you gonna do now?
Now that you're falling, you're falling down
There's only so much I can do if you're not loving you
I love you, I want you to be all that you can
If I could, then I would but you know that I can't, no I can't

[Shortened Chorus]
So what you gonna do now?
Now that you're falling, you're falling down
There's only so much I can do if you're not loving

[Outro]
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do now?
Now that you're falling, you're falling down
There's only so much I can do if you're not loving you

[Verse 1]
My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet your my favourite work of art

[Bridge]
Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

[Chorus]
But don't change your hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine, stay
Each day is valentine's day

[Bridge] + 

[Chorus]
Why should I bend down my head and cry?
Why should I bend down my head and cry?
The old world has ended,
The new world has just begun.
And all them people that live therein
Shall live on and on.
One more thing:
Got to get what I need,
Got to get what I want.
Got to get what I need,
Got to get what I want.
Got to get satisfaction,
Got to get the action.
Got love and affection.
One more thing:
Once there was two roads before us
To pick our choice.
But good has overcome bad.
The sheep has heard their master's voice.
So tell me why.
Why should I bend down my head and cry?
No reason why.
Why should I bend down my head and cry?
(Got to move) Got to groove.
Got to get what I want.
What did you say?
Got to get it.
Got to get what I need.
Got to get what I want.
Like I say, got to get it.
Got to get what I need...satisfaction.
The old world has ended,
The new world has just begun.
And all them people that live therein
Shall live on and on.
One more thing:
Why should I bend down my head and cry?
My father is a king.
Why should I bend down my head and cry?
All the riches in the earth.
So tell me why,
Why should I bend down my head and cry?

[Verse]
Come down from that mountain
That makes you think too much
Come down from that mountain
That only makes you cry
You say you had to do it
But I would do it too

Please dont think I'm never
Into what you are
I'll go outside with you
Cause that's what I want
You say you had to do it
But i would do it too

Then I'll sleep outside
Cause I've never done that
Then I might get scared
Cause I'm always like that
But you tell me that's how you were
When you first did something
That wasn't you
That wasn't you

[Verse 1]
Maybe it was all too much
Too much for a man to take
Everything's bound to break
Sooner or later, sooner or later
You're all that I can trust
Facing the darkest days
Everyone ran away
But we're gonna stay here, we're gonna stay here

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I know you're scared tonight
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I'll never leave your side

[Chorus]
When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghost town
When the world gets cold, I'll be your cover
Let's just hold onto each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

[Verse 2]
Tell me how we got this far
Every man for himself
Everything's gone to hell
We gotta stay strong, we're gonna hold on
This world has turned to dust
All we've got left is love
Might as well start with us
Singing a new song, something to build on

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I know you're scared tonight
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I'll never leave your side

[Chorus]
When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghost town
When the world gets cold, I'll be your cover
Let's just hold onto each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

[Bridge]
I know we're alright, 'cause we'll never be alone
In this mad, mad, in this mad, mad world
Even with no light, we're gonna shine like gold
In this mad, mad, in this mad, mad world

[Breakdown]
When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

[Chorus]
When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghost town
When the world gets cold, I'll be your cover
Let's just hold onto each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a ghost town
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

[Verse 1]
When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
'Cause she stay strong (Yeah, yeah)
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really, 'cause

[Chorus]
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

[Verse 2]
She walks like a model
She grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I'm the wizard of love
And I got the magic wand
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really 'cause

[Chorus]
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

[Bridge]
She gives me love and affection
Baby, did I mention, you're the only girl for me
No, I don't need a next one
Mama loves you too, she thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do
Is just for me to pop the question

[Chorus]
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

[Hook]
There's so many girls in here

Now that I'm choosing I chose you
Girl you going to do, club closed let's go so I can give it to you

[Verse 1]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Start with straight shots, then we pop the rose

[Hook]

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Man I've been trapping all day

You know I'm 'bout my paper no lie
They say they need that work we get it to them no time

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I'm 'bout mine drought time trying to stash cake
Cause niggas Dave Chappele with work they selling half baked
Drop it in the pot you lose mad weight
A nigga sell me that we set his ass straight

Show up to his crib in the a.m. and get murdered
Word up get these niggas something they ain't heard of
Cause I'm well respected well connected like a server
The nerve of fucking lames thinking its a fucking game
We 

[?] up in rain
No rims on it fuck 'em plain
Fuck 'em good fuck 'em hard
Hating niggas fuck 'em all
Half them niggas fuck with law they cross that line get fucking knocked
But I don't get mad I just get paper
See me fresh in DTS laughing like hi hater
I tap on the gas and its bye hater
We get them squares in a little package like Now & Laters

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gillie Da Kid]
You see whatever you need you could get it here
My niggas always got it they getting it off the pier
You want to last long in this game well listen here
You keep your mouth close make sure that work it disappears
I can get you murked with a whisper in the ear
Getting it cracking over here
They getting work but ain't no action over there
These rappers is actions I swear
I moved so much shit I should win trapper of the year
See I'm posted on that block watching over bread
I got forty on my hip and get one up in the head
Let a nigga run up and he dead I promise that
Live by that G cod and I'mma always honor that
Where the fuck did these niggas find you at
Your money too short your mula too light
Your paper too thin hommie you ain't got to win
This Gillie and Meek two nigga from the streets
Stay fly that's why your bitches leave with me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Now get with me 

[?] or big glizzy
Brick of raw looking like an Xbox 360
Riding dirty through the hood like a Banshee 350
Bout to take it to the trap and tell my man get busy
Got them hands like Bibby ya the whip game proper
I was fucking with that hard 'til the wrist game got up
Then my bitch game got up
Every whore that I adore they was checking for the boy
But I was checking for the raw
Either posted on the block right in the cut next to the store
With dimes of vanilla had the fiends like it was Thriller
Ya I mean I would kill them on the 1st
Came out early in the morning trying to make the birds chirp

[Hook]

[Verse]
Let me take these niggas way back
Way back curtains closed like you was in a Maybach
North where I was raised at where niggas getting murdered out
For running out the motor mouth about shit they ain't even heard about
Feds snooping around the town trying to sniff them birdies out
Youngins running reckless with they burners out we burned them out
Old heads they all dead they the ones who turnt us out
Consequences we wasn't concerned about or worried about
Repercussions that could lead to the reaper coming
Cause where I'm from niggas is cold freezer something
So put your hoodie on or bring some heat or something
Niggas will stab you in the back as soon as they see you fronting
My hood ain't no sweet sixteen
Where I come from its a blessing just to be sixteen
I never wanted to be big screen
I only wanted the money that came from a big dream
I ain't been to sleep since, hard grinding intense
Ambition got me fucking bad bitches ten cent
Shining on these haters counting paper 'til my 

[?]
Cause ever since I was like ten my main goal was to get rich
Second grade I got A's, fourth grade I got B's
Sixth grade I got F's High School I just slept
Fuck around on Burks Street a lot of niggas got wet
And I ain't talking PCP I'm talking 'bout them big tecs
Money power respect drug money big checks
Niggas fucking with them birds and I ain't talking Dipset
I refuse to let these street swallow me
And the system devour me rather make them bow to me
Phialdel where the killers dwell where the goons creep
Where the sun don't ever shine and only the moon peep
Right around the corner from the devil and doom street
Where niggas never make it you want ti then take it
Well if I'm not mistaken you'll get shot for Nathen
Wrong time place victim of a crime rate
Niggas will put you on a page no Myspace
Tears all on your mom face nigga where I come from

[Intro: Mike Hype]
If he don't hit it right shawty you can call me
See I know what to do with all that in them jeans

[Verse 1: K Smith]
Hey ma I love how your clothes skin tight like a baby fit
Word to life you the type to have a baby with
You half white so your hair got the wavy dip
But you mixed with black too so you crazy thick
When we met you was hella down
And that's why I took you out them clear diamonds to them yellows now
We on a whole 'nother level now
And plus your head so right you make a youngin want to settle down
Hey don't trip when I grind here
Because I got a stack so you fall back like a reclined chairs
I can see you trying to sell through that blue c
Her in a new V playing with her new seat
You got a cold wrist showing off the new freeze
Forget the old whip come and get the new keys
Show them how I do please I make it rain in your crib ma
K will have you feeling like a

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I said shawty what it is tell me what it do
You got such a bad body I could put it on you
You should thank the lord God bless them like achoo
36-24-36 you're 22?
Shining like a diamond gleeming, caught me when I seen her
And the next thing you know we was in and out of Neiman's
Girl that head so good I would've thought you was a genius
I served it like I was Venus, she hit it back like Serena
I might tuck her like Chris
I ain't ever seen a hotty with a body like this
Like her's nice curves pretty face like word
She throw it at me I catch it like Mike Irv-
Shawty you could have the cover shot
Something that I love a lot I could put you in another spot
Sit you in a bubble drop turn you into a superstar
Have you fly shining harder than a shooting star

[Hook: Mike Hype]
Shawty know she got a bad body

See your the sweetest little thing in the whole wide world

So don't say no give me a try
Cause I'm gonna love you for the rest of my life
See your the sweetest little thing in the whole wide world

So don't say no give me a try
Cause I'm gonna love you for the rest of my life

[Hook: Mike Hype]
Shawty know she got a bad body

Damn right baby you a hotty
And girl I really need to know what's up
Shawty know she got a bad body
36-24-36
Damn right baby you a hotty
And girl I really need to know what's up

[Verse]
Yeah, I'm ready to do it all over
My heart colder, hip-hop I'm part owner
Southern rap specialist, verses intelligent
Elegant, it's ludacrious to ever question my relevance
No pun intended, if no one's offended, get offended
Don't get it twisted, guns can get extended
Ready to die for my respect, my value, my worth
Unequivocal, lyrical beast on every fuckin' verse!
I throw the curse just to stretch the emotions
Somebody said I'm washed up, I told 'em "Pass me the lotion"
Cause the industry's dryin' up and these verses are moisturizer
Then hand me your favorite rapper and Luda will posterize him
I'm dunkin' over you critics, dozin' off when I'm spittin'
My fans locked behind these bars, I put my life in a sentence
Good riddance, I wake 'em up if they step to the plate
Cause sleep's the cousin of death and I could never relate!
Luda!

[Outro]
See the only people I owe my loyalty to are the ones who never made me question it. Loyalty goes both ways but never push a loyal person to the point when they no longer give a fuck. There comes a time in life where you walk away from all the drama and the people who create that shit. Destroy what destroys you! You'll never see all the great things ahead if you keep looking at all the bad things behind you. They say the hardest things in life is know which bridge to cross and which ones to burn. So may the bridges I burn light yo motherfuckin' way!
(So what's the number one cause of all these problems?)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
They say Luda would you rather have the money or the fame
I say they try to tell em that it all just depends
Cause everytime I make a lil more money
I seem to be losing more of my friends
So I'd give it all up to repeat life over
And they'd say dude is a fool
I can't trust another motherfucker living in this world
And this really got me losing my cool
What would you'd do if you were in my situation
And the minute everyone you ever loved to say you looked up
You drink your pain to the bottom of a bottle
And the Conjure would have you fucked up
So I'm looking for love in all the wrong places
Pop pills, drink liquor by the cases
Get high, make a woman get low
In the strip club looking for familiar faces
People know me on a first name basis
But all they ever really want is my cash
Let me borrow just a couple hundred dollars
And you know that I'm a pay you back, my ass
This world so superficial
This world done lost my trust
They say Ludacris you've changing
But I really don't give a fuck
What the hell am I suppose to think?
What the hell am I suppose to do?
I'm hearing that the devil's in disguise
And I'm hearing that the nigga look just like you
They know I walk throw the valley of the shadow of death
I don't go astray
And I get down on my knees and pray and I say

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green and Ludacris]
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away, away, away
I wish my problems would go away, away, away

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Doc said I need to change my diet, cause I'm really not eating right
Mama said I need some peace and quiet, cause I'm really not sleeping right
What's the use of having all the money
And the power in the world, if I can't abuse it?
Seems like the only thing that's keeping me together, is my music
If it wasn't for that, I think I would lose it
If it wasn't for that, I would go crazy
When nobody went good on they word
In the industry they make you feel like, "Fuck you, pay me!"
Cause I gotta feed family, some of the same ones that abandoned me
That still looking for a hand out
Til you found out there ain't shit ya handed me
Hah, still mad at me? But I'm trying to be the man I plan to be
But can't do it if you calling me for dumb shit
Thinking I'm innocent, I'm a plea insanity
Too many distractions and it feels like everyday
So I get down on my knees and pray and I say

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green and Ludacris]
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away, away, away
I wish my problems would go away, away, away

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I finally made it to the top of the CEO position
But when things don't go their way, these artists got all these suspicions
So the weed keep me at peace, and I think I need an intervention
Who the fuck put me in charge of making all of these decisions
My position got me stressing, like it never did before
Not to mention my best friend drowned and death was knocking at his door
And it seems like someone in my family is passing away like every day
So I just look up to the sky and get down on my knees and pray and I say

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green and Ludacris]
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away
(Okay, okay, okay) I wish my problems would go away, away, away
I wish my problems would go away, away, away

[Intro]
(Thugger, Thugger)
Chillin' at the top, cloud nine
Hundred cash, guap, I-I-I-I-I came a long way
(We got London on da Track)

[Verse]
I be chillin', I be chillin' all the way
Nigga winnin' all my diamonds black like Spades
I'mma hit it and then pass it to my bae
Nigga diamond water like a fuckin' lake
100k the day I caught a bitch straight out the Bay
100k the day I whip that sniff straight off the Bay
100k the day I fucked that bitch straight from the Bay
Cum-cum-cum all over her mothafuckin' face
I'mma get married anyway
I'mma hit it, yeah I'mma hit it just to say (ooh wee)
She, she plannin' on leaving me no, no way (ooh wee)
Aye, aye, ayeeee (ooh wee, ooh wee)
I-I-I came a long way (ooh wee, ooh wee)

[Hook]
Chilling at the top, Cloud 9
Only cash, guap, beside mine
Feel kinda rocky, I got a molly I'mma take off with nobody
Won't tell nobody if you give me some of that body
Oooooh, let me touch all over yo' body
She'll pay you if I touch all over her body
I will kill if you touch all over her body
Touch all over yo' body, touch all over yo' body

[Interlude]
Ooooh, ooh
I'mma touch all over yo' body, oooh
Aye, Nay bring me the lighter and a blunt

[Hook]
Chilling at the top, Cloud 9
Only cash, guap, beside mine
Feel kinda rocky, I got a molly I'mma take off with nobody
Won't tell nobody if you give me some of that body
Oooooh, let me touch all over yo' body
She'll pay you if I touch all over her body
I will kill if you touch all over her body
Touch all over yo' body, touch all over yo' body

[Outro]
I just wanna pay you, girl you make me pay
I just wanna pay you, sing my name like Tank
I just wanna pay you (chillin' at the top)
Hey, heyyyy, yeah
Pay you, pay you myself
I wanna pay you, pay you myself
I wanna pay you my damn self
I wanna pay you my damn self, for real (ooh wee)
FR ,for real (ooh wee)
FR , FR for real (ooh wee)
Ferrari for real (ooh wee)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Yeah, I used to care so much what people thought about me
Now I really could give a fuck
Not when I own over $15 million in real estate
And bought all the Fast & Furious trucks, haha
See, everyday I put in work and my salary grows
So excuse me I'm not caught up on reality shows
See the Bridges Family values on the south side
I live in Atlanta but do not have an Atlanta housewife
I'm not married, I've never been engaged
But your dumb-ass believes whatever's on the front page
See some of these bloggers don't even believe their own lies
Turn the computer screen into a mirror, look at'cha own lives
Cause technology exceeds all humanity
But there's a thin line between genius and insanity
Now private pics on my private, no longer private, man
Hope I can gets some privacy up on my private plane

[Hook: John Legend]
Ohhh, living in the spotlight
Oh if it's too hot, too hot tonight
I think I'm gonna take flight
But I'm a be alright, I'm a be alright
Let me live 'til I die

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I'm doing interviews
Getting asked the same questions from 10 years ago
Wondering to myself what the fuck I'm there for
Now that my daughter's a CEO at the age of 10
And I got restaurants inside Atlanta's airport
That repetition will drive any human being nutty
I'd rather be in my own crib, on my own couch
Thinking I gotta do what the fuck I wanna do money
Yeah, and then I went to Quincy Jones' house
Realize I didn't have shit, got some work to do
Soon as you get some money, it's gon' be someone with more than you
Sci-Fi movies, the fans said this album is overdue
And if you don't put some music out
These niggas gon' be over you
Talking about where that old Luda, for the rapper's sake
But Ursher told me if I don't evolve I'll evaporate
I've gotten better, motherfucker if you listen
If you're smart, and went to college better use your intuition

[Hook]
Ohhh, living in the spotlight
Oh if it's too hot, too hot tonight
I think I'm gonna take flight
But I'm a be alright, I'm a be alright
Let me live 'til I die

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Yeah, my own expectations I exceeded them
And when people say Luda's underrated, I'd agree with 'em
Jay said I'm so visual, they overlook the lyrics
But every verse you get a sample if your mind can clear it
Then steer it in the direction of your memory
And I'll be satisfied when I'm celebrated for centuries
Wrote a song for my girl she couldn't stand straight
My man said, "don't release it, you'll ruin your female fan base"
I said, "man, my female fan base gon' be here for forever"
Cause even though I'm with one, to them we're still together
And who am I to tell 'em different if my voice can freak 'em
Long as I can continue coming through all of that speakers
I'm a man of choice words but I speak the truth
And I ain't scared of shit except God in a life or jail suit
Especially when all of my bills are paid for
And God answered everything that I prayed for

[Hook]
Ohhh, living in the spotlight
Oh if it's too hot, too hot tonight
I think I'm gonna take flight
But I'm a be alright, I'm a be alright
Let me live 'til I die
Ohhh, living in the spotlight
Oh if it's too hot, too hot tonight
I think I'm gonna take flight
But I'm a be alright, I'm a be alright
Let me live 'til I die

[Intro]
In the year of 1994
A motherfucking earthquake just hit New York
You know what I'm saying
Earthquake is here
Straight up

[Verse 1: Earthquake]
I'm wrecking niggas like pencils on a piece of white paper
When I fuck up I can just use my eraser
Deck em, rub em' out and have much clout
Like Damon Wayans Bruce Willis on the Last Boy Scout
My pockets rollin' thick like a milkshake
I overflow the party cuz that shit says earthquake
I get on stage, start to rake em, I bake em
I use A-1 sauce and eat that nigga like steak-um
Earthquake is up when they come to 

[?]
I eat em' out like stuffin' on my microwave oven
I get the nack when I pack
A 3-5-7 in my sack
Cuz I'm short of a new jack
Aw heck, here's a peck on yo' cheek
I fold em and roll em' and dunk em like Dominique
I get the inspiration
When I see the girls in jubilation
Racing to my place and
Wanna touch my face
As I start to pace and race
Brush em' off like toothpaste
So think twice if you wanna step to this miss
I'll have ya burnin' like 

[?]
Hey up ya can't leave without no say so
If we were in Cuba, I'd take all ya pesos
So giddyup, this is earthquake on ya stereo
Fuck with me I leave ya soggy like some cereal
I'm gone, checkmate

[Hook]
Make a move like chess then checkmate
I make a move like check, nigga then checkmate
Move like chess, nigga, checkmate
I make a move like chess, nigga
Then I yell checkmate

[Verse 2: MF Doom]
Back as the invisible killer up on yo' screen
So get yo neck thumpin' between my guillotine
Checking magazine for X the unseen
Mad niggas know what I mean
I come clean as a whistle
Or filthy as my last pistol
Mine get you now- BUST
I get down to the bristle and burn em'
Like from up under the mistletoe
With the ho and she ain't even
Nasty like a flow- "check!"
Swish, i'm the suspicious, vicious X
So shit, i'm on a mish to gut this punk like a...
Yo probably wish I say like a fish
But busta how I front punk
I gut em' like a blunt
And my middle finger, index
And thumb, a bum from a bum nigga
A son of a gun
Squeeze the trigger I let looser
Looser than the bullshit ya used to
I jam like a tec' I am the slut seducer
Master of the zero harasser of yo' zip code
Disaster to the superhero, flipmode
In 93' I heard mad emcees that annoyed me
Like DTs on CDs
Checkmate

[Hook]
I make a move like that, then I yell checkmate
Makin' moves like chess, nigga, checkmate
I make a move like chess nigga then I yell checkmate
Makin' moves like chess, kid, checkmate

[Verse 3: Earthquake]
I cremate, dominate
Then sell some lemonade
10 cents a cup, little kid
Then I terminate like Arnold
Schwarzenegger
I am a little bigger
Ten shades darker than that
With the itchy finger
My whole game is a bible
I kill a nigga dead
With some lead
And put my head on his 

[?] bible
I swear to God I didn't do it
It's just another day of my life

[?] i'm sick and you niggas knew it
I'm crossing criss cuz i'm pissed
Time to diss

[?] for doing a motherfucking twist
I hid the body now it's over
The cops are havin' a really bad time finding that ass like a four leaf clover
So before you check me and try to do me
Quick, I kick ya ass just like Hong Kong-Phooey (CHIKA)

[Outro]
Checkmate
I just crossed the board and I got checkmate
I just crossed the board and I got checkmate
I just crossed the board and I got checkmate
I got the checkmate I got the checkmate

[Verse 1]
You've done me wrong
For a long, long time
But after all you've done
I never changed my mind

[Chorus 1]
Honey, please
Try to love me
Honey, please
Honey, try
My love
Will never die

[Post-Chorus]
Hmm-mm, hmm-mm-mm-mmm
Hmm-mm-mm-mmm, hmm-mm-mm-mmm
Hmm-mm, hmm-mm-mm-mmm

[Verse 2]
Flowers, flowers grow
Where I'm laid to rest
Honey, pick a blossom
And hold it, hold it
To your breast

[Chorus 2]
Honey, you know
That's my love
Burstin' loud
From inside
My love
Oh my love, my love
Will never die

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Dark matter with the sparks scattered up above, velvet hands in the upper glove—touch
Like bad double dutch, and two Amsterdam's ain't enough—D.R.U.G.S. 
"Don't ruin us," God said—DROGAS—too much pride we electric slide
We should be closer, like soca, not a chain, but a choker
I see the sun then the clouds then the vultures, pay respects in my sensei's sculpture
High as the angel on Dikembe's shoulder, eyes looking like MKUltra
Redacted vision through these dark shades, bad dreams through the screens of an arcade
Hangin' on the joy like the residues of heartbreak, park full of art, arteries full of parkay
Beating it, like new games, easily defeating
Or two gangs meeting for the evening, or two feet on a Riesling (Yeah!) slow wind
Meditate until there's no mind, decorate me with shine till I go blind
BDSM dominated it with no bind, safe word is "Don't stop," both, or don't go no times

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
Proceed to the next level
T.R.O.N
Proceed to the next level
T.R.O.N

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Coolest, tulips; flowers, fall from the towers
Like balls from Galileo to lay low, ignorance is that the world isn't ours—the gall!
Give them all showers, Tony found the fountain of youth, in the mountain of powder
To only find truth in the fountain, drownin' in power, surrounded with dollars
The moon surrounds us like spoons moving chowder—cut—that's a misdirect
To stir the soul with diseffect, names don't last like Mr. X, unless you Galilee
Droppin' bowling balls on the discotheque, with a disco ball hanging 'round your neck
Dance—it's a new year, every time I open my hands
Thoughts moving circles and the thoughts universal, yokozunas throwing salt in the circle
Sumo you up off off your turf boy, tsunami you up off your surfboard
Midas turn Medusas into gold, 'fore Versace turned words into turquoise
Medusa turned coke into stone with a hand on her thigh, she looked me in the eye and said—

[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco + Troi + Ab-Soul]
(Proceed to the next level)
Come so far, seen so much
T.R.O.N
I cannot settle for good enough
(Proceed to the next level)
So I'll sweat and I'll climb
T.R.O.N
Until I reach my prime
The forces rise and fall again
Through it all, I'll reach the end
(Proceed to the next level)
In my eyes, there's a fire
And it takes me high
Uh!
Yeah

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Soulo! Shoot for the moon, even if you miss, you'll be among the stars (Space)
Backstroke in my pool of thought but don't mind the sharks (Wavy)
Ab-Solar-system—intergalactic soldier (Uh)
Lupe say I'm a stoner—I said that I'm much bolder (Yeah)
Trapped in a game where the trap is the game, yeah (Word)
Scope this horror, Aquariuses make it rain here
No love for Your honor—only God can judge us, if you're Islamic, Allah (God!)
I've had it up to my collar with these niggas castin' stones like this Mancala (Uh)
Proceed to the next level, dig that with a platinum shovel—Black magic (Black magic)
Matter of fact—if matter is fact? A matter-factory is in the makin', perhaps
Uh, erase your database, we race against time, no time to set a date
Tetsuo & Youth-induced, too cool for school, unloose the noose and—

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco + Ab-Soul + Troi]
Proceed to the next level
Soul!
T.R.O.N. (T.R.O.N.! T.R.O.N.! T.R.O.N.!)
Proceed to the next level
T.R.O.N
Proceed to the next level
T.R.O.N. (T.R.O.N.! T.R.O.N.! T.R.O.N.!)
Proceed to the next level
(T.R.O.N.! T.R.O.N.! T.R.O.N.! T.R.O.N.! T.R.O.N.!)

[Outro: Troi]
We're going up, we're going up
Next level, next floor
I'm ready for it, I've been waiting all my life
(T.R.O.N., T.R.O.N.)
We're going up, we're going up
Next level, next floor
I'm ready for it, I've been waiting all my life
(T.R.O.N., T.R.O.N.)

You can try but I do fight

Now its like"oh,its him again!"i knew thats how you felt
Whats that'ass.i knew thats what i smelled...-
Theres a new sheriff in town,just been re-elected
You dont have to like it but respect it
Check it...-you can put on a vest,but ima still stop yah
Cause i gotta chopper sounding like a helicopter. you dont really want for me to pop the truck
Cause that mean i'll drop a chump when i cock and dump
Weather its Glock or pump,cats ain't ready
Half from here to here looking like spaghetti
Pull out the machette right off the lims
Bag up the pieces,wipe off the tims
Jump out the bens
Five cars deep
Four o'clock in the morning
Riders dont sleep
Shut shit down whenever we hit town
To getah nigga past just ain't my get down
You wantuh bring out the best,or bring out the worst'if you bring out the worst,ima bring out the hurse
Yall play poker but i play poker
Hit you from here to here and make me smile like the joker
... Dmx
... DMX
... DMX
... DMX
What they dont know
(man listen!)
Theyre gonn find out
(these cats must be out their fucking mind,babe!)

I don't know what,if anything,that you want me to do,but imma do...what it wants me to.....

(Verse)
Imma make it
Even though it looks rough
I've been a little scared, and sometimes shook up
When it's like that, all I gotta do is look up
Direct link to God, man I got the hook up
We go through what we go through, all for a purpose
We in the business of service
And most of y'all should've heard this
So whatever I do, Imma do to the best of my ability
Even if it's killing me, feeling me, that's the real of me
Some us got it, and some don't
Some stand for what they believe in, and some won't
Some us do wrong with no remorse
Some of us do wrong
See the light and change course
(chorus)

(Verse)
I don't ask questions I don't need to know the answer to
Cause at the end of the day, I know who imma answer to
There ain't none of us bigger than God
What it is the more dirt you've been through, the bigger the scars
The more hurt you've been through, the bigger you are
And you'll see it's bigger than what you figure you are
We're all part of the plan, and try to stay at the right side of the fence
With the devil riding you since you can remember
Sometimes, that's all you can remember
But it won't always be as cold as December
This storm comes to an end, they always do
But the word of God is always true..have faith

(chorus)

(Verse)
Looking back at life as it was
I see that I was right where I was
Right where I was, I was supposed to be
WITH God in my heart, and the devil close to me
He chose me to be an example to us all
And even if you stagger, you ain't got to fall
Well even if you fall down, you get back up
Whatever you think it is, it ain't that rough
Cause there's gonna be a time when enough is enoug
You get up cuz you're fed up, straight up, call the devil a bluff Cause ,hey, God is the glory I've been through it in his lies
Waiting to be saved by me TELL 'EM MY STORY!!!!!

[Intro]
Hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
See? I'm all about my wamables
See? I'm all about my wamables
(Hello, hello, hello, hello)

[Verse 1]
I'm all about my wamables
Nigga ain't bangable
I'm all about my wamables
These bitches is flammable
Bad bitches in the colleges
Bust it open for me, gynecologist
But watch all your mileages
Pussy miles go up if you’re talented
I'm all about pool life
Thong in my ass, make that nigga drool like
I'm all about good sex
Fake niggas gotta pay, gotta book sex
Real niggas get the pussy off GP
Real niggas get a feature on my EP
What the fuck you smiling for?
And what they put you on the panel for?
Where you gettin' money from?
Ayo Twist, where you get that Bentley from?
Clap, clap, clap, make it go around like a lap
Now put it in my lap
Let me see your crack, like the trap

[Chorus]
I'm all about my wamables
See? I'm all about my wamables
(Hello, hello, hello, hello)
I'm all about my wamables
See? I'm all about my wamables

[Verse 2]
I like percocets, I like to keep 'em hidden in my Birkin bag
Ass so fat, damn I'mma hurt 'em bad
It's showtime bitch, tell me break a leg
Couple Bushwick niggas, that'll break your leg
Push you off the balcony, and don't break a ledge
Put your hand up, now it's time to make a pledge
You'll never catch me, in a lightskin nigga bed
I'ma always keep the hammer, nigga fuck a sledge
Fuck what they be talkin' bout, fuck what they allege
I know them bitches gon' hate on my Giuseppe wedge (check)
Box spring cost 25k bitch
I'm out in Cali, fuckin' wit' the black K-fed
And nah man, I ain't fuckin' with that Jean Vest
Playtime been over fuck a recess
Playtime been over fuck a seesaw
Bitches wanna play a game? Go and see Saw
That's one, that's two, and that's three four
I'm hungry, who else could I feast off?
You know my pockets fatter, than that little Vine kid
They couldn't stop me, even if the red sign did
Bitch don't get gassed, like a hybrid
These bitches thinkin' they can do what I did
These bitches thinkin' they can live where I live
But bi-bitches couldn't see me with an eyelid
I mean look, your bitch came off an island
I came in the game '09 wilin'
I'm out in Hollywood, left off Highland
These bitches loud, but when the Queen come? (silent...)

[Chorus]
I'm all about my wamables
See? I'm all about my wamables
(Hello, hello, hello, hello)
I'm all about my wamables
See? I'm all about my wamables
(Hello, hello, hello, hello...)

[Intro: Nas]
Madonna, life is so crazy
You've been through a lot
I'll tell you stories sometimes, y'know?

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Seemed like yesterday, I was a baby on the street
I took a holiday, I was steppin' to the beat
I had to pay my rent, on the lower east side
I threw my tag around, let B-boys take me for a ride
I started writing songs, I kinda got into the groove
They tried to criticize my every single move
But then I realized I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise when I became the news

[Chorus: Madonna]
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as a northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

[Verse 2: Madonna, Nas]
(Talk to 'em, talk to 'em)
I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile
And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the borderline
And when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their mind
I justified my love, I made you say a little prayer
They had me crucified, you know I had to take you there
I opened up my heart, I learned the power of good-bye
I saw a ray of light, music saved my life (Music saved my life)

[Chorus: Madonna]
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as a northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

[Verse 3: Nas]
In 1994, I came through the door
With that born beats versus scratches
Verbally murdered rappers
My mom's from the Carolina's, pops from Natchez
And QB's where I started flowin'
But I was scared the cops was gonna kick my apartment door in
Had a baby girl by a crazy girl, then I got married
Heavily accosted, that ended in a bad divorce
I know how to pick 'em, don't I?
Never gave a fuck about public pressure
Or the ridicule, I'm too big to lose
Now who's the fool?
And I ain't never been happier, no lie
I'm just your humble servant, I'm Nas
If y'all burn down Ferguson, I'ma riot
My life cannot be compared to anybody
Any trappers, any rapper
Any politician, beautician, or musician
Anybody, saw many bodies
Many coffins, heads or tails
Penny tosses keep a man in jail
Not many options on the block I came from
And I turned to a rap messiah, spit rapid fire
And I roll right back to the block I came from

[Chorus: Madonna]
I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as a northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

[Outro: Nas]
Madonna on the track
Nas in the back
I woke up today
Feeling real fresh
Hopped out the 

[?] 8
Hit me the best tune, rep stacsk on deck
We ain't got 

[?] cash to make
I got a lot of swag to make
I got a lot of people to please
Sod still on those streets, still rest on me
Everybody still know that yellow piece, yes
Polo is the best
.players live once know their stress
Know they're stressed about the 

[?]
Ain't none but to get it
Ain; t none but to do it
I'm still so HD, swag to the max
Still got a hundred tats
Still got some people dressed in black
Ready to move, still got some people doing what they do
Yeah I do this shit
You know I got to stay fly
We move this shit
Everything is retro shit
Everything is retro shit

No pen no pad
I'm so smooth I got that swag
Bitch hit me on my phone
I was at home, on my motherfucking throne
King shit bitch
Smoking on kush yeah I like that shit
All that swag they like that shit
Like this shit on radio games, like nights and shit
I told the bitch I had a 

[?]
She ain't know what that was
These shoes that I got on, what that was
So fresh as fuck, hopped out that bus
I'm on tour, different city fuck all week I can't sleep

Yeah I do this shit
You know I got to stay fly
Everything is retro shit

[Hook]
I gotta make it out and move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
Bet this time around they won't scare me
I am the last one
"The champ"
Won't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front lines with my weapon
I am the last one

[Verse 1]
Damn
I went through it again
After telling everybody I wouldn't do it again
I kind of feel like I've let my people down
Yup
But to get them right
I gots to pick myself up
When I heard this beat and hook
It was so raw
Looked in the mirror
Didn't like what I saw
But all I could say was
Shits gotta change
(For real)
Either get it right or take one to the brain
If ya'll knew the pain that I went through daily
Trying to stay sane through the wind
Y'all hear me
I'm slipping, falling, I can't get up
But this time I'm out of control
I don't give a fuck
But for the thugs
I'm the last hope for the team
I'm the reason why some niggas
Got a hole in their dreams
These cats know what's good
I am the hood
I ain't hoping that they don't
I wish a nigga would

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I gots to do it for me
Do it for them
I ain't playing with this shit
I'm a' do it to win
Know I can do it again
Cause I did it before
With little to no effort
And Y'all niggas know the story
First album dropped in May
Second in December
Both were Platinum in one year like
Y'all don't remember
Only nigga who's first five albums
Debut at number one
Wonder why I call you son
My son, I've just begun
To get started up with the hardest part of it all
It's to climb a slippery wall and
Stil don't fall
Break down and call up to God
When it get too hard
I know you ain't gonna let me go now
Brought me too far
Showed me I was a star
All my life, I know it
All ain't right, before I call it a night
I'm a thank you for it all
The blessings and the curses
And I hope you're listening
Cause there's a lesson in the verses
Yeah

[Hook]

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Oddball, oddball
Baby girl you know that you's an oddball
Fuck with you you know that I'm an oddball
VVS' in my ears are golf balls (bling bling!)
Oddball, oddball
My money getting so old I need some moth balls
My motor's in my trunk I drive a weird car
I'm a trap star I'm labeled as an odd ball
Oddball, oddball
Body suit on like catwoman she know she ....?
And her booty so big it's hard to take her pants off
She an oddball she know that I'm an oddball

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Ain't it odd that I drive a Dodge I'm in love with Dodge
Got a Challenger and Charger and I'ma need a charge
For my Lamb and my green Ferrari and I missed a top
And her hips look like Nicki Minaj, smoke blunts with my Glock
Hickory Dickory, special delivery
A box full of currency it's Gucci I'm mailing me!
Allegedly I buy Ferraris and special accessories
No interior decorator but I got curtains in my Bentley jeep

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Oddball, oddball
Baby girl you know that you's an oddball
Fuck with you you know that I'm an oddball
VVS' in my ears are golf balls (bling bling!)

Body suit on like catwoman she know she ....?
And her booty so big it's hard to take her pants off
She an oddball she know that I'm an oddball

[Verse 2: OJ Da Juiceman]
In a Beemer
Odd ball with the lean-a
In a red two seater
On the pedal is a creature
Smoking thousand dollar reefer
Diamonds should be illegal
Freddy hit my phone, sent a hundred thousand Keishas
Quarter million dollars on an all orange Fisker
Body suit, catwoman, I had to go fishing
Somebody girl finna end up missing
Mean mugging us cause his bitch want pictures!

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Oddball, oddball
Baby girl you know that you's an oddball
Fuck with you you know that I'm an oddball

And her booty so big it's hard to take her pants off
She an oddball she know that I'm an oddball

[Verse 1]
I need the right one
With a bright imagination
Someone to talk to
Somebody patient
I want a cold piece
I want a love sensation
I want the mind first
I'll make the body wait for it (Wait for it)
You could be the right one
With a little dedication
Gotta make me follow through
Gotta make me chase it
Ohh, I want a stone groove
I want a love sensation
Someone to hold to
Someone to play with

[Chorus]
'Cause, lately
My whole being
Just wants
What it needs
And I don’t mind
(I need it
I just need, need, need)

[Verse 2]
I want the right one
Car keys and a cake dish
Gotta take that (Pipe work)
Gotta make me (Taste it)
I mean, amazin'
You want my last name (Say it)
Wanna have my baby (Say it)
I'll take you all places
I want the world stage
A certified classic
Big planes
Light baggage (Work)
I got a long reach (Work, work)
You got that good conversation (Work)
You such a cold piece
I wonder if you're taken

[Chorus]
'Cause, lately
My whole being
Just wants
What it needs
And I don’t mind
(I need it
I just need, need, need)
Say it, say it (I just) I need (Vamp)
Thick and FATBOI

[Verse 1]
These pussy niggas gettin' on my last nerves
How you a kingpin, but you ain’t havin' no birds
How you a killa nigga, and you ain’t even got no strap
How you a hustler, and you ain’t even got no trap
I run a nigga out the city, that's how that check work
Put so much hand on your head, it’ll make your neck hurt
And when it come to moving packs, man I’m a expert
I got a hole dug for you in the desert
So much cash and assets don’t know my net worth
I’m ridin' Ferraris, but I came through in that ‘vette first
A knucklehead little boy, my grandma say I need church
I need work and I’m the one that my plug feed first

[Hook]
So, don’t count me out, so, don’t count me out
My pride won’t let me wake up without me no check to count
So, don’t count me out, so, don’t count me out
You broke ass niggas ain’t gettin' no money want me to help you out
So, don’t count me out, so, don’t count me out
You know yo bitch fuckin' with me don’t let it stress you out
So, don’t count me out, so, don’t count me out
Fresh outta jail they done let me out, big Guwop, nigga check me out

[Verse 2]
Rolexes and Audemars, more chains than Mardi Gras (burrr)
Young niggas’ll hide your body parts, I’m strapped up right here by the bar
Fifteen years off with no license, still got money to buy a car
Yo bitch suckin' up all this flavor, she just wanna stand by a star
1017 nigga that’s my team and ain’t no fuckin' better squad
Ain’t nobody got wetter cars, ain’t nobody spit better bars
I’m shipping this coke and I’m whipping this dope and
I’m cooking it up and it’s hella hard, thinking of lies to tell a broad
Pulling up with yo baby mama
I crack yo jaw, I break the law
Having young niggas run in yo house
They’ll tape your mouth and rape your spouse
Blow your brains right on the couch
I am the six, I took some bricks
I hit some licks, I run the south
Take your wife won’t call you twice
You ain’t 'bout that life nigga catch me out

[Hook]

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Its Guwop, Bricksquad CEO Nigga

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I woke up six in the evening a bitch next to me
Last night went too hard on that ecstasy
And if I see that bitch tonight I never met the check
Y'all know I introduced the city to that flexin' shit
23 years old I met a Mexican
And all the profit that I made I invested it
Got a crazy whip game, I'm talkin' reckless bitch
Fucked up a 9 and a 4 tryn' to perfect the shit
I'm getting real good with it I got extra bricks
I got Canary yellow stones in my necklace
And when I walk in the club exit my foes exit it
Chop make your head spend around like the exorcist

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I got Dope Money, drop a bale on her
I'm turn her up and put YSL on her
What them hoes gonna say when I put that Chanel on her
We smokin' strong expensive perfume what you smell on her
I got Dope Money, drop a bale on her
Her nigga in the feds I hope they don’t tell on her
It ain't her fault that that nigga when to jail on her
And every time I pull up I be fresh as hell on her
(It's Gucci)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I look ya dead in the eyes, I despise your size
I got this pistol in the club bitch, surprise surprise
I recognize your disguise you bought a bag alive
I catch you on the east side bitch yo ass is mine
Say you triple OG, but you past your prime
Y'all niggas know you know me, I shoot you so many times
I used to drive an OD with the Daytona's
Sun valley Apartments, I swear that shit is like the Y
That AK hit his ass and he might survive
I'm not an umpire bitch I can't letcha slide
Came up in Zay basement and took it nation-wide
I'm in that citrus station with 50 Haitian guys

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I got Dope Money, drop a bale on her
I'm turn her up and put YSL on her
What them hoes gonna say when I put that Chanel on her
We smokin' strong expensive perfume what you smell on her
I got Dope Money, drop a bale on her
Her nigga in the feds I hope they don't tell on her
It ain't her fault that that nigga when to jail on her
And every time I pull up I be fresh as hell on her

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I if you a Blood got beef with Guwop I don't wanna be ya
If you a Crip got problems with me I wouldn't wanna see ya
LV's  all over me, no Vice Lord though I Louis V up
Big up to Jeezy but the twelve disciples they betrayed Jesus
RIP to MLK he was a born leader
Malcolm X man dat there, them my damn people
Its a revolution second graders smokin' reefer
And killin' people, God, deliver me from evil
My momma told me in the county jail in visitation
That shes not sad I took a life shes happy that I made it
I buried the trash they threw at me and now its my buried treasure
And every hurdle in life I leap, it make me more successful (Wop)

[Chorus]
Life so stressful, niggas they gone test ya
So Icey and you can't make a diamond without pressure
Just to wake up and breath, man I'm blessed for
I used to pay my momma rent with the extras
Dope man, bitch want a bag I got extras
Don't measure lean pour up, and don't measure
Dope man burry a mill, its buried treasure
Extra extra read about it, bitch I'm in the paper

[Verse 2]
Extra, extra, Gucci the dope stretcher
Extra, extra, homeboy in a stretcher
Finessed the college out a loan, dropped out the first semester (Fuck 'em)
Took 'em two-thousand and shelf, I bought a duece and I'm on Gresham
Guwop on the bricks too flexin, call me a wrestler (Lex Luger)
Wop does fourteen, fifteen, call me Chester Molester
I bought a fifty pack and put 'em back, ZayT on bricks (Zaytiggy)
And I'm not no producer, but these niggas gettin' remixed
I trick a six out my tour bust, crowned it with bricks, now its a Sprinter
Took a hundred pounds from ya just to smoke it with my niggas
Private jet, Guwop, the pilot call me "Mister"
Still the same nigga with two AR's on that picture (Pow pow)

[Chorus]
Life so stressful, niggas they gone test ya
So Icey and you can't make a diamond without pressure
Just to wake up and breath, man I'm blessed for
I used to pay my momma rent with the extras
Dope man, bitch want a bag I got extras
Don't measure lean pour up, and don't measure
Dope man burry a mill, its buried treasure
Extra extra read about it, bitch I'm in the paper

[Chorus]
Put yourself in my shoes
Sellin' weed since high school
Put yourself in my shoes
Rolls-Royce in my house shoes
Put yourself in my shoes
No one really likes you
They scared to stand beside you
Put yourself in my shoes
Put yourself in my shoes
Sellin' weed since high school
Put yourself in my shoes
Rolls-Royce in my house shoes
Put yourself in my shoes
No one really likes you
They scared to stand beside you
Put yourself in my shoes

[Verse 1]
Put yourself in my shoes
Whole lot of them tattoos
Put yourself in my shoes
Nothin but G's in my crew
Put yourself in my shoes
Have your ass with IVs
Have your ass in the trees, playin' round with my cheese
Once a billionaire bitch I may not be
Fuck what a player hater say about me
Bad bitches always lay around me
Gotta have an AK around me
Nigga like to play, but ain't playin' on me
Damn if a nigga say he layin' on me
I'mma keep a Glock here faithfully
When the police call, just say it ain't me
Your girl is a freak every day of the week
Take it or leave or leave it to me
You gave her a junkie, you gave her a key
You can give her a whip, but don't give her to me
Some of these niggas be breakin' her off
Some of these niggas be fuckin' her free
Hatin' is rampant, it's like a disease
'95 Air Max on my feet (Gucci!)

[Chorus]
Put yourself in my shoes
Sellin' weed since high school
Put yourself in my shoes
Rolls-Royce in my house shoes
Put yourself in my shoes
No one really likes you
They scared to stand beside you
Put yourself in my shoes
Put yourself in my shoes
Sellin' weed since high school
Put yourself in my shoes
Rolls-Royce in my house shoes
Put yourself in my shoes
No one really likes you
They scared to stand beside you
Put yourself in my shoes

[Verse 2]
Better check yourself 'fore you wreck yourself
Better cool your tone, better watch your step
Shoulda brought your tone, gotta use your phone
You gambled with your life, you done bet yourself
God bless my health and increase my wealth
All my energy, and all my breath
Gotta lotta enemies, don't wear skinny jeans
I'm a stylist of a star cause I dress myself
Don't need your help, I can dress myself
Gotta big gun, I protect myself
You niggas better come like a hundred deep
Cause there's 200 shots in this shit here
Pistol talkin' loud and clear
Tryna make it disappear
Ain't come to fight, ain't come to talk
I came to get you outta here
Pussy niggas don't keep it real, faker than a three-dollar bill
2004 was such a year, I think I sold 10 million pills
Pushing weight, I body build
Vacuum sealed a couple mil
Plug just sent so many bills
I'm walking in the club and I brought my scale!

[Chorus]
Put yourself in my shoes
Sellin' weed since high school
Put yourself in my shoes
Rolls-Royce in my house shoes
Put yourself in my shoes
No one really likes you
They scared to stand beside you
Put yourself in my shoes
Put yourself in my shoes
Sellin' weed since high school
Put yourself in my shoes
Rolls-Royce in my house shoes
Put yourself in my shoes
No one really likes you
They scared to stand beside you
Put yourself in my shoes

Don't hit my line if you ain't gon' buy something

[Verse 1]
All that gold in your mouth, boy you thugged out
I'm not a maid, but I clean out the gambling house
She said, "Gucci, out, take it out, ouch ouch"
Rich nigga beat your back out on Versace couches
Got my sleeves on, got my top off
Her nails ain't pressed on, her hair ain't snatching out
They say I'm tacky yellow, white jewelry mismatching now
Money bulgin' out my Diesel khakis, yeah, it's bulgin' out
Miss lady say she know me
I'm ballin' like Ginobili
She say I fucked her in east LA, man that's just what she told me
She suck me till my toes curl, I asked her "Whatcha owe me"
Said "Wop don't owe her nothing man, but beat it like I stole it"
Sitting at the Floyd fight, Golden Boy Promotions
Said you signed to Def for what? Man I put that on my Rolly
Got them black All Stars on me, like a OG
Had a black Bentley, now it's red on Forgi’s

[Chorus]
Maybe it's the juice
Maybe it's the juice
She want to get loose, so I let her drink the juice
Double deuce, double cup, pour a fo' or two
Sliding in the coupe, half a pint in my apple juice

[Verse 2]
My first gun was a double deuce
Who got the juice? Who got the Juice? I'll throw you off the roof
I'm Gucci Lion rastafari, and I fuck with Snoop
Im Uncle Gucci, K.O.D. got hoes like Uncle Luke
You in a weak crew nigga making checkers moves
Chess moves, Tim Duncan, nigga vet moves
So many snakes in the grass, bought a mongoose
I camouflaged my Foamposites like some jungle
It's Gucci

[Chorus]
Maybe it's the juice
Maybe it's the juice
She want to get loose, so I let her drink the juice
Double deuce, double cup, pour a fo' or two
Sliding in the coupe, half a pint in my apple juice

Dope money, yeah, sloppy bread
Ten slices of bread

[Verse 1]
Big Guwop, sloppy bread, waffles with cheese
Better believe I still got that big MAC on me
I'm unguardable, you need to put Shaq on me
I need to fumigate, mosquitos love to suck on me
I need some rat traps, too many mice 'round me
I'm a compulsive gambler, don't bring no dice 'round me
I'm a robber, I'll rob ya blind, don't take your eyes off me
I'm a kleptomaniac, don't leave your bitch 'round me
I'm the same Gucci Sosa, influenced Chief Keef
With a suit and twenty chains, doin' a mixtape with Scream
I'm the same Gucci, nigga, in the hood with the plan
If you niggas want some soft, you need to shit on your hands
Its Gucci

[Chorus]
I tell it like it is, 'cause this the life I live
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest nigga ever lived
Bad bitch in the crib, pints in the fridge
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest nigga ever lived
These rappers rap fugazi shit, but Gucci's diamonds real
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest rapper ever lived
I'm a multi-millionaire, and yet I kill rob and steal
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest trapper ever lived

[Verse 2]
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest nigga ever lived
In my old school with the digital dash 

[?]
I got friends all in Japan, but I was born in Birmingham
I'm sellin' Cali Kush if thats my Alabama, I'm the man
Dope in Alabama, damn its one-hundred a gram
I cooked so many graham crackers, think that I'm an elf
Two-thousand pounds of mid g, and I sold that shit myself
I'm on 

[?] Ave and Moreland, this shit hot as hell
My trap house dope goin' HAM, honey day
VVS white boogers fighting for space, crammed in my Rollie's face
Your wife looking stupid, God damn never seen a Rollie face
Yeah, she seen one, but none like the one Gucci wore yesterday

[Chorus]
I tell it like it is, 'cause this the life I live
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest nigga ever lived
Bad bitch in the crib, pints in the fridge
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest nigga ever lived
These rappers rap fugazi shit, but Gucci's diamonds real
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest rapper ever lived
I'm a multi-millionaire, and yet I kill rob and steal
Gucci Mane, I'm the realest trapper ever lived

I'm 'bout to fly to Belgium, because I need a vacation
Me and your bitch, we had relations
I fucked that bitch at central station
Sippin' on mud, in a crowded ass club
With a bitch I don't know, and a nigga don't like
If I'm a bitch nigga, then call me out
If my bond 1Mil, Waka get me out

Sippin' cough syrup, no damn cough
Servin' bricks, I never ran down
But I'll kill a lil nigga if he ran off
Smokin' on a blunt of that medicated
Baby daddy say he devastated
Police pulled over my Bentley, baby
Whole pound of gas got confiscated
Sippin' on mud, it's concentrated
My whole life story been complicated
Your baby mama infatuated
And your new girlfriend is fascinated
Lortab, mixed it with a Roxy
Cialis pill, with a Molly

All my drugs are designer drugs
My drugs cost a whole lotta money
All my clothes are designer clothes
They come from a whole 'nother country

[Hook]
People say I'm crazy, I might need some medication

I took one step forward and two steps back
I jumped so many hurdles to get where I'm at
I had one foot out and I had one foot in
And I ain't gonna look back if I get one more chance
And it's one thing that a nigga must understand
That tomorrow's not promised, this is your last dance
And I'ma leave my past with this one line
Try to live your life one day at a time (it's Gucci)

[Verse 1]
Now our bills anything
Then why I'm still hurting then?
My cousin said, "it's not a house Gucci
So why the fuck it got a curtain then?"
I applied for a job once
Really went with the workin'
But soon as I got the work in
It seemed niggas started hatin'
I wasn't good ridin' skateboards
I was better ridin' Daytons (yeah)
I can't lie I need to pray for it
But it took a lot of patience

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
All my listeners need to listen up
Because I'm rich as fuck
No petitioner my peninsula
Imma finish her perpendicular
Whats a pencil for?
What the pistol for
Get the rental car
I'm not into her
Talking shit to her
Strapped with a suit like a minister
I'm sinister, grab your sister dismember her
Dropping damage on screamin fuck the law
Smoking out the jar
Hating on me ain't gone get you very far
And my doors ajar, fucked your mom
Woke up in a jar
If I fucked her raw, coulda been ya pa'
Shining like a star
You a fraud
Made the crowd applaud
Gotta thank the lord
For my boy, brick squad
Money over broads

[Hook]
Mob shit mob shit
Get a nigga wild quick
All my niggas hittin licks
All my bitches sell bricks

Mob shit Mob shit
Get a nigga robbed quick
All my niggas hittin licks
All my bitches sell bricks

I can't indulge in that
The bitch try to hug me I won't hug her back
I can walk through this bitch for like 35 racks
Promoter say he never seen a club so packed
I got racks on racks I got tatts on tatts
Think I took steroids when you check my stats
A 20million dollar bitch when I met my match
Rolling stone where my homies lay I laid my hat
Fuck a home got a ??? with 15 straps
15 people dealing gotta sell this crack
Cold hard as the ??? that is on my lap
A weak link in the chain holding too much slack
(Wop!)

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
You're copycat, get back
I'm always on your mind
Take a photograph like that
Always ahead of my time
I'll give you a heart attack, bumbaclat
Where is my royalty?
You're a pretty girl, I'll give you that
Stealing my recipe

[Chorus]
Here we go again, in your fantasy
You can try it all, but you can't be me
You can walk the walk, even talk the talk
But you'll always be two steps behind me
In my shadow, two steps behind me
Out of ammo, you're never gonna be on my level
Two steps behind me
In my shadow, you're just a wannabe me

[Verse 2]
Like a sister all messed up
Who's gonna help you out?
It's an ugly look, princess
What are you all about?
Did you study me hard enough, trying to be a boss?
Yeah, that's cool and all, now get in line
Tickets are gonna cost

[Chorus]
Here we go again, in your fantasy
You can try it all, but you can't be me
You can walk the walk, even talk the talk
But you'll always be two steps behind me
In my shadow, two steps behind me
Out of ammo, you're never gonna be on my level
Two steps behind me, in my shadow, you're just a wannabe me
Never gonna be me, just a wannabe me
Just a wannabe me, never gonna be me, just a wannabe me
Here we go again, in your fantasy
You can try it all, but you can't be me
You can walk the walk, even talk the talk
But you'll always be two steps behind me
In my shadow, two steps behind me
Out of ammo, you're never gonna be on my level
Two steps behind me, in my shadow, you're just a wannabe me
Never gonna be me, just a wannabe me
Just a wannabe me, never gonna be me, just a wannabe me
Just a wannabe me

[Intro]
This is the final piece of the puzzle

[Verse 1]
Where you going? Slow it
Don't act like you don't see me, I'm glowing
Show me what you look like in the morning, tone it on it
Floating on 25's, I wouldn't be fly if I threw some D's on it

[Pre-Chorus]
From the center to the floor, I'm fresh low-key
When I step through the door all eyes on me
Wanna be a star, get on TV
It's 'bout to jump off in my car so come with me (Oh, baby)

[Chorus]
Hey, girl, I love what you do (Yeah)
The way ya making it move, I'm tryna give it to you (Oh, haha)

You gotta show me, if you with it, be a bad girl

[Pre-Chorus]
From the center to the floor, I'm fresh low-key (Low-key)
When I step through the door all eyes on me (On me)
Wanna be a star, get on TV

Hey, girl, I love what you do

[Verse 3]
Seven-hundred horsepower, speakers beating down the block
Girls stop, automatic static, better call the cops
Bad chick, looking like she finna let me grab it

[Intro]
Yeah (Ho!)

[Verse 1]
I'm finally fed up with the run around chase and cut
So I hung my jersey up, turned in my playas card (Mmm, ho!)
The boy faced the facts, I'm a man now, done with that, finally learned how to act
And in fact it's 'cause of who you are, so glad that I found you (Ho!)

[Chorus]
So glad, so glad
So glad, I found you (So glad)
So glad, baby
So glad that I found you
So glad, you made me (So glad)
So glad, brand new, yeah (So glad)
So glad
Baby, I'm so glad that I found you

[Verse 2]
Hey, you caught me up, when I stop, you start me up
When a brother got low, got me up  and I'd be up, stuck, girl, girl, hook me up
And not to be cliche (Cliche) but I'm the Clyde to your Bonnie (Bonnie)
My good day (Hey), just the way you do, makes me so damn glad that I found you

[Chorus]
So glad, so glad
So glad, I found you (So glad)
So glad, baby
So glad that I found you
So glad, you made me (So glad)

And I ain't going nowhere from you, trust me
Now that I got you, baby
I love the way that you care for me, honey (Yeah)
I love the fact that you're there for me, honey (Ooh)

[Intro: Rico Love]
(I see the light)
Yo, uh, just feel real good right here, man
It's a good look, sugar bear, it's love
(I see what's wrong)
Young Chris, Gucci what up?
(See all the things I've heard about)
From the streets of V.A
Talk to the whole world, man
(See all the things I've read about)
Ghetto America, talk to 'em, man (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
(I've seen the light)

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
It's been a struggle for me
Wondering why I can't get by with my life
But now I'm free
And I done did some right and wrong but still I seen the light
And I done been around the sex and drugs
Hustling but mama ain't raise no thug
And it took a little to see
How real it could get and how this life wasn't meant for me 'cause I

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Seen a lot of bad things on my block
But I ain't wanna be a victim of a gunshot
I can't let nothing hold me down

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
See all the things I heard about (Woo)
See all the things I've read about (Woah, oh)
I seen the light (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
It's kinda hard for me
To stay away from all these girls and the haters, they don't like
That I'm fulfilling my dream
But I'm just tryna do my thing, my nigga, can't I live my life?
I got the world on my shoulders (Shoulders)
And I'm only getting older (Older)
But it's like it's getting colder
I'm gon' make it but I can't take it sometimes

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I came a long way from my block
And I'm grateful for everything I got
I didn't let nothing bring me down

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
See all the things I heard about (Ooh, yeah)
See all the things I've read about
I seen the light

[Interlude: Chris Brown]
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah
Wow, huh man, after all this, who woulda thought? (Yeah)
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah
Little boy from Tappahannock, Virginia
Y'all know what I'm saying? Would make it all the way to the top

[Verse 3: Rico Love]
Life is vivid but seen through the eyes of a righteous spirit
They try to show us the light but we don't like to hear it (Don't like to hear it)
Mama told me I was bright but despite her lyrics
A large heard across my sight, I had to fight to clear it (Uh, uh)
Like a runner, a couple of summers, I often wondered if it
Really was winter and that's when I heard the thunder
A current was occurrin', it was stirrin' up my hunger
But I couldn't let the **** bury a ***** under (Don't let it)
Used to cry hopin' all of this would pass
And then I learned to use my tears to water up the grass
A part of my swag but apparently I've won
'Cause I took my shades off and now I'm starin' at the sun
(See all the things I've heard about)
I'm seein' the light, I'm seein' the light
Uh, realizin' that it's me in the light
(See all the things I've read about)
I read about it (Read about it)
Heard about it (Heard about it), and now I know (Woo!)
(I've seen the light)

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
I coulda did wrong
I seen a lot of people hustle but I left them things alone
I almost lost my friend to the struggle
But I guess that made me strong, made me strong
I seen a whole lot of drama and it taught me how to fight
Taught me how to fight
And I thank God for my mama, she showed me what was right
I coulda been in the dark, but thank God for the light
(I seen the light) I seen the light

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
See all the things I heard about
All the things I've heard about
See all the things I've read about
I've read about it, I've read about it, oh
I seen the light
I see the light, I see the light

[Intro: Noah]

Hop out like a G, say, "Pleased to meet you
Can we elope and go smoke somewhere peaceful?"
It's the N.O.AH, baby, kiss me, hug me
The music man, girls they love me (They love me)

Baby, I'm a player but the ball's in your court (Uh, uh)

So baby, use your brain and take advantage of the chance (Haha, yeah)

[Intro]
This one right here, goes out to my mama
This goes out to mama
Your mama and everybody mama, haha
Here we go, listen, listen

[Verse 1]
I remember Saturday mornings
Me waking up to mama in the kitchen cooking to Sam Cook
And I was just a young dude, watching morning cartoons
Waiting for mama to braid my hair
I used to hate to get it done 'cause she'd braid it too tight
My mama always gave a style, she knew I would like
And then I would go outside and play, she'd sit on the front porch
While me and Rob played ball

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama always did little things like that
Mama always will know I love her for that
For all the things that you used to do
Mama, I dedicate this one to you

[Chorus]
It's straight from the heart, this is your song
You're my lucky charm so you already know
That I'ma sing this one for you
So let me sing this one for you
From every tour, every show
You're my lucky charm, go wherever I go
Mama, I'ma sing this one to you
Mama, let me sing this one to you

[Verse 2]
She's like the mother of Tappahannock, VA (VA)
Everybody knew miss Joyce where we stayed (Where we stayed)
Old heads said she was cool, nothing that she wouldn't do
What about CB? She was known I acted a fool
(Oh, woah) With the little money that she made
She took the bad and made it all okay
Nights at the daycare, when we had to stay there
Always held it down, so I gotta thank you now

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama always did little things like that (Oh)
Mama always will know I love her for that (Ayy)
For all the things that you used to do
Mama, I dedicate this one to you

[Chorus]
It's straight from the heart, this is your song
You're my lucky charm so you already know
That I'ma sing this one for you
So let me sing this one for you
From every tour (From every tour, yeah, yeah, yeah), every show
You're my lucky charm, go wherever I go (You're my lucky charm)
Mama, I'ma sing this one to you (I'ma sing it, just let me sing it)
Mama, let me sing this one to you (Woah, yeah)

[Bridge]
(Ooh) Mama, I thank you for all you've done
(Ooh) I thank God everyday I'm your son
Oh (Yeah), you gave me everything that I need
But loving me unconditionally
Everybody say "M-O-M-M-A"
Everybody say mama
"M-O-M-M-A"
You know that this is your song

[Chorus]
It's straight from the heart (Oh, mama), this is your song (Ayy)
You're my lucky charm so you already know
That I'ma sing this one for you
So let me sing this one for you
From every tour (Ayy), every show (Mama, I love you so)
You're my lucky charm, go wherever I go (Wherever I go)
Mama, I'ma sing this one to you (Yeah)
Mama, let me sing this one to you

[Outro]
This right here goes out to every mama all over the world
Mama, I know I might be bad at times

You always gonna be my mama
Mama, mama, my mama
(Mama, I'ma sing this one to you)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
(Mama, let me sing this one to you)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Mama, I love you
Don't put nothing above you
I'll save it, I'll save this one for you
It's kinda crazy I feel this way
Baby I'm sayin, the kinda man that I've come to now

But babe I got alot to say

If you get to know me (Oh), baby, it'll be a really good thing

Immigrant parents but
I'm living the American dream for them now
It's it's it's about to go down
This is for Eddie, Bobby, Rudy, Johnny
Up in the sky drinking voli lodi dodi
I don't need a Maybach or Buggati
Couple of beds with some sheets, that's a party
Go DJ, head blow the speakers
All my women wear heels, no sneakers
Grim reaper, the night is mine
Meet me at 11:59

[Chorus: Vein]
Everybody rise

[Intro: PeeWee Longway]
Dun Deal on the motherfuckin' track
Thugger, Quan
Ya'll know what's happenin'

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
If we get locked up by the night
I know those folk gone try and hold us
Got grams for niggas on white
And we keep seals for niggas who poured up
Trappin' all night in skinny jeans, got a bankroll that won't fold up
Shootin' at niggas like they cameraman and that what we call exposure
And we get locked up by tonight I know those folk gone try and hold us
Got grams for niggas all white, and we keep seals for niggas who poured up
Living life never sober
My ring looking like a solar
And if we get locked up by the night, I know those folks gone try and hold us

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan + Young Thug]
Five bitches tryna jump me in the night and I can't say hold up
Big B's lifestyle, Thugger need two bucks
I can't treat a bitch like a queen, I don't even know her
She slime ain't nothin' I'mma show her
Pull up in the Bentley, no chauffeur
Backwood, MPA smoke campus
White bitch drive a black beamer, have you seen it?
White bitch kiss white bitch, did they mean that?
I know those hoes ain't mean that
This year, a whole lotta cash made shit a whole lotta cash man
I need a first aid kit along with band aid
You know why?
Thug bleed like a motherfuckin' vampire
More carrots then a motherfuckin' damn pie
OG is what i smoke by
Fingernails got fungi, fungi
I'm a real nigga, you a fun guy
Runnin bands up without Illuminati
You better off coachin' in syri

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
If we get locked up by the night
I know those folk gone try and hold us
Got grams for niggas on white
And we keep seals for niggas who poured up
Trappin' all night in skinny jeans, got a bankroll that won't fold up
Shootin' at niggas like they cameraman and that what we call exposure
And we get locked up by tonight I know those folk gone try and hold us
Got grams for niggas all white, and we keep seals for niggas who poured up
Living life never sober
My ring looking like a solar
And if we get locked up by the night, I know those folks gone try and hold us

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan + Young Thug]
I don't talk to 12, I don't like conversation
Heard my nigga Pee got them bails all across the nation
Smell it before you taste it
Last time I went to jail, I beat all my cases
Mail, that's a risk you takin'
Ever since she found my cell, she been wearing on my patience 
You can throw that bitch in water, but you still can't save her
Bitches  fuckin if you famous (Rich Homie, baby)
And you know I can't forget about

I'm with PeeWee and double trouble, tool box, drill these bitches
Who got 20 tissues? I'm shittin' on ya'll
And we workin', even though 12 is lurking

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
If we get locked up by the night
I know those folk gone try and hold us
Got grams for niggas on white
And we keep seals for niggas who poured up
Trappin' all night in skinny jeans, got a bankroll that won't fold up
Shootin' at niggas like they cameraman and that what we call exposure
And we get locked up by tonight I know those folk gone try and hold us
Got grams for niggas all white, and we keep seals for niggas who poured up
Living life never sober
My ring looking like a solar
And if we get locked up by the night, I know those folks gone try and hold us

[Verse 3: PeeWee Longway]
Out there we juggin', play those houses turn them bitches to the trenches
Trappin', ninja Givenchies, bankrolls on me ain't (bending)
In them velcros just sippin'
How the hell I'm trippin'?
No prescription for this medicine, how the hell I'm sippin'?
One button I'm pushin', Audi A7 or 80
Deviled up and I'm Kid Cudi ghost ridin' with you lady
Sucking on my dick like 8 Mile, She choke her like Slim Shady
40 pointers on my pinky ring, fuck 12 cause they know they hatin'
Longway

[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
If we get locked up by the night
I know those folk gone try and hold us
Got grams for niggas on white
And we keep seals for niggas who poured up
Trappin' all night in skinny jeans, got a bankroll that won't fold up
Shootin' at niggas like they cameraman and that what we call exposure
And we get locked up by tonight I know those folk gone try and hold us
Got grams for niggas all white, and we keep seals for niggas who poured up
Living life never sober
My ring looking like a solar
And if we get locked up by the night, I know those folks gone try and hold us

[Verse 1]
All my bitches say I act so numb
'Cause I got four birds on Christmas
I got so many birds stuffed in a rental
I might get one of them fucked off in a bando
Hey bro, we got a lot of work to do bay
I not gonna let her get in my head like crochets
I got a habit of buying my kids all the new J's
I'm just boolin' in that Phantom drinkin' on bool-aid
Okay Boo, okay motherfuckin' Boo
Let's break the rules, if I don't know you niggas, you food
Ayy, grab that tool, that Lil Mexico, that wooly, wooly, wooly
Been through hell, but I'm God's gift like Kooly, Kooly
Shout out to Skooly, Skooly
My life the truthest, truthest, woah
I'm just bickin' it with my bloods and we boolin', boolin'
A motion picture, picture my life is a movie, movie, movie
Like Shaq feet, y'all been gay
But I hope my career will take me a long way
A long way, a long way

[Chorus]
She went and tell her friend about the way I'm hitting it
She tell her friend she rock nothin' but them Jimmys
She tell her friend she was never in them Remy's
She like how the hell you put fifty-thousand in these skinnies?
Now I'm for real, I'm for real, I'm for real, I'm for real, I'm for real

[Verse 2]
Now I'm a boss you gotta keep me out your business
And when I hit it, I'ma get inside her kidney
I drink that lean all day, I don't have no limit
And just like Master P, change the Alley boy image
These niggas singing on they partner without a Grammy award
I'm in that 2015 fish with the sign like a fork
Yeah, and then that Masi
I rap for myself, I don't really rap for anybody
My real name Jeffrey and I ran around the lobby
I got a hundred thousand packs, who wanna buy it?
I get a geek, she be sneakin' on that molly
And I'm swagged the fuck out, I don't need a stylist

[Chorus]
She went and tell her friend about the way I'm hitting it
She tell her friend she rock nothin' but them Jimmys
She tell her friend she was never in them Remy's
She like how the hell you put fifty-thousand in these skinnies?
Now I'm for real, I'm for real, I'm for real, I'm for real, I'm for real

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]

It's Young Thug bitch
(ROC Crew forever)
My world
(We went from cheese to cheddar)
Try not to get putted out

[Verse 1]
Hop out the G4, now I'm back to the basics
I thank God that I am not racist
Shout out to Wayne cause he is not basic
He got me on my turtle time, no Matrix
And I promise I'll ball, no patriot
And I'll be at the finish line, slick waiting
Which is at the tip top, big Akron
But if I fall off I'll die, so I'm pacin'
And I've been in and out the bank bitch
While ya'll assholes been in and out a tank bitch
I think I'm on my Wayne cake shit
But we smoke the same weed, the Wayne stank shit
And I'm the top tire, no innertube
And I'll eat till you're sour, like lemon food
Cause I'm the motherfuckin' boss and you're a middle dude
And you're just like the bricks, we get rid of you
And I should make a pledge of allegiance
Cause these niggas small, they ain't in my region
I stay away from ya'll when you niggas this bleedin'
Cause I don't know if you know me like I'm takin' the pleadin'
We in the buildin', the niggas that are outback

And I'm the boss so, yea I Marshall Faulk that (I run it)
And my partner on my falkjack

And I be in the motherfuckin' sky, don't fly
And if I can't stay around ya, I'mma run right through ya
But if you get right bitch, I might new, new ya

[Interlude]
Yea, it's Thug, I have prison bars (Do the math)
Concrete jungle and shit

Long, long time ago, I promise you

[Verse 2]
Money on your head, now you need a paper proof roof
Niggas at me, man I need a bulletproof booth
And what ya'll call goons, we call goof troops
And them hoes we smashin', ya'll call 'em new, new
Ridin' with the 50 cal, old man protected
How the song got Universal still neglectin'?
Oops I mean select me
Skooly didn’t forget me
I fuck with Juugman shit, respect he get plenty
And I be with my dogs like a hunter
We be blowin' racks while they starvin' out for hunger
And they say I look good, but I'm mean, sexy monster
They wanna make me mad but Ty told me to stay humble
And they ask me why I still respect Jimfro
Cause he the motherfucker that made me, is you crazy?
And he asked me why I had two babies
Cause I ain't lettin' a fuck nigga clone me, is you crazy?
But if a nigga play with them babies
He gone need the motherfuckin' army and the navy
Cause the ROC crew move by the babies
And we got a 1000 guns in Haiti
And Skooly hopped out the Porsche
And I be ridin' round lurkin', me and your dad
Or should I be sayin' the zan man kids?
Cause we be high like the school at Harvard of Spanish, ya dig?

[Outro]
Thank God that I am not basic..

[Verse 1: Young Thug]

You try and tell me that I'm boyfriend number two
But I don't wanna be your boyfriend number two
I want the one spot and for that I'll murk dudes

Plus when you with your friends, you be callin' me bums
I had to tell you ma, you know I like her son
You callin' it (?)
I love when we fight then fuck each other
Try to bluff each other, we try to cuff each other
But there were still others that we call lovers
That fuckboy was named Danny like Glover
You probably gave him head, that's why I never ever kissed you
You gone 10 minutes and I already missed you
That nigga dissed you, I never dissed you
I would've kissed you, that nigga bit you
With teeth pistol, or a tooth chopper
And I was your doctor, call me doctor Thug
I kept clean shoes on your feet like I used scrubs
I had niggas lookin' at me like (?)
I had them heels hot like they was made inside of mugs
That pussy stay wet like an ocean tub
Can't forget them days baby
When that guy hit you, came over to face me
Fifty guns, you were the navy
If I were actin' all lazy
I can't forget them times baby
But now it's time baby
I got me a new ho and she's fine like wine
I call her prison clock cause she has no time
To even play by anything
She like baby lets go get the ring
Matchin' tats that say prince and queen
And if them niggas play you better, spray they heads like oil sheen
So therefore I gotta spray your head like oil sheen

[Interlude: Young Thug]

[Outro]
To all my niggas dead and gone

It's all on me, it's all on me, it's all on me

[Intro: Teezie Dolla]
Hey Thug, what they say homie?
Check this out right, bein' broke, that's bad for my health, right?
I got so much of this shit, I signed myself
All I want you to do right now, I want you to talk to these folk
And tell 'em how I really live, right?
'Cause we havin' so much money right now...

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
And I'm Su Woo but I wrote this with a blue pen
And this the movement, please join in
And they like "Thug really do this"
And I'm lucky to tell y'all this the blueprint
And I wonder why they hatin' on me
I guess the ice got they main bitches skatin' on me
Maybe my car 'cause the next year's datin's on it
TIP, I'm a young king, please put the cape on me
Thug go in, curfew
I'm on a lot of tracks, they say the Thug startin' to irk you
And y'all eatin' shit that's baby food, burp you
If Wayne flow is kush, then my shit is on purple
But my flow is sick, it's dyin', I need a donor
And I'm so great, when I leave I need a cloner
I didn't ride a wheel so that Phantom gon' need an owner
And your ho be totally screamin', she's not a moaner
I told Wayne I was ready for the paper like Usher
He said cool, sit back, stay away from busters
Now Thug got the big head, I am a gusher
I am not the best but I am better than others

[Chorus: Young Thug]
And I know you believe in me
And I'm at the top, you shall achieve with me
And I'm not gonna stop so you'll succeed with me
I have your body frozen, your degrees with me
And I know you believe in me
And I know, you know, I know you'll succeed with me
And I know, you know, I know you'll achieve with me
I have your body frozen, nigga freeze with me

[Verse 2: Teezie Dolla]
I'm at the tip top, ain't no toppin' me
I want the whole thing, now watch me re-rock a key
And I ain't wanna flex, so I called bee-bee
Sippin' on this mud got me bobbin' and leanin'
I hopped out the porch just like Skooly
Me and Young Thug on this one, it's a movie
Pull up in that drop, his mouth drop like droopy
Now they sayin' I got the big head like Stewie
I took a break from the rap for a reason
Now I ride drop head flyin' down Cleveland
Whoever thought me and my crew be ridin' horses
Panoramic car, that mean back to back Porsches
They said I fell off 'cause I ain't brought the new whip through
But when I bring it back, I'ma paint that bitch crip blue
And still post up on the ave with my boy big blue
And a hundred young niggas and they all screamin' Su Woo
I went to church just to chill in the pulpit
And Mario got shot, yea that's still some bullshit
But Thug, I can't let it handle you
I'ma take you off to Cleveland, aka the Zoo

[Bridge: Young Thug]
And my bitch look like a barbie
I have a new spot, Houston no Marcus
Nigga you don't wanna start it
Lil Tee bring the troops, we the sergeants
Ride the beat like a ROC crew Harley
And if y'all ballin' with the bands we Spalding
Bet a couple M's and I'm all in
And I'm so high, in ten days I still be fallin'

[Chorus: Young Thug]
And I know you believe in me
And I'm at the top, you shall achieve with me
And I'm not gonna stop so you'll succeed with me
I have your body frozen, your degrees with me
And I know you believe in me
And I know, you know, I know you'll succeed with me
And I know, you know, I know you'll achieve with me
I have your body frozen, nigga freeze with me

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Yeah, and I'm the motherfuckin' realest
And any nigga hear about me they say Young the fuckin' illest
And y'all motherfuckers brainless, no ceilings
Bought the new Bentley coupe, the roof I had to fuckin' kill it
Bought my bitch the new Audi, we need to switch 'cause I like it
When I don't like to drive, we bought the jet so I can fly it
They say I'm sexy but the face look kinda mean so don't fright it
And niggas know I'm shootin', they say I don't, then they lyin'
And if they say they shot back they a front
The only niggas shot that was the runts
So shoutout to the runts
I'm the realest, no front
I'm sorry I had to kick it like a punt, yeah

[Chorus: Young Thug]
And I know you believe in me
And I'm at the top, you will succeed with me
And I'm not gonna stop so you'll succeed with me
I have your body frozen, your degrees with me
And I know you believe in me
And I know, you know, I know you'll succeed with me
And I know, you know, I know you'll achieve with me
I have your body frozen, nigga freeze with me

[Chorus: Young Thug & Joc Lowe]
I'm ballin', we ballin', she ballin', and we ballin'
And they foulin', and they callin', and we stylin' cause we ballin'
We ballin', we ballin', we ballin', we ballin', we ballin'
We ballin', we ballin' , we ballin' , we ballin'

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Uh-um, I'm not a rapper
But you might catch us flyin' out to Vegas, to cop a couple acres
But we ain't coppin' no waiter cause shit I'm the waiter
Why? Cause she make me wait for her
Now I adore her and I love it
I tried (?) at the top but cash you're still above it
And if you think you can fold this cash, you may pack up and leave
And I'm through talkin', so I'mma let the song bleed
Like yeah, like yeah, like yeah
And that felt like I was on the throne
And I took me a shot of Patron
And I called that ho phone and told her get back come
But if she don't

[Chorus: Young Thug & Joc Lowe]
I'm ballin', we ballin', she ballin', and we ballin'
And they foulin', and they callin', and we stylin' cause we ballin'
We ballin', we ballin', we ballin', we ballin', we ballin' (Verse 2)
We ballin', we ballin' , we ballin' , we ballin' (Let's go)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
She say she fuckin' with me
So you know I'm fuckin' with her back
Like the tag on her shirt but that's crazy
But I don't like the tags on my shirt, yeah
And I be playin' around with her like a kidder
But I ain't need to kid her, but I fuck with the rock crew
And I'm pro so I had to pro kid her, yeah
Now all the boys dig her
And she like, Thug are you kid
And I was like nah, this a mink, not a kid
Ain't draw on your car, that's a ribbon
And yeah, I be really freestylin', this wasn't written

[Chorus: Young Thug & Joc Lowe]
I'm ballin', we ballin', she ballin', and we ballin'
And they foulin', and they callin', and we stylin' cause we ballin'
We ballin', we ballin', we ballin', we ballin', we ballin'
We ballin', we ballin' , we ballin' , we ballin'

[Verse 3: Joc Lowe]
I'm rollin' up them ball bats
2 grams and a Giant, what you call that?
This shit taste like some fresh fruit
Lean back and blow it out the roof
Vanilla seats in the coupe
Windows tinted and it's bulletproof
Call them bitches and they comin' through
Don't miss your blessin' baby, achu
YSL on my shoes
My bitch name Jimmy Choo
Man I swear my religion true
I'm (?) tested like I got the flu
Any bitches say that I'm the truth
Me and Thug with them foreigns, back to back with the pistols drew

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
Uh, they, fuck
Uh, yeah
They ask me if I'm Tyler, the nasty
Nigga that used to be in seventh grade watching Degrassi
But yall niggas and your whips with your rims and your hat with the brims rolling right past me
But I could give a fuck less about what you doing
Who you screwing, who you booing
I got these bitches brewing in my gold pots
You could see the Rolex, the gold watch
See them gold (?) but you won't stop
I'm in that bape shit, or that bathing ape shit
That shit that make you my Superman hoodie is cape shit
You on that fake shit, that true religion, abercrombie, 'postale, nigga my t-shirt is pastel
My nigga I pass well
Well passed, and I pass that fucking class well
And when your bitch see me, she be like "Oh my gosh, your so (?), man you're so swell"
Like I'm so swole, this bape shit is so old, older than the ice cream shoes I have that's growing mold
And they say "Ace, you're genius" I say "I play piano, make songs, a big penis"
Cause when I have 2, listen to Neptune shit, I'm never Mars or Venus, you seen this
My 3D glasses still the cleanest, enis, anus, nigga you could paint this is a mutha fucking bush
All you niggas running but I'm still not in a rush and I'm winning
No races, but I'm grinning
Don't believe in God, but I'm sinning
He-man and she-man and he-man confused than
Yall want the rims, but I'm still chilling in the mutha fucking mini-van like
What it do, what it do, fuck you, and your crew, OF to the death, nah
Yall know I do bail, yall rep yall set until the death nigga this OF until, until
And nigga thats real, and nigga I'm raw, I'm bigger than my boss the cold 86 degrees heat on need with your bitch screaming out my name gagging on her knees
And nigga I'm reed, eating mutha fucking ice cream reese's pieces
Nigga I'm the (?) I'm the shit, You could call me Ace, The Creator A.K.A. feces
I'm eating like a feces

[Interlude]
What the fuck is my problem!
I'm a let this one ride out tho
I'm a let the keys fuck with the drums
A.C.E, OFM, Bangin' on your FM, yes
It was all a dream, now I got my own magazine, word up
I'm out, peace

[Verse 1]
Chef Sweaty braising your faculty (Yuh)
Face getting gray from the ash, but I'm laughing (Yuh)
That's the trace in me, nigga
Fuck out my face while I'm thinking
Ain't step foot up in my momma place for a minute
My days numbered (Yeah)
I'm focused heavy on making the most of 'em
Feel like I'm the only one pressing to grow upwards
Still, "Fuck you and whoever you showed up with"
Tryna see an end and some steadier hands (Yup)
Who you calling your mans? (Huh)
Bet you thought he was solid
When he really just sand, washing away with the water
I'm a land mammal staying away from the altar
Shit changed in the August, in the wake of that August
Last autumn, the leaves fell, and I raked in the profit
Disobeying the doctor
The good guy prescribe, faith never caught 'em
Chasing these rabbits, whole face in the faucet (Yeah)

[Chorus]
And I don't know who house to call home lately
(I hope my phone break, let it ring)
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po'
When I run, don't chase me
And I don't know who house to call home lately
(I hope my phone break, let it ring)
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po'
When I run, don't chase me

[Verse 2]
Solid, so the funds don't phase me (Yup)
On tour, wildin' 'bout a truck-stop racist (Ugh)
Hard as finding me a— a common thread between us
Raised different—my mama, she bore and bred the leader
Get shit popping like the gun's off safety (Yup)
Saying easy and doing harder when you get caught up
Raised neck-and-neck with Nak, so I’m a fluent brawler
Rain-checking on your plot if ever bread should pop up
Out the toaster, I gotta focus, my family problems
Shrunk and widened with the bumps in my personal finance
It hurt 'cause I can’t keep a date or put personal time in
Or reverse to the times when my face didn’t surprise you
Before I did the shit that earned me my term on that island
Can’t put a smile on your face through your purse or your pocket
Shit in a pile, never change, I’m stupid for trying
Still just too busy wilding (Still, yeah)

[Chorus]
And I don't know who house to call home lately
(I hope my phone break, let it ring)
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po'
When I run, don't chase me
And I don't know who house to call home lately
(I hope my phone break, let it ring)
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po'
When I run, don't chase me

[Verse 1]
Hands are hanging lying in a box
Breaking after seeing little dogs
We'll close the windows tonight
It's too cold for you to go outside

[Chorus]
She's my chowder, and I love her so much
She's my chowder, and I love her so much
She's my chowder, and I love her so much
She's my chowder, and I love her

[Verse 2]
Sitting there just staring at the trees
Trolling for a little love that green
We'll lock the door behind tonight
And leave a light on for your eyes

[Chorus]
She's my chowder, and I love her so much
She's my chowder, and I love her so much
She's my chowder, and I love her so much
She's my chowder, and I love her

[Verse 1]
Damn, it's been a long time since we spoke
Couldn't hear you over that fan
Thinking between a few jokes
It's getting me through the day

[Chorus]
Normally I wouldn't say
Lately how you're feelin that way
Told me tell you what to do
She's making a fool of you
Making a fool of you
She's making a fool of you
Something that you gotta lose

[Verse 2]
Fuck, usually it rolls right off
Guess it's only my bad luck
Didn't want to be so soft
Doesn't matter anyways

[Chorus]
Normally I wouldn't say
Lately how you're feelin' that way
Told me tell you what to do
She's making a fool of you
Making a fool of you
She's making a fool of you
Something that you gotta lose

[Intro]
Just try to relax
(Okay)

[Verse 1]
I turn round, something's missing from my bed
Hanging frown, My baby left before I dressed

[Chorus]
She can't leave me here alone tonight

[Verse 2]
Sitting down, socks and sneakers on my feet
Hanging 'round, feeling far too ill to eat

[Chorus]
She can't leave me here alone tonight
She'll be gone, for long
She won't hold me tight

[Verse 1]
Hey, what's up, my name is Pete
How do you do?
Yeah, it's really nice to meet
And say to you

[Chorus]
Oh, just a week
Yeah, it's alright
Just around here
Seems pretty nice
Leave around noon
Back to L.A
Don't really know
Yeah, it's okay

[Verse 2]
Moon is up, it's getting late
It's time to go
I won't remember
What's your name
Guess I don't know

[Bridge]
But now
It's mellow when we're hanging tight
And everybody seems alright
Damn, if she ain't looking fine
So fine
All night
Oh no, no more, make it stop
One, two dahahahah ahahahah

She's been looking at me sideways
Even me and all my weekday
It's too bad that she'll never know
Cause I can't, can't afford to let it show

She can't believe it, but I don't love you anymore
I just don't feel it, even though the cash will keep me warm

You know cash is where it's at
Sorry girl I'll be right back
She feels every second that it takes
I need every dollar I can make

She can't believe it, but I don't love you anymore
I just don't feel it, even though the cash will keep me warm
She can't believe it, but I don't love you anymore
I just don't feel it, even though the cash will keep me warm

[Verse 1]
As I lay me down to sleep
I hear her speak to me
Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, ‘cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
‘Cause every road that leads to Heaven's right inside you
So I can say

[Chorus]
Hello, my only one, just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say
Hey hey one day, you'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

[Chorus]
Hello my only one, remember who you are
You got the world ‘cause you got love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day you'll understand

[Bridge]
So hear me out, hear me out
I won't go, I won't go
No goodbyes, no goodbyes
Just hello, just hello
And when you cry, I will cry
And when you smile, I will smile
And next time when I look in your eyes
We'll have wings and we'll fly

[Chorus]
Hello my only one, just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
And you're still my chosen one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori ab-
I just want you to do me a favor

Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me...

[Chorus: Ca$h Out]
No domestic violence I put my hands on you

And this money keep blowin', blowin', blowin'
And you just keep going
And this money keep blowin'

[Verse 1: Ca$h Out]
And I'm like round and round and round and round we go
All this money on this floor, girl you can go and touch your toes
A whole brick in ones look like I done signed with the pros
And the way your body move, I thought your momma was a pro
I know that they be watching all this cash that I be blowin'
And I know that they be smelling all this gas that I be blowin'
I walked up in this bitch left pocket cheesecake right pocket still sloppy
And them hoes they run to Ca$h Out and Young Thug, they know we got it
Plus we say we got it
I pull up in that Maybach tell the Valet, hey he got it
Plus the shooter with me, no Master P but yeah he 'bout it
I brought out all my jewelry, now she heard of me
These niggas broke, need surgery

[Chorus 2: Young Thug]
As long as we fuckin' I'ma spend my cash on you
You slidin' down the pole, look at that ass on you
And I'm on that young nigga shit, I'm tryna smash on you
On your worst day you a nine like Steve Nash on you

So you just keep goin' goin', goin', goin'

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I'll coax it outta you, I'll coax it outta you
I hope you feel better, why?
'Cause the jewelry had you sick, tired of callin' you
When my lifestyle is smoke stank blunts
And ride around with them choppers
And the cars full of niggas like Rastas
Stay on Molly's and them my partners
What the fuck you mean baby girl? Ca$h Out the man
And if you ever thinking about robbin', you'll need 1000 plans
But I love you and I trust you
And I never put no one above you, girl

Everywhere they mark, they go back to back
And if we in the club where them bitches at?

Got so many spots in my house, that bitch'll ask, hold up
Ho get one pair of trues and act like she married, hold up
Wait, when she wanna fuck my tats she be embarrassed
In the club vibin' all real diamonds call that the ?
So many tat's on my leg that bitch say it look like I got on army pants
Money done got a little longer

Drank all of syrup I'ma fight my dogs like Mike

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Me and Guap sittin' on top of the world
Bands got me on top of you girl
Make me wanna buy diamonds and pearls

[Verse 1:Lloyd]

See I'm pouring out my liquor for my niggas that ain't here
And any day-to-day shedding tattoo tears
But I'm cool cause Weezy F's with me
Young Money clique Murder Inc family
Raised in the A and I'm born uptown
Cross Martin Luther King
Callio gon' lay it down
Yeah nigga act up whussup
Tell my nigga Tad he better rough them
Your girl open wide like them doors on my trucks
And my niggas bustin' niggas like they don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
They got the God in the buildin' J.R
Park all of my car in the buildin' no superstar
Nigga I'm harder than the buildin'
The Carter the buildin'
Give quarters to pilgrims; Thanksgiving
I ain't giving no slack, bitch I'm black
And the President ain't never been that
Shit I'm ridin' with Lloyd
He lookin' for a freak-azoid
I'm like 'Hey, hook a nigga up with Ashanti'
I make her cook a chicken up and all my guns she hold 'em she blow my dice 'fore I roll 'em
Daddy need some new shoes, the Caddy need some new shoes
I'm thinkin' bout them 2-2's them 26's too cool I do those
I'm too cold shit I spit frostbite
Nigga I'm too raw I spit off-white
I get off white at 8AM I get off it by 8PM it's been a hard night
It's a hard knock life my lil nigga J still double-up twice
My lil nigga Marl still livin' on the block
With a nigga that he beefin' with but he still eatin' shit pleasantly
It's whatever B, we ain't on no scary shit
You goin' down I'm obliged on some Mary shit
I get bread like the Dairy bitch
I chop you up like the Deli bitch
I'm at the supermarket
I'm on isle 17 that's Hollygrove
Apple & Eagle street tell 'em holla, hoe
I put the sizzurp down then I swallow mo'
I take a hit of the dutch...

[Intro]
Come on
Yeah
Punch, what's happening brother?
Niggas be poppin' that shit at me like it's something new to me or something, know what I'm talking about
I tell a nigga quick, that shit just a rerun to me, nigga
I've been doing this shit since Vanguard, brother
And tell me what's happening with it
Niggas hate on me but hop right on my dick as soon as they see me
Soon as they see me, they be like

[Verse 1]
What up doc
That's what they tell me every second around the clock
Everytime I clock in, rappers checkin' they watch
Studio paid for, hours unlimited
Assholes, how many MC's I knock off they payroll?
How many God MC's I knock off they halo?
Hip-Hop ain’t dead, consumers changed up
Rappers love to see gold like the end of a rainbow
I stay low, like my socks under my ankles
Play the back like a turtle shell, know well
That my team got me if I ever slack on my shit, so if I fall?
Guess what, I don't even trip
It's like that, crushin' little battle raps
Punchlines, I did that in '99, you think it's a gold mine when you think of one
You think you hot, but I think you done
Like Queens, New York slang, look what the killer brung
Machine guns to a fight, fucking right
Pay the bill or I'm turning out your lights, good night
I shatter niggas' dreams, thinkin' they the West Coast kings
Till I drop like visine, tell a nigga quick, it ain't always what it seems
Like the stitching on swap meet jeans
I'm itching to scratch a whack rapper, gun clapper, snuff him like a rude capper
Got a cool bladder, but I'm pissed off, at ya

[Hook]
The real is back
Fuck the artificial, won't you let the realers rap
They scribble in they notebooks, me? I state facts
Safe estate, they know where the best be at
Whenever I ask, "Are you not entertained?"
Body any nigga that wanna holla my name
And what, no cut, this is Top Dawg gang
What the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up

[Verse 2]
Nigga said he'd snatch my chain in the streets
What chain? I barely wear jewelry
So I ever had one, you barely seen it on me
And if I ever had a gun, you wouldn't know it was on me
So snatch it and then you're done
I'm in a studio, just sipping on Parmesan
Thinkin' about who could fuck with Kenny and Paula's son
I live this shit, try stop me, you won't live to shit properly
Catch four between your abdomen
Next time you see me, don't ask me who I'm collabin' with
Between me and you, some of the new West is actresses
New hate activists, lowkey can't stand our shit
But still we continue to drink laxatives
Cold blooded, make the label hand me your budget
This is mine don't touch (pow pow), did I stutter?
Catch two, cats knew, I been a gorilla, welcome to the zoo
Yup, you little monkeys know what it do, come test me

[Hook]
The real is back
Fuck the artificial, won't you let the realers rap
They scribble in they notebooks, me? I state facts
Safe estate, they know where the best be at
Whenever I ask, "Are you not entertained?"
Body, any nigga that wanna holla my name
And what, no cuts, this is Top Dawg gang
What the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up

[Verse 3]
Dayum, you killin' 'em K-Dizzle
And if you don't kill 'em, then you send 'em to hospitals
Sleepin' on a recliner bed, with a thin pillow
I'm with a white bitch, ass like a black widow
Bet I dribble to the end of my lifeline
So when I die, you can say I balled for a long time
The 0-8 Frankenstein, beast like Sasquatch
Feet size thirty-six, steppin' on Hip-Hop 'cause that's my bitch
I write a rhyme, then she ride my dick
The girl is mine, I don't know the ho that you with
You niggas know this, I'm way better than I've ever been
So focused, like a sniper when he zoom in
What's your motive?
I bet it's to go against, like the GT
Get your bitch ass bit, all on these streets
I'm the almighty K, Compton
Rep it 'til my very death day, let the reaper in his face
And recite every song from NWA
I pay homage for those great who paved the way
Wait, back to the subject of who's, and who doesn't do what I do
Bluffin' until I touch 'em like a masseuse do
Nothing compares to me, but the throne, so tell 'em bring the chair to me
I'm a rare bully, small nigga but I handle y'all niggas like I'm eight feet tall
Nigga

[Verse 1]
What makes you want to live again
Goodbye my enemies, hello my friends
And what would make you forgive the man
Who was once your enemy but now your friend

The sunshine is waiting for me on the other side of the rainbow
The point of no return, my life's changing

For the better
The better (x4)

[Chorus]
Cause now I know better
So, thanks to my past
Oh, baby now it's all better
Let's make this shit last
Oh, yes, cause now I know better
So, thanks to my past
Oh, yes, I know there nothing better than now 

[?]

[Verse 2]
Hello pretenders, hello my friends
Hello to those who didn't want us to win
Hello backstabber and your cheap grin
There's more just like you that's listening

The sunshine is waiting for me on the other side of the rainbow
The point of no return, my life's changing

For the better
The better (x4)

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 1]
Think I been fuckin' you for way too long, let's call it quits, oh baby
We been doin' this shit too long, I think that shit's so crazy
20, 30 minutes in this bathroom stall
Face is in this mirror, your legs is at the wall
At the wall, drunk up off this alcohol
Be my Cinderella, shawty, leave your feelings at the ball
I mean after all, I'm just saying after all
When we get this faded who the fuck gon' take them panties off?

[Chorus]
It ain't no one but me
It ain't no one

[Verse 2]
And fuck them candles, let's do this shit gangsta
Do you in this room and show you I'm truly a gangsta
Pardon my manners, I usually thank ya
But you in here usin' a nigga and dammit you doin your thing, yeah
Get your back up off that pole and drop it
While I strip you like you dancin' on that pole for profit
We do it like an uncut version, girl
I'ma do you like an untouched virgin, girl

[Chorus]
It ain't no one but me
It ain't no one, but me, oh no
Only for me
Only for me
Ash
Blowing through her hair
Blowing out the window
Selfish but
Doesn't mean a thing
Bites you raw
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna close the door
Grass is growing up my legs
Breaking up the floor

Run from Angela

[Chorus]
Thugga and Guwop got 100 choppas
1017 we the, Mafia
We the motherfuckin' mafia nigga
No less than 20 in my trousers lil nigga

[Verse]
Got these bitches bending over like a lineman
Make the pot, bitch straight over like a linemen
Everybody get that green, we the live men
All my slime crickets, I think we need lemons
1017 the mothafucking movement
Pipe that bitch down, I'ma duel it
The way I  throw em through  it, my arm  a Uzi
Bought a bitch a pair of shoes, and fuck her booty
Hol'  it, don't let up, these niggas can't catch with thugga no thugger
We eatin' no other
I'm chubby like my brother
I'm chubby like my mother
We take all yo goodies, and go straight to Costco
Catch up with yo bitch, and turn her into a sucka
We not overseas but you know we Russian
Picnic early, clubbin later
I'm not no candy,  but I am a jawbreaker
You think I'm gay,  I'ma send ya to meet your maker
Put a hole in yo head like you's  a piston

[Chorus]
Thugga and Guwop got 100 choppas
1017 we the, Mafia
We the motherfuckin' mafia nigga
No less than 20 in my trousers lil nigga
Thugga and Guwop got 100 choppas
1017 we the, Mafia
We the motherfuckin' mafia nigga
No less than 20 in my trousers lil nigga

[Hook]
See we ain't worried 'bout damn thing, damn thing
You talking it but you not about a damn thing
So what 'chu doing about it? not a damn thing (damn thing)
Keep it moving , I'm overdoing my damn thing (damn thing)

You see I'm here now. that's right you not the man
They say I spit coke, supply the block with grams
And I ain't lift waiting, I'm taking lots of grands
Cuz I ain't got patience, I'm not a doctor fam
My niggas get it crunk, chump rep the side you from
Smokin' somethin nigga, light ya blunt
Ain't got 'cha gun you better find you one (why?)
Cuz this is Pistolvania. where them apes crawl
Bunch of shorties on the the corner, pocket full of  8 ball
And you never really see one of my niggas until they cake long
Aye what 'chu mean man? something like the Great Wall
As far as rap go, yeah its in the bag
Of course the haters wanna do me bad
Prolly mad because of the shit that I have
I never let them slow me down dawg I'm living fast
So as long as the chick want to get with the young
And it's all about making this cash
I'm still a young'n but niggas respect the flow
And don't check me, ya better check ya ho

[Hook]

I'm in the studio, making classic keep
You niggas mad at me, this cash I have to see
And you chumps can amount out for the ones
And I'm bout done with you punks
And you clowns wanting to come for the crown
I hear alot of talk, I gotta let them know
I put the bussiness on a nigga, really feeling nutty when he come
And try to touch the flow
Cause I'm not for the game, opt you will not do a thing
See I was taught you gotta walk & you talk if you sane
And its 4-1-2 till I fall to the grave
They'on know what to do with the ball to this game
Cause I'm always pimpin' if you hear my voice it attract the whole world gone listen
Some niggas might can hate, but you can say
I get away with murder like o j simpson
I'm into all day grinding, dont knock or come near
See im putting the time in. the young'n keep rhyming
So one day I can sit back & reclining
I see you stressed out, man we do this shit for fun
Call me the best out, khalifa get it done! (yes!)

[Intro: Bad Lucc]
I had seen a lot of niggas come up in this game
But never did they make the look so good
From candy cars to bright yellow bras
The gangster white walls and the wood
You see, there comes a time in a man's life
Where you gotta choose the goods of the game
Oh, but it so hard to turn your back on a place
Where everybody knows your name

[Verse: Snoop Dogg]
It's a cold game, I ain't been one to
Jump in and out of the range
Maybe an old school synagogue
Spinnin' the vision from which I faint
You got to do it, you can, gotta keep rhymin'
East Side High enjoyin' life, hair blowin' in the wind
The state that I'm in is gangster bliss
This is what you're callin' a sis
Passin' them off quick, memories missed
I made a lot of friends, a whole lot of money
Been down a couple times, but it never stopped my rhymin'
In fact, I got better, clutchin' on Beretta's
Blowin' a sticky, turn it to whether
A war shows in dough free lobos, this is how a player roll
And I never be questioned by some new young chump
Poppin' their toss, Snoopy D.O. made the way for you to walk
Owe it to the almighty, without you it couldn't be done
Your praise put the rise of the son, you dig?
Hold closer my hands from my throne
And I never be crucified within my own zone
Here is a very good reason to show love
But you gotta separate grown man from grown thug
From almost goin' down for murder in '93
To keys all over the city bowlin' in Snoops league
I changed, I got smarter, I got a daughter
Two sons, beautiful wife for starters
I did it all, Jack, poppin' this peas
Eatin' international cuisine overseas, yeah
Don't judge me, you only knew Snoopy
You never tried to know Calvin, you tried to groove me up
Like some loco, I earned my respect
Did so much shit for the Coast, I should get a check
But all in all, I did it big
Cool as a blind with a C
Leveled my life as I push away the groupies
Snoopin' in a coopin', you can call me Uncle Snoopy

[Bridge: LaToiya Williams]
(Don't worry about)
Don't worry about your circumstances
Take your chances, still from the L, B, C
For you are the C
Holla at ya uncle Snoopy
Holla at ya uncle Snoopy

[Hook: LaToiya Williams]
I paid my dues
And now it's time to make a change
Gotta make that move
There's a time and place for everythin'
I paid my dues
And now it's time to make a change
Gotta make that move
There's a time and place for everythin'
I paid my dues
And now it's time to make a change
Gotta make that move
There's a time and place for everythin'
I paid my dues
And now it's time to make a change
Gotta make that move
There's a time and place for everythin'

[Bridge/Outro: LaToiya Williams]
Don't worry about your circumstances
Take your chances, still from the L B C
For you are the C
Holla at ya uncle Snoopy
Holla at ya uncle Snoopy

One time for the real niggas
All I hang around is the real niggas
Cut throat, selling pure coke
Nigga fuck with me, murder she wrote
In a club, Frank Lucas with a minkcoat
All I need is work in a speedboat
Truck full from my amigo
Free my dogs, fuck Rico
Bitch I'm off the molly, my eyes low
Wet crew, at one time

Bricksquad, new Wu Tang
My flag red, suwoo bang

[?]

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 1]
Free is all that she could be, that's why she'll never stay
White, bare naked in the night and looking for some play
Just another girl that wants to rule the world at any time or place
And when she gets into your head you know she's there to stay

[Chorus]
You want it? Well she's got it
Molly's chambers' gonna change your mind
She's got your, your pistol
Molly's chambers' gonna change your mind
Molly's chambers' gonna change your mind

[Verse 2]
Slow, she's burning in your soul with whispers in your ear
It's okay I'll give it anyway, just get me out of here
You'll plead, you'll get down on your knees for just another taste
And when you think she let you in, that's when she fades away-ay

[Chorus]
You want it? Well she's got it
Molly's chambers' gonna change your mind
She's got your, your pistol
Molly's chambers' gonna change your mind
Molly's chambers' gonna change your mind

[Outro]
This chamber gonna change your mind
Hey Molly, where's your chambers?

Hey Molly, I wanna come in your chambers
If you let me, on a beach

Hey Molly, why don't you go to your chamber, and take me with you
Oh Molly won't ya go
Oh Molly
C'mon

[Kanye West]

Y'all might as well get the music ready because this finna' take a while
Umm, When I had my accident I found out at that moment nothing in life is promised except death,
If you had the opportunity to play this game of life
you need to arpeeeciate every moment
a lot of people don't appreciate their moment until it's passed

[Crowd applauds]

[Kanye West]
And then, you got to tell those Al Bundy stories "You remember when I ?"
But, Right now is my time and my moment thanks to the fans, thanks to the accident, thanks to god, thanks to Roc-A-Fella, Jay-Z, Dame Dash, G, my mother, Rhymefest everyone that's helped me
And I plan to celebrate, I plan to celebrate and scream and pop champagne every chance I get becasue i'm at the grammys baby!

[Crowd aplauds]

I know everybody's asking the question, they wanted know "I know he's going to wild out, I know he's going to do something crazy"
Everbody wanted to know what I would do if I didn't win.

[Moment of silence]

[Kanye West]
I guess we'll never know.

[Crowd cheers]

[Verse]
I know what it is to be broken and be bold
Tell you that my silver is gold
Though we're much too old for make believe
And I know what it's like to behold and not be held
Funny how a stomach unfed
Seems satisfied 'cause it's swell and swollen
And you caught me
Shootin' cross the sky like a star
But nobody told me
To never let it get too far
You see my silhouette, so you're standing scared of me
Can I tell you a secret?

[Hook]
My wings are made of plastic, my wings are made of plastic
My wings are made of plastic, my wings are made of plastic
My wings are made of plastic, my wings are made of plastic
My wings are made of plastic, my wings are made of plastic
My wings are made of plastic, my wings are made of plastic
My wings are made of plastic, my wings are made of plastic

[Outro]
My wings are made up
And so am I

[Verse 1]
If your body should ever leave your soul
Remember that in me you have an example
I lay my head upon a bed of stone
Tugging on the tide so I'm not on my own

[Hook]
Man on the moon
Man on the moon
Man on the moon
Man on the moon

[Verse 2]
I used to say I love to stay alone
Now the lights are never bright when I get home
A soul cannot be whole if only rogue
Can a vagrant body be celestial?

[Hook]
Man on the moon
Man on the moon
Man on the moon
Man on the moon
Man on the moon
Man on the moon
Man on the moon

[Hook:]
I just wanna tear something up, baby girl let me tear something up
I just wanna tear something up, call me when you wanna get tore up
I just wanna tear something up, baby let me tell you what
I just wanna tear something up, who wanna get tore up?
I just wanna tear something up, call me when you wanna get fucked
I just wanna tear something up, call me when you wanna get tore up
I just wanna tear something up, call me when you wanna get fucked
I just wanna tear something up, call me when you wanna get tore up

[Verse 1:]
I'm in the mood to fuck, not in the mood to talk
I'm not the dude to date, Pay all your bills you cray
Fuck what your girlfriend say, ball like the NBA
Check out my resume, let's buy a Benz today
Money the lam today, call all your friends today
She sleep in a bed with me but at first was scared of me
I tear that pussy up then give her something good
Never bite the hand that's keepin' her fed
Bring home a baby and I killed a bitch
Don't go in that room, it's too crowded
My girlfriend show you how to bust that bitch
Cut a ho off, I don't trust that bitch
Big Gucci baby on that juvie shit
Got them in my house and I have that shit
Don't need no friends, I can buy you some
While you getting your hair done I get you a salon
Why you getting yo nails done, I can buy you one
If you never took a pill then try one

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Stab pussy baby and I carry it
Let's fly to Vegas, get married quick
I'm a burglarer, I'm a murderer
Three tibs off baby, I'm wearing it
I'm kind of careless with that money, might drop a mill
Spend 50k on bags and heels
Smoke that Cali kush in the Hollywood hills
Ball so hard, you don't need no nigga
I mean a real bad bitch don't need no nigga
My trip with the homies don't feed no niggas
Big Guwop, he better choose that nigga
Better cut that man off, better lose that nigga
Since the last man was born
All these lames be pourin'
It's a miracle that we ain't sleepin'
Been on the road, playin' we tourin'
On the road main bitch a foreign
Yea and I'm a paint it orange
I'm fresh in this red Laren
Been ballin' since the day I was born
That lil nigga don't get along with me
Cause the niggas I got too squad with me
I'm on that lady cushin'
I feel asleep in that pussy

[Hook:]

[Intro: DMX]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, grrrrr
Grrrrrr, WHAT!
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1: DMX]
I love music cause it's somethin special
I just have the words and when I'm done, I bet you
It'll make you easier to cope with the pressure
In dark, cause you think the light won't let ya
Right now all I see is shapes and sounds
You snake you clown that's why I shake you down
Got somethin I want, I'ma take it now
It is what it is, you cryin like "How I'ma make it now?"
Get the FUCK off your knees, I don't swing like that!
Cause when I let it go I let it go, I throw that thing right back
Man, I can smell pussy from a mile away
Nigga yo' style is shade so, put the smile away
Niggas actin like I'm the only one with problems
You know somethin I don't? Fuck it, let's solve 'em
And at my worst you not even HALF of me
Which is one reason why you'll always be AFTER me
FAGGOT!

[Interlude: Kashmir]
Oh my God!
No matter how hard I try I just can't get away from it
I got so much fire built up inside of me
But when it's time to let it go
I got one thing to give and one thing only
YO DOG!

[Verse 2: Kashmir]
Hot bars is the only thing these muh'fuckers gettin
It's time to show these niggas Dog ain't raised a fuckin kitten
Eat twenty niggas like a 20-piece bucket of chicken
Ain't on my level snowflake, who the fuck is you kiddin?
The hottest chick in the game is what I am still
Fire hot enough to burn your whole entire grill
And believe me, them third-degree burns are hard to heal
I'll have you wishin you liestened to Fire Marshal Bill
You can't take the fire that I'm bringin y'all
I'll have yo' ass beggin for a fire extinguisher
And all your mans, lookin at you like damn holmes
I'm hot enough to burn the flesh off your damn bones
So for you niggas be claimin that you got heat
And claimin that you're the best and the next to eat
I'll be next to X or next to Grease
With bars that'll hit you like a bottle of Texas Pete

[Verse 3: DMX]
WHAT!
Don't start what you can't deal with
'Cause I'm a nigga that still get all up baby, real shit
I'm a dog for real, I beast on niggas
Take it back to the streets on niggas, feast on niggas
Open a bottle of liquor, pop a can of beer
Pour out the first sip for the homies that ain't here
Because you know in your heart they still right there
It is what it is, at times life ain't fair
You ain't me so what I'm 'bout to do to this rap shit
Will have some real niggas on some "excuse my back" shit
Wish a nigga would, wish a nigga could
Regardless of what you think, a nigga's still good
So easy to, kill a nigga
Especially when you don't, feel a nigga
Can't see the, real in a nigga
We don't know about Gucci, we don't know about Prada
But what we do know is we gon' do what we gotta
NIGGA! WHAT!

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
You're so smart, you're like, a contemporary museum of art
That farts, that's harsh, narcissism, on narcotics
On sharp objects in large pockets
At dark, you ain't gotta hide it, keep it, "Metal Gear Solid"
Lead the leaders, that's how you file it, then clobber it
Low on energy, find peach cobbler then gobble it, yeah
It's food in them drums and boxes
If you beat 'em up then they'll drop it
And they'll rapidly flicker till they disappear
Blinking gradually quickens 'til they isn't here
And that's da da da da da da da da da da...
Just to be back in, reincarnated, exact twin
Exact ten, exact twelve
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba (Exact self)
Do I really gotta say it? Didn't we all play it?
Dojo, Abobo, over shoulder throw, polo
Billy, Jimmy, even on the low low

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco & Crystal Torres]
Why you ready to die? You just a baby
Why them tears up under your eyes? You just a baby
Keep your head up in the sky, you just a baby
Quit chasing money, never mind, you just a baby
These Magi adore you, Adoration of the Magi
These Magi adore you
Why you wanna be born again? You just a baby
Why you playing in the streets? You just a baby

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Now let's vogue (Vogue) mountain pose (Pose)
Downward facing dog (Pose) warrior pose (Pose)
Tree pose, bridge pose (Pose, pose)
Triangle pose, seated twist (Pose, pose)
Upward facing dog (Pose, pose) pigeon pose
In this bitch, that's vulgar, that's yoga
Let's try it again with clothes, and closer, enclosure, exposures
Quiet is kept like Rosicrucian meet Cosa Nostras on Oprah's sofa
With both controllers watchin' Gazans and Ashkenazis ride roller coasters
Say yeah, yeah, lots of options, now up is down, two player
Now A is jump and B is punch, you seein' somethin' that wasn't there
To find friendliness in a nemesis, it's a old test
Three buttons, see somethin', that's emphasis on Genesis, oh yeah

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco & Crystal Torres]
Why you ready to die? You just a baby
Why them tears up under your eyes? You just a baby
Keep your head up in the sky, you just a baby
Quit chasing money, never mind, you just a baby
These Magi adore you, Adoration of the Magi
These Magi adore you
Why you wanna be born again? You just a baby
Why you playing in the streets? You just a baby

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Can't be eyes closed when you side scroll
You not the first person
The first person from your first curse until your first cursive
And your curse words is in the curve version
It occurs virgin is the word version
That refers perfect to the first person
In the third verse, who's really me
In the third person but prefers the first one
That's me, again
Master cleanse in a syringe
From a gerber until your first burger
Pamper to her depends
Everything between is just drawers
Even in between is no loss
Even where the king is no boss
Meet it with a swing it's so south, yeah
Unless you Bamm Bamm
Knocking them pitches into the grand stands
In the club, watching the women just do them handstands
Like you a man's man
That's washing down a ham with the Zam Zam
Who got a baby in here with these strippers?
She's two weeks pregnant
Didn't even know, he's dancing with her, damn...

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco & Crystal Torres]
Why you ready to die? You just a baby
Why them tears up under your eyes? You just a baby
Keep your head up in the sky, you just a baby
Quit chasing money, never mind, you just a baby
These Magi adore you, Adoration of the Magi
These Magi adore you
Why you wanna be born again? You just a baby
Why you playing in the streets? You just a baby

[Interlude]
I'm about to get into this, girls
This is for all the grown women out there

[Bridge]
I hear the sound of that wrapper coming off, yeah
The wrapper getting off, going off for your love
Licking on the lollipop, yeah, the wrapper coming off
So much sugar in your touch
Hope you ready for this jelly, put the fire in my belly
Now we pop, rock, steady, steady
Really hot, show me all you got
Boy I can't get enough, I'm addicted to this love
Je ne sais quoi
Cherie, m'vle-ou
Aswe ya ce net al kole!

[Verse 3]
On the day you finish me, I kiss you and you lick your lips and so do I
Know you never waste a drip, so don't you wonder how it feels sometimes

[Pre-Hook (Pharrell)]
Keep me coming, keep me going, (keep me going)
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, (keep me moaning)
Won't stop loving 'til the morning, ('til the morning girl)
Blow, (ooh)

[Outro-Hook (Pharrell)]
Can you eat my skittles?
It's the sweetest in the middle
Can you eat my skittles?
Can you eat my skittles?
(Sweetest in the middle baby)
Skittles, skittles, skittles
Blow

[Verse 1]
I know where you went, but I don't know how you got there
I know where you went, but I don't know how you got there
Silver tongue hill, where you talk up what I'd play down
I would speak up, but I wouldn't know what to say
Oh, to say

[Chorus]
Lucidity, come back to me
Put all five senses back to where they're meant to be
Oh, it's hard to tell, breaks down
There is a will, there is a way

[Verse 2]
Wandering around like spare time never knew it
I might suck, fizzle or I might just float away
(Float away)

[Bridge]
And we'll go running off tonight
High above, where we won't even
Need to reach the sky, my love
Oh, there will be a change in the air
Nobody will be anybody else

[Chorus]
Lucidity, come back to me
Put all five senses back to where they're meant to be
Oh, where we'll go, tiptoe
Tread boldly right down to the lair

[Verse 1]
Early night jumping out the Porsche
Joyrich hoodie and sweats, smoking as good as it gets
Life of the party, know I get it started
I take a shot you take a shot, I roll a joint you roll a joint
Let's turn this spot into a after-party
Ain't heard about me you should ask somebody
We play the music off our iPhones
Gon' light that weed up, nobody home and plus were growing
Young nigga with gin in this red cup
Turning up cause we don't give a fuck and only ones that gets us is us
Toking 'till I'm glaze, rolling smoking blaze
Rock expensive J's, glad I brought my shades
Got a bottle somebody gave me, and another one I saved that I bought on the way

[Pre-Chorus]
Now that's faded, pour a shot cause' we made it
Two shots if you're feeling good, middle finger if you hate it
Got fly as I wanted to
Got high as I wanted to
Couldn't lie if I wanted to
Couldn't drive if I wanted to

[Chorus]
I got two shots another one poured
'Bout to roll a joint and it's going down
I got Bombay in the bottom of my cup
Faded but I got enough to go around
I got shoes on you can't find em in the store
Pound of weed you can smell it by the door
Palm trees you can have this all season
I'm balling and the niggas running with me
Is ready for whatever (x4)
Writer At WarKendrick Lamar in his own words.A lot of times in interviews, people ask me things like, “How does it feel now? What have you bought your mom and your pops and family?” Nobody ever really asks about what it’s like trying to adapt to fame and money and how much of a depression it can make for you. How much of a depression it could put you in knowing that so many kids hang on to your words. I can’t make a song like “i” without being in that dark place. “i” comes from going overseas, going to New York, being in L.A. and hearing kids saying, “Kendrick, I was gonna kill myself last week. Section.80, good kid, m.A.A.d city saved my life.” Or “I was gonna kill myself tonight until I came to your show.”

I believe that they are telling the truth. At first I wasn’t so sure, maybe it was just they were excited to meet me. But then they showed me their wrists and had all these different scars from when they tried to take their lives but failed. Or I look into their eyes and their pupils are dilated and they on all these types of meds and drugs, it’s a whole different story to me. That’s when I learned that while I’m making music for myself, drawing from my own experiences and conflictions and battles within myself, this teenager listens to every word I say. And that’s spooky

I think one of my biggest battles within myself is embracing leadership. You always grow up and you hate the term “role model.” You would say, “I don’t wanna be a role model. I don’t want none of that.” But in actuality, you are the biggest role model. It’s impossible to fight the title of role model. Especially when the type of music I make is so personal. People feel like they can relate to me or that they are me. They feel like they know my whole life story even though we from different worlds. So when I go out and meet them in public, I don’t get a response like, “Kendrick, will you sign this real quick?” Or, “I wanna just take this picture with you.” No, they want to have full conversations. I find out that they live their lives by my music and that right there is something

[Kendrick Lamar's XXL Cover Story - Second Clip]When I try to soak it all in, that’s the only thing that kind’ve scare me, feel me? Life is sad in general and I’m meeting these different people every day. It kind’ve snaps me back into reality outside of what I do. Outside of the girls, outside of the cars, the money, it really ain’t that important when you meeting somebody that’s still in the struggle. These the people that live their lives in dark spaces, every day , you know, and they use my music as some sort of tool to keep going, almost like a Bible, you know? These kids feel like they got nothing to believe in but they see me and say, “Kendrick, I believe in you. I believe in your music.” And what happens it puts me in some type of space where it’s almost like some type of worship or responsibility, but I know it. I can see itAnything I say or do, I don’t take back, I don’t regret.I think one of my biggest assets is not knowing how famous I am. Or even excluding the word, I hate the word “famous.” I’m aware of it. I know people treat me different because of it. And the more I am aware of that and play into it, the more I become detached from the real world. So it’s really about balance. The more somebody opens the door for me and I walk through without acknowledging that they opened the door for me, the more I become separate from others

I had a talk with Lauryn Hill and she said, “Try to completely throw away your ego.” How many times can you throw away an ego, you know? It’s tough. It’s something we all battle with. I battle with it all the time and the idea of being in all these places—the big spots, all the events, the lights—it’s all for your ego. It’s all for your own confirmation to be like, okay, I’m somebody. But truthfully, you’ve always been somebody. You don’t need the lights




I try to think about that. Also, I like to look at old pictures and think of things from back in the day that kind of draws me back to where I came from. I think a lot of times when artists are in so much of the now, they only think of what’s ahead of them, which is cool. But I look at pictures of the small little apartment that I come from in Compton and things like that. And it always trips me out when I get too far out there where I’m missing phone calls or not responding to text messages on time or my peoples is hitting me, my moms is and I can’t get back to her. Sometimes you on the go and you forget about those little things

It’s definitely a gift and a curse when you make music as personal as I make it. Of course you get the kids out there that say that they relate to you and this song saved their lives, and you helped them with their assignment for this and that. And then at the same time, your privacy is not respected. And all entertainers go through it, but moreso the ones that make very personal music, because it’s not just me you’re focusing on now when I’m out in public, but also on individual characters that I’m talking about in my music. So that’s a whole other ballgame and it’s just something that I’ve gotta acceptWhen I’m completely drained of inspiration, that’s when I’m finished with the project.I think the way it is, the positive aspect of me gaining more listeners and giving them some type of motivation and relatable effect, it’s more than running from somebody snapping a picture of my mom’s van that was on my album cover, that she actually still has. I’d never think that would happen, but it’s happened plenty of times to where she has to hide the van now. She can’t drive that thing no more. And she’s old school, she wanna drive it. But I never want them to be in this type of world, because not everybody can handle it. I think the average person wouldn’t be able to handle the day-to-day. It’s a lot of things you gotta deal with. So me doing that, it’s just a piece of me. I gotta find balance and try not to really get too frustrated over it

I’d be lying to you to say I knew good kid, m.A.A.d city would be as successful as it has been. In the beginning I was very doubtful. Once I was done, the jitters hit me so fast. I was so confident in making it, because I was like, “This is it, man. Nobody heard this story and if you heard it, you heard it in bits and pieces but I’m finna put it to you in a whole album—from Compton, from the hood, from the streets—it’s a whole other perspective and light, I’ma go back and do the skits just like how Biggie and Dre and Snoop and ’Pac did it. And I’ma tell my story.” Then I wrapped up with it and said, “Man, what’s on the radio right now? I don’t think they doin’ skits and things like that.” I don’t know if the people are gonna understand what I’m talkin’ about on this album because it’s almost like a puzzle pieced together, and albums ain’t been created like this in a long time. Albums that actually still reach the masses, at least




My whole outlook on being signed was to have an actual massive commercial successful album. This is what you think as a kid. You don’t know nothing about creative process and things like that. So I didn’t know how blessed I was to actually go and make an album that I can create and control 100 percent. When I was done with it, I was like, “Man, these people believe in me like this? They let me just do this whole thing by myself like this? I don’t know. Y’all sure I’m right?”
I was nervous because I didn’t think the people would understand it. And I get a call from Pharrell. He said he had a copy of the album and it’s amazing. And I was like, that call was right on time because that was when I was feeling super insecure about it. Pharrell said, “Never feel that way again. When that little negative man come behind your head, always follow your first heart, and that was your first heart, to put the album out like this.” This is his words verbatim, he said, “Watch what’s gonna happen.”I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten.When I come up to certain artists, artists that I’ve always looked up to, and they can recite my records that wasn’t the single, that puts me in a space where, okay, this is a person I always respect and to get their respect back was almost like confirmation for me. I always thought confirmation would be having a lot of money, and things I could do for my family

Because that was what we was taught when you come from these urban neighborhoods, you was taught that having money was success and that’s all you see, all you know. So once I got the money and everything else that comes with it, I felt like I wasn’t satisfied. I’m looking around like, this is great security, but I don’t even spend it on myself, I spend it on my loved ones. That makes me feel good knowing I can support somebody that’s in need. But at the same time, I’m feeling like, okay, what’s after this? So what I realized was, my greatest fulfillment of accomplishment was having somebody that I looked up to for so many years and knowing that I put in that same dedication and work and them saying, “Thank you.” And them being able to recite them lyricsKendrick Lamar - Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe (

[Explicit)]I think the first time I played “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe” for Andre 3000 was before it came out. I never share my album while I’m creating. I think that the situation with Andre was one of those things where he was in the studio with Dre and Dre was like, “Play some stuff .” I can’t say no to Dr. Dre. But me creating music, I never really play music for anybody, even people inside the camp because it can almost sway your creative process 100 percent. So along with that, I cut off everything on the radio; I really just duck off from music. Because I’m gonna be influenced and I don’t want to be. That has always been my process. I just feel like, it’s really the only prized possession that I actually can control, you know? It’s selfishness for sure, but it’s my selfishness and I own it

I know a lot of people that go around and play music to get approval because some are not so confident in the things they do. But with me, personally, I can only speak for myself, this is me. Anything I say or do, I don’t take back, I don’t regret. That’s how I was feeling at the time and that’s how y’all gonna get it, and I own it. Love me or hate me, I own it. It is what it is. And that’s how I look at itFrom 13 years old to the time I was 21, I was in a mode of mastering how to be a rapper. Like a rapper’s rapper, using my tongue as a sword, a fuckin’ barbarian. That’s all it was about, slaying words. So when I turned 21, 22, somewhere around there, I got into a mode where it became more of a writer aspect for me rather than just being a rapper ’cause this is around the same time where cats weren’t putting out mixtapes anymore. They was putting out full bodies of work and wasn’t even signed to a major label. So by that time, that’s when I started developing and actually constructing my music from a writer’s point of view. good kid, m.A.A.d city was probably one of them albums that you could unfold out into a book and read it. And that’s how I treat everything. Everything is critical like that from here on out. It’s the art of writingSo you ask yourself in the midnight hour, ‘Who am I? Is this really what I’m supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What’s my responsibility?'This is more than just music for me. This is actually a piece of me. I’m obsessed with it. And that’s how I take it. When I make my music, it comes from a genuine space where I’m already spreading myself wide to the world. So during my process in creating it, that time is for me, personally. That’s for my heart, those are my memories that helped me up with these lyrics and get inspiration. That was my memories. Taking those inspirations and going into that booth, that’s something that I hold dear

When I’m completely drained of inspiration, that’s when I’m finished with the project. When I start maybe trying to tamper with things that I shouldn’t tamper with, I’ve already had done, that’s when I’m done and I know I’ve exhausted inspiration. That comes with not wanting to actually rush the process. I always want to put it down to the last idea, and once I’m drawn away from it, that’s when I say, okay, let’s take all these pieces—they might not even be songs—let’s take these pieces and construct it. So what I want to say, and how I want to execute it becomes clear




It’s the best part because the things that I say on my records—this is another reason why I don’t just play records for people—you won’t necessarily get it until it’s constructed. I know what type of artist I am. I’m not an artist that’s gonna give you a single and say, “This is what my album’s gonna sound like, go sell it.” That’s not me. I’m just not that artist to give you one or two songs here and there and run with it. Everybody has their own niche. With mine, I just own it, and I know that’s exactly what that is. And I wanna keep that lane. I don’t want to jump in somebody else’s lane and try to do their moves because it may not work for me like it worked for them. So I stay where I feel like I’m inspired

What’s crazy to me is that I feel the same energy now that I felt before my first album. I know there’s lot of pressure for me on this new album but it don’t necessarily scare me. It’s almost confirmation, like, go in there and challenge yourself just the same way you challenged yourself the first time. Because I remember going to radio stations and them telling me this: “Dr. Dre had Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Eminem, you seen what Eminem did, right? Yeah, uh huh. Kendrick Lamar, he from the West Coast, and Compton, too. Dre from Compton, you see the legacy he left. Yeah, so I hope that album is good. Matter fact, you got the weight on your shoulders right now.”

Thank you for that. Let me get in the studio now since you just put the battery in my back

[Kendrick Lamar Covers XXL Magazine's Winter 2014 Issue]I thought I was going to win Best Rap Album at the Grammys. I put a lot of work in on my album and the biggest thing for me is knowing that it was basically an underground album. It didn’t have big No. 1 records on it and there wasn’t really any commercial hits. It was great songs and I think the message behind it reached as many listeners and believers as a super mainstream album. So for me, when you’re saying, “rap,” that would be my definition of something that deserved an accolade. Yep

I found out a lot about myself in these past two years. It’s scary. I know more about myself now than any other point of my life. I believe in this theory that when you get success and you get fame and money, it makes you be you times ten. I was a pretty shy and to myself type of person as a kid. And now 15 years later I’m in front of people every day, tens of thousands of people. So that makes me more of a recluse. That makes me not come outside of my world on the outskirts of L.A. and bounce around different places and things like thatWhat I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place.So you ask yourself in the midnight hour, “Who am I? Is this really what I’m supposed to be doing? How did I get here? Why am I doing this? What’s my responsibility?” It’s a real trippy thing, you feel me? And I think it’s something that nobody can understand; only an artist can. Things change for you with success when you get money. I noticed when people started treating me a little bit different, the people that I cared about the most, my close friends and family. The artist don’t necessarily change, it’s usually the people around them. Their expectations of you can sometimes be out of control. You can do one thing that can trigger something mentally in them that makes them think that you don’t care about them or you don’t fuck with them no more when that’s not the case. You’re just more focused on what you have to do because it’s biggerThe moment I start seeing change in people around me, that’s when I know something is a little bit different. Then there’s tension in the air that I probably can’t necessarily deal with at the moment. ’Cause when the industry don’t understand me, and the business don’t understand me, these are the people I can run to. What happens when I can’t run to them?

Artists just get paranoid in any situation and circumstance. I’m always paranoid. I’m already a person who thinks a lot; sometimes I may overthink things or think too much. So when you’re put into a space where you feel like you can’t necessarily trust your close ones, that can do some whole other crazy thing to you psychologically. Seriously. All you got is you and God at the end of the day

The hard time for me was probably when I was on the road. It’s almost like you go on the road and you’re gone for two years. And this place you’ve known your whole life, these people you’ve known your whole life, everything is different when you come back. And you feel like, damn, your sanctuary is now on that tour bus. That dirty, stinky, smelly tour bus. And that’s one thing, among numerous other things, that have been hard sometimes. To the point where people are pulling for you left and right, where you feel like you don’t have control over your own life. Over your own well-being

What I do is for a greater purpose and we all need money and things like that to survive, but the energy around some of these spaces, it can draw you into a crazy place. And I’ve seen and heard some of the greats go out because of it. And I’m saying this right now to let everyone know, it’s real and you have to be mentally steady 100 percent in order to keep doing it at a high level and still maintain your sanity
None of my lyrics are extraneous
Rhymes are spontaneous
I am the Fresh Prince and I am as brainy as
GALILEO
Wiser than Einstein
With the strength parallel to that of a land mine
I change to my surroundings, like
A CHA-ME-LE-ON
Sometimes I’m serious
And sometimes I’m silly
And in time you’ll see, my energy can’t be withheld
If it’s a sin to be a winner, then I’m going to hell
Setting the course for the tippy-tippy-top
And my goal is to be the undisputed king of hip-hop
Not trying to say that I’m the best, I swear it
But as the saying goes, if the shoe fits, then wear it
It’s not that I’m better than the rest, well, you see
It’s just that nobody is as good as me
SO I’M HUMBLE
When I’m complimented each day
I’m like, well, you know, what can I say?
My lyrics are praised, just like the scripture
The grammar is correct and they’re as vivid as a picture
I’m not the Messiah, the truth I must tell
I can’t walk on water, but I can swim like hell
I was taught by the world’s greatest MC
A man who undisputedly rules the whole rap industry
I was taught to be all that I can be
I was taught by a hell of a guy
ME
So don’t try to stop me, because I can’t be stopped
Don’t knock what I’m doing because I can’t be knocked
This is the night network, Friday night, you know
Westwood and me, the N-Sign Rap Show

[Verse 1]
I was watching my TV one night
When they broke in with a special report
About some devastating earthquake in Peru
There were 30,000 crushed to death
Even more were buried alive
On the Richter scale it measured 8.2
And I said "God, please answer me one question
Why'd they have to interrupt The Simpsons just for this?"
What a drag, 'cause I was taping it and everything
And now, I'll have to wait for the rerun
To see the part of the show I missed

[Chorus]
Why does this always happen?
Why does this always happen to me?
Why does this always happen?
Why does this always happen to me?
Ba-ba-ba-ba (Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba)
Ba-ba-ba-ba (Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba)

[Verse 2]
I was driving down the highway
When all the traffic slowed to a crawl
There was a twelve-car pile-up: Everybody dead
And I saw brains and guts and vital organs splattered everywhere
As well as my friend Robert's disembodied head
And I thought "Oh, poor Rob. I just had lunch with him
Hey, wait a minute, he still owes me money, what a jerk!"
Well there's five bucks that I'm never gonna see again
Plus now on top of everything else
It looks like I'm gonna be late to work

[Chorus]
Why does this always happen?
Why does this always happen to me?
Why does this always happen?
Why does this always happen to me?
Ba-ba-ba-ba (Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba)
Ba-ba-ba-ba (Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba)

[Piano Solo]

[Verse 3]
Oh the other day my boss said we were running low on toner
And he told me I should buy another case
Well I told him I was busy
But he still just kept on asking
So I turned around and stabbed him in the face
Oh and wouldn't you know it, my knife got stuck
I guess that's probably bound to happen now and then
But I'm afraid I may have bent the tip a little
And I know that blade will never ever be quite as sharp again

[Chorus]
Why does this always happen?
Why does this always happen to me?
Why does this always happen?
Why does this always happen to me?
Ba-ba-ba-ba (Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba)
Ba-ba-ba-ba (Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba)
Hey! Look up baby, they write my name in the sky bitch
Don't forget the baby is what I tell the pilot
Don't forget the liquor store is what I tell the driver

Some chocolate pudding down your pants
And then attach electrodes
To your brain and watch you dance
Oh, golly wouldn't that be fun?

Oh, and then I might decide
To tie you up with dental floss
I'll make you wear a harness
And I'll show you who's the boss
Of course, if you refuse
Well honey, it's your loss
I mean, I don't do this with just anyone

So baby, how can you say it's all over?
So how can you tell me goodbye?
So now you tell me that you're leaving me for good
And all I wanna know is why?
I mean, after all...

[Chorus 2]
I'm really such a groovy guy
Yeah, I'm such a groovy guy
I'm such a groovy guy
Yeah, I'm such a groovy guy
I mean you could do worse!

[Outro X2]
I'm such a groovy guy
Yeah, I'm such a groovy guy
I'm such a groovy guy
I'm such a groovy guy

[Intro]
Yeah, uh, opportunity be knockin', let a motherfucker in

[Hook]
Opportunity be knockin', you gotta let a motherfucker in
I kiss my mother on the cheek, tell her that I love her
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing, I got it covered
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Ma, you know I'm still your little baby

[Verse 1]
All my life I was a fuck-up, now I pull the truck up
Same bitch stuck up, now she wanna suck us
See me hangin' out the window, screamin', "What, what?!"
No more tough luck, a different cloth is what I'm cut from
Baby, oh, my lord
The cops chasin' Bronson in an all-white Ford
Shit, I'm on that all-night tour
Bitch, I'm alright, but I'm off that raw
I'm in a robe dancin' salsa on the top floor
You would swear I'm Puerto Rican, but I'm not, lord
Hot hoes every city that we go, singin'
"Heads high, kill 'em with it now!"
Uh, all I do is eat oysters
And speak six languages in three voices
It's Adriatic Summers on a sail boat
Don't even try to call, I'm not available for nothin'
Unless it's stupid paper, hop out the Studebaker
With Anita Baker, uh

[Hook]
Opportunity be knockin', you gotta let a motherfucker in
I kiss my mother on the cheek, tell her that I love her
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing, I got it covered
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Ma, you know I'm still your little baby

[Verse 2]
Uh, I feel so alive, I think I shit myself
I should kiss myself
I'm starin' at the man inside the mirror
The reflection shows a wolf though (AOOOH!)
Goddamn, I'm still cute, ho (Yeah)
All my women play the flute
Saw me plate some melon and prosciutt'
Left handed, make the Fender cry
Count money with a reverend's smile, the Devil's eye
Half-Cherokee and Gemini, uh
Motherfuckers'll dump heat, from Jump Street
And turn your chest plate to lunch meat
I'm in a Humvee, lookin' like a young me
Now these motherfuckers all wanna be chubby
I switch the season, now the hair's curled
Tan skin, I need a bad girl
Cause James Brown said, "It's A Man's World"
In a Transam' Twirl, the burner handle made of pearl
That's just "Daddy's Little Girl"

[Hook]
Opportunity be knockin', you gotta let a motherfucker in
I kiss my mother on the cheek, tell her that I love her
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing, I got it covered
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy?
Ma, you know I'm still your little baby

[Hook]
I'm expectin', like your girl when she's pregnant
What you expect?
I expect another check in
I'm expectin' to pass out these inspections
Ice, hoes, cars... I got it all, you guessed it
I'm expectin'
What you expectin'?
To ride past you, 'cause you're just a pedestrian
I'm expectin'
What you expectin'?
To ride past you, 'cause you're just a pedestrian

[/Chorus]

Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Yes sir

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
Check me out, look
26 inches, bitch I'm sittin' crooked
Old school Chevy, faster than a silver bullet
Strawberry paint, seats vanilla puddin'
2 bitches, gon' and eat each other's pussy
Top chopped sent the car to the barbershop
My driveway looks somethin' like a parkin' lot
I'm so unothodox
I got your bitch ridin' my dick wit no shocks
(Bounce bitch, bounce, bounce)
I'm the hottest shit jumpin' out the coffee pot
Man, I'm just tryin' to get my spot like a polka dot
Lil' kush make my eyes and my shoulders drop
Lil' syrup and I can make a soda pop
Keep talkin' 'n' I can make my soldiers pop
Real niggas wit me ridin' till the motor stop
I got these hoes straight livin' out the soap op
I got it covered like a coke top
Okay?

[Hook]
Always Strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me daps, bitches give me hugs
And since I'm paid, niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm
Always Strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me daps, bitches give me hugs
And since I'm paid, bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back
Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back

[Spoken: Lil Wayne]
See they gon' respect me
Believe that
Get 'em
Lil Weezy

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
Hollygrove, Jalapeña
Take a bite give ya ass a high fever
Them niggas jokin' I'm laughin' like a hyena
Real talk I had a Bird before I had a Beamer
Real talk I had the Beamer before I had the Benz
Swear to God I had the Benz before I had the Bentley
I ain't lyin' I had the Bentley before I got the Rolls Royce
Control it by voice I'm done with it
Chauffeur in the driver seat doesn't come with it
I gotta pay dude every day dude
Them niggas soft them niggas just beginner food
They ain't fuckin' with my interlude
Ha ha yeah, I get women in the mood
In the mood to get in the nude
And when we in the nude
Don't intrude she's falling apart
She wanna get screwed (C.M.B. nigga)
You can have a family feud
You jump in that water you will get brewed. Boy

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
Santana, ya dig (Ay!)
Let me talk to em. Let me get em
I make big money, I drive big cars
I smoke big blunts I don't need to hit y'alls
I'm higher then the stars, I'm higher then the sky
I'm sittin' on Mars, I'm higher then high
I'm flier then fly, chrome hard chain
From the wallet to the belt loop rock n roll fly
I dig the ladies the ladies dig I
So I dig they back out and make the chicks cry
(gotta) send em to they ma (gotta) send em to they pa
(gotta) send em to they guy (what)
There's something on they mind
There's money on my mind like Weezy Baby said
I ain't talking for this money
I'm speakin' to your head (Bang) ya dead
The two cock and pop yeah like boom shockalocka
Me I'm at the pool smooth colada, I'm sippin' on it
A long straw in my lap got the pistol on it
You see it I ain't sittin' on it (Nope!)
And my pockets full of cash money
Dipset bitch Cash Money fuck of the last supper

[Chorus]
Don't take a trip
Don't let me down
I know
I'm hollow

Keep my pinwheel
Spinnin' 'round

Swallow this-
You made a big
Mistake
Go away

Don't talk too much
You'll hurt yourself
I know
I'm hollow

Flush the fish
It can't be helped
I know him
I know how much
He wants
To stay

Don't take a trip
Don't let me down
I know
I'm hollow
My boy
Dry eyed
Don't take
My side
Open
Sideways
Spill mine
Spill mine

Blood the
Body
Fortune
In me
Blood the
Body
Spill mine
Spill mine
Success for my buddies, success for my friends
Success is the only thing I understand
Head back home to the place I grew up
Give my medals to the ones that I love

I'll chase Harvey through the door in the wall
He says, "never catch me, never miss me at all"
Drool comes down from the corner of his mouth
I say, "I love you Harvey, you cut it out"

I love winning, baby, I want it all
I wanna prove that I got the balls
Harvey keeps on playing with his food
He doesn't understand what big boys do

He wakes up in the middle of the night
I run in and turn on the light
Run my hands through his short black hair
I love you, Harvey, I don't care

[Chorus: Charli XCX & Rita Ora]
We're staying all night
We never slow down
I think we better do it like we're doing it now

These days everybody want an Oscar
And they not my sons, and if they are
I swear to god Imma put them in foster care
You on TV take you off the air
Imma show my ass like I ought to be here
You know I will like the autonomy clear
Won't explain that line, need not to be clear

I'm feeling right now I could spar with a bat
Bare hands hands out I got nothing to share
Just lit up a blunt, blowing smoke in the air
Foggy windows because my friends are burning forest fires
You no like it? We say Forrest run but I think Forrest tired
Blowing stinky like that motor oil when I burn my tires
Got my foot up on the gas gas gas, plus a lighter

Gas plus a lighter
Gas plus a lighter
I just bought a pack of condoms y'all a pack of vaginas

And she fast with her ass like her past get behind her
Imma bag her Imma drag her where my *bing* like the timer

Hold up, hold up, wait
If you hater then you a mistake
No Genre The Label, my life is great
Chilling with rebels man shout out to Jake

[Jake Lambo]
Shout out to me?
So it's my turn
Fuck these niggas talking bout, hold up
You ain't talking money, then shut up
Working from the night til the sun up
Higher than my life, bail whaddup
Higher like I got the job show up
Tell the boss to suck it, Imma blow up
Snitches get stitches, get sewn up
Pass Joe a bottle, the doors go up

[B.o.B]
Eat two hoes like I'm an omnivore
Or some type of carnivore, Tyrannosaur
Sorta kinda like a connoisseur
With an Excalibur kind of sword
Bitch, all the competition we started
And we top shelf, y'all niggas Top Ramen
Look bitch, Bobby go apeshit
Came from the wild we was raised in a jungle gym
Bitch, y'all sneak like rumpelstiltskin and pajamas
Rolling presidential yeah we rolling down Obama

She's a good girl, but tonight she a stripper
She got a man, but that nigga ain't with her
I give her a bottle like I was her babysitter

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm up in the section, we got bottle service

Yeah, my Audemars says it's time to pop bottles and get in the pool

[Hook]
I say I, I say I'm counting paper 'til the day I rest
They say I'm spoiled, but I can't tell, 'cus everyday I stay fresh
I'm ripping open all the new bags
Keep popping off all these new tags
All up on my 3 piece two swag
Bitch gimme head like Doo Rags
With the new jag, with the roof back
This weed good, but my coupe bad
Shout out to all my old hoes, I'm rich now, bitch too bad
Should of loved me when I had hub-caps, now it's 21 inch Asanti rims
6 figure nigga, on the first check, before I signed the deal
Now I gotta grind, until I'm out of time
Put my name all on that dotted line
Another deal, get another grill
I shine all this, lil' out of mind
But I'll snatch your link like Deebo
Get yo ass jacked like Steve-O
Get high but I creep low
I'm number one on point, like D Rose
I'm in love with my fourth ho!

[Verse]
How could anybody go against me?

I’m on e’erything, bitch I’m higher than a drone
And your bitch is gettin’ tapped like there’s wires on her phone
I put my settings on mute, you can still hear her screamin’
Had a orgy when I came it was a riot for my semen
I’m a boss, I could never be nothin’ lesser
Gimme brain, gimme brain, call me Nutty Professor
Do your homework or find that ass in detention
I call it domework, now that’s a head intervention
Bitch keep your head down, I keep my head in the stars
Make me the coach of San Diego, head nigga in charge
I’m screamin’ “head’s up!” while they catchin’ these fly balls
Fuck the world, Luda Bond, I nut and the sky falls

[Intro]
Album coming soon, expect the unexpected

[Verse 1: P.O.I]
Remember back in the days we used to smoke puffs
Ice or alligators, shurkled smuffs
Louis Vuitton, I used to rock it like the dons
Gucci with the things not painted on
Now the days done gone, and shit done changed
I went from a bum coat to a 6 rain

[?] Bacardi razz rains, light rate chains, prints is cut meng
Cheddar like 

[Bell, Peter?] up in the club
VIP with the black heater, thug bronze, smoking on blue sticky
They see me balling in this game and they wanna hit me, called nonsense
Let's go, 

[?] ball till I fall, that's my motto, in LA, NY, even in 4's
Sitting on tractor rims, with mexicans
Took packs again, want sex again

[With a dime?] it was told with me
By that boy AKA the P.O.I

[Hook]
(We got) Big banks, big money, walking through the club like our shit don't stop

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Pit's got 'em looking out like the Tri-State Snipers, so watch out! (watch out)
When I was young, I used to drop tops and spin them
Now I'm predicted to drop tops on drops, sitting on spinners (hahaha)
And I'm not gonna stop 'til my pockets look beat up, filled up with knots
But words are spit, I'm worth more than any verse I spit, I hustle rap, I serve y'all quick
In school I never had a 4.O, but my Range Rovers' gonna' read 4.6
Teachers always told me I was a smart kid, so it's only right I push smart whips
So when I pull up pushing, something, sitting on rims older than me (older than me)
Hopping out with 

[Courtney?] and Rick Ross, Diaz and DB (DB)
Y'all can witness the come up, from a poor boy to a rich boy
It ain't my fault, y'all eat where where ya shit boy

[Verse 3: ?]

[?] the way that Ferrari vibe break the party
Collecting more chips than ladies at sex parties
Me? I, be with P.O.I, till' I'm calm
Resting in the Bronx with Chron stones to V double
Look around where you stay at, cause it's like trouble
Who watch us? My man Ricky Ross, six inch steel
Gonna toil for those who gon' test the calicoe wrist
Can't forget E-Class, sniper like, even with perif
We'll view your little sight
With so much ice, we turn night into day
We too fly, at the front of The Source Awards (Redeye)

[Verse]
My nigga I’m a road dog and all my dogs on the road
Don’t put your fingers on my whip or that bitch might explode
Some say it’s sucka proof, if you’s a trick I can tell it
I sprayed my whole damn whip with broke nigga repellent
Step away from the vehicle wish it could all be so simple but you’s a groupie
And I bought that whip right there with a cheque that I got from a fucking movie
Luda! Hollywood, Hollywood, nigga
But still rappin’ like I just got out the hood nigga
College Park where I been, Southside I’m locked in
We double-parked on my block so my block got you blocked in
I dare your ass to say something or we might just take something
Open up that can of Raid and this Glock might just spray something
You insect, we been prepped, you get wet from these ten tecks
Shoot it out, stab it out, or knuckle up and get chin checked
I’m a lover not a fighter, a nibbler not a biter but I’m all about that life dog
Try to break in my house and you might find your wife dog
But you also gonna see two dogs that attack and is ready take a bite out your ass
You could try to fight it but I’m here to let you know
I can guarantee that your fight won’t last
You gon’ be dead meat, nigga, puppy chow
I’mma be like ‘ding ding ding ding ding!’ who else is hungry now?
Come and get it my dogs’ll chew and spit it
Your body’s a wishbone and this chopper will come and skid it
Ludacris, I’m kinda crazy with these metaphors
And been with ol’ bitches gettin’ great skull like Skeletor
Big sword like He-Man, women want this seed man
Two Glocks like 2Pac, jackass like Wee Man
Time to lose that rooftop, I don’t start no key man
Decorate this Ludacris, Miss, light up that tree man
Smoke some’

[Verse]
Who woulda thought that uh
Ten years later I’d be goin’ just as hard as I was goin’ back then
Put $5,000 on the Blackjack table
Smack my girl on the butt, good luck I’m all in
The money’s callin’, pick up like 9-1-1 emergencies
To stay buyin’ weed that’s stronger than Hercules
Flex a muscle nobody’s touching my hustle
I’m ballin’ like I discovered Spalding
Swoosh, put two in the hoop
There’s only room for two in the coupe
A king with diamonds in this game like there’s two in the suit
Deal, I shuffle cards like I shuffle bars
No human growth hormone, I only muscle cars
For real, my Ferrari is Abu-Dhabi blue
Luda’s moved more crowds that a tsunami blew
Got rappers shakin’ like quakes in California
To learn how to kill a stage, just Google my show at Bonnaroo

[Verse]
Stay calm, this ain’t ‘bout to take long
Fake rappers meme muggin’ put your face on
I got some verses hot enough to broil a steak on
It’s goin down, put your emergency brake on
Your time’s up it’s like your callin’ from a payphone
It’s like I stepped in the booth and just put my cape on
In the Cadillac with fake plates on
We blowin’ bomb like the blunts filled with napalm
We got four bad chicks we bout to take off
Just tryna get they bottoms up, word up to Trey Songz
Somebody call the doctor and wait for him
I’m gettin’ neck and she about to need a brace on
I’m standing up so she can keep a straight face on
She got a ass you finna conjure case on
Boogie Nights, I’m the one the movie was based on
Entourage dyked up, I got my Vinnie Chase on
Let ‘em play with each other, have a taste-off
Then I’m the last one in like the 8 ball
All up in they dugouts, no baseball
Splatter on they chests like I hit ‘em with a paintball
Now in the clouds like Nate Dogg
Smokin’ with my family guys, no Quahog
Catch the troy weed, shit’ll take your face off
Rappers act hard, I guess they verses just play soft
Bitch ass nigga

[Verse]
Tip-toein’ in my Jordans
Got so many pairs I’m runnin’ outta space where I can store ‘em
Women used to gimme no play but nowadays they always whorin’
Givin’ me super dome like I’m playin’ for New Orleans
Luda bought a house in the Hollywood Hills all tourin’ and recordin’
Come and trespass, put the .44 up to all your major organs
Only lines that rappers got that’s dope is the ones they snortin’
Luda Abdul-Jabbar bitch, I lead the league in scorin’
Dunk on a nigga like Blake Griffin dunked on Kendrick Perkins
Women say they on they cycle and I just throw ‘em some detergent
Make it seem like you sayin’ a prayer and just get down on your knees
My favourite pairs of Jays are the 13’s and the 3’s, bitch please
Cause I’m

[Hook] x2
Tip-toein’ in my Jordans
I done came down tip-toein’ in my Jordans
Just copped a Porsche tip-toein’ in my foreigns
And you muthafuckers borin’, you sleepin’ on me, snorin’
Don’t worry cause I’m

[Verse]
I stick to the script like bubble gum, bitch, call me big league chew
Got a big body Benz and some big booty bitches
That’s what us niggas in the big leagues do
When I pull up at the lights tell your girl she better not look over
Or the bitch’ll start droolin’
We could handle it like a couple of gentlemen
Or get into some gangsta shit if she start choosin’
Ludacris you can call me Goldie
Mackin’ all in my blood, pimpin’ hereditary
First place, first class, first serve, first everything
All of you other niggas is secondary
Nothin’ to it but to do it I get a woman and break it down into pieces
She be bowing her head and be down on her knees so much
You would think she be talkin’ to Jesus
Amen, Hallelujah, good God! Preach!
When it come to a verse or a song
I’m an animal, matter fact I’m a muthafuckin’ beast
And I won’t stop til I get everybody in the industry to bow down
And these niggas want beef
So I’m tellin’ every rapper that Ludacris bout to chow down
I’m a OG in the southern part of America
Music bumpin’ up and down all in your stereo
You rappers is nothing but shit up in kitty litter
Pussy, I’m bout to bury ya
Airin’ ya out, carry ya out, carry about your business
Get smoked out and roll one
OG to another OG, “what’s up OG?” It takes one to know one
Ain’t put an album out in a minute
Been watching these rappers up in the D-League
Plus I’m still spendin’ money off my 1st, 2nd, 3rd
4th, 5th, 6th and 7th CDs
Oh, I lost count nigga, just a young playa from the south nigga
Every album went gold or platinum
So get some certified plaque and wash your mouth nigga, hold up
You weak rappers havin’ no luck, you showin’ in and showin’ out
And at your shows no one shows up
Meanwhile I’m doin’ donuts in a Lambourghini
I’m the master, bow down like 

[?]
But call me Leroy, cause I got that glow and you know that
Aw, bitin’ ass nigga get a hard ass verse
Somebody gon be like sound like Ludacris wrote that

[Pre-Chorus: Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug]
Sitting up so high, feel like my nose bleed (My nose bleed)
I left that lil' money in my old jeans (My old jeans)
And speaking of alphabets, I know OGs (OGs!)
Offshore accounts, overseas (What?)
No tint, so you know it's me

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug]
Mind on that money, mind on that money (What?), yeah, bitch
Money on mind, money on my mind (Okay, yeah)
Money on my mind, money, money on my mind (Thugger), ayy
Mind on that money, nah, money on my mind
Money on my mind
Money on my mind, mind, mind
I got the racks on my mind
I'm talkin' 'bout mine, mine

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Got them racks on me the long way
Hunnids on me, they thinner than a thong, baby
I feel like I'm on the moon way long, baby
Tell the bitch to take that like Diddy Kong, baby
Me and Quan like Jay and Ye', Watch the Throne, baby
Creepin' in that black truck just like the song say
Hey, and that car was from Malone, baby
She my ex just like Mill, oh, I'm gunning real
I told the boy I got a tip if it's dub seal
You been pussy, I see your whiskers 'bout as long as a seal
She look at me, I look by green like a Navy Seal
You cry, I swear to God, I'ma try fuck your tears

Money on my mind, mind, mind
I got the racks on my mind
I'm talkin' 'bout mine, mine

[Verse 2: Rich Homie]
Beatin' on my chest just like I'm Willie B
Swiss bank accounts, my light-skin ho look like Alicia Keys
Clean up my cars then bring 'em out, push button, don't need a key
And like the first Sunday in April, I'm on Easter pink
Double cup better have ice in it, homie heating ice with it
I'm killing these niggas every every song I'm on, they say homie need a life sentence
And all my hoes tryna' fight bitches
Call a girl a ho, don't dyke bitches
Find your spot in the dark, no night vision
'Cause I'm good at sightseeing, you feel me? (Hey)
Name two niggas you know who done came up this fast (Who?)
Plain Jane, bitch and Hublot, on that ho, I'll drop a lil' bag
I get dough, nigga, I don't get mad (Nah)
Better bring it pronto or that's your ass
No car note 'cause you know I drop cash (I did)

I'm talkin' 'bout mine, mine

[Verse 1]
There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

[Chorus]
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

[Verse 2]
There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twistin' kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

[Chorus]
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

[Outro]
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Well they say nothing is forever
Well fuck what they say I been waiting for forever
They steal the flow cause they can't think of nothing clever
I picture me on top, I couldn't paint it any better
No Genre bitch, I couldn't say it any clearer
This a brand new era
Make another error
See the face of terror
Bad news and I hate to be the bearer
9/11 and I ain't talking Panamera
Ease up, east side easel
Even if up was your kids you still couldn't keep up
I see the competition, they get ate her finger licking
No wonder I'm a pothead I was always in the kitchen
Trying to whip up decent music, give the people what they missin'
Now throw this shit and crack the system bitch

[Hook: B.o.B (Lin-Z)]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
Faded, (Bobby got the indo-do, got the indo)
I'm rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
Faded, (Bobby got the indo-do, got the indo)

[Verse 2: Jake Lambo]
See I got weed in my lungs and the world in my palm
I get stoned like a fossil and that's word to my ma'
Just splittin' swisher's like surgeons
While I ride with my niggas
The car look like a sauna, I hope the cops never get us
Get some liquor man fuck it
I only drink on occasions
But why I'm drinking I'm faded
The peer pressure I hate it
Debated it then I took a swig of some gin that we had
I don't like drinking but really I wasn't feeling too bad
Now I'm just

[Hook: B.o.B (Lin-Z)]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
Faded, (Bobby got the indo-do, got the indo)
I'm rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
Faded...

[Verse 3: Lin-Z]
Bobby got the indo
London out the window
Jake whip in the lambo
While Jaque make the beat go
Got my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin' wit' a dot, only feed her wine
Don't got the time, VIP no lyin'
And my swag is off the hizzel fo' Shizzel for nizzel
That's word to my nizzel Snoop Dizzel
Got them curls for the girls: miss frizzle

[Hook: B.o.B (Lin-Z)]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
Faded, faded
I'm rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
Faded, faded

[Outro: Lin-Z (B.o.B)]
You see nothing is forever
Well fuck what they say I been waiting for forever
They steal the flow cause they can't think of nothing clever
I picture me on top, I couldn't paint it any better
No Genre bitch, (I couldn't say it any clearer
This a brand new era, this a brand new era
Say it any clearer, this a brand new era)

Blue Jean, I just met me a girl named Blue Jean
Blue Jean, she got a camouflaged face and no money
Remember they always let you down when you need 'em
Oh, Blue Jean, is heaven any sweeter than Blue Jean

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She got a police bike
She got a turned up nose

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like
(Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean
(Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can send me
(Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me

[Verse 2]
One day I'm gonna write a poem in a letter
One day I'm gonna get that faculty together
Remember like everybody has to wait in line
Oh, Blue Jean, look out world, oh you know I've got mine

[Pre-Chorus 2]
She got Latin roots
She got everything

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel like
(Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean
(Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can tempt me
(Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody sent me

Sometimes I feel like

Jazzin' for Blue Jean

Somebody, somebody

Somebody send me

[Verse: Childish Gambino]
Tell me what the faith is, flow is on a wait list
Someone keep that shit shut, all white, no cut
I fucked up but I still came and I still reign like thunder
Everything's been done some, screamin' like we love them
But I still get what I deserve
You live, you learn, you wait your turn and you crush 'em
Fall back, all that, freshmen you're welcome
Still flip with these young hoes, still stunt with these fly clothes
Still rep for that East side where they bang toys like Tyco
I'm busy one percentin', I'm rapper Armageddon
Introducin' all that bullshit all these other niggas spittin'
Yo it's Childish, I'm wild, bitch, all white coke like scientist
Stupid busy, fuckin' with your main like a lioness
Nigga scrunch your face up, all we get it queso
All we watch is cartoons, hatin' man, that's all you
Fuckboy, that's all you, say shit when I saw you
Say shit on that online but that's fake beef like dog food
Panic room blue, too soon to be into it
These Silver Lake niggas know hood like a clitoris
Bang, bang, bang, bang, shots fired, A-Town, Empire
What you think we all about? Watchin' bitches trippin' out

[Hook]
The money turned me into a monster (Hah!)
The money turned my noodles into pasta (Hah!)
The money turned my tuna into lobster (Whoa!)
They want to do me, I maneuver like a mobster, whoa!

[Verse 1]
4 A.M., I'm on the north side of Philly
Riding around like these haters don't want to kill me
It's a shame how they hate on me, you gotta feel me
I started out with a dollar and got a milli
Jahlil Beats, holla at me!
I'm like, "Do it for the gram, ho! Do it for the gram, ho!"
She don't want to bust it, I say, "Do it for them bands, yo!"
I say, "Do it for them bands"
Fucking with that broke nigga, you should do it for your man
Lately, I've been on the low with a ho that you probably know
Took her to the crib and met momma right at the door
Momma started smiling like, "Momma, I gotta go"
I done took so many trophies to momma
My momma know her son a real nigga
I get that money, pay them bills, nigga
My momma told me, "You a real nigga"
And I be hanging with them real killers
Now, what a feeling
When you looking at the latest whip and knowing you can cop it
Or looking at the baddest bitch and knowing you could pop it
The youngest nigga in my city doing it, I got it
On that other line with Benjamin, and money is the topic, Lord!

[Hook]
The money turned me into a monster (Hah!)
The money turned my noodles into pasta (Hah!)
The money turned my tuna into lobster (Whoa!)
They want to do me, I maneuver like a mobster, whoa!

[Bridge]
I put my jeweler on his feet (On his feet)
Hundred thou, I used to do that every week (Every week)
Never sleep, it's funny how it never speak (Never speak)
You see a foreign in my city, that was Meek, whoa!

[Verse 2]
That was us, never sweet (Never sweet)
We went to war, niggas riding down the street (Brr-r-r!)
Popping that pistol they talking they never deep (Never deep)
Dropping that nickel out something with leather seats
I've been sitting on that money like a chair (Like a chair)
I've been getting to that money all year (All year)
All year and my niggas all here
But we started from the bottom, we was selling hard squares
Baddest bitch in the game wearing my chain, I'm ready
Switching lanes in that Mulsanne like Andretti (Skrt!)
I do the Balmain, Balenciaga, no Giuseppe
If they sleep on Meek Milly, I kill these niggas like I'm Freddy, oh!
I eat that pussy like a monster (Monster)
She gon' ride the dick, she need a sponsor (Ah!)
You could tell I'm Philly from my posture (You know!)
And we be whipping coca like it's pasta, whoa!
I be all money (All money)
Two milli, four milli—no, I need more money (More money)
I get that "see a bad bitch and be like, 'How you doing?'" money
They like, "How you doing, honey?" OH!

[Hook]
The money turned me into a monster (Hah!)
The money turned my noodles into pasta (Hah!)
The money turned my tuna into lobster (Whoa!)
They want to do me, I maneuver like a mobster, whoa!

[Bridge]
I put my jeweler on his feet (On his feet)
Hundred thou, I used to do that every week (Every week)
Never sleep, it's funny how it never speak (Never speak)
You see a foreign in my city, that was Meek, whoa!

[Intro]
The kid is back uh , turn me up Cruz

[Verse1]
The revolution shall be televised
This year it's all about us so fuck the other side
Gotta get killed on camera for us to come alive
Well shit we dead already from all this homicide
In my cell hangin' from a rope
Where you get less time for rape than for sellin' dope
When you get the same time for dope then you do a murder
Innocent 'til guilty, guilty the verdict
Before you even started that Harley, no we ain't notice
Cause we was goin' to war with ourselves over that coca
And they was tryna hurt us, lock us so far in the mountains
Couldn't get no service and our families couldn't service us
Fightin' a silent war with a silencer
Like racin' a Lamborghini with a Challenger
And the feds gon' follow us
Label us as terrorists and then they drop bombs on us
And we turn to media, they lie to us
Nobody really speakin' on them courtrooms that bodied us
Labeled us as hooligans, we trappin' and we movin' it
Kids barely eatin' at that table with that tuna fish
Breakfast and lunchtime Mama ordered the noodle dish
Dinner time I was on the corner, me and Lucifer
Who you s'posed to call when the cops the ones shootin' you?
Nobody
Talked to the Shmurdas and I told 'em keep their head up
And when you touch down, stay focused and get your bread up
Cause when you're gettin' to it the people be gettin' fed up
They buildin' brand new jails for us, don't make your bed up
Use your head, dog, and beware
Certain niggas just ain't good for you dont bring them near ya
I'm young, black, and I get money, my swag serious
America's worst nightmare, I'm what they're scared of
Fresh back home, they had to sit me down
I come back home, they talkin' Nicki now?
I spit like a drummer that hold 50 rounds
And for my walkthroughs it cost 60 pounds
Of Sour D, Hollywood, I should be
But that hood shit bring the hood out of me
I be on the 'gram like I hit the lottery
Buyin' every car, every house I see, tryna be
A gangsta, I was tryna be a king
You're tryna score a point, I was tryna get a ring
Couple niggas got happy, heard I was in the bing
'Til they let me out my cell, I jumped right up in that sink
Balenciaga red interior, they're inferior
I made a couple milli in jail, I'm dead serious
Monkey ass hoes like George and head curious
Flow so wavy man I should've been an aquarius
I'm talkin' to Hov on the jail call
Get so many letters that they thinkin' it's mail fraud
When I fell on the money they said that I fell off
We got like, 6 mansions, 12 lofts
3 condos, any apartments? Hell naw
Just all penthouses, nigga I've been 'bout it
Gets in, gets out it, like it's a robbery
I came up from the bottom and ain't no stoppin' me nigga
Well it's been 5 years, can't hold back my tears
Cause I'm just so happy I'm marrying an angel today
Oh. As I take your hand, I'll pledge to be your man
I vow to love, to hold, to cherish and never disrespect
The love we share

I'll be honest, I cannot lie, there'll be real good days
There'll be some bad times. I'll be standing right beside you
My sweet baby with my love of mine

And you take this ring, and I'll place it on your sweet and loving hand
We will show our kids, they will tell their kids what mom and daddy did
On the day I'm marrying my angel. I love you my angel

[Verse 1]
All day I face the barren waste
Without a taste of water
Cool water
Old Dan and I, our throats slate dry
Our spirits cry out for water
Cool clear water

[Chorus]
Keep on movin' Dan
Some devil's had a plan
Buried poison in the sand
Don't drink it, man
It's in the water
Cool clear water

[Bridge]
In my mind I see a big green tree
And a river flowin' free
Waitin' up ahead for you and me
Cool clear water

[Verse 2]
The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star's a pool of water
Cool water
But come the dawn, we carry on
We won't last long without water
Cool clear water

[Chorus 2]
Keep on movin' Dan
We're still in no-man's land
Dry bones and sand
People never planned here for water
Cool clear water

[Bridge]
In my mind I see a big green tree
And a river flowin' free
Waiting up ahead for you and me
Cool clear water

[Verse 3]
The shadows sway, they seem to say
Tonight we pray for water
Cool water
And way up there, if you care
Please show us where there's good water
Cool clear water

Verse: 1 (Jake Lambo)
These niggas ain't really all that, tryna be on top like a cap on a bald head
Friends told me that they wouldn't cross me and they all did
I'm just getting busy killin' rappers, leave 'em all dead
All I know is us, bro, fuck what y'all said
Ray 's in the jungle so my best friend 's Tarzan
Want it? Imma get it, pull strings like harp players
Young ones tryna ball, but I don't really walk near
I be grindin', I'm grindin', I'm grindin', I'm grindin', I do
Won't catch me slippin', man, they just be trippin'
They trippin', I tell em to lace up your boots
Doing what I want, don't play by the rules
I'm not a teacher, but you can get schooled
She not a lightbulb, but she can get screwed
He  just be lethal when he's in the booth
I don't know people, I sit with my crew
Do get it, my right, no left
Oh yes let em know I want some more checks
My girl be trippin', I work it out like both flex
Your girl keep trippin', be askin' me for more sex
Oh, what you wanna do?
Tryna get this money, tell em follow me like vamanos
Spot em like a domino, Hit 'em with the dummy flow
This ain't the future, you got me shinin' like a dinosaur

Do tricks, your honor
She get the wood acoustic, your honor
She act like she don't do shit, your honor
But she walked here like the shoe fits, your honor
And those ain't retro, she blowin' me, ex though, she sit in the Esso
Is  she with you, cuz I go a prime ape in the chimp too
You Charlie errin', this hurricane fixes you
So when the cameras rollin', better act right, bitch
But side chicks only get the half-pipe, bitch
These niggas turn on you than they jack-knife, bitch
I protectin' all my green, holla' cacti, bitch
(Ahhh)
Fit your'e bright, cocaine crack white bitch
Get a CAT scan all we see is pussy in you
No wonder you out here movin' so cat-like bitch
My Negro, I been on my shit though
I'm an influenza, you been on your menstrual
You ain't even understand. you ain't even on your ten toes
Boy, I just be sketchin' on your lady with my pencil
And so, Eraser broke, but if you raise a ho
Imma carve her into stone, Your Michaelangelo
Might turn her into a banking roll, turn on the channel ho

Never really rode on four wheels
She can ride a surfboard like a pro still
I keep the money on auto like mobile
Eat it out the box in the morning like oatmeal
Nigga, I'm straight. Imma send her home before I hug 3rd base
I'm shelf, bitch. Sell like I'm on eBay and niggas want beef like the FDA
We could up these stakes, with a side of some Vino Blanco, Torpedo Launch code
Close curtains on 'em, I don't need Article
A nigga mile-high like the Denver Broncos
I'm so high, they like, "have you see where Bob goes?"
Pussy weed and Presidents x2
Heard you hatin' on the squad right?
Well, suck my dick like its a peppermint
Wakin' up to residents, cameras poppin', Serve bands a lot

Beatin up the block, Jay Lambo, and Bob
6 Bitches, three legs, tarantula
But she on the tris on the

[Verse 1]
There's no need to fear me
Darling, I love you as you are when you're alone
I'll never try to change you
As if I could, and if I were to, what's the part that I'd miss most?
When you're smiling and astride me
I can hardly believe I've found you and I'm terrified by that

[Verse 2]
I've got nothing to hide from you
Kissing my brother in my dreams or finding God knows in my jeans
You see me as I am, it's true
The aimless, fake drifter, and the horny, man-child, Mamma's boy to boot
That's how you live free
To truly see and be seen
I've got those pinpoint pupils
I've got those nodding head rolls
I've got a dangerous pulse!!

Cut me off from this world please tourniquet

Re-draw the line
I can't stop lying about the lines I'm cooking
I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO LIVE
Shut up!

It's like the spoons are disappearing from the kitchen counter
I keep them hidden in the bathroom with my new found lover
Getting number, I'm my brother, brother

My body is here, but my mind is worlds away
Worlds away
My mind is worlds away
How can I be the one, to tell you it wasn't me
Every time I said this is me, when it wasn't
Who do you trust?? Him or me??
He is Me!!!
I'm disappearing in the bathroom with my new found lover!

There goes my brain
There goes my brain
There goes my brain!

Weep while I rot…weep while I rot!

Inside my mind, I feel perfect
Back to real life, I feel different

I don't know me anymore!
It means nothing at all, to take what I need:
I'll steal shit from your drawers cause my arm is thirsty!

I've just about convinced myself that this is what I needed!

It's like the spoons are disappearing from the kitchen counter
I keep them hidden in the bathroom with my new found lover
Getting number, I'm my brother

[Verse 1]
We're all chemicals, vitamins and minerals
And vicodin with inner tubes, wrapped around the arm
To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
Top Cat chat, let's begin another yarn
That's flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm'?
But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy
So what powers cowards to get them to the top
Just to fall asleep listening to Bach?
The ribbon in the sky is the ribbon that I drop
Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
That lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading
They catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?
And what's the talking without the match feeling
That's buried living, And cherry picking
Every lemon from your berry system
Then proceed with the pack feeding
When I was young I had visions of another world
Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother HurL
Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
I like my pancakes cut in swirls
Moroccan moles and undercover squirrels
I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons
Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms
Apologize for my weird mix
What taste like hot dogs and tear drips
And looks like pantomime and clear bricks
And smells like shotguns and deer piss
They on their hunt, kind of salty that I'm going hard
First part of a party, that I throw in parts
One minute you're playing pool, next minute you're throwing darts
But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars
I run the Gambit like I'm throwing cards
From Popular Mechanics to overdosing heart/hard
Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
Nerd gang, make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
Backup the wordplay ain't playing that the man's states
Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
And when demand brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face
My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base
The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine
That hovers above cities like weather men
Or maybe weather woman
Whatever better to tell ya weather comin'
I prefer girls to reign all over the world
And not rain like, rain man or rain like rain dance
Or rain like a slight chance of rain when it's raining
Or rein like deer slaves to Santa Claus sleigh man
But Reign like Queens that reign over made man
And not Queen like Queen killer, rhapsody bohemian Queen
But Queen like white glove wave hand, and not wave hand, like it's a heat wave
So you make a fan by waving your hand, I'm talking wave, like you saying, "Hey man!"
And not hay for horses, and hoarse is like you almost voiceless
You gotta treat your vocal chords like it's a fortress
And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements
And especially when you're recording
Cause that's the portion that's important
When I was reporting that I was poor, but now I'm more than
It's still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots
Crying shames, make margarita rims from cheap tops
Deep plots, in floor to ceiling windows for my pee pots
A little scene, with the sickle swings, to make the wheat drop
And a hundred words, for them hummingbirds, that like to eavesdrop
And fan out like peacocks, with a parakeet that beat box
So the sun rise when the beat drop, and the sun dies when the beat stops...
Then it unties, then it relocks, then it relapse, then it detox
Then heat back like a heat pack on his knee caps of the weak spot
Cause he want what we got, like yeah

[Verse 2]
Then forge poetry, like a young ornery Morrissey
Then spit it to the golden locks thots, who like their porridge all watery
Not scorching nor sorbet-y
From the steel orbitings, sorcerer of sorcery
Coming down gorgeously, just like a Stacey Dash waterfall
A more torturing, a water-boarding Barbie doll
A river of women like Brazilian Carnival
Swimming in feminine bikinis made out of Barbasol
Somebody give them the volleyballs
If you love her, don't ever send her to Mally Mall's
Homie, if she lonely she might end up in Macauly's claws
Coming out the closet over goblets, down at Mardi Gras
The fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call
My rap position was black condition and activism
Ammunition for abolition, missions attacking systems
But they not apt to listen, unless it's dropping on Activision
Are we apps, or are we bodies filled with apparitions?
Operating applications, stuck inside an Apple prison
Chicken hackin’ download updates that lack religion
Or are we more...
...Than soil tainting, disloyal changelings
Preoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing, and foiling other's royal saintings?
I sit back and watch the world through eye holes in my oil paintings
Uhhh! Ain't nothin' to it, but to do it
Unless you Virgin Mary, nothin' do it but the truest
Believe all that, unless you Jewish
Life is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus
And I feel like a missionary, to a clitoris
The water bearer, heir of traditions, that I swear to never change
My chair position or conditions of my porridge
Submission for sedition against the religion of a chorus
Keep them golden weave thieves out the mothafuckin' forest
As I perform a nerd storm, I prefer my pictures in word form
Bury the hatchet like how a bird born
As I paint cold pictures, like Kool-Aid facing condensation
Having conversations with flavorful combinations
Slave to my concentration
So that's OJ da Juiceman, meets OJ with two hands
And two gloves, that's too snug, to judge who was, who drew blood
And, Lupe look at all these toucans, in a cemetery full of tomahawks
Giving middle fingers to the pigeons doing somersaults
Road runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across
Anomalies by the colony, flukes by the reservoir
Wildin' pursuers end up as poofs, on the desert floor
Levitating youths, who know the truth of where the fountain hides
Buckaroo roof painting tunnels onto the mountain sides
A thousand parts, a pound of heart, an ounce of eyes
Announcing now, the doubt in mouth, pronounces out a count of lies
Chocula Counts by the count of five
Refrigerator roof, full of animals and monsters
Incinerator chutes and the manual for Contra
Assorted memories from my childhood
Absorbing energy from the wild woods
Electronic combat Konami sign contract
Chinese chalk killing cucarachas on contact
Chicago, spray gun aficionado
Efficient spitting bridging divisions isn't Chicano
Who’s the Boss? If it isn't Alyssa Milano
Dudikoff, ninja mission into the Congo
Polarize envy of the older guys
Black obi, shinobi hittin' Kenno in the face with all my throwin' knives
Sub-zero, Gaiden, hiding, Raiden in the pack as well
Sound village, Leaf village, wolf spirit, magic spells
Dodging Rain and catching hail
Faith seers need samurais to catch the L
Special research vessels made for catching whales
Filet-o-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails
Rewrite history, liberty needs a better bell
Maybe harder irons and carbon fibers that never fail
Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairy tale
Or maybe just a metal pail you hit with steel tools
To announce that you've had enough and dropping out of SEAL school
Just like trout jumping out their house to let their gills cool
Cuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool
Yeah, I said it feels cool to kill fools
Slipping through the cracks like when you try to grill gruel
Techno Viking water bottle and not following pill rules
Will have you off the throttle when you should be modelin' chill mood
Roller skater maker or are you just cobblin' wheel shoes
Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews
Oblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes whenever his quill moves over your milieu
Simple as a Buddhist monk in a temple standing in some heel groove with the abbot, practising stillness
Real Steel til' he realize his realness
Defeat Samsara, achieves nirvana and brilliance
Yeah!

Baby if you diggin' me, we can kiss and touch and love on the weekend
Baby if you diggin' me, we can kiss and touch and love on the weekend
Baby if you diggin' me, we can kiss and touch and love on the weekend

[Verse 1]
I know you got all dressed up for the club
Waiting on them to come pick you up
Baby, ooh, when I saw ya walking out the door
Ooh, I just knew ya needed something more
Now whip it straight back to the crib, ay
Finna give you something that you won't forget, no
Baby, ooh, I just wanna get you out them clothes

[Chorus]
Slow motion

[Chorus]
Slow motion

In slow motion
We can take, we can take, we can take our time, stay here

[Produced by Dr. Dre & Mel-Man]

[Intro]
May I have your attention please
May I have your attention please
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up
We're gonna have a problem here

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a White person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her butt worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture
It's the return of the... "ah wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he"
And Dr. Dre said...nothin' you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's under the tombstone again (ha ha)
All of these women love Eminem
"Chigga chigga chigga Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who," "yeah, but he's so cute though"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's going on when you don't let loose
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for your mom to cook me a dead moose
"Kim never gave me a kiss, Kim never gave me a kiss"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give Kim a little flip
We ain't nothing but mammals -- well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other rappers open like antelopes
But if we can kill animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

[Hook x2]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do; so he sucks and so do you
You think I give a damn about a Grammy
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears
This woman put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee"
I should download an audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you made the whole world garbage to me
I'm sick of you 

[little girl and boy groups,] all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me; who just don't give a stuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the 

[balls] to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just crap it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like his name is Caleb
It's funny; cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
Every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling
With his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go

[Hook]

Ha ha, I guess there’s a Slim Shady in all of us
Damn it, let’s all stand up

[Intro]
I'm so sorry, so sorry... woo
This-this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
And I'm so sorry

[Hook]
Uh
Sorry for the wait, nigga
Glock 40 for them fake niggas
Throw a party every day, nigga
That's an ordinary day, nigga
Bad bitch in mi casa
No mi casa su casa
My choppa go Doom-dada
Dayahyahyahda!

[Verse]
Tunechi, bitch
On my Future shit
I'm too legit
I sleep on a crucifix
I wake up cranky and turn into a lunatic
Then shoot my bitch
Behind orange juice and grits
Uzi clip
I need another Uzi clip
I shoot to kill
These pussy niggas shooting bricks
I'm too for real
Your head just a souvenir
She wanna get it off her chest
But her boobs too big
I'm bumping Carter 5
On a iPod
My bitch mad as hell cause it ain't out yet
She said "Soon as these niggas hear your new shit
They gon' have to give they styles back"
I said "You too cray"
She said "You too humble"
I said "You too, bae"
She said "You too sweet"
Then I ask her do she go both ways
She say "They do say love is a two-way street"
I say "Oooh"
Talk dirty, talk dirty, dirty, talk dirty to me
Treat that girl like cuisine
She gon' wanna shoot scenes
Put my dick in museum
I'm gon' die on my feet
Never knees in the dirt
Never dirt on my knees
I'm just serving these fiends
Sell birds to the bees
I sell birds to the trees
"Tune, I heard you don't sleep"
I'm allergic to dreams
I don't twerk, but I tweak
For that purple, that pink
Yeah you see what I'm saying
Like you heard what you see
I'm a verbal disease
I'm allergic to me
Been a turd on these streets
Since my curtains was sheets
Chef on these beats
I'm just stirring the grease
That bitch you in love with
She working for me
I personally
Get you murdered this week
Like that blunt between my two fingers
I'm at peace
Word
I smirk when I squeeze
Trigger smart, street smart
I'm a nerd, I'm a geek
I'm absurd, I'm unique
Did my time at Cash Money
Time served and released
But this agent ain't free
Word
That's the word on these streets
But that shit is old news
That shit's so yesterweek
I'm just focused
Focused on my expertise
They like "Tunechi, you good?"
I'm like "Bob, yessiree!"
Now don't, I mean don't
Don't question me
Let me breathe
Dog, big dog
I cock back and shoot at ya fleas
Money long – Tree trunk
Now stand under me
Catch these leaves
I guarantee no guarantees
But repeat what you heard
You a dead parakeet
It's Tunechi, bitch
Your bitch Tunechi's bitch
I fuck her on my balcony
We watch the moon eclipse
We do unusual shit
She gonna need lube for this
'Cause I'mma stick it in her maximus gluteus
We at the top of the world
She like the view and shit
From up here everybody look the puniest
The coke got her all exuberant
She doing lines like a movie script
But these are true events
Lord
I'll kill a nigga right now
I'll put a nigga lights out
Then put his body in a ice box
With holes in his body like socks
These niggas softer than
These niggas softer than nylon
So keep my name out your mouth
I hope it taste like cayenne
Looking up at the skyline
I'm thinking to my fuckin' self
"You only live twice, slime"
And motherfuck you if you fight crime
I'm from a place with a high crime rate, like Iran
We put your ass on Nightline
I'm on the grass like a python
These niggas looking at me
These niggas looking at me sideways
That's because they on the sideline
But they never tried mine
Spittin' like I'm sippin' cyanide
While my bitch sip a Mai Tai
But she wine fine
And I'm so sorry
She say "Don't be sorry"
Woo
Then she say "Don't apologize for shit
'Cause you the shit
And we know Tha Carter 5 the shit"
Woah
Woo

[Hook]
But this is that Sorry 4 The Wait, nigga
Glock 40 for them fake niggas
Throw a party every day, nigga
That's an ordinary day, nigga
Bad bitch in mi casa
No mi casa su casa
My choppa go Doom-dada
Dayahyahyahda!
Ayy

[Outro]
And I'm so sorry for the wait too
I'm so sorry, so sorry; woo
This-this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
And I'm so sorry, so sorry

[Intro: Ludacris]
Don't get it fucked up...
Over 15 million sold, damn it
I don't plan on stopping no time soon
I'm at the end of my deal, goddamn it
Look here mayne

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I'm the truth what I speak shall set you free
First boy to put a booth inside his SUV
So now I'm rapping and riding at the same time
Hitting hydraulics in your neighborhood
My car is throwing gang signs
Flip the switch and unleashed the top
I got the key to my city and unleashed the block
We put some keys in the hemi and it unleashed the cop
Then we unleashed the AKs, and they put down they Glocks
So many whips stopped think it was a roadblock
Trunk filled with more stuffin' than a stove top
Go-go gadget, click-click, I got them robots
And dick for the bitches served hard, they'll get cold-cocked
Ludacris nigga, don't get it twisted ho
Your money short, my shit is standing on its tippy-toe
And you's a silly ho, thinking I won't split ya
I'm like Picasso on the mic, get the fuckin' picture

[Verse 1]
It's a mystery night
Like a sawed-off shotgun
In the morning light, it comes to anyone
All the strings that follow you
And the things they're tied to
My love's behind you
Colored by the snow
The shine is gone

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to know what made you wet
Now I'm searching for it
'Cause it's a mystery all the same
Now to get you back

[Chorus 1]
On holiday
With a broken camera
And all I say
Is "I could be happier"
I could be happier

[Verse 2]
It's a mystery night
And I thought we had fun
But in the morning light
Your car's already gone
Do the things I wanna do
Not the ones I'm supposed to
Why can't I get close to
The man I saw in me
When I was young

[Chorus 2]
On holiday
With a broken camera
And all I say
Is "I could be happier"
And all I say
Is "I could be happier"

[Verse 3]
I run away, I'm free
From all the shadows that follow me
If all the branches are to break
Resolve my faith
Destiny and fate
'Cause I never wanna go away tonight
The cameras, the camera
I never wanna open up my eyes
The cameras, the camera

[Interlude]
Your cameras, your camera

[Outro]
'Cause I never wanna go away tonight
I never wanna open up my eyes

[Verse 1]
Here it goes
Chemical is on its way
And my box is packed
Or should I stay? (it's coming)
We can analyze, philosophize
But who's to say
All we know is
We're here today

[Chorus]
Look in my eyes
This is just the reason why I stay
I know there are things we shouldn't say
Blame it on the reason why I came
Maybe cause I couldn't feel the
Pain

[Verse 2]
Fight the fear
Taste the grip
Feel the slip
Shake the soul
Feel the waves
In and out, and in and out, and in and out

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Feel the weight wash away
All the mistakes I've made
Living in time on my own
Tearing the soul from bone
Letting the tide suck me in
And chemicals burst in
These are my only friends
Giving me waves until the end
Ooooooh

[Intro]
Hey Hey Hey!

[Verse 1]
Yeah we sleep in cars
Oh so far from home
Watch the sun go down
On the open road
I've been searching for this
Part of my life

Then the sun will rise
We'll be driving slow
Watch the kids fly by
On their telephones
I've been racing all my life
And now I'm free

[Chorus]
Well, I know I was born for this
Every night I dreamt of it
In my hooome
In my hoo-oh-ome

[Verse 2]
Fast the moon approaches
And with hungry eyes
We'll be lighting torches
We'll be mesmerized
I've been yearning for this
Cover of night

When the stars come out
You are stereo
Where we going dear
I don't know

[Chorus]
Well, I know I was born for this
Every night I dreamt of it
In my hooome
In my hoo-oh-ome

[Verse 3]
We are not lost
We're just searching
We are always, always searching for
Home
(Hey hey hey!)
We'll be going dear
Bright lights
I don't know, I fear
I'm paralyzed
I'm paralyzed

[Outro]
In my hoo-oo-ome
In my hoo-oh-ome
And we are not lost
We're just searching
We are always, always searching for
(Hey hey hey!)
Home

[Verse 1]
Teachers
They try to
Reach us
They said it too, you know
But now you're grown up
And it's time
You were tested
This city made you gold and only when you fucked up
Do you miss the friends?
The names you crossed off

[Chorus 1]
And I know it's hard to be sane
Temptation is so friendly
I need this release now
I'll find the keys that freed me

[Verse 2]
I'm awake
In a parking lot
Where are all the friends
The names are crossed off
Won't you ask me
Are you in love with the city?
All the stars
Whiskey bars
And I'm on my back I'm waiting
Yeah, you could say that I'm praying
Will I remember
Where I misplaced you?

[Chorus 2]
And I know it's hard to be sane
Temptation is so friendly
You come back
To see it
The fever
You feel it
I need this release now
I'll find the keys that freed me

[Verse 3]
I'm awake
In a car
Hollywood
Boulevard
Is this who you are?
Oh!
Run now!
Run now!

[Outro]
I need this release now
I'll find the keys that freed me

[Verse 1]
Paralyzed, on the floor again
Lately I've been fiending
Cause it's over, I'm stupid
Living a lie on my own, so alone
You're calling consistently
But I'm paralyzed on the floor far from you

[Chorus]
And lately I've been thinking
I'm not feeling anything at all
Will I survive in the dead of night?
And now the lights are fading faster
Save me from my disaster, my disaster

[Verse 2]
Lay the lights down low
God only knows I give up to the fire
You didn't always come up from the water
I only thought you were crying from laughter
Saving myself from the mouth of a monster
Paralyzed on the floor again
Baby I've been fiending

[Chorus]
And lately I've been thinking
I'm not feeling anything at all
Will I survive in the dead of night?
And now the lights are fading faster
Save me from my disaster, my disaster

[Chorus 2]
Paralyzed on the floor
And lately I've been feeling
I'm not thinking anything at all
Will I survive in the dead of night?
And now the lights are fading faster
Save me from my disaster, my disaster

[Outro x2]
God only knows I give up to the fire
You didn't always come up from the water
I only thought you were crying from laughter
Saving myself from the mouth of a monster

[Skit: The Lady of Rage & Jewell]
With someone else's lover, lover
Back in bed again
Yes, may I help you?
Hello, I had a twelve o' clock appointment with Dr. Dre
Well, Dr. Dre is with another patient right now
Would you like to reschedule?
Reschedule? Um, it must be a mistake
I must see him, I had a twelve o'clock appointment
No, it's no mistake, look, Dr. Dre is with another patient
Either you can wait or reschedule
Look, I understand all of that, but
No, apparently you don't understand
You know I'm a working person and
And I'm working too
Just where is Dr. Dre? I need to see him
Well, open up the door and you'll see his big dick fucking somebody

[Skit: Dr. Dre]
You like that?
Like that?
Yes, yes
You like that?
Give it to me
I'ma give it to you
I'ma give it to you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh
Damn, you're good
Why do we do this?
Why do we chase after dreams?
So stupid
So useless
Why am I foolish?
Why am I made out to be translucent?
Can't see through this
No way
I'm gone
Why does it hurt?
What do I deserve?
Just say the word and I'm gone
I'm gone
I'm gone
You don't have to be this way
You can hold what you say
And it don't have to be this hard
I'm lost, I'm gone
I'm lost, I'm gone
I'm gone
I'm gone

[Chorus]
You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine
You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine

[Verse 1]
With a platinum plaque, it's like Robbin, George, and Jack
The mind fears what the blinds hide but I'm here on the blind side
Hanging up 'til the line dies then off the hook for the crimes tried
Get awful looks from tribe tribe, unlawful jux when you climb skies
That's Robin Hood, arrows of the rich'll steal
In Hollywood and featherweight, I step by step, let it escalate
'Til you get it, will tell you if I hit it
We can make pie if we don't fidget
Xzibit, Pimp My Ride exquisite
We G's coach us back if we die in business, my Lord is my chemist
My sword is from Khemet, Egyptian fonts and ankhs
Scottish writes with Montblancs let us stomp
I walk as my father walk, master builder is what I thought

[Chorus]
You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine
You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine

[Verse 2]
Where the golden means, so the overseer gets overseen
And the over here's are the older things
Can see the bell but don't know the rings
The rings are not sounds, but circles, wear these on your virtues
See through these circles just like Steve Urkel, 'til it's all universal
And it harmonize in like proportion to the larger size
And it's dynamic in the high standard
So each degree has a part to price
See big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity
And little whirls have lesser worlds and so on to viscosity

[Chorus]
You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine
You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine

[Verse 3]
The applause of patrons at the laws in nature
Override lies and the laws of nations
Pilgrims bear witness at all the stations
Sun positions overcome traditions
Numbers govern our young religions
Dead levels making plumb decisions
Perpendicular to the undivision
That's bad curricular to the unconditioned
Any love less than unconditional is so
Under-Christian, it's unrepentant
The physical part of my church
Emits the invisible arts of my work
To make gold from garbage
Is not the alchemical point of this math
But truth be told it's the pursuit of gold
That turns the goal of men into trash
The soul's gold and they turning gold into cash
And your reflection is your connection
To more collections of more directions and paths
If your reflection is a mask, then you're reflective of mass
To see yourself just look at me then split your reflection in half

[Chorus]
You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine
You look just like how I'ma be
Sacred geometry
In a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line
Three angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine

The King
When you’re king of African music you’re the King
Because music is the king of all professions
(N.U. Music)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Best laid plan, make a mess, made
Damnation, let's play hands, sans spades
That's without, a boycott and a sit-out
Afro-Black pick in with a fist out
From the "Welcome Home" to the kick out
Reach into a rabbit, pull a trick out
Preacher preaching to a faggot with his dick out
Hard times call for armed time, hmm
Sick, sick, sick eyes from the nose pressure
Police snip zip ties on the protesters
Six wives in the fry of a molester
Met him at a caviar bar out in Odessa
Dirty needles breaking all the old records
A hundred hoes, one shovel and some old treasure
Ole Zeke use teeth as a gold tester
Finger rolls, finger waves, closet full of old leathers
Old sweaters, old boots, that's a whole suit for some cold weather
New sale, two L's and some old letters
Now he doing double life, while she lead a double life
Man, he need another wife
New approach might help a nigga bowl better
New hoes might help a nigga hold together
Or will the new lane lead 'em to the same pen?
And the hunger strike in 'em to the same tin

[Chorus 1: Lupe Fiasco & Nikki Jean]
Love is looking over various errors
And hate is habitually accelerating terror
Everywhere, but the mirror, oh
I just wanna be collected when I call god damn
I don't wanna be accepted; not at all as I am
Visitor, visitor, prisoner, prisoner, land

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Getting slammed from the protest, no food
Force fed him like OB with a nose tube
Visions say consult the yogi with the gold shoes
With the Rollie going bowling for the old school
(Yeah) I need more for the Michaels
That's a loss for the class and a score for the rifles
Three hots and a cot and some cops
Trying to find dinosaurs in the Bible
It's all quiet in the jailhouse
Then they ride in to find the empty cells out
They was looking for the swords
They was looking for the swords
I'm just looking at they feet 'cause I'm looking for the Lord
Looking in the library, looking at the law
10 years deep, now I'm looking at the bar
Claim sovereignty 'cause I'm bunkin' with the Moors
They degenerate, they ain't looking at the game
They just looking at the scores, they be putting on my books
'Cause I'm looking at the stars, trade a shank for some crank
Now I'm looking at a war, BGF got the yard
AB got the kitchen, snitches on PC
M&M on a mission but C.O.'s got the prison
God got us all, God set us free
God is the key, but the guards got the doors

[Chorus 1: Lupe Fiasco & Nikki Jean]
Love is looking over various errors
And hate is habitually accelerating terror
Everywhere, but the mirror, oh
I just wanna be collected when I call god damn
I don't wanna be accepted; not at all as I am
Visitor, visitor, prisoner, prisoner, land

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Punching on the glass
Scared that some killer might fuck him in the ass
Staff getting rigid, wasn't gon' take away the visits
Segregate niggas by theyself and make 'em stay with it
Wicked, swung the shank around on a mop string
They had to pull him out the cell with a SWAT team
That's a cop team
They sent hella cops to stop, the helicopteriiiing...
Man, he'd thought that he'd fly away
Like a kite, take flight, like a letter on a string
Like propellers on a wing (but the kite was the key)
They made electric chairs for his dying days
Last meals, no appeals for him to try and stay
On Death Row like Suge and the late Pac
Maybe he could dig a tunnel outta A Block
And wear gloves for the razor-wired gate top
Scared thugs going crazy in a caged box
Looking at the world through the TV
And they gone, rapping over beats from the tabletops
Ay! That's how it is in a police state
When your life is just a number and release date
When you're rehabilitated so correctly
And let's hope that's how you're living when you're set free

[Chorus 1: Lupe Fiasco & Nikki Jean]
Love is looking over various errors
And hate is habitually accelerating terror
Everywhere, but the mirror, oh
I just wanna be collected when I call god damn
I don't wanna be accepted; not at all as I am

The orange wings of the new Jim Crow
Are dyed Klansman sheets and court papers
Dreadlocks nooses hang from his neck as the new Jim Crow
Corporations feed him seeds yet unborn
He’ll be captured by Maya in a ruby-encrusted cage
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
And answers that I leave in empty pages to be written
Where is your pen? The new Jim Crow
(The new Jim Crow, the new Jim Crow, Crow, Crow, Crow, Crow)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
They sell they souls, they sell they selves
They ain't twelve, they old, niggas old as hell
Old as jail, old as cells
Sold so much salt, ain't no more salt on the shelves
You a prisoner too, you living here too
You just like us, til' your shift get through
You could look like us, you know shit get through
You should be in cuffs like us, you should get strike two
You should get like life, you should get like woo!
You should get that twice, you should get refused
The open road, that's no parole, and no control
Over your own soul, so control
Your own remote control that your folks can hold

[Chorus 2: Lupe Fiasco]
You better watch these niggas (en garde)
If it was up to me, I would never unlock these niggas
Wouldn't rehabilitate, man, I would just box these niggas
And throw away the key
I'd throw away the key like the coast guard watching me
I'd throw away the keys
I'd throw away the keys, I'd throw away the keys
You better watch these niggas (en garde)
If it was up to me, I would never unlock these niggas
Wouldn't rehabilitate, I would just box these niggas
And throw away the keys
I'd throw away the keys like the coast guard watching me
I'd throw away the keys
I'd throw away the keys, I'd throw away the keys
You better watch these niggas (en garde)

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
5th year with the DOC
Do you see what's the C.O. see?
Robocop opt to his C-O-P
Three hots and a C-O-T
Lived in a small town, his whole life
Never left like soundin' like the hole, right?
Either working at the prison, or it's no lights
In the system working with the police
In the prison stripping niggas phone rights
Got a malice, on the other side of the bars
Watching niggas get smart, watching niggas get strong
Watching niggas get home, he jail us
But deep down he jealous
With each sweep down, he tell us
With each beatdown, he help us
Wrong one gon' knock his ass out though
It's why he gotta lock all the niggas out for
Warden told the boy he better calm down
Step back from the brink and put the bomb down
But how the whole world in your palm sound?
It's why they treat niggas like shit
Writing raps to the taps
Keep the face mask on 'em, these niggas might spit

[Chorus 2: Lupe Fiasco]
You better watch these niggas (en garde)
If it was up to me, I would never unlock these niggas
Wouldn't rehabilitate, man, I would just box these niggas
And throw away the key
I'd throw away the key like the coast guard watching me
I'd throw away the keys
I'd throw away the keys, I'd throw away the keys
You better watch these niggas (en garde)
If it was up to me, I would never unlock these niggas
Wouldn't rehabilitate, I would just box these niggas
And throw away the keys
I'd throw away the keys like the coast guard watching me
I'd throw away the keys
I'd throw away the keys, I'd throw away the keys
You better watch these niggas (en garde)

F: You know what it is, you see me! Funk Flex, you see what– we make it happen! Download that DJ Funk Flex app right now! You see me with the a.k.a Young Chocolate, ladies, you see me! My ma– my man Action Bronson is here, baby!
A: Uh! Young renegade, yo, Body, what up, Body?
B: I'm out here, man, take 'em back! '99, I got it shakin' in front of Skate Key, you wasn't wit' me!
A: Uh! You know what I'm sayin'?
B: 

[?], man. We out here, shout-outs to 

[?], Fordham Road, we out here wildin'!
A: Yo, yo, I got this, baby. I got this

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Yo, spent your advance on one trip to Six Flags
With a handicapped class with your candy rap ass
Bitch, you singin' like Frankie Lymon
Fuck around, you might break your hymen
Then somebody's gonna have to clean the mess up
Like you fuckin' spilled ketchup
Fuckin' flawless from the neck up
If you want it, better step up
You don't wanna feel that brat-tat-tat-tat
Come through the fuckin' ball court with Salt-N-Pepa
Hold on, hold the fuck on, yo

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Yo, yo, yo, listen, yo, yo
If I die, change my suit four times at the wake
Make sure I get my dick sucked also
Uh, everybody wearin' white clothes
Crush cocaine, put it up your right nose
You might see me lookin' homeless
Hoppin' out the rover, parrot on my shoulder
Just say, "What up," I might acknowledge you
My shit is crazy, though appear to be a common dude
I only deal with people that invent shit
'Cause after rap there ain't no pension
And I'm just tryin' to be the next George Foreman
Inventin' new grills so Jadakiss could cook the base on it
I might take a shit in some expensive jeans
I got expensive habits
My kids are mixed like Lenny Kravitz
It's not me rappin', it's the parrot
And if I punch you in the face
You'll never eat a motherfuckin' sandwich!
Body!

[Interlude: Action Bronson, Big Body Bes and Funkmaster Flex]
B: Oh my God!
A: Queens in the motherfuckin' building, man! Flex, you hear me, man?
F: I hear you!
A: Yo, shout-outs to my brother Alchemist, man! Yo, Body, tell 'em somethin', son! Uh!
B: I cry– I can't eve– I feel like speaking Puerto Rican, right now
A: Yo, I got this, son. I got this. I got this. Yo, yo

[Verse 3: Action Bronson]
These dudes wanna claim king, you're dealing with immortals
Fuck being cordial, I'm laughin' while I'm dancin' in the ball room
Former king's head lay in the guillotine
Snap my fingers, chop that motherfucker for the village to see
Ain't no man walking iller than me
If you see me, better kneel on the knee
I'm like a one-in-a-million case
Brilliant face, crooked J tryna put me in the cage
Turn the page, bitch, I'm paid
I been around the world more than Carmen Sandiego
Raw meat thrown to lions under the table
Grown men breakin' bread while your face bled
Found him face down in the shed like a base head
Switch plates on the Civic, pivot
Exotic places that they rap about, I live it
Fat boy, I'm eatin' all the spinach
Hold up a second, baby, I ain't even finished, nah
I dropped 50 grand on my man's bail
Two hours later, he was tan as a potato
From a foreign land that once was occupied by NATO
Every line is nasal
We deal with more numbers than times tables
Bodies get found in the ground by neighbors
I'm in the bathroom reading the paper, laid up
Sharp blade cut, need a top, girly-girlies like it
The ones that go two ways, it's just my blue phase
Shit, dawg, yo
I'm in the bathroom reading the paper, laid up
Butt-naked in the Lamborghini
These motherfuckers can't see me
The Magic Johnson of the game, these lames don't want to play with me
You hear me?
Queens in the motherfuckin' building!

[Outro: Funkmaster Flex, Action Bronson and Big Body Bes]
F: New York City, listen, man. I'ma– I'ma keep it– I'ma keep it official today. Yo, this boy Action Bronson is the nicest in the game right now, bruh
A: Uh!
F: We gon' keep it official. This is a mean freestyle
B: You hear that?
A: Uh!
F: He's the nicest in the game, we gon' keep it official
A: QU!
F: Yo, listen, you're more than welcome to disagree, I don't think many people gon' disagree
A: Shout-outs to Body
F: Mean
A: Shout-outs to Alchemist, Meyhem Lauren, Jay Steel, we the fuck out here
Sometimes I really don't wanna have to speak my mind
Cause I really don't wanna tell you how I
Am digging you so
I can't let go
But it hurts me to my soul
To tell you every little thing that is on my mind
I can't let you know so I hide it inside
All my feelings for you
Don't want you to
Let it go to your head

I'm mean to you sometimes
But I can't get you off my mind
So I hit you with the game
Always tryna act like your lovin doesn't phase me
When the truth is that it amaze me
You know it's a big lie
Cause you can see right through my eyes
How much I wanna hold you
Give you all my love and baby boy
Let me show you
And I really wanna get to know you

[Chorus]

But I've been there
And I've done that
And I've promised never to get hurt again, never again
You drive me crazy but I promised myself
Never to get hurt again, never again


I can't never ever let you see me this way
So I take all my feelings
And I tuck em away
Fronting like I don't want you to hold me tight
So I act like I'm putting up a fight
To get your attention
And make you stay around longer
So I tell you I don't like it
Cause I know that that will make you wanna hold me tighter
I can't help myself I really like ya

[Chorus]2x

I don't deserve it
I can never get hurt again never get hurt again
Never never
I don't deserve it I could never get hurt again
Never get hurt again
Never, oooo

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Uhh

[Chorus]
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

[Verse 1]
Find out where your parents stay
Tell my goons to go straight to your momma room
What's in your pockets? What's in your pocketbook?
We think the Bible's a comic book
Bitch this Hollygrove, too far from Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
I got cocaine that's so good, need a name? Call it "Milk"
Because milk does the body good
I got this heat on my waist
So somebody better monitor the thermometer
I just eat pussy and pussy-ass niggas all day
And I ain't even kinda full

[Chorus]
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

[Verse 2]
Woo! I went from Bourbon to Beverly Hills
Show me your tits
I'll show you my weapon and grill and heaven is real
I get an actress into my bedroom
She lay down and say, "Let's make a film"
I be like, "Action," I hold her head down by her neck
This how breathtaking feel
Family first, you'll get your family killed, that's if you squeal
Pop-pop, close range, hold that gun
Like the photographer hold the camera still
Bad bitch riding my dick
She swerve 'cause another bitch grabbing the wheel
I ask 'em to chill, they both look at me, say "Shut up"
I say "My lips are sealed..."
Oooh! I come from Hollygrove, I done went Hollywood
I was a match made in Heaven
When Hell was a pile of wood
I run through Hell with gasoline drawers on
Stop, tell the Devil that God is good
Entrepreneur in a Bentley droptop Azure
Vagina connoisseur out the hood
I come from Hollygrove, every day Halloween
We shoot your block up and just say we shot a scene
This is a robbery, I let the chopper squeeze
Turn you to cottage cheese
Been on my beast since I was wearing Wallabees
Where paparazzi? I need my privacy
Fuck your photography, I react violently
Make sure your camera get my good side of me, Lord!
I come from Hollygrove
Hollywood should make a movie 'bout Hollygrove
Woo! Whoever play me
Should get a Oscar and a Golden Globe
This ain’t no movie, this is real shit
I don’t need a script 'cause I know my role
My Hollywood bitch just overdosed
All she could snort, more coke than Pinocchio
I come from the streets
But got "superstar" written all over my face
That's why these hoes in my face
I come from Hollygrove
I moved to Hollywood just to Californicate
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop
I ain't finished shooting, tell 'em don't check the gate

[Chorus]
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Fall asleep to the gunshots
Wake up and smell the embalming fluid
I come from Hollygrove, my bitch from Hollywood
When I fuck her she say "Hallelujah!"
Hollygrove too far from Hollywood
Ohh, but I done went Hollywood

[Verse 3]
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Hollygrove ain't far from H-Town
We used to drive back and forth with the work praying
"Lord please don’t let this car break down"
Hahahaha
H-Town! Lord, I done went from Hollygrove to H-Town
Hollygrove to Houston
Got a bad 5th Ward bitch that be boostin'
Sometimes she doze off, that’s the lean, I excuse it
She said "If it ain't ch-chopped and screwed, it ain't music"
She say I never take her out, we went to eat at Houston's
Sometimes I doze off, that's the lean, I'm just snoozin'
I still got Actavis, nigga, that's exclusive
Kill you for a pint, that's a PT Cruiser
I see way too many hoes in my future
I'm gon' nail all them hoes, I'm Freddy Krueger
Grew up on Bun B, Pimp C was my tutor
Pimp Squad for life, had to do this for Houston
Hollygrove ain't far from H-town
We used to drive back and forth with the work
Praying the car don’t break down
Ohhh, Hollygrove ain’t far from H-town
We used to drive back and forth
With, codeine, cocaine, the pills, and pounds
Yeah, and we got back home safe and sound
If you got pulled over you don't give police no names
Or get killed and never found
Word, but I kept some money to bail out
Momma used to say if I ever get caught
They gon' put me under the jailhouse
Damn, I'm too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
One to the chest with this chopper
Leave you with just arms and a head like a octopus
I got this chopper protecting my livelihood
I'm so good, I'm so straight, I'm secure

[Chorus]
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

[Outro]

[Intro: Ludacris]
Yeah
Ha, new year, new album coming soon, yes
I got a lot more shit to say man...

[Verse: Ludacris]
Reviews is out and Burning Bridges EP got 'em  5 stars
So wake up if you sleepin', Luda got them 5 bars
Every week you ain't never seen a nigga drivin' less than 5 cars
Got money about of this world, bitch I'm tryna buy Mars
I told NASA build a spaceship and just fill that shit with cake
Pop that pussy on a hand stand but droppin' it out of space
Strippers floatin' on the ceiling, they don't even need a pole
Got 'em high up off that white, and I ain't even need a stove
I'm cooking heat for the 2015 and got that new album seekin' (Ludaversal!)
Pictures of me and my wife just got that internet geekin'
I ain't reachin', I'm just tryna tell you niggas how it goes
Welcome to my life as I explain it through my flows, here we go
I started out at 16 gettin' paper, Made myself made millionnaire
I ain't never gave a fuck about a hater
They sayin' Why is Luda always talking about his duckings? 

[?]
'Cuz rappers tend to forget and I gotta remind these motherfuckas
I'm a Boss, I'm a floss, I'm a talk about it every chance I get
Top 5, dead or alive I'm a show you niggas every time I spit
Y'all ain't never seen top flight nigga like me
I be on my jet in a three piece suit, no mo long white Tee's
I'm a hustler, I'm a true definition of a G
When you children grow up, then gon' be like me
So I'm livin' everyday and try to set the best example
And everyone of your favorite rapper's fuckin' head is on my mantle bitch, Biaatch !
Nicole,
Hopefully you doing well and you realized you need to quit fuckin' wit Sedale and come home to your Doctor. I will take care of you baby girl.

I'm in Nevada with Hype lookin' at spots for this new video we are shooting for that single I told you Pac is going to be on once he is out, called California Love. We met a bunch of crazy, naked motherfuckers in the desert today, they were putting up some type of giant wood man. I guess they have a big party out here for a bunch of days. I asked them how much they pay, they said "nothing", I was like no money? Someone should get behind fools cause they said there will be at least be 5,000 people. I think I will have my office look into it, just to see if there is easy money to be had here. I'm 'bout to pass out girl, wish I was up in that ass. See you back in L.A.

Dre

[Chorus]
She was a friend of Thugger, now she a friend of Scotty

I'ma do my best
Like the fifth-grade test, gotta make it to the six
My bro gon' buy me that new 'Vette, no Michael Vick
But these bitches want a dog like Lil Tic
No homo, but my blunt look like a dick
Punchanella, punchanella, I'ma make it rain
Bring your umbrella, check the schedule
I can lick your ear soft as a feather, hello
How ya doin'? This for my neighbor (Who?), Carmelo
Brainwash, brainwash, little buddy got me brainwashed
I can't think twice, I want her some more
I want her remorse, I want her remorse (Hey)

[Chorus]
She was a friend of Thugger, now she a friend of Scotty

[Verse 2]
I got three best friends, they tell me about all of my hoes
You wanna bool with me? Couldn't give him 500 to wear my clothes
We build our unity, I got them young nats calling me early like on truancy
They wanna get with me, make a flick with me
Thugger Thugger, baby, take her to Italy
I'm too up, I get the birds for like ten-a-piece
And therefore, I'm on the road, I know she missing me
But I'ma leave early to take her ass to Tiffany's
Birds fly high, but you fly higher
You got a man, and I don't want to, but I got to despise you
For dinner time, come here, come here, woah, woah (Hey)

[Chorus]
She was a friend of Thugger, now she a friend of Scotty
She was a friend of Thugger, now she a friend of Scotty
Baby, I want your pizza, I want all the toppings

From the floating death, to the fire of death
To a flower outside my grave
An old man
Or were you just being polite with your hands?

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Take time to learn me like court-appointed attorneys
Restore the order, we either join or adjourning
Less you join, I'm up performing the journey
In all earnest, I go so Bernie
Takes another nigga to turn me
Get it straight, I ain't late on states
I'm just sternly stating
How what I do, with grace takes another nigga to turn mean
My returning's like Blockbuster with a tape
And I ain't kind but I don't hit
So you starting at the end, that's the part where you begin
I skip the bullshit so we can start it where we win
Yeah, spoiler alert
I can hear you all saying, "Boy, you're a jerk"
But it's cool though, know we gotta rule yo
Get it in, then we win and do it all again, ho

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
From the floating death, to the fire of death
To a flower outside of my grave
An old man
Or were you just being polite with your hands?
And it really means I'm number one, and you're a fan
Well that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
Yeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
Yeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Now me and words, we made a deal, that I'm gon' keep 'em real
And they show me their secrets, I can even cop a feel
Victorious
Can't match wit, with warriors
I match wig with wits
Similarly can't mix matchsticks with forests
Only you can prevent what I do
Only dew can prevent what's my view
I match matchsticks with wicks
Wicker man, take a sip of liquor and
Spit the lip off warriors
And spit flames, nigga, get in the gang, ahh

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
From the floating death, to the fire of death
To a flower outside of my grave
An old man
Or were you just being polite with your hands?
And it really means I'm number one, and you're a fan
Well that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
Yeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one too, yeah
Well that's for me, heh, yeah I think you're number one too

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
It's road rage, without a roll cage
Takes courage to run on these roadways
I know you like "No way" but I'm a full race
All so every soccer Terry Fox molding
Go ahead
Don't stop, go ahead
Sitting in your car, just listening to the bars
And there's traffic all around and you feel like falling down
And the music that I'm spewing out, enough to calm it down
'Fore you know you're out your car with your briefcase walkin' round
And them dollars from the budget that went to S1 Production
And Sebastian on the hook like being dug by Michael Douglas (yeah!)
So don't start that walk through Echo Park
When life's a one-on-one and you caught up in the jam
Just show some love back to your number one fan

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
From the floating death, to the fire of death
To a flower outside of my grave
An old man
Or were you just being polite with your hands?
And it really means I'm number one, and you're a fan
Well that's cool, cause I think you're number one too
Yeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one too, yeah
Well that's for me, heh, cause I think you're number one too

[Outro: Guy Sebastian]
Yeah I think you're number one too

[Pre-Chorus: Troi]
Closet full of bones, just don't try to put 'em back together
(Try to put 'em back together)
They know just by my tone so wear it like a scarlet letter
(Wear it like a scarlet letter)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
(I've always loved you)
Uhh, quiet in the court for the courtship
Marriage of the dork and the gorgeous
Took her from the king of the corpses
He revolved, jumped the wall of the fort with the horses
This was foretold, Bojangles was tappin' in Morse code
At least to the mad man genius, tap top secrets and more gold
(All of you)
From the guts of the mother
Campbell should move her undercover
With a $3,000 son she just want a lover
And somebody else to come and try and drug her
Take her off the grill, she done
(they will never love you)
Pills celebrating, "We won"
In the system of the women, never knew he had it in him
This condition when the world that they make him become
(None of you)
Cocaine and new high tech ways, smuggle whole things
(I've always loved you)
From the control range that make radio heads with gold brains
(All of you)
To park 84' Jags on gold chains
Developing nicks from a whole name
God is great, but it's snakes on my soul plane

[Pre-Chorus]
Closet full of bones, just don't try to put 'em back together
(Try to put 'em back together)
They know just by my tone so wear it like a scarlet letter
(Wear it like a scarlet letter)

[Chorus: Troi]
Anatomy (skin) will be the death of me
Anatomy (skin) that's just my anatomy
Anatomy (skin) will be the death of me
Anatomy (skin)

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
(Tell me what to do)
Limo to the limit, fill it 'til the brim get in it
You can't get it, if you gotta ask
(Make me pretty) In that case I want two masks
Bottom class, dollar cast, poppin' tags, droppin' trash
In shopping bags 'til Akeem take our pocket cash
(Am I beautiful?)
Write it in lights, molly in the body of Christ
Drop me to the lobby from heights (trust me)
Then over the threshold to redeem the doorway
Fourteen broads like the king of Norway
Fourteen broads having dreams of foreplay
Fourteen arm Shiva, viva la coup!
(Love you) If the government get it, I'm a fool

[Pre-Chorus]
Closet full of bones, just don't try to put 'em back together
(Try to put 'em back together)
They know just by my tone so wear it like a scarlet letter
(Wear it like a scarlet letter)

[Chorus]
Anatomy (skin) will be the death of me
Anatomy (skin) that's just my anatomy
Anatomy (skin) will be the death of me
Anatomy (skin)

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Sanskrit dance on the page of the dead book
Don't leave the restroom with the left foot
Flags of Tibet, to bet, to bed, to death, flesh
Release the leash on a fast car
Feed on the keys, fall asleep in a Jaguar
The tip of thy sword is white
Am I night, am I black, am I light?
Have I been this?
Realize my begin when I find where my end this
Oedipus wrecks, motherfucker this better than sex
Material potion the love of my martyr
Currency soaked in the blood of my father
(Will you cry for me?)
Sky burial, let the wind carry you, farther
Than I could (live forever)
An anatomy, not of me, knotting me to it, nodding me to it
Eyes of the I and others, watching me do it
Adapt in each rubric
Kubrick in plot and tone
Lots of bones, skulls to the top of tone
Skim through it is just skin to it
You're so thin you see the sins through it

[Pre-Chorus]
Closet full of bones, just don't try to put 'em back together
(Try to put 'em back together)
They know just by my tone so wear it like a scarlet letter
(Wear it like a scarlet letter)

[Chorus]
Anatomy (skin) will be the death of me
Anatomy (skin) that's just my anatomy
Anatomy (skin) will be the death of me
Anatomy (skin)

[Saxophone Solo: Terrace Martin]

[Verse 1]
When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn
What you think you know
There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

[Chorus]
But at your best, you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
If you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Love

[Verse 2]
When you feel what you feel
It's hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But if you feel more like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about, all about

[Chorus]
But at your best, you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Love

[Bridge]
(Wait, waiting)
Let me know
You niggas goin' in
Tell me what it is (Fuck it)
What it is, no need to make believe
Look beyond your world
Try to find, find a place for me

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're at your best, you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, know
Love

[Outro]
Stay at your best, baby
Let me know, let me know

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Now bring it out like a finger in the back of your mouth
Cherubs and cerebellum
Terror at Sarah's wedding, Sam marrying Sam
Band pushed upon the finger of Sam's hairiest hand (OOOH!)
If that sickens you, you a bigot
If it doesn't, well then you're wicked
Such is life, odd as Egg McMuffins at night
No answers, so let us watch these dancers
Structure reformed gracefully being born
On the pallet of dark grays, concaves and spirals
Kaleidoscope into a Eiffel
It ripples then it tidals, vacillates then it virals
Babylons then it Bibles and others
And tell me of the spinning mothers
And today's mathematics for beloved
And beasts' bellies covered like the cummerbunds of butlers

[Chorus: Nikki Jean]
How was your day?
Can I make what you say what I wanna hear?
Cause I want you here
The hell that we raised
To the heavens do anything for
La petite mort, la petite mort

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
They keep the bottles just to make glass houses
Then climb up to the second floors and throw rocks out it
Then expect not a volley in reply
Some place vulnerable like probably in the eye
What of the chicken? What is it missin'? Is it dry?
Did it die in some inhumane conditions so it didn't go relaxed
And the tension from its demise
Pulled all of the flavor from the fat and made it flat
And rather lifeless, well there's a place
That has a stunning turbot and more mercifully murdered Pisces
But barbaric are still the prices
It's rather niceless, apricot in dices and fromage slices
My son will call risotto rices
If and when he's left to his own devices, well
How is your memory? Is it returning like a lemon tree
To bear bitter fruit of what you meant to me?
Or was it slippin' like permission? Am I trippin' like field
I feel I'm grippin' but maybe the transmission
Still left out the life, also left out the will, grief
Will cheese never touch your teeth
Maybe like kosher beef
Is it real? Is it real? Is it real? Ha, hah!

[Chorus: Nikki Jean]
Howl at the day
Can I make you my prey?
Cause I want you dear, ooh, I want you dear
The hell that we raised
To the heavens make symmetries for
Our petite mort, our petite mort

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
So glad you're back
But not glad at that you're glatt
Where is the glamour in collapse?
Where in the shatter of the facts shoves one back to a pattern of stab wounds?
Swoon ridden goons consumed and driven mad soon
The atelier slowly fills with baboons
And other monkey business
Where killers go free cause the junkie's a funky witness
Runny mascaras from the cunning mask wearers of death
Bygone errors, sittin' like two oil derricks
Separated by a sea of cooling num nums
Reminiscing of an every day playing hum drum
Where recognition went unnoticed
And then solidified till it was stoic
We should've been poets
Somewhere between amateurs and grandmasters of iambic pentameter

[Chorus: Nikki Jean]
How are your chains?
Do they make you behave?
Keep you over here, by your overseer
Fallen from grace
Down from Heaven to memories' floor
La petite mort, la petite mort

[Produced by Simon Sayz]

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
It’s for the love
Cause we love you so much
Keep it real
I don’t feel what you feel though
You don’t feel what I feel so
It all started out

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
See first I had patience, and a nigga had energy
But now I'm weak, definitely
Pedi to the pedal, you finna speed
You remind me of, of my Jeep
But off in the future, and what it’s finna be
All your memories can become enemies
So let’s intercede I know you in the seat
But let’s get outta that, before it’s injuries

[Chorus: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]
At first I had patience
But then that patience turned to waiting
And then that waitin’ turned to wasting my time, my time, my time
And then that wasting turned to hating
And then that hating got to racing
All around my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
So before we hit a wall, heartbreak, and it crashes
Just walk away, no scratches (No scratches)
See first they had patience

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
But niggas start getting sick, niggas start getting ill
Niggas got cold feet, niggas start getting chills
Niggas start staying home cause niggas start getting bills
Building up an immunity, niggas stopped getting hurt
Niggas relied on faith
Hopin’ niggas get healed, it's hopeless nigga, get real
But ah, get back on the pill
We in it for the feel, but even winners turn sinners

[Chorus: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]
Patience
But then that patience turned to waiting
And then that waitin’ turned to wasting your time, your time, your time
And then that wasting turned to hating
And then that hating got to racing
All inside your mind, your mind, your mind, your mind
So before we hit a wall, heartbreak, and it crashes
Just walk away, no scratches (no stratches)
So before we hit a wall, heartbreak, and it crashes
Just walk away, no scratches (no scratches)
First we had patience

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Mini bar raided, in the Indy car faded
500 miles, it’s pretty far, ain't it?
But it’s a pretty car, ain't it?
Pretty hard painted (but pretty darn dangerous)
But we ain't get the memo
Hangin’ out the window, they don’t care no more
Tryna take this mini to a limo...
Without a helmet then you can Thelma it
Louis, Louise, but we on the same thing
So I be James Dean
So your wreck and my wreck look like the same scene

[Chorus: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]
So before we hit a wall, heartbreak, and it crashes
Just walk away, no scratches (no scratches)
First we had patience

[Hook]
She live in Fort Lauderdale
And I'm closer to South Beach
I told her to come over
She said "OK, don't fall asleep"
She say she can be my housewife
And keep my house clean
I say "Shut the fuck up
Put this dick back in your mouth please"
I don’t see nothing wrong with
Some mouth and lip service
Tunechi in this bitch
I'm tighter than a pinched nerve, bitch
I didn't answer my phone
I said I couldn't get service
My new Nina just told me
That she sick of being a virgin

[Verse 1]
Bagging up the work
For a hour, fingers hurtin'
Let my bitches help
Before they leave I check their purses
Sorry for the wait
The confusion, the disturbance
Got me movin' weight
Prostitution, and these verses
Whippin' in the kitchen
In the trap house with my shirt off
I'ma get these millions
And I put that on my first born
Got that old Juvie bumpin'
Talkin' bout the third ward
The D.A. was a dick
And the Judge was a jerkoff
Got a bad bitch
Body curvy like a curveball
Let her drink too much
Now her pussy taste like Smirnoff
Sleepin' on chinchilla
Boy I'm cozy like a furball
Fuck the other side
Nigga we could have a turf war
Sorry for the wait
Had to drop this part two and shit
Just to let you know
That a nigga still doin' it
Workin' like a slave
On my Roots Part Two shit
Got to let 'em know
That Lil Tunechi still Tunechi, bitch
Bop-bop-bop!
Fuck with me wrong get that hammer
Thank God I'm home from the slammer
Was gone for that hammer
Stompin' the yard like a gamma
Niggas was goin' bananas
I'm calm like a camel
I'm smokin' that strong like a Camel
I bet my life when we gamble
Y'all shippin' keys, we shippin' grand pianos
I'm in that Lam Diablo
Pew, like ammo
I'm gone
Two fingers up, bitch, I'm gone
Rich forever – Jerry Jones
I gotta hustle, keepin' my destiny goin'
Like the House of Deréon
This plane that I'm on
Is private, my very own
So no checkin' my carry-ons
She sent a picture naked, I said "It's on"

[Hook]
But she live in Fort Lauderdale
And I'm closer to South Beach
I told her to come over
She said "OK, don't fall asleep"
She say she can be my housewife
And keep my house clean
I say shut the fuck up
Put this dick back in your mouth please
I don’t see nothing wrong with
Some mouth and lip service
Tunechi motherfucker
Tighter than a pinched nerve, bitch
I didn't answer my phone
Said I couldn't get service
My new Nina just told me
That she sick of being a virgin

[Verse 2]
Now I don't get excited
Nigga, I just get exotic
I don't get invited
To these bitches pity parties
I don't do narcotic
Even though a nigga got it
Countin' all this money
I feel like I got arthritis
Baggin' up the work
For a hour, fingers hurtin'
Let my bitches help
Before they leave I check their purses
Sorry for the wait
The confusion, the disturbance
Boy we movin' weight
Prostitution, and these verses
Whippin' in the kitchen
In the trap house with my shirt off
I'm gon' get these millions
And I put that on my first born
Got that old Juvie bumpin'
Talking 'bout the third ward
The DA was a dick
And the Judge was a jerk off

[Outro]
We yellin'
Suwoop, suwoop, suwoop
Yeah, you hear us yellin'
Suwoop, suwoop, suwoop
Blood gang, nigga
And it's that Sorry 4 the Wait 2, woo
And I'm so sorry for the wait too, yea
Sorry for the wait
Had to drop that part two and shit
Just to let you know
That a nigga still doin' it
Workin' like a slave
Talking Roots part two and shit
Sorry for the wait
Lil Tunechi still Tunechi bitch

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I'm in the collard green 6, cornbread in the guts
Got the Halloween kicks trick or treating the clutch
Come on nigga, is you tricking or what?
Flow tighter than a dick in the butt
Just hopped off the plane, came back from Vancouv'
Little white tee, some boobs and bamboo
White girls tell me, "Hey, Nicki, your camp rules
Is that why you get more head than shampoos?"
Asalaamalaikum, no oink for me
And I never let a D-boy boink for free
Cause it's barbie bitch, you can join the wave
I done penny, nickel, dimed, I done coined the phrase
You couldn't beat me there if you had a Leer
Indian-style court side with a cavalier
VIP Roseau's you can have a beer
Cause honey when you getting money you don't have a care

Now Roger that, Rroger that. Roger that, Rroger that
Roger that, Roger that...Roger

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Young black Rico's
Kill for the C notes
But me though
I jack son bitch Tito
She wanna play games
But this is not bingo
Monopoly I'm past "GO"
Gon' ahead and deep-throat
4-chick Foursomes
Skin colors mocha
Sally and Sonia put the pussies on my Totem
Pole
Watt stroke 'em
Strike it like bowling
Now open like you yawnin'
It's 6 in the morning
Sleeping on me probably in a coffin
I'm hotter than the end of fuckin' August
I'm awesome
I'm awesome. Repeat it to your Grandma and Uncles, my Mothers
Tyga's no Dad but I'm the motherfucker
My fuckers
This the last supper
Look, no hands
I'm a bread cuffer
I don't dare lover
I'm a dare devil
I don't fear nothin'
Motherfucker
Young money!
Now roger that. Roger that. Roger that. Roger that. Fuck around and never get Roger back

[Verse 3: Wayne]
(I'm goin' in!)
Fresh off the jet, sharper than Gillette
The blunt still wet, so pass it like brat
We sip side a mug, we call it upset
Smoke more than 4 quarters, we call it sudden debt
I'm a beast
You a pet
AK long neck
Keith Sweat
Weezy, motherfucker
Capo in this bitch with me
Money talks and have a convo in this bitch with me
I'm mountain high Colorado in this bitch with me
Flow crazy, 730, you just 650
20 bullets from the Chopper take the roof off
Laughing to the bank
I'm a goof ball
It's YM
And we at yo neck like a Violin
It's our world
We make it spin
And y'all the prey. Amen
Now roger that. Roger that. Where Roger at? I heard Rog' a Rat
Fuck around and never get Roger back

[Intro]
Yeah

He's on that moonrock
Shit be gettin' all in your mouth – pause
Nigga!

Racing Ferraris with lil Reginae
That's gangsta
You know I always come in second place
You hatin'
It's written all over your fuckin' –

[Hook]
Bitch, you jealous
Woo
And I was right, yeah, haha
Bitch, you jealous
Stuntin' on niggas
Stunt, stunt – The shit niggas don't like
Tell a fuck nigga – "Bitch, you jealous"
I'm Sorry 4 The Wait, apologetic
Bitch you jealous
Now give us our cash and our credit

[Interlude]
Pop! Hah
Sorry for the –

[Verse]
Riding 'round like Pablo
Still talking that blanco
My Nina sing soprano
So we gon' leave on a high note
Come out my shell like Rafael
And crack yours like a taco
Lil Wayne tougher than John Wayne
Make him change his name to John Doe
It's me and my lil brother Capo
Lil Marly G and my bottom bitch
If I'm falling, it's bottomless
If I'm tripping, it's a power trip
Her pearl tongue like the pearly gates
And with that said, I climb the fence
My other bitches gotta ride the bench
And with that said... bitch you jealous
I'm fly like my dreadlocks propellers
I think I should headline Coachella
My woman a Queen like Coretta
And nigga you sleep with the Devil
I couldn't be Junior forever
I don't mean to ruffle your feathers
But I had to spread my wings
Ain't trying to get lemon-peppered
Got too many pistols, too many issues
Too many mistakes, too many miscues
Only made me better, it turned me into
The man I am today, I'm new and I'm improved
I got my shit right, it's just you and a tissue
Suit yourself because this suit is a rental
Now the snow is just coming in
Like I broke a window to an igloo
Slow a bitch down like "Un momento"
I'd rather get screwed than scrutinized
I'd rather get used by a cutie pie
If she ain't fucking it's Uber time
I'd rather be advised than supervised
You do the math, we do the numbers
We pour champagne and expensive wine
In water guns and shoot each other
I get high, meditate like a monk
Preposterous when I get drunk
And my goons is wilder than Gronk
My do's is as bad as my don'ts
Met a kinda-cute bitch with a donk
As long as the bitch got a donk
And I smell like; pussy, money, and weed
She say "Ooh, I like your cologne"
The last niggas tested us flunk
So please study hard, study long
Kill your wife, then take the bitch phone
And text you to please hurry home
And the rain drops turn into blood
Look like you just come in from a storm
And if all pussies come with walls
I hope you run into your own
Nigga
I come with that heroin flow
I come with that never before
My CMB days are dead
I ain't worried 'bout ghost
I married the MOB, we divorced
Hoo, and all that shit dead without me of course
It's nothing; a zombie, a corpse
You burnt yourself and was supposed to pass me the torch
Fuck it, I'll see you in Forbes, nigga
I'm sorry for the fucking wait
Was busy, searching my calendar for better days
I found 'em, you either turn the page or tear the page
Y. M., Young Money; never age

[Hook]
Bitch, you jealous, woo
And I was right, yeah
Tell a fuck nigga "Bitch, you jealous"
Stuntin' on niggas
Stunt, stunt; the shit niggas don't like, yeah
Bitch you jealous
I'm sorry for the wait, apologetic, hey
Bitch you jealous
Now give us our cash and our credit, hey

[Outro]
Pop!

Remergence (19:11 - 23:44)

[Hook x2]
I'ma spit that shit
Show these niggas how dark this shit get
Cause I'ma spit that shit
Show these niggas how dark this shit get

[Verse 1]
Shit pop off, we don't blow it up 'til we blow it up
Cats better slow it up, y'all niggas know what's up
My niggas throw it up; we all know that
In fact, niggas missing the action, where are they at?
See, you niggas never really been ducked out
But got enough mouth to get snuffed out; roof the rough route
We don't play around here, nigga, we're grown
Start applying pressure, give the dog a bone
I'm taking half; it's just that simple
Or I can start popping niggas like pimples
I'ma let you call it, you ballin'
'Til you get hit with them hot things, now you're staggering and fallin'
I'm holding up the wall, you got more than enough problems in the floor
You're just wasting a nigga's time; come on, man
I got shit to do, like hit your crew
Might hit your crib, so what that bitch gon' do
Not a damn thing, but dawg's with the program
Beast on that bitch like Conan, whoa man
I'ma go where no man has ever gone
Nigga, when it's on, it's on, I'll let you know when the fuck it's on
I got nothing to hide, but you got a reason to run
Come through like BRRAT, to the squeeze of the gun
And that's just squeezing one, imagine if we all let go
And turn your whole block into a death row

[Hook x2]

Between me and you, I'd be in the dark for too long
Bark is too strong, hot light is on
Whatever it's gon' be, that's what it is
I didn't stutter, motherfucka, put that on your kids
Built for war, built for raw
Built for more, built from it all for the dog to the floor
I've been getting down before I knew what getting down was
Shit, I just do what a real nigga does
Get anything straight up
If shit starts falling apart, wait up, let's get this rent paid up
So it's square one, and a nigga can't get a fair one at
Any time of the day, but a nigga can run
Keep shit moving, doing what the fuck we be doin'
They're coming to 'em, but I'm running through 'em
I don't need the headache, I've never been talking to death
But I'll fuck you to death; what the fuck you left?
I don't want nothing, but some fucking pussy
I ain't trying to be all cuddled up, 

[?] talking getting mushy
Been there, done that, with that one back there
From when there was none of that to when there was some of that
Niggas still come back, hood for life
Shit, quiet as a cat nigga, where's my wife?

[?] for the night, that's what it be
Or if its good for tomorrow cause tomorrow well see
Take it one day at a time, my end's in the street
Don't fear my feast, your man's in the heat
That's how the dog gets down on all fours
After a certain hour, I'm knocking on all doors
Anything goes when it's on, motherfucka
Whether you're friend or foe, you gon' lend some dough
And in case you don't know, that nigga don't owe
Whatever I come up on, let that shit go
Faggot

[Hook x2]

[Verse 1]
I might get ugly, if nobody loves me anymore
I might keep it simple, to find out what you're here for
Just let me know
I know I'm quiet, I don't bother every time
You leave me crying, out to the sky
You can tell me why
Love could be alive, if your love is not a lie, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
But you can't make me hush
Make me hush
You know I'm all about the rush

[Chorus]
No one's gonna save you from yourself
And I hope that you feel better, better
I hope that you feel good
And no one's gonna want you if you cry for help
And I'm there now, I care now, I'm there now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, hush

[Verse 2]
If you can trust me, you just might be lucky in a thousand ways
Nigga, wassup, wassup? You fucked up
I don't hate, I just tough love, tough love
You think that you know, but you're out of control
I'm the ticking bomb and the detonator froze
And now you're exposed, exposed
Explode, explode, explode, explode

[Chorus]
No one's gonna save you from yourself
And I hope that you feel better, better, better
And no one's gonna want you if you cry for help
And I'm there now, I'm there now, I'm there now (Oh)
No one's gonna save you from yourself
And I hope that you feel better, better, better (Yeah, oh)
And no one's gonna want you if you cry for help
(Save you from yourself)
And I'm there now, I'm there now, I'm there now, oh

[Outro]
No, ah, ooh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Girl
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours

[Verse 1]
Passion burning, causing rapture of laughter
Pressure building, falling faster and faster
If I told you that you rock my world, I want you around me
Would you let me call you my girl, my girlfriend, my girlfriend?
I can give you the life you deserve, just say the word, baby
And I got you, darling, I got you

[Chorus]
Girl
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours

[Verse 2]
Chapters turning, so old fashioned and natural
Potions got me falling for you, oh yeah
Baby if I told you that you rock my world, I want you around me
Would you let me call you my girl, my girlfriend, my girlfriend?
I can give you the life you deserve, just say the word
And I got and more

[Chorus]
Girl (you're mine)
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours
Girl
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours
Girl
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours
Girl
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours

[Part 2]

[Intro]
Baby
Baby

[Verse]
Baby, baby, love me, save me
Keep me wrapped up in your open arms
Come on, baby, gave me, something amazing
But don't mistake me for someone, for the next girl, nah
We don't fight, we just fuck
I'm in like, she's in love
She gave in, I gave up
Can we just live in the moment?

[Hook:]
Don't bother me
I'm workin'
Don't bother me
I'm workin'
Don't bother me
I'm workin'
Don't bother me

[Verse 1:]
P.O Nigga
So I pour on bitches
Made me the shit
Who is you kiddin'
Funny to a nigga how I fucked your misses
Whoa kemosabe words be my hobby
Blonde in my dreads
And I shake it like I'm Marley
Give me that funk that gushy stuff
Baby don't be flattered only in a rush
Pop pop pop
When I wanna' knock knock
If them niggas cock block
Then they probably won't stop
Give 'em leash
Let them have a chance
Pussy probably only be as whole like plan
Who you know got my ideas
What if Cam'Ron had a baby with

And I'm so so stern
Like my name is Howard
See I didn't catch that how awkward
Rock all black like my dad 

[?]
Say I'm so childish
Name ain't Bino
Kappa bitches always on the rock
Rock chinos
Every Sunday  lattes and cappuccinos
Who you know rap like this
They say I invented records and the team so 

[?]
If them niggas hate I consider them kids
Cause them real niggas don't give a fuck about shit
Explicit mommy forgive me
This is how I act when I feel a little tipsy
Bad boy but I don't know Diddy
I showed the fuck Janet Jackson's titties
(Hol up)
She wanna wine and dine
Love is just a word and I hear it all the time
How you let four letters 

[?] your life
Pick up the tab maybe get you a dime
Mulah be the ruler these days
And hoes break a neck when they see the bentley
Bank account drop you ain't even got 2k
But homie at the crib always playing 2k
Nigga don't bother me
I'm workin'

[?]

[Verse 2:]
Rap till I d-i-e
Fuck a truce nigga that's a l-i-e
Frontin' like you don't know me
When you always retweet on the n-e-t
Baby I'mma B-r-b
That's the remedy if she got a k-i-d
Love to my G-o-d
I just get overwhelmed when I see a p-o-p
0 to infinit when I'm in it
Cause my lifestyle don't got limits
Up on your block
With my cock out like can I just hit it
I'm workin'
From the 503
Where the trees grow fast
And the hoes got weed
Oh no not me
But I do OD off hennessey
I'm flyer than fly
All of these levels
I'm higher than high

Nigga, I'm a young rich nigga and you know that
Pull up on Kellz tell him zoe that
Stomp a nigga like I'm wit' The Franchize Boyz
And some white T's and you a fuckin' throwback, pussy
Nigga, you a muh'fuckin' catty
I'm a real ass nigga from the T.O
Got my Haitian bitches cookin' up griot
And a neyo, that's for my 'migo, hol' up

Nigga talkin' shit, he'll go hella 'fense

You never livin' I'ma rub it in
Got a gang, throw it for the revenue
Gated community for my residents, ayy

[Verse]
How the fuck you live so golden?
How you make your mouth and your wrist all frozen?
No handlebars but my hits so Hogan
Pockets make the thou when I'm feeling so bloated
Click, bang, pow now your speakers all loaded
New JC's, I can't wait to put my toes in
Posin' and all them little niggas start jonesin'
We might have something in common 'cause I admit I'm focused
I've been riding through The Hills like Heidi
Twerkin' on his suit like Miley
He chasin' like Coyote, Wile E
So I ain't surprised if his bitch tryna bite me, hold up

[Verse]
Understand the purpose of making
Everything around you better
There are no zeroes after this one
There is no one to destroy your sweater

[Chorus]
I'll try to hum it to you if I can't sing
My baby wants me back before I even leave
Smothered and covered by my high school dreams
Call Mom and Daddy cause the nest is empty
And so are you
And so are you

[Refrain]
Did you meet with your advisor?
Do you still draw in the margins?
Bubble letters reading "WHAT FOR?"
And "I wish I had a stand-in..."

[Chorus 2]
Let's try to make another hit for the teens
I miss your bangs, can you cut them for me?
Smothered and covered by my high school dreams
Call Mom and Daddy cause the nest is empty
And so are you
And so are you
We're gonna start the final session of #PhilosophySunday in about 20 minutes from now #PS
The topic is the painting used for the T&Y cover

Alright let's get this started the final session of #PhilosophySunday is LIVE!
You know da rules tag ya responses wit #PS or be overlooked

Before we get started I want to say thank you to everybody who has supported #PhilosophySunday over the years!

It was started to use Twitter for some a little more profound and engaging and I think we can say we've been successful!

#PhilosophySunday would not have been possible without fans and arm chair intellectuals chiming in on the topics and striking #TwitterGold!

I want to send a very special thank you  to @wirelessphi for giving #PhilosophySunday a little more philosophical credibility!

Hopefully you guys and gals can continue #PhilosophySunday with @wirelessphi or on your own with your own personal Twitter accounts.

Lastly I want to say sorry to all you football fans who had to make the "tough" lol decision 2 choose between #PS or those Sunday games! Lol

So let's get this started. I (as Wasalu Jaco) started painting a couple years back kinda as a hobby & then got a little more serious
#PS
I found out that the painting became just as meaningful as my music in terms of what idea I was trying to express. Layers of meaning. #PS

Story of how one of my paintings became the cover for 1 of my albums I will save for the memoirs but the painting itself we can discuss #PS

Let's have a look at the painting and the cover #PSThe name of the painting is in Italian "Uomo Mangiato Tigre" and ROUGHLY translates as "Man Eating Tiger" #PS

So let's start there. What is your interpretation of the title "Man Eating Tiger"?
Remember to tag responses with #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco does the "man eating tiger" have any reflection of the issues with you as an artist (man) and your label Atl Rec (Tiger)? #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco internal struggle #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco natures life cycle #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco I feel like the meaning behind it may deal more so with how you say it not what you're saying. #PS

Ah! Some very early #TwitterGold from @SpeightSZN
Care to explain what you mean by "how you say it"
#PS

RT: @LupeFiasco man desires to become part of society and in turn consumes himself #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco Man conquering what would be considered a dangerous animal #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco human contamination of something more vicious than it #PS
RT: @LupeFiasco man becoming more ferocious then the tiger, almost like a David Vs. Goliath also #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco Reversals--wildness tamed and consumed. #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco chaos #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco Man is the top but sometimes we behave like animals..although we say we are superior thus man eating(becoming) Tiger. #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco because you can look at the phrase "man eating tiger" in two different ways. It's like a double entendre of a title. #PS

Ah some #TwitterGold from @jjLawson_
So it has two meanings?
#PS

RT: @LupeFiasco man destruction against the last majestic and natural strengths of our world. #PS

RT: @SpeightSZN @LupeFiasco Like a play on words. The tiger has gotten a taste for human blood? #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco the definition I see from it stems back to Tigers being pouched by man. So eating man means self preservation and survival #ps

RT: @LupeFiasco the response lines up w the islamic interpretation of the tiger representing money profits & honor which would be Atlantic #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco struggle to survive, Man eating tiger vs Man-Eating tiger #PS

Great stuff...so yes the title can be read as two ways...let's expand a little bit on that. Who is the man and who is the tiger?
#PS
RT: @LupeFiasco The man being the normal man and the tiger being society itself #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco the man is a anyone and the tiger is society #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco that is up for you to decide... You can chose to be one or the other. Or can you be both? #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco maybe the man and the tiger are one....this could all be about self destruction if that were the case #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco it can be any David/Goliath situation. Western media against the Muslim Faith comes to mind. But it's open to a lot #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco if I follow-up what I said about red (the tiger) symbolizing carnal tones, the tiger engulfs the skull (the man) with rage #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco Truly depends, everyone posses both characters.  #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco One in the same. #ps We're animals, like tigers, but also, there's a 'tiger'. Whats the tiger though? Lol #ps

RT: @LupeFiasco The man = people in power, keeping you, as the tiger, contained and essentially eating the life and inspiration from you #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco the man is the industry, the tiger is the artist. the industry poaches artists for their talents. #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco well "the man" has always been the guy in charge, and we are all animals so you're the tiger? #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco it depends on the situation; for example, man could be the Average Joe, and his tiger could be the daily grind of a 9-to-5 #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco depends on who is saying it; everyone can say they're the man/ tiger when its convenient #PS

Ah very interesting #Twittergold . The changing of identities. Adaptation or masquerading?@gvanx
#PS

RT: @LupeFiasco The tiger is the government and the man is the "taxpayer". Nobody really knows who controls who. #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco why shouldn't we be the tiger fighting internally and man could be society in a conceptualized collective perspective #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco man is the people, tiger is the current establishment in the concrete jungle #PS

Very great stuff! You guys could be tour guides at the Prado!
Let's shift to the other word in the title: "Eating."
Thoughts? #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco eating what? Who's eating? #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco engulfing, overwhelming, controlling #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco whats the meal #ps

RT: @LupeFiasco eating is control. #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco being swallowed by its environment #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco Eating could refer to a conflict between the "man" inside us and the "tiger".. civilized vs instincts

RT: @LupeFiasco captivity of negativity #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco eating could mean conquering... #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco eating can be synonymous with greed. Double burger with cheese.....#PS

RT: @LupeFiasco consumption of morality #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco I look at eating as a pleasure & I see the two entities (man or tiger) finding pleasure in getting rid of the other. #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco Eating could mean conquering or destroying #ps

RT: @LupeFiasco trying to be controlled #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco consuming and profiting at the expensive of the victim #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco eating as in destroying the tigers habitat #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco Eating could mean the tiger is taking your life away, or your rights #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco Killing/eating your inner artist. Making you discouraged to pursue and keep producing your art. #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco It can be consuming sustenance, a necessity for survival, or gluttony, succumbing to desire. #PS

Fun Fact: I don't use the whole title when I talk about this painting with friends. I just call it "The Mangiato" or "The Eating"
#PS

RT: @LupeFiasco The eating is still in process. Eternal consumption. Consumerism?  #PS

Ah some professional #Twittergold from @wirelessphi
A continuum of consumption? How? Please expand for us...
#PS

RT: @LupeFiasco Eating symbolizes survival #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco any form of consumption, be it eat, indulge, be taken over by, etc. #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco "Drinking the Koolaid" Taking everything in; Gullible You are what you eat. #PS

Ah #TwitterGold from @mickystweeting
I never looked at it that way. "You are what you eat" so the tiger picks up human traits?
#PS

RT: Eating can symbolize reward. The man (you) is being rewarded through all the challenges Atlantic (tiger) put you through. #PS @LupeFiasco

RT: @LupeFiasco In this case eating = exploitation? #ps

RT: @LupeFiasco tiger = bourgeoisie, man= proletariat, both in never-ending contest. the purple looks like a scab, the wounds from revolt #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco eating doesn't necessarily mean that the other doesn't exist anymore. Can it refer to become one? #PS

Ah! #TwitterGold from @heyhappymonday
So this painting isn't a violent scene of consumption? It's something softer?
#PS

RT: @LupeFiasco Man consumes but is consumed by his consumption. Can't escape the cycle--always needs fiercer tigers to keep him entertained #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco it's all about perspective, we could pick up the Tigers traits. Savage, "regressive" behavior is omnipresent.. #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco never ending consumption. An indulgent of some sort, probably along the lines of obsession or addiction. #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco #ps "Man Eating Tiger"
Man. Eating. Tiger.
Man, eating tiger.
Man=eating tiger.
Man eating=tiger.

Great way to put it  in an equation form #Twittergold from @drownsomebody82
Fun Fact: there is a lot of math used in Philosophy
#PS

Let's move away from the title and look at the painting itself. What do u see? What is what?
#PSRT: @LupeFiasco a skull, most likely representing man #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco I see bars and sculls #PS

“@WWJRHRD: @LupeFiasco why the frame?”
For fanciness...lol #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco for one I can see that the red skull might symbolize violence #ps

RT: @LupeFiasco Self contained...straight lines...the skull is the only thing that deviates #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco Those 2 brush strokes remind me of a tiger ripping through the man (or vice versa) #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco I see the red from the skull and the red and purple line are parallel could this be stating they connect with each other? #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco colors of a tiger and a human skull #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco #PSRT: @LupeFiasco I see fresh death which is covered in red an also a blue streak an we know only sonic is fast enough to make that streak #ps

RT: @LupeFiasco the skull is fading away. Beinf destroyed by this red shape as an all consuming rage?

Lemme help yall out a little: there is a man, a tiger, flesh, blood, bone and my two favorites..a soul & technology!
See Them now?
#PS

There is also some brain in there...grey matter
see it?
#PS

RT: @lupefiasco Purple=Wounds, , brown and red=blood trail, pink=loss of innocence, white=innocence,beginnings, tan=guilt...red, skull=death #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco I see the tiger being hidden away in the background, the man is trying to consume and cover the tiger but can't completely #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco The soul may be the blue stripe? #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco The lines in the art in different angles convey how "eating the tiger" isn't straight forward, it's complex, difficult. #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco Having a soul, and ability to create technology, separates us from the animal instinct/thirst for blood. #PS

“@yellow_arigo35: @LupeFiasco where is the technology? #PS”
The Silver color field in the upper left
#PS

RT: @LupeFiasco duality of man? The thirst for knowledge/innovation but is also consumed by his primal nature? #PS

Some #TwitterGold to take back to the KTT @oilgangebro

RT: @LupeFiasco Are all those things in the painting or in the viewer who finds them there and the artist who put them there for us to find? #PS

“@Mo_Yasini: @LupeFiasco I'm struggling to see the brain/grey matter #PS”
Bottom Far right...smallest thing used in the painting
#PS

RT: @LupeFiasco the silver (tech) being bigger in area than the grey (brain) makes it seem like your'e saying tech will overcome us? #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco My take on the painting. #PSRT: @LupeFiasco smallest thing used and often forgotten but most important part of the human process #ps

RT: @LupeFiasco   #ps tiger is apex predator. With the brain  and tech, man manages to become a danger to the highest in the food chain  #ps

Wooh! Some #Twittergold from @mrbrpeters
But when man enters nature without all the technological superiority...???
#PS

RT: @LupeFiasco I feel like you are trying to say that we are becoming over-dependant on technology therefore not using our brains that much #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco @mrbrpeters he's at the mercy of nature #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco but man is the most adaptable animal, entering the wilderness without technology does not preclude him from creating it. #PS

Great stuff...let's wrap it up...
Final Thoughts on "Uomo Mangiato Tigre" or "The Eating" as I like to call it...
#PS

RT: @LupeFiasco It feels like epiphenomenalism, the duality between mind & body & technology's affect on it. The tiger symbolizes our instinct.

RT: @LupeFiasco man must stay focused and not let society (the tiger) alter their thoughts and break them down #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco Humans are ruining them self #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco nothing is as evil as we see it to be. It's all perspective. Everything is trying to find their own place in this world. #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco man and tiger in a constant battle over who is the superior predator. #ps

RT: @LupeFiasco Man is oppresses the tiger because of technology, but without it, the tiger wins out.
Man-eating tiger
Man eating tiger #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco "eating" is living life good from bad decisions (drug dealing) until tiger (police) takes your life and locks you in a cage #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco "uomo Mangiato Tigre" is life today as we know it. And we need to appreciate ourselves more then materials #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco the painting's meaning as a whole to me is a man trying to hide corruption (the tiger, tech) but there is still hope (pink) #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco lets just call it mans battle with the world and nature in his eternal bid to understand himself. #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco it further adds to the bigger discussion that'll be expanded in ur LP, so like a quintuple entendre.. Art, tracklist, songs #ps

RT: @LupeFiasco we are depending more on technolgy than our brians!! #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco how bout technology being  the tiger that's eating the man. We feast on it. #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco a lot of things going on, but it seems to tap into a deeper lesson for man. #ps

RT: @LupeFiasco #PS Delicious. Mouthwatering colours.

RT: @LupeFiasco who you are without and with technology #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco It is sometimes necessary to be ruthless in order to avoid being consumed by this savage world.. #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco its about resilience you keep going even though they try to stop you #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco Human progress is like a bell curve, which will eventually bring itself down #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco Be careful what boundaries you draw between yourself and the world around you. #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco no matter how advanced we become as a civilization, we will always be driven by animalistic impulses #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco Man is Trying to Live with both Tiger and Technology with our sacrificing his soul to tech and body and blood to tiger #PS

RT: @LupeFiasco before wrapping it up, can we know your interpretation of it? #ps

Sure @rimzS
For me as the guy who painted it. I see a tiger descending into the body of a man, being consumed. You see the inside of man

But I also see a tiger in the process of ripping a man to pieces. A very chaotic scene of violence.  @rimzS

The meaning of this painting is constantly shifting and changing. I see death and life and a constant pursuit of these two goals. @rimzS

So let's end it here! Big shouts to Everyone who participated in the final session of #PhilosophySunday! I hope you enjoyed it!!!

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
Smoking like five, six blunts in this bitch
My nigga Jon rollin' up, smoking heavy
Shout my nigga Jabari
I ain't been the same since my Grandma passed
Damn, damn
Ma ain't been the same since my Grandma passed
Damn, damn
She don't smoke weed to get high
Damn, damn
She only smoke dope 'cause her friends do it
Damn, damn

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
She don't give a fuck about no homework (She don't!)
She gone pop that pussy but give me dome first (I said!)
She pretend she love me until her throat hurt (She gon'!)
We gone need some rubbers and some more work (Ohh)
We be screaming like our TV don't work (Oh, oh)
Her Mama say to leave 'fore she disown her (Yeah, I'm on)
And I don't blame her either took her from the church
Now watch me burn it down while I soul-search

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Bet I, bet I, bet I burn it down
Bet I, bet I, bet I burn it down
Bet I, bet I, bet I burn it down
Now watch me, watch me while I burn it down

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
We be getting high, acting like we ain't got problems
We be getting high, acting like we ain't got problems
We be getting high, acting like we ain't got problems
We be getting high, we be getting high, oh, whoa

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
She only call me when she wanting to get high
Roll that weed, push them needles
Slide them panties to the side
Off that shit we gon' fuck through the night
Tight white skin, just the right fit for the night
Take another sip if you'd like
Another motherfucking bong rip if you like
You ain't going home for the night
Put you in that seat to the right
Coming home with me for the night
And I'ma get you high, take you places you ain't been
And never have to leave this spot
Melt here right here in the sky
And I can make it rain and watch it wash them sins away
So tell me, do you really feel lonely?
Waking up cold, you be calling out to hold me
To make you feel whole, just not so alone
Never let you go and we never coming down
And you ain't got no home, so we ain't got no problems
If all we need is drugs, then all you gotta do is call me
If all we need is love, then why is hate is what surround me?
Swallow all these down
And let these problems melt and drown me
Just drown me, just drown me

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Bet I, bet I, bet I burn it down
Bet I, bet I, bet I burn it down
Bet I, bet I, bet I burn it down
Now watch me, watch me while I burn it down

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
We be getting high acting like we ain't got problems
We be getting high acting like we ain't got problems
We be getting high acting like we ain't got problems
We be getting high, we be getting high, oh, whoa

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
She done flipped the pharma
She done flipped 'em, she done flipped those
All I wanna know is where you, ooh, ooh
Powder shower, down on you (Down on you)
Know you sour, no sweets from you-ooh-ooh
Baby gon' fuck till the night finish
She gon' suck till the life in it
She probably gone bite till the blood hit it
Got some Polaroid nudes, put a knife in em
You a bad girl (Bad girl), bad habit
Bad girl (Bad girl), good finish
Bad girl, gon' get it, read a bad girl like book, what?
She throw it, throw it back like a hook, what?
See, I don't wanna tell em who I love, no (No, no, no)
She gonna hit me like a plug, whoa
All we gon do is fuck on the floor (Whoa)

[Bridge 1: Matt Champion, Kevin Abstract, Joba]
Bad girl, no
Bad girl, no
She so bad, she so bad, she so bad, yeah
She so bad, she so bad, she so bad, yeah
She so bad, she so bad, she so bad, yeah
She so bad, she so bad, she so bad, yeah
She's a bad, bad girl, woah, woah-oh
She's a bad, bad girl, oh, oh, oh, woah

[Interlude: Henock Sileshi & another guy]
Bitch came through, you know what I'm saying?
She was bad as shit, she was bad as shit
Man, I'm telling you, man
I'm telling you, yo
She had that nice ass on her and shit
But, yo, yo, yo, Tim, Tim, Tim, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen
Listen, listen
Yo, yo, yo, tell me, tell, listen, listen
If she got that thing man I swear I think she got that jungle fever

[Verse 4: Merlyn Wood]
Then I'm Tarzan, homie, if she bleeding, tug it
Yeah I dropped my standards, my teachers aren't
Tryna flunk me down, they tryna hold me back
Fuck Kenan & Kel, man I ain't with All That
No, I ain't fight this hard since my Daddy put em up
I was hitting them trees in his big red truck
Came a long way from having my shirt tucked
And I still don't give a fuck, and I still don't give, uh, no I don't
Duct tape on my jeans, let it show, I'm a fuck up, let 'em know
I'm sorry, Mama, last time I cried was for my Grandmama
Could smell her like the flowers, Africana summer
Should my heart not be humble
Should my eyes fail to see
Should my feet sometimes stumble
On the way, stay with me
Like the lamb that in springtime
Wanders far from the fold
Comes the darkness and the frost
I get lost, I grow cold
I grow cold, I grow weary, and I know I have sinned
And I go seeking shelter and I cry in the wind
And though I grope and I blunder and I'm weak and I'm wrong
Though the road buckles under where I walk, walk along
Till I find to my wonder every path leads to thee
All that I can do is pray, stay with me
Stay with me
I'm sentimental, so I walk in the rain
I've got some habits even I can't explain
Could start for the corner, turn up in Spain
But why try to change me now?

I sit and daydream, I've got daydreams galore
Cigarette ashes, there they go on the floor
I'll go away weekends, leave my keys in the door
But why try to change me now?

Why can't I be more conventional?
People talk, people stare, so I try
But that's not for me, cause I can't see
My kind of crazy world go passing me by

So, let people wonder, let 'em laugh, let 'em frown
You know I'll love you till the moon's upside down
Don't you remember I was always your clown?
Why try to change me now?
Don't you remember I was always your clown?
But why try to change me
Why try to change me now?
Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger
You may see a stranger across a crowded room
And somehow you knew, you know even then
That somehow you'll see her again and again

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room
And night after night, as strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love
When you feel her call you across a crowded room
Then fly to her side and make her your own
Or all through your life you may dream all alone

Once that you found her, never let her go
Once you have found her, never let her go

[Intro: Young Thug]

[Verse 1: Young Thug]

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
I been throwed away what y'all just got
I'm with a bad bitch, she look like she from Baywatch
And I gotta line that you don't wanna cross
I get your head knocked off for an ounce of soft
Put 'em in the lost and found, go kickback in my loft
Inches fast growin' up and just laugh it off
Anyway, I got bills bigger than y'all
And please, don't make me pull the semi
That bitch sing a sad song with another end
Don't make me send them goons to come and clean your premise
All my goons strapped up, every clip extended
And you can get it, pussy nigga, I'm in it

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I've been gettin' money before you niggas
And if they ever, ever play I'ma show you niggas
I'm a thug, I swear I told you niggas

Keep a red flag 'cause I'm patrollin' nigga

[Verse 3: MPA Wicced]
I say we been gettin' money, that should be my middle name
I'm just a young gunner tryna get a little fame
You little niggas lame, bitch, I am a renegade
Before you shoot that burner, you gotta learn to penetrate
But we gonna show them niggas
Pull up and get to it like we owe them niggas
No deal but I'm at the front row of the Grammies
Grab a Swisher Sweet and stuff 'em with them grammies
Now we in the Sicilian suite
No Halloween
But we trick 'em and treat 'em
Chopper make 'em spin
Should I call that the ass cap?
I'm at the finish line you still stuck at your last lap

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I've been gettin' money before you niggas
And if they ever, ever play I'ma show you niggas
I'm a thug, I swear I told you niggas
And I ain't Young Money but I'm above you niggas
Hey, no game'll control you niggas
Keep a red flag 'cause I'm patrollin' nigga
I say, no game'll control you niggas
Keep a red flag 'cause I'm patrollin' nigga

[Intro]
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, will you ever regret me?

[Verse 1]
Just a little girl on the TV screen
Stuck inside a silver cage
Body tangled up in chains
I'm looking for the light in the misery
All this love is doomed to pain
Everyday, I feel the same

[Pre-Chorus]
My tears, they cried like a waterfall in the light
My roses don't bloom since you left me blue
You've got to stop
Tryna mess around with my heart
It's true, I'm through, babe with you

[Chorus]
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, will you ever regret me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
I promise, baby, that you will never forget me

[Verse 2]
Tryna fly away, tryna spread my wings
Soaring like a golden bird
Blocking out the things I heard
97 girls on your cameraphone
Secrets kinda suck to burn
Wish I coulda heard it from you first (ha ha ha ha)

[Pre-Chorus]
My tears, they cried like a waterfall in the light
My roses don't bloom since you left me blue
You've got to stop
Tryna mess around with my heart
It's true, I'm through, babe with you

[Chorus]
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, will you ever regret me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
I promise, baby, that you will never forget me

[Bridge]
Saw you at the party with everybody
You look so lonely when you're on your own
I know we both remember hanging together
We were so happy
Now we're moving on

[Chorus]
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, will you ever regret me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
I promise, baby, that you will never forget me

[Outro]
Saw you at the party with everybody
You look so lonely when you're on your own

[Chorus]
Ah-ooh!
If you got troubles let 'em go
Let 'em soar so high, high into the sky
Just like a red balloon
Ah-ooh!
Don't let your worries get to you
Let 'em float on by, high into the sky
Just like a red balloon

[Verse 1]
Monday morning
Shoot up like a rocket
Yeah, the sun is shining
Keep it in my pocket
Got this golden feeling
Never gonna stop, it just goes on and on
Keep on clapping
Join the celebration
Turn the music louder on my favourite station
Wanna spread my magic all across the nation
Do it all day long

[Pre-Chorus]
Today, I opened my eyes, and now I'm so happy and free
I've got my friends by my side and that's all that matters to me
So, come on, get up and join in, 'cause this is just what you need
Let's do it all day long
Today, I opened my eyes, and now I'm so happy and free
I've got my friends by my side and that's all that matters to me
So, come on, get up and join in, 'cause this is just what you need
Let's do it all day long

[Chorus]
Ah-ooh!
If you got troubles let 'em go
Let 'em soar, so high, high into the sky
Just like a red balloon
Ah-ooh!
Don't let your worries get to you
Let 'em float on by, high into the sky
Just like a red balloon
So turn it up now! (Ah-ooh!)
So turn it up now! (Ah-ooh!)

[Verse 2]
Bees are buzzing
Butterflies are dancing
And the trees are humming
Birds are singing songs
Oh, can't you see it's lovely?
Life is beautiful, and it goes on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Today, I opened my eyes, and now I'm so happy and free
I've got my friends by my side and that's all that matters to me
So, come on, get up and join in, 'cause this is just what you need
Let's do it all day long
Today, I opened my eyes, and now I'm so happy and free
I've got my friends by my side and that's all that matters to me
So, come on, get up and join in, 'cause this is just what you need
Let's do it all day long

[Chorus]
Ah-ooh!
If you got troubles let 'em go
Let 'em soar, so high, high into the sky

[Intro]
Turn the music down in my headphones, yeah
That noise in the background, that's my skateboard
That nigga Mack crazy
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
I put my shooters on they feet
I just give 'em your address, then go to sleep
The money turned my niggas into monsters
The white done turned my niggas into Nazis, Lord
The money turned my face into a stocking
Don't make me turn your baby to a hostage, boy
Don't make me turn the kid to a foster
My woman turn my dick into a Mazda, Lord
Body parts in the duffel
The bullets turn your body to a puzzle
The money turn my bitch into a monster
She know how to get a check and turn a zero to a comma, Lord
The money turn my niggas into killas
The sugar turnt the cocaine to vanilla
The money turnt the bitches into hoes
The money turned my niggas into foes, Lord
I put my shooters on they feet
Give 'em your address, then I go out to eat
Had that snowman in the hood like Jody Breeze
She from the hood but look like she from overseas
I said, "Girl you know I love you and I care for ya
I got some new shoes and a bag of hair for ya"
She say, "Fuck these other niggas, they ain't half of ya
Just keep laughing to the bank, it's hilarious"
I got a stay-at-home gun and a travel gun
Boy, we could sell white, in Africa
It's like, I can't explain, y'all asked me to spit
And now I'm drooling on my chain
"What happened to Wayne?"

[Verse 2]
I'm like, hold up, wait a second, y'all thought I was second?
Hating on a champ, throwing salt and not confetti
We pull up and we shoot, then we park the car and edit
Watch me pull up with no roof
Tthat's cause I walk the dog and pet it
I'm like, hold up, wait a minute, y'all thought I was finished?
Shoot you in your head, then just walk off like I didn't
Let my money talk so much, put my jawbone outta business
Doing numbers in this bitch, I'm like a smart phone with the digits
Bitch!
Riding 'round with the volume down
With the windows up and the choppers down
Soon as we get to your block
It's the motherfuckin' other way around
My bitch say I'm too wild
She don't even know why she stay around
I get home and I dick her down
Now she talking 'bout exchanging vows
If these bullets was paintballs
I could fuck around and I could paint a house
You could tell I'm pimpin'
Tthe way I hit the blunt with my pinkie out
I bring wine to Amy house
We smoke it out and we drank it out
And talk about these pussy niggas
Tthat ain't about what Wayne about
I'm hangin out a Mulsanne without a brain, it's out of its mind
I pull over, I push a button, it change like Optimus Prime
Speaking of change, it's a shame how these lames droppin' them dimes
We aim at your grape, knock it off, now you just vines
Blood Gang, red rain on these niggas, hot if you dry
My gang top of the line, hollerin' out "Squad, take it outside"
I'm a taxpayer, I'm a axe player, gettin' in through the back well
Red devil to the blue collared, un-enveloped blackmail
Fed up with the fed shit and Fed-Ex lost my package
My white girls say "Yeah, nigga!" My white homies act blackish
Ain't tall enough for the NBA, I ain't big enough for the NFL
Should've  been in N.W.A., fuck the police, Five-0 and 12
One time for your mind, bitch, never say "Nevermind," bitch
You a penny short of a dime, bitch, no nonsense
Had a nine since I was nine, bitch
Yeah, born to murder
Bank account on fat, bustin' out the girdle
Tell 'em boys ain't nothin' sweet, it's sauerkraut, ya heard me?
They find ya body in New Orleans on Mardi Gras on Bourbon
Like, oh, Lord, Humphrey Bogart
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a crowbar
For the most part, I'm the southern coast guard
AK-47 spittin' flame like a blow torch

[Outro]
Sorry 4 The Wait, woo

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah—sound, sound, sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin', it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'ma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo!
I ain't tryna chance it, I be with the bands
Like a nigga went to Jackson State or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Verse 2: Drake]
Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
Y'all don't understand, I'm the one they want to hear from
Y'all don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yeah, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that, woo!
Dance how I dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we 'bout to land I can call to tell the woes I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valet at the Hazy
Think I got the shit that had the city going crazy

[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord, tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch

[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Outro: Drake]
Yeah, they don't love you like they used to (What you say?)
In the city with the- windows down
Like I used to (What you say?)
Like I
Take some to getting used to (What you say?)
Man, they don't love you like they used to, man

The T for Tatiana, she can put her legs behind her
She can bend all the way over, I just thank the Lord for that yoga
And the U is for Uma, the position assumer
She so flexible, we try angles like Bermuda
And the V is for Vanessa, voluptuous Vanessa
The W's for Winter, I'm under the weather
And the X is for my exes, fuck 'em altogether
The Y is for Yolanda, the Z is for Zelda

[Hook]
And these are my alphabet bitches
These are my bitches, my alphabet bitches
These are my bitches, my alphabet bitches
I swear to drunk I'm not God, yeah
Drops microphone, I swear to God I'm not God, oh
Drops microphone, I'd rather park and not drive, yeah
Drops Styrofoam, I can't talk, I might cry, yeah

[Outro]
I say, I be on some G shit, I be on some G shit
Check that other nigga for that Louis shopping spree shit
Not me, bitch, no, you won't rob me bitch, no
I said, I be on some G shit, I be on some B shit
When it comes to bitches I be on some A-to-Z shit
I'm me, bitch; this shit like ABC, 123, bitch
To me, bitch; I'm the alpha, the alpha D-O-G, bitch
S-R-Y for the W-A-I-T, bitch

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
With my first hundred Gs bought my mom a house
Bitch, don’t try to suck my dick if you got cotton mouth
Watch these snitches, man, these rats think they Mighty Mouse
In the kitchen, Arm & Hammer, just the right amount
Got the dope spot popping, dope spot jumping
Car parked by itself, robot stunting
And it’s voice activated, I just tell it something
I ain’t even gotta press a button
Viper with the rally stripes, I don’t eat no Rally’s
I don’t eat my words, nigga, I don’t eat no salad
I got too much on my plate, I got too much on my palate
Never seen my car before, it’s like a unicorn in traffic
Too much fucking talent, rap Shakespeare, go Hamlet
You other boys could kiss the game goodbye, be romantic
Please don’t worry, Nancy, all my weed is organic
If my children end up smoking
I'll whip they ass if they don’t pass it
Hold up, I just got a package
I let my bitch test it, with flying colors, passed it
Burning money fast like fire on the plastic
You dead man walking throw some tires on your casket
They say niggas in wheelchairs is half dead as it is
I still keep the heat on me, attitude cavalier
Boy, I think your whole clique’s Summer’s Eve, Massengill
Monastat 7, Vagisil
And my name don’t need no adjectives
And my flow don’t need no ad-libs
The boot, the battlefield
Flag red, like I’m Russian, call me Vladimir
Took a picture with the pistol, gave it rabbit ears
These niggas got fast careers, fast as Batmobiles
My bitches got sex appeal, they like sex and pills, for reals
I’m sorry if you hate you, and I’m sorry for the wait, too

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Boom – It’s my shot like Biloxi
Even my shadow don’t trust me
Big dog in this shit, like a Husky
285, 20 pounds of musty
Stopped by the spot, had to serve Pooh bear
He buy one, I front him one, so I left two there
In a two-seater, pull up popping 2Pac
Didn’t have a safe, so I stashed it in my tube sock
Eat so much Benihana's I need nunchucks
You just a old nigga always saying, "Big bruh"
You a bad bitch always saying, "Big Daddy"
You a real nigga talking ‘bout you want a selfie
Uh, a baby bottle with my shit in
And my role model was a kingpin
I say, "Let’s work," he say, "Let’s work"
Let your next work be your best work

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And it’s that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
And I’m so sorry for the wait, too
From New Orleans to the A, TRU
You test my homies, we ace you
Tity, these niggas monkeys in ape suits
I got a city, got a ocean, got a lake view
She took some shots til she shot down a grey goose
Ooh, this that Sorry 4 The Wait Deuce

[Intro]
(Juice808)
Look what you made me do
Me! That's who

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry for the wait, I'm sorry for the wait (Tell 'em, tell 'em!)
Tha Carter gon' be late so I cooked up a tape (Tell 'em!)
The garden's full of snakes so I had to escape
Lil homie gon' be straight, lil homie gon' be straight!
Woo! OW!

[Chorus 1]
And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
Yeah, and I'm sorry for the wait, too
I told myself to save yourself
'Cause I can't save you (I can't save you)
I send my goons to kill somebody
I need head proof (I need head proof)
Fuck it (fuck it!) This that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
I ain't trippin', I got Barbie, I got Drake too (I ain't trippin'!)
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof (Mula!)
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table
Boop!

[Verse 1]
Who kept this shit together? Nigga, me, that's who (nigga, me!)
Who was there when niggas left us? Nigga, me, that's who
Cash Money is an army, I'm a one man army (yeah)
And if them niggas comin' for me, I'm goin' out like Tony
(Bap-bap-bap-bap)
Now I don't want no problems
I just want my money (want my money)
Ain't gotta hold no conversation
Nor my luggage (nor my luggage)
Tell whoever's countin' that I'm on a hundred
Woo, Birdman Junior – more like Ugly Duckling

[Bridge]
Takin' over, now I'm takin' over, yeah (now I'm takin' over)
Think it over? Bitch, I'm thinkin' forward, ta
I'm sippin' lean out a glass, nigga
All I got is Young Money – no more Cash, nigga, ayy!

[Hook 2]
And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
No more am I my brother's keeper – Cain and Abel
Young Money sharp, I'm still eatin'
I just chipped my tooth (Mula!)
Tell them niggas – no love lost, 'cause I ain't got shit to lose
I told myself to save yourself
'Cause I can't save you (I can't save you)
I send my goons to kill somebody
I need head proof (I need head proof)
I found the needle in the haystack, put the thread through
I tried to stitch the wound back up, but I just bled through

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it's compensation over conversation (no more conversation)
Lord, I must got blurry vision, a nigga's got two faces (amen)
Lord, this game is a vampire (woo!)
Blood, you gotta protect your neck
It'll suck you dry like raisins, Lord
But fuck that, nigga, got it drawn out
Fuck that nigga, I'ma ball out
The day you met me is the day Hell froze
On the day I left is when it thawed out (ayy!)
I'm still in the buildin'
I just had to knock a couple walls down, had to kick y'all out (ayy)
Life is a movie, but sometimes a nigga get too tired of watchin'
And walk out

[Bridge]
Takin' over, Lord I'm takin' over
Dropped the Sorry 4 The Wait until the wait is over
Sippin' lean out a flask, nigga
And all I do is smoke, fuck, and thrash, nigga, ayy!

[Hook 3]
And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2 (sorry for the wait)
Fuck these haters, throw your board up if you skate too
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table
Tunechi – niggas don't appreciate you (don't appreciate you)
You've been down since day one
It meant nothin' on day two (damn)
Sometimes the truth is hard to swallow, and to say, too
But I graduated from that bullshit, now I hate school

[Outro]
And now I'm takin' over, now I'm takin' over (takin' over)
The old me dead and gone, that's who I'm prayin' over
Might have to go back to slangin' yola 'til the wait is over
If so, then I got bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda...

[Hook]
'Cause I ain't got no type, no
But when I met codeine, there was love at first Sprite
Counting dirty money all night, where the wipes?
I like my Swisher Sweet fat as fuck with cellulite
Yeah, my bitch got a wife
Yeah, got me walking 'round feeling like Dolemite
And these niggas talking crazy, but they don't get out of line
They pockets saying vacant, and my shit say occupied

[Verse]
Yeah, bad bitch on my team, mmm
Bad bitch on my team, just like Katniss Everdeen
Got lipstick everywhere
I got her shaking on this dick-dick-dick-dick-dick-dick like a electric chair, lawd
I got liquor, I got cigarettes
And these pussy ass niggas just got PMS
I don't think you should see him, nor live off per diem
She just took off her clothes and said you ain't lyin'
She pretty like the bride of Frankenstein
She kill it like she married to the mob
I can't let one of these hoes lock me down mama
She said don't worry son I'll help you make bond
'Cause these hoes throwing pussy like hand grenades
Don't let it blow up in your face now
Had to buy my dick a barricade
And a mothafuckin' K9
Diamonds in my teeth, I'm eating carrot cake
So hard for me to put on a fake smile
I had to buy my dick a barricade
And a mothafuckin' K9
I got cocaine, I got cigarettes
I don't do neither, it's at my bitch request
She like bad boys, I'm her crook in the neck
Her suicide note say she love me to death
Ooh, for her Lewinsky is so critical
And I didn't mean to get political
I watch her, let her figure slither
But I don't look into her snake eyes

[Hook 2]
I ain't got no type, no
But when I met codeine, there was love at first Sprite
I been counting dirty money all night, where the wipes?
I like my Swisher Sweet fat as fuck with cellulite
My bitch got a wife, got me walking 'round feeling like Dolemite
And these niggas talking crazy, but they don't get out of line
They pockets saying vacant, and my shit say occupied
But when I met codeine, there was love at first Sprite
I been counting dirty money all night, where the wipes?
I like my Swisher Sweet, fat as fuck, with cellulite
My bitch got a wife, got me walking 'round feeling like Dolemite
And these niggas talking crazy but they don't get out of line
I'm sorry for the wait til I drop that Carter 5

[Outro]
'Cause these hoes throwing pussy like hand grenades
Don't let it blow up in your face now
Had to buy my dick a barricade
And a mothafuckin' K9

I told a nigga count on me and niggas lost count
This world is only preparation for the next (alright)
Money bags under my eyes, money over rest
Tryna get a hundred M's out the alphabets (uh)
Open up my mouth to smile, ooh, treasure chest (ooh!)
Ooh, DJ Stevie J keep the Glock on him (Steve J!)
I just bought a new .44 and I'm a proud owner (bop, bop, bop!)

Leggo

[Verse]
It's all about the Young fuckin' Money
It's a war in these streets, I need a Humvee
That AK-47, that's my trusty
Got some tricks up my sleeves, I need some cufflinks
Oh Lord, these niggas soft, these niggas fluffy
Another one bites the dust 'til his gums bleed
Oh Lord, Public Enemy, Chuck D
Me with no money's like a bunny with no front teeth
Fuck me? It's fuck you if it's fuck me
I hit the kush, blow it out like a bum knee
Where the haters? Point 'em out and ask 'em what's beef
Stack of hundred dollar bills in a scrunchie
Oh Lord, kamikaze, kidnappin' killers
Screaming "Fuck the other side!"
She ride the dick, the dick gon' kill her, vehicular homicide
Oh Lord, I'm Sorry 4 The Wait, nigga
I'm sorry for them other guys
Lay a nigga down, Nina sang his ass a lullaby
Wave your white flag all you want, bitch, I'm colorblind
Bad bitch with me got thunder thighs and her mother's eyes
Li-li-li-lick my lollipop like it got gum inside
Miami in the winter, Cali in the summertime
My bitch is independent, she don't ask me for a dime
Love it when we makin' love, hate it when it's fuckin' time
Disrespect the caterpillar, rave about the butterfly
Bullet ain't got no name, nigga, but you could get it customized
Run up in your house, undisguised, why you look surprised?
Motherfuckers better fuckin' hide, I feel like Mr. Hyde
Athletes still gettin' jacked like they missin' tires
Oh Lord, one of the wildest B's in my hive
I'll sting a bitch and die anytime
Hate it when the fuckin' police shut the session down
We just talkin', we just skatin', we just messin' round
Tell them niggas that be hatin' we ain't messin' round
They just barkin', they just fakin', they gon' settle down
We got bitches, we got beer, we got Bobby Brown
Skatin' underneath the bridge, dead body found
Do a trick over the body, hope he smilin' down
Do a trick off of some stairs, land on solid ground
Grizzly Gang in this bitch, check the grip tape
Nigga came on your bitch, ooh milkshake
Chop a cocaine brick like a sensei
Break the great white down to a fish plate
Woo! Pockets on inflate
Got the Yay locked down like Kim K
I been sippin' codeine since 10K
I be cussin' while I'm bustin', "Die motherfuckers"
Oh Lord

[Hook]
Get rid of the residue
Get rid of all the white, like Selsun Blue

My life like Bailey and Barnum's
These bitches ain't got no manners
These niggas ain't got no standards
My bitch ain't got no love handles
Boy, I'm clippin' that toe on that camel
I got bitches that'll kill for me – Charles Manson
Suck this thuggish ruggish bone, swallow that bone marrow
Ooh, chopper sittin' on my lap like the mall Santa
Nigga, shoot you all in your gall bladder
Your pallbearers need pallbearers

I knock your head off – Fumble
Homeboys be cutthroat
That shit got me with a lump throat
But Tunechi bigger than Elvis Presley
Young Money was my best investment
Going harder than my predecessor
I don't break records, I sets the records
Lil Tunechi coming back like Kobe
Niggas stab me in the back, I owe 'em
Got a house in the hills
Now a nigga gotta deal
With mountain lions and coyotes
Semi, I keep that semi
And friendly, I can't be friendly
Freckles, them bullet holes look like freckles
You look like Wendy's
House in the hills jumpin' like Jordan
I can't swim but I'm throwing pool parties
I got a bitch over there, and a bitch over there
A young nigga starting to feel cornered
My LA house jumpin' like Jordan
My Miami house jumpin' like Jordan
Can't forget about my house in New Orleans
So sorry for the wait, I'm sorry
I want my new bitch titties enormous
With a backyard and a pretty garden
With a pussy more pink than a orchid
Young nigga gonna treat it like a florist
I got my side bitch feeling important
I got my main bitch feeling immortal
I got my ex bitch feeling insulted
Cause wifey get money like Kimora
I got a fine bitch feeling exhausted
Cause I'mma put this dick on her 'til tomorrow
I'mma pull up on a bitch in a Gallardo
Then I'mma take the top off like a barber
I go down and kiss her Pearl Harbor
She's so down with this New World Order
Fuck the shit out her in a sauna
Sweat her hair out, she look like Al Sharpton
Got a goon named Fernando
At the front door your condo
Knock-knock, who's there?
He don't care, he's psycho
Bad bitch with a nice throat
She ice cold and she like hoes
Ooh, she just my type
These other hoes just typos
Young nigga coming back like Jordan
So sorry for the wait, I'm sorry
Yeah, a nigga had to go back to the stash
But a nigga 'stache like James Harden
Young nigga drank lean like water
Young nigga smoke weed like Marley
Young nigga on the Moon like Warren
Young nigga on this shit like Charmin
Ooh, my bitch got a rack, Dolly Parton
Fuck her all night long to some Marvin
Fall asleep in the pussy, good lordy
Woke up in a new Bugatti, good mornin'
Young nigga got guns, good luck
Nina Ross say "Me so horny"
Lil Tunechi, at the top it's so lonely
Got fat pockets, never bony
I'm with a model bitch, she so bony
I done shook shit up, it's so foamy
I just cooked this up, it's still hot
You could still smell the kitchen on me
Nigga I'll have your homies
Singing "Damn I miss my homie"
I got a mountain of weed
I got a mountain of cash
I got mountains like Wyoming
I got a bad bitch and she foreign
She always mad with me, I'm sorry
She say "Damn why you can’t call me?"
"Cause they be taxin' for that roaming"
She a tan bitch, she orange
I can’t stand a snitchin' informant
Niggas cooked crack on a Foreman
While y'all boys was still sparrin', uhh
This that Sorry For The Wait 2
Tell the dead homies you pray to
You on your way too
That the truth is hard to swallow
You got fake juice
Even Slick Rick the ruler know I break rules, ooh
Got the gas out shootin' like Jordan
I'll put your homeboy face on a T-shirt
And put your own face on a milk carton
Busy, I’ve been so busy
Ain’t even got time for quickies
That’s why my bitch been so bitchy
I’m out here tryin' to get me
I’m coming back out jumpin' like Jordan
I’m so sorry for the wait, I’m tardy
I wrote a letter to my competition
It started off with: Dearly Departed
Hippie, I be so trippy
Give her pussy a hicky
I hope she ain’t strictly dickly
So we can menage to Nicki, ooh

[Chorus: Shanell]
I'm a thick motherfucker, I sit this on his lap
With my hand on his shooter, I lay them niggas back
Got something for them niggas that react
I'm a bad motherfucker, I got this nigga's back

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Woah
She say, "I know you ain't had yourself a good thick bitch in a minute
I saw some pictures of you boo'd up, it looks like you're starting to like 'em skinny"
I say "Girl, you a trip," she say "I might be a trip, but I ain't trippin'"
She say "Watch these hoes, 'cause they leeches like Robin" I say, "No, Robin Givens"
She was sittin' on my lap and you know a nigga strapped, I know she feel it
It's crazy out here, I'm just protecting myself, you know I'm winnin'
She say "I get it, and if anything was to happen to you, I'd be livid"
"You ain't gotta worry 'bout that, I'll kill a pussy nigga, put his head on exhibit"
Come up missing, think they caught a big fish 'til his body come up drippin'
I treat her legs like like a grand opening, smiling while I cut the ribbon
I took a pill, she took a pill, we was chilling, 20 minutes, now we feel it
She say "I know you probably hear this shit a lot, but you the shit in my opinion"
I said, "It never gets old, thought I'd never say never, but I did it
She say "Who you kidding, boy? You like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties"
I admit it, big booty, big titties; I admit it

[Chorus: Shanell]
I'm a thick motherfucker, I sit this on his lap
With my hand on his shooter, I lay them niggas back
Got something for them niggas that react
I'm a bad motherfucker, I got this nigga's back

[Post-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I like my girls BBW
The type that wanna suck you dry
Then eat some lunch with you
She 'bout that foolishness, 'bout that trouble, too
Booty on bubble, titties so fuckable

[Bridge: Shanell]
Okay, I know you ain't had yourself a good thick bitch in a minute
Saw a flick of you boo'd up, boy, you never liked 'em skinny
You tell me I'm a trip, well, I might be a trip, but I ain't trippin'
I'm just sayin', oh
Boy, this here will keep you warm at night
Feed you good before you catch a flight
Stop actin' like you ain't got no type
Who you kiddin'?

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I admit it, yeah, I admit it
But I got these guns on me right now
I got these drugs on me right now
I got the Feds on me right now
I got two buyers, want it right now
She took her clothes off and I stopped
Looked at my watch, like "Fuck it, why not?"
Guess I could fuck her once then I'm out
Fucked so many times a nigga lost count, Lord
She say, "I know you thought that you was about to get a quick fix, hit it, quit it
But you know you ain't been with a good, thick bitch in a minute"
I say, "You ain’t never lying; thought I’d never say never, but I did it"
She said "Speaking of a line, are you finished? All we need is a witness"
"Girl you trippin', young nigga still livin'"
She said, "Who you kidding, boy? you like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties"
I admit it, I like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties; I admit it

[Chorus: Shanell]
I'm a thick motherfucker, I sit this on his lap
With my hand on his shooter, I lay them niggas back
Got something for them niggas that react
I'm a bad motherfucker, I got this nigga's back

[Post-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I like my girls BBW
The type that wanna suck you dry
Then eat some lunch with you
She 'bout that foolishness, 'bout that trouble, too
Booty on bubble, titties so fuckable

[Intro: Skooly]
London on da Track, bitch!

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
We catch a body and we laugh about it
I fucked her friend, I don't feel bad about it
Grinding, it's agonizing but it's gratifying
Skinny tires on a salad diet
Ooh, I lost my mind, I'm like "Fuck everybody!"
Yeah, I lost my mind, but I got extra copies
Yeah, I fuck so long, it feel like exercising
I'll test a lion before testifying
All I got is hitters in my squad
I could get you killed, all my niggas want the job
I could get you killed, it just take a head nod
I want you dead by tonight, that's a real deadline
Zero fucks given
I make her come to the condo butt naked 'cause, bitch, ain't no stealin'
She still come visit, she don't wan' leave
She compared it to me leaving a witness
I said, "I get it," I keep some cocaine on me for the bitches
And this AK is not for decoration
Fuckboys give me the heebie-jeebies
I got a hit list like the Yellow Pages
Hey, if she can suck a dick and snort a Quaalude
Then, ooh, baby, you got my full attention
Champagne expensive, it taste good or vintage
Open your nose, I'll put some sugar in it
I don't fuck around with them fuck-arounds
Uh, I might fuck around and catch a body
Yeah, I got some niggas that'll hunt you down
Yeah, and catch you slipping like you playing hockey
Woo! We catch a body and we laugh about it
Yeah, I fuck her friend, I don't feel bad about it
Uh, money and drugs, I'm talkin' math and science
Ooh, skinny tires, on a salad diet
Chopper leave you with a half a body
Make sure he dead, before we leave, my nigga, grab his wallet
Ooh, I got the hook up on them rocket launchers
I told Obama, "Fuck with me, you know I got it"
Slime, you need to fuck with me, you know I got it
I know somebody that know somebody
Look, traffic dying, we still trap-or-dying
It's agonizing but it's gratifying
Squad! I could get you killed, all my niggas want the job
I could get you killed, it just take a head nod
Want you dead by tonight, that's a real deadline
Hold up, you ain't got no hitters in your squad
I could get you killed, that's my real day job
I'm a crime of passion, I'm a fucking hate crime
Spit like I ate bombs, Eminem on 8 Mile
I'm the motherfucking man, Scarface, Facemob
Pockets looking like The Blob, chips like Cape Cod
Bust your motherfucking egg 'til I see egg nog
My bougie bitch ratchet, my ratchet bitch a straight snob
Hold up, who know how to read gang signs?
Cause we gon' throw 'em up and we gon' give 'em hang time
I got white, I got brown, sell it at the same time
That's that James Brown, and that's that James Bond, ooh
We catch a body and we laugh about it
It's catastrophic but we glamorize it
It's agonizing but it's gratifying
Skinny tires on a salad diet, ooh!
Chopper leave you with a half a body
No hesitation, no stall, like the bathroom crowded
Chopper so big, so tall, it could wrap around me
Triple A: Astronomic And Atomic

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi
And it's that Sorry 4 The Wait
And I'm so sorry for the wait, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Okay I'ma throw a tantrum on this beat
Now who wanna play fetch?
When it comes to the drugs, boy we shop at Payless
Shawty came too many times, left the whole bed wet
Mack the thinker, I'm the Blood - Method Man, Redman
A scared man a dead man, can I get a amen
You done bought all of them guns and ain't nobody dead yet
Catch your pussy ass in traffic, aim at the headrest
Got your bitch on her knees lookin' like she legless
Like I can't trust my iPhone, I can't trust the clique I ride for
If I see 'em in the streets I'ma have to treat 'em like a rival
I'm a pleasure to your eyeballs
I'm so fly I shop at Skymall
Mama never bought me knockoffs
Lord I need some wood to knock on
Lil Tunechi, I'm a movie, get your gummy bears and popcorn
I got somethin' very hot on my hip, I get my hip hop on
And this little red dot gon' help me hit a nigga spot on
Point guard with the bullets; you say Rájon, I say Rajon
Yeah, hold up; we them boys, we them wild boys
I hold a pistol sideways when I shoot, that's for style points
Menace to society, menace to myself though
Bend but don't break, my niggas call me elbow
And you don't want no problem, I'm a problem
My AK just keep shootin', it's on autopilot
Tunechi what's your fuckin' problem? I got fuckin' problems
Bad bitch on top of me, she started from the bottom
On that Cognac and that loud pack, that loud pack
You gotta shoot the rat when it get too big for the mousetrap
Shoot at me and I'ma smile back and then I'll "Pow" back
Flip you over like a kayak, bitch it's combat
Bitch I'm Tommy Gun Tunechi
Favorite color ruby
Made enough to quit but I keep makin' up excuses
Triple A dick, that's Amazin' And Amusin'
I'm sedated and secluded
I'm the greatest and improvin'
But my baby mama say I'm livin' wrong
Well if I die then I guess she dead right
Catch me walkin' on this mothafuckin' water, nigga
I'll catch your pussy ass at a red light
And you gon' hear that blocka, that blocka
I represent my killers like Johnnie Cochran
We kidnap mamas and toddlers
We don't give a fuck if they ass adopted
Brief moment of silence for Chris Wallace
Soulja Slim, Pac, Pimp C, I hope they smilin'
And Weezy still hot as tamales
My private plane got that wi-fi and that wireless
I'm so sorry for the wait

[Verse 2: Mack Maine]
Spread your legs, girl, I'm tryna break the headboard
I'm a fiend for the bread, I want the whole Dej Loaf
My Chinese chick just want a blunt and some yaka mein
She a squirter so we don't fuck on my Versace sheets
My whole crew'll skate on you like a hockey team
It's like Wayne Gretzky meets Jeremy Shockey
We Young Money Mafia, I rep what I rep
Try to throw salt on my name and I'll put pep in your step
Put your gloves on, nigga please get you a grip
And I bet you rest in peace when I let this bitch rip
The money runnin' like water, check the cash flow
My weed funky like armpits and assholes
Potato on the nine, when we creep we mash slow
And make sure them kids get everything they ask for
My bitch in London said she's a Mack Mainiac
And her sister love Tune, she a Wayniac
It's like she's two different persons; she be chillin', she be cursin'
Cry a river, squirt a ocean
Fuck fast, in slow motion
Man I know Soulja proud of me (ya heard me?)
Man, I know Soulja Slim proud of me (ya heard me?)
Tha Carter 5 a classic, sorry that it's late
And I ain't apologetic, but, sorry for the wait
Tha Carter 5 a classic, sorry that it's late
And I usually ain't apologetic, but
Sorry 4 The Wait
Gone

[Intro]
Here I sit waiting on you, baby, I miss you
Please, come back to me

[Chorus]
A religious love for you, baby, every night I pray
That heaven will send you back to me
Baby, you're all I ever needed

[Verse 1]
Dearly beloved, why did you go?
When being with you forever is all I hoped
Slowly the rain is falling in our home
Come back and start right from going wrong
I'll be still until I hear from you
And I'll be waiting until you return this message

[Chorus]
A religious love for you, baby, every night I pray
That heaven will send you back to me
Baby, you're all I ever needed
A religious love for you, baby, every night I pray
That someday I'll have you for my wife
Baby, you are my life, please believe me

[Verse 2]
For only God knows how much I miss you
And for us to be as one it takes two
So don't you go dying on me not right now
Please change this impossible to somehow
I'll be still there until I hear from you
And I'll be waiting until you return this message

[Chorus]
A religious love for you, baby, every night I pray
That heaven will send you back to me
Baby, you're all I ever needed
A religious love for you, baby, every night I pray
That someday I'll have you for my wife
Baby, you are my life, please believe me

[Bridge]
In the middle of the night, I'll be calling on you
Every single breath I take I hope to see you there
If ever you need a friend, baby, I am here
Don't forget to remember me
Oh baby, come to me, don't you leave me lonely
I need you here with me so return this message

[Chorus]
A religious love for you, baby, every night I pray
That heaven will send you back to me
Baby, you're all I ever needed
A religious love for you, baby, every night I pray
That someday I'll have you for my wife
Baby, you are my life, please believe me

[Outro]
A religious love for you, baby
DETAILED EXPLANATION OF TETSUO & YOUTH (Winter to Spring)
	After listening to Lupe’s new album, Tetsuo & Youth, multiple times, I specifically want to begin this discussion by getting into the album’s last portion which went from the season Winter to Spring. Note that there is a lot of religious content that was referenced in this time period, I will get into all that later
	The season started with “Chopper”, and a lot of people are wondering why a song like "Chopper" is on the album. Well, you can't just go into a song like "Deliver" without giving an example of WHY the pizza man won't come to the ghetto. That is why “Chopper" is there, a hood ass trap song with features from rappers that purposefully spit their verses from the perspective of the killers, drug dealers, and gangstaz that live in the trap
	Moving onto “Deliver,” like I said, this song shows the results of what went down in “Chopper" and the reasons behind not delivering pizza to the hood. If we look at the main line from the hook, "Pizza man don’t come here no more,” it contains a triple entendre: firstly, the forefront meaning is that the pizza can’t be delivered to such dangerous locations; secondly, the PEACE-of man doesn’t come there no more, this is similar to the first meaning because there is violence preventing the pizza man from delivering the pizza, this all goes back to “Chopper” and how the absence of peace stirs up the controversy; thirdly, the piece-of MAN doesn’t come there no more. Literally, this one ties into the next song, “Madonna (And other mothers of the hood),” because the piece-of MAN not being there, referring to the father figures that are absent while their child grows up. With no father figure, the child will live his life without an example to follow or know what is right from wrong, so chances are he’ll be sucked into the hood activities such as drug dealing and gang affiliations which will eventually lead to the concern of his mother for her child’s well being. With all the information thus far, I think it’s time to start pointing out some religious references. Firstly, Madonna in other words means Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus who never had a blood related father. Similarly to how Mary feared Jesus’s prosecution, the last thing that the mothers of the hood want are to see their sons die before their very eyes, but at the end of the song, referencing to the movie Boyz In Da Hood, the child lied dead in his mom’s house just like Ricky in the movie, much like how Mary was in attendance at Jesus’s crucifixion
	The next song, “The Adoration of the Magi,” contains a significant amount of video game references that foreshadow two things: The Game (a character returning from Lupe’s second album, The Cool), and the next song which he appears in, “T.R.O.N." (A video game that came out in Lupe’s birth year). This song is speaking about a Magi, or a king from old times. In this song, the Magi is played by The Game. For those who don’t know his background, he can be described as someone that controls everything in the evilest of ways, and this song is almost a continuation of the song he appeared in from The Cool, “Put You On Game.” Here are lyrics from that song that show the reference to this song, "I’m sure somebody'll find you tied up in this bag behind the hospital, little baby crack addicts had, then maybe you can grow up to be a stripper.” This song, “Adoration of the Magi” continues the baby theme in the chorus as it uses other artist’s albums with babies on the covers (Carter 3, NWTS, Illmatic, etc.) to symbolize that they they are too young to be on a rap cover, but that is why the Game adores them so much and is interested in the youth. That is why he made a reappearance to this album because the main theme of the whole album is about our youth and that is who he is interested in. Towards the last line of this song, it becomes clear that the baby grew up to be a stripper just like The Game suggested and she is even having her own child too but doesn’t know it, this is why she is wanted by the game, or “adored by the magi.” Religiously speaking, the Adoration of the Magi story has to do with the 3 western kings that lived centuries ago. They followed a star and found the whereabouts of Jesus where they presented him with gifts. This event happened on Jan. 6 which marks the same day Lupe released this song. Now that we have went over the 3 singles for this album (Madonna, Deliver, Adoration of the Magi), it’s about the time we can discuss a vital point that Lupe tweeted, he said, “What if I told you that Madonna Delivered the Adoration of the Magi?” Here’s were things get even crazier. From a religious perspective, "Madonna (Virgin Mary) Delivered the Adoration of The Magi (Jesus)." If we look at it from the ghetto’s perspective, he is saying, “Madonna (and other mothers of the hood) Delivered the Adoration of The Game (strippers, gangstaz, drug dealers, killers).”
	Leading into the next song, They.Resurrect.Over.New. will probably have the listener wondering why there are so many video game references, well the answer is simple. If this album is about the Youth (Which Lupe has stated numerous times in many interviews if people were wondering. That’s where we get the title of the album with a little flair with Tetsuo in front of it.), then what other way would be better to portray The Game in front of the youth’s eyes? To a grown man, The Game is the drug game, strip clubs, war zones, etc., but to a baby, The Game is just simply a video game to them. In this song, Lupe said things like “we should be closer” and that is a direct message to the ghetto because his people are killing each other in there. Ab-Soul continues the Game theme by saying, “Trapped in a game where, the trap is The Game, yeah.” And the only way to get passed The Game is to “Proceed to the next level” which is telling the youth to not fall into the hands of The Game and end up as the killers that make up Chi-raq, the strippers that make up the strip clubs, or the drug dealers that make up the drug game. Rather the point of proceeding to the next level is to break away from the shackles, or like Ab-Soul’s last line, “Unloose the Noose.” That is the only way to crush the hood stereotypes. 		 That is about it for the album, but there is still the concept of the seasons that go on throughout the album that seem really random. Lupe described them as palette cleaners to give soothing breaks throughout the album, but it is even more. Notice how in winter, there are no kids on the streets and you get a chilly, eerie feeling from the sounds playing? That was the mood set for Chopper to symbolize that there are no kids on the street during winter, this is why Lupe wants his people to proceed to the next level so that kids can play on the streets again. The album also halts at Spring and there is nothing between that and Summer in the album, it is almost like a sign that it is up for the Youth to decide what goes on in that season. Lupe basically just said, “this is the way.” Now it’s up them. That is about all I can think about in these last 5-7 tracks. If you read this far I hope you have a better understanding of this season’s meaning and message

P.S. This is only a fourth of the album and Lupe’s favorite season on the album is Fall to Winter. I dare someone to decode that season now! :)

That is why he made his reappearance to this album because the main theme of the whole album is about our youth and that is who he is interested in (Which Lupe has stated numerous times in his interviews if people were wondering.

Lupe described them as palette cleaners to give the listener soothing breaks throughout the album, but it is even more. Notice how in winter, there are no kids on the streets and you get a chilly, eerie feeling from the sounds playing? That was the mood set for Chopper to symbolize that there are no kids on the street during that time. This is why Lupe wants his people to proceed to the next level so they can finally put an end to the violence that Choppers bring. That way the pizza man can Deliver to the hood again, the kids can play on The Streets again and ultimately, so The Game can be abolished. Why else would Lupe have a music video for Deliver where a kid has to go out of his way into a nice neighborhood to receive something that can't be brought to his parts? That is the lesson that Lupe is trying to teach. You can't just sit inside all day messing around with The 'Video' Game. You have to eventually get out so it won't end up controlling you, which is the true meaning of proceeding to the next level. In reference to pizza, you can't wait for things to be Delivered to you, sometimes you have to go out of your way to obtain them
--- Finally, we arrive at the last track of the album, Spring. This is an outro filled with cheers and fireworks that signify the end of a truly incredible album. If listened closely, the sounds of the kids can be heard once again meaning the violence has came to a halt. Obviously this is not the case in real life so could this be an alternate dimension where things are different? Furthermore, why are there no songs between Spring and Summer? When you go to repeat the album, it's like a whole chunk of it is missing. Did Lupe leave out a couple months on purpose? Maybe he is trying to say whatever takes place after Spring is for the youth to decide since they're the future. What they choose to do from there is up to them whether they want to stay in the ghetto forever or want to leave one day. It’s up them to decide what happens next. On a side note, Lupe didn't want this album to have a deluxe version, maybe for the reason that it would divert the listeners attention from the inner meaning. He may have truly intended for there to be no song between Spring and Summer so the Deluxe users wouldn't replay the album and get distracted by the bonus tracks
--- Like Lupe said in his interview with Sway, it may take years upon years for this album concept to be fully digested and respected for what it is. He said it may even take 100 years, and here is the reason why. If this album is about the Youth growing up and the ghetto's making peace one day, then the day that happens will also be the same day Tetsuo & Youth will be looked at as a masterpiece. This was the point of the video for Deliver. That video summed up the whole entire album. Lupe was trying to show that unless true peace is formed among the ghettos, then that is the picture they'll be left with forever. It's practically asking the question, if you can't respect yourselves, how can you expect others to respect you? And it's not only them, the youth has to pay for their elders mistakes and the unfairness of not getting a pizza will fall upon them as a child, then other factors will eventually come into play like they'll quit going to school and they'll remain in the hood selling dope for their whole life, so the point is, until their role models can spark the change, the cycle will never end
---In conclusion, this was a summary of the last 5-7 tracks of Tetsuo & Youth. If you read this far, I hope you have a better understanding of the album's concept and the season’s meaning and message.  #FNFUP #T&Y #DROGAS

P.S. If you listen to the album in reverse, it's basically a documentary of Lupe's life thus far and a message for what's to come

Get mine
So fine
Get mine
Baby, baby you can too

[Spoken]
This song is for my grandmother ONLY

[Verse 1]
I I I I, I'm losing touch with everybody
Ooh, what is now didn't matter
Is bruising up my inner body
Ooh, what a time to afraid

[Chorus]
Uh, but I see the bright side
And I know it's okay to smile now
Uh, you gotta see the lights' eye
Every once in a while now oh oh

[Verse 2]
I I I I, I'm losing touch with everybody
Oh oh, so easy now
Cause I'm used to love, and all the sudden all is stopping
Uh uh, please don't leave me now

[Chorus]
No no no, but you gotta see the bright side
And you'll know it's okay to smile now now
Uh uh you gotta meet the lights' eye
Every once in a while
Just every once in a while now now
One now now now
Every once in a while now now
One now now now
Just every once in a while now
#AnothaATracc

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
We're staying all night
We never slow down
I think we better do it like we're doing it now
It's been a long time
Since we've been around
So come on, let's keep doing it like we're doing it
Doing it like we're doing it now
Keep doing it like we're doing it
Doing it like we're doing it

[Verse 1: Perfecct]
Know, it's been a long-long time
But I'm already back for a while, and
I gatta be honest, thought that I will never see ya
Biggest mistake for me to make was to leave ya

Now I can put your pretty butt in a Range
Go anywhere, there's nothing I can't arrange
Yeah, I could have called many times before I just gon' walk in
Let you know that I miss you, but well ... (yeah)
Hope you can leave it in the past
Simply believe me when I tell you that we'll last
And even if your feelings are gone
We have time till the end of this song (Ay)
(It's Perfecct)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Rita Ora]
Friends like a team in a circle
We're together we're so alive
Yeah together we're so alive
Joy like a jewel, let it sparkle
Know that I got your back for life
Yeah I got your back for life

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora]
Locked inside my veins you're in my blood, in my blood (oh, yeah)
And we're united forevermore

[Chorus] x2

[Bridge: Charli XCX]
All night long
We dancing to this song
We doing it, we going on and on
On and on
All night long
We dancing to this song
We doing it, we going on and on
On and on

[Chorus]

[Hook]
All night long we dancing to this song
Keep doing it like we're doing it
Doing it like we're doing it now
All night long we dancing to this song
Keep doing it like we're doing it
Doing it like we're doing it now

[Chorus]

[Outro]
C-X, Rita Ora, T-A, baby

(Snoop Dogg)
Here we, here we go again
Yeah I'm 'bout to flow again
My shit at the record store
Go ahead and blow it in, tell a friend
And don't be afraid about it, brought a couple homies with me
Man, forget about it
From dawn to dusk to run with us
You must bust, cuss and fuss, now
Wow, how now thou
That nigga bow down to the new motherfucking sheriff in town
(Soopafly)
You niggas better watch out
Cause Soopafly's the most anticipated talked about nigga that is not out
Fucking up your whole rep
With the Coast-step, got them bitches shook up
They just coming right to left
I'mma shine when it comes down
To it, if it calls for that shit Soopa don't fuck around
I'm something, else
With my bad self
Hot's the game, but cold is the breath

(E. White)
Most of the niggas on the block know what I'm talking about
You get, put on the set and ain't no walking about, shit
We shoot dice, skip school every day
Oh yeah that back gate is my smooth get away
My niggas Sherm'd out and high as fuck
Well is you down to ride or what? Fuck it!
Hop off inside the bucket
I need some heat nigga, run and tell
Cuz won't you let me know who got a gun for sale?

(Snoop Dogg)
Shit, I'm trying to sell everything
Bang on any gang
That's the way the Chitty-bang
East-side Longbeach City thing
Get it man, rich rollin' 20's gang
Yeah we getting gritty man
(Chorus)

(Soopafly)
If I'mma choose: ya'll lose
We just fucking up your program, giving ya'll the blues, I cruise!
Tried to keep up and blew a fuse
Bitches know the deal because they know the rules, get bruised
I keep 'em paired up in twos
If they don't have my money: bare butt no shoes, dues
Don't give me nothing but good news baby, right now
Don't make me come down

(Snoop Dogg)
Goldie Loc' you got me high as a motherfucker

East-side rip rider

(E. White)
Check it out:

And I really sold dope (really?)
And I really got a strike (really?)
And I still can't vote
But I knuckle up with all you niggas
Shut the fuck, and nut up on that white boy that called you nigga
Why the fuck should I get patriotic?
Stop the war on the cops so we could talk about it?
I probably might not make it through the night
But that alright with E. White
Cause I'm smokin' on that Doh' Doh'
(Chorus)

(Mr. Kane)
We smoke this bomb for you ca-rum-pum-pum-pum
We roll this dank for you ca-rum-pum-pum-pum
No sticks, no stems, no seeds ca-rum-pum-pum-pum
We puff on nothing but chron' like rum-pum-pum-pum
Doh' rae me fah so la tee smoking on that Doh'!

Doh' rae me fah so la tee smoking on that Doh'!
It's just the way that I can't help myself when it comes to this Mary-Jane
It's just the way that it makes me feel when it comes inside!
Comes inside! In my mind!

[Intro]
Boy, oh boy. Any big fans of country music out there?
*Applause*
Yeah! Ooh, some people extending my name, "Boo" that's also approval! I- I think- I think country music Get's a bad- Get's a bad rep, you know? Why is it, when Bruce Springsteen sings about a- when Bruce Springsteen sings about a fuckin' turnpike, it is art, and then when someone sings about a horse, it's dumb, inherently? I don't know, I think some of the greatest song writers of all time are country artists: Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, you know? And if you're writing honestly, that is art! And I would never bash that! Um, the problem is, with a lot of modern country music, wha- what is called "Stadium Country Music"
Sort of Keith Urban Brand of Country music is that it is not honest, it is the exact opposite of honest
*Country music starts playing and Bo speaks in a faux-country accent*
Where instead of people actually telling their stories, you got a bunch of millionaire metrosexuals who've never done a hard days work in their life, but they figured out the words and the phrases they can use to pander to their audience, and they list the same words and phrases off sort of mad libs style in every song, raking in millions of dollars from actual working class people! You know the words, you know the phrases, phrases like--

[Verse 1]
A dirt road, a cold beer
A blue jeans, a red pickup
A rural noun, simple adjective
No shoes, no shirt
No Jews, you didn't hear that
Sort of a mental typo

[Pre-Chorus]
I walk and talk like a field hand
But the boots I'm wearing cost three grand
I write songs about riding tractors
From the comfort of a private jet

[Chorus]
I could sing in Mandarin
You'd still know I'm pandering
Huntin' deer and chasing trout
A Bud Light with the logo facing out
Hear that subtle mandolin
That's textbook panderin'
I own a private ranch that I rarely use
I don't like dirt

[Spoken]
One verse, one chorus in the bag
Now it's time to talk to the ladies
I'm hoping my Southern charm offsets all these rape-y vibes I'm puttin' out

[Verse 2]
Good girl in a straw hat
With her arms out in a corn field
That is a scarecrow
Thought that was a human woman, sorry
A cold night, a cold beer
A cold jeans, strike that last one
I'm wanting you, I hope you're feeling me
Sub-textually

[Pre-Chorus]
We go to bed, you doze off
So I take your country girl clothes off
I put my hands on your body
It feels like hay, it's a fucking scarecrow again

[Chorus]
Like Mike’s Evander-ing
Fuck your ears I'm pandering
I write songs for the people who do
Jobs in the towns that I'd never move to
Legalize gerry-mandering
Tolerate my pandering
You got a beautiful mouth
I got a beautiful (dick)

Y'all dumb motherfuckers want a key change?

[Bridge]
Thematically meandering
Emphatically pandering
I got a tight grip on my demo's balls
Say the word "truck," they jizz in their overalls
You don't know what land you're in
I'm in the land of pandering
And I'll be upfront
I do what I do 'cause I'm a total fuckin' country boy

[Hook: Jaque Beats]
Sippin' on that Hennessy
Sure feel good to me
Let me hit that
Lil mama got that ass to squeeze
I'ma put that ass to sleep
Can I hit that

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Girl I don't know how you passed
You wasn't even in class
Got a D for them titties, and an A for that ass
She bust it open for bobby
She shakin' for bands
Look like buffy the body the way that she stand
Got a fifth of that henny a eight of that gas
And its 3 in the morning nigga you do the math
And add it up, I like a hard drop baby back it up
Tell that nigga that you with you had enough
She a thoroughbred, saddle up
I'm bout to shoot a movie how you actin' up
I'm bout to knock it out the park batter up
Girl you bad as fuck...
I'm in ya neighborhood yea swangin' wood yea
Pull ya brains while I jug girl you got some good hair
Walkin' like a dog yea, break it off yea
On the table cloth yea, wipe it off there
I see ya nigga hatin' there a little salt there
I just drop a little sauce yea, i'm the boss there
Stretch the box out yea, on ya couch yea
Kill the pussy off yea, and i'ma chalk there
Bands

[Hook: Jaque Beats]
Sippin' on that Hennessy

Sippin' on that Hennessy
Sure feel good to me

[Verse 2: Jaque Beats]
See I woke up this mornin' with a Spanish brunette
Theres a chance I get to knockin' call it rushin' roulette
Ain't no groceries in her dorm so she rushin' to get
Somethin' to set the mood I know she could cool
So I let her get the 4th letter whoa
Hit it in a Volkswagen, and her name Jetta
Hit it after church so we all sinners
Matter fact she's in the choir, she do everything 

[?]
And everyone's a winner when we at the ocean
Bikini's on binoculars i know they scopin'
Hotel I let her be my chauffeur
Love, how she look with her garage open...
I'm bout to double park that in her heart yea
Fuck around and do a cartwheel leave ya broad there
Test drive that's a car sale new Ferrari
Feelin' on the hump hump shawty this is not braille
She a cougar that's a all tail with a tall tail
Other women be like, oh hell, he ain't for real
She show me that monkey she can't keep it in a ball rail
So she throw it at me and I bat it, i'm like aw yea, aww yea

[Hook: Jaque Beats]
Sippin' on that Hennessy
Sure feel good to me
Let me hit that
Lil mama got that ass to squeeze
I'ma put that ass to sleep
Can I hit that?

Sippin' on that Hennessy
Sure feel good to me
Let me hit that
Lil mama got that ass to squeeze
I'ma put that ass to sleep

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Uhh well I be god damned what it is
Bitch shake it for you sit back 

[?]
I know yo baby daddy so you with that nigga still?
Fuck him girl if he hit you, I get that nigga killed
Ass big like a tractor trailor wheel
If money get it done we can make a deal
But you gotta bring ya girl make her take a pill
And do it all babe tomorrow you'll be naked still
Honest and truly I do concur
That you a super bad bitch I ought to buy you a purse
You got a mediocre nigga shawty I come first
And if I come first treat it like starburst and just...
Chew it, shawty you know how to do it
My dick so big its in you I could nail the pussy to it
I bet I get it hot and wet like some lighter fluid
All it's missing is some fire wood to put some fire to it
Ay

[Hook: Jaque Beats]
Sippin' on that Hennessy
Sure feel good to me
Let me hit that
Lil mama got that ass to squeeze
I'ma put that ass to sleep
Can I hit that?

Sippin' on that Hennessy
Sure feel good to me
Let me hit that
Lil mama got that ass to squeeze
I'ma put that ass to sleep
Can I hit that?

[outro: Jaque Beats]
Yo its, its Jaque i make, i make beats and uumm...awkward

[Verse]
Represent intelligence I did it before
When I came through, sold out all the albums in the store
Shout to Joey Bada$$, that’s that, uh
Now we bout to backtrack
When I first started I was seventeen
Came up in the game, had a ring, had a chain, had some things
Shout to Chilly Chill man he showed me the game
Drove me around the city in the black, black Range
But now I’m back, at it attack
Had to do it again, and now we signed to Epic
But I ain’t never stretched I got robbed on my first deal
And that’s so real you wouldn’t even know it
That was about nineteen and I didn’t even show it
But I was the best rapper in the crew and they knew
Shout to 

[?] and shout to Butcher B
And shout to D-Low and 

[?]
Yea, yea, yea, and bring it back
We was raw dope records
Every single sector we was in, we would bless it
Howard home coming, I did that before
And they ain’t even know
Now, was we in this, or what were you doin’
I signed to Arista next and I was brewin’
Shout to L.A. Reid, did my thing on the page
But never planted the seed to turn into a stage
Yea, I was growin’ stage up
And when I got up on that joint, I was blowing stage up
Now, I’m back in the rage I said the stage twice
That’s cause I set the stage, so nice
You ain’t even catch it so I gotta bring it backwards again
On the stage I was attacking my friends
But I was attacking my foes, save no bitches and save no hoes
Sway, you know how it goes in these streets
How it goes in these beats, how I do it so sweet
How I do it so neat and I wrap it in a package
And I bow-tie that every time that I wrap it
I lost a little breath, this is real time rap
In real time, every time, I real rhyme that
Yes, yes, I will rhyme that
And they can’t do it like I do, they try to but
You know it’s blessings when you come through like this
Impressed like this and how I’m dressed like this
All black cause I’m mourning for my brother
I love Esco, they don’t even know, how much above you
I don’t place anything
I wed the game like a wedding ring
With a diamond set-it-ting
And you know I’m never settling
I rap burn things down like acetylene
I said this before, only wrestling with settling
I only settle if I wrestle with everything
And I mean it from the heart
From the time when I was in the park on the benches I was rapping
Snapping, trapping and doing my thing
Yea I did the street a lil bit, did the heat a lil bit
Did the beats a lot, and now I can’t stop
I dropped my fifth one, I feel so proud
I hope you blow it up while you smokin’ your loud
Or you sittin’ in your room in the basement and you cherish it
Uh, every rapper I embarrass with the flows and the structure
The beats, rhymes and rhythms
How I give ‘em, how I put it together in exorcisms
How it skz’s like a schism
Bring scissors how I cut through the rhythm and bring it back again
And again, and again
Shout to all my friends, shout to all my brothers, all my lovers
I love y’all
And shout to Young Thugga, you a good lil dude
I like the way you rap too
See, there’s blessings in this
It’s a message in this, it ain’t no testin’ in this
Now, let’s get back to the narrative I signed to Atlantic
And everything was good
Until Craig Kallman called WGCI and said “stop playin’ Kick, Push”
We was like “what the fuck?!”
Fuck are you doin? Tried to bring my crew down
Tried to ruin us
But you didn’t know what you was puttin’ into in us
Then Chill got locked up and everything stopped
I wanted to stop rapping, but I couldn’t
On the phone when I’m cryin’ like “I couldn’t”
But he was like “nah, you gotta carry on”
At least for me, your family, you gotta bury songs
That mean you gotta dead ‘em
Every time you got in the studio he put the Glock to ‘em and head ‘em “bang!”
Yea, doin’ my thing, shout to the gang
Shout to the man, it’s how I maintain living in the mainframe
Should I ever do this before, again, I dunno it’s the same
It’s a shame but sometimes you gotta get on that paper plane
And fly to the other side of the earth
And show you truly what’s your worth and your values
If they don’t know you gotta show ‘em how to
If they don’t understand then you gotta make ‘em over it
You gotta do it again, and again, and again, it’s over with

What If We Were Born Into A High
And The BorinG'est of Guys Were InterestinG in Her Eyes
Imagine That We Hum a Lullaby and We Never Wonder Why

Without wonder if its real
Emotions are crystal clear

Would We Love It ?
Or wanna Switch It Back ?!

[Intro: Elbee Thrie]
Real love's so hard to find
Just when you think you've found it
The illusions in your eyes

[Verse 1: Elbee Thrie]
That's why I love the moon
Every night it's there for you
It's constant
Unlike these human beings
Who lie about what it seems to be
You think the Earth is where you stand
You're in the palm of someone's hand
And that's why I love the moon
'Cause it's always there for me
Every night up out my window
And that's why I love the moon
'Cause it's always there for me
Every single night I look outside
It's right there for me
And my mind
And that's why I love the moon, yeah
Because people can consume my love
In the wrong way
So I send it up
At night, at night, at night

[Chorus: Elbee Thrie]
Real love's so hard to find
Just when you think you've found it
The illusions in your eyes, it blinds
So be careful where you look for love, ohh
Just be careful where you look for love, ohh
Real love's so hard to find
Just when you think you've found it
The illusions in your eyes, it blinds us all
So be careful where you look for love-ove
Just be careful where you look for love, ohh

[Verse 2: Sheriff PJ]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, that's why I let the moon shine
('Cause through the time I've been confused on how to move on)
I'm stuck in between what wasn't and what could be the truth, ha
(Still up tryna escape the demons in my room, yo)
You see it's no change droppin' we learn to maintain profit
And how could anybody else feel pain when they brainwash us?
And watch us every time we make exchanges (We slaves)
Locked in a box, we use our mind just to escape all the same shit
I'm tired of the pain
Love is blind to the flame
That's why I look up, never hide behind sky's when it rain
Promises cooked up exercisin' through denyin' the pain
That's why I look for ways find whatever lies in the rain
'Cause shit change
I don't blame my father for lampin' I believe that helped
Went from tryna grow as your son to tryna grow as myself
So understand it when I'm stranded, takin' chances
Know I need that fall
Flat on my back, you just relax and kick your seat back, uh
'Cause when you think
That's when you let time run and escape what your mind loving
That's what you think
So what you think?
If love was easy to find, we wouldn't need it to complete our lives
So

[Outro: Elbee Thrie]
Peace to the moon
Peace to the stars
Peace to Saturn
And peace to Mars
Elbee Thrie Verse 1:

On Monday ... She Wants Me

Uh, a hundred thou', three kilos, my chain is illegal
My life a Tarantino, tomorrow you in the sequel
It's big dollars fuckin' with this big screen
Shit done got crazy on the side lately, tell her don't scream
Kick it like dojo, know you used to the finer things
Raised from good homes, imagine how that pussy leak
Hood Mona Lis', model for me in that lingerie
Diamonds covered rosary, say a prayer then I eat
Downtown penthouse, see the city sleep
All six bitches still high from last week
Back at it, the routine is automatic
They love my aesthetics, I love they ass clappin'
It's all sex, we do it the best on the West
They say I walk around like I got a S on my chest
SLR ordered, that bitch comin' tomorrow
King shit, them red robes
What you think you out here for? So come on

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Tyga & Both]
I see you working that, baby (Yeah)
You need to bring your ass to the Westside (Haha)
Tonight we tryna freak some

So tell me, girl, what you drink?
We gon' have a good time
It's a party (Yeah)
Oh yeah, girl, it's a party
So bring your ass to the Westside

[Verse 2: Chris Brown, with Tyga]
Look, Virginia nigga on a California king size (Yeah)
Pull your panties to the left, let a G slide
Bonnie & Clyde, ride or die, that's what you need right?
Her daddy OG, she grew up on the Eastside
Bumpin' and humpin' like it's nothin', feel like a asthmatic
69 her favorite, that's simple mathematics
And she can tell by my eyes I love that ass-clappin'
A nigga lookin' surprised, she got my name tatted (Oh-oh-oh)
She a fan, fuck any nigga affiliated
Went from drug dealin' to sports, this bitch don' graduated
But I deal with her, and let her think she made it
I'ma spend it all, shit, I'm just playin', baby
A 100k for the strippers, just me and my niggas
After that, we party with bitches and sippin' on liquor
In LA, them niggas let them texts fly
Shit, that's how we do it on the Westside, ha!

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Tyga & Both]
(Oh yeah)
I see you working that, baby (Yeah, baby)
You need to bring your ass to the Westside (Fucked up)
Tonight we tryna freak some (Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge: Chris Brown, Tyga & Both]
If you ready, just give me a sign, girl
'Cause that body looks amazing, girl
And I'm ready to give you the time of your life, baby

Girl, I'm falling in love tonight (Uh, tonight)

I see you don't give a fuck tonight (Tonight)

It's a party (Yeah)
Oh yeah, girl, it's a party
So bring your ass to the Westside

[Verse 1]
It's been hard on you, but it's been hard on me
Can't you see my point of view?
And every time we speak
At least be weak
When you're running away 'cause you don't wanna hear what I say
Is it me, is it you, could it all have been a mistake?

[Chorus]
But I won't give up
Make it worth my time
We've been in it so long we forgot how it feels to divide
And I wanna stay
And I won't give up if you make it worth my time
We're approaching it wrong and it isn't enough to get by
And I wanna stay

[Verse 2]
Nobody's fault, but we both feel the pain
It's a shame
And we've talked of change but everything remains just the same
When you're running away 'cause you don't wanna hear what I say
Is it me, is it you, could it all have been a mistake?

[Chorus]
But I won't give up
Make it worth my time
We've been in it so long we forgot how it feels to divide
And I wanna stay
And I won't give up if you make it worth my time
We're approaching it wrong and it isn't enough to get by
And I wanna stay

[Bridge]
Would you sacrifice who's wrong or right?
Let's stick together now more than ever

[Chorus]
I won't give up
Make it worth my time
We've been in it so long we forgot how it feels to divide
And I wanna stay
And I won't give up if you make it worth my time
We're approaching this wrong and it isn't enough to get by
And I wanna stay

[Chorus] x2
Pick me up, pilot
Fly me straight to the island
Soon the sun gon' be shining on me

[Verse 1]
It's a jungle, out there is dangerous
And the beast are hungry, got their eyes on us
And the waves are high as the sea is deep
And the sharks gon' look, when they see us we

[Chorus] x2

[Verse 2]
It's a battle out there and their guns are big
People colder than you could ever feel
And their hearts are twisted and their spirits are low
Misery loves company they won't let us grow
Misery loves company they won't let us grow
Misery loves company they won't let us grow

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Get away
We've got to get away
We need to get away
We got to get away, get away, get away

[Verse 3]
Baby we, been forgetting
We got to get away
Look at what we're accepting
We've got something they just can't see

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Oh! Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady!

[Chorus]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre!

[Verse One]
They see that low rider go by there, like "Oh my!"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
Cuz over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Derado
The hell if I know
Do I want leather seats or vinyl
Decisions, decisions garage looks like precision collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

[Chorus]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Verse Two]
Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Fix your musk, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's son who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts, me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust man they love me when I lay in the cut
Missed the cut the lady give a eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cuz when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol The platinum duo's back on you hoes

[Chorus]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Verse Three]
It's sorta like pourin' Drano down a live volcano
You never know what'll happen next, it may blow
Same thing happens to the beats when Dre blows
I talk shit, but my dick's long as my payroll
I get ass like a ball player, but I'm a boss player
Pimpin' hoes from here to Australia
Till I get heart failure
Look at ya half of ya'll, all scared
Other half, hands up in the air, like "Awww yeah"
This is our year, this is what you call sheer talent
But I think at this point it's just obvious
Fierce, they say my music's good for all queers
Cuz I make your ear ring, get it?, piercin' all ears
Call us the Mafia, we got the fucking mob here
Gimme the hate and I'll feed off of ya's all year
Shit, I'm just doing my job here
You don't want no problem, do ya?
Fuck it, I'll even crack a bottle for ya

[Chorus]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Intro]
I wonder

[Chorus]
Could it be you and I are a sign of the times?
In the darkness it shines like a sign of the times

[Verse 1]
When I feel like I'm all out of love, and my time is up
It scares me, judge us fairly
If only music could make us understand
I swear sometimes I hear a ghost in the radio
I went from station to station lookin' for somewhere safe to go
I'm not the only one seen it
So I know I'm not crazy
'Cause I can't move 'til it makes me
Please try to save as many as you can

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Well it's something you can't deny
Go 'head and ask me why
For the meaning
And if you think you're dreaming
Oh I've got the perfect song for you
If I time it just right, I won't have to say it again
Will my 2 cents be enough for you to play it again?
I put some weight on it
You see, repetition can change the human condition
Oh listen if it's the last thing that you do

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Come on
Come on

[Verse 1]
What are you so afraid of?
We are your family
Everybody's waitin'
So come on try to dance with me

[Chorus]
The groove is our guiding light to get us through the night
So hold me close and we will dance to the rhythm of life

[Verse 2]
Oh and I 

[?] lifetime is not waitin'
N-n-no, time's not waitin', n-n-n-no, no time's not waitin'
Either dance or die and that is the only ultimatum
N-n-no, time's not waitin', n-n-n-no, no time's not waitin'
So dance up on your fella
'Cause the beat is our borrowed time
We are inexperienced
A part of some grand design

[Chorus] + 

[Verse 1] + 

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Groove
The rhythm
Dance
The rhythm
Life
The rhythm
Think about that

[Verse 1]
If some strangers all opened up and invited me
I can't promise that I won't
And she may be someone you can only see in the dark
You may care, but I don't

[Chorus]
See I'm a simple man
And you don't have to understand
I love whoever loves me
Said I love whoever loves me

[Verse 2]
She could be purple with pink polka dots
But if she loved me, truly loved me, why not?

[Chorus]

[Hook]
All I wanna do
Is keep her love
Keep her love
Keep her satisfied
All I wanna do
Is make it right
Make it right
Is make you smile tonight
All I wanna do
Is give you that thing, playing as saw you and your girlfriend sing
All I wanna do
Is get you back tonight
I gotta get to go, get to go, get her back
I gotta get to go, get to go, get her back
I gotta treat her right, I gotta cherish for life
I gotta get to go, get to go, get her tonight

[Verse 1: Robin Thicke]
I never should have raised my voice or made you feel so small
I never should have asked you to do anything at all
I should have kissed you longer
I should have held you stronger
And I'll wait for forever for you to love me again

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Oh, it’s so hard
It’s so hard
Oh, it’s so hard
Oh, it’s so hard
But it doesn’t have to be

[Verse 2: Kamos]
Feelings to budget damn this love cost me, it doesnt have to be
Minutes I pause to your pictures on phone see, I want you back with me
I'm killing this rift, un splitting my chick
My mood is a piss me flushed wit' a coupled of drips
The you as I miss, to counter wit'  a cruel and dismiss
You ain't the same I use to see in a bliss
All them beautiful times, fast forward damn we need a rewind
Where them sketches that we use design, should've them painted them lines
If we only shaded well I'm trynna color and defeat our maligns, baby all I wanna do

[Hook]
All I wanna do
Is make it right
Make it right
Is make you smile tonight
All I wanna do
Is give you that thing, playing as saw you and your girlfriend sing
All I wanna do
Is get you back tonight
I gotta get to go, get to go, get her back
I gotta get to go, get to go, get her back
I gotta treat her right, I gotta cherish for life
I gotta get to go, get to go, get her tonight

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Well I walked to the ends of the Earth
In the burnin' hot Sun and the freezin' cold
And I found her
Yes I did
I'm talkin' 'bout a beast of a woman that'll moan so strong
Hiccup would draw a crowd around

[Chorus]
Hey look what I discovered
She lives, she lives
Why would I ever be selfish about her?
I'd share her with the world
It's a crime to be selfish about her
Man is not her maker, she's a mystery
She is precious, not a pet and she is wild and free
And she'll never bite the hand that feeds her
And she knows her way home

[Verse 2]
One shot then she howled at the moon
Then I leaned in and licked her wound
And kissed it
Then I sang her a song
How could something so strong, be so submissive?

[Chorus]
Hey look what I discovered
She lives, she lives
Why would I ever be selfish about her?
I'd share her with the world
It's a crime to be selfish about her
Oh look at the magic that your mother's done
Bless us all and give birth to another one
I'll make sure you have shelter
And this will always be home

[Intro]
Tonight we're gonna do something a little different

[Verse 1]
I said don't even look at me if you love her
I am one sexy mothafucker
Once you have me you won't want another
Sailors on the ship hollerin' 'bout hubba hubba
Ooh baby, ooh, what you wan' do?
I want teach you somethin' new
When I stand up in the 

[?] he be like comment t'allez vous
Oh I can speak another language too

[Chorus]
My whole body is chocolatte
Be careful or you'll get some on your face
Oh wanna, wanna, wanna, bang, bang
Here, have a taste

[Verse 2]
I think you should go 'head and keep her
Why? Because she's so much cheaper
But if I ask, and he go get it
There's only one banana, maybe we can split
Ooh baby, ooh, what you wan' do?
I want teach you somethin' new
But it's not only you they wanna oochi coochi too
Every day it's like it's deja vu

[Chorus] x2
He drive up in a summer sky, blue Bentley
Death reflecting in his eyes
Thought about all the women who loved me
I said, "oh no!"
He said, "get inside"
I said, "oh no!"
He said, "get inside"

I got into his summer sky, blue Bentley
Sun reflecting in my eyes
Thought about all the fun I had lately
I said, "Uh huh" I said "I want to drive"
I said, "Uh huh I want, I want to drive"
We drive, We drive

You say you wanna go swimming in my ring
It's green and shimmering
Like my lipstick, the color of dawn
Like my lipstick, the color of dawn
We got out of his summer sky, blue Bentley
Death reflecting in the sky
He held my hand to the ocean he lead me
I said, "uh huh, I want, I want to die"
"Uh huh, I want, I want to die."

[Intro]
That my young ho
I don't want nothin' old but a bank roll, man

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
She don't think

Stupid bank roll
Quadruple your bank roll

She suck dick like a pornstar
She's a monster

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
My necklace very dumb
And I know Baby just 21
Got her panties drippin' wet
VVS my wrist and neck
My car, my house, might feel the check
White baguettes I'm drippin' wet
21 at Georgia Tech
In Miami gettin' Florida neck
You niggas say y'all fuckin'
But y'all hardly, hardly havin' sex
It's Gucci, blessed
I'm super fresh
Finesse the cheque out the connect
If that's your chick, I'm not impressed
Twentytwo with perfect breasts
She love to pop, don't window shop
Can't flex on her, got stupid guap
You can tell she doin' well
She fresh as hell, her nails Chanel
Super player, might as well
Come here & meet East Atlanta's mayor
Yellow Rollie, black Gazelles
Crackin' jokes like Dave Chappel
Bricksquad cartel don't drink Martel
V12 pull to 5-star hotel

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
When they say Guwop is charming
Please, don't be alarmed
Cause your girl seen me perform
I snatch your girlfriend off your arm
You actin' dumb, she drunk my cum
It's dynamite, her head's the bomb
And I'm attract that she's no nasty
Spittin', chewin', smackin', actin'
Like a fire-breathin' dragon
Gucci mackin', draggin' bitches
Like a titty-saggin, nigga-naggin'
Bitch-hit-so-good-niggas-braggin'
Addicted to dick, she's an addict
She's a nympho, it's a habit
It's your dick, bitch, you can have it
Klepto see dick, got to grab it
Smokin' cannabis, drag it from Custer to Canada
And you an amatuer, Baby
You in need of a manager
Put you in calendars
But first, let me check out your stamina
A straight cannibal
She ate my dick, man
She's an animal

[Hook]

[Intro]
Seem like girl got more heart than a nigga do

[Hook]
My lil' bitch a G
My lil' bitch a G
My lil' bitch a G
My lil' bitch a G
My lil' bitch a G
So I fuck her like we beefin'
And if she ain't with me
She feel like she creepin'
My lil' bitch a freak
I fuck her each and every weekend
And when she not with me
I look for her like we beefin'

[Verse 1]
Dope game hectic
Nigga don't get a pension
Oh, I forgot to mention
Chances of prison
Your bitch ain't missing
Nigga, you got me twisted
I'm Gucci, super friendly
Baby just couldn't resist me
Pillow-talkin', kissin'
Man, these niggas trippin'
If I'm just reminiscin'
Why you gettin' so defensive
Wait one minute
Ballin' like we the Pistons
Ferarri boy business
Baby, check out my engine
Switchin' gears quickly
Life is pole position
Your homeboy's a trick
He came home with a hickey
Since I'm in a 'enzo
Might as well roll a ickey
This bitch just text me
Baby, baby, ya miss me

[Hook]

I'm talkin' loud, smokin' loud
Roll a half-a-mile joints
Stuffin' 'em like they Black & Mild's
I just rolled me five blunts
I'ma put you niggas on somethin'
I'm 

[?]
She want some, she worth some
I murk somethin', I'm worth somethin'
She's a monster, porn star, avatar, Amazon
I'm paid in full like Cam'ron
And healthy and handsome
Baby, you the one
You the bomb, Boston Marathon
I rap, act, and still trap too
That's triathalon
I got a magic one
I have you sprung
Bishop Don Juan
I got monkey nuts on all my guns
King Kong, son
Think I'm Cheech 'n' Chong
Fuckin' up my lungs
Smokin' with your mom
Addicted to me
Nicotine gum
Need to listen to me

[Hook]

[Outro]
Guwop, Guwop, Guwop
Guwop, Guwop
Guwop

[Intro]
And I know that's right

[Chorus]
She may be a lot of woman
There's a lot more work to do
But one thing's for certain
Big girls need love too

[Verse 1]
Hey big mama what you doin' tonight?
Are you gonna go my way?
Always got somethin' good to eat
Always got somewhere to stay
Well you're not too big, you're not too small
I think you're wearin' it well
She's the type to come over and cuddle with
When the winter is cold as hell

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Well she's man's best friend in the midnight hour
No place I'd rather be
Hell she told me I could move right on in
And live there forever for free
Well if lovin' her is wrong, I don't wanna be right
You know it ain't no crime
No it ain't exactly a ménage à trois
But it's still like two at a time

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Ain't nothin' wrong
It's got to be strong
Cause they can go all night long
So hold on

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
You are just as beautiful as the day we met
Baby
Seems like a million years ago, you haven't changed yet
It's amazing
Why do you keep loving me the way you do?
Tell me
And I watch you give your all, stumble and fall
But never fail me

[Chorus]
Ooh you're making me wonder about you
Wonderin' how my life'd be without you
Such a nightmare
You're making me wonder about you
Wonderin' how my life'd be without you

[Verse 2]
You're an angel by my bed, watching over me
When I'm sleepin'
And you're the voice of reason that keeps on echoin' in my head
When I'm cheatin'
Said why do you keep on loving me, the way you do?
Tell it
I watch you give your all, stumble and fall
But you never fail me

[Chorus] x2

[Verse 1]
Let's take a little trip down Memory Lane, everybody
Let's see if the future could follow me that far
Come just the way you are
Now everybody knows how the story goes, yes you do now
You're starting to get that little tingle down your spine
'Cause you know it's time

[Chorus]
Dance, little children
Dance, little children
Dance, little children

[Verse 2]
Come on everybody, won't you clap your hands together
Have a little fun, let me make you feel alright
Until you're burnin' bright
I said they're gonna be playin' our song forever
No standin' around, sayin' you don't know how
You're s'posed to do it now

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Gon' and smile 'cause you've come a long way, baby
No matter where you're from, it's all about where you're at
You just remember that

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
It's a lie, nobody's free
We're bound by the powers that be

[Verse 1]
Yeah you got a job that you hate
It's functionin' on a fixed rate
Workin' 24 hours a day only to get nowhere fast
And all the ass kissers are passing you by

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Yeah we're all doing time on planet Earth
All the way up until that day they put you in the dirt
But just because your money can buy you some time
Does not mean that you do not have to die

[Outro]
Why?
For now say goodbye

[Intro]
Homeboy
Turn me up
Guwop
Mike Will
EarDrummers
Turn up

[Verse 1]
Purple 'rari
Purple rim
Purple bad bitch with a purple tan
Orange frames, orange Lam'
Orange 

[?] and orange 

[?]
Red Charger, red Bentley
Bitch, I came up at the Red Room Inn 

[?]
Twenty hit the room
And the four just missed me
Weed so strong, you can't light no incense
Gucci Mane's a multi-multi
Hundred thousand dollars, rent me
My goons might dress up in bow ties
Always keep three killers with me
Gucci Mane don't back down, no guy
See your ass later, let a couple months go by
Whippin' up the dope, true story, my old life
Still got work like Drake, nigga, no lie
Room of house full with nothin' but smokers
In the kitchen, now I'm cooking up that coca
Used to get the dope right from my brother
My plug in the 

[?] come right under
And you can't pull shit with a set, your Honor
Spikes in my cleats cause I'm a punter
Black shades on like Stevie Wonder
Cheetah print on cause life's a jungle
If you boys attempt to conquer
What I conquered, I'ma run you off the block
And hit your homie
Cause this clip here hold a hundred
Gun long as a gila monster
'90, was a Fila monster
And Gucci Mane gon' keep a strap
Show 

[?] just like it's 

[?] summer

[Hook]
If you want some, come get some, baby, cause there's plenty mo', you can get some of this shit
If you want some, you can get some, baby, come getcha some, cause there's plenty mo' of this shit
If you want some, come get some, baby, cause you want some, yeah, get you some of this shit
If you want some, come get some, baby, cause there's plenty mo', you can get you some of this shit
If you want some, you can get some, baby, come get you some, cause there's plenty mo' of this shit
If you want some, come get some, baby, cause you want some, yeah, get some of this shit
If you want some, come get some, cause there plenty mo', got plenty mo' of this shit
Pl-Plenty mo', plenty mo' of this shit
Got plenty mo', got plenty mo' of this shit

[Verse 2]
I drop ashes, so careless
And these pants came from Paris
Your boyfriend's embarrassed
She felt the fabric, she 

[?]
I'm spending broccoli for carats
I'm in Versace, shoppin'
Niggas pocket-watchin', they starin'
And I'm a step up on fashion
Got these three months in advance
They feel the fabric I'm wearin'
These pants I got come from Paris
I make your man feel embarrassed
Don't speak in Frank, I'm in France
Black patent leather, 

[?]
I'm droppin' ashes on 

[?]

[Hook]

[Chorus]
Go for it, go for it
Tell her somethin' good
That ho, she go for it
Go for it, go for it
See me in the club
Shorty go for it
Go for it, go for it
Got waves in my fade
Need a surfboard
Go for it, go for it
Take fifty to the mall
Let you go for it

[Verse 1]
Swag jumped overboard
Call the coast guard
Yellow, black Ferrari
Pull up in my Landshark
Yeah, my homies got more tools than a BrandsMart
Have 'em knockin' on your door like your landlord
Question of the day: What car are you gonna drive today?
Money's not a problem, I'm booked up 'till the month of May
Million dollar man, call me Gucci Dibiase
Every week, come to the mall, rein'-up Versace
So if you hatin' on Gucci Mane, gon' and get in line
No matter what you drivin', don't park your car next to mine
And if you can't see all these diamonds, then you colorblind
Looked at my watch to check the time, it told me "time to shine"

[Chorus]
Go for it, go for it
Tell her somethin' good
That ho, she go for it
Go for it, go for it
See me in the club
Shorty go for it
Go for it, go for it
Got waves in my fade
Need a surfboard
Go for it, go for it
Take fifty to the mall
Let you go for it

[Verse 2]
I tell her somethin' slick, hope that she go for it
She wanna get with Gucci, and we both know it
Smoke so much kush that I need a 'dro card
Sell so much coke that I got a snow award
Hit the car lot like "Fuck that shit, give me two of these"
Then, dropped the top late night to feel the summer breeze
I got her sellin' blow for me, no time
It's like I stuck my dick in a gold mine
Red bottom shoes, and they match the red Chevy
I'm the quarterback, I might just throw a Hail Mary
Gucci Mane, you know I pull a flea flicker
You industry, nigga
I'm in the streets, nigga

[Chorus]
Go for it, go for it
Tell her somethin' good
That ho, she go for it
Go for it, go for it
See me in the club
Shorty go for it
Go for it, go for it
Got waves in my fade
Need a surfboard
Go for it, go for it
Take fifty to the mall
Let you go for it

[Verse 3]
My money startin' to stand like an ant pile
I'm all about my grands like a grandchild
Show my ass like I got my pants down
All my fans say that I'm the man, hands down
Diamonds dancin' on my hand, do the James Brown
Smokin' kush straight out the pound, I need to change towns
'Rari crawlin' down the street like a centipede
Ballin' like I'm in the league, but I'm not in the league
Got Jamaicans, and they cut that weed down by the tree
Fuck who it profit if that shit don't profit me
26's got the donk lookin' like it got hydraulics
So, if you ain't talkin' money, nigga, change the topic

[Chorus]
Go for it, go for it
Tell her somethin' good
That ho, she go for it
Go for it, go for it
See me in the club
Shorty go for it
Go for it, go for it
Got waves in my fade
Need a surfboard
Go for it, go for it
Take fifty to the mall
Let you go for it

[Hook]
I sit around in the with my young niggas
Sellin' narcotics
Boys in the hood, wanna see a dead body?
Fuck 12, cause a nigga got a 12-gauge shotty
And I heard Vicky boy just shot somebody
Rude boy, tote a 

[?] with the bumbaclot
Rasclat  better run, cause Im lookin sharp
Head shot, pop pop pop pop pop to your dreadlock
And I drop the informant who talk to the damn cops

[Verse 1]
I'm a soldier on the battlefield
I murk your ass for real
Got a young nigga who love to kill
More bodies than a Navy Seal
These young boys ain't got nothin' to do
But somethin' to prove and somethin' to shoot
Kill you on you birthday
Take you cake, and fuck your lady too
Shoot you in your dreads
Now, have a Rastafarian funeral
"

[?] is a traitor" she said to his 

[?]
Hundred wawa's, all with woppers
Ain't no fucking breathing room
18 karat golden choppa my hollow tip got diamonds (burr)
Extended clip I dipped my clip in rose gold, so it match my jewelry, fool
"Gucci Mane got stupid money, but that boy ain't lyrical"
I'm Eazy-E, reincarnated, but without the Jheri curl (R.I.P.)
Without the Dre Beats on my ear
And ice cubes on my baby girl

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Here's you a little tip
Gucci Mane a miracle
Call me anything but lyrical
The shit gonna get physical

[?] on your bitch ass
I fucked her in the living room
She tried to get you to rob the wop now the bitch in critical
Short, fine
Big butt, with a fat purse

[?] nine, show time
Make that gat burst
I don't mind
But, don't touch it 'till you ask first
My new chick
She'll eat a dick like a bratwurst

[?]
I sip the lean
Pancake, Mrs. Butterworth
100K on three whips, that's a T-rex
100 pounds, I didn't pay
I got a weed debt

Bring some bitches to the crib, show 'em what the wood is
Your bitch look like Sheneneh, uh-uh, oh my goodness
It's 500, that be the block
Then you see that ghetto bird when you hear the shots
Where the plug at? Tell him meet me at the docks
Sent the little homie through, it might be the cops
Hol' up, I'm gettin' money, boy
Your girl want me 'cause I got them toys
'Raris and the Bentleys and Aventadors
Double-decker buses and them private jets, I spend it on
Painted on the Maserati, look like it been shitted on
Make her lift her skirt up, if she nervous, I'm a pervert
I be in that pussy deep, a nigga fuckin' up her cervix
Leave the condoms on the bed, man, I do that shit on purpose
'Cause I hope a nigga see it when he comin' home from work

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Shawty wanna leave with a nigga, I bet (Yeah)
Because she wanna be on TV with a nigga (With a nigga), I bet (Haha)
Bet you never thought that she would cheat on you, nigga, I bet
Don't be mad at me, I pull that chopper out and squeeze on you niggas
No sympathy for you niggas

[Verse 2: Tyga]
I-I-I got a hunnid on it (Ha)
She ain't faithful to you, nigga (Nah)
Word around town, you know thots get around
Nah, she testify, wouldn't trust her, homie (Homie)
I give a fuck what you know, makes no sense, you ho
Rolls gas, Royce pedal, pockets on roseo
R-Rosetta, my stones ain't meant for the home, bitch
So comfortable, now get your ass off my couch, bitch
Bounce shit, mouse shit, put in your mouth shit
I've been playin' with the pussy, time to put that thing in
Bang it, I'm bangin', my binger off safety
I'm slayin', she taste it, she swallowed, she's wasted (Ah)
F-Fuckin' amazin', pump out that bass like freebasin'
It's a rough demonstration, the mileage, replace it (Cyeah)
Come again, I replay it (Cyeah)
Speed it up, I'm speed racer (Cyeah)
Bet if you catch her lyin', she gon' reverse it 'cause

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Tyga & 50 Cent]
Shawty wanna leave with a nigga (Ha), I bet
(Yeah, got your ass, bitch)
'Cause she wanna be on TV with a nigga (Whoop), I bet (Ha)
Bet you never thought that she would cheat on you, nigga, I bet
Don't be mad at me, I pull that chopper out and squeeze on you niggas (Yeah)
No sympathy for you nigga (50)

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
I bet your bitch'll be ready when I say I'm finna leave
We only fuck with the foreigns, Ferrari horse on them keys
You be that nigga she call on when she need someone to love
I be that nigga, we just turn up, we just spoiled havin' fun (Ow!)
After the strokin', I be nuttin' in her mouth like this
And you come home like, "Honey, I'm home, come and give me kiss" (Haha)
It's not a thing for me, really not a thing for me
We from different sets, why your bitch wanna bang with me?
All the time, all the time, I be on the grind
Hoes look at me, the dollar signs run across they mind
It's the paper, they know a nigga get it, get it
Shawty gon' be with it, let a nigga get it, hold up in it

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Shawty wanna leave with a nigga, I bet (Yeah)
Because she wanna be on TV with a nigga (With a nigga), I bet (Haha)
Bet you never thought that she would cheat on you, nigga, I bet
Don't be mad at me, I pull that chopper out and squeeze on you niggas
No sympathy for you niggas

[Outro: K. Michelle]
Y'all bitchass niggas got me fucked up. I'm not fuckin' y'all niggas. I don't give a fuck who y'all is. And I don't give a fuck if you Chris Brown or Tyga. And y'all not givin' me my coin. I wanna be on TV, I wanna be on Love and Hip Hop, on Hollywood and shit. Don't get it fucked up

[Verse 1]
I let you fall asleep on the floor
Nothing's on so I'll just ignore
Don't bother to wake me up
You said nothing's worse than leaving a dream

No one gets me more than you
What is it you want to do?
Let's go outside to the green

[Hook]
We've got all we want
There's no place to go
There's only one (there's only one)
Something's wrong (something's wrong)

[Verse 2]
I'd only go if we got in for free
Counted the rows, I hope you're right by me
You shut your eyes while I look at the sky
Then you ask, "How long was the flight?"

[Hook]
We've got all we want
There's no place to go
There's only one (there's only one)
Something's wrong (something's wrong)
We've got all we want (all we want)
There's no place to go (place to go)
There's only one! (only one)
Oh, something's wrong! (something's wrong)

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Feel the adrenaline moving under my skin
It's an addiction, such an eruption
Sound is my remedy, feeding me energy
Music is all I need

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
Baby, I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
I don't really care, care, care
(You can feel it in the air, yeah)

[Chorus: Rihanna]
She's been a crazy Dita
Disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Back on the dance floor, bad enough to take me home
Bass kicking so hard, blazing through my beating heart
French kissing on the floor, heart is beating hardcore
Heard everybody is getting a little sexy off the Crazy Juice
This will end up on the news

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
Baby, I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
I don't really care, care, care
(You can feel it in the air, yeah)

[Chorus: Rihanna]
She's been a crazy Dita
Disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Ultra sexual
The night has got me love sprung
I won't stop until the sun is up, oh yeah
My heart is a dancer, beating like a disco drum
(Oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh-oh)
Ultra sexual
The night has got me love sprung
I won't stop until the sun is up, oh yeah
My heart is a dancer, beating like a disco drum
Beating like a disco drum
(Beating like a disco drum)
Beating like a disco drum

[Chorus: Rihanna]
She's been a crazy Dita
Disco diva and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?

[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
Maybe there's a reason why we broke up
I could dedicate my life to something new
But I must have been asleep but then I woke up
Working out why I was still with you
All the things I wish I could have been

[Chorus: Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb]
Wouldn't I be someone, someone
And I would be respected
In the prime of my life, I'll do everything right
I'll begin
Wouldn't I be something, something
I would get a reputation
In the prime of my life, I'll do everything right
I'll begin

[Verse 2:Robin Gibb]
Midnight stars are shining on my shoeshine
Telling me the things I'm gonna be
Now the hurts all gone, I've pushed them all behind me
And the world is gonna fall in love with me
All the things I wish I could have been

[Chorus: Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb]

[Chorus]
How come we don’t touch?
Where’s our love, am I what you want?
I recall it might be my fault
It’s never too hard
I wanna breathe

[Verse 1]
She got me vexed
I guess that’s how it is when you tie the not
‘Cause all my niggas in similar situation say you out to be happy that you still talk
But can you be happy and still want it
Can you hold back in the big front
I’m tryina be good but I’m still young
The balance of the stallion and the lion
For one wants to run free, the other’s always hungry
Don’t get me started on the flesh
The self-control to stay away from chicken breast has never been a test
But there is something in a sundress
Thick legs, small waist, fat ass, cute face
I could throw this all away and will he blow it on the wind
I escape by the hair on my chin, not today
But every day’s a struggle and I don’t know if I want to
Do know that I love you and what we created is amazing
Only word that comes to you â€“ beyond patient
Me? Crazier than ape shit
Shit, never want you to fake it but every once in a while I deserve to dick you down
I put the papers on the permit
I could’ve blow it on a thorny young K town
Might’ve been worth it

[Chorus]
How come we don’t touch?
Where’s our love, am I what you want?
I recall it might be my fault
It’s never too hard
I wanna breathe

[Verse 2]
I’m getting careless now
Fuck around and caught me texting these bitches
I ain’t had sex in a minute
Flirting, fucking the mind is like the closest thing I get to have to intercourse this time
And of course I wanna stay true but I’m battling it, I just hope you can handle it
‘Cause honestly I’ll never know another
I don’t even wanna fathom me, just wanna touch
Let me give you massage, you know I’m nicer with palms, too hard?
Ok, I do it soft, hold it, baby, you stressed, just cool off
You need some wine or something?
You need some soft lights?
Can I rub some chamomile lotion on your mosquito bites?
Anything that’ll give me, sending me to the light
I keep the faith that one day that you just might
Just might, just might

[Chorus]
How come we don’t touch?
Where’s our love, am I what you want?
I recall it might be my fault
It’s never too hard
I wanna breathe

I don't know

[Verse 1]
The falling leaves
Drift by the window
The autumn leaves
Of red and gold

[Verse 2]
I see your lips
The summer kisses
The sunburned hands
I used to hold

[Verse 3]
Since you went away
The days grow long
And soon I'll hear
Old winter's song

[Verse 4]
But I miss you most of all
My darling
When autumn leaves
Start to fall
I'm a fool to want you
I'm a fool to want you
To want a love that can't be true
A love that's there for others too

I'm a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you
To seek a kiss, not mine alone
To share a kiss that the devil has known

Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come a time when I would need you
And once again these words I'll have to say

I'm a fool to want you
Pity me, I need you
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong
But right or wrong, I can't get along without you

Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come a time when I would need you
And once again these words I'll have to say
Take me back, I love you
Pity me, I need you
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong
But right or wrong, I can't get along without you

[Verse 1]
There was a moon out in space
But a cloud drifted over its face
You kissed me and went on your way
The night we called it a day
I heard the song of the spheres
Like a minor lament in my ears
I hadn't the heart left to pray
The night we called it a day

[Verse 2]
Soft through the dark
The hoot of an owl in the sky
Sad though his song
No bluer than he was I
The moon went down, stars were gone
But the sun didn't rise with the dawn
There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day

[Verse 3]
Soft through the dark
The hoot of an owl in the sky
Sad though his song
No bluer than he was I
The moon went down, stars were gone
But the sun didn't rise with the dawn
There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day
Full moon and empty arms
The moon is there for us to share
But where are you?
A night like this could weave a memory
And every kiss could start a dream for two

Full moon and empty arms
Tonight I'll use the magic moon to wish upon
And next full moon
If my one wish comes true
My empty arms will be filled with you
Where are you, where have you gone without me
I thought you cared about me, where are you
Where's my heart, where is the dream we started
I can't believe we're parted, where are you

When we said, goodbye, love, what had we to gain
When I gave you my love, was it all in vain
All life through, must I go on pretending
Where is my happy ending, where are you

When we said, goodbye, love, what had we to gain
When I gave you my love, was it all in vain
All life through, must I go on pretending
Where is that happy ending, where are you, where are you
What'll I do?
When you are far away
And I am blue
What'll I do?

What'll I do?
When I am wondering who
Is kissing you
What'll I do?

What'll I do with just a photograph
To tell my troubles to?

When I'm alone
With only dreams of you
That won't come true
What'll I do?

[instrumental-one verse]

What'll I do with just a photograph
To tell my troubles to?
When I'm alone
With only dreams of you
That won't come true
What'll I do?

[Verse 1]
Up in the mornin', out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll 'round heaven all day

[Verse 2]
Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
Sweat 'til I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
But roll 'round heaven all day

[Verse 3]
Good Lord above, can't you see I'm pining, tears in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to Paradise
Show me that river, take me across, and wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do, but roll 'round heaven all day

[Verse 4]
Oh Lord above can't you know I'm pining, tears in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to Paradise
Show me that river, take me across, and wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do, but roll 'round heaven all day

[Intro]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dear Lord, can you take it away? (Ooh)
This pain in my heart that just follows me by day (Yeah)
And at night, it stalks me like the shadows on my wall (Mm)
Oh my goodness

[Verse 1]
Feel like the world is closing on me
Feel like my dreams will never come to me
I keep on slippin' deeper into myself
And I'm scared, so scared

[Chorus]
If you're troubled
You just gotta let it go (Ah)
If you're worried, baby
You just gotta let it go
All your hustles ain't for nothing
You just gotta take it slow
When you need me, baby
All you do is let me know

[Verse 2]
Why does it feel
That my mind is constantly trying to pull me down?
I can't seem to get away
Continuous mistakes I know I've made before
How long will I feel so out of place?

[Chorus]
If you're troubled
You just gotta let it go (You got to let it go)
If you're worried, baby (Oh)
You just gotta let it go (I know, I know)
All your hustles ain't for nothing
You just gotta take it slow
When you need me, baby
All you do is let me know

[Bridge]
Yeah
I know I like you now
Can't stop, mmm

[Chorus]
If you're troubled
You just gotta let it go (You got to let it go)
If you're worried, baby
You just gotta let it go (Don't you worry)
All your hustles ain't for nothing (Don't you worry, no, no)
You just gotta take it slow
When you need me, baby
All you do is let me know (You got to let me know)
If you're troubled (Are you troubled?)
You just gotta let it go (Are you troubled?)
If you're worried, baby (Are you worried?)
You just gotta let it go (Are you worried?)
All your hustles ain't for nothing (But you're a hustler)
You just gotta take it slow (You're a hustler)
When you need me, baby (You're a)
All you do is let me know (Oh)
If you're troubled (Oh)
You just gotta let it go (Let it go)
If you're worried, baby
You just gotta let it go (Mmm)
All your hustles ain't for nothing (You're a hustler)
You just gotta take it slow
When you need me, baby (Don't you worry)
All you do is let me know ('Cause I will run, yes, I will run)
If you're troubled (Don't you worry)
You just gotta let it go ('Cause I will run)
And if you're worried, baby
You just gotta let it go (Woo)
All your hustles ain't for nothing
You just gotta take it slow (You just gotta take it slow)
When you need me, baby
All you do is let me know

[Outro]
Oh
'Cause I will run to you
You, you don't have to worry
Amen

[Verse 1]
Fuck, watch how I kill 'em with the funky rhythm
I'll bomb if you don't feel 'em, piranhas in 'em
Feed my persona as I get deep as Nostradamus
No stallin' like the 

[inaudible], nuh-uh, 

[inaudible]
I'm ballin', cut up your pajamas if you're sleepin' on me
No promise, no peekin', homie
You're tryin' to confiscate the flow, I know
So I switch it quicker than my bitches
If they want your attention
One thing for sure, they gon' get it
I'm cursed with the world's negatives
Probably thinkin' I'm hurt, but that's the only way I can live
War, money, cash, drugs, got me feelin' like AIDS
Walkin' inside the club
Paid in full, it more be like 

[inaudible]
.38 snub huggin' my waist like it had arms
Then I bear it, so I guess it really does
No paperwork on this marriage
He love when life 

[inaudible] better than life

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Drunk off Paul, nigga, pourin' by the Rover, bitches
Pourin' hollows over haters, we killin' insecure niggas
Feelin' like the old Jigga, old Nas, old Big, new 'Pac
Oh my God, he's alive, he dropped bombs on you intellects
Bombin' everythin' from the streets to the Internet
Hear the instrumental wet
Then I'm a bust a nut, yep, I'm a fuckin' nut
That is not an Escalade, that's a damn armored truck
Shoot who? Shot what?
You ain't popped shit but some bubblegum and a bump
Who you motherfuckers want?
Leave a motherfucker slumped from the fuckin' pump
He's a peanut to an elephant, put that nigga in a trunk
Might be out in Houston, lean in my pimp cup
Ride in '84s, throwed like a shot put
Hoes on my jock like I'm from the ATL
In our new block, choppers on the rooftop
Flip a nigga like he was a NBA mascot
Strip a nigga from his Wade cap to his two socks
Got it from them Compton blocks
Raised from my grandpa's
Every day, caught a fade like we like we own the barber shop
Goons in the parkin' lot
Who are you to fool if you bark a lot with no bite like an iguana
Get killed right in front of your momma
Hold tight, coroner comin'
Summertime, perfect time for dove huntin'
And you a woman want to be at my house with her ass out
She climaxed and passed out
And promotional flyers, K-Dot be the flyest
Eat ten rappers a day, that's a hell of a diet
Straight up like a kangaroo
Pumpin' like a fist do from a pro-black
This is automatic rap, made a minute, take a second
I'm a get it maybe here for a minute when I'm finished
Let's begin it

[Intro]
(But all I wanna know, baby, is)
(If what we have is good) Oh, whoa, oh, oh
(Just pick up the motherfuckin' phone, damn)
Yeah, baby

[Verse 1]
I keep your picture beside my bed
And I still remember everything you said
I always thought our love was so right, I guess I was wrong
Always thought you'd be by my side, papa, now you're gone
(And I'm not tryna hear that shit)

[Chorus]
What I wanna know, baby
If what we had was good
How come you don't call me anymore?

[Verse 2]
Still light the fire on a rainy night
I still like it better when you're holding me tight (You know, yeah)
Everybody said
Everybody said that we should never part (Mmm, oh no)
Tell me baby, baby, baby, why
Why you wanna go and break my heart? Hey, ooh

[Chorus]
All I wanna know is, baby
If what we had was good
How come you don't call me anymore? Oh, hey (Hey)

[Bridge]
(You know what?)
Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
If you don't call me, papa
Ooh, you got to try
I'll get down on my knees
Hoping you please, please
Oh-oh, ooh, won't you call me sometime, papa?
(You know it's just one lousy quarter)
(Why don't you call me anymore?)

[Outro]
Why on Earth
Can't you just pick up the phone?
You know I don't like to be alone
How come you don't call me? (Why must you torture me?)
How come you don't call me? (Hey, hey)
How come you don't call me? (Oh, call me sometime, baby)
Hello, my goodness
I didn't know I was here

Do you know my name? (Can't go wrong when you try)
Always got to try
No matter how long that shit take
Yeah, yeah
Whatever stops you from dreaming
Whatever tries to stop you from living
Flip it

Welcome home
'Cause right now what I have to do
Is I gotta amp myself up as well as you
So, yeah, so what it took me like
Maybe two years and shit
But I'm feeling prepared
You know what I'm saying?
And I'm feeling a little more ready for the world
And less lost
As I once was
So come on
What you waiting on?
Feel me, feel me, feel me
What? Uh, yeah
What? Uh, yeah
What?

[Verse 1]
Oakland and 2Pac
I move oak, you see, I'm nothin' like 

[inaudible]
Thinkin' they hot cause they homies said they was a few times
Which is too many times of lyin' to you, they tellin' a lie
The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it
Record twenty-four hours, these niggas better get they bars up
I bench press this rap stuff
Got it locked like handcuffs, I threw away the key
My cool is on, she love my AC
My jewels is on and I wish one of y'all'd try ride me
I shoot and have you land between the sheets with the Isleys
We push the coupe like a 

[inaudible]
The helicopter's comin', realize there's nothin' behind us
Behind me, Your Honor
I fuck over these beats with no condom
This ain't rap, it's really a porno, rewind it back

[Inaudible], it's back to definin' a loss, correct, they don't obey
Y'all ain't nice, nigga, y'all just okay
Yeah, they're more than a little 

[inaudible]
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, modern-day Isaac Hayes

[Inaudible] equivalent to the theme song of your career
Study my craft, you ignorant
I do it without a pen and a pad, just inspiration
Somethin' y'all never had
If my pockets is somethin' you tryin' to grab
See, I pulled out the rocket and peel you back like scab
You old news, old dudes, get out my way
Let the young boy come through, don't mention my age
Shit, I'm on a mission for pay
And you astronaut niggas just crowd in my space
Look, you're not in my atmosphere
You can act like you're here
But actually you ain't accurate fuckin' with this music biz
The industry like, 'Fuck it, let the music be his'
No theme park, I'm not tryin' to amuse you kids
Small shark, Jaws is here, jump in the water
Do we really fuck with President Carter?
My reply's that I can't stay away from the bosses
Got the biddin' war poppin' like a auction
Five or ten labels like, 'What he hatin' for?'
Except the zeros and more
Remember havin' Aftermath sittin' on my door
Money in front of me, I couldn't open the door

[Verse 2]
I'm so far ahead of my time
I got people five years from now pressin' rewind
I'm hardly impressed with y'all
I hate rappers, where the true artists at?
If it ain't a good picture you draw, don't bring it to the architect
Often y'all arguin' about who got next
Claimin' y'all runnin' the game, niggas is barely walkin' yet
Hoppin' all over beats without going through trainin' camp
Try studyin' a few greats, then maybe you'll be where I'm at
Your songwritin' ain't great, your mixtapes' medioc'
You recycle the same quotes, you're not switchin' your flow
Your flow in the same place
Don't just 

[inaudible], expand
Try to be more creative, perhaps
My rap friends, I ain't sayin' that you wack, psych
Like a invoice, I'm just statin' the facts, right?
You'd have to count the metaphors I write
In fact, you've been a factor you've feared your whole life
No TV show, don't compare me with them
That's like Jaws versus Nemo, a gorilla to a chimp
A Jordan versus Kukoč
A Tony Montana with blow in his nose to a Nino

[Verse 1]
There's no escape on the spell you have placed
Leaving my heart and my mind
Foolish am I, if I was to try
To ever leave you behind

[Chorus]
I wanna rock wit' you, come give me all your love
No matter what we do, I wanna rock wit' you
Wit' you and only you, I wanna rock wit' you
I wanna rock wit' you, rock wit' you, baby

[Verse 2]
I'll stay and walk this life wit' you
No matter what we may go through
Dead broke, no job, no house, no ride
I'm gonna stay right by your side

[Chorus]
I wanna rock wit' you, come give me all your love
No matter what we do, wanna rock wit' you
Wit' you and only you, wit' you and only you
I wanna rock wit' you, rock wit' you, baby, baby

[Bridge]
Don't question where you're headed to, my love
Don't be (Don't be) afraid, just believe in love

[Chorus]
I wanna rock wit' you, no matter what we do
Wit' you and only you, I wanna rock wit' you
I wanna rock wit' you (Wanna rock wit' you baby)
No matter what we do (Wanna rock wit' you baby)
Wit' you and only you (Wanna rock wit' you baby)
I wanna rock wit' you (Wanna rock wit' you baby)
I wanna rock wit' you (Wanna rock wit' you baby)
No matter what we do (They know who, this posess')
Wit' you and only you (Wanna rock wit' you baby)
I'm gonna rock wit' you (Moral is, no more less)

[Outro]
(Hey)
Do your thing, do your thing (Hey, hey)
Do your thing, do your thing
Do your thing, do your thing
Do your thing, do your thing
Do your thing, do your thing
Do your thing, do your thing
(Do your thing, do your thing)
Do your thing, do your thing
(Do your thing, do your thing)
Do your thing, do your thing
Do your thing, do your thing
Mmm
Do your thing, do your thing (Hey, hey)
(Do your thing, do your thing)
(Do your thing, do your thing)

[Verse 1]
Live from the area code of 310
Carry the whole city on my back
Knapsack full of goodies, black hoodie, 

[inaudible]
Fully detach bullets from their own egos, see no evil
Who the hottest out? I'm a give 'em a heat stroke
Summertime, wearin' a peacoat
I be the baddest to ever put a lyric on top of an apparatus
Now trip, that's our flip, I'm a savage
Fabulous wordplay
And you can get served every day without a in-house maid
Be very afraid, I'm nasty with it
Born out the ass of a dragon, flamin', shitted on the masses
This harassment came from Kendrick, givin' out caskets
Puttin' these rappers in it, you fit the image of a dead man
Hennessy and chronic in the same night, so what?
Eyes red like a twelve o'clock fight

[Intro: Alicia Keys]
So, that's why we're just here alone
Ooh, hmm
Can tell you 'bout woman, woman
Can tell you 'bout a woman

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
You can buy me diamonds and buy me pearls
Take me on a cruise around the world
A dozen roses 'cause I'm your girl
And you know I'm worth it (Uh-huh), I'm worth it
Dinner lit by candles under the sun
Run my bubble bath 'cause I'm the one
You want to love so tenderly
And you know I'm worth it (Say what?), I'm worth it

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Wanna please, wanna keep, wanna treat your woman right (Right)
Not just dough, better show that you know she is worth your time (Time)
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first (First)
She will find a man who knows her worth (Ooh)

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
So all my real women, throw your hands up
All my real men, wave your hands
If you feel me, get off your ass
If you're worth it, worth it
So all my real women, throw your hands up
All my real men, wave your hands
All my peoples who understand
Represent your woman, your woman, your woman, your woman, your woman's worth

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
'Cause if you treat me fairly, I'll give you my goods
Show you all the things no one else would
Treat you like a real woman should
'Cause I know you're worth it (Say what?), you're worth it
If you never play me, no, don't you bluff
I promise you can get it all
I'll hold you down when shit gets rough
'Cause I know you're worth it (Say what?), you're worth it

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
She walks the mile, makes you smile, all the while being true (True)
Don't take for granted the passion she has for you (You)
If you choose to refuse, you will lose, put her first (First)
She will find a man who knows her worth (Oh)

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
So all my real women, throw your hands up
All my real men, wave your hands (Oh)
If you feel me, get off your ass (Get off your ass)
If you're worth it (If you're worth it now), worth it (Oh)
So all my real women, throw your hands up (Oh)
All my real men, wave your hands
All my peoples who understand (Represent her now)
Represent your woman, your woman, your woman, your woman, your woman's worth

[Verse 3: Nas & Alicia Keys]
It's like I'm Rikers and you the island, we stuck together until the verdict
Big dreams in tiny windows, trapped behind bars, your love is murder
And I'd die just to come back as an angel and look over you
'Cause I know what the most high got planned for us, more than mostly true
I stay close to you, spray clips, empty fifty at anybody, it's nothing
Many women that try me, none of them the wifey type, but they looking for a husband
I guess that's what they 'posed to do
But I'm good, I'ma toast to you
'Cause you with me in the trenches
So why I gotta cheat when I got a freak at home? She my queen and my ho and my mistress
And she know how to split the Dutch up, break the green up, roll up the leaf and clean up
Drive while I ride on enemies, rock the wheel with one hand and blow the heater
She a bad motherfucker, hot to death, so you know that I need her
If you know you're a bad bitch, put your hands up to this jam by Nas and Alicia, yeah (Oh, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Nas]
All my real women, throw your hands up (Said, throw your hands up)
All my real men, wave your hands (Put 'em up)
If you feel me, get off your ass (All my real women)
If you're worth it (If you're worth it), worth it
So all my real women (Krucial Keys), throw your hands up (All the ladies, ladies, ladies, all the real)
All my real men (Bravehearts), wave your hands (Said, wave your hands, Nas)
All my peoples (Uh) who understand (If you understand 'bout your woman)
Represent your woman, your woman, your woman, your woman, your woman's worth

[Intro]
Haa
It's Guwop
What's happenin' nigga
Roger turn up nigga

[Hook]
A hundred bricks, cartel talk
A thousand pints, cartel talk
A mean pills, cartel talk
I trap for real, cartel talk
Cartel talk (6x)

[Verse 1]
I was trappin' like a cartel
Started out trappin' at the hotel
Whole sale, retail, sellin' fish scales
Under scale, bricks and bells I'm the man
Look at me and look at Rodger Beat
Look at them and look at him, no sir
I think I'm Pablo, John Gotti, El Chapo
Head honcho, they say that all my goons local
Cartel talkin', I'm on the phone with the plug
Finesse often, I tricked them out a lot of drugs
Boss ballin', you short stoppin', candy loftin'
No crossover make you fade away like Michael Jordan
Beatin' that pussy, I'm Kimbo Slice I'm shawty daughter
Like bottle water, put that 40 on your 

[?]
Cartel talk, dope dance a moon walk
I'm fresh as hell, skate gear Tony Hawkin'

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
All that ass, Lord have mercy
All that champagne, these bitches thirsty
Verserchy, no hold up, I meant Versace
I prolly pull up Roberto over Cavalli
Puffin' on Cali, prolly out in the valley
Sippin' on something drowsy, bitches twerkin' like Miley
Twerk, twerk for a real nigga sellin' work
Promise I won't tell a word
I been on that trill shit, way back
North Philly nigga, but I'm laid back
Get shot in your head drivin' your Maybach
Homey D Clown know I don't play that
Sippin' dirty, riding dirty, I say hi to thirty
Call your dog,  I call my dawg and he'll buy a birdy
Try to school me, I'm getting out here early
Dope dealer, Puma life, back of this soccer jersey
Mink draggin', tell PETA I'm swaggin
All these karats like I'm tryna lure in a rabbit (Dag!)
Just to put it (Put it where?) On my jacket (On my jacket)
(What they askin?) What you doin? (What you doin?) Doin' fashion

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Okay, I walk with a limp and I talk with a slur
I might wear every single chain and mix it up with my fur
I might get every single drink and mix it up til I blur
I tell the bitch get on my lap, but don't you get on my nerves
I need that bag full of green like a lawnmower
John Doe and all Sean Doe it, and I keep it G
Yeah, I ground floor it, and I'm pound blowin'
If her pussy good then I might one, two, three, round four it
Got her down for it
Yeah, nigga overthink, never under stress
Yeah, I understand, your girl over, I'm so unimpressed
Yeah, and she tryna fuck me raw, unprotect
But if I don't have that rubber on it I feel under dressed
Yeah, and I got money bags under my eyes, ho, cause I ain't sleep
They all Goyard too cause I ain't cheap
Finally Famous Aura Gold is my I-N-C
And I put everything in motion like I-N-G
And when we flyin' private you could bring the gun on with us
I got this freak to 3rd base, she tryna run home with us
And I got comma on comma on comma on comma... on comma
And I ain't talking about no run on sentence
Yeah, nigga hot headed so I need that Chings Chili
Put my P up on her head like that bitch is reppin' Philly
And I wheelie in that pussy like my nigga Meek Milly
On my way to meet millis
Lawyer drafting up the deep deep dealies
I got rich decided that ain't rich enough
When I did it big, bitch, I decided that ain't big enough
Dead Pres, who you diggin up?
Who that nigga that you hating on, but just  can't get enough?
Fuck, the jig is up, little bitch

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
I'm like Madoff but I made off, scheming on niggas' payoff
I never take a day off, your stash is short like Adolf, Hitler
You should lay off on the gangsta talk cause you're fake, dog
You never pushed no yay, dawg, ain't see no keys like Ray Charles
Me and Meek in the Maybach, we get Wale and take off
We got your bitch in a big house, she walk in hype like "Hey, Ross, how you doing?"
Get with a dreamchaser, we ballin' hard like the Lakers
You ballin' out, you a faker, you prolly catchin' the vapors
I'm at your house on the hill, I fucked your girl and your neighbor
You thinkin' Khloe don't know me, I'm in the car dashin' haters
I'm in the Kardashian, get it? I'm lyin', can't I pretend?
They say fake it 'til you make it, well, let the fakin' begin
I got a bitch with fake titties, fake ass, she all in the Benz
Them titties'll prolly fall like a ball when she bend
My niggas from Harlem and Philly all get it in
Your bitch come around then we fuckin' her and her friends
Come get with a dreamchaser, we ballin' hard like the Lakers
You ballin' out, you a faker, you prolly catchin' the vapors
Come get with a dreamchaser, we ballin' hard like the Lakers
You ballin' out, you a faker, you prolly catchin' the vapors
I'm at your house on the hill, I fucked your girl and your neighbor

[Outro: Meek Mill]

She, just, put, heart eyes under my pic nigga

Bought her a first class ticket to put the dick in her

[Intro: Drake & Big Sean]
Look
I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
(Straight... up)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay, I feel better at work
I mean, whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'ma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you "dog"
That shit get-get petty
Bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough
I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left that's still doing this shit, man

[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up ‘cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God, I hope they post it, I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled, I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school, a Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh, yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed

[Intro]
Yeah, follow me, uh

[Verse]
Picture Kendrick, one of the greatest emcees
Roamin' the coast like cellphones on airplane mode
I been at bat for so many years
Now I'm out swingin' like open marriages
Carry this terrorist flow, say that I'm arrogant
Stop playin', thinkin' back to rhymin' over computer mics
Knew I was tight the moment the speakers had broke
I dipped and dabbled in chronic, but never knew I was dope
You see, my uncles is killers, but never knew I could smoke
A rapper like a .357, do worse enemies
Was God-given, but now I'm God, hate to intervene
I sick a lyric on you like K-9's from the police
Let it rip through your briefs, till it bite through your culo
I'm Cujo, (you) sumo actor, (me) sumo rapper
Heavy in the game, follow my name, K-Dizzle
A twenty-two-year-old dream, got now
Like a person place or thing hands down like 6:30
You heard me? I'm a motherfuckin' problem, puto
Give me respect, I hold it down for DJBooth.net
And they tell 'em K-Dot got next
And they tell 'em K-Dot got necked
From your baby momma
On my momma, brain like a genius
I'm travelin' to Venus
Where aliens got pistols 'round they V-necks
Snub-nose, Kleenex
I suppose I done drove artists to a place
Where the daily deceased sleep at
Competition comin' up short like a dwarf
But, of course, I'm a short fuse ready to blow
Go 'head and put your gun down, we can go toe-to-toe
Mano e mano, you ain't ready, I'm deadly as plec disease
God-given, you trippin', I've walked the Seven Seas
Moses, cold as they heart, cloned as art
Foamin' at the mouth, wildebeest slaughter opponents
'Bout business when I kicks this, ridiculous symphony
Tick-tock, boom when you infants give me some room
Central and Rosecrans, Compton don't raise killers
They raise Conans with survival tactics
You love drama? Well, welcome to the land of theatrics
Even a preacher be packin' like role managers damage your goods
Cameras roll through the hood, tryin' to get that footage
Even newscasters come to your block when you wouldn't
This the city at it's best, have a seat, hold your breath
A breath of fresh air, DJBooth.net and Dot
Kendrick Lamar, K-Dot, that is, ha-ha-ha, ha, yeah

[Intro: Alicia Keys & Kandi Burruss]
Hey yo, Alicia
What's up, Kandi?
Man, these Jane Does be killing me thinking they're slick with it
For real
Drop the beat, uh
Alicia Keys (Uh, one, two, uh, one, two), Kandi, collabo, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
Let's talk about the situation
'Bout how you came with information
It's negative in every which way
Just dissing my man and our relations
You say he's cheating, want me to leave him
I've changed my mind, I think I'll keep him
Listening to you will leave me lonely
That's not what I'm trying to be

[Chorus: Kandi Burruss]
'Cause I'll be crazy (Crazy) to let my man go (Man go)
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him
Oh no, oh no
Just crazy (Crazy) to let my man go (Man go)
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him
Oh no, oh no

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys with Kandi Burruss]
See I, caught you trying to check my man out
How 'bout you 'plain what that's all about
Think you slick like I wouldn't know
But I got something for you, Doe
Mess around, end up in a choke hold
Girl, I think it's time for you to go
Away from my man and me
That's the way it's gonna be

[Chorus: Kandi Burruss & Alicia Keys]
'Cause I'll be crazy (Crazy) to let my man go (Man go)
And let some other Jane Doe (Jane Doe)
Come and try to steal him
Oh no, oh no (To steal him, no, no)
Just crazy (Crazy) to let my man go (My man go)
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him (No)
Oh no, oh no (No, no)

[Bridge: Alicia Keys & Kandi Burruss]
I love my man, he loves me more
He may not be the perfect man, but I don't plan to let him go for
Jane Doe (Jane Doe, Jane Doe, Jane Doe)
Oh (Jane Doe, Jane Doe)
(Jane Doe, Jane Doe, Jane Doe)

[Chorus: Kandi Burruss & Alicia Keys]
'Cause I'll be crazy (Crazy, crazy) to let my man go (Mmm, man go)
And let some other Jane Doe (Jane Doe)
Come and try to steal him (Try to steal him oh, no)
Oh no, oh no
Just crazy (I'd be crazy) to let my man go (My man go)
And let some other Jane Doe (Jane Doe)
Come and try to steal him
Oh no, oh no (Oh, no)
Crazy (Crazy) to let my man go (Man go)
And let some other Jane Doe (Jane Doe)
Come and try to steal him (Jane Doe)
Oh no, oh no
Just crazy to let my man go (Jane Doe, man go)
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him (No, no)
Oh no, oh no (No, no, no, no)

[Interlude: Kandi Burruss & Alicia Keys]
Jane Doe, Jane Doe (My man go)
Jane Doe, Jane Doe
Jane Doe, Jane Doe (Oh, the Jane Doe)
Jane Doe, Jane Doe, Jane Doe (Jane Doe can't have him, oh no)

[Chorus: Kandi Burruss & Alicia Keys]
'Cause I'll be crazy (Crazy, No) to let my man go (Man go)
And let some other Jane Doe (My man go)
Come and try to steal him (For no Jane Doe)
Oh no, oh no

And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him (No)

In the name of Jesus, let us pray

Father, we thank you for waking us up this morning
We thank you for surrounding us with your guardian angels as we slept
We thank you for waking our family, friends and loved ones as well
Keeping us safe
We thank you for waking our enemies this day, father, for they are your children, as we are

Lord I, Earl Simmons, stand in a gap for Jayceon Terrell Taylor
And pray that he is continued as a child of yours
He is continued in your grace
He is continued with the blessings that you bless so many others with
In the name of Jesus
We pray that any obstacle that the Devil plans to place in our path will be moved in the name of Jesus' father
Every spirit, everything that, of you that we come against right now, father
Every spirit of addiction
Every spirit of anger
Every spirit of jealousy
Every spirit of deception
Every spirit of greed
Every spirit of envy
Every spirit of lust we come against right now, in the name of Jesus' father
Let us say:
Devil! We rebuke you in the name of Jesus!
Devil! We rebuke you in the name of Jesus!
Devil! We rebuke you in the name of Jesus!
Devil! We rebuke you in the name of Jesus!
Devil! We rebuke you in the name of Jesus!
Devil! We rebuke you in the name of Jesus!
Devil! We rebuke you in the name of Jesus!

[DMX]
Father you give us power to speak the word father
You say we have but to ask with a sincere heart and it will be
So we thank you for this spoken word father
You say that when one or more come together in your name your presents will be felt
So we now only ask to feel your presents we need to feel your presents father
We thank you for the blessings you have given us this day
Things that people dont even realize that are blessings
The food you have given us to eat
The cars you have given us to drive
The clothes you have given us to wear
The money you have given us to spend
The lives you have allowed us to touch
And the lives that have touched our own
We thank you for all these things father in the name of jesus
We thank you again for the power of the spoken word
I pray that by the end of this day this word which is your word coming through my mouth
Will touch someone
And save someones life
In jesus mighty name I pray

I made somethin' outta nothing, I didn't have nothing to lose
I came up in the struggle, I had holes all in my shoes
Now my price so cheap that people think my connect from Peru
And my dope so fuckin' good, you can put 4 on a 2
So your deuce turned to six,  so an extra four for you
It's so clean, a Junky's dream, she thinks it's 1982
Jesús pull up, I pull up, then we pop trunks and switcharoo
Got that Tec-9 with the coo
And it might knock you out your shoes, Gucci

[Verse 1]
Back to the wall, back to the mall
Wednesday night, I'm back to Kamal's
Bussin' a blunt so I'm breaking the law
Run up on me and I'm breaking ya' jaw
Flippin' the raw, choppin' the car
Put my red bottles  on top of the bar
I'm dropping my top and she dropping her top
Let my roof back and she took off her bra
I raised these niggas like I was they pa'
Give me respect like I'm fuckin' ya' ma'
Brick Squad Records, you know who we are
Check it, respect it or take me to war
Slap you, dare you to take me to court
Take it in blood but I ain't takin' it short
Ain't gettin' paid then what is the point?
If you want mo' then come fuck with ya' boy
Million in cash, in back of the truck
Take your goons, your dick in the dust
Your hitman be whackin' for us
Got headless bodies in back of the bus
I talk big shit but I'm backin' it up
You stakin' and trappin', ain't trappin' for us?
Think you got us well I'll cut off your nuts and I run them through your body in back of the blood

[Verse 2]
I'm in Sun Valley in a dark alley
Tryna' keep balance in my New Balance
Competitions ain't no challenge, fourteen and I'm so managed
My migo friend but can't speak Spanish
Pressure on but I don't panic
Goin' H.A.M like a ham sandwich
Be calm, I know how to handle it
I vanish in a Vanquish, 50 thousand on these Sam Smith's
Hunnid grand in my pant's, countin' money's romantic
Keep a hunnid, can't handle it, they charge 10 dollars for dances
So I make her dance till' her legs cramp and the bitch said she can't stand me
There's so many fake asses, fuck it, I'mma just smash it
I can't tell if it's fake a or real no more, I think I need glasses
Anti-social, I'mma smoker, so I roll one and don't pass it
Call me Big Unc' when you see me cause I used to give dope to your daddy

[Intro]
Allons, viens encore, chérie
J'attendrai patiemment sous la lampe dans la vieille avenue

[Verse 1: Robin Gibb]
Then I may end
She had things to buy
I close my eyes
Yet I don't know why
I gave her money; said she knew someone
And she said she won't be long

[Chorus: Barry Gibb]
Lamplights keep on burning while this heart of mine is yearning
Lamplights keep on burning till this love of yours is mine

[Verse 2: Robin Gibb]
I sat alone with my thoughts and laughed
Then saw your face in an old photograph
I didn't think that I could live without you
But what am I to do?

[Chorus: Barry Gibb]
Lamplights keep on burning while this heart of mine is yearning
Lamplights keep on burning till this love of yours is mine

[Bridge]
Come home again dear
I have waited year after year
Under the lamp in our old avenue
If all in the world that's laughing
Why should it make us cry?
Ah...

[Hook: 2-D]
Starshine, never gonna find me
Starshine, they ain't gonna find me
Starshine, never gonna find me

Jumping up, I'm low, low, low, low
Show me down

Starshine, never gonna find me

How many mutha'uckas?
Too many to count, mutha'uckas

[Verse 1: Jemaine (Bret)]
I pay my mutha'uckin' rent fortnightly
Mutha'uckas at the bank trying to play me
An amount from my account goes out on A/P (on A/P!)
Yeah, you know me
Mutha'ucka charge a two buck transaction fee
Makes my payment short, my rent comes back to me
Minus a twenty-five dollar penalty
So you fee'd me cause of your mutha'uckin' fee!
Read the word on my ATM slip
Said, "We're all mutha'uckas
And we're 'uckin' with your shi'," come on!

[Hook: Bret & (Jemaine)]
Too many mutha'uckas

How many mutha'uckas?
Too many to count, mutha'uckas!

[Verse 2: Bret]
The mutha'ucka runs a racist 'uckin' grocery
The mutha'ucka won't sell an apple to a Kiwi
The shi' fight's gonna get vicious and malicious
Cut the cra' ...'sh'...' I need my Red Delicious
Tells me as a Kiwi that my money isn't valid
Gonna dice the mutha'ucka like a mutha'uckin' fruit salad
Then... sh'... Granny Smith... f'...

Damn her ass is so big

Shorty dancing like she knows
She's the baddest in the place (Hey, hey)
I wanna get with you (Freak, don't fail me now, hey)
So what you wanna do?
Got her Freak-Um dress on
Them New Bs on her feet
And them bottles with the sparkles
So the other girls can see that she's paid
I wanna get with you (Freak, don't fail me now, hey!)
So what you wanna do?

[Verse 1]
She too fly for words
And where I'm at now I'm too high for birds
Shorty, what you think about my return
Cuz what he think about it ain't my concern
I ain't come for you, I came for your Missus
I don't do it for the haters, I do it for the players
Well okay, I do it for the riches
But in the meantime and in-between time
Shorty right there gon' get it if she with it
If she ain't, then I know her partner down
Cuz her partner throwing shots every time I turn around
And her partner bringing partners every time I come to town
I'm a G6er, a Maybacher
You can tell the chauffeur he can park it right there
And I'ma walk up to the club upstairs
And when I come down he can bring it back, word

I came to cut right now
Bigg Snoop Dogg and I came to get down
Yes, I'm internationally known
Libra lovin' make you moan and groan
Burn my gas like race cars
Two bad broads with the bass on
I never met a girl that I'd wait for
I seal my deal like Jay does
All that and then some
Pimp real for real when I win some
I remember what you're thinking
Black shades on, drinking while you're blinking
Something fly, white limousine
Make a clean getaway
I loved your clothes, what you about
The way you let it out

How can you tell by looking at me?
How can you tell you like what you see?
Suddenly there's a boy in the rain alone
Suddenly there's a girl in the rain alone

[Verse 2: Maurice Gibb]
How can you tell humans are real?
How can you tell you like what you feel?
Suddenly there's a girl in your heart, oh boy
Suddenly there's a boy in your heart, oh boy

Ah...

Whisper, whisper, what have you got?
I've got something that you need a lot
Stop me and buy one
You can see better, but you better not
Listen, mister, can you help me?
It's my sister, show her how to fly
Stop me and try one
You can see everything blowing by

[Verse 2]
Whisper, whisper, keep it quiet
If you like it you can try it too
Stop me and buy one
I am illegal, that means so are you
Whisper, whisper, what have you got?
I've got something that you need a lot
Stop me and buy one
You can see better, but you better not

[Verse 3]
Whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper
Whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper

I am man and you are woman
Who needs marriage? We are humans all
If I could please you, arouse and ease you
Then it would please you if I should call
Doesn't matter what your name is
I can do a million things to you
No explanations, sexual patience
Most of the nation's doing it too

[Outro]
No, no, no
No, no

[Intro]
Hi kids, do you like Kim's bullshit? (No!)
Wanna see me stick her fucking eyeballs right in to my anus?

[Verse 1]
I got a fucking time traveling machine to go back all to this
And see all the piss that she gave me, bitch
She made me fall on my ass
The walls are caving in and I gotta go ham on this bitch
Like, woah, so we never fell in love so I didn't have to
Go through that shit no more
It's like a nugget, I'm hugging these sluts
That are bothering this fucking chick when I murder
And spit on the beat like the drugs I was taking
Just a bit of it
And stop slurping the blood off her face, or I'll murder you too with a bag full of mace and if Kim comes to my house and says "Wanna get back together?"
And I say "No, get out before I 

[slit your throat] and splatter the blood on this sweater!"
Blue eyes, red eyes, green eyes, bloody eyes
Hi Mom, you're back again, rock climbing my dick to see how famous my fucking life is?

[Chorus]
1980, still feeling shady, 1983, bitch never leave me
1987, met this bitch in heaven, 1999, my life was very deprived
I said hey, do you want me? I'm still feeling kinda shady
1999, we got 3 babies, 1999, will you ever leave me?
Because back then, I was kind of shady
1980, still feeling shady, 1983, bitch never leave me
1987, met this bitch in heaven, 1999, my life was very deprived
I said hey, do you want me? I'm still feeling kinda shady
1999, we got 3 babies, 1999, will you ever leave me?
Because back then, I was kind of shady

[Verse 2]
Ring around the rosie, pocket full of posie
Kim, Kim, be shady like me, I'm trying for the 4th
Stop being a bitch, please, walking across the highway
Playing Chicken, while brains splatter all over the road like
"ricken, ricken", my phone's dead, now how can I call the bitch?
I'll use the payphone, this bitch is calling my dead phone, she won't leave me alone
Spent 75 cents on her, and she didn't answer
Now I'll come to her house and 

[slaughter her ancesters]
Boo! I'm a ghost, you happy to see me? I'm taking your soul
Well shit, you don't believe me? Boom, I did it, do you believe me now? Shit whatever, I'm the king so hand me the crown

[Chorus]
1980, still feeling shady, 1983, bitch never leave me
1987, met this bitch in heaven, 1999, my life was very deprived
I said hey, do you want me? I'm still feeling kinda shady
1999, we got 3 babies, 1999, will you ever leave me?
Because back then, I was kind of shady
1980, still feeling shady, 1983, bitch never leave me
1987, met this bitch in heaven, 1999, my life was very deprived
I said hey, do you want me? I'm still feeling kinda shady
1999, we got 3 babies, 1999, will you ever leave me?
Because back then, I was kind of shady

[Outro]
1999, the slut's pussy is so dry, I said 1999, the slut's pussy is so dry, no other faggot can control my life

[Intro]
"SLIM!"
HI MY NAME IS...
...Bitch you make me hurl

[Verse 1]
They call me superman, leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now, got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down, in a relationship
Save it bitch, babysit, you make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit, girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase, I tell a muthafuckin' slut, to her face
Play no games, say no names, ever since I broke up with what's her face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass, kiss my lips, bitch why ask
Kiss my dick, get my cash, I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out, won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit, wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice, buy you ice, bitch if you died, I wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be my new wife, what you Mariah, fly through twice...

[Pre-Chorus]
But I do know one thing though, bitches, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday, Monday through Sunday yo'
Maybe I'll love you one day, maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho'...

[Chorus A]
Cause I can't be your Superman (Cry me a River)
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman (Cry me a River-er)
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman (Cry me a River)
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman... (Cry me a River-er, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Don't get me wrong, I love these ho's
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what, that's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again, I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kind of car I'll be in, we'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that, neither do I, I don't want to flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do, how could it ever be just us two
I'd never love you enough to trust you, we just met and I just fucked you...

[Pre-Chorus]
But I do know one thing though, bitches, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday, Monday through Sunday yo'
Maybe I'll love you one day, maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho'...

[Chorus B]
Cause, I know you want me baby, I think I want you too (Cry me a River, Cry me a River-er)
"I think I love you baby", I think I love you too (Cry me a River)
I'm here to save you girl, come be in Shady's world (Cry me a River-er)
I want to grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby, you know I want you too (Cry me a River)
They call me superman, I'm here to rescue you (Cry me a River-er)
I want to save you girl, come be in Shady's world (Cry me a River)
"Ooooh boy you drive me crazy", bitch you make me hurl... (Cry me a River-er, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
First thing you say, "I'm not fazed, I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyways
You're just plain old Marshall to me"
Ooh ya' girl run that game
"Hallie Jade, I love that name, love that tattoo, what's that say?"
"Rot in pieces, uh, that's great."
First off you don't know Marshall, at all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal, I'll slap you off that barstool
There goes another lawsuit, leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy whoadie, you must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have, ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab, end up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a tampax, and slap you till you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance, don't mean to ruin your plans...

[Pre-Chorus]
But I do know one thing though, bitches, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday, Monday through Sunday yo'
Maybe I'll love you one day, maybe we'll someday grow
Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho'...

[Chorus B]
Cause, I know you want me baby, I think I want you too (Cry me a River, Cry me a River-er)
"I think I love you baby", I think I love you too (Cry me a River)
I'm here to save you girl, come be in Shady's world (Cry me a River-er)
I want to grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby, you know I want you too(Cry me a River)
They call me superman, I'm here to rescue you (Cry me a River-er)
I want to save you girl, come be in Shady's world (Cry me a River)
"Ooooh boy you drive me crazy", bitch you make me hurl... (Cry me a River-er, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus A]
Cause I can't be your Superman (Cry me a River)
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman (Cry me a River-er)
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman (Cry me a River)
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman... (Cry me a River-er, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Cry me a river, oh (Cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river, oh (Cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river, oh (Cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river, oh (Cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river, oh (Cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river, oh (Cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river, oh (Cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river (Cry me, cry me)

(Cry me, cry me)

[Intro - Nas]
Mic check, mic check

[Hook - Nas] (Beastie Boys)
One (one), two (two), three (three)
Too many rappers, and there's still not enough MCs
It goes three (three), two (two), one (one)
MCA, Adrock, Mike D, that's how we get it done
Like ladies and gents, attention
Nas in the house with Beastie Boys
We can turn it out
Perpetrators, we can point 'em out
So if you got somethin' on your mind, let it out

[MCA]
Like a Nexus-6, comin' home to roost
Handheld 58 when it's time to get loose
Don't need the ear goggles, just put me through the speakers
Like a scientist with tubes and beakers
Have MCs over my house and fix 'em brunch
But you rappers? We goin' out, goin' dutch
So pass me the sword, I'll start swingin'
Just randomly chopping on a crazy ass mission

[Ad-Rock]
Because I'm back with a bang, boogie, oogie-oogie
Strawberry Letter 23 like Shuggie
Oh my God, just look at me
Grandpa been rappin' since '83
I'm supersonic like J.J. Fad
Got crazy-ass shit pullin' out the bag
Don't forget the tartar sauce, yo, cause it's sad
All these crab rappers, they're rappin' like crabs

[Nas]
I have carte blanche, the vagabond
Nas is the narcissist, my pockets are rotund
I'm no killa, but compared to you, I'm more real'a
You ain't a shot, a mobster, or a drug dealer
A slug peeler, you're not
Mafioso, no
You ain't got the cut-throat in ya, beginner
I ain't tryin' to hear your racket
You work with police, dog, you snitch, you rat
You wear that jacket

[Mike D]
How many rappers must get dissed
Gimme eight bars, and watch me bless this
I start to reminisce, ooh, when I miss
The real hip hop with which I persist
Like rum in mojitos
Bullets and banditos
Matzoh balls in soup
Jackets and troop
Yes, y'all, this is one for the history books
Nasty Nas, what's the word?
Count it off on the hook

[Hook]

[MCA]
Cause this the type of lyric goes inside your brain
To blow you bullshit rappers straight out the frame
My lyrics spin 'round like a hurricane twister
So get your hologram on off-a Wolf Blitzer
Too many rappers to shake a stick at
I oughta charge a tax for every weak rap I had to listen to
Cause we be makin' stacks like Stax Records
My squad, we gotta pact -- we're never coming wack

[Ad-Rock]
To all you crab rappers and hackers
And circuit benders tweaked on Splenda
I take the cake, I stole the mold
The golden microphone, well, that's mine to hold
And why all these biters all up in my crotchspace?
Sniffin', buffin', huffin'
And mean muggin' with a Blimpie Bluffin
Back up off me, suckas, you ain't sayin' nothin'

[Nas]
I'm broader than Broadway, I was the project hallway
Dual tape recorder, lacin' oratorials all day
I'm just getting started on this beat, this is foreplay
And when this song's finished, y'all can sing along with this
By the way, I have a strong fetish for Christian Louboutin steppers
I hear Russian blonde's the wettest
But anyway, I better pay homage to my fellas
And that's what's on my mind and the rhyme, who's next up?

[Mike D]
Mike D, the man of mystery
History in the makin', and now we're takin'
Titles, awards, and accolades
Scarin' the competition as I sharpen my blades
We come together like peanut butter and sandwiches
Like pen and paper, like Picasso and canvases
Rockin' stadiums and shitty bars
Go back in time, send a fax from my car

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I got the money in the bed with me (Bed with me)
A money counter on the dresser
I thank God money there for me (Thank you)
I hope we always be together (Together)
A nigga told me he was scared for me (Fuck you scared for me, nigga?)
I told him, "Get your shit together" (Get your best five, fuck nigga)
I walk around with big heads on me (Faces)
I went-I went to sleep with the bread on me (Ahaha, strong, nigga)
I get money every day of the week
You know it's dawg on dawg, these niggas'll kill they dawg to eat (Fuck)
I got that .44 bulldog on me and I blast for free (Blast for free)
I got them young niggas who'll kill you for an ounce of weed

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]

Re, re, re, remix
I know a rich nigga with them bricks in Zone 6 (Guwop)
Ain't no way in hell they gon' catch up for my whole clique (YSL)

And she finna get a crown
Put my name on her
Pussy real good with my name on it
Put my name on her
Pussy real good with my name

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
She just want my last name
Now watch her blow them candles out, they leave a wax stain
I put the D on it like she just got a bad grade
Then let off all over your back like I got bad aim
Cachet, back lace, fat 

[?], black tape
Fifty Shades of B.o.B, this fifty days of 

[?]
She loving all the crew, I think she finna baby squat
I put it on a box like post-its, she turn around, I poke it
I write my name in cursive then sign it with emojis
That's that smiley face, happy face from that eggplant, eggplant
Make that kitty cat walking sign, then a headstand, headstand
Body shots, cash stands, I'm faded, oh
This is not a test but she take it, that pussy look amazing
With my name on it
God knew what he was doing when he made women
Gotta wrap it up like the rain coming
And I ain't got a line but them Js jumping

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jake Lambo]
Pussy look good with my name on it
Perfect picture, make a nigga put a frame on it
Treat it like a bass drum, I'mma bang on it
Never liked plain, I love Mary Jane only
Give me dome 'fore I hit, call it headstart
She say that I drive her crazy with my damn car
I don't even drive, I ain't even trying
She wet like the ocean, I go scuba diving
She a cougar, oh yes, her man a loser, I know
No, we're not making no music, I make her hit the high notes
See OK baby, you blessed, got all that junk in your trunk
Now let me get behind that all so you can come back it up

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lin Z]
Funny that it's his, only wanna put it down
Give me everything from the throne to the crown
Riding round town, working background
Foreign only way I get around
Pussy so good, got him licking on his fingers
In the back of the 2-seater, 

[?]
Dripping down the dick, then I hit the split, getting lit

[?] sipping on that Cris, he loving it
Yelling out "my government", sex toys 

[?]
Bitches know I run it, you ain't know it's nothing trick
Let him put his name on the cake
I let him put his name on the cake

[Hook]

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Bobby go savage, all my shit classic
I don't fuck around, nigga, I'ma wreak havoc
Stoned like a tablet, stoned like 

[?]
Stay with that leaf, eyes closed like captions
Got a street team cause this ain't just rappin'
I got bad habits, I'm always with a bad bitch
One Janet Jackson, one Toni Braxton
Goin' both ways like four way traffic
Pockets on beast mode, bands goin' ape shit
You sleepin' on who? I set fire to your mattress
Always tryna figure a nigga out like fractions
I just wear the box out like fashion
Put the pussy in a grave or a casket
Write my name on the cake in italics
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain
I hope you got your seatbelts fastened, I'm goin' up

[Pre-Hook: B.o.B]
Up, I'm goin' up
Up, I'm goin' up
Up, I'm goin' up

[Verse 2: Lin-Z]
Y'all in the way, nigga fall back
You small time, where your boss at?
Big money, we talk that
Broke nigga call, I don't call back
Maybe I let the 

[?] strip a little
Kiss the ring, kiss the middle
I'm in this bitch, don't need the kibble

[?] don't need to dribble
Goin' up like elevators
New printer, that's hella paper
Bad bitches got hella flavors
I get served, I don't need a waitor
No Genre and we celebratin'
Keep winnin' so they hella hatin'
They watchin' from the window
Shut it down like renovation
Lin-Z, baby, drive you crazy
Switchin' lanes, new Mercedes
Hella sauce, that's hella gravy
Cut the check before it hits the table
What you know about it?
Celine bag, yes your ho 'bout it
Top on, it's so private
With no pilot, I'm goin' up

[Pre-Hook: B.o.B]
Up, I'm goin' up

[Verse 3: Jaque Beatz]
Ah this that nasty flow
Neighbors at your door with the casserole
All about the cream, ice and the Cogn'
Jungle fever, she tryna get the anacon' - boom
Bass like a trampoline
Her man at home and she ain't tryna dance alone
She love me too and I'ma get my trample on it
It's Chinese food and I'ma get my sample on, ho
Push that button
It's all in your head, that's concussion
Better get up on your shit or fuck around and flush it
Jackie Chan with a 

[?], I ain't tryna rush it
So keep it movin'
Cause ain't nobody here believe in losin'
And we ain't givin' up, the chances too slim
Ho we don't give a fuck so keep your two cents

[?] could use that shit
Let me get a verse and I abuse that bitch
This shit'll never stop me, I defuse that quick
Give a shit about your story, I conclude that bitch
Magnum P.I., come prove that shit
But my Magnum P.I. wanna lube that clit
Just sayin', niggas say they got the picture
When they know it's just crayon
Go to church, do communion with the pope
While prayin', I'm goin' up

[Hook: 

[?]]
Give me the weed, I'ma roll up (I'm goin' up)
Give me the drank, I'ma pour it up (I'm goin' up)

[Verse 4: Jake Lambo]
If your cards ain't right, I don't deal with you
I know the deal, shawty, she just want my dill pickle
It's real simple, they send shots, I send missiles
Still iller, they still sweet, they're still Skittles
I write riddles, you pay attention, you might get 'em
Ain't nobody that's really fuckin' with my niggas
No Genre the label so I'ma ride with 'em
Yeah these tats are permanent, I'ma die with 'em
Goin' nuts like almonds
Tell 'em if they with it you can get it if you want it
Chillin' with your bitch, she let me hit it in the mornin'
I don't really see 'em, someone show me my opponents
You know I'm the shit like I'm just bein' honest
You ain't runnin' shit like why you keep on stumblin'?
Can't you see I'm hungry? My stomach is rumblin'
Tell me what you're doin', nigga you ain't doin' nothin', goin' up

[Hook:

[Verse 5: London Jae]
Money on my mind, I don't know what y'all thinkin' 'bout
I'm chasin' down the bankroll, ho I'm goin' up
Two hundred for a line, couple racks for a pint
You ain't drinkin' like me, lil' nigga I'm pourin' up
I'm ready for whatever, chain on heavy metal
Got them diamonds in my watch and they change up like the weather
I'm speedin' to the top, you strugglin' down the pedal
I'm doggin' them hoes out, you strugglin' there to get 'em
Paid a mil' for the crib, way up in the hills
Damn I feel famous, they wavin' at the kid
Got money on me, homie, like Baby in this bitch
Got the chopper with the drum like Eddie in this bitch
Me and my team ball, nigga you still shavin'
I'm clean every day, lil' nigga you still bathin'
You waitin' on a handout, boy I stand out
Ask Bobby, I'm the man now, I'm goin' up

[Verse 1: Jimmy Cozier]
Something about the way you smiled at me just drove me wild
Wish I could know if you're alone, don't wanna cramp your style
But I cannot deny the feel that I feel when I looked straight into your eyes
Feel my heart beating fast for the challenge may arise

[Chorus: Jimmy Cozier]
I wanna know if you feel the way I do, I do
I wanna know if there's a chance for me and you, and you
If there's no way, meet at the bar and say you can't, you can't
'Cause I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
Like the way you've given me attention through the night
Maybe I've had too much Remy, my man's right by my side
Every time I catch you watching me, I feel something down my spine
I'll play the game, it's just for fun and only for tonight
All night

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I wanna know what makes you feel the way you do, you do
I think you're hoping there's a chance for me and you, and you
Should I meet you at the bar and say we can't, we can't?
'Cause I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair to Mr. Man

[Bridge: Alicia Keys & Jimmy Cozier, Both]
I know all you wanna know is answers
'Cause you can give me what I need (You can give me everything I need)
We both know that we're attracted
Should we let our desires, should we let our desires lead?

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Jimmy Cozier]
I wanna know if you feel the way I do, I do (I know, you know)
I wanna know if there's a chance for me and you, and you (If it's healthy, tell me)
If there's no way, meet at the bar and say you can't, you can't (You can meet me at the bar)
'Cause I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man
I wanna know if you feel the way I do, I do (Do you wanna know? I know you do)
I wanna know if there's a chance for me and you, and you
If there's no way, meet at the bar and say you can't, you can't
'Cause I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man
I wanna know if you feel the way I do, I do
I wanna know if there's a chance for me and you, and you
If there's no way, meet at the bar and say you can't, you can't
'Cause I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man

[Intro: Lin-Z]
Damn

I'm killin' shit

[Verse 1: Lin-Z]
Champagne splash
Rosé in my glass
Fancy with an ass
Pinky up, I got class
Blowin' money fast
Weed green as grass
Your babysittin' ass
Need to puff, puff, pass
Picture me rollin'
And got your nigga on swollen
Every night, nigga we goin'
Smokin' on potent, nigga we pourin'
Nigga you know it, nigga you know it
Nigga you know it
Facial expressions gon' show it
Cause you're a ho and you know it

[Hook: Lin-Z]
Damn
Damn

[Verse 2: Lin-Z]
Your bitch be hatin', call me the gold, I'm the greatest
And I'm the shit, no debatin'
I am amazing, can't believe what God created
Smokin' on out and I'm faded
Beautiful and I'm creative
I know you waitin'
Nigga I'm blazin', nigga I made it
Up in the Tesla
Pull me a bitch, her name's Vanessa
You can call me a finesser
She told me her sign a Cancer
She shake it at Follie's, a dancer
Is she Rudolph or Vixen or Prancer?
Sway you do not have the answers! No!
Sway you do not have the answers! No

Hi mamacita, nice to meet you
Wouldn't wanna be you, your bitch look like a creature
Won't talk to you if it's money or a feature

Signin' autographs for 'bout 10K
Niggas know my name, yeah, niggas know my name, Lin-Zay
Or.... Lin-Z
Be, be, be yourself, nigga don't be me
Cause I all do is fly, and niggas can't see me
Cause I'm Lin-Z and I'm in that Jeep
Jeep, beep, beep, beep, beep
Move out my fuckin' lane cause
I'm all over the place like SKRRR
And I can't stop, I can't chill
In the throwback like

And you know I'm trained to kill

Yeah I’ll introduce you to the dooms do dooms
Come let we go, do you like my perfumes?
Made it at home with some gasoline and shrooms
Oil and water are two extremes
We like fucking carpets, you like fucking brooms
Why is your tattoo some ugly looking thing?
I got many designs they're downloading on Bing
My cousin got his G.C.S.E.'s decorating
He’s handy you might need him when I finish what I’m saying
Let's be frank, you my stan, I'm your stan
I don’t care what you smoke, what you fucking drank
I'm allowed to be pissed at mates who are yanks
Cause it’s not me and you, it's the fucking banks!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!

Paper, scissors, got no bomb
Can't touch this, could you get out? Done!

[Verse 1]
There will never come a day
You will never hear me say
That I want to or need to be without you
I wanna give my all
Baby, just hold me
Simply control me
Because your arms
They keep away the loneliness

[Pre-Chorus]
When I look into your eyes
Then I realize
All I need is you in my life
All I need is you in my life

[Chorus]
'Cause I never felt this way about loving, no
Never felt so good, baby
Never felt this way about loving
It feels so good

[Intro]
Mm-hm
Mm-hm-mm

[Verse 1]
Lately, when I look into your eyes, I realize
You're the only one I need in my life
Baby, I just don't know how to describe
How lovely you make me feel inside

[Chorus]
You give me butterflies
Have me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflies
You give me butterflies
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflies

[Verse 2]
It seemed like the likely thing
From the start, you told me, yeah
I would be your queen
But never had I imagined such a feeling
Joy is what you bring, I wanna give you everything

[Chorus]
You give me butterflies
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflies
You give me butterflies
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control these butterflies

[Bridge]
You and I are destiny
I know now
You were made for me (Oh)
Oh, ooh-ooh
I can't control it
It's driving me
Taking over me, and I, oh-ooh

[Chorus]
You give me butterflies
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflies
You give me butterflies
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflies
You give me butterflies (Butterflies)
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control, I can't control it (Butterflies)
You give me butterflies (Butterflies)
Got me flying so high in the sky (Butterflies)
I can't control the butterflies, oh no, oh no, oh no

[Outro]
You give me something I just can't deny (Got me flying so high in the sky)
Something that's so real
I just can't control the way I feel (Control the butterflies)
Inside of me (Oh no, oh no, oh no)
You give me something I just can't deny (Butterflies)
Something that's so real (Got me flying so high in the sky)
I just can't control the way I feel
Oh, I never felt like this

You the born hunter
Relic with an armored heart
Color of sulfur
Banished to a single arc
Porcelain smolder and don't forget you're state of the art
Buried deep in the soil, selfless or daft

It could be a compass, rare and so bountiful
It could be the opposing opinion
It could be the point of traction bound to all

Running with my eyes closed
Blinding the lens with the focus
Running with my eyes closed
Finding omens in the woodwork
I see cold cold braille
Mechanical and frail
How do I tessellate, filter the rage

You the born hunter
Relic with an armored heart

[Verse 1]
Bumping some shawty
Rollin my window down and hitting the highway
No its not Friday
But its my day
And sometimes shit gotta go my way
Niggas got me fucked up
Thinking that my music don’t stick like some nunchucks
Top dawg and we all stars like we run chucks
But never mind that
Take a trip to outer space show you where my mind at
You know where my grind at
Inside of the studio where I spend my time at
Fuck over the game til' I make that bitch climax
Miss me with that bullshit haters die young
You can run to the poor pit
Pullin' off the pit stop
Car like a flip flop
Bitches clap at me like they wanna make my piss hot
I don’t even trip doe I don’t need no company
Me, I’m thinkin long term tryna' build a company
Kendrick the good kid

[Hook]
As I move I feel way better doing me I can only do me
I hope that you do you I think to myself truthfully I can only feel later
Some people say that I’m rude but I don’t give a damn if she if he if them or they say
I’m uncool nothin' but change how I feel bout' me today

[Verse 2]
Nigga, what I depose be so potent
That if the earth dried I could spit back the ocean
Then hop on a jet-ski and start West-Coastin'
I’m not boastin' or braggin' not a person I’m a dragon
Takin' action in the heat of the night
So if the devil came tell him that I be alright
I’m so high off life that I can OD
Walk outside then sniff a whole key
Old lady done called the police
Its just an average Joe walkin' with his heart on his Pendex
Don’t be afraid to speak
So to speak you niggas not within arm reach
Y’all midget Max swingin' on Shaq now have a seat
You can never coexist with my momma’s oldest
Kendrick be thy name
I got my mind right
My nigga locked in the pin, that's what my mind write
Ink over my brain
What's up

[Hook]
As I move I feel way better doing me I can only do me
I hope that you do you I think to myself truthfully I can only feel later
Some people say that I’m rude but I don’t give a damn if she if he if them or they say
I’m uncool nothin' but change how I feel bout' me today

[Verse 3]
So let me start off the third verse
Pickin' up your favorites is our curse
Fuck the system, fuck the truth, fuck religion
Fuck the government, fuck the law, fuck the prisons
Fuck George Bush, fuck rappers who love dissin'
Fuck you because you don’t see my vision
I fucked your new girlfriend too
Because she’s cute and the ass
Looks like a grenade within the denim
Fuck the groupies, fuck the gossipin' bitches
Fuck niggas that can’t fight so pull triggas'
Fuck the new world gas price that cost a livin'
Fuck your love fuck your hate fuck your snitchin'
Whether you fuck with me or not
I don’t give a fuck you can keep your props
Fuck keepin' it real
I'm a keep it K-dot
Kendrick everyday Jay-Z didn’t lie
Fucker

[Hook]
As I move I feel way better doing me I can only do me

I'm the best the world has ever seen (I'm the best ever!)
I'm somebody you'll never forget 'cause I work hard and sweat in my tears (Can't be stopped!)
I'm never falling again and if I did, I'd come back

[Verse 1: Madonna]
If you try and fail, get up again
Destiny will choose you in the end
If you don't make the choice, and you don't use your voice
Someone else will speak for you instead

[Verse 2: Madonna]
What you want is just within' your reach
But you gotta practice what you preach
You pay with sweat and tears to overcome your fears
Never let the fire inside you leave

[Chorus: Madonna]
"I-can't", "icon" - two letters apart
One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star
Show the world who you are, who you are
Yeah, there's another part of you no one sees
There's a burning fire that's underneath
Baby, don't you know you were meant to be
Born to be, meant to be

"I-can't", "icon" - two letters apart
One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star

Alright
Firefly change when they catch ya
Wanna put ya in their net for their light glow
Yellow brick highway
Paparazzi piled up on the high road
They just turned the sun into an idol
They just wanna see how high the sky go
Just to find how it feel to fall back
Madonna said I remind her of Michael
Steady blowing up my head, blowing up my head
Put it on your wall
Put me in the school book, put me in the laws
Put me in the desk and in the Synagogue
Firefly glow when they catch ya
Wanna catch ya when ya lights go dim
Wanna turn you to a letter in their logo
Wanna stick you in a jar with a pen
You an icon

[Chorus: Madonna]
"I-can't", "icon" - two letters apart
One step away from being lost in the dark
Just shine your light like a beautiful star
Show the world who you are who you are

[Intro: Action Bronson]
Yeah..
Might have to lay down on the floor for this one, son...
I got the whole pack of Big League Chew by the cheekbone...

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Uh, I got the whole pack of Big League Chew by the cheekbone
It's that Monte Carlo flooded with the weed smoke
The rifle to the peephole, free throw
Call me Baby Face, welcome to the creep show
Uh, my clique is so nuts
Big shit to lift you like a triple-toe lutz
In these streets, even a cripple gonna bust
Keep a thing that won't rust
There's no trust
Rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
After I'm high and disgraced, only a lion remains
Flying from a tropical escape
"Did I do a perfect dive?" is such a popular debate
(Well, I'll give it a 9.3)
I'm the hottest shit since B2K
My Russian barber gave me the see-through fade
Drunk-driving on a Thursday
Already told you, with this money, it concerns me (Bronson, Bronson, Bronson)

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Yeah
I got an old soul and young legs
I'm like a good horse
Wood splash on the floor, that's for decor
That's from the tour
Above the law
A half a million in the wall
By the painting of the Great Dane
Bought the drugs in front a A-Frame
Flashbacks of riding on the A-Train
Getting sucked between the cars by a Guatemalan
She started humming on em, honey wildin', uh
Nowadays, you can see me in a trench coat
On the French boat, till I'm dead broke
I got the shit locked in a deadbolt
Go get your fucking shit, baby, let's go
I might never see rain again
I might never see pain again
I might never see snow again
Picture my mother, say motherfucker keep going in
Uh, The stars all align now
Oh, these cars I'mma buy now
Oooh, these bitches I'mma fuck, too
You ain't gotta like me, fuck you

[Verse 1]
Cut me down the middle
Fucked me up a little
You said I was your queen
I tried to give you everything
And now you want your freedom
You got just what you came for
A bit of fame and fortune
Now I'm no longer needed

[Pre-Chorus]
You said it was over, wanted it to end
Then you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends
You had a few secrets I was never told
Now everyone's talking and I'm the last to know

[Chorus]
Now I'm in the middle of Heartbreak City (Heartbreak City)
'Cause I'm in the middle of a world not pretty (World not pretty)
Your clever game got the best of me (Best of me)
But you ain't gonna get the rest of me (Rest of me)
'Cause I'm in Heartbreak City

[Verse 2]
Tore me into pieces
Didn't have no damn reason
I let you in my house
You helped yourself to everything
And left me with your mess
I curse the day we met
Your memory is haunting me
I wish I could forget

[Pre-Chorus]
You said it was over, wanted it to end
Then you had the nerve to say that we could still be friends
You had a few secrets I was never told
Now everyone's talking and I'm the last to know

[Chorus]
I'm in the middle of Heartbreak City (Heartbreak City)
'Cause I'm in the middle of a world not pretty (World not pretty)
Your clever game got the best of me (Best of me)
But you ain't gonna get the rest of me (Rest of Me)
'Cause I'm in Heartbreak City

[Outro]
And it's not that pretty

[Verse 1]
Mmm
Right now, I feel like a bird
Caged without a key
Everyone comes to stare at me
With so much joy and revelry
They don't know how I feel inside
Through my smile, I cry
They don't know what they're doing to me
Keeping me from flying
That's why I say that

[Pre-Chorus]
I know why the caged bird sings
And only joy comes from song
She's so rare and beautiful to others
Why not just set her free?

[Chorus]
So she can fly, fly, fly
Spreading her wings and her song
Let her
Fly, fly, fly
For the whole world to see

[Outro]
Mmm-hmm
Hey, hey, oh, mmm
She's like a caged bird
Fly, fly
Ooh, just let her fly
Just let her fly
Just let her fly
Spread the wings
Spread the beauty

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Everyday I ball, what about you?
I hang on the block, body full of tattoos
I’m from the south side, what about you?
Middle finger in the air, I do what I do
Everyday I ball, what about you?
Everyday I ball, what about you?
I go to the mall, with my boo
I say you can get that, matter fact get two
‘Cause all I think about, is gettin' to the house
‘Cause I’m gon’ lick it out
Before I stick it in
A pocket full of Benjamins and all of ‘em dead
Pussy head pussy, pussy pussy head

Never let a snitch nigga slide
Yellow diamonds like a cab, I don't need a ride

Step my jewelry up, auntie said don't go outside
Serious, red diamond period, crazy color carrots
Cup cake curious, cup cake curious
Pussy rehab, pussy rehab
I bought her a pistol, she bought me a bag
So icy boys, totin' duffle bags
I get so much pussy I should give pussy a break
Hit her from the back, sipping lean, blowing loud
She screamin' kinda loud, baby will you turn it down
Make her turn around
Hit it from the front, then I smoke a jawnt
It's my first day out the joint
Make her turn around
Hit her from the front, then I smoke a jawnt
Cause it's my first day out the joint

[Bridge: 2 Chainz]

Suckin’ on them titties, she gon’ think a nigga Dracula
Feastin’ on that ass, she gon’ think a beast attackin’ her
Slappin’ on that ass, she lookin’ back while I’m slappin’ her
Shawty make me bust quick, she already know that
Not because I can't hang, ‘cause her pussy so wet
Her pussy so wet, I think I’m drowning
Her pussy so wet, she let me pound it
Beat it up, beat it up
Hit it ‘til she aching

[Verse 1]
Every story needs an introduction
Can you introduce me to our love?
And I've been hiding from my own destruction
Hoping you'll protect me from above

[Pre-Chorus]
All my life I have been locked away
But if you're here to stay

[Chorus]
Won't you scratch the surface for me?
You scratch the surface for me

[Verse 2]
And I've in and out of introspection
Pulling at the harlots of the heart
And we're both looking for a new reaction
But we'll never know if we don't start

[Pre-Chorus]
All my life I walked away
But if I'm here to stay

[Chorus]
Won't you scratch the surface for me?
You scratch the surface for me

And I've looked the other way
But now, I'm un-afraid to say

Won't you scratch the surface for me?

There's a place you gotta go
Before I let you take it all
It's like a drug, it should be illegal
Baby, you should get down low
And drink my precious alcohol
You look so thirsty, I think you need it

[Chorus: Natalia Kills & Madonna]
Kiss it better, kiss it better

Find salvation deep within
We can do it here on the floor

Kiss it better, kiss it better

[Chorus]
I'll make this the best night of your life

[Verse 2]
We don't have to speak that much
I hear you and I feel your touch
Whisper in my ears, make me blush
Feel the chills when we kiss, don't forget
All your wildest dreams, don't hold back
All the fantasies you ever had
Just do what you like, go ahead
Close your eyes, make a wish, no regrets

[Chorus]
I'll make this the best night of your life
I'll make this the best night of your life

Repeat it like a mantra (For you)
I'm in love, I'm in love

[Verse 1]
A million miles later
We walked through the valley of the darkest night
We made it through the fire
Scarred and we're bruised, but our hearts will guide us
Together, I know our love's gonna last forever
We're gonna be alright tonight

[Verse 2]
We'll live with no limits
We'll dance in the middle of the freezing rain
With you and I in it
Survive the eye of a hurricane
Together, we're gonna make this better
We're gonna be alright tonight

[Chorus]
Hold tight, as long as you're by my side
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright
Only love, only love tonight
Lights off, we're burning so bright
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright

[Drop]
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna

[Verse 3]
A million miles later
We walked through the valley of the darkest night
We made it through the fire
Scarred and we're bruised, but our hearts will guide us
Together, I know our love's gonna last forever
We're gonna be alright tonight

[Chorus]
Hold tight, as long as you're by my side
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright
Only love, only love tonight
Lights off, we're burning so bright
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright

[Drop]
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna

[Bridge]
I don't wanna breathe air that you're not breathing
I don't wanna hear if your heart's not beating
If you hurt, then I wanna be the one that's bleeding
Wanna be the one that's bleeding

[Breakdown]
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright

[Drop]
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna
Only love, only love tonight
Lights off we're burning so bright
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna
Everything's gonna

[Verse 1]
Each time they take a photograph
I lose a part I can't get back
I wanna hide
This is the part where I detach
Each time they write a hateful word
Dragging my soul into the dirt
I wanna die
Never admit it, but it hurts

[Chorus]
I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
But I'm in the dark, yeah
I can't be a superhero right now
Even hearts made out of steel can break down
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
I'm only human

[Post-Chorus]
Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing, 'cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be a war, but I'm not going down

[Verse 2]
One little lie can ruin my day
Words are like weapons, they betray
When I am afraid
One word of kindness, it can save me

[Chorus]
I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
But I'm in the dark, yeah
I can't be a superhero right now
Even hearts made out of steel can break down
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
I'm only human

[Post-Chorus]
Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing, 'cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be a war, but I'm not going down

[Bridge]
Being destructive isn't brave
They couldn't say it to my face
One day, I won't care
But for the moment, I'm not there
I'll just close my eyes and let you catch me now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna talk about it right now
Just hold me while I cry my eyes out
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
But I'm in the dark, yeah
I can't be a superhero right now
Even hearts made out of steel can break down
I'm not Joan of Arc, not yet
I'm only human

[Post-Chorus]
Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing, 'cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be a war, but I'm not going down
Anything they did to me, said to me
Doesn't mean a thing, 'cause you're here with me now
Even when the world turns its back on me
There could be a war, but I'm not Joan of Arc

[Verse 1]
Pull me closer
Full disclosure
Let it out, let me in, yeah
On your knees, confess to me
Every doubt, every sin, yeah
That's how love's supposed to be

[Chorus]
I wanna know what you're all about
You're beautiful when you're broken down
Let your walls crumble to the ground
Let me love you from the inside out
Every scar that you try to hide
All the dark corners of your mind
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
Let me love you from the inside out (One more time)

[Verse 2]
Let's discover
One another
Kiss me here, touch me there, yeah
Purest form of ecstasy
Truth or dare, don't be scared, yeah
Let me solve your mystery

[Chorus]
I wanna know what you're all about
You're beautiful when you're broken down
Let your walls crumble to the ground
Let me love you from the inside out
Every scar that you try to hide
All the dark corners of your mind
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
Let me love you from the inside out (One more time)
Let me love you from the inside out (One more time)
Let me love you from the inside out

[Post-Chorus]
Let me love you, let me love you from (One more time)
Let me love you from the inside out, yeah
Let me love you, let me love you from (One more time)
Let me love you from the inside out, yeah

[Bridge]
Let's cross the line so far we won't come back
Can't read your mind, I shouldn't have to ask
Cynical smile, time to take off your mask
I'm on your side, so let me love you, let me love you
(Let me love you from the inside out)
(I wanna love you from the inside out)

[Chorus]
I wanna know what you're all about
You're beautiful when you're broken down
Let your walls crumble to the ground
Let me love you from the inside out
Every scar that you try to hide
All the dark corners of your mind
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
Let me love you from the inside out
I wanna know what you're all about
You're beautiful when you're broken down
Let your walls crumble to the ground

Let me love you from the inside out, yeah (One more time)
Let me love you, let me love you from
Let me love you from the inside out, yeah (One more time)

Sex, sex tell me
Sex, sex tell me

[Post-Chorus Variation]
Oh my god, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top
Oh my god, soaking wet
Back and forth till we break the bed

[Verse 1]
When you read my mind, get down and discover me
I'm an open door, let you come inside of me
Want to put my hands around your neck
Gonna take you to a place that you will not forget

[Chorus]
Sex, what you know about sex?
Tell me what you know about sex
Sex, what you know about sex?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh my god, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top

And when I let you put it on me
You better give me what I want, baby

[Verse 2]
Oh my god
Let me clean your wound, I can be your nurse
Got the antidote, please show me where it hurts
Can you be my father? Tell me what to do
You can punish me and maybe I will punish you

[Chorus]
Sex, what you know about sex?
Tell me what you know about sex
Sex, what you know about sex?

[Post-Chorus]

Back and forth till we break the bed
You got a bad attitude
I like to grind it on you
And when I let you put it on me
You better give me what I want, baby

[Bridge]
Oh my
A lesson in sexology
Twisted rope, handcuffs
Blindfolds, string of pearls
Neckties, silk scarf
Silver chains, pretty girls
Thigh-highs, leather mask
High heels, golden mask
Perfume, switchblade
Absinthe, novocaine
Chopsticks, underwear
Barber soap, dental chair
Fishnets, satin sheets
Garter belt, raw meat
Candlelight, keyhole
Leather belt, meat stove
Golden shower, latex thong
Licorice whip, strap it on

[Post-Chorus]
Oh my god, you're so hot
Pull my hair, let me get on top
Oh my god, soaking wet
Back and forth till we break the bed
You got a bad attitude
I like to grind it on you
And when I let you put it on me
You better give me what I want, baby

[Outro]
Sex

[Verse 1]
Just take me with all my stupid flaws
Changing means like shooting in the dark
Patience, please, I'll never be as perfect as you want me to
Be-lieve me, I want it just as bad
Forgive me, wish I could change the past
Take it, 'cause, I'll never be as perfect as you want

[Pre-Chorus]
I think you're confusing me with somebody else
I won't apologize for being myself

[Chorus]
Take me with all of my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
I come to you with all my flaws
With all my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
With all my beautiful scars

[Verse 2]
Don't judge me, just gotta let me be
Accept me, although I'm incomplete
My im-per-fections make me unique, that's my belief

[Pre-Chorus]
I think you're confusing me with somebody else
I won't apologize for being myself

[Chorus]
Take me with all of my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
I come to you with all my flaws
With all my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
With all my beautiful scars

[Bridge]
Never say never, anything is possible
Always been a rebel, overcoming obstacles
I can't give you perfect, but I can give you forever
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Take me with all of my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
I come to you with all my flaws
With all my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
With all my beautiful scars

[Outro]
With all my beautiful scars
I love you the way that you are
(You got to love me, you got to love me)
(You got to love me, you got to love me)

[Intro]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...)

[Verse 1]
It will never rain, never rain
If the great sky falls down
No rain, no more rain
Blood's pouring down
High alert, we watch it burn
It's a world under siege
Sirens, sirens
Everyone's whispering, the CIA, MI6
Hide the unknown
We're at the end of days, for heaven's sake

[Chorus]
The queen's been slain
She'll never rule again
The queen's been slain
She'll never rule again
Your queen's been slain
Queen's been slain

[Verse 2]
Black parade, motorcade
Destiny sings farewell, church bells
Is anyone listening?
Everywhere bowed in prayer
Tears are falling
Coming down, coming down
I hear the heavens calling
Providence, no evidence
There's no confirmation
And only silence remains
We only know one thing

[Chorus]
The queen's been slain
She'll never rule again
The queen's been slain
She'll never rule again
Your queen's been slain
Queen's been slain

[Bridge]
Who will take her place?
It's written on everyone's face
The truth is slowly dawning
I hear tomorrow calling
Some things can't be replaced
The realization of a new generation
On the eve of imitation
All gone, overthrown

[Chorus]
The queen's been slain
She'll never rule again
The queen's been slain
She'll never rule again
Your queen's been slain
Queen's been slain

[Outro]
May God bless you
May God bless you all
May God bless you all

[Verse 1]
Do we need to start a war?
Do we need to take a side?
If we open up our eyes
Realize that we are blind
Is it all worth fighting for?

[Pre-Chorus]
It all comes down to
Who's wrong or right
Who's black or white
It doesn't matter what you're bleeding for
Straight or bi, your God or mine
It doesn't matter underneath it all

[Chorus]
'Cause we're only here to love
Like there's no tomorrow
So let's live each moment like
Our time is only borrowed

[Verse 2]
Do we need to build a bomb?
Do we need to fire a gun?
If you have to stand your ground
It's a war that can't be won
Is it all worth dying for?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It all comes down to
Who's rich or poor
Virgin or whore
It doesn't matter what you're praying for
Death or life, your truth or mine
It doesn't matter underneath it all

[Chorus]
'Cause we're only here to love
Like there's no tomorrow
So let's live each moment like
Our time is only borrowed

[Pre-Chorus]
It all comes down to
Who's rich or poor
Virgin or whore
It doesn't matter what you're praying for
Death or life, you're truth almighty
It doesn't matter underneath it all

[Chorus]
'Cause we're only here to love
Like there's no tomorrow
So let's live each moment like
Our time is only borrowed

[Outro]
Our time is only borrowed
Our time is only borrowed

[Verse 1]
If graffiti on the wall changed anything at all
Then it would be illegal
As the skies go away, what would your body say?
Don't ever hide your feelings

[Refrain]
Oh, oh, oh
Don't ever try to take my freedom
Oh, oh, oh
Your imperfections, this world needs them

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you got? Show me your Basquiat
He didn't keep it all to himself
Even with Keith out on the street, he died
Fighting so you can do it as well

[Chorus]
Love is pain and pain is art!
Show me your graffiti heart
Love is pain and pain is art!
Show me your graffiti heart
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, yeah
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Frida showed her feelings, painting from the ceiling
Back in the beginning
Nothing's what it seems, she painted all her dreams
Made her own reality

[Refrain]
Oh, oh, oh
Don't ever try to take my freedom
Oh, oh, oh
Your imperfections, this world needs them

[Pre-Chorus]
What do you got? Show me your Basquiat
He didn't keep it all to himself
Even with Keith out on the street, he died
Fighting so you can do it as well

Love is pain and pain is art!
Show me your graffiti heart
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh

Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, yeah

[Bridge]
We can break down and take down
But they can't destroy our history
This wall, it must fall
To make room for our masterpiece

[Chorus]
Love is pain and pain is art!
Show me your graffiti heart
Love is pain and pain is art!
Show me your graffiti heart
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, yeah
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh
Woah-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, yeah

[Outro]
If graffiti on the wall changed anything at all
Then it would be illegal

[Verse 1]
I told you I don't want you all the time
'Cause you're not mine
I'm not in love, but I'm in light
So far it's working fine
But when I need you then I'm desperate
I'm a little child
Just like an animal, down on my knees and beggin'

[Chorus]
Yeah, all wrapped up, I wanna be your little baby now
Put my head on your shoulder
You can rock me, rock me now
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me

[Post-Chorus]
Open the door, unlock me
We've got tonight, so rock me now

[Verse 2]
I'm in my bed, and I'm possessed
I'm lying wide awake
I need someone like you to come
And put me in my place
'Cause in the day, I can't be tamed
Boy, you don't wanna know
But in the night, my hands are tied
You tell me where to go

[Chorus]
Yeah, all wrapped up, I wanna be your little baby now
Put my head on your shoulder
You can rock me, rock me now
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me

[Post-Chorus]
Open the door, unlock me
We've got tonight, so rock me
Open the door, unlock me
We've got tonight, so rock me now

[Bridge]
Rock me now
Rock me now

[Chorus]
Yeah, all wrapped up, I wanna be your little baby now
Put my head on your shoulder
You can rock me, rock me now
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me
Yeah, all wrapped up, I wanna be your little baby now
Put my head on your shoulder
You can rock me, rock me now
In the middle of the night you can hear me crying loud
Put my head on your shoulder and rock me

[Outro]
You and me, sitting on a tree
You be the daddy, I'll be the baby

[Verse 1]
I'm under your spell
Pulled me in, took me down with your poisonous touch
You brought me to hell
Watched me burn with the fever that I love so much
You're watching me crawl
You get your kicks, take your fist, put it right through the wall
The drug that I crave
You're so clever, you're the devil, watch you slither away

[Chorus]
See, I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

[Verse 2]
Your truth is a lie
Bitter fruit, bitter sweet
But oh, so divine
Now that I've had a taste
Like a moth to a flame, I'm addicted to pain

[Chorus]
See, I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

[Post-Chorus]
I'm addicted
I'm, I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm, I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm, I'm addicted to the one that got away

[Chorus]
See, I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away
See, I don't know what it is
But I'm attracted to the dark
And it was easy to predict
You were gonna be the one who broke my heart
You were gonna be the one who tore it apart
Make me fall down on my knees and start to pray
You were gonna be the one that got away

[Post-Chorus]
I'm addicted
I'm, I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm, I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm, I'm addicted to the one that got away

[Verse 1]
With all these curves we might need to have the brakes looked at
So pop the hood and see what's good, I need a tune-up bad
My pressure's low, I'm on a roll but my transmission's blown
I heard a thump and then a knock

[Pre-Chorus]
I hear you work at a body shop
I hear you work at a body shop

[Chorus]
You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on my line

[Post-Chorus]
You can polish the headlights
You can smooth out the fender
You can start the ignition
We can go on a bender

[Verse 2]
Stuck to the seat, our body heat, what will you do with all this ass?
Let's shift a gears, get outta here, we're stepping on the gas
We gotta bounce, we're going fast, let's let the seat go back
You take the wheel, I'll sit on top

[Pre-Chorus]
I hear you work at a body shop
I hear you work at a body shop

[Chorus]
You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on my line
You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on my line

[Post-Chorus]
Overheating the engine
Might be blowing a gasket
Tighten up the suspension
And you don't have to ask it

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I, I hear you work at a body shop
I, I, I, I hear you work at a body shop

[Bridge]
I would drive to the ends of the earth for you
Jumpstart my heart, you know what you gotta do
I would ride through the dark of the night with you
Cross my heart and hope to die, it's true

[Chorus]
You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on my line
You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on my line

[Outro]
I hear you work at a body shop
I hear you work at a body shop
I hear you work at a body shop
I, I, I, I hear you work at a body shop
I hear you work at a body shop

[Verse 1: Troy Ave]
Dope boy Troy, don’t believe we’ve met
I know your ex boys kinda’ leave you stressed
Do what you do, I don’t think no less
I’m running these streets I don’t get no rest
And you tired of being sick and tired
Them others ain't work, tell em’ they fired
I’m always so hot, but in the right spots
The streets, clubs, rap and hip-hop, true
And if you are a hater just know I did it on you
Put on your makeup baby, you bout to do it too
We both can shine, I’m a real one, I don’t mind

[Hook: Usher]
Shawty, I don’t mind
If you dance on a pole, that don’t make you a ho
Shawty, I don’t mind
When you work until three, if you’re leaving with me
Go make that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
Cause I know how it is, go and handle your biz
And get that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
You can take off your clothes, long as you coming home
Girl, I don’t mind

[Verse 2: Usher]
The ballers in here tonight, they gon’ buy a hundred bottles
As soon as you shake it I know they gon’ make it colossal in here
Cause shawty you thinkin’ them tricks that you do with your body
Got all of these niggas they crowding around you like they seen Beyonce in here
You want your own and you need your own, baby, who am I to judge?
Cause how could I ever trip about it when I met you in the club?
I make enough for the both of us, but you dance anyway
You know I was raised in the A

[Hook: Usher]

[Verse 3: Usher]
When you get off of work I’ll be ready to go in the ‘Rari
And when we get home we’ll have us our own private party in here
So I don’t worry at all about the things they do or say
I love you anyway
You can twerk while in a split, you racking up them tips
Your body rock and your booty poppin’, I’m proud to call you my bitch
They be lookin’, but they can’t touch you, shawty, I’m the only one to get it
So just go ahead and keep doing what you doing

[Hook: Usher]

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
(It's ya boy, Juicy J)
I’m just tryna cut her up, tryna bust a nut
Tryna take somebody bitch, turn her to a slut
Tryna fill my cup, tryna live it up
Throw some hundreds on that ass, walk her out the club
(Yeah, ho) Lap dance for the first date
Bet I threw a few bands, that’s third base
It’s okay if you work late
We can still party like it’s your birthday
We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place
Blow her own gas, no Rolaid
When we in the bed she like to roleplay
Tell her friend to join in both ways

[Hook: Usher]

[Intro]
Ooh
Yeah, let me, let me try something real quick

[Verse 1]
If I gave you forever
Would you take care of me?
Would you take me for granted?
Run away

[Pre-Chorus]
Those wonderful things that you do
They've got me feeling in love with you
In love with you

[Chorus]
Lovin' you is easy
Comes so naturally
Lovin' you is easy
Comes so naturally

[Verse 2]
I would give you laughter
Oh, so much more than that (Oh yes, I would)
Anything you're after
I will climb the highest mountain, to bring it back
You'd better believe

[Pre-Chorus]
Those wonderful things that you do
They've got me feeling in love with you
In love with you

[Chorus]
Lovin' you is easy
Comes so naturally
Lovin' you is easy
Comes so naturally

[Bridge]
I will stay by your side
Whether I'm wrong, whether I'm right
Oh, it's incredible
With you, I intend to spend the rest of my life
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Lovin' you is easy
Comes so, it comes so naturally
Lovin' you is easy
Comes so, so, it comes so naturally

[Outro]
Lovin' you is easy
So easy
Lovin' you is easy
It comes so naturally
Lovin' you is easy (Ooh, darling)
Lovin' you is easy (I'm in love with you forever)
It comes so naturally
Lovin' you is easy

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
2015 Porsche Panamera
30 pounds of OG Gas bags
Riding in that Rari, yeah my pants sag
In a briefcase yeah that's a hundred bands
All I need is OG Gas, all i need is OG Gas
In a trap spot I got OG Gas, OG Gas, OG Gas

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Money bag, I'm getting guap
I done got a 2015 off the lot
Bruh, see me pulled up in a new drop
Bruh, see me in the kitchen whipping in the pot
100k, solid gold AP
30 thousand, Rolex diamonds 3d
Diamonds they dancing
Trap out the mansion
I pull up in Phantom
I know that the Feds they be watchin'
They snapping my bitch, they on cameras

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Money bag, they already know
Foreign whips with my cribs, that's marble floors
More money, more problems
Sitting in a mansion and I'm watching shottas
White Bentley, white diamonds with the gold bottles
In that foreign whip going full throttle
Turned the traphouse into millions of dollars
Christian Louboutins and Balenciagas

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
Go crazy in the coupe that's 2015
Soulja he sipping on pints of the lean
I got the pounds, your bitch in the kitchen, she bustin'em down
Came up, I was trapping out the mailbox
How the fuck you buy a rollie, but it tick~ tock?
Audemar, 50 thousand for the wrist watch
I got real deal gas, come in big blocks
Hundred bands ain't shit to a rich nigga
In a rarri and I still got your bitch with me
Smashing your ho and I pass her to Flippa
I got the gas like a swisher
100 thou on the MCM bag
On the lean and I hope I don't crash
Trapping and wrapping, I'm moving the gas
Young Nigga, I live for the cash

[Hook]

[Intro]
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no

[Verse 1]
You got me looking so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself, lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care
Baby, your love's got the best of me
Your love's got the best of me
Baby, your love's got the best of me
Baby, you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung, but I don't care who sees
'Cause baby, you got me, you got me
Oh you got me, you got me...

[Verse 2]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Eh, I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now
(Your love) Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (your love)
Looking so crazy in love
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in lo-o-o-ve
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in lo-o-o-ve

[Intro: Ludacris]
Yes, yes
Another installment, this simply just does not stop, man
It's a feeding frenzy going on, nigga!
Luda! Listen!

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Polo slippers, I'm a G, bitch!
Just did a show, been counting paper for a week, bitch
3 sips, I'll tear the club up like 3-6
Hanging with nines that could cause a solar eclipse
Luda! It's lunar how I maneuver in the night time
If it's bad bitches, it's the right time
Vintage Rolex, time pieces that last a life time
Whenever I decide to show up, that's my flight time
Tell the pilot I'm about to roll a doobie up
Louis'd up, bitches want a snack, Scooby Doo me up
Ruby'd up, fruity colored diamonds cause I'm movied up
Women screw me up, love me down then they chew me up
Just gettin' started, it's about to get solidified
Lyrical genocide, Ludacris has been identified
As one of the greats of all time, what am I to do?
Generation pimps, granddaddy and my father too
What the fuck are y'all thinking, this is heaven sent
8 albums in, other rappers are irrelevant
It's evident that I'm so elegant and intelligent
These other clowns sound like they rapping with speech impediments
Ol' dribble mouth niggas, y'all should lay it up
Play it up, talking about your life like you made it up
Well here's a story for the ages, I'm a living legend
And my security guards are named Smith & Wesson

[Outro: Ludacris talking]
Fuck an adlib on this one, man, let it ride
This for the fans, I love y'all, baby
Ludaversal, March 31st! I'm trynna fucking tell y'all
Best album I ever did, nigga. Hungry, boy!

[?], we going places, man

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Ice-T]
Some people claim that I'm born to play
'Cause I'm your Ice-T on a sunny day
I make the goers come, the leavers stay
I make the lovers kiss and the workers play
I make the runners walk, the quiet talk
I bust so viciously, I make the blind man see
I'm the ladies' cream, the virgins' wet dream
I got that kind of movement that makes the young girls fiend
I'm tired of these DJs going around
Talking about how they go down to town
'Cause I'm the best Rapper that you have found
So all you lovely ladies, let's party down
Take all your rapping records, throw them in the trash
Ice-T is the only brother that you got to blast
Hook up the stereo, turn up the watts
We're gonna rock 'til the niggas call up the cops
We rock rock y'all with no fear, and
If you don't dig it turn off your ears
We rock rock y'all and keep on, and
If you don't dig it take your damn self home
'Cause I'm a player, the best alive
I prefer fast money to a Nine-to-Five
From the womb to the tomb, I run my game
'Cause I'm cold as ice, and I show no shame

[Break: Sound of cold wind blowing]

[Verse 2: Ice-T]
Well I'm Ice-T, I'm terribly bad
I'm here to knock out the windows and blow up the pad
I may be small but I'm willing to say
I jam this party in one hell of a way
The powers I got are hard to find
I'll be breaking women's hearts while I'm blowing their minds
They be giving me money, and buying me things
But I spend their cash and pawn their rings
If they treat me right, I'm willing to show
The coolest young brother they'll ever know
But if they do me wrong, I hate to say
I'll never teach them how to rock this way
'Cause back in the thirties when times was hard
I had a sawed-off shotgun, a marked deck of cards
A turned up collar, a turned up hat
A .38 hustle and I stole that
I walked in the party, there were women for days
And I started dancing one hell of a way
I was dancing so hard, couldn't no one compete
I turned out the party with my Ice-cold feet
'Cause I'm a player, that's all I know
On a summer day, I play in the snow
From the womb to the tomb, I run my game
'Cause I'm cold as ice, and I show no shame

[Break: Sound of cold wind blowing]

[Verse 3: Ice-T]
We're born to play, and brought up that way
We catch the women night and day
And when I want to, I'll talk to you
And you'll become one of the chosen few
Can't you see that now I'm me?
I'm the brother known as Ice-T
And umm.. I'm the brother whose like no other
Who's black in soul but not in color
You dig the race, and a hit to the case
When you're trying to get outta my face
I'm trying to tell you I'm a brother that's nice
I'm sweet as honey, I'm cold as Ice
But if you say something to me that ain't too down
You'll be picking your booty up off the ground
You can ask your father, your sister or mother
I got a Rolls Royce in every color
I keep my rides tuned to perfection
I got a Stutz for every direction
I'm the pimp, the player, the women layer
The holy dueler, the whorehouse doer
I just play young whores, slam Cadillac doors
I'm the black Mack of the heart attack
But I don't smoke no whack, I don't cut no slack
I'm here to rock y'all, so rock rock
I'm Ice-T when I dress, I never jive
I do all my shopping on Rodeo Drive
When I leave the pad, I'm never loud
I'm just so sharp, I cut through the crowd
I got so many clothes in my wardrobe these days
When I put some in, I got to throw some away
'Cause I'm a player, some call us Macks
With private phones in our Cadillacs
From the womb to the tomb, we run our games
'Cause we're cold as ice, and we show no shame

[Break: Sound of cold wind blowing]

[Verse 4: Ice-T]
The ladies say that I'm heaven sent
'Cause I got more money than the US mint
I ride Rag-Top Rolls with rocks on my hand
Maseratis and Mercedes Benz
I have an ocean liner, private jets
Bel-Air bookies place my bets
I own islands off the coast of France
Now I wear designer shirts and pants
When I was brought into this world
My mamma never asked if I was a boy or a girl
First I rolled over to her, and gave her a kiss
She said: Your daddy don't rock me like this!
When the doctor hit me on the behind
I broke on down with a funky rhyme
The nurses said, I was awfully cute
When I played out a joint, in a three piece suit
Yo yo yo, please, please, please check it out
'Cause I'm a player, I'm always clean
I bought a Mercedes Benz when I was seventeen
From the womb to the tomb, I run my game
'Cause I'm cold as ice, and I show no shame

[Break: Sound of cold wind blowing]

[Verse 5: Ice-T]
Then I met this madam named Angel Adams (?)
She said she liked my style
She said sit down T, let me rap to you, for just a little while
She was a gravedigger, pulled .38 triggers
She's a lady in love and sent from above
She wasn't sly, she wasn't slick
Just made that money real quick
She had a way of getting it fast
It came from dealing in cold cash
She ran her game with the utmost ease
To break a player down to his knees
I said lady, put freeze on that rap, and
Prepare yourself for a heart attack
I took her by her hand, I said come with me
We drove off in my vicious eighty three
I took her to diner, I took her to the show
I took her to the Snooty cause she begged me to go
We got to the room, (?) man after long snaps
So she shook herself and broke herself came up with a gat
She went through the door, I didn't cut no slack
I had her on the floor, on her stomach, on her back
I had her on the wall, on the hall and on her knees
I put her in the hot tub and the water started to freeze
I took her out the hot tub then I put her on the floor
She said: "Ooh Ice-T, I can't take no more"
I put her in the bed then she looked up in the mirror
Screamed so loud, I think the East Coast could hear her
I rolled on my back, I put her on the top
She said: "Ooh Ice-T, will this ever stop?"
I said No! The freaking has just begun
We hit fifty more positions before I got done
When we've got finished, it was no longer dark
We had rocked so hard, made the Snooty Fox bark
Then she rolled over to me, she looked me in my eye
And said these words to my surprise
She said: I tried to catch you, cause I knew I could
I came here with you, cause I thought I should
I tried to freak you, cause I thought I could
But oohh baby, you sure are good
She said: baby you're one hell of a man
Ain't no better riding than Disney Land
Now to all you ladies that think you're fly
And can out freak the average guy
Don't ever come venturing through my door
I'll have begging to stop, while you're screaming for more
Yo, please check it out
All the ladies in the house come check it out
'Cause I'm a player with jewels on every hand
So deeply in pocket I control demand
But we all know how I earn my pay
'Cause you don't wanna work, when you got to play

[Break: Sound of cold wind blowing]

[Verse 6: Ice-T]
Brothers when you wine and dine a fox
You don't take her to McDonalds or to Jack In The Box
Don't pick her up, in a bus or a cab
She needs a black belt chauffeur and a cornice wrap
You can take her to dine at the finest spot
Or you take her to a disco that's really hot
You can take her home and while you're all alone
Don't forget to disconnect the phone
You can take her to the bed, you throw back the sheets
Rock her butt to the rhythm of the beat...

[Hook: Young Thug]
Heart attack, baby when you roll
You gone give me a heart attack
Don't slow it up baby roll it I want a heart attack
Gotta act just like you know you giving me a heart attack
I ain't never ever poppin back
I just want me a heart attack
Heart attack, heart attack, heart attack, heart attack
Heart attack, heart attack, heart attack
Picture me not doing well from a heart attack, from a heart attack

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Gotta have my Tinder on her
She don't want nun but that designer on her
I don't remember how many times I bone her
And she the bomb like Lotus Flower water
I ain't snitchin' but I told her I really wanna change into a pimp
Turn your little ass at Giuseppe store
All your jewelry on the wrist belt
5 pair of J pair of leather leather
Catch a dime by the strip club
And make you shake your little bitty tail feathers
Told her "baby girl, knock out, knock out" just like Mayweather
Only told you my two thighs on the other side of my fuckin' bed
She got a good job and her head perfect that's super head
She get inside the road then bust it open that Sufared
When we first started I'm like Superman now I'm super dead

[Hook: Young Thug]
Heart attack, baby when you roll
You gone give me a heart attack
Don't slow it up baby roll it I want a heart attack
Gotta act just like you know you giving me a heart attack

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Lamborghini with the doors up
Pull up and she chose up
Froze up so she chose us
Better ask these hoes, they know us
She watching me like a movie
Gucci Mane got his numbers up
Tell her, baby girl come over here, drop this ass right in front of us
Yea, she chose up, yea that bitch chose us
That bitch she chose up, the yellow bitch chose up
I got a dark skin friend and she fine as fuck
But when I hit the club she make them hoes choose up
Yea, they choose up
Jimmy Choo shoes up
Jimmy Choo glasses? That's just the shit my boo wear
I'm so inconsiderate, I'm not even caring
I got them big old diamond chains and thinking about marriage

[Hook: Young Thug]
Heart attack, baby when you roll
You gone give me a heart attack
Don't slow it up baby roll it I want a heart attack
Gotta act just like you know you giving me a heart attack

Picture me not doing well from a heart attack, from a heart attack

Oh pretty prince of parties, where does water go? (I let it flow)
Oh pretty prince of parties, can I come to your party? (No)
Oh pretty prince of parties, where do you get your clothes? (They're made of snow - pretty party clothes crocheted of snow)

[Verse 4]
I'm the mickey Māori minstrel
You're the high priestess of tinsel
I'm the guru god of ganja
Ramashalanka lanka Ravi Shankar

[Outro]
La la la la la la la la la la la la

[Verse 1]
It's what you do, it's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me

[Verse 2]
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm onto you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, I'm on to you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me

[Verse 3]
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you
You must be on to me

[Verse 4]
It's what we see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me
Me, me, me, me

[Bridge]
You want me? I walk down the hallway
You like it? The bedroom's my runway
Slap me! I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay

[Outro]
I'm onto you, you must be haunting me

[Verse 1]
Have you ever wondered where'd it all really went?
Wondered if you'd ever, ever find your dreams?
Wondered if you'd ever, ever find your dreams?
Wondered if life had never been that it seems?
Wondered if life is all about the high beams?
The flashin' light, tryin' to get your money right
And you be up all night, tryin' to stay fresh today
Fresh like Mr. West and I'm proudly the best
I been sold on to that guest
Uh, the number one on the charts
Why is that? Because I rap from the heart
What I always did from the start
How I always played my part
Uh, they thought I was so crazy, I got a deal with Jay Z
Now they got to pay me and they looked up lately
I sold a million the first week
'Member when I just sold my first beat
Shit can change and it never stayed the same
Ma, I wonder, I wonder what it would be now
What it would be now, you all standin' in the crowd
Ten thousand, now they hate everythin' now
Everythin' now
Or every single I dropped now, I dropped now
Tryin' do everythin' to keep shit hot now
And the media, they diss me, diss me
They say I'm so fuckin' evil
Ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo, what the fuck do he know?
Cause I'm gonna say my, my shit
And I'm gonna talk my, my shit
And they can suck my, my, my, my
I wonder why they talk so bad
Have they ever had a artist that's so mad?
And they will never realize what they have
Somebody real in the industry
If nobody's real, then I guess it's me
And they, "Freedom," and it's not free
Cause every time I talk freely they attack me
They give me backlash, backlash, backlash
Black, but they can kiss my ass, my ass, my ass, my ass
I say, "Why ask? Why ask? Why?"
Try but try, can they's fly?
Now touch the sky, touch the sky, touch the sky
And I wonder, baby, to can know what it means
What we know
And I wonder, baby, if you know what it means

[Verse 1]
And I'm just tryin' to play it cool
Wonderin' what you gon' do now
It's 11:15 and, baby, I got to hit you up
Are you playin' around? Oh, what now?
Tell me what's that's
12:35 and you sayin' that you ain't been to text
And that you're on your way, well, okay, okay
What I'm sayin', don't say it, don't say it
Now it's 1:15 and, baby, you got to be playin'
Baby, you have got to be playin'
Where are you?
Are you comin' back? Still callin' through
And she say she at the club with her girl
And it's her girl's birthday and she keepin' her there longer
And, uh, you know how that goes
And she want to see me so bad
Oh, so she's leavin' in about fifteen minutes
After this, uh, one favorite Pitbull song plays, goes off
Or some shit like that, now it's like, uh, 2:45
And you know what type of textses niggas send at that time
I texted her and I said, "Are you alive?"
That's when you send that text
And you say, "Hey, are you alive?"
Cause the only reason why you not here
Bitch, you better have died
Bitch, you better have died
Bitch, you better have died
Now it's like 3:30 and you tell me that you're on your way
And a nigga so goddamn horny
You know what I said? "Okay"
I'm just sayin', "Okay"
Who you gon' listen to: Your ego or your dick?
Now the dick wins
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
And I can't understand, holdin' a white wine
BlackBerry in my hand
Lookin' at the time, 7 a.m
I can't believe this bitch sent me through this shit again
Oh, you got me, huh?
Are you gon' give me every chance you get?
You gon' give me every chance you get?
I don't know when you're gonna quit
This why I left your ass in the first place
This why I helped your ass in the first case
And you don't have the nerve to text a nigga
I left the door cracked open
New York City is dangerous, I could have been robbed
New York City is dangerous, I could have been robbed
What you think?
I would take that chance for some pussy moanin'
This the type of pussy you risk your life for
This the type of pussy you leave your wife for
This the type of pussy you spend the night over
This the type of pussy you spend the night over
This the type of pussy you spend the night over
And look at me, tryin' spend the night over
And I'll admit it
Even though I'm disrespected as a motherfucker
I still, still want to hit it
Got an ass like that cause I paid your ass again
My friends say, "What the fuck is wrong with them?"
Cause ain't no sex like a ex
Ain't no sex like your ex
Ain't no sex like your ex, ain't no sex like
You know, cause you'd be so mad at that motherfucker
And you know they got a new motherfucker
And you know you just want to fuck her
And prove that the next nigga ain't as good as you
And he can't do what you do
So, baby, if you give me one chance to dance
Put the devil in a purple light
If you give me one chance to dance
Put the devil in a purple light
Alright, don't say, don't say
Where she'll stop, I'll never know, don't say
Where did all the lovers go?
Where she'll stop, I'll never know
Where did all the lovers go?
Where she'll stop, I'll never know
Where did all the lovers go?
Where she'll stop, I'll never know
So, hey, so, hey
Don't say you, don't say you will
Hey, don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey, don't say, don't say, don't say you will, you will

[Chorus]
I go to Jacob with twenty-five thou
You go with twenty-five hundred, wow
I got eleven plaques on my wall right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow

[Verse 1]
H to the Izzo, did three thou spins in a week
You did a thou in a month, wow
Y'all niggas want credit, but y'all need to slow down
Kanye to The killin' y'all from Chi-Town
How your wife gon' say she never sold drugs a day in her life
But she still wanna pump the yay
And y'all mad cause y'all not knowin'
Cause these canaries so yellow
When y'all pull up, whether to stop or keep goin'
I got Gs, rock, rock and roll tees with no sleeves
Tats showin', tucked in, strap showin'
How he get seven TVs in that 'Lac, 'Lac?
Three in the front, two in the back, two in that back, back
While you in that hatchback and tryin' to sell work
And don’t get shit from them packs back
And try to rap, the studio gon' give you your daps back
And try to get published
And all you get is your ass capped and that’s that

[Chorus]
I go to Jacob with twenty-five thou
You go with twenty-five hundred, wow
I got eleven plaques on my wall right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow

[Verse 2]
I just bought my mom a new car and a house
And that's a lot to say for a college dropout
I drove to New York with ten dollars to my name
And brought back a couple platinum plaques on the plane
And brought back that soul shit that changed the game
They have no beat, they had to aim the stain, the steel
Got lizards in my R. Kelly strain
They real, man, I swear to God I wish I had a dollar bill
For every time a nigga told me, "Stick to the beats"
I could've ate at Cheesecake at least six times a week
I got killed these niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise-colored Benz, I push miracle whips
Gonna save purple haze and some syrup to sip
It have you so right, you drive on the left lane
Gettin' head, crash
Your head hit the window, now that's brain

[Verse 1]
Number one, so together I'm eleven
She's a ten, I'm number one, together we eleven
Her friend only a seven, sent her to 7-Eleven
She a ten, she a seven, that make 'em seventeen
Let me see your ID, only seventeen?
Eesh, that could have fucked up everythin'
Nike, already don't like me, always on a white tee
Dressed like I'm hypebeast, signed through my white tee
Dont race against the American dream
Together we like the Kenyan marathon team
Three black rap acts that spit that crack
Never pushed that 'Lac, rather push somethin' German
Lookin' for a Swedish bitch that I could put my sperm in
Preach, my brother, gon' start the sermon
All I see is green, call me Erick Sermon
All I spit is thermal, long-sleeved flannel
When I touch the verse, don't touch the channel
Bought the rat a purse, she keep callin' it Chanel
Never hit a bitch anal, but I run shit annual
Now that's some dumb shit
I never hit a bitch anal, but I run shit, dumb bitch
And I mean that in a nicer sense to the word
Just act like I'm some type of nice sensitive nerd
I don't fiend female dogs
Cause I done dogged all females
Except for the ones that's only in it for the retail
She see what you got, she see what we sell
Get married so much, I swear them girls on resell
She watchin' the draft, she got your jersey already
She 'bout to pick out her crib in Jersey already
She 'bout to be pregnant by Thursday already
Congratulations, baby boy, on your new baby boy

[Hook]
Here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am
Here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Verse 1]
I'll never be picture perfect Beyoncé
Be light as Al B. or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet?
He was as black as the street was
I never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people'd reach a
Fake ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up?
You see how I played the big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I'd never rock a mink coat in the summertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the wintertime like will.i.am
Let me know if you feel it, man
Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Hook]
Damn, here we go again
People not sayin' what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Verse 2]
And I'm back to tear it up
Haters, start your engines, I hear 'em gearin' up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get they hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
Cause they want gun talk or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks or Adidos
Can they add that he just spazzed out at that show?
So say goodbye to the NAACP award
Goodbye to the India.Arie award
They'd rather give me the Ni-Nigga Please award
But I'll just take the I Got A Lot of Cheese award

[Hook]
Damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
Everybody talkin', but when it hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Bridge]
Keep the pianos goin', goin', goin', goin', goin'
And I'll keep flowin', flowin'
I got to keep it goin', goin', goin'
And I'm a keep flowin', flowin'
And I'll keep flowin', flowin'
And I'll keep flowin', flowin', flowin'

[Verse 3]
When I wrote this dope shit, what I noticed was so bogus
A lot of people talk about you when you growin' up
But you got to stay focused
People who was number one in school end up like smokers
People you talk the most about
No doubt, sometimes end up the dopest
Anybody know they can't touch the way I flow
I guess it was the way I run from school to school
And sometimes wasn't treaten cool and broke all the rules
And always ended up in the office like Michael Scott
Now I got rings like Michael got
That's Jordan, let me tell you somethin' more important
You think I wrote this, no, it just comes off the top of my
Whatever topic I
Stop it, I'm probably the best out, Mr. West out
Yo, don't nobody want to bout
I knock people out in the first round. the first down
Hear the touchdown, y'all don't even want to clown
With the red shoes on just to let you know I'm freestylin'
Yes, ill, I'm wilin'
I see you, uh, at the mall to show this is my mornin' flow
So imagine my midnight sight when I ignite lyrically
I just might, everybody just bite
When I wrote this, I was picturin' a little girl in high school
With people pickin' on her, tellin' her what she not
Then she'd grow up to be model, so they'll be hot
And everything she not made her slam it
Everything she not made it everything she am
That's incorrect English, but I'm way too distinguished
Can understand this, I rock the planets
Cameras be candid, on, I was lookin' at my prior image
My wire image, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy endin', get it?

[Hook]
Damn, damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Bridge]
And I'm a keep goin', goin', goin'
And I'm a keep flowin', flowin', flowin'
And you just keep goin', goin', goin'
And I'm a keep flowin', flowin', flowin'

[Outro] (x3)
Now when they get hard, I need you to keep goin', goin', goin'
And I'm a keep flowin', flowin', flowin'
And one day you gon' show them, show them, show them
And one day you gon' show them, show them, show them

[Hook]
Just like I told you, you must learn

It's calm yet wild the style that I speak
Just filled with facts and you will never get weak in the heart
In fact you'll start to illuminate, knowledge to others in a song
Let me demonstrate the force of knowledge
Knowledge reigned supreme
The ignorant is ripped to smithereens
What do you mean when you say I'm rebellious
Cause I don't accept everything that you're telling us
What are you selling us the creator dwellin' us
I sit in your unknown class while you're failing' us
I failed your class cause I ain't with your reasoning
You're tryin' make me you by seasoning
Up my mind with see Jane run, see John walk in a hardcore New York
Come on now, that's like a chocolate cow
It doesn't exist no way, no how
It seems to me that in a school that's ebony
African history should be pumped up steadily, but it's not
And this has got to stop, See Spot run, run get Spot
Insulting to a Black mentality, a Black way of life
Or a jet Black family, so I include with one concern, that
You must learn

[Hook x2]

I believe that if you're teaching history
Filled with straight up facts no mystery
Teach the student what needs to be taught
Cause Black and White kids both take shorts
When one doesn't know about the other ones' culture
Ignorance swoops down like a vulture
Cause you don't know that you ain't just a janitor
No one told you about Benjamin Banneker
A brilliant Black man that invented the almanac
Can't you see where KRS is coming at
With Eli Whitney, Haile Selassie
Granville Woods made the walkie-talkie
Lewis Latimer improved on Edison
Charles Drew did a lot for medicine
Garrett Morgan made the traffic lights
Harriet Tubman freed the slaves at night
Madam C.J. Walker made the straightening comb;
But you won't know this is you weren't shown
The point I'm gettin' at it it might be harsh
Cause we're just walkin' around brainwashed
So what I'm sayin' is not to diss a man
We need the 89 school system
One that caters to a Black return because
You must learn

[Hook]

"Alkebulan" is the original name
Of Africa, now stripped of it's fame
It's good to know that in ancient times
Egyptians developed all sciences of the mind
To the point where they ruled the planet
But Rome, Greece, and Persia wasn't havin' it
They attacked, and won the war
But it wasn't enough, they had to get to the core
Cause in that time it was Alkebulan
That ruled religion, politics, and man
In order to destroy the Egyptian race
They had to wipe the sciences from off the face of the planet
So they proceeded to ban it
Then replace it with Christianity
And it's, been that way, all the way to today
Learn what we teach; hear what we say
But here comes the K-the-R-the-S-the-O-the-N-the-E
The BDP and we rhyme intelligently
Let me continue with Theodosyius
A Greek ruler not known to most of us
He, in the fourth century A.D.,
Calls the Egyptians fools you see
Two years later, Justinian rules
Six A.D., was it for schools
As a result, ignorance had swirled
Over Christian Europe and Greco-Roman worlds
This went on for a thousand years
Of ignorance, stupidity, and tears
Now comes the seventeenth century hardness
Europe, began
