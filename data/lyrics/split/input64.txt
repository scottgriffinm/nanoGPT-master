Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player
Drop, drop it for me

Wake up with no jammies (Nope)
Lobster tail for dinner

Got, got it if you want it
Said you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now

Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

[Verse 3: Bruno Mars]
I'm talkin' trips to Puerto Rico
Say the word and we go
You can be my freaka
Girl, I'll be a fleeko, mamacita
I will never make a promise that I can't keep
I promise that your smile ain't gon' never leave
Shopping sprees in Paris
Everything 24 karats
Take a look in that mirror
Now tell me who's the fairest
Is it you? (is it you?) Is it me? (is it me?)
Say it's us (say it's us) and I'll agree, baby

How you gonna let me know?
When the moment comes to show you
What we like to talk about
Listen to me, (?) just where
I know

Where you’ll be

Just when I might come on running
Just when I might come around
I know you won’t be wondering where I’ve been half the time
No word of reassurances from the other side
So I wonder if I did it right

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1: Shelley FKA DRAM & 2-D]
Where it, where it, where it
Where it all goes down
Where it, where it, where it
Where it, where it, where it
Where it all goes down
Where it, where it, where it
Where it all goes down
Where it, take it
Where it, take it
Where it, take it

[Break: Shelley FKA DRAM]
Where it all goes down
Where it all goes down

[Verse 2: 2-D & Shelley FKA DRAM]
Outside, cold and ghosting out with jet lag
I took it to the right man
Took it all back
When the courts were closing
It was Bobby gracing, I know that
(When it all goes down)
A bullet to the right man
He pulled it back

[Bridge: ZHU]
I'm gonna miss you and this moment
I'm gonna miss you undivided
I'm gonna miss you and this moment
I'm gonna miss you undivided

[Outro: Shelley FKA DRAM & 2-D]
Where it all goes down
Where it all goes down
Where it all goes down
Take it in your heart now, lover
Where it all goes down
Take it in your heart now, lover
Time is passing slowly for the eight year old next door
But mama's watch is ticking off the wall
Jillian and Bobby think that they're a perfect pair
But girls could say he's just a bit too tall

You don't have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view

He hated pink so she threw out her favorite clothes
His NFL was turned to TLC
Baby's got an attitude and thinks they just don't know
But they all do and wish that she could see
You don't have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view

In the least or masterpiece
Depends on one's opinion
Worst of all they never call
But don't think that they weren't wishing

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view
It's all in your point of view
Point of view
It's all in your point of view
You're always trying
To hide in the night
And blink at the door
You'd let it go
Though you'll never know
When it all may be gone
We close our heart
We shut down our world
To rumors you know
Tore down the shield
Your future reveals
Where the feel's yet to go

You've gotta open up your mind and feel the love in your life
You've got to open up your heart feel the love in your life
You've gotta open up your mind and feel the love in your life
You've got to open up your heart feel the love in your life
Love in your lifer heart
And feel love in the light

They won't decide
Watch time glassing by
Then float away
You can't get ill
Just typewrite on in
To the rows we could play
Dissatisfied
You always have tried
To divert with goodbyes
Though what you seek
Who knows it could be
Right in front of your eyes
You've gotta open up your mind and feel the love in your life
You've got to open up your heart feel the love in your life
You've gotta open up your mind and feel the love in your life
You've got to open up your heart feel the love in your life
Love in your life

(Repeat to the end)
Outer space is the only place to hide now
From whoever wants to know where you are
Everything is easier than ever
When we fall baby we fall so hard

First conferred when the primates tried to warn me
When Adam ran off to make a fire
Mother Nature whispered to the apes now
We'll rebuild this place when they are gone

I was just another one
Waiting for the bees to come
I was Mother Nature's son
But I was just another one
Just another one
Oh

[Verse 1]
Well, the air is still but we are moving
I like the wind so wind the windows down

[Chorus]
Oh!
See my flow
So we all

[Verse 2]
And now come back down again
Makes me wonder how I ever felt so good

[Chorus]
Oh!
So alone
Feel it all
Flows down
Oh!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I'm already gone
I'm already gone
Wake me when you're done
Let me feel your flow

[Chorus]
Feel my flow
Feel at home
Feel alone

[Intro: Banx & Ranx]
Yeah, Banx & Ranx

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Mama Mavis, oh
Mama, they tried my patience
Obama is gone, who is left to save us?
So together we mourn, I'm praying for my neighbours
They say the devil's at work and Trump is calling favours
You say I'm dangerous, I speak for the nameless
I fly with the vultures, I be with them bangers
If change don't come, then the change won't come
If the bands make 'em dance, then the rain gon' come
(Woo!)

[Pre-Chorus: Mavis Staples]
Am I passin' into the light?
(Am I looking into mercy's eyes?)
Look into your eyes
All the world is out of your hands
(Then ascending into the dark)
You got to die a little if you wanna live
Change come to pass
Change come to pass
You'd best be ready for it

[Chorus: 2-D & Mavis Staples]
Something I've begun to fear is about to change its form
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in times
But I won't get tired at all
You'd best be ready for it
Something I've begun to fear is about to change its form
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in times
But I won't get tired at all

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Look into my eyes, mama, tell me what you see
Tell me there's a chance for me to make it off the streets
Tell me that I won't die at the hands of the police
Promise me I won't outlive my nephew and my niece
Promise me my pastor isn't lyin' as he preach
Tell me that they'll listen if it's lessons that I teach
Tell me there's a heaven in the sky where there is peace
But until then, I keep my piece in arm's reach
(Ahh!)

[Pre-Chorus: Mavis Staples]
Am I passin' into the light?
(Am I looking into mercy's eyes?)
All the world is out of your hands
(Then ascending into the dark)
You got to die a little if you wanna live
Change coming
You'd best be ready for it

[Chorus: 2-D & Mavis Staples]
Something I've begun to fear is about to change its form
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in times
But I won't get tired at all
You'd best be ready for it
Something I've begun to fear is about to change its form
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in times
But I won't get tired at all

[Outro: Mavis Staples]
You'd best be ready for it

[Refrain]
Paint me silver and call me Hermann Hesse
If I ever, ever touch your pouch again

[Verse 1]
The power to devour all the creeping things he made
Slip up in the shower singing "home-made lemonade"
Bring me Louis Cartier, I need a diamond halo
For me and my seven billion brothers

[Chorus]
I never know what to do, babe
But that's not nothing new, babe
I'm the champion of the few, babe
But I never know what to do, babe
Do, babe, ooh

[Verse 2]
Soldiers and the children still shivving in the Jago
And whoever runs the ship for the others

[Chorus]
I never know what to do, babe
But that's not nothing new, babe
I'm the champion of the few, babe
But I never know what to do, babe
Do, babe, ooh, babe

[Bridge]
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me

[Refrain]
Paint me silver and call me Hermann Hesse
If I ever, ever touch your pouch again

[Chorus]
I never know what to do, babe
But that's not nothing new, babe
I'm the champion of the few, babe, oh, oh
But I never know what to do, babe
Do, babe, do, babe, ooh, babe
Never know what to do, babe (Save me)
But that's not nothing new, babe (Save me)
I'm the champion of the few, babe (Save me)
But I never know what to do, babe (Save me)

[Outro]
Save me
Save me

[Outro: 2-D]
I'm in the stakin' bar
I got debts, I'm a debaser
Saturnz about to make love
And I'm just a heartbreaker
And I won't get a take in
'Cause I'm out when I'm stakin'
And the rings I am breaking
Are making you a personal debt

[Verse 1: 2-D]
When the passing looks to die for
Take it in your heart now, lover
When the case is out
And tired and sodden
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart

[Chorus: Shelley FKA DRAM]
Back to when it was cool
'Cause there's no substitute
Who even knows the truth?
The truth, the truth

[Bridge: 2-D]
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart

[Verse 2: 2-D & Shelley FKA DRAM]
Outside, cold and ghosting out with jet lag
I took it to the right man
Took it all back
When the courts were closing
It was Bobby gracing
I know that
A bullet to the right man
He pulled it back

[Chorus: Shelley FKA DRAM]
Back to when it was cool
'Cause there's no substitute
Who even knows the truth?
The truth, the truth

[Verse 3: 2-D]
Caught in your eyes
Stacks of lights
Come streaming back
Make it for the best times
Growing pains, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times

[Bridge: 2-D & Shelley FKA DRAM]
Take it in your heart now lover
Where it all goes down

[Shelley FKA DRAM]
It was Bobby gracing
A bullet to the right man

[Chorus: Shelley FKA DRAM]
Back to when it was cool
'Cause there's no substitute
Who even knows the truth?
The truth, the truth

[2-D]
Take it in your heart now lover
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart now

[Outro: 2-D & Shelley FKA DRAM]
Where it all goes down
Take it in your heart now lover
Take it in your heart now lover
Where it all goes down

[Verse 1]
Hey
There's a battle raging on
And you fight all day
You try to figure it out
You don't think
That she's ready for a change
That she's tired of the way you've handled yourself

[Chorus]
And you gotta know
She's gonna leave you
She's gonna leave you
She's gonna leave you
She's gonna leave you
(No more)
She's gonna leave you
(No more)
She's gonna leave you
(No more, no more)

[Verse 2]
You say
You don't think
You don't think
You can change
So you sulk and sit
And you act like you're ahead of the game
And it's getting old

[Bridge]
So just let her slip away
Every time you try again you just keep in the pain

[Chorus]
And you gotta know
She's gonna leave you
She's gonna leave you
She's gonna leave you
She's gonna leave you
(No more)
She's gonna leave you
(No more)
She's gonna leave you
(No more, No more)

[Verse 3]
Someone's gonna come through
Someone's gonna come through for you
Someone's gonna come through
Someone's gonna come through for you

[Chorus]
Cause
She's gonna leave you
She's gonna leave you
(No more)
She's gonna leave you
(No more)
She's gonna leave you
(No more)
She's gonna leave you
She's gonna leave you
(And you don't know why)

[Verse 1]
In the beginning
God created Heaven and Earth
For what it's worth, I think that he might've created you first
Just my opinion
Your body is the one paradise that I wanna fly to
Every day and every night

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah

[Chorus]
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I’ve got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

[Verse 2]
Don’t matter what’s written
We can start all over again, all over again
Oh, how can I get you all over my skin?
My deep intuition tells me that I'm doing you wrong
If I don't come home
Just say you forgive me and don't let me go

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah

[Chorus]
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I’ve got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

[Bridge]
You know
I'll roar like a lion for you
You know I'll keep trying
'Til the sun stops rising

[Chorus]
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, hey
I got a condo in Manhattan
Baby girl, what's hatnin'
You and your ass invited
So gon' and get to clappin'
So pop it for a player
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player
Drop, drop it for me
I'll rent a beach house in Miami
Wake up with no jammies (Nope)
Lobster tail for dinner
Julio serve that scampi (Julio!)
You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now

[Pre-Chorus]
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

[Chorus]
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

[Verse 2]
I'm talkin' trips to Puerto Rico
Say the word and we go
You can be my freaka
Girl, I'll be a fleeko, mamacita
I will never make a promise that I can't keep
I promise that your smile ain't gon' never leave

[Pre-Chorus]
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

[Chorus]
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

[Outro]
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

[Verse 1]
We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize I really want to put you on
I’ve been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won’t you be my inspiration?
Be the real love that I need

[Chorus]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
I’m out to have a real love

[Verse 2]
Oooo woo, When I met you I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I’m not the one
So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love

[Chorus]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
I’m out to have a real love

[Bridge]
Love so true, and oh baby, I thought that love was true
I thought that you were the answer to the question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong, if I stay strong maybe I’ll find a
Real love

[Verse 3]
So I’ve tried my best and prayed to God He’ll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all
Ill give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall

[Chorus]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
I’m out to have a real love
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
I’m out to have a real love

[Outro](Chorus)
See I'm searching for a real love and I don't know where to go
Been around the world and high and low and still I never know
How it feels to have a real love cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way cause it seems he can't be found

[Chorus]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
I’m out to have a real love
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
I’m out to have a real love

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]

Pistol popping

My girl made him wait 'til the hours of the night
Then hit you with the, "You know it's mid, right?"
Can't be on time for the free rides
Can't be my type, I'm a low life
Crammed in some time, now I'm your whole life

Somewhere in your nights you're stuck when you think of me
Despite the life I lead
All this life in me
Spirits watch me, pants down

Throw team on back like I tatted the Mariah (Know I got some sins on me)
Then get the scream mask for the vert rides (Ridin')
Weed smoke in the sky, picture what I'm realizin' (Got some sins on me)
Ain't seen rainbows in the sky since college
This thing won't last unless we're both lyin' (Both lyin', yeah)
Fake flowers, no water needed
Real life drowned by the weekend
No "whens", call it timeless
No ends 'cause you're timeless (Timeless)

[Chorus]
Despite our history, yeah
Somewhere in your nights you're stuck when you think of me
Despite the life I lead
All this life in me (All this life)
Spirits watch me, pants down

I feel their smiles on me (On me, on me, on me)
I feel their smiles on me

This is where the magic happens
Aw man

[Chorus: DMX]
The bark in me
It's the dog in me
So pop the leash 'cuz ain't no walkin' me
Jump a muthafucka like there's a frog in me
All on me
Nuthin' but war to me (C'mon!)

The bark in me
It's the dog in me
So pop the leash 'cuz ain't no walkin' me

[Post-Chorus: Tariah]
Let the dog out let the dog out

The dog in me that gives me what I need
The dog in me they think it's a disease
So let me be what ima be
Let you see the dog in me (oooh)

[Verse 1:  C-Tru]
I don't ever cry
'Cuz I already died
And I don't need to fly
'Cuz I'm already high
And all these snakes wanna know 'bout what I feel inside
I wanna dig up a grave and bury them inside (goodbye)
So what's up, homie
What you want from me?
I'm bad by myself I depend on me only
I survive solely, on the grace of God, homie
I need to find my way so I ask that He show me
So I pray, Our Father, then Hail Mary, Glory be to God tell me can you hear me
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I inspect each step 'cuz I fear what's next
'Cuz in my mind, I'm dumping on you bastards
Leaving closed caskets, burning you with battery acids
And if you think my reaction is drastic
I'll wrap you in plastic, leave you stretched out like Mr. Fantastic

[Chorus: DMX]
The bark in me
It's the dog in me
So pop the leash 'cuz ain't no walkin' me

The dog in me they think it's a disease
So let me be what ima be
Let you see the dog in me (oooh)

[Verse 2:  C-Tru]
Did you know I been through hell already?
OD'ed already, almost died already?
No irie, kinda like Ox in Belly
So if the Lord wants to take my life I'm ready 'cuz...
The world got me going insane
It's like a full time job to lock the dog away
But it will break out so you best watch out
'Cuz ya can't talk shit with a dick in yo mouth
No one iller with the butterfly trigger
Rapid fire rap with with a flow so killah
Hit and run kill ya with an 18-wheeler
Then leave you like the walking dead MJ thriller
And I know I should join society
And follow laws and say apologies
But I just can't 'cuz their hypocrisy
Just bothers me, it's just the dog in me! (woo!)

[Chorus: DMX]
The bark in me
It's the dog in me
So pop the leash 'cuz ain't no walkin' me

I'm gon' let it, gon' let it
Let the dog out, I said it
Got me off the chain so now you gonna get it
Now I'm doing bad and I just might regret it (Hey!)
Now the henny got me faded, baby
Hit swisher get it twisted, baby
'Cuz I live like today is my last, so I'm living fast ain't afraid to blast
Now you think you got me figured me out
When you see me shut ya mouth
So no apologies
I know just what you want, it's the dog in me

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
See you peepin' out the peep hole
Gamblin' with your life, nigga, Cee-Lo
Three stripes and they're all green gold
Three strikes in a row mean go
And you die slow, oh
Nigga, die slow
I screamed when I saw the titties on Janet Jackson
I'm screamin' from the top of the planet
They first saw my swag, they was laughin'
But my bitch bad, she leavin' damage
I'm higher than a mothafuckin' ladder
I'm ballin', I'm ballin' on all you scrubs
Got you ridin' in your foreign, you livin' it up
Front's 21's and the back's on them dubs
Jeffery got a mink on, he look like a cub
Ridin' in the Rozay away from the world
Oasis on and I'm feelin' a grudge
Oasis on when I'm seein' you girl
Oasis on and I'm seein' the dust
Oasis on and I'm feelin' like water
Oasis on when I'm servin' the plugs
Oasis on when I'm servin' these drugs
Off white molly, I sniff it off her
All of y'all on hold on while I tangle my buzz
All white hoes puttin' dick in their guts
All type of hoes puttin' dick in their guts
Bad black hoes, they drinkin' the cum
Told her when she cum I wanna drink a lil' some
Molly bite down, man, I need me some gum
Cop me a Sudan I'ma gon' turn up a bomb

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Now when you slide on me, you slide on me
You slide on peace out, yeah
That's a free slide on me, first time's on me
Next time won't be, oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
For your mentality you play ball
You run 5 on 5 least three times a week
Glen Park down the street
Waitin' on you to tire
Retire with victory, play so savagely
Always fighting with them you grew up with
When you lose you don't cry but you lowkey sad to see
If we cut like some champions you'll redeem yourself
You'll sleep happily, uh-haha, smiling
I'm still working while you dream pop
I could never let a scene stop smilin' on me
I don't think they get the point pop
They forgettin' that it's me, akh
Akhi tell 'em I ain't gone, wallahi
I'm just all day running numbers
How the fuck you think I live?
Too many heads waitin' for my downfall
They're like "something's gotta give"
Boys in the building give me updates like they know the weather
If you ain't in the streets you can't see the sky, I'm out here
I could see the sky and it's paradise
On the regular

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Now when you slide on me, you slide on me
You slide on peace out, yeah
That's a free slide on me, first time's on me
Next time won't be, oh yeah

[Outro]
This is for when you change your mind and slide back this way
This is for that night when set backs won't let that much fade
Guess you can't blame the ones you choose

[Verse 1]
Well my love, she vanished in the cold
August moon, way too soon
So I got up, put on my warmest coat
Took a stroll, September cold

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Well I just can't sit around here waiting
Waiting for her to get back home
So for now, you'll find me on the run
I've got no lemon drops, no bubblegum

[Chorus]
Candy, candy, candy, candy wrappers alone
Cloud the floor of my dirty room
Candy, candy, candy, candy wrappers alone
Brushin' my teeth I clean them
And oh, my sweet tooth gone

[Verse 2]
When the sun just won't shine on
I'll be gone, to yip and yeah
If the stars come fallin' from the night
I'll ignite my ride and cruise

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well I just can't sit around here waiting
Baking my s'mores upon the stove
Well I just can't sit around here and fake it anymore
No gummy bears left on my pillow
Whoa, oh

[Chorus]
Candy, candy, candy, candy wrappers alone
Crowd the floor of my dirty room
Candy, candy, candy, candy wrappers alone
Brushin' my teeth, I clean them
And oh, my sweet tooth.... gone

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Candy, candy, candy, candy wrappers alone
Crowd the floor, dirty room
Candy, candy, candy, candy wrappers alone
Brushin' my teeth I clean them
And oh, my sweet tooth gone

[Intro]
Kid! (Yo?)
Kid, I got to do this
I got the noise, I got to do this, man
Then pump the big noise, c'mon in the house
(Lay down your funky weapon)
Yeah y'all, here we go
Pumpin' the big noise in the 90's

[Verse 1]
This here rap's about the true confession
If you listen close you about to learn a lesson
You must know failure before success
Now this is the failure I must confess (well)
I was hanging onto life trying deal with this
Playing the games, almost got dismissed
Cocaine was the thing that I took on
And nowhere was the place that I was going

[Chorus]
Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Makin' love and music's the only things worth fighting for
We are the New Power Generation - we wanna change the
World
(Twin Cities in your house, Twin Cities in the house)
The only thing that's in our way is you, ooh
(Twin Cities in our house, Twin Cities in my house)
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas
(Twin Cities in the house, Twin Cities in the house)
We're sick and tired of you tellin' us what to do, ooh
(Twin Cities in the house, Twin Cities in the house)

[Verse 2]
I must tell the truth, I cannot lie
I was headed for the kill, steal, destroy, and die
Top to the bottom to bottom to top
Success is where I'm headed there is no doubt
Success is something that we all want
But the truth is what we need to reach our point
I had to give this message the so-called truth
I hope it's something in it that's there for you

[Chorus]
Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Makin' love and music's the only things worth fighting for
We are the New Power Generation - we wanna change the
World
(Twin Cities in your house, Twin Cities in the house)
The only thing that's in our way is you, ooh
(Twin Cities in our house, Twin Cities in my house)
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas
(Twin Cities in the house, Twin Cities in the house)
We're sick and tired of you tellin' us what to do, ooh
(Twin Cities in the house, Twin Cities in the house)

Twin Cities in the house
Twin Cities in the house
Twin Cities in the house
Twin Cities in the house

[Verse 3]
Like I said before, I'ma tell you again
Success is something that's deep within
So remember the truth - you can't go wrong
The flesh is weak but the spirit is strong

[Chorus]
Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Makin' love and music's the only things worth fighting for
We are the New Power Generation - we wanna change the
World
(Twin Cities in your house, Twin Cities in the house)
The only thing that's in our way is you, ooh
(Twin Cities in our house, Twin Cities in my house)
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas
(Twin Cities in the house, Twin Cities in the house)
We're sick and tired of you tellin' us what to do, ooh
(Twin Cities in the house, Twin Cities in the house)

[Modified Chorus]
Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Makin' love and music's the only things worth fighting for
We are the New Power Generation - we wanna change the
World
This here rap's about the true confession
The only thing that's in our way is you, ooh
This here rap's about the true confession
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas
This here rap's about the true confession
We're sick and tired of you tellin' us what to do, ooh
This here rap's about the true confession

[Chorus]
Open up, countin' up, going hard, passing out
Waking up, counting up, going hard
I dont want to go home

[Possible Verse]
Talking the game Im on top of the list
Walk in this thing I look stylish as shit

[Intro: Snoop Dogg, Redman]
Ayy ayy step back motherfucker, watch out!
La la la la la we don’t give a fuck
Ayy y’all niggas ain’t fucking with us, nigga
La la la la la
I'ma get it like this nigga

[Verse 1: Redman]
Yo I got the green, Don Juan
I’m in the hood, blow the horn, bom-bom
This pimping ain't for free, here’s a coupon
My backwoods packs I turn to a futon
I got my eyes on seven figures
And I'ma get it whether I move crooked like Jack Thriller’s
I’m shitting on 'em, I smell like a winner
Don't hit the bathroom for like 40/45 minutes
Redman and we up in this bitch, huh
I never cruise, I work to be the top gun
And I’m a dog off the collar, the marijuana globetrotters
You got bud, I holler

[Hook: Redman]
Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)
Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)

[Verse 2: B-Real]
It's the four horsemen call reinforcements
We ain't looking for endorsements, we absorb your portions
We can roll the indo or sativa if you need to
Got a warehouse poppin' with the B she's a heater
Two on the lighter with tightest bitches, dancing getting higher
They all fire ladies never tire
Got her soul inspired now we flossing out
Sipping on some Hen 2.0, for your cotton mouth
This beat is banging like a Cali block in the 90s
Really fucking grimey and the po-po's right behind me
16's popping, smoke blowing out the window
When we roll up in the spot it's very simple

[Break: Method Man]
Uh, yeah, uh-uh
That's what you do
Mt. Kushmore in the building
Big Snoop, Method Man, Redman, B-Real
Shout out to Wiz Khalifa and Sen Dog, you know! G-yeah!

[Verse 3: Method Man]
I ain't here to bring the East back (nah), I'm here to relapse
And now I'm outta rehab they ask me where the weed at
Go get a weed app (homie), I got that weed that have your P.O getting P.O, ask me where to pee at
My G, pack the streets of New York, I give em G-Rap
I'm cool, on the road to riches to get my G back
I'll bee dat! Killa Beez mind your beeswax
Past 10 o'clock when ya still don't know where your seat at
Ask Big Snoop, it don't take a Crip to see that
Be real, what you read about Meth Man, believe that
I'm nice, I gots no chill, go get a ski hat
In fact, put ya twitter on ice, chill with the feedback

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
From the days of Cheech & Chong, to Willie Nelson
Everywhere that I go, I blow fo sho, you smelled it
A lot of y'all fucking with me, saying I'm on your bucket list
But I ain't the one to be fucking with
See, I'm like a quick game of tic-tac-toe
Take three in a row
Aye lil nigga, gon hit that door
I'm back with my niggas Earth wind, no snow
And I got the fire on Mt. Kushmore
So let it rain like the leaves of a cannabis plant
When I say it, I mean it as a matter of fact
Well I outta, slip mo dick in your daughter, for starters
Leafs by Snoop, may I take your order?

[Hook: Redman]
Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)
Ayo this one nigga that roll up that smoke
When I hit the weed spot, my pockets go broke
We high, we high, we high, we high (say it again)

[Outro: Redman]
Ain't nobody fucking with my dogs
I leave that hammer of side of me
Ain't nobody fucking with my dogs
Ain't nobody fucking with my dogs
Ain't nobody fucking with my dogs
I leave that hammer of side of me
Ain't nobody fucking with my dogs...

[Pre-Hook:]
I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, fake
Soon as I wake up keep an eye out for
The snakes, yeah  

[

Hook:]
'Cause I don't need no, fraud
I don't no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that chick up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, and lift that chick up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

[Verse 1:]
Aye yo, throw your wrist-es up, all my chicks is up
Illonis girls is wussier than what?
All them chicks is done
All my real people down to ride, throw your GSXRs up
I ain't in the projects, but all my bricks is up
You can't be Pablo if your work ain't sellin'
What the (wooh) is this chick inhalin'?
I woulda helped you out that pit you fell in
I am the generous king! Ask Ms. Ellen
Tried to pull another one you was itchin' to scrap
You exposed your bestfriend, now you wish it was scrapped
Heard your stuff was on yuck, I guess you needed a Pap
What type of bum chick leave a friend over a rack?
Who ruins a 2 year friendship over a Zak?
Lil' Glen Ellyn basic chick thinkin' she back
Back to back, oh you mean, back to wack?
"Back to Back"? Me and Noah laughed at that
They say numbers don't matter, but when they discussin' the kings
They turn around and say Lebron ain't got six rings
You never rejected me, lol you wild dumb
That's why Jack told all yo' secrets now yous real done
Miss HM, this is war till the very end
I got those pictures, you didn't mean to send
Lilah took you to her doc, but you don't look like her Left the operating table, still look like "nah"

[Hook:]
I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that chick up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, yeah, and lift that chick up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, never been no fraud
Why do dudes that are not involved love to get involved?
Why do dudes claim the streets and act just like the law?
Riddles that I cannot seem to solve, man
Cristal, come at me, Charlie Brown and Stubs
All come and spoke about your stuff in '15
Man, I know you dudes saw this one comin'
My net worth sound like *grrrrrr*
But they don't pay in cash
Dudes see me like, "What up, Killa?"
Man, please stop bringin' up my past
I'd really love to leave that behind
Sometimes I ask God, "Man, why him?"
Like the team that I would never leave behind
I really gotta ease off the wine
Which is funny because I just saw BL the other day
And she keeps getting faker over time
I just know

[Hook:]
I don't need no, frauds
I don't need no, drama when you call
I don't need no, lies
Pick a side, pick a side
I took the price, and lift that chick up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up
I took the price, yeah, and lift that chick up
I took the ice, let me lift my wrist up

[Verse 3:]
Uh, I am not a fraud, DC, I'm the god
They don't make 'em like me no more, man, I'm a dinosaur
Blunt be tight as biker shorts, twisted like some handlebars
Lil' Tune out a cartoon or Avatar
I just looked in the mirror like, "Alright, alright, alright"
I would let that little dude right there (wooh) my wife, word
I don't need no fake ones in and out my life, word
In and out my pockets and then in and out of sight, word
I don't need no drama, I just need some nana
Just told my lil' mama, "Babe, I think I love you, kinda"
Feelin' like Tune-y Montana
Charlie, he get honored
Stubs a headliner
And Aaron, he still fire , word

[Intro]
Designer bitch, yeah, hope you know you signin'
Night and day, fuck about what time it is
This won't get you high, don't ask me why I'm tryin' it
Designer bitch, she just want the finer things
And day, every day, give a fuck about what time it is
This won't get you high so don't you ask me why I'm tryin' it
Designer bitch
Night and day, every day, give a fuck about what time it is
This won't get you high so don't you ask me why I'm tryin' it

[Chorus]
How you know?
How you know, how you know, how you know? How? How?
How you know?
How you know, how you know, how you know?
How you know?
Tell it to me straight, tell it to me straight, tell it to me straight
Tell it to me straight, or am I too much of a stranger? Stranger
My momma said, "Don't talk to strangers", like me
Baby I'm a stranger, stranger, stranger to you
Baby I'm a stranger, stranger, stranger to you

[Post-Chorus]
Don't you be ashamed, show your face if you feel a way
You know it's earlier when we sleep today
Don't you be ashamed, show your face if you feel a way
You know it's earlier when we sleep today
Took it to the left, we don't slow at all
Wicked, wicked rush, we don't stop at all
Took it to the left, we don't slow at all
Wicked, wicked rush, we don't stop at all

[Verse 1]
We ain't surprised, we doing fine, we-, we doing fine
Have you lost your mind? Oh, we doing fine, we-, we doing fine
I expected all of this from one of these niggas all around me
Only we live forever, so don't you ever time me
I expected this from all the niggas all around me
Only we live forever, so don't you think 'bout timin' me

[Chorus]
How you know?
How you know, how you know, how you know? How? How?

Hey, well that's exactly what a nigga came for
Huh, you throwing shots from afar

Huh, but don't I make it look easy?

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Now you drank up all my liquor, come on

Let me get down
You might not never come down
Now let me come down
You might not never come down
Let me get down

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
You might never, ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Hey, that’s exactly what lil’ mama paid for, huh
You need to put that out if it really ain’t cash though

Hey, now you smoked up all my weed, come on, what I s'posed to do now?
Lil' baby got way too much ass, come on, you gon' have to back it up

You might not ever come down

Let me get down
You might not never come down

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
You might never, ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
(Yo, ayy, uh)
Uh, as I put this Makaveli in my style
It's ATL-ien, my crib is Mediterranean
Girl, rub that pussy, Instagram me
Put my hammy in them panties, goin' hammy in the Lammy, skrrt
Uh, what’s the topic of discussion?
I be flyin' to the nookie in my hoodie, hit the pussy (icky, icky, icky)
Seven figures like your digits, we can travel off your pivot
Drive Mercedes from your Civic, see me ballin' bitches
You drank up all my liquor, come on, now what I'm 'posed to do now?
Two-oh-one-seven now, bitches, come on, now you gon' have to back it up
I said 3 grams cup, hit it now, sugar, come on, ayy, you might never come down

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
You might not ever come down

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
You might never, ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile
You might never, ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile

[Verse 1]
Mind over matter
Does it matter to any of us?
Don't change the subject
I'm heavy on your love
I missed that train, New York city, it rains
Fly to East L.A. in big jet planes
(You know you're on my mind)

[Chorus]
And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall

[Verse 2]
Mind over matter
I'm in tatters thinkin' 'bout her
Taste my disaster (My disaster)
It's heavy on my tongue
All the lights aglow, Tokyo snows
Go to watch the show, curtain's closed
(I'm watching you this time)

[Chorus]
And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall

[Bridge]
I missed that train, New York City it rains
Fly to East L.A. in big jet planes
You know you're on my mind
All the lights aglow, Tokyo snows
Go to watch the show, curtain's closed
(Mind over matter)
You know you're on my mind

[Chorus]
And if the world don't break
I'll be shakin' it
'Cause I'm a young man after all
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall
And if the world don't break

[Outro]
And when the seasons change
Will you stand by me?
'Cause I'm a young man built to fall

[Intro]
What you need? What you need?
What you need, man? What you need?
What you need? Yeah, what'd you see?
What'd you see? Yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Well, I need a little something to cool my head off
Need a little something to cool my head off, yeah
Need a little something because I've been running from a truce
We'll never lose
Lies come from loose teeth tied to the noose
Climbing up my own tree hoping it can hold
All the things I've seen but have chosen to ignore, mmm
Well, I said, well, I believe I've been well fed, yeah
But the wolf's not dead

[Chorus]
Say what you love, it's alright
Don't be afraid to find your light
Embrace the day like night
We're here to fight, we all go wild again
And you have the name of someone I love
You said, just keep it true, lift up your name
Seasons change, you know it'll never be the same
We'll see the sun again
And before it fades
I just wanna say that I love you, mmm

[Verse 2]
Pay the man, pay the man
Got to pay the man, run as fast as you can
Call out to God, praise to the Most High
Call out for help 'cause I'm playing with fire
Call out on mountains till my voice goes faint
Echoes through time then comes back with new strength

[Interlude]
And when it's raining, we're sailing
Oh yeah, we're sailing, we're sailing

[Verse 3]
I'm off the leash, I go to war for peace
'Cause I've been touching everything that I can
I got blood on my hands
Guess I'm going deaf from what the crowd is sayin'
Ah, please forgive me, I don't understand
We all believe we've been well fed, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The deaf man heard what the mute man said
Then they all followed where the blind man led

[Chorus]
Say what you love, it's alright
Don't be afraid to find your light
Embrace the day like night
We're here to fight, we all go wild again
And you have the name of someone I love
You said, just keep it true, lift up your name
Seasons change, you know it'll never be the same
We'll see the sun again
And before it fades
I just wanna say that I love you, mmm

[Bridge]
(Pay the man, pay the man, pay the man)
Pay the man, you got to pay the man
Pay the man, you got to pay the man, pay the man
Well, I was laughing real hard until my teeth fell out
Laughing real hard until my teeth fell out
I was laughing real hard until my teeth fell out
Need a little something, yeah, need a little something
(Little something, little something, little something)
(Little something, little something, little something, little)

[Chorus]
You said, just keep it true, lift up your name
Seasons change, you know it'll never be the same
We'll see the sun again
And before it fades
I just wanna say that I love you, mmm

[Outro]
Can't you see? Can't see me
Can't see me, can't see me
Yeah, can't see me, can't see me
We all run when the light comes on
Am I wrong for wanting it all?
But I warned you, mmm

[Chorus 1]
Just close your eyes, we're gonna run this blind
We live our lives, yeah, we're not wasting time
Maybe we lost our minds
We're gonna get, gonna get, get what we can
But we're not doing it for the money, doing it for the money
Doing it for the money, doing it for the money

[Verse 1]
Is it wrong to write the rules?
We gotta strike a match and light the fuse
And now I'm never looking back
It's time to leave the future in the past

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I said it doesn't matter where I go, I am
Calling all the poets into battle, I am
Shouting to the world, let 'em know that we won't
Be afraid to step into the fight when we can't see the light

[Chorus]
So close your eyes, we're gonna run this blind
We live our lives, yeah, we're not wasting time
Maybe we lost our minds
We're gonna get, gonna get, get what we can
But we're not doing it for the money, doing it for the money
Doing it for the money, doing it for the money

[Verse 2]
Well, if you're down, then soldier up
You better learn to shoot or learn to duck
There's no retreat and no escape
If we keep dreaming while we're wide awake

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I said it doesn't matter where I go, I am
Calling all the prophets into battle, I am
Never gonna change who I am, I won't
Bend under the pressure when my back's on the ropes
I said, it doesn't matter where I go, I am
Staring down the barrel of a gun, we are
Shouting to the world, let them know that we are
Not afraid to step into the fight when you can't see the light

[Chorus]
So close your eyes, we're gonna run this blind
We live our lives, yeah, we're not wasting time
Maybe we lost our minds
We're gonna get, gonna get, get what we can
But we're not doing it for the money, doing it for the money
Doing it for the money, doing it for the money

[Bridge]
Well, it's a silicon rush
And I'm addicted
I don't understand
When it starts, I can't switch
Saying what I won't do
Well, pleasure comes as pain too
But mostly it's an afterthought
And it's slowly coming after you

[Chorus]
So close your eyes, we're gonna run this blind
We live our lives, yeah, we're not wasting time
Maybe we lost our minds
We're gonna get, gonna get, get what we can
But we're not doing it for the money, doing it for the money
Doing it for the money, doing it for the money

[Verse 1]
(Omnipotent, omnipotent)
You are a secret that's worth keeping
And now I'm keeping my mouth shut
On the weekends
I won't hang out with anybody else
The pavement, always begging
What's it want from me?
And I keep falling backwards, looking for relief
Oh, to be free

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Well, I've been counting all the minutes
And the days have been counting me

[Chorus]
I want to live my life again
But you won't
I'll never understand the winds
But you do
I didn't know I was afraid
But you did
I want to do it again

[Verse 2]
Well, I've been sleeping
Waiting for something
But to feel nothing
At all, and avoid the call
Sometimes I'm reckless
Sometimes misdirected
And sometimes when I'm tested
I tend to do nothing at all

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When I'm alone
There's a ghost that keeps talking
And I know there's gotta be more
For sure

[Chorus]
I want to live my life again
But you won't
I'll never understand the winds
But you do
I didn't know I was afraid
But you did
I want to do it again

[Bridge]
(Omnipotent, omnipotent)
Yeah, mmm
I've been numbing my thoughts for hours
Well, I know you wanted to save me from myself
We've been wilting our young for seed
And I can't compete
We're too strong to feel
What's real

[Chorus]
I want to live my life again
But you won't
I'll never understand the winds
But you do
I didn't know I was afraid
But you did
I want to do it again

[Outro]
Yeah, do you want to live forever?
Mmm, ah, mmm

[Verse 1]
I can never be like you, I don't ever talk like that
You smile with a sparkler drink and stumble in your lipstick mess
Well, Hollywood philosophies, yeah, it's a tragedy
But you keep hanging on with a vacant look
Just waiting around for someone to take you home

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I know you know I'm not the one
I'm sorry I was late, I didn't wanna come

[Chorus 1]
(Ah)
Oh no, man, it's just not that much fun
(Ooh)

[Verse 2]
Well, my eyes are wandering, can we just eat the news?
And dance around the room in our scattered point of views
Take my hand and breathe, yeah, just count to three
I wish that I could blink and turn all your words
Into ice cubes so I could fill my drink

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know you know I'm not the one
I'm sorry I was late, next time I just won't come

[Chorus 2]
Woo (Ah)
Oh man, well, I think I gotta run
(Ooh)

[Bridge]
Well, hey, what's that called
When you're sitting on your couch
And having fun just being by yourself?
Wondering why we can't commit to love
The things that we got we always want more of

[Pre-Chorus 3]
I know you'd rather have me fake it, but I'm not gonna make it

[Chorus 3]
Woo (Ah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now I gotta run
(Ooh) Woo

[Verse 1]
I saw you in a dream
You had stayed the same
You were beckoning me
Said that I had changed
Tried to keep my eyes closed
I want you so bad
Then I awoke and it was so sad

[Pre-Chorus]
Haven't talked to you in months
And I thought that I might cry
But I'm not that kind of guy

[Verse 2]
I saw you in a dream
You came to me
You were the sweetest apparition, such a pretty vision
There was no reason, no explanation
The perfect hallucination

[Pre-Chorus]
All good things come to an end
But I thought that this might last
But you came and left so fast

[Chorus]
And when I'm awake I can't switch off
It isn't the same but it is enough
(It isn't the same but it is enough)

[Verse 3]
I saw you in a dream
Then it came to an end
I wonder if you'll come and visit me again
You're taking your time to reappear
I'm starting to believe that when I call your name

[Pre-Chorus]
You just don't hear me anymore
And I know that I shouldn't even try
It's a waste of time

[Chorus]
And when I'm awake I can't switch off
It isn't the same but it is enough
(It isn't the same but it is enough)
And when I'm awake I can't switch off
It isn't the same but it is enough
It isn't the same but it is enough

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Luda!
Yeah
I'mma light this fireplace, you light some candles
If it get too hot, how much you think you can handle?
Make you melt like ice cream
Quiet as kept
If I take my hand up off your mouth, you might scream
Well I say let it out, holla like you Jane in the jungle
And let me climb that tower
Pulling on your hair like Rapunzel
Every now and then you like it rough
Sometimes you like it gentle
I just wanna make love all night
While we listen to the sounds of this instrumental
Treatin' your body like a cello, booty like hello
Jiggle like Jell-O
Love it whenever you get ghetto
When I leave your body smokin' like a cigarillo
This here for grown folk, let's do it all night
And let Bruno sing to you like

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Bruno Mars]
Tell me why your panties still on, girl
When Ginuwine's playing in the background
I will never make a promise that I can't keep
I'm tryna tell it to you gently
We gon' do more than kick it like Jet Li
But you gon' cum before I do, don't stress me
Asking is it you? (is it you?) Is it me? (is it me?)
Say it's us (say it's us) and I'll agree, babe

[Pre-Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Bruno Mars]
Just jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
That's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
That's what I, that's what I
Sex by the fire at night (Sex by the fire)
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

[Bridge: Bruno Mars, PARTYNEXTDOOR & Gucci Mane]
If you say you want a good time
Well here I am baby, here I am baby
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind (What's on your mind)
If you want it, girl come and get it
All this is here for you
Tell me baby, tell me, tell me baby
Huh, Gucci, Bruno, Guwop
What you tryna do

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Bruno, let's go
It's Gucci Mane and Bruno
That's one dynamic duo
A lot of women want me
But I'm in love with you though
Your ex is unimportant
That boy can't even afford it
I drive so many foreigns
Baby I should be deported
Babe, I like the way you touch me
But love the way you f... me
Girl, ain't no need for frontin'
'Cause you're my type of woman
Wanna fly you out the country
To show you how I'm stuntin' (ya)
'Cause you got what I'm wanting
And I got all this money (It's Gucci)

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

[Intro]
You know I woke up this morning
Wave on a hunnid and climbin'
Like yeah, Yoncé
Haha, yeah baby
They shouldn't let me on things like this
Haha, yeah

[Verse 1]
What up, Khaled? I'm up wildin'
Gettin' money, fuck it up on a island
I've been wildin' tellin' bitches to climb in the coupe
Roof transclu-sick swine to the flu shit
Niggas can't fuck up my vibe
Niggas can't fuck up my high
Fuck up my pie and the trap niggas die in the trap
I'm the plug and there'll never be a "plies" in my trap
Nope, nope
Niggas ain't running off on Fargo
Gotta couple bitches coming off cargo
Niggas all involved, the fuck is a Volvo?
Nigga you a con, the fuck out my convo
Dippin' in a V - L.E.T Clone
Tell a hater we ain't speakin' like three dead phones
And my shooter like Viet Jones
He will put them thangs on your head
Like Beat headphones
I'm hot whippin' with the full clip
I'm Scott Pippen to the bullshit
I'm not tripping on you fuck boys
I'm getting chips with the full dip, you dig?
I don't think that my girl's for me
Fly ass nigga make a fly girl corny
Sky girl stormy and a shy girl horny
Take some of yours, when my girls bore me
Five girls for me, all after this show
All after the doh, paul packin' a four
A pretty brown skinned lil broad stackin' the dough
And I pack it on me 'cause I'm attacking' the foes
You dig?
Bitch, I am that nigga
Fuck your man, I blam that nigga
Peanut butter soft, I jam that nigga
Like, oh you think you fly? I land that nigga
I'm the wildest, call me the pilot
Niggas diss me and bullets just start flying
First class ticket to niggas gettin' the stitches
Seat back preference, let the nigga rest quick
One Umbrella Mob to the world
Ain't a better squad to ya, wait, uh
Ain't another squad to your girl
Fake ass nigga, you a fraud to the world
Can't flaw when you thorough, you dig?
I suggest you learn
Old money just sit like a fresh new perm
I just had a threesome out in S.U.Vern
Let the white girlfriend take the next two turns
Mhm, Tell a bitch be honest
Go out to the club, every bitch be on us
Like, you know that I'm rich, be honest
And you know that I'm rich beyond this
You dig, nigga?

[Outro]
Yeah, you know I did this whole verse
With a blunt in my hand?
It stayed lit the whole take
That should let you know something
Oh yeah, we fucking up the whole summer baby
The whole summer is fucking ours
Nobody elses
You could tell all them halfway—
Them halfway throwing jab ass niggas, it's a dub
You dig?
Talk to me nice, or don't talk to me twice
It's Fargo

[Verse 1]
I think I have lost so much time
Over the course of calling you mine
You say it's fine
But she won't go away

[Verse 2]
So maybe next year
Things will go just as I planned
Maybe, who knows, she could be down
But she won't go away

[Chorus]
It's you, hiding in limelight
It's you, no one really likes
It's you, happy all the time
It's you

[Verse 3]
How do I forget that she's around?
Is there a trick?
Middle ground, be okay with it
'Cause she won't go away

[Chorus]
It's you, hiding in limelight
It's you, no one really likes
It's you, happy all the time
It's you

[Chorus]
It's you, hiding in limelight
It's you, no one really likes
It's you, happy all the time
It's you
(Verse)

Gone for the weekend
Time for play
So much we’ve learned while riding this fast train
But when bags are packed up, we haven’t sacked, but I will be back real soon

Monday’s a drag but Friday’s near
And oh how I’ve yearned for just one more time dear
‘Cause once we are dancing, heat waves enhancing
Going home alone won’t do


(Hook)

Roll, roll, roll Celia
She was just home on vacation
She was just home on vacation
She was just home and I’m patient…

Roll, roll, roll Celia
She was just home on vacation
She was just home on vacation
She was just home on vacay-cay-cay-cay (echo out)…
And that’s OK with me, youknownamsayin?
And that’s OK with me

She was just home on vacation
She was just home on vacation. (Yeah)
She was just home on vacation
She was just home on vacation

Ah yeah
OoOoOoOoh, oh
OooooOOOOoooh
Oh yeah
Ah yeah (x2)


(Bridge)

And it feels so good
To know
You were with me, back at home
I said it feels so good
To know
She was with me, right back home, yeah
I wanna go back home, yeah, with you, and me
How we used to do
Ayy
Ah yeah

(Shout out to DJ Zo)


(Verse)

Look, look, look…
I kick flows for ya
Rip down shows for ya
Hit the strip and do gigs on the road for ya
Lord knows I’ll walk a tight rope for ya
Do the crime, then I’ll lie under oath for ya
Do my time on the grind in the cold for ya
Do or die ‘til I lie in a hole for ya
We stay sealed like a kiss to a rose for ya
No amount of bills could appeal what I owe to ya
No frills, no evidence of hoes in ya
Just a rich history of black gold in ya
Nineteen fifties rock and roll in ya
Sixties…threw the soul in ya
Nineteen seventies, Black Power, Huey B, JB and…ahh…
They put the ‘fro on ya
Eighties, well, that really took a toll on ya
The nineties, well, that’s when we lost control of ya
In the era where the money started moldin’ ya
Nowadays everybody think they roll wicha
Nobody paid ‘til the day they get sold on ya
Nobody pay, everybody download on ya
‘Cause when it’s good, everybody wanna grow on ya
But when it’s hood, keep it on the down low on ya
‘Cause when it’s real, everybody got they nose in ya
And I’m just happy I can vibe out and float wicha
Pick a pocket, locked in a loc’ wicha
Stick a socket, throw around notes wicha
Pick a topic, no tellin’ where I go wicha
But when I leave, no that my seed grow wicha
I never leave
I’m diggin on you
You diggin on me
We diggin on we…
And the whole picture
And the whole picture
Yeah, 1, 2, Breezy Lovejoy
Rest in peace B.I.G

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon app, bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon app, bon appétit, baby

[Verse 1]
Looks like you've been starving
You've got those hungry eyes
You could use some sugar
'Cause your levels ain't right
I'm a five-star Michelin
A Kobe flown in
You want what I'm cooking, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me take you
Under candle light
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon app, bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon app, bon appétit, baby

[Verse 2]
So you want some more
Well I'm open 24
Wanna keep you satisfied
Customer's always right
Hope you've got some room
For the world's best cherry pie
Gonna hit that sweet tooth, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me take you
Under candle light
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu
Go ahead

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon app, bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon app, bon appétit, baby
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon app, bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon app, bon appétit, baby

[Bridge]
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Woo!
Ah ah, go ahead
Under candle light (under candle light)
We can wine and dine (we can wine and dine)
Please just take your time
Eat with your hands fine
I'm on the menu
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Go ahead

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet

Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon app, bon appétit, baby

[Outro]
Woop!
Oh, yeah, yeah
Bon app, bon appétit, baby
Woop!

[Verse 1]
Like one of those fireflies
Oh, it looks so good till it's in your hand
It's like one of those memories
Where you can't let go but you just can't stand
It's like one of those crazy dreams
And the permanent screens in the magazines
Saying, "Why'd I love?
All it does is break your heart"

[Chorus]
One morning does it all add up?
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?
You're getting close to giving up
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie, live or die
I, well, I guess that's life

[Verse 2]
Like one of those people
With the beautiful eyes and the perfect face
It's like one of those stories
Where the hero dies in the very last race
Like one of those endless cries
And the crazy lies of a hurting child
Saying, "Why did love have to hurt?
It broke my heart"

[Chorus]
One morning does it all add up?
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?
You're getting close to giving up
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie, live or die
I, well, I guess that's life

[Bridge]
I always liked to think
That I was always brave enough
To try to master any push and shove
Well I guess I never qualified love

[Chorus]
One morning does it all add up?
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?
You're getting close to giving up
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie, live or die
I, well, I guess that's life

Oh, I guess that's life
Well, I guess that's life

But she's looking at you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Days like this, I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
'Cause you chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drain me down
That was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Verse 2]
I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Bridge]
Now look at me, I’m sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won’t never put me out again
I’m glowing, oh whoa
You can keep the dog for me
I never liked him anyway
In fact you can keep everything
Yeah, yeah, except for me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no

[Verse 1]
Someone found a letter you wrote me, on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name
But I knew just who they meant

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I was so surprised and shocked
And I Wondered too
If by change you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling about you
But they said it really loud
They said it on the air

[Hook]
On the radio, whoa oh-oh
On the radio, whoa oh-oh
On the radio, whoa oh-oh
On the radio whoa oh oh now, now
Now, now

[Verse 2]
Don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song?
Things are not the same since we broke up last June
The only thing that I wanna hear is that you love me still
And that you think you'll be comin' home real soon
Whoa, oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Yeah, and it made me feel proud when I heard you say
You couldn't find the words to say yourself
And now in my heart, I know I can say what I really feel
'Cause they said it really loud, they said it on the air

[Hook]
On the radio, whoa oh-oh
On the radio, whoa oh-oh
On the radio, whoa oh-oh

If you think that love isn't found on the radio
Then tune right in, you might find the love you lost
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago
'Cause he said it really loud, he said it on the air

[Hook]
On the radio, whoa oh-oh

Probably in the hot tub with my girls soaking watching vh1 tripping or adult swim
Them niggas kinda cool but they can't flow with him
After we done I smoke one then we go again  

[laugh]
I'm tall slim and I know how to stack my bread
Instead of running you be throwing it back instead
I run game I don't know how to slack
You get money and don't know how to act
That's young nigga shit
I smoke strong cuz it help me relax
And the crib get controlled by an app
I pull up with the stick
Hit the switch hop out to get a bitch
Tell her I ain't really nothing like the nigga she with
She convinced so she hop up in my 6-4 then we dip
Got papers got grinders so we lit
Ima pull up with a zip

My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "Cause He made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up, girl and you you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"

I'm beautiful in my way
Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way
Ooh, there ain't another way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Whether you're broke or evergreen
You're black, white, beige, chola descent
You're Lebanese, you're orient
Whether life's disabilities
Left you outcast, bullied or teased
Rejoice and love yourself today
Cause baby, you were born this way

No matter gay, straight or bi
Lesbian, transgendered life
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to survive
No matter black, white or beige
Chola or orient made
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to be brave!

Hello, hello, baby
You called, I can't hear a thing
I have got no service
In the club, you say, say?
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh?
You're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy
K-kind of busy, k-kind of busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy

Just a second
It's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with
A drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me
You knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me
I'm kind of busy

Stop calling, stop calling
I don't want to think anymore!
I've got my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling
I don't want to talk anymore!
I've got my head and my heart on the dance floor

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephoning me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
I'm busy!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephoning me!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

Can call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Cause I'm out in the club, and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

I've had a little bit too much, much
All of the people start to rush (start to rush by)
A dizzy twister dance
Can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys? I lost my phone, phone
What's going on on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I can't remember, but it's alright, alright

Just dance, gonna be okay
Da-da-doo-da
Just dance, spin that record, babe
Da-doo-doo-doo
Just dance, gonna be okay
Duh-duh-duh
Dance, dance, dance, just j-j-just dance

How you doing tonight, Texas?
America...World...how you doing tonight?
We're here to make you feel good. You wanna feel good with us?

You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay

Hey Dad, Hey Mom.

Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons

I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one...tell me that you'll be the good one... why don't you...stay, stay, stay?

Super Bowl 51!
As I left my home waiting for magic to save us
This party rolled over your plan to this
Well now I know, now I know that I stand
There forever waking to find our way back home again

We found that fish are quite lucky
My friend's opinion oh
If he believes that I
Came to see
Digging away I notice that once
Dare I find you the secret to what we call
Mystery

The places we roam
The powers we hold
I long to unfold

[Intro]
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time when we fell in love?
'Cause I remember the night when you had enough of my creeping, oh
You packed up your bags and said you were leaving
You found a new man and said we were even now
Even now
It's funny how everything seems to even out
Even now

[Verse 1]
I wish you could put it behind you
Wish you would put up your blinders
Wish you would stop listening to you friends
And come to where no one would find us
Wish you would just keep your focus on me
So I can give you a reminder
That I can be who I'm supposed to
I can do better, I know you remember

[Pre-Chorus]
Every single night, we were living life in love
Every single time, I was doing right, enough
To keep you around, now look at where I end up
Look where I end up

[Chorus]
Remember the time when we fell in love?
'Cause I remember the night I know you had enough of my creeping, oh
Baby, it was only for a season, maybe

[Verse 2]
And it ain't really had nothing to do with you, it was all really me (no, yeah)
'Cause I was tryna see the world like a dog on a leash (world, leash)
And you was tryna hold me back
I ain't wanna let you go ahead of me (yeah)
I let you go and I knew I should have never let you go ahead of it

[Pre-Chorus]
You remember every single night, we were living life in love
Every single time, I was doing right, enough
To keep you around, now look at where I end up
Look where I end up

[Chorus]
Remember the time when we fell in love?
'Cause I remember the night, I know you had enough of my creeping
Baby, it was only for a season, maybe

[Bridge]
Keep going round, round in circles (keep going round, round in circles)
Hoping you understand my circumstance (hoping you understand my circumstance)
Lord knows I never meant to hurt you (Lord knows I never meant to hurt you)
Is it because I'm a dog now?
Wish I knew then what I know now
I'm not the same when I go out
I just keep it on the low now
Is it because I'm a dog now?
I'm not the same when I go out
Wish I knew then what I know now
I just keep it on the low now

[Chorus]
Don't you remember the time when we fell in love?
'Cause I remember the night, I know you had enough of my creeping
Baby, it was only for a season, maybe

[Outro]
Keep going round, round in circles
Round in circles
Keep, keep, keep going round, round in circles
Round in circles

[Chorus]
I know this hoe
But if the shoe fits your gonna have to wear it
So you can't be mad for me talkin' bout

[Verse 1]
A hoe gon' be a hoe I gotta let you know
Cause I got plenty hoes and these hoes come and go

You was s'posed to be there when I got out of jail
But you'd rather hoe out with all of your friends
Going crazy, did my time, you ain't send me mail
Takin' L's when I was tryna make you win, ain't had no bail
You supposed to be down for your nigga
Baby, where you at? Baby, who you with? Girl, you slippin'
I was supposed to have your heart
But you just kept me in the dark, by painting pictures
I know you lying and you sneaking, I'm just stating facts
I'm just that dummy who believed you 'cause I loved your ass
Not the only nigga who been through that
But I'm the only nigga with receipts and popping tags

[Pre-Chorus]
I was looking forward to us makin' love
And wakin' up for round two
But you ain't stayed long enough, and it's fuckin' me up
Learning from them hoes that's around you

[Chorus]
And now you up on games, no
You don't see me the same, no
The drugs, they can numb the pain
Poppin' bars, the easy part, but I still hurt the same

[Verse 2]
Thinkin' 'bout these bitches when I'm rollin' up
I'm just tryna vibe, wanna feel the love, two bitches like double dutch
Off that purple Actavis, I stay with that double cup
I just switched my style up, now she stuck like what the fuck
Started not to care, European real, bought a couple foreigns
Drivin' outta here, know that molly get me there
Just a couple sips, just so I forget, don't remember shit
Get a lot of pussy, don't fuck with relationships
I'm out my mind, on that crazy shit
On my brazy shit, don't wanna know who she be fucking with
She tryna break my heart, I know you lovin' it
You on some other shit and I'm on my own again

[Pre-Chorus]
I was looking forward to us makin' love
And wakin' up for round two
But you ain't stayed long enough, and it's fuckin' me up
Learning from them hoes that's around you

[Chorus]
And now you up on games, no
You don't see me the same, no
The drugs, they can numb the pain
Poppin' bars, the easy part, but I still hurt the same

[Verse 3]
Think of ways to navigate
Why you steady throwin' shade on my name?
While I'm taking all the blame
We both messed up and goin' separate ways
You fuckin' them niggas, I'm fuckin' them bitches
All that silly shit won't make a difference
Know what it is, I'm the man in my city
He only look at your ass and your titties
You don't need makeup, you know that you pretty
You kinda crazy, you know that I get it
Half on a baby, you know that I did it
Guilty as charged, I ain't gonna be innocent
I'm tryna be limitless
I'm tryna fuck up all the Hennessy
You know I say "fuck all my enemies"
I know you on your independent shit
Quality over quantity
Bad bitch right in front of me
Can't lie, baby, honestly
'Cause that pussy remindin' me

[Chorus]
And now you up on games, no
You don't see me the same, no
The drugs, they can numb the pain
Poppin' bars, the easy part, but I still hurt the same

Numb the pain, yeah
Poppin' bars, easy part, still hurt the same

That last hour was the worst
When we remember forever
Blessing and a curse
If we could fall back one more hour

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we could've made it work
Maybe we should've focused on each other first
Could've left off on better terms
If we could fall back for more hours

[Chorus]
Daylight savings
Like daylight savings
If we could revisit that moment again
I would never let us end that way
Like daylight savings
Like daylight savings
If we could revisit that moment again
I would never let us end that way

Maybe we should've focused on each other first
Could've left off on better terms
If we could fall back for more hours

I would never let us end that way
Like daylight savings
Like daylight savings
If we could fall back one more hour

Maybe we could've made it work
Maybe we should've focused on each other first
Could've left off on better terms
If we could fall back one more hour

And it don't make no difference, it don't make no difference (no, no)
Shawty, got exiled, exiled
Can't believe you got me stressed out, stressed out right now (stressed, oh)

Baby, why you playing with emotions? (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I searched through the crowd, tryna keep up with you (crowd)
Top five, top down, you won't find another nigga (down)
Testing all my patience, I've had it up to here (oh, here)
I don't know who's making you cum when I'm not there

[Intro]
Oh, ooh, baby

Oh, baby, pick out your favorite wine

I'm ready to tear it up
So baby, let me inside
And just look me in my eyes, oh woah, oh woah
Girl, I don't give a damn, ain't no other man taking my place
He can't hit your spot like I can, making your legs shake, oh
Licking your lips, girl, I love the way you taste
Yeah, you know I love that kinky shit

I'm tryna lay you on your stomach on that freaky shit
Be submissive, let me dive in
Yeah, she think I'm freaking on her, I'ma rub it in

It's too good, I'm trying not to bust a nut
Too fast, I'm tryna last

[Chorus]
I can't even lie, lie, lie
It's too damn good, I can't handle it, babe
But I'ma try to last all night

And just make love to me, only me
Don't give my love away, girl

Baby, don't even get me started, that pussy mine, ooh Lordy, Lordy
Your hands in my pockets, huh
She know I'ma give her anything she ever wanted
Skrrt, skrrt, she driving
Key in her ignition, here's the real difference between bitches and women
Ooh, baby, know I love that
How you take that, how you throw it back
Baby, you know just what you're doing
I ain't stupid, yeah

[Chorus]
I'ma try my best to last all night
Ooh woah, I'ma try to last all night

Giddy up hor-sey, panorama por-sey, I am not remor-sey, I eat a dinner cor-sey
No, he fuckin' with the right bitch, tight grips, softer lips

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]

She called me ten times, need to let that shit ride
If her old man catch her, might not let that bitch slide
I'm leavin' out my hood til' 6, headin' to west side
Vampires outside, they be trappin' all night
Hundred swishers fat as backs, it's a wrap, it's a wrap
I am just another nigga from the trap, with a scrap, on my lap
Just in case, dirty rats, filthy pigs, stupid fuck, you's a vampire
Tell these snitches to suck it
Tryna suck up information, probably work for the force
Dirty rat, filthy pig, I'm not a duck stupid fuck

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]

[Intro]
Dogg, what up, mane?
Word on the streets is you ain't what you used to be

[Verse 1]
I gang bang to the fullest
A lot of niggas talk about it but they really don't do it, do they?
So I'm doin' it for y'all
Mark or a buster, I'ma ruin it for y'all
Stomp that, strap up, mash up
And get it crackin' with the slapper, jacker
Smacker, rapper? Nah nigga, that ain't me
Gangsta? Yeah nigga, can't you see?
Rider, like the tonners on my Chevrolet
West Coast, motherfucker, that's the only way
Yeah homie, what you say?
Home of the Wook, Wok and Gunplay
A lot of homies shoot to J
But most of 'em prefer to shoot the K
Yeah, that's the good life
And where we come from, loc, that's the hood life
Where you mama and daddy
Throw the set up out the moon while they swangin' the caddy
That's on the set, tats on they neck
Streets sweet with the heat, yep, they stay on deck
I'm dazed and blazed, no confusin', I'm choosin'
This how I was raised
I bring that out and bag it up, no doubt
Swang it out and let it up and bang that out
This Crips, nigga

[Interlude]
That's crazy, cuz
You know my whole life, I wanted to be a gangsta, mane
I used to see my OG home boys at King Park
Ridin' on bikes but they came with they flags on the end
C-walkin', Stacey Adams, 501's
That shit was fascinating

[Verse 2]
The Miles Davis of gangbangin' and crack slangin'
Drivin' a fresh rock, rental with blocks in 'em
I'm fresh out the county, I'm boxin' 'em
Moved on up and bought a continental, nigga, with knock in it
Now I'm rockin' it, '61 blockin' it
If y'all ridin' by, my nigga, we cockin' it
We poppin' on imposters, fake ass mobsters
East side niggas, no stoppin' us
My recipe is treachery
The best in me, nigga, the West to be
A better place for the one of Ace
Put a 9 millimeter in your fuckin' face
And let you say your grace before you have a taste
Of reality, set in, yeah, it's your fate
Now your homies at your funeral, plottin' on some get back
But you can't get back 'cause nigga, you dated
Another sad gangsta story
And usually ones with the territory
No nuts, no glory, no pain, no gain
Life for a nigga growin' up in the game
This slangin' thang, drinkin', sell a lil' cocaine
Get locked up for a minute now we in it to win it
Now everybody know me
They watchin' the makings of a real OG

[Interlude]
Yeah, they say if you watch somethin' long enough, you'll become it
You know, they say imitation is the best form of flattery
That's what I was told
A lot of niggas is imitatin' this real gangsta shit
You ain't cut from it
You dig?

[Verse 3]
Yeah, scarin' all the white folk
While stayin' on the right note
And you can quote me if you want to
Don't say what you will do, nigga, what you gon' do?
I'm live in the flesh
Caught him on Imperial left five in his chest
Survive in the west
It's everyday cycle, you never know what might go blam
And how you like me now?
Crip 'til you slip, Mr. Big Bow Wow
Yeah, it's my chance to prance
I got ants in my pants and I needs to dance
I go for broke, no joke
I gotta put my drink down, I'm tryna C walk, loc
See i'ma take off, break off
And make off with the cash
At the pad with, a thick lil bitch, she super bad

[Outro]
Gangsta, gangsta
Futuristic

[Verse 1: Rick Rock]
I wear my heart on my sleeve, but it’s a purple heart (purple heart)
North bay, water mammals, swim with killer sharks (killer sharks)
I’m from the 7-O-7, it’s no heaven (it’s no heaven)
I’m a top five mob, hyphy veteran (hyphy veteran)
Ricky Rock my nigga, I got slaps (got slaps)
You can play him for hours, back to back (back to back)
Listen, niggas on your team that love that money over everything
Can never be loyal, now take that back to the soil
Anywhere on earth, and it’ll work
I’m just sharing my experiences on earth for what it’s worth
Maybe it’s just me tho, ‘cause I don’t trust y’all (trust y’all)
I’m in a lough off some grapes and a BuzzBall, trippin’ like
Look at this shit here (here)
This sucker shit is running rampant, it’s the moment I fear

[Hook: Rick Rock]
It was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Let me talk to 'em, nephew
Ricky is tricky, the game is gettin’ slippery
This shit is a maze, cuz singing like a Tempree
I disappear for one minute ‘til they miss me
Another TV show, more dough, I’m makin’ history
Now I'm back at your service
Wish me luck dear, I’m scared and I'm nervous
You never left you brought that hood back with ya
I'm the real deal, I ain't gon' bullshit with ya
Another one I wanna make, another joint I wanna make
Open the oven put some candles on my cake
Twenty-five and countin’, etch my face into Kushmore Mountain
Can’t be scared of your opponent dog-gone it if you want it, trip this
This sucker shit is running rampant, it’s the moment I fear

[Hook: Rick Rock]
It was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
Yeah, my nigga it was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
My nigga it was the moment I feared
Yeah, my nigga it was the moment I feared

[Intro]
Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fitting

[Chorus]
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks

[Verse 1]
Standin' amazing, hit you in the brain
Get with Snoop Dogg, he can put you in the game
Put you on the stage, maybe even front page
Get a little fortune, have a little fame
Kill 'em with class, toast to the boogie while you fill up your glass
So quick, so fast
No razzmatazz, I'm just an eastside nigga
With my gangster ass, twenties
I used to pinch pennies
Only Gs, I don't fuck with no weenies
My clique is sick, it expandin'
To outlaws, riders and bandits
What you gon' do
When we coming to a hood near you?
You know

[Chorus]
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks

[Verse 2]
What's beef? 'Cause beef is in the kitchen
What you want dog? I'm on a million-dollar mission
How can you get it if you ain't been through shit?
I'm just a seed that was planted by Ruthless
My family tree is so G, we was cut from the cloth called LBC
Crybaby, used to C-Walk at the park
Pitbulls on a leash that would never bark
Real love, real dubs, real 'saniacs
Trip Locc, kinfolk, and Wayniac
Peace to the deceased that passed away
"Duces 'n Trayz: The Old Fashioned Way"
What you gon' do
When we pull up in a hood near you?
You know

[Chorus]
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks

[Outro]
Yeah, certified official gangsta shit
Unfiltered, like a pack of humps, nigga
Detrimental to all and any that disrespect or deviate from the G calls
It's either hog status or buster status
It ain't no in betweens
You can't wake up and put this on, nigga
Every breath you breathe gotta be committed to this shit
Clappin' niggas, tappin' switches, mackin' bitches
Mansion business and stackin riches
It's all a part of that lifestyle we created back in the days for the world to follow
Gs up, forever
The boss dogg an' Tha General, front line and on the east side

[Intro: KRS-One]
Yeah! Lalala lala lala la la la la
Lalala lala lala la la la la
What up Snoop?
KRS in the building
Listen! Listen!

{Verse 1: KRS-One]
Too much brrr brrr brr
Too many people getting brrred 

[?]
All you hear is brrr brrr brr in the streets
People gripping they heat just to settle they beefs
Now you getting chased by police
You running to the west, running to the east
But the problem is you under the beast
Brr brr brr - now your brother's deceased
We need peace, not brrr in the streets
The brrr in Iraq lasts for weeks
Wack rappers, I'm crushing these creeps
Every time I spit they get weak
Knowledge reigns suprrreme
I take you back to the days when the telephone used to rrring
I'm reading the sacred script, KRS, Battlecat, Snoop in it, uh!

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Let us begin - what, where, why or when?
Most of my homeboys are dead or in the pen
While I'm at the top, upfront getting it in
Open doors, fuck that cuh, we kick them in
Blastmaster (One!), blast faster
No more slave mentality, cause now we the masters
Ready for whatever cause you know that they after us
Clear the scene with the beam, cuh, this shit could get disastrous

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
By any means necessary, peeking out the window
Watching all this sucker shit, look at the pretenders
Thinking how the rap game was
I dig, I dug, I push, I shove, yeah I fell out of love
But it ain't no thing, telephone ring
They don't make 'em like they make 'em when I used to bang
So I try to show the little homies different things
How to diversify, and change different lanes
Learn to read a little, exercise your brain
Mental gymnastics, it's a cold game
Always knew that they would try and trip me, trick me but they couldn't
Cause all my teachers and doctors were curious to the furnace
The honorable speaks
Like Minister Louis Farrakhan my influence is deep
Cause it's truth
What's that? You don't like that?
Well we fight back. And we'll be right back

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Let us begin - what, where, why or when?
Most of my homeboys are dead or in the pen
While I'm at the top, upfront getting it in
Open doors, fuck that cuh, we kick them in
Blastmaster (One!), blast faster
No more slave mentality, cause now we the masters
Ready for whatever cause you know that they after us
Clear the scene with the beam, cuh, this shit could get disastrous

[Intro]
Shoot nigga, let me shoot
Oh you ain't throwin' shit, nigga I'm throwing' this , I'm throwin this

Boss nigga, boss shit, I got boss dick
Fresh fast done fucked a coffin

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Old ass nigga in the club full of young hoes
Smoking backwoods with the Migos
Dranking my drank in the glass, no cup in the cut, ducked off gettin' fucked up
Nothin' but family around me
Man these hoes are astounding
She say she went to school with my young son
Fuck around and get popped with the bop gun
Cute lil' bitch
Told me that her daddy was a 8-Trey crip
I did time with the nigga, four months
Cut to the chase lil' bitch, you wanna fuck?
'Cause if you do, this's what's gon' pop
No pictures and no photoshop

Get with the program, jump in the bro-ham (Biatch)

[Chorus: Nef Tha Pharaoh]
She throw it to a nigga, I'ma toss it

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
Ole ass nigga with some young bitches
Sugar daddies talking bout some come get this
Not me, fuck y'all, I tell her young ass she better break me off
You niggas way too soft
She need a player like me you gotta take that loss
I want the money and the honey
Even though I'm a pimp and a player she still wants me
She's in the family now
I got the next nigga waiting on them hand me down
But she'd show up with Snoop, hanging out
See the wet stain on her panties now
Mad as fuck but he ain't saying shit
Cuz we got more bitches than we came here with
Somehow some way gotta save the bit
But you crazy if you thinking we that we ain't gonna hit it (nigga)

[Chorus: Nef Tha Pharaoh]
She throw it to a nigga, I'ma toss it
She throw it to a nigga, I'ma toss it
Boss nigga, boss shit, I got boss dick
Fresh fast done fucked a coffin
She throw it to a nigga, I'ma toss it
She throw it to a nigga, I'ma toss it
Boss nigga, boss shit, I got boss dick
Fresh fast done fucked a coffin

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Whenever I'm down and out I get back to myself
I roll a motherfucking fat bat to myself
Leave it to beaver, America gon' legalize but I ain't believe her
Til she finally did it
Overworked but I'm still committed
All things under the letter G, Snoop Dogg done did it
Gracefully gazing unto the sky
A lot of people smoke just to get by
But I see things much differently
Medically, physically, mentally, theoretically
Put it in a letter so you let it be
One day we'll all agree and have peace up under a big chronic tree
If I had my way at 4:20 every day you could blaze a J
And not have to answer to nobody
I live my life like it's a party
So let's go cuz

[Hook]
So go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)
So go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana (Get high)
Na-na-na-na-na-nananana

[Verse 2: Devin The Dude]
I blaze up soon as I raise up from out of my sleep
I got me a sweet
I hope they legalize it here, I'm tired of police
You think you could smoke like me & Snoop, don't try to compete
I'll still blaze with ya, fire that ho up
If smoking weed is going down, then I'ma show up
Weed is where I'm needed, it's a necessity
If I ain't got it, little shit get the best of me
I even put it in my food, I got a brownie recipe
You eat one piece man your ass'll be fucked up for six or seven hours or so
You don't like edibles? Then I got plenty of flowers to blow
Smoke it in the paper, cigar, a bong
Don't worry about the haters, just vibe to the song
And do it however you please, you please
Today's the day to smoke weed

[Hook]
So go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)
So go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana (Get high)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Damn, a pound ain't really nothing now
Remember smoking with my cousin
Now we all Raw cone stuffing
Enough to wake neighbors up
KK my favorite flavor
And you ain't gotta ask cause we major
I smoke like them old players
Only put it in the paper
I just started recently letting niggas smoke blunts around me
Known to keep the room cloudy
Get a bad bitch, sit her down, let her smoke, now she open
The best trees I be smoking
Smell it through the bag so it's potent
Even get it on the plane, TSA don't even notice
Ran in the burner, he done taught a young nigga how to grow it
A pothead but I be focused
And it ain't in my session if it's bullshit
Only the best what you dealing with
It's legal now, everybody's doing this

[Hook]
So go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)
So go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)

So go ahead and put your J's up
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana na

[Outro]
Come and smoke with me tonight, tonight
There's talk on the street; it sounds so familiar
Great expectations, everybody's watching you
People you meet, they all seem to know you
Even your old friends treat you like you're something new

Johnny come lately, the new kid in town
Everybody loves you, so don't let them down

You look in her eyes; the music begins to play
Hopeless romantics, here we go again
But after a while you're looking the other way
It's those restless hearts that never mend

Johnny come lately, the new kid in town
Will she still love you when you're not around?
There's so many things you should have told her
But night after night you're willing to hold her
Just hold her, tears on your shoulder

There's talk on the street; it's there to remind you
It doesn't really matter which side you're on
You're walking away and they're talking behind you
They will never forget you till somebody new comes along
Where you been lately? There's a new kid in town
Everybody loves him, don't they?
And he's holding her, and you're still around
Oh, my, my
There's a new kid in town, just another new kid in town
Ooh, hoo
Everybody's talking 'bout the new kid in town
Ooh, hoo
Everybody's walking like the new kid in town

There's a new kid in town. I don't want to hear it
There's a new kid in town. I don't want to hear it
There's a new kid in town. There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town. Everybody's talking
There's a new kid in town. People started walking
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town

[Verse 1]
Oh, I feel the ocean in my head
Oh, the pressure's rising and my heart beat's speeding
(For you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you)
And don't you feel the tension crawling up your chest?
Oh, it's do or die, kid
How it's always been
(For you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you, for you)

[Chorus]
Please call me and tell me that you want me
'Cause right now my life is getting pretty ugly
And I wanna share a cigarette and I wanna go dancing in the rain
So call me and tell me that you want me
And let's do it all again

[Verse 2]
Oh, the tropical weather
It must've softened your heart
(Beats for you, beats for you, beats for you, beats for you, beats for you, beats for you, beats for you)
But now we're back on the streets in California where the air is dry
And your heart is closing up in plain sight
(Beats for you, beats for you, beats for you, beats for you, beats for you, beats for you, beats for you)

[Chorus]
Please call me and tell me that you want me
'Cause right now my life is getting pretty ugly
And I wanna share a cigarette and I wanna go dancing in the rain
So call me and tell me that you want me
And let's do it all again

[Bridge]
And I question your love for me
You tell me to have confidence
I question your love for me
'Cause baby, you don't make no sense

[Chorus]
Please call me and tell me that you want me
'Cause right now my life is getting pretty ugly
And I wanna share a cigarette and I wanna go dancing in the rain
So call me and tell me that you want me
And let's do it all again

[Chorus]
Ridin' around with these ballers
Got a white girl that don't charge
She work it up, how poor
Got a baby dad and they in love
Put about 50 pounds of his dope

[Verse]
Heard the damn with his dog
Got some kilos under their arm
With my brig squad and my broads
Kiddy pants in my car
I have money no story
And I've heard this shit and I'm boss
Got a truck hop with no air see
But we're squashed up, no good
To the street life I'm in HD
Nuff said, a nigga so hood
Got a pentagram, no camera
I swear I'm 'bout the hood
Ain't 'bout her, maybe them 2
Maybe cool with these then more
I'm a rich sloppy you sure
The city's there, on tour
Got a little fucker we ball

[Chorus]
Ridin' around with these ballers
Got a white girl that don't charge
She work it up, how poor
Got a baby dad and they in love
Put about 50 pounds of his dope

[Skit]
Yea, we on the air right now.
Know what I'm sayin'?
You didn't think I was official man
Read my T-shirt man
Look what that say right there
My homie's back, okay?
Talkin' Ferrari boys, I'm the third member they haven't exposed out yet
But I am the third member
You know, Ferrari boys so I'm out here to do my camie wall
Got my wardrobe together
Gucci, good to have you back homie
Let's keep you back, know what I mean? Alright
Sway, world famous like you showed up keen and tech
I see you reached nice
Wuddup bitch, I see you Vermont dukes
Shaheen, Lee, Bob Martin and Vic, everybody
Stay away from fire on the BG
We got you back homie
That's why I'm here

[Refrain]
What's harder, life or Mr. Carter?
Balling 'til my hair is as white as Johnny Carson
You don't have to beg because I'm fresh out of pardons
Little voices in my head said, "Don't mind the little voices," woah

[Verse 1]
What's harder, love or Mr. Carter?
Especially when these hoes ain't right, these hoes ain't loyal
Shit, who's wrong? Who's right? Just ask my lawyer
Right or wrong, I'm still gon' take his advice, he take my orders
I'll be a-okay instead of alright, or kinda-sorta
And before I ever take that for granted, I take the charges
See, you can't believe in all of the hype you hear at the barber
If the odds are stacked against us, they're likely to stack 'em on us
Lil Tune, Jurassic in the room, Tyrannosaurus
I ain't steal it, I took it, I ain't crooked, I'm cater-cornered
And if my fruits of labor were ripe, I would have an orchard
But I'm nauseous from my ups-and-downs and back-and-forwards
Shit, Mr. Carter, eyes are always on you
So I smile for the cameras and hide from the reporters
Roll a blunt up in this bitch, when it burn, it start my motor
Shoulder shruggin' in this bitch 'cause the world is on my shoulders, shit
What's harder, life or Mr. Carter?
Tune in this bitch, let's spike the Holy Water
Tryna stay grounded, my flights said no departures
Shit, what's harder, murder or abortion? Woah
What's harder, death or Mr. Carter?
Is it easier to play deaf or to listen harder?
I'm like, "Girl, what's harder than life for Mr. Carter?
Knock on wood, but with the wood comes termites and turmoil"
What's easier, to change diapers or back to normal?
Times are changing like Father Time just lost his father
What's harder, to ask for sorrow or to borrow?
Or to break hearts or get your heart broke? I don't know

[Refrain]
I ask, "What's harder, jail or Mr. Carter?
School or Mr. Carter? The news or Mr. Carter?
Man, what's harder, drugs or Mr. Carter?
Judge or Mr. Carter? Court and order, yeah"

[Verse 2]
What's harder, life or Mr. Carter?
I ride for this shit like a knight in shining armor
I pile up the dope and roll it tight like UnderArmour
Coming from this neighborhood, it's just like coming from comas
I got homies from the old school, and we been lost our diplomas
Got some hoes from California, think they shit smell like begonias
Got a bone to pick? I pick it 'til you're boneless
Like I come from San Antonio, pop up at the spur of the moment, how you want it?
When in Hell, I'm a Roman; head on fire, I'm a comet
Heat up out my abdomen, and you know me
Man, I'm all about my business, business handle business for me
I know you know life's a bitch, turned her to a business woman, mind your business
I'm sayin', "What's harder, life or Mr. Carter?
What's higher, the price or Mr. Carter?
Should I call you Mystery? Because I'm right here to solve you
And if you start to smell fear or fright, I sprayed it on you"
I made it, and when I made it, you hate it, I made it, on you
You know the streets talk, my nigga, don't make 'em argue
Niggas faded away, I light one and get faded for you
I'm reclinin', Weezy Baby, La-Z-Boy you, they enjoy you

[Outro]
I'm like, "What's harder, life or Mr. Carter?"

I shoot a wink and take a drink, yo, yo, yeah
What, you don't want me to party? (What don't you want?)
What, you gon' want me to molly?
You want me stuck in apartment?
Family feud with Steve Harvey
See out the bullet in Charlotte

Get down for the get down
I'm slipping from the rope
Got to let go
A million miles to fall down
I'm swimming through the smoke
I'm high on rope
A million miles to fall

Come and beat me u-u-up
Wanna feel your ru-u-ush
Running through my blo-o-ood
Say you want me, say you want me
Know you will
I'm slipping from the rope
Got to let go
So catch me when I fall down

I'm slipping from the rope
Got to let go
A million miles to fall down
I'm swimming through the smoke
I'm high on rope
A million miles to fall
Come and beat me u-u-up
Wanna feel your ru-u-ush
Running through my blo-o-ood
Say you want me, say you want me
Know you will
I'm slipping from for the rope
Got to let go
So catch me when I fall down

I'm slipping from the rope
Got to let go
A million miles to fall down
I'm swimming through the smoke
I'm high on rope
A million miles to fall

Come and beat me u-u-up
Wanna feel your ru-u-ush
Running through my blo-o-ood
Say you want me, say you want me
Know you will
I'm slipping from the rope
Got to let go
So catch me when I fall down

[Verse 1]
Come on, baby, come on over
Just throw something on
Don't worry about your hair or makeup
Come home, I'm about to set myself on fire
Say yes, let your body do the talking
Say less, I taste you in my mouth, every so often
Baby, I'm strong enough to lift you up high

[Hook]
Pull up, pull up on it
Tell me that you want it
Said pull up, pull up on it
It's so much warmer inside

[Verse 2]
It was a journey to the heart of you
But I'm glad I finally found it, yeah
And baby we got to go through it
Because ain't no way around it
Then she cuts me off with a kiss
Love's got nothing to do with this
Just the heat of the moment
Reminds you of something I should miss
Ooh, there's not much to explain, no
This big nigga just off the chain, woah
Why every women I invested in
I make sure she gets the best of him
You'll never hear her complain, so

[Hook]
Pull up
Pull up on it
Tell me
That you want it
Said pull up
Pull up on it
It's so much warmer inside

[Chorus: Wurld]
I know, I know, I know
You have been waitin'
I know, I know, I know
I know what you've been waiting for
You think I'll make you a break-up song
Do you really think you deserve it?
And I know you've been longin' for it
You think I'll make you a break-up...

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I know how you want this to go
I know how you want me to flow
You want me to even the score
You want me to upload a post
You want me to go back and forth 'bout that shit I did with that random lil' hoe
You want me to, hmm, but that'd be doin' the most
They wanna see a nigga deep in his feelings 'cause that's where they usually go
New bitches always got somewhere to go but that's what the Uber is for
Old bitches always be down for a setup but that's what my shooters is for
Bitches be so quick to side with a bitch like they never heard rumors before
I hate emotions, I ain't good with 'em
I only fuck with trouble, put that wood in 'em
I ain't good for 'em, ain't no sugarcoatin' shit, ain't no shoulda, coulda, would in 'em
From the hood but not a hoodlum
Lyin' gossip with they sis and them
Bitches fall for anything you tell 'em, better get the pillow for some cushionin'
Light the kush again

[Chorus: Wurld]
I know, I know, I know
You have been waitin'
I know, I know, I know
I know what you've been waiting for
You think I'll make you a break-up song
Do you really think you deserve it?
And I know you've been longin' for it
You think I'll make you a break-up...
I know, I know, you know
I know, you know, you don't-you don't deserve it
I know, I know, you know
And you know it
And you know it

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
This ain't a love song or a fight and break-up and make-up song
This ain't a grudge song, this a "who can you trust" song, yeah
A "water ain't thicker than blood" song
This ain't a club song, "Fontainebleau Miami revolt" song
This a "only God can judge" song
"People care too much 'bout who I fuck" song
We used to smoke and then discuss songs
"Now some things shouldn't be discussed" songs
This a "hush, you blowin' my buzz" song
"Power usually corrupt" song, yeah
"Too stubborn to ever budge" song
This a "now you look at me in disgust" song
"Control yourself, take what you need but I indulge" song
A palm for nurses, ain't have they scrubs on
"Things got too complicated for us" song
Shit, we should've left it in the crush zone
Yeah, but I just couldn't leave well enough alone
Yeah, I just couldn't leave well enough alone
Yeah, couldn't leave well enough alone
Now I'm singin' this fuckin' song

[Chorus: Wurld]
I know, I know, I know
You have been waitin'
I know, I know, I know
I know what you've been waiting for
You think I'll make you a break-up song
Do you really think you deserve it?
And I know you've been longin' for it
You think I'll make you a break-up...
I know, I know, you know
I know, you know, you don't-you don't deserve it
I know, I know, you know
And you know it
And you know it

[Chorus: Usher]
They tell me that I play a lot
But I don't think that they play enough
I don't know if I'm right or not
Tell me who ever stops growin' up
We're just big kids
The world's our toy
For boys and girls, for girls and boys
Tell me who ever stops growin' up

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, still ridin' big wheels, still addicted to J's
Favorite team on my fitted, in every color they make
I paint the town and every city I stay
ADD or you just never really learn how to play
A livin' breathin' walkin' memory on Memory Lane
Tell me are we really movin' or just dreamin' in place?
What's today? Outer space, still I'm searching somethin' great (somethin' great)
A new museum of broken toys, just tryin' to fill a void
Yeah, I wake up a different year, different peers
Tables turned, I tried not to interfere
Yeah, shiftin' gear, tryna steer, things changed
See them gettin' smaller in my rear view mirror

[Pre-Chorus: B.o.B]
Are you here, are you really here, can you hear me clear?
Biggest fear, hate to say goodbye, hate to disappear
Yeah, tell me are you really here
If it's just imagination, hate to see you disappear

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
They tell me that I play a lot
But I don't think that they play enough
I don't know if I'm right or not
Tell me who ever stops growing up
We're just big kids
The world's our toy
For boys and girls, for girls and boys
Tell me who ever stops growin' up

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Yeah, how you expect to mean somethin' to the world
If the world don't mean somethin' to you? Ayy
Focusin' on all the negative
The only thing that's negative is somethin' in you, ayy
We become the people that hurt us the most
That's why the saying is, "Keep your enemies close"
Stop givin' attention to what you don't want in life
Or be prepared to experience it the most
I became everything I used to criticize
Had a look inside the critics' eyes, uh
Yeah, but all roads lead home
We just arrive at a different time

[Pre-Chorus: B.o.B]
Are you here, are you really here, can you hear me clear?
Biggest fear, hate to say goodbye, hate to disappear
Yeah, tell me are you really here
If it's just imagination, hate to see you disappear

[Chorus: Usher, Cee-Lo Green & (B.o.B)]
They tell me that I play a lot (too much, too much)
But I don't think that they play enough (right, right, right)
I don't know if I'm right or not (not, not, not)
Tell me who ever stops growin' up (right, right, right)
We're just big kids
The world's our toy
For boys and girls, for girls and boys
Tell me who ever stops growin' up
Tell me who ever stops growin' up

[Verse 1]
What's up with this faggot?
Fuck is with this nigga?
Why is he still rapping?
He even wears the fashion
Should've stuck to makin' pop commercial smashes
Seriously
That's why people don't take you seriously
That's why we don't wanna hear nothin' you say
'Cause you ain't the man that you appear to be
No, nigga, seriously
We don't wanna hear your conspiracies
And we don't wanna hear your political views 'bout extraterrestrial activity
Look, nigga, make up your mind
How much longer you gon' wait to decide?
You was kickin' some dangerous lines
Now buyin' your shit a waste of my time
Nigga, what's up with you?
That's why all my niggas don't fuck with you
And that's why we don't come to your after parties
'Cause we don't wanna hang in the club with you
It's only two type of niggas
A street nigga and a you type of nigga
A coon type of nigga
Prolly born with a new silver spoon type of nigga
A new type of nigga
A sell out surrounded by wealth
You should've been one of the greats
Now you just sound like everyone else

[Verse 2]
Hello?
Bob, what are you doin'? What are you doin'?
You losin' your core, fan base and your viewers
Let me show you how to flow, show you how to make music
Obviously you clueless, how I know? 'Cause I'm Jewish
Oh, is that unruly? For me to say so rudely?
What if I stand on trial? What if I stand on jury?
What are we on TV? Who's the judge? Judge Judy?
What am I supposed to return all these cars and jewelry?
Like I don't even know how the flow supposed to go
Like I don't even know how the show supposed to flow
Like I don't even know how the beat supposed to sound
Like I don't even know where the notes supposed to go
Like I don't even know how my soul's supposed to feel
Like I ain't supposed to win, like I ain't supposed to glow
But you'll never understand the way that I think
If you ain't grow up where they sold dope before
Oh, number one draft pick, number one draft pick
Oh, he's nice for a black guy, oh, he's smart for a rapper
Oh, that's who he's with? Oh, she's cute for a black chick
Oh, he's actually cool, I went to school with him actually
Actually, he could've had a masterpiece
Now it's just a fuckin' catastrophe
Anyway, get Fitz on the phone
Tell him send it over to mastering

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Like I don't belong
I feel like I don't belong
Like I don't belong
Like a extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial, oh
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial, oh

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, basically I'm an alien to y'all
I guess I'm, speakin' in different languages than y'all
I guess, all you know is my alias is all
I stepped into the Hall of Fame and put my frame on the wall
I'm like a Michelangelo paintin' that hangs in the vault
They gated me off, by Hendrix while he plays the guitar
Never had friends but me and Franklin was dawgs
Somewhere between insane and famous, guess my brain's a lil' off
I'm, I'm in the b-b-basement havin' d-d-dangerous typa thoughts
I pace for hours, hit the fuckin' vaporizer and cough
Kill everythin' I see and leave behind a mountain of chalk
I took the hand that I was dealt and made a house outta cards
You can't compare me to anyone, swag on Area 51
Blowin' purple crop circles, pack is loud as a intercom
Anti-gravity moon suit
Went from bein' who are you to chillin' with the who's who
Paranoid of more than story-tales in science fiction
Sleepin' with a fat burner like I'm tryna watch my figure
Wanna cut me out the picture, get some bigger scissors
I-I stop shittin' on these niggas, but I never been a quitter
Yeah, so join the B.o.B hate fest
I would say, "Fuck ya" but I practice in safe sex
Signin' off, young Jedi on the red eye
Rap god, I should have my own prayer line
Amen, Ray Bands

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Like I don't belong
I feel like I don't belong
Like I don't belong
Like a extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial, oh
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial, oh

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Oh my God, it's the Martian
Stuntin' in them Son of Mars Jordans
It must be the shoes, the stars in the skies won't start 'em
Far from the norm', bitch, I'm Norman Bates awkward
But nothing's far fetched when a underdog's barkin'
But they could get checked, if I don't sign my goons forge it
I don't phone home, I phone homies
And catch you at your home with your homies, spoil a moment
Extra-extra-terrestrial, extra clips, extra bitch
Homie, I don't fear shit like exorcist your neck'll twist
Gettin' high on extra shit with extra kick to kick my ass
And after I put all bullshit to the side, I lick my hands from a Different world's Dwayne Wayne
Unexplained things goin' in my strange brain
Unidentified flyin' object Wayne's plane
'Cause I be on that Mary, I don't fuck with plain Jane
Drugs in the backpack, no room for E.T
Eyes on my kneecaps, don't look, I'm knee deep
All I do is fall back, smoke kush and keep seeds
Swallow 'em with some water, cut myself and bleed weed
Having trouble bein' human, let alone a human being
Have trouble shootin' a breeze not a M-16 (Bop)
I fear what I don't understand and that would be my own fear
And they don't understand me, I know I don't belong here
Tunechi

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Like I don't belong
I feel like I don't belong
Like I don't belong
Like a extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial, oh
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial, oh

You was just on my dick just 5 yesterdays
Backstab on your resumé
Yee, yee, Kevin you ain't even got your rent paid

Huh, look, DJ's say they support, but they still phoney
They don't play my shit 'less I got Tip on it
They don't play your shit 'less it's a diss on it
Down to die for this shit, bet I live for it
For this moment
Had to vent so I hit up the big homie
Niggas don't even buy albums
But niggas still do anything for a deal, homie
Act like this shit don't apply to you, huh
Been in the game, look at how they do, huh
Why do yes mans start off ever sentence
With, "Dog, I wouldn't lie to you"?
Swag is so malleable, covered in valuables
I done accomplished, start what I set out to do
Any obstacle is not insurmountable
Bankroll uncountable, down at the Fontainebleau
Bitches drinkin' Rosé like it's Mountain Dew
Guess what she down to do, roll up a pound or two
Bruh, she already jiggin', ain't no turnin' back
I can no longer be held accountable
Why you make all that nigga music?
All you play is that nigga music
Call it what you want
But it ain't an anthem 'til the strippers moving
(But it ain't an anthem 'til the strippers moving)

[Chorus]
I guess I got a short attention span
I learned it, get it straight from the source, fuck the middle man
Huh, oh, you hating? Don't be mad, don't be salty, don't be bitter, man
I learned it, get it straight from the source, fuck the middle man
Don't I deliver man -liver man

Mister, Bobby BandsI

[Chorus]
I tried to take the high road
Let bygones be bygones
I tried to take the high road
But now another life's gone
What you expect from me?
To turn the other cheek?
All you bring is war, asking me for peace
What you expect from me, when all you bring is greed
All you bring is war, asking me for peace
But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: B.o.B.]
Yeah, they say let's make America great again
Except for the slavery and genocide
When we killed all the natives and steal their tribes
And the time we denied the women's rights, huh
Talkin' 'bout great, like the AIDS outbreak
Like when they brought crack cocaine to the hood
Like when they brought heroin to the states
Look, justice is not on the internet
Equality don't have a Twitter account
The last words that a man should ever hear
Should never be, "Get on the ground"
Our culture so misunderstood, it's cloudy up over the hood
I'm thinkin' about packin' my bags and leavin' this country for good
Glock, Glock in my car for your probable cause
'Cause even the law don't follow the law
Guess it's my fault for being black
A country built on my people backs
Up in first class, yeah, my seat is back
Even when I'm bored and I'm tryna see my past
Tell me, if you had a chance, would you go back in time to see the past?
Waitin', waitin', waitin' for reparation
For the end of segregation
All we got was a month and a television station
All they teach is slavery and we celebrate it
They turn the cheek if we should perish, huh
But just remember you can't spell America without Eric, Bandz

[Chorus]
I tried to take the high road
Let bygones be bygones
I tried to take the high road
But now another life's gone
What you expect from me?
To turn the other cheek?
All you bring is war, asking me for peace
What you expect from me, when all you bring is greed
All you bring is war, asking me for peace
But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
By any means necessary
Lately too many mommas out here bearin' babies
Really ain't safe 'round here no more
Scared of the law when they head outdoors
And will we ever be at  peace, man? I ain't sure
But for now I'm like Malcolm out the window, it's simple altercation
Got these motherfuckers blazin'
And I ain't tryna say bye to my kinfolk
They choke us out like what they need a noose for?
Gentrify like fuck wherever you go
Prison walls nowadays big biz
Give us dope then lock us up to get riches
Then send us out to a job we can't get
You had that nigga flipped now you back in the system
That's a cold game, man, aww dog
If there's a God pray she listenin'
The president don't give a fuck about us
The government don't give a fuck either
They talkin' make America great again
I just wanna save my people
I just want that 40 acres and a mule
Another promise didn't fall through
Just a whole lot of propaganda and lyin' to me and you
I tried to take the high road

[Chorus]
I tried to take the high road
Let bygones be bygones
I tried to take the high road
But now another life's gone
What you expect from me?
To turn the other cheek?
All you bring is war, asking me for peace
What you expect from me, when all you bring is greed
All you bring is war, asking me for peace
But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece
But now I gotta piece piece piece
Yeah, yeah

[Intro]
30, you a fool for this one
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I ain't been this fucked up in a while
Don't know how I made it to the house
Woke up with two bitches in my house
Talkin' 'bout they wanna have my child
Shawty, then the next thing (Finesse, finesse)
She tried to finesse me (Finesse, finesse)
Say, say, say she like it rough, she like it wild
I say who am I to let her down
Now she running in and out the shower
At the same time, running out of towels
Yes, if she can hold a couple thou'
If I give it to her, she gon' run her mouth
She tried to finesse me, finesse me (Finesse, finesse, finesse, finesse)

[Chorus]
If I had a son, would you lie for me?
If I had a Honda, would you ride for me?
If I ain't make it home, would you cry for me?
Motherfuckin' liar
She tried to finesse me, finesse me (Finesse, finesse)
Say, say, say she like it rough, she like it wild
I say who I am to let her down

[Verse 2]
The fountain of youth, I think I done found it
How you say your name? I can't pronounce it
Fly and a bitch you can go out with
They probably gon' ask me to buy them outfits
She know the promoters and all the bouncers
She's watchin' my money like an accountant
She said I'm about to make an announcement
"Bob, I think I deserve an allowance"
And then the next thing
I woke up in the west wing
She say she like it rough, she like it wild
Ghetto bitch, I think she wet the towels
Now she runnin' in and out the shower
At the same time, fuckin' up the couch
She wanted me to hit it for a hour
If I give it to her, she gon' run her mouth
She tried to finesse me, finesse me (Finesse, finesse, finesse, finesse)

[Chorus]
If I had a son, would you lie for me?
If I had a Honda, would you ride for me?
If I ain't make it home, would you cry for me?
Motherfuckin' liar
She tried to finesse me, finesse me (Finesse, finesse)
Say she like it rough, she like it wild
I say who am I to let her down

[Outro]
If I had a someone, would you lie for me?
If I had a Honda, would you ride for me?
If I ain't make it home, would you cry for me?
Motherfuckin' liar
She tried to finesse me, finesse me (Finesse, finesse)

[Intro: London Jae]

Yeah, hold up

Dabbin' (Spell that shit)
D - A - A - B - B - I - N
Hold up, bae, roll up, bae
'Bout to pour a four up, bae
I just got some head from shawty
I don't even know her yet
Real strong, real grown
Your boy ain't spazzin' on me, real feel homie
This fresh, rockin' Polo everythin' to the neck
Got five karats all in the grill, homie
Car foreign, y'all boring
Got TVS all in the whip watchin' hard porn
Rifle cocked .40 Glock
I'm tweak, tweak, tweak tweakin'
Boy stop, girl gone, get my syrup on
What the word on the curb, homie?
All my niggas got furs on
Geeked up in the club last night
Everythin' was a blur, homie
Benz blue, Jimmy Choo
In the booty club, find me a girl to get tanned to
This Cartier lens blue
I got a pocket full of dead white men, we friends too

[Chorus: London Jae]
I been spazzin', spazzin', spazzin'
I been tweakin', tweakin', tweakin'
I can't stand up, stand up, stand up

[Verse 2: B.o.B.]
Huh, I ain't got the illuminati money
But I got the boy you shouldn't try me money
Wonder why they haven't heard an album from me
Didn't sell my soul, they tried to buy it from me
Ha ha, not for sale
Ain't a fan of fairy tales
Ain't no air of oxygen, in outer space
So tell me how the hell to fuel a rocket ship?
Now how does it throttle? The truth is a hard pill to swallow
Landing footage from Apollo look like amateur night down at the Apollo
And they say in space, it's four thousand degrees
But it's only seven elements available that can withstand that much heat
Look, now all these niggas political now
Claimin' they woke 'cause it's trendier now
Overnight activist
Even the President's runnin' the world from a Twitter account
Uh, geekin' often, Steven Hawkins
'Bout my coin like meter parkin'
Off the wall like Peter Parker
Here let's get to squeezin' on you like some squeegee water
Keep the garter bitch, Bandz

[Chorus: London Jae]
I been spazzin', spazzin', spazzin'
I been tweakin', tweakin', tweakin'
I can't stand up, stand up, stand up
I been geekin', geekin', geekin'
Spazzin', tweakin'
Spazzin', geekin'
I been tweakin'
I been tweakin'
I been spazzin', spazzin', spazzin'
I been tweakin', tweakin', tweakin'
I can't stand up, stand up, stand up
I be geekin', geekin', geekin'
Spazzin', tweakin'
Spazzin', geekin'
I been tweakin'
I been tweakin'

[Outro: B.o.B.]
Stand up, send a bitch out, hit her without a condom
Smell that bag or marijuana, where the turn us to a stunter
I been comin' your Rollie, huh, do what you tryna, stuntin'
I run 'em up, dumb, not enough money, ooh yeah

[Intro]
Substance
Sub-sub-substance
Sub-sub-substance
Yeah, uh, substance

[Chorus]
Abuse, abuse, yeah, abuse, what
Substance abuse, abuse, look, abuse, what
Substance abuse, abuse, abuse
Talkin' 'bout weed and alcohol, weed and alcohol
Substance abuse, abuse, yeah, abuse, what
Substance abuse, abuse, look, abuse, what
Substance abuse, abuse, abuse
Talkin' 'bout weed and alcohol, weed and alcohol

[Verse 1]
Abusin' from sick, high choosin'
Nigga, God bless you, I'm a god, bless you
Four projects in, what you thought I was gon' do?
Smoke any less weed, pop any less shrooms?
Bob, Bob, Bob, this is your mind, okay
This is your mind on drugs
You have any idea what this means?
It means I'm high as fuck
They prescribe teens all type of stuff
Shit that calmed you down, shit that hyped you up
Even the side effects got side effects
As if you ain't already depressed enough
So what is abuse to smoke out, I don't need an excuse
Not even for pharmacy use
You just say no, I say let's roll up a doob
And turn into a puddle of soup
Harmful for who, harmful like formula food
Or hormones that farmers produce?
I come with the truth, I like in the now with no roof
Don't know what a doctor would do
When people get high, I just get high off this weed
Don't need no alternative route
I'm stuck on the moon, don't fit in, but I'm in the loop
And no, there ain't no substitutes for

[Chorus]
This substance abuse, abuse, yeah, abuse, what
Substance abuse, abuse, look, abuse, what
Substance abuse, abuse, abuse
Talkin' 'bout weed and alcohol, weed and alcohol
Substance abuse, abuse, yeah, abuse, what
Substance abuse, abuse, look, abuse, what
Substance abuse, abuse, abuse
Talkin' 'bout weed and alcohol, weed and alcohol

[Verse 2]
Yeah, some stories too true to tell
And some made up 'cause these days good music don't always mean music sells
You either star in a TV show, sell dope
Scams, or have shoes to sell
Huh, it's all about the headlines
All about the rumors and the groupie tells
Life is a choice and I choose 'em well
Might as well jump a coupe off the motherfuckin' roof
And parachute in a suit, 100 bitches below
200 titties salute, salute, salute, huh (substance)
So what is abuse? This shit they prescribe to the youth
Was on 'til several law suits
How they get approved and then from the shelves it's removed?
A new one gets reintroduced
Who's makin' the rules?
The war that's on drugs did to weed what prohibition did to booze
But weed doesn't kill
Can't say the same if you drunk and decide you gon' go for a cruise
The war that's on drugs actually creates all the violence
And problems we see on the news
I'm callin' a truce, they been usin' all kind of nukes
But the public's no longer confused

[Chorus]
This substance abuse, abuse, yeah, abuse, what
Substance abuse, abuse, look, abuse, what
Substance abuse, abuse, abuse
Talkin' 'bout weed and alcohol, weed and alcohol
Substance abuse, abuse, yeah, abuse, what
Substance abuse, abuse, look, abuse, what
Substance abuse, abuse, abuse
Talkin' 'bout weed and alcohol, weed and alcohol

[Skit]
Do you live a healthy lifestyle?
Do you have a happy loving family and a dog?
Well you can fuck that up here
If you take Kaporthaflol
Man, I had a paying job
Man, I had a nice car that was almost paid off
And then I went and took Kaporthaflol
And that shit fucked my whole life up
Hi, I'm James, I'm 33 and I used to have a girlfriend
And when she took Kaporthaflol  she fucked the whole squad
Hi, I'm Henry and I sell my body for Kaporthaflol, And I'm Tim and I sell Henry for Kaporthaflol
Side effects may include nausea, back pain, crippling depression
Suicidal thoughts, homicidal thoughts
Headache, diarrhea, financial dependencies
Infidelity, unemployment, sign of bankruptcies
Schizophrenia, insomnia, PSTD, ADD, ADHD
Human trafficking, bulimia and chronic paralysis
Do not operate machinery while taking Kaporthaflol
If you take any other drugs, talk to your doctor about Kaporthaflol

[Verse 1]
I got a new confession
I battle with depression
I got a lotta trust issues
I guess I feel neglected
I used to have a message
Now I'm just fucking reckless
I spend a lotta time
Just tryna be accepted
I cancelled all my shows
I burned all my clothes
I'm going out my mind
I just need to be alone

[Chorus]
Like the snow, like the snow
In a avalanche
It just rolls and it rolls
'TiI it finally lands
It rolls
Cash, money, hoes
That's all a nigga knows
Cash, money, hoes
That's all a nigga knows

[Verse 2]
I'm sick of your suggestions
I hate the stupid questions
Just wanna be myself
I hate to be corrected
They say I need a ration
They say I ain't interestin'
If you lookin' for a friend
Then you in the wrong profession
I cut off all my hoes
I smoke up all my 'dro
When you going through some shit
You just hope nobody knows

[Chorus]
Like the snow, like the snow
In a avalanche
It just rolls and it rolls
'TiI it finally lands
It rolls
Cash, money, hoes
That's all a nigga knows
Cash, money, hoes
That's all a nigga knows

[Outro]
Like the snow, like the snow
It just rolls and it rolls
It rolls
Cash, money, hoes
That's all a nigga knows
Cash, money, hoes
That's all a nigga knows

[Verse 1]
I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here, and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free, as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

[Verse 2]
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spent the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish, to swim away with the fish
Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you

[Outro]
We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
And you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start
A dream come true in Malibu

[Verse 1]
Anything that you want from me
Girl, you can get it any time, any place
And I'll be your servant, your slave
Your everything you ever wanted, baby
Just make one wish and I'll become your genie
Your go-getter, your "bring it back and give it to you," baby
I walk over that rainbow and deliver to you that pot of gold
Got the whole Earth in a box, wrapped in a bow for you

[Hook]
It's your world, yeah
It's your world, baby
It's your world, baby
And everything in it
It's your world, yeah
It's your world, baby
It's your world
Girl, if you ask, it shall be given
It's your world
It's your world

[Verse 2]
All of your worries, your cares, your doubts
Give them to me and I'll erase them for you
I'll be your heaven, your blessing, no stressing
Girl, I'll make all your dreams come true
No matter what it is, just say what it is
And I will do it for you
I'll walk a mile, I'll swim the Nile, I'll vow
To stick my finger in the ground
And turn this Earth around for you

[Hook]
‘Cause it's your world
It's your world, baby
It's your world, baby
And everything in it
It's your world
It's your world
It's your world
Girl, if you ask, it shall be given
It's your world
It's your world

[Verse 3]
See, a woman like you, babe
Shouldn't have to ask for nothing, baby, no, no, no
You should have the world, baby
Right in the palms of your hands, oh oh
Just tell me what to do
Make your life a better life for you
Anything your heart desire, babe
See, I am born to make it happen, babe
All you've gotta do, oh, no, no
Is tell me that it's me you want loving you
And as long as you keep giving me that sweet love
Point to it, baby, and it belongs to you
If it's money you want (it's nothing)
Want me to pay your bills (it's nothing)
Buy you nice things (it's nothing)
Shopping sprees (it's nothing)
Oh ho ho ho ho (it’s nothing)
If you’re in need of love (it’s nothing)
It don’t matter what (it’s nothing)
Even the moon and the stars above (it’s nothing)
You can have my house (it’s nothing)
You can have my cars (it’s nothing)
I’ll cut it out of me (it’s nothing)
And give you my heart (it’s nothing)
See, the universe (it’s nothing)
And all of the planets (it’s nothing)
Belongs to you (it’s nothing)
Just reach up and grab it (it’s nothing)
It’s your world, woo hoo, baby
You deserve the whole world, and everything in it
It’s your world
I’ll wrap it up, and give it to you
Anything you want, anything you need, I will surely do
It’s your world
See, what you what you want, baby, I got it
Girl, believe it—it’s your world
Hey, all of your hopes and dreams, I’m all about it
Hey, it’s your world, yeah
And everything, and everything in it, baby
Listen to me, girl—it’s your world
See, you ain’t gotta question (no)
‘Cause there’s no need to ask (no)
Long as there’s a heaven up above and God’s a fact
It’s your world
It’s your world

It’s your world
Yeah, it’s your world, baby
It’s your world, baby
And everything in it
It’s your world
Yeah, it’s your world, baby
It’s your world, baby
And everything in it
It’s your world
Yeah, it’s your world, baby
It’s your world, baby
And everything in it
It’s your world
Yeah, it’s your world, baby
It’s your world, baby
And everything in it
It’s your world

[Intro]
Baby (oh baby)
I know we had an argument and all
(Ooh, babe)
And I must have said some pretty foul shit but
(Mmm, mmm)
I just want you to know that I ain't mean none of that
(Baby, baby)
None of it

[Verse 1]
Now I was supposed to be a man about it
Shoulda never left your side; no way, no how
Put too many years in this relationship
And it's not that serious for us to split
Now I admit sometimes I make mistakes
But still I appreciate the love we make
Stop at the door and put your bags back down
Now, baby, please can we work this out

[Chorus]
Now I might say you can walk
(But I don't mean it)
And I might name call
(I don't mean it)
I may pull some silly stunts
(Uhm mmm)
But that's just a front, I don't mean it
(Now wait a minute hear me out)
Now I may holler at you
(I don't mean it)
And I may tell you we're through
(But I don't mean it, no, no)
May give you looks that can kill
(Can kill)
But it's not for real
(Not for real)
I don't mean it
(I don't mean it, hey)

[Verse 2]
Now I was supposed to be more understanding
Instead of trying to be so damn demanding
Baby, I'm willing to drop my ego
And do the things I should have done and more
See, I know that I can be a better man
Girl, all you gotta do is take my hand
Promise this time I'm going all the way
And show you all the reasons why you stayed

[Chorus]
Now I might say you can walk
(But I don't mean it, no, no)
And I might name call
(Girl I don't mean it)
I may pull some silly stunts
(Ooh, yeah)
But that's just a front, I don't mean it
(Listen, baby)
Now I may holler at you
(But I don't mean it)
And I may tell you we're through
(Girl, you should know I don't mean it)
May give you looks that can kill
(Um mmm)
But it's not for real
I don't mean it
(Come here, girl)

[Bridge]
See, I never meant to break you down
And make you cry (make you cry)
Oh, please, baby, please, turn back around
Don't you say goodbye (say goodbye)
Sometimes I know that I can take it
Just a little bit too far
But, yo, my heart is good (heart is good)
So baby, you don't have to worry
You're gonna see a change
Girl, you know I love ya
Even though I may say…

[Chorus]
Now I might say you can walk
(I don't mean it)
And I might name call
(But I don't mean it)
I may pull some silly stunts
(Hey)
But that's just a front
(Hey, hey)
I don't mean it
(I don't mean it, I don't mean it)
Now I may holler at you
(When I'm hollering at you)
And I may tell you we're through
(I never mean it when I say we're through)
May give you looks that can kill (kill)
But it's not for real (real)
I don't mean it
(I don't mean it)
Now I might say you can walk
(I don't mean it)
And I might name call
(But I don't mean it)
I may pull some silly stunts
(Hey)
But that's just a front
(Hey, hey)
I don't mean it
(I don't mean it, I don't mean it)
Now I may holler at you
(When I'm hollering at you)
And I may tell you we're through
(I never mean it when I say we're through)
May give you looks that can kill (kill)
But it's not for real (real)
I don't mean it
(I don't mean it)
Now I might say you can walk
(I may say that you can walk but I don't)
And I might name call
(Girl I promise I don't mean it)
I may pull some silly stunts (silly stunts)
But that's just a front (just a front)
I don't mean it
(Thinking I'm cool, but I'm a fool)
Now I may holler at you
(Caught up in my pride, you see)
And I may tell you we're through
(When I know you are my pride to be)
May give you looks that can kill
(You opened up my eyes and now I see)
But it's not for real
I don't mean it
(That I'm walking on a two-way street)
Now I might say you can walk
(Girl, I don't mean it, I don't mean it)
And I might name call
(I don't mean it, I don't mean it)
I may pull some silly stunts
(I don't mean it)
But that's just a front
(I don't mean it)
I don't mean it
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Now I may holler at you
And I may tell you we're through
May give you looks that can kill
But it's not for real
I don't mean it

[Intro: R. Kelly + K. Michelle]
Ooh, yeah, aaah baby
Said I'm feeling pretty good right now baby, ooh boy
Good about our lovin', darling, listen...

[Verse 1: R. Kelly + K. Michelle + both]
Like the world goes around every day, baby
That is how you spin me
Might as well call me a telegram, baby
'Cause darling, that's just how you send me, yeah
I might as well take me a pen and sign a waver
To be yours for the rest of my life (Oh, baby)
You rescued me from heartache just like a savior
Now being in your arms is like my paradise

Listen, baby…
Ain't no love like your love, ain't no kiss like your kiss
Felt a whole lot of things but nothing's ever felt like this
You're a genie to me, baby, the way you grant my wish
And tonight, we’re gonna let the world hear it
This is how our love is
(You and me forever, baby; Sing it, darlin')
This is how our love is
(Can't nobody come between, nah, baby)

[Verse 2: R. Kelly + K. Michelle + both]
Listen, honey…
Ain't no doubt what we got, baby, is one of a kind
We're in the hall of fame as the greatest love of all time
So many said that this love wouldn't last too long
But we've got the victory, darling, and proved them all wrong
Just like the sun comes in, chased away the rain (Ah, girl)
See, I love you, boy, you take away my pain
And it don't matter where you are, just call me, baby
'Cause I'll run a million miles just to get you, baby

Listen, honey, now…
Ain't no love like your love, ain't no kiss like your kiss
Felt a whole lot of things but nothing's ever felt like this
You're a genie to me, baby, the way you grant my wish
And tonight, we’re gonna let the world hear it
This is how our love is
(You and me forever, baby; Sing it to me, darlin')
This is how our love is
(Can't nobody come between us, baby)

[Bridge]
Now let me tell you how I feel
See, our love is like an antidote
And we can heal the whole wide world with it, darling
Preach to me
This love is like a people's hope
Something out of hand, and baby, ‘cause it’s got a calling
Oh, girl, when we're touching (Touching)
Oh, when we're feeling (Feeling)
It's crazy like walking on the ceiling
This is how our love is
(Baby, you and me; Sing to me, girl)
This is how our love is
(Baby, and can't nobody come between; No, baby)
This is how our love is
(Rain, sleet or snow, I want the whole wide world to know)
This is how our love is
(Forever and a day, (Hey), it will always be this way)
This is how our love is
(So tell them to, take it or leave it)
(You and me together, take it or leave it)
This is how our love is
(Take it or leave it; take it or leave it)
This is how our love is

[Verse 1]
One look, one touch, one step in the room
One gesture, one smile, and I'm in love with you
One talk, one date, one piece of your mind
One word, one embrace, and I'm in paradise

Magic, girl, when we locked eyes (Oh, and now)
I believe in love at first sight

[Chorus]
'Cause just like that
You got me, baby
Just like that
Mind, body, soul
Just like that
You walked into my life, baby
Just like that
Okay rest of me, let's go

[Verse 2]
One joke, one laugh, one flick of your hair
One feeling, one stroke, and girl, I'm right there
One record, one dance, and we're in the groove
One mmm, one ah, we're right in the mood
Magic, girl, when we locked eyes
(Magic when we lock, and now)
I believe in love at first sight

[Chorus]
'Cause just like that
You got me, baby
Just like that
You got my mind, body, soul
Just like that
Since you walked into my life, baby
Just like that
I'm like, okay rest of me, let's go

[Bridge]
Instantly you changed my world
From the darkness to light
Forever you'll be my girl
And I've known it since that night, baby girl

[Chorus]
Just like that
You got me, baby
Just like that
Got my mind, body, soul
Just like that
Since you walked into my life, baby
Just like that
I'm like, okay rest of me let's go
Just like that
Just like that, you got me, baby
Just like that
You got my mind, body, soul
Just like that
Since you walked into my life, baby
Just like that
Girl, you brought a change

Just like that
Now my life will never be the same
Just like that
Just when it was slippin' out my finger
It's like you appeared into my life
Just like that
And baby, as sure as I'm a singer
You'll be right here by my side
Just like that

[Intro]
(Why yes, fuck you too)
What up, world?
You know when I said the diamonds was on prom date
That meant they was dancin' under the dark light
In New York I Milly Rock
Got it in my sock
Fifty off the wall
And I press rerock
Got it in my sock
Got a lil' thot
That's a lil' boat, boy, that's a lil' yacht
(Nah, I'm just playing, let me get this shit for real tho)

[Verse]
I get money, money, money motherfucker like I'm Jordan
It's the nigga flyin' foreign, make your bitches not important
Milly rockin' through the city pop a biddie by the garden
Know you niggas can't afford it
And these bitches can't ignore me
I did shit like dory, I'm with some white shorty
And the bitch is like 40, she singing Mike Shorey
In the port loose ridin' out the Porsche coupe glidin'
If you try me nigga I be off the Porsche through slidin'
It's just me and lil' Aggy, Portuguese lil' baddie
Pourin' drink off in the soda, puttin' weed off in the baggy
I be off in the caddie with a freak that's off a addy
Tryin' fuck me to the beat is like the beat is off badly
Fleeing off to Cali, I'll be back in the morning
Them boys diss me in the night, I get 'em clapped by the morning
Got the money clubbin' on the dollar stackin' and joinin'
In the back of this foreign, I keep a cool bitch wit' me
This never slackin' or borin', never lackin' I'm blowin'
And any nigga try and ho us, we feel the world owe us
I bet your girl know us, Weatherman Riley
Two bad bitches like Kendall and Kylie
Let your man try me be another man dying
I'm a young sergeant, oh and by the way
I just beat my gun charges, lawyer like a maid
They just sweeping dumb charges
Shout out Jim Lewis I won't keep you bombarded
But we some young bosses
Can't nobody ever try to do it like we do
Playboy like Carti I want fuck Cardi B too
Wonder if I slide in that DM what it lead to?
Puttin' in position like we in a magazine shoot
Nigga, I'm the man 10 bitches, Magnolia
Shout out to the fans, African and Angola, yeah
Throw the damn Rollie up, throw the damn Rollie up
Rollie so heavy that the bitches can't hold it up
Score so much they gotta throw a damn goalie up
Niggas say they know but they don't know enough, you know it's us
Shawty wanna fuck me for Chanel, she a coconut
Skrtin' through the parkin' lot with doughnuts in the car clutch
All 30 of us, 26 bitches, four sluts
All of us going up, the bank account's growin' up
Shawty threw the pussy at me, tore it up
Now the only way to get it back, she gotta sew it up
Yeah, in New York I Milly rock, I'm on any block
Hit that bitch on Betty block
Gave this dick to 20 thots, uh
Got it in my sock, uh
40 on the wop, uh
30 clip inside a extendo on the Glock, ooh

[Outro]
We just getting started
Nothin' gon' be safe
I'm hoppin' on everything
Bodied, nigga

[Intro]
Shit, ever since I got money
I ain't been happy like I used to
They say, "You got pay the cost to be a boss"
Check this
When you the nigga with the money
Somebody go to jail, you gotta pay they bail
Somebody die, they gon' turn to you for the funeral
But I just be thinking like, "When I'm gon' be able to turn to somebody, shit"
Bosses got feelings too
I done did shit for niggas a thousand times
Told 'em, "No" one time and watch 'em talk about me crazy, run and bite my back out
But I still stood tall

[Chorus]
Uh, when you sitting at the top and you think you seen it all
Caught up with your dreams with nobody else to call
With tears up on my face, 'cause I know I'm gon' be straight
Had to cut a couple homies, had to learn from my mistakes
This the price of being great, oh, this the price of being great
They hate you when you're winning but they love you when you're break
This the price of being great, this the price of being great
Oh, this the price of being great, they hate you when you're winning
But they love it when you when you break, this the price of being great

[Verse 1]
This the price of having money and the price of being great
Had to cut a couple homies, never heard them tell me thanks
I've been washing all my problems with these percs and all this drank
All that shit just made me tank, had me drawn let me paint
4 in the morning 88, graveyard shiftin' it
A dollar to my name and I remembered it
A nigga said I owe 'em, how? that shit the sound ridiculous
Tell a nigga "No", and they gon' show you who they really is
Trappin' since little kid, did a little bid
But I bounced back like the bullet did when it ricocheted, hit the little kid
This what it is, when the ice cream truck come through
Ain't have a dollar, that shit just made me to a boss, word to my father, woah

[Chorus]
Uh, when you sitting at the top and you think you seen it all
Caught up with your dreams with nobody else to call
With tears up on my face, 'cause I know I'm gon' be straight
Had to cut a couple homies, had to learn from my mistakes
This the price of being great, oh, this the price of being great
They hate you when you're winning but they love you when you're break
This the price of being great, this the price of being great
Oh, this the price of being great, they hate you when you're winning
But they love it when you when you break, this the price of being great

[Verse 2]
Yeah, ain't no price on the money, ain't no price in the Lord
I got outta the system, I jumped right on the Forbes
When I got out the ghetto, I jumped right on the tour
When I stunt on that Instagram, I'm just showing them more
I'm just showing them better how to make it through any weather
Back when I said I would make it they was telling me never
Only get one chance better take it, only one shot, boy, you better
How you survive in the jungle, he be movin' so clever
I'm talkin' Tony Baretta to make it back to my son
Talkin' crab in the barrel, they pull you back where I'm from
That's why we loadin' extendos up in the back of the gun
Posted up on that corner see the paddy wagon, we run, whoa

[Chorus]
Uh, when you sitting at the top and you think you seen it all
Caught up with your dreams with nobody else to call
With tears up on my face, 'cause I know I'm gon' be straight
Had to cut a couple homies, had to learn from my mistakes
This the price of being great, oh, this the price of being great
They hate you when you're winning but they love you when you're break
This the price of being great, this the price of being great
Oh, this the price of being great, they hate you when you're winning
But they love it when you when you break, this the price of being great

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches, and when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch and really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit, and when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I be with bitches that be with bitches that be with niggas with riches
I tell her, "Get him," she say, "I got you," I say, "No, bitch, I said get him"
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy, he hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs, it's a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin' so silly, I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say? Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)
You can get snaked, you can get faked out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tellin' your business, she tell me your business, you tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin', to you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide it tell me where it's hidden, she know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics, and meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains, we find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checkin', then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say, "What's wrong?" He say, "Nothin', keep restin'," she say, "What's missin'?" "How you know somethin' missin'?"
He scratch his head, she say, "Get back in bed," and she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say, "Ooh"

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches, then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches that's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind and tell them hoes, "Don't be so obvious!"
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell, she bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, "Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place," and if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware, she don't want love, she just want her share

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I know a bitch named Liz, this nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears, and then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people, and they already know him, and then I call Liz, and she say he comin' over
I say, "Good girl, just remember what I told you," she gave me the salute, I say, "Girl, you're a soldier"
We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up, walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked, they started French kissin' so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch, music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out of him, piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
"Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around, I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up, Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down"
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her, she a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after, if Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga, but think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga, I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drank on me, nigga, she slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture, Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga, you fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everythin' that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion, we have your attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga, now she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga
We just lookin' for the casserole, nigga, but she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga (Mona)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Lil Wayne]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup and a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter, four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh, probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona Lisa) Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it, make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree, sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi? Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the mornin' to The Great Gatsby, then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughin', I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy, Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy, bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me 'bout a motherfuckin' double standard, actin'
Fuckin' on another nigga, that's a negative alone, but you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No) You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick) (… lick me like a lollipop)
He on your fuckin' ringtone? Is that the shit that you do? Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews, I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder, forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma, daycare after school and she never did charge you
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up, you know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin', goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress, I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy, I'm killin' myself

[Outro: Lil Wayne and Kendrick Lamar]
She say, "Ooh, Daddy, ooh," Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile (Ooh), Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, "Ooh," no emotion (Ooh), Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah

[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Whatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga?
Whatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga?

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I'm sticking ice picks on the tip of ya dick
Give your testicles a swift kick, ain't that some shit?
Am I hard hard core? Harder than the Plymouth
It ain't no myth, it's a nigga with a spliff
And a chrome four fifth pressed on ya back
So what you want, nigga? How you wanna act?
I hope civilized cause I love to see niggas die
Brains all leaking out on the street
And the pastor preaching "He was a good man."
Played the bad man when the burner was in his hand
Now he's singing sad songs with Elvis
Three to the head, bout six cross the pelvis
You fuck with the high guy, ya die
You the same motherfucker yelling "Look up in the sky!"
I'm on some old neck shit
Suplex shit, hardcore sex shit
And TEC shit, whatchu want nigga?!

[Hook: ???, The Notorious B.I.G, talking]
Whatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga? (x8)
(Poppin' that straight up, niggas really know)
(True hardcore, fuck is wrong with you?)
(Junior M.A.F.I.A)
(OGB)
(50 Grand, yeah)

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
A repetitive loop
All I need to destroy a soloist or group
Huh, I put it to ya boy
Hope you got the scoop
Biggie Smalls, the rap genius
I keep the Glock by the penis, the cleanest cut
Fuck the sluts with the big humongous butts
Huh, I use a rubber, but
My style is gushy like the hooker's pussy
And it don't take a lot of back talk to push me
Into flamin' 'em, like that little nigga Damien
Pop 19 to my motherfuckin' cranium
Game tight, gun totin' motherfucker
Niggas in the grave thought Biggie was a sucker
I tricked 'em -- I gave 'em work then I sticked 'em
I stripped 'em, cause niggas don't want the friction
Told you before how I bring the drama
Slam Larry Johnson and his Grandmama
Whatchu want nigga?!

[Hook: ???]
Whatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga? (x8)

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Fuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga
When I get busy, throw your hands to the sky nigga
I got the illest of the ill mentality, niggas be grabbing me
Knowing that they'd rather be stabbing me
All up in my back, trying to take my track
When I used to sell crack, I ain't have problems like that
Street rules, watch your pockets and your jewels
A nigga front? Throw the gat to the fools
Tears don't effect me, I hit 'em with the TEC, G
Disrespect me? My potency is deadly
Once the venom hits the cerebellum
My lips get chapped, and my hards start swellin'
Keep the nine millimeter by the Peter
To kill a motherfucker, don't a think feel sweeter
Oooohh, it make my head hurt, the blood spurt
The robbery expert's berserk
Whatchu want nigga?!

[Hook: ???]
Whatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga?
Whatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga?
Whatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga?
Whatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga?
Whatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga?
Whatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga?
Whatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga?
Whatchu want nigga, whatchu whatchu want nigga?

[Intro: Nate Dogg]
Black Cadillac, on vogues
Sittin' back thinkin'
Thing ain't the same no mo'
We want Biggie
Big up to the east-coast Brooklyn don
Heads still bouncin'
Tell the DJ what we want (Biggie Smalls! Uh)
We want Biggie

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back
Talking about the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore
Appeal that you're screaming
Maybe I'm dreaming
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel one
Caps, I got to peel some
To let niggas know (let 'em know!)
That if you fuck with big-and-heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who - says me, the lyrical
Niggas saying: "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle!"
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggas acting shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smoking funk by the boxes, packing Glocks
It's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates
The funk, baby

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
When they ask us what we want (the funk)
We want the funk!
Where Brooklyn at? (I live for the funk)
Where Brooklyn at?( I die for the funk, baby)
Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at?
Live and die for the funk
We want the funk!
Where Brooklyn at? (I live for the funk)
Where Brooklyn at?( I die for the funk, baby)
Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at?

[Verse 2: Redman]
Aw, it's nothing but funk in this motherfucker here!
Ayo, it's Redman dog, you know the deal
I'm watching New Jack City in my steering wheel
Man I love for the funk, I'll kill that wheel
Nigga fucking large I'm in the NFL
Killer, the man on fire like Denzel
I rock steady, my heat'll make your wind-mill
That's real, dot, R-A-W, straight out my mother womb
Right to the rubber room, I'm psycho, automatics
Since a younging, blowing funk boosts with half-sticks
I ain't give a fuck, now I'm trying to own a mountain
Standing on it yelling "regular!"
B. Smalls, Nate Dogg on the same beat
We fuck hoes, send 'em home like the Yankees
Brick City, yeah nigga, a threat
That's how I act when Bad Boy cut Killa a check
Yep, haha

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
When they ask us what we want (the funk)
We want the funk!
Where Brooklyn at? (I live for the funk)
Where Brooklyn at?( I die for the funk, baby)
Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at?
Live and die for the funk
We want the funk!
Where Brooklyn at? (I live for the funk)
Where Brooklyn at?( I die for the funk, baby)
Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at?

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Real talk, nigga, Flip Mode Squad's in the building
Put your ones up, tribute the god, look
All gathered around, bounce to the funk
Got the whole club stink with the aroma of the skunk
Now, bang it out the trunk, nigga, ain't nothing change
Rep Big in a horde, like he still on St. James
Check it, nigga gon' see why we try
We continue to rep the funk in the name of the god B.I
Get dressed, mamis try to step up in the spotlight
We honoring one of the greatest,  yes we gotta rep him right
Homie I ain't done, let me keep giving you funk shit
Busta Bust does just what he do, now let me run shit
Yeah, peep heat we bringin', rep the funk to the fullest
Still, keep we keep drillin', niggas all up in they head
'Cause I said we always will, and
Put it down for Big-Heavy, still B.K. swinging
The funk, baby

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
When they ask us what we want (the funk)
We want the funk!
Where Brooklyn at? (I live for the funk)
Where Brooklyn at?( I die for the funk, baby)
Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at?
Live and die for the funk
We want the funk!
Where Brooklyn at? (I live for the funk)
Where Brooklyn at?( I die for the funk, baby)
Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at?

[Verse 1]
In the silence of our absence
Rings a sacred word
What a pity that it won't be heard
We're all just a waste of good meat
In a godless world
Throw my carcass in a wheelie bin
And won't you send a nice message to my girl?
How can you smile?
You must be sick or mad to stay on Earth
A dream of Escher, Kafka and all seven sins of Perth

[Verse 2]
There hangs the chandelier
There go the twelve-million sparks
Welcome to the polished steel room of earthly pleasures
Welcome to the dark
There's still a national park
Across the water from your parents' house

[Verse 3]
Would you give yourself a tombstone?
Would Cardinal Pell?
I don't even recognise my own home
We've built our own layer of hell
And the sun will hang and wait for the next parade
And the echo of us will fade
Erase all traces of colonial past
We've been here the whole time
Just as long as the Woodside's fine
We fly out (We fly out)
We fly in (We fly in)
For three whole weeks of carnal sin
But the ice and the iron is wearing me thin
Lest we forget (Lest we forget)
Lest we regret (Lest we regret)
Our bloody past
How long can the boomtown last?

[Part I: A]

[Verse]
Pax Americana, fax Australiana
Smoked a banana and visualised a liquid metal Virginia Woolf
Liposuction Tuesday, steak night Wednesday
Breast augmentation payed for caviar on Christmas Day
And if I work on an afternoon
By May, we'll both be on the moon
Touching glasses with Richard Branson
And his harpy queens
I'm too apathetic to defend my heterosexuality
But I'll not lie here on my phone while being fucked by the Man

[Interlude: radio noise/old sample fragments]
He—
The body of a man who died—
Do you wan—
Sixty seconds—

[Part II: B]

[Verse]
Angel, angel, you talked to me
And I don't even care if you were lying about being clean
Angel, you're still an angel despite the speed
Only seventeen, with blackened teeth
Angel, you talked to me
And I don't even care if you were lying about being clean
Angel, you're still an angel despite the speed
Only seventeen, with blackened teeth

[Verse 1]
A zen automaton
Couldn't crack that koan
And drive the sword of human guilt
Right up to its diamond hilt
I read it on my phone

[Verse 2]
Holy shit, is that Sir Ian McKellen leaning from the clouds?
Shooting lightning from his eyes all across the Burmese crowds?
I don't know much, but I know I don't like them at all
Oh, whatever they do, whoever they are
I read it on my phone

[Verse 3]
Paint me green and push me through the surgery door
Julienne my frontal lobe and bludgeon me with a two-by-four
And send me to the wild to eat and fuck, and fuck and eat
God, Father, give up your seat for the pregnant and the old
No, don't you know who that is? It's Ringo fucking Starr

[Verse 4]
It takes 1.56666666 fractions of the time
It took me to stand up and realise we need to die
In Silicon Valley, they're working in and for the greatest minds
A nihilist pact is just what logic prescribes
I feel like I could piss right out the window and hit the moon

[Chorus]
As far as I know
All that I want for Christmas
Is a TASCAM 388, don't you know?
Oh, and all I want for Christmas

[Verse]
I don't want a boat
Don't want universal remote
And I don't need you
Oh, no

[Chorus]
Oh, and all I want for Christmas
As far as I know (Oh)
All that I want for Christmas
Is a TASCAM 388, don't you know?
Oh, and all I want for Christmas

[Intro: radio noise/old sample fragments]
Pornography—
Prosecution for a number of years—
Deeper— *applause*

[Verse 1]
On the edge of the world
There's a limestone jail that stands
It's the work of convict hands
And we sleep on sacred bones
While the sea breeze hollow moans
And we sleep under languid fans
And beside our phones
And the very worst human beings I know are police or MPs
So we stare out to sea
And whisper to the sunset
Oh, it's nice to be

[Refrain]
On the edge of the world
On the edge of the world
On the edge of the world
On the edge of the world
On the edge of the world
On the edge of the world
On the edge of the world
On the edge of the world

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
And I feel like I'm stranded
It's nothing like I planned it
I should be on a star
Drunk at a Fitzroy bar
I'll trade the swans for bats
Live among the rats
Wear alluring hats
I'm gonna move to the East
And I'm never coming back

[Verse 3]
And if the highway gets you down
And if the violence gets you down
And if Lateline gets you down
And if your own faith gets you down
And if the cokeheads get you down
If Gina Rinehart gets you down
And if the white guilt gets you down
And if El Niño gets you down
We've got the water
We've got the water
We've got the water for now
We've got the water
We've got the water
We've got the water for now

[Outro]
Oh, well, actually
Rather than talk about it, I can read y—
Oh, that'd be great

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know how to count it
I can count with my eyes closed
Yeah, I know how to count it
I can count with my eyes closed
Gotta see you bounce it, so bounce with the lights on
It's you that my eyes on
I can count with my eyes closed
You see I'm in my zone
See you a hoe through a blindfold
I'm serious 'bout jewelry, my nigga
We know that them rhinestones
You know this shit diamond
Gettin' this money you count it
I can count with my eyes closed
I can hold it and know it

[Verse 1]
No coke on my nose
Got coke on my floor
My bro's get a drug charge
We ain't paranoid
We know they gon' doubt us
So we show up with dice on
She know that I get it, I got it (ooh)
You see this shit I'm on?

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you know how to count it?
Can you count with your eyes closed?
One eye like cyclops
Keep your eye on the rifle
Keep your hand on the Bible
I know that he watching, he know that I'm sinnin', he gimme no options
Just look at my watch, you can tell that I'm clockin' (woo)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know how to count it
I can count with my eyes closed

Gettin' this money you count it

[Verse 2]
Now pour up the Moet
Go slow when you pour it
We was poor
Now take this money and blow it
She can't sleep without it
She lay with her eyes open
She rub with her thighs open
But I'm late at the condo
Can't leave 'til I count it
I count with my eyes closed
Money talk, but it sing to me
All it hit is high notes
All I got is hunnids
Recycle, recycle
More paper, more paper (shit)
Gettin' richer like Lionel
Fiesta, fiesta
I got rhythm like Lionel
Do you know how to count it?
You know your times tables?
My chain when they make an announcement
Sayin' I'm out here
I know that you see me
If you could, you'd be me (cyeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you know how to count it?
Can you count with your eyes closed?
One eye like cyclops
Keep your eye on the rifle
Keep your hand on the Bible
I know that he watchin'
He know that I'm sinnin', he gimme no options
I took off the top now back to the topic

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know how to count it
I can count with my eyes closed
Yeah, I know how to count it
I can count with my eyes closed
Gotta see you bounce it, so bounce with the lights on
It's you that my eyes on
I can count with my eyes closed
You see I'm in my zone

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Maroon 5
It's Gucci

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane & Adam Levine]
Baby, why you turn so cold on me? (Brr)
All the things that you said took a toll on me
Told me you would take the charge but you told on me
I thought that you rock with me but you rolled on me
How my best friend turn into my enemy?
I really love you, girl, but I don't need the energy
You broke my heart, girl and I can't find the remedy
Now me and you can't even be in the same vicinity
Your friends interferin', they should throw a penalty
And you can't see it but them bitches full of jealousy
You played yourself, you had the baller of the century
Baby, tell me how did you get so cold

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Are we taking time, or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me

[Refrain: Adam Levine]
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Future]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 3: Future & Adam Levine]
Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off, and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna' cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay in our league
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four-letter word
But the four-letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, girl, where your heart used to be
You gold-dig every day
I switched the four-door to the two-door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space
Baby, tell me how did you get so cold

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Future]
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold
Wake up with somebody near you
And at someone else's place
You took acid and looked in the mirror
Watched the beard crawl around on your face
Oh, the revolution was here
That would set you free from those bourgeoisie
In the morning everything's clearer
When the sunlight exposes your age

But that's okay
And that's okay

Grab your clothes and head to the doorway
If you dance out, no one complains
Find the place where you can be boring
Where you won't need to explain
That you're sick in the head and you wish you were dead
Or at least instead of sleeping here you prefer your own bed, come on
You just suck at self-preservation
Versus someone else's pain
So you feel drained
And insane
And insane

He was leather and you were screaming
Swinging chains against the stage
And you couldn't know he was leaving
But now more will go with age, you know
So get up and stop your complaining
You know that you're the only one who's been destroying all the fun
Look what happened when you were dreaming
Then punch yourself in the face
So you kiss and you clutch but you can't fight that feeling
That your one true love is just awaiting your big meeting
So you never even asked for names
You just look right through them as if you already came
It's a drug of the heart and you can't stop the shaking
'Cause the body wants what it's terrible at taking, oh
And you can't remember the meaning
But there's no going back against this California feeling

Dream
(sha-bang, sha-bang)
American dream
(sha-bang, sha-bang)
American dream
(sha-bang, sha-bang)
American dream

Sport star
If you want me, I'll call
If you want me to fall
I'll fall
My dream
Let me play on your team
I'm clean
Let me tie your Nike's
Holding on for sport star
Let me wear your jersey
If you want to hurt me
Hurt me

I play how I wanna play
I say what I wanna say
I play how I wanna play
I say what I wanna say
I play how I wanna play
I say what I wanna say
I play how I wanna play
I say what I wanna say
Sport star
In the back of my car
Could you hit me too hard?
You're scarred
Sport star
I can hear your echo
Pass go
Driving on my white throne
95 to sport star
If I make it back on
I don't wanna live long
Just strong
We all, we all, we all, we all know this is nothing
We all, we all, we all, we all know this is nothing
We all, we all, we all, we all know this is nothing
This is nowhere
We all, we all, we all, we all know this is nowhere
There is no one
Here

It moves like a virus and enters our skin
The first sign divides us, the second is moving to Berlin
But that's not the state I'm in
The air is thin but that's not the state

The old guys are frightened and frightening to behold
The kids come out fighting and still doing what they're told
But you're waking a monster that will drive you from your hoary holes of gold
And your body will get cold

And we don't waste time with love
It's just death from above
Your head is on fire, your hands are getting weak
We all, we all get stupid in the heat
You've basted your brains with the shatter and the speed and defeat up on the street
And this is nowhere

The early years were boring
The quiet, unhappy punk
See mother was a cripple and my father was a drunk but gentle man
So we do the best we can

This is the plan
Wear your makeup like a man

'Cause we don't waste time with love
Yeah, we don't waste time with love
It's just a push and a shove

Well, there's a full-blown rebellion but you're easy to confuse
By trigger kids and fakers and some questionable views
Oh, call the cops, call the preachers!
Before they let us and they lose

When oh, we all start arguing the history of the Jews
You got nothing left to lose
Gives me the blues
And we don't waste time with love
And we don't waste time with love

So call the police
Yeah, call the police
Yeah, call the police
Yeah, call the police
Go, call the police
Go, call the police
Just text the cops
Yeah, call the police
You're crazy, man
Yeah, call 'em up
Just call the police
The first in line
They're gonna eat the rich
She, she
She, she

She cut a hole in the fence and she ran
She left her troublesome prison behind
She didn't wanna fuel the fire
She didn't wanna lose her desire

She, she
She, she

She looked out out to the horizon
She didn't have much left to see
Greed had taken the trees away
Greed had taken the bees away

She, she
She, she

She don't know where she gonna go now
She looked up to where there should've been stars
She said I wanna go to Mars
And this, this planet ain't ours
She said I wanna go to Mars
And this, this planet ain't ours
Ours
Ours

[Intro]
Uh, uh
'96 catalog
Uh, check it
Get money, uh

[Verse 1]
How you figure that your team can affect my cream?
Gold and platinum plaques since I stepped on the scene
Know what I mean? Peep the scene, Jacuzzi full of women
She hitting me and him and him, much love like Wimbledon
While niggas screaming 'killer', I'm overseas in my villa
With my masseuse, nothin' illa
Frank switch the plan, cop the Lexus Land
C-Gutta, Roc-A-Fella 400's and better
Lil' Cease push threes with fives in his eyes
Knocking 'Not Gon Cry' by Mary Blige
I die for my niggas packing steel, chickenheads with sex appeal
Reveal sexual acts up in Capone's Ac'
The chocolate dimes watch the M.A.F.I.A. shine
Girls, bring your own, can't touch a dime of mine!

[Interlude]
Know what I'm saying? Know what I'm saying dog?
Know what I'm saying dog?
Niggas, niggas, niggas on the beat
They don't even be knowing like, how we be rolling
You know what I'm saying? Like
We be like a big roller, group on you know what I'm saying?
The bananas is gone! The bananas is missing, dog!

[Verse 2]
A lime to a lemon, my D.C. women
Bringing in coke and heroin to condos with elevators in them
Vehicles with televisions in them
Watch their entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly 9's and MAC's
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can niggas stand there and say I sound like them? Hello
Push wigs back and push 6 coupes that's yellow
Bust clips that extend from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any telly you're in
Crack bagging, sick of bragging of how my mink be dragging
Desert E's street sweepers inside the Beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're fucking with the Devil

[Outro]
You know you're fucking with the devil right?
Straight up dog
Nigga talking all that bullshit, nigga trying to sell some motherfucking records
Nigga's a pussy, man. Straight up, man, he's a fake
"Jealous" by Nick Jonas:

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I turn my chin music up
And I'm puffing my chest
I'm turning red in the face
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
I mean no disrespect
It's my right to be hellish
I still get jealous

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why), I still get jealous
'Cause you're too sexy beautiful (Beautiful)
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (That's why), I still get jealous

"Cake By the Ocean" by DNCE:

[Verse: Joe Jonas]
Oh, no
See you walking 'round like it's a funeral
Not so serious girl, why those feet cold?
We just getting started, don't you tiptoe, tiptoe

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas]
Waste time with a masterpiece
Don't waste time with a masterpiece
You should be rollin' me, you should be rollin' me
You're a real-life fantasy, you're a real-life fantasy
But you're movin' so carefully, let's start livin' dangerously

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas, Joe Jonas]
Talk to me, baby (Come on)

I think I love her (hey, hey, hey)
..met a girl name Susie, I let her join my...
..met a girl name Susie, I let her join my...
Well, my name is Susie and Gucci think I love him
Well, my name is Susie and Gucci think I love him

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
It ain't no love in this city
Shit this industry so finicky
I rather fuck a stripper to be loved
And I'm thuggin' in the club
In the hood, in the mall, anywhere
I do not want to be loved
It's too emotional, it's business never personal
I coulda went commercial but that's not what I does
You need a hug lil' nigga
You a scrub lil' nigga
I'm a shooter, I do not want to be loved

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]

[?] reminded, you've been blinded
Looking for a squad like mine you can't find it
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, jay
Bricksquad records go hard in the paint
Got my shirt just like Wooh Da Kid
Ain't nothing changed, Bricksquad the shit
Came out reppin' straight drop
I signed myself, now Gucci rich
Heavy gonja rolling bricks, 200K on promotion
Funny thing about it, did it all in just one weekend
Homie want to be a soulja but the books are closing
I'm D'd up in my office, hit the button curtains open
So you can keep your love baby, bust that pussy open
Cause I'm the king of diamonds, East Atlanta, I'm the spokesman
I'm boastin', takin' pictures posin'
Smoking like a locomotive
This man serve since Souuth Dakota
Touch down with 100 soldiers
Taking cola, taking over, should be in a rockin' roller
Hall of fame, is Gucci Mane, my chain is colder bipolar

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
It ain't no love in this city
Shit this industry so finicky
I rather fuck a stripper to be loved
And I'm thuggin' in the club

It's too emotional, it's business never personal
I coulda went commercial but that's not what I does
You need a hug lil' nigga
You a scrub lil' nigga
I'm a shooter, I do not want to be loved

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane & Ester Dean]
These hoes don't love me
There tryna fool me
You cannot trick me, yellow my time piece
Gucci Mane, I love you, I really love me
That's why I'm buying diamonds, my flow is that sweet
Gucci Mane is so street, I love South Beach
Shout out to Wyclef, I love Haiti
Shout out to Bun B, we miss Pimp C
I love 8 Ball & MJG, fuck niggas hate me
Fuck with 

[?] the long way, big ups to Master P
These lames ain't gotta like me or come and hug me
White girl with me, snortin' off her car keys
You don't love me, nigga you don't love me (I think I love her)
I'm back bitch, yeah I'm back bitch
Did you miss me or miss my raps bitch
I'm writing history I'm writing history
You niggas OV, yeah ain't you history
(It's Gucci)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
It ain't no love in this city
Shit this industry so finicky
I rather fuck a stripper to be loved
And I'm thuggin' in the club
In the hood, in the mall, anywhere
I do not want to be loved
It's too emotional, it's business never personal
I coulda went commercial but that's not what I does
You need a hug lil' nigga
You a scrub lil' nigga
I'm a shooter, I do not want to be loved

[Intro]
Light my body up

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I feel like we going under
Take me down
I can't help but wonder
You got everything I want and
If you keep on talking
I'ma put it where you want it
Keep up, ain't no need to slow it down
We could get it poppin'
You could love me, love me downtown
You got everything I want now
Let me fill your fantasies
And give you what you dream 'bout

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fill the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Stakes are higher than a mother
What you wanna bet that you'll never find another?
Like me, I'm once in a lifetime
Only get all of me once in your lifetime
I'll leave you drowning in your wet dream
Swimming in that love
Surf it up in your wet dream
Baby, let me blow your cover
Come on, make me wish I was your part time lover

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fill the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down (burnin' me, burning me)
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fill the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
What is a gangsta if he ain't strapped?
And what is a gangsta if he can't scrap?
And what is a gangsta if he can't mack?
Well I can do it all baby, just like that
The grass is greener on the side I live on
Doggy Dogg went soft, motherfucker you did wrong
But why he on peace, If he was a beast he would've took off on the south Midwest and the east?
Chill, y'all niggas don't get it, and you'll probably never will
It's hard to be real
But it's easy to kill, that's probably why I keep my game on the top of the hill
They keep my name on the top of the bill while y'all lost out there, poppin' them pills
You could've been with Snoop Dogg, rockin' the bill, hop in the veele
For real, I'm out clockin' the meal

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a east side nigga on these west side streets
In my G boy stance with my hands on my dick
We the best thing goin', got the champagne pourin'
And we put it down, come and do the damn thing goin'
I'm a self-made millionaire, the boss Big Snoop
Everything I touch I turn to big loot
This the ZU gang and we ride with Snoop
All I know is that I make that shit do what it do

[Verse 2]
It's the early Berg, it's the grandest anthem
Good day LA, it's time to get back at 'em
Yea, the west coast renaissance
You could smell it in the air, feel the ambiance
And on the road to riches and fancy things
To get a little recognition, be the major bling
Get the ole 6 range, house on the hill, 40 acres in the dollar dollar bill
Big heads in my pocket, hoes in the VI
Mad dough I stack, get scratched like a feline
Sip on the bottle mack, lick on the matua
Break it down, twist 'em up like Chicago rock
To the club, hop off, new Jays
Fitted to the back like 7 and 5-8's
I'm all fly with a fly date
I'm here to boogie, don't make me add to the crime rate

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a east side nigga on these west side streets
In my G boy stance with my hands on my dick
We the best thing goin', got the champagne pourin'
And we put it down, come and do the damn thing goin'
I'm a self-made millionaire, the boss Big Snoop
Everything I touch I turn to big loot
This the ZU gang and we ride with Snoop
All I know is that I make that shit do what it do

[Verse 3]
Hoes on my nuts like screws and bolts
Fuck bein' a playa, I'm tryin' to coach
I will pick advantage if you'll let me
Have you driblin' balls like Lisa Leslie, test me
I'm goin' release the heat again
You floatin' in the ocean like Lacy Peterson
Run, cuz you don't want confrontation
Masturbate, you're just masturbatin' bitch

Ey mack we blim big
Can't be mad at young Einstein, acceleratin' the game

Nigga I gotta get mine
Lee, I'mma get mine too
Slide through with the candy paint
Light tint
Like ZU. You don't know the outcome
Got the whole game locked up like Akon

We purple urkle, filet mignon
We're hittin' everything that we aimin' on

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a east side nigga on these west side streets
In my G boy stance with my hands on my dick
We the best thing goin', got the champagne pourin'
And we put it down, come and do the damn thing goin'
I'm a self-made millionaire, the boss Big Snoop
Everything I touch I turn to big loot
This the ZU gang and we ride with Snoop
All I know is that I make that shit do what it do

My mode is 'Geeked up' call it dabbin' (shwoo)
I'm poppin' that bih like an Aspirin (poppin' that bih like)
I'm popping these perks like they Aspirins (poppin' 'em)
When you think I'm gay, think of caskets
Damn, I had to cry first 'cause I'm laughing (haa)
Put that dough on your purses (hee, hee)
Got it snowing on purpose (yeah, racks)
The big day was a Saturday (what, what?)
Throw that dough on a Thursday
Half a million in pesos (half)
We gon' throw up some birds (brr, brr)
Hunnid thou' for the necklace (hunnid thou')
Take the charm and it's worth it
212, well talk to me
Big Bs like a bumblebee
Two twenty five on the stingray (skeet)
If you know biology (yeah)
Cheese on my head, I'm Green Bay (cheese)
R.I.P Chalicee
I let her have fun, and I let her play
But she my main bitch biologically (Thugger)

[Chorus]
I laugh at bitches that done played me
Oh my God, baby, baby (yee, yee)
You nothing, nothing, boy you crazy (you)
Ain't no "I owe you," owe you nothin' (cost)
No lean on the kid, bitch, I paid ya

Sake of my kids (yeah), I promise (swear)
We on, we never stoppin'
Hop on, come on, woahhh
Jump on, wet like the shore, oh my Lord (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Bitch it's hammer time (hammer)
All these hoes so fine (yee)
She gon' close her eyes (what?)
I don't want that, oh, I
Said that I must was high (dope)
I took a Vicodin like ten minutes ago
But prior... to that, I was higher than a flier
Hop on a private and catch up, where's all my sleep?
I don't want nut in your face, I want in them titties
You want my signature, them numbers must increase
Put so many hoes in the car, I can smell disease (brr, brr, brr, brr)
I'm a king like Diddy (brr)
Get fresh, I'm ROCin' like JAY-Z (brr, woah)
My shoes, so clean, I'm ballin', I'm ballin' like KD (oh)
No beanie, no weenies (oh, my Lord)
I told her like

[Chorus]
I laugh at bitches that done played me
Oh my God, baby, baby (yee, yee)

[Outro]
Brr, brr, brr
Brr, brr, brr
Brr, brr
Ooh, ohh
Ohh
Brr, brr, ohh
Brr, brr, brr
Brr, brr

[Verse 1]
Had a dream it was on my ceiling
I had a feeling it was in my head
If I walk outside every time it's freezing
I have to wonder if it wants me dead again

[Chorus]
It's not something I can run my hands over
It's not something I can run my hands over
It's not something I can run my hands over
It's not something I can run my hands over

[Verse 2]
I'm not afraid to walk without a way
And if I close my eyes, I'm scared I'll never get to leave the grey
I wanna sleep and never leave my bed
And then I won't hesitate to call it my friend again

[Chorus]
It's not something I can run my hands over
It's not something I can run my hands over
It's not something I can run my hands over
It's not something I can run my hands over

[Outro]
Oh, never sleep again
Oh, never sleep again

[Verse 1]
Shutters on my house keeps the sunlight in
If that's not enough to keep the people out
Then I don't wanna know what's on the other side

[Verse 2]
Turn on the TV, I wonder who thinks of it all
We could be watching the same thing
But I always shock myself when I plug it into the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
So should I ask?
Are you home?

[Chorus]
I can't keep anything down
All I hear is static buzz
And it's all echoing through my bedroom wall

[Verse 3]
Cover me in flies
They're breaking through the door
That'll show the garbage man
What everyone else is always so bitter for

[Pre-Chorus]
So should I ask?
Are you home?

[Chorus]
I can't keep anything down
All I hear is static buzz
And it's all echoing through my bedroom wall

[Outro]
Shutters on my house keeps the sunlight in
If that's not enough to keep the people out
Then I don't wanna know what's on the other side
The other side
The other side
The other side

[Verse 1]
I've been down countless halls
And once you've seen one, it's like you've seen 'em all
And I've seen two open doors
And I can't help but wonder what the second is for

[Chorus]
And I can't tell myself anything
Even when it feels so seamless
And even when it feels so seamless
Don't get caught in the dirt, the dirt

[Verse 2]
There's a weight and I feel it and it's pressing down
And it won't be for nothing and it won't stick around
If it is about anything that I can fix
Then I'll see you on the other side if it really exists

[Chorus]
And I can't tell myself anything
Even when it feels so seamless
But even when it feels so seamless
Don't get caught in the dirt, the dirt

[Bridge]
No more clean air, it burns my lungs
No more second guesses, I've had enough
No more clean air, it burns my lungs
No more second guesses, I've had enough

[Outro]
Let's forget it now
Baby, when I'm 30, I'll laugh about how dumb it felt
Baby, when I'm 30, I'll laugh it out
And oh god, it's not funny, it's not funny, it's not funny
But I know we can laugh it out

[Verse 1]
Oh garden slug
What would you give to live like one of us?
Or would you rather wait in the shade?
Just the same as every day
Oh useless thing
What does another useless day bring?
Did you just lie in place?
Emulated by the way I lie awake

[Chorus]
And in the waves I could've sworn that I saw my own reflection
And it was someone else's in the back
I could've waited my whole life to
Know the difference
But I should've just known better than that

[Verse 2]
And oh, is it easiest to hide
Under covered rocks
Or would you rather cut it all down
Just to keep it from dragging you around?

[Chorus]
And in the waves I could've sworn that I saw my own reflection
And it was someone else's in the back
I could've waited my whole life to
Know the difference
But I should've just known better than that

[Outro]
So if you look death right in the face, don't thank him
'Cause there's nothing and there won't ever be
And in moss covered springs you'd never find anything
So what's the use in hiding under our feet?

[Verse 1]
Do you dream about the people that wrong you?
Do you see those faces again and again?
And what holy thing has come to possess you?
And does it all blend together in your head?

[Chorus]
And did things work out for you?
Or are you still not sure what that means?
And it's a hard trip to the kitchen sink
'Cause I can't wash this one clean, clean

[Verse 2]
Did you tell all of your friends?
Did you tell all of your friends?
Maybe I could understand
What is it about them?
Would they stick around?
What is it with them?
And would they stick around?

[Verse 3]
Up late for six nights in a row
Figures in the dark, oh, they move so slow
Sleep with the lights on in the hall
And you'd leave the door open
It won't mean a thing at all

[Chorus]
And did things work out for you?
Or are you still not sure what that means?
And it's a hard trip to the kitchen sink
'Cause I can't wash this one clean

[Post-Chorus]
Did you tell all of your friends?
Did you tell all of your friends?
And baby, I could understand
What is it about them?
Would they stick around?
And what is it with them?
And would they stick around?
Would they stick around?
Would they stick around?

[Outro]
And it doesn't matter
They're up and they're down
And I'll bet
They're at home
And I wouldn't worry
Who's happy alone
Even when it doesn't make sense
Yeah, what's happenin' partner? Ayy, look man, this TIP. What I need you to do is, right now, man, I think you should—I think you oughta put that Hustle Gang on. Yeah, you heard me partner. I said Hustle Gang. Yours truly, T.I.P K.I.N.G period. Also known as Trouble Man, featuring my two player partners, Chip, repping the UK to the fullest, and Iggy. Igga-monster, get at 'em
Thought of something in the moonlight
What do you think it was?

Thought of something in the moonlight
Forgot it by the morning sun

Whispering the sweeter nothings, feel you high above. Now I'm your love

Tell me why you think I love you, and I'll tell you if your right. Told you all my darkest secret, but I think I lied

Whispering the sweeter nothings, feel you high above. Now I'm your love

Will I ever find your love? Tell me before the break of day
I was passing down your fair, latenight moonlight fades away
Latenight moonlight fades away
Latenight moonlight fades away
I was wandering in the rain (Mask of life, feelin' insane)
Swift and sudden fall from grace (Sunny days seem far away)
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me (Stalin's tomb won't let me be)
On and on and on it came

How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?

How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

Here abandoned in my fame (Armageddon of the brain)
KGB was doggin' me (Take my name and just let me be)
Then a begger boy called my name (Happy days will drown the pain)
On and on and on it came
How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?

Like a stranger in Moscow
Like a stranger in Moscow
Like a stranger in Moscow

How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
Hold on and I’ll think you'll like the day
Cross your heart and hope to fade away
If I was the earth, you’d be the sun, no
You’d be the entire milky way;

Deep into the monsters eye
Dancing round the Daddy's thin line
We could go frolic in the meadows
We could go swimming in the serpentine

Hold on you told me you had no
This side of you never show
I wouldn’t of wasted all this time
And I’d have you all to my own

Deep into the monsters eye
Dancing round the Daddy's thin line
We could go frolic in the meadows
We could go swimming in the serpentine

Oh, this feeling I’ve felt before
One of the visions you cannot ignore
I dunno what this feeling is for
I feel the love from you
She said it’s kinda like a dream
And I said well honey I have to agree
She said my woes flow like a river
And I said they flow more the sea
I hope that you are the one
If not, you are the prototype
We'll tiptoe to the sun

And do things I know you like

I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again

Today, today must be my lucky day
Baby, you are the prototype
Do sumn' outta the ordinary
Like catch a matinee
Baby, you are the prototype
I think I'm...

I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again

If we happen to part
Lord knows I don't want that
But hey, we can't be mad at God
We met today for a reason
I think I'm on the right track now
I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again

Let's go, let's go to the movies

(And... action!)

I think I'm in love again...

Girl, right now I wanna say, I wanna say
I wanna say stank you (stank you) very much (very much)
For picking me up
And bringing me back to this world

I can't or not, I can't afford to not record
I think I wanna say
I think I wanna say stank you
Stank you smelly much
For picking me up and bringing me back to this world

Stank you very much...

Hey, hey John
Are we recording our ad libs?
Really, what we were recording just there?
Let me hear that that first one
You are my angel
Come from way above
To bring me love


Her eyes
She's on the dark side
Neutralize
Every man in sight

To love you, love you, love you...

You are my angel
Come from way above

To love you, love you, love you...

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Are we taking time, or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
If you wanna leave, just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Verse 3: Future & Adam Levine]
Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off, and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna' cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna' stay, and I leave
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four letter word
But the four letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You got a gold bar where your heart used to be
You gold dig every day
I switched the four door to the two door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space
Baby, tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Intro]
I had to get out of Hollywood
Get back to the trenches, they said they need me
Lil' fish

[Verse 1]
I used to cop my little reggie tryna feed myself
My cousin had that work but I didn't need no help
Man I was so fucked up I couldn't believe myself
That's why I be at the jeweler tryna freeze myself
'Cause my heart so cold, we ain't got no goals
All these young niggas killin' like they ain't got no souls
Talkin' Grand Marquis, before I cop my Rolls
It was all so sweet until Dashawn told
Really hurt my heart, ripped my feelings apart
Out in Philly it's dark, we was really so scarred
But actin' silly so hard but we just wanted some love
Mama workin', daddy dead, I just wanted a hug
Why you think we spillin' spade when we go to the club
All my homies think I smoke, we just rollin' it up
I'm stressed out, niggas got Jordans, feel left out
So I went to chasin' them birdies, I went south, fuck it

[Chorus]
I went from goin' to school, to totin' them tools and makin' the moves
I said I would win, they said I would lose, shit
We're so confused, hope I don't make the news, oh Lord
We was breakin' the rules, trappin' to get some food
Risking freedom for shoes
Knowin' that I don't need 'em, I'm spending money on jewels
Jeweler like, "He's a fool"
They told us that this was cool

[Verse 2]
Uh
Caught my first case, it was me versus the state
I just wanted some steak and some food on my plate
Came up from shit I'm like "how can you hate?"
I'm just tryna be great!
I survived with the snakes
Look what they did to Lil Kodak and Gates'
I can't lose faith, I just want shine like the stars in my wraith
We go to war in fatigues like it's bape
I don't feel safe, can't sleep without it
Master with them P's yeah boy I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Brought me to my knees back when everybody doubted
Can't let my youngins see me fold, I'm too solid
If I stand on it, I'ma stand on it
Put some bags on the scale, put some grams on it
This the only shit I knew I seen my man done it
Tryna be like niggas who were never there for us
We ain't have no guidance

[Chorus]
I went from goin' to school, to totin' them tools and makin the moves
I said I would win, they said I would lose, shit
We're so confused, hope I don't make the news, oh Lord
We was breakin' the rules, trappin' to get some food
Risking freedom for shoes
Knowin' that I don't need 'em, I'm spending money on jewels
Jeweler like, "He's a fool"
They told us that this was cool

[Verse 3]
Coppers scoopin' niggas out their radar
Niggas puttin' niggas in the graveyard
Jobs told us beat it like an A&R
So we play with heart, fuck it we gon' play it raw
Cut the lights, told my momma they ain't stayin' off
They killed my daddy and it turned me to a man, dog
We play with Rugers, play with Glocks, we ain't playin' ball
Shit we tryna stay alive it's a standoff
My life for your life
Go to war like we got like four lives
Talkin' before like, all this lil' rap shit
Where I'm from if you turn eighteen, then that's More Life
For real nigga

[Interlude]
When you have no voice
Ain't nobody hear us, so we ain't have no choice

[Chorus]
I went from goin' to school, to totin' them tools and makin' the moves
I said I would win, they said I would lose, shit
We're so confused, hope I don't make the news, oh Lord
We was breakin' the rules, trappin' to get some food
Risking freedom for shoes
Knowin' that I don't need 'em, I'm spending money on jewels
Jeweler like, "He's a fool"
They told us that this was cool

[Intro]
That be Maaly Raw
(M-m-m-murda)

[Hook: Young Thug]
Hey, 200 miles on the dashboard (skrt-skrt-skrt)
I came from serving them bags out a back-porch
(Serving them bags out a back-porch)
We hit that boy with a stick cause he asked for it
(Hit that boy with a stick)
Residue, I threw that brick off a backboard
(I threw that brick off a backboard)
80k on, it's a backend, backend
I hit that lil boy with a Mac-10, Mac-10
I spent like four racks on a jacket, fashion
I fuck that ho with a passion, I'm everlasting

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I am a leader, (boss)
Never a follower (never a follower, whoo)
You a dick eater, your girl's a swallower (she official my nigga)
No I won't hit her, she not in my caliber (wouldn't even hit that thot)
We've been stunting a long time, I know that they tired of us (niggas is sick, woah)
I ain't around no fuck boy
Glock four pound in the tuck boy
Big D's on truck boy (skrt-skrt)
All my young niggas sell boy (young nigga)
Young boy going like Elroy (yeah)
Big booty back in the Goyard (Goyard)
Spend the whole thing in Bergdorf

Flood my Patek
Young boy still getting at it (at it)
21 shots my FN (brrrr)
Young rich nigga living savage (savage)
You in the hood, gotta check in
We the side never need passes (no)
These fuck boys so swagless, 4500 my jacket, fashion

[Hook: Young Thug]
Hey, 200 miles on the dashboard (skrt-skrt-skrt)
I came from serving them bags out a back-porch
(Serving them bags out a back-porch)
We hit that boy with a stick cause he asked for it
(Hit that boy with a stick)
Residue, I threw that brick off a backboard
(I through that brick off a backboard)
80k on, it's a backend, backend
I hit that lil boy with a Mac-10, Mac-10
I spent like 4 racks on a jacket, fashion
I fuck that ho with a passion, I'm everlasting

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Your bitch'll call me Mr. Big
My house a year old like a kid
We murk 'em then we dodge the pigs
Put a dirt bike on your wig
Could be court side with your bitch (skrt)
Could be worldwide, I'm a trend (woah)
Make her snort a line like a pin (snh)
Nigga diamonds jumping out the gym
Take it all off, take it all off with your friends, ay
Play with my dogs, then we going off with your head, yeah
The Percocets on me, a young nigga take a lot of meds
I pop me a thirty now I walk around like I'm dead (dead man walking)
I'm high as the law, I'm lit like July the 4th
Double R seats they tight, but a pussy nigga really soft (soft)
I'ma take off on sight (takeoff), run a nigga down like Moss
I got me a Draco on the flight, I came out the creek like Dawson

[Hook: Young Thug]
Hey, 200 miles on the dashboard (skrt-skrt-skrt)
I came from serving them bags out a back-porch
(Serving them bags out a back-porch)
We hit that boy with a stick cause he asked for it

80k on, it's a backend, backend
I hit that lil boy with a Mac-10, Mac-10
I spent like 4 racks on a jacket, fashion

[Outro: Meek Mill]
Swerving, swerving, swerving, swerving
Basic bitches make me nervous
I'm so high, ain't got no service
Fuck a fuckboy bitch on purpose
Swerving, swerving, swerving, swerving
Bust a brick down, bag and serve it
We gon' take this shit the furthest
Play with me and shit get murdered (brrp-brrp)

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah
Chasing
Chasing that bag, chasing that bag
Chasing
Whoo
Aye
Lil' fish

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Woke up this morning I had a ménage
Loaded the foreigns I packed the garage
We do it big like we back in the Stuy
Maybe I’ll sell if I rap and I lie
Maybe I'll sell if I let niggas write it
These niggas swagger jacking and they buyin'
This for my niggas trappin' out them Hondas
Tryna get designer, Gucci they attire
Walk in this building, it's quiet
I break a heart then I buy it
I probably get her a Birkin
I take that back, shit I'm lying
I'm on the jet when I'm flying
I'm in the Bentley, I'm wheelin'
I'm in the trench with my niggas and I know the feeling to see 20 million
Funny money niggas counterfeit
I could tell you ain't been around the shit
Like a swiper, when I got the black card
80 up in Barneys if I count the fit
Seen the money, and I know the sound of it
It go (vrrrt vrrrt!)
That's a lot of it
Know that language that money machine clicking
They been rap dissing, I ain't seen, niggas
Know Omelly ready, I got Dean with us
And that 7 on me, I got Leem with us
Like that dirty dirty, how I lean niggas
And wrist on subzero like freeze nigga
Finish them niggas, yeah I put an end to them niggas
I'm on the roof with that scope
When I hit them little bitches like Remy my nigga

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
You save 'em, we slay 'em
Girl I ball

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Whip whip whip, whip it
Me and your bitch in a Bentley
Making it rain when she strippin'
Hold up the umbrella like Bentley
Fuck with a nigga that's righteous
Call me Mr. East Coast I'm the tightest
I remember when bedbugs was biting
God bless me like a nigga got sinus
Ooh, Holy Ghost, I'm a baptist
Fucking them ratchets
Might get a Met Gala actress
Who give me the top when I slap it
Feeling like DJ Khaled
She grindin' on my dick getting careless
Man I had to kill this beat, I'm a savage
Meek Milly top 20 on the atlas

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Back in this bitch and you know we reloaded
Look at the credits and tell you who wrote it
I had that bitch on my dick and she rode it
And she wouldn't speak to you niggas and you know it
I'm out in Cali I'm looking for Khloe
Kylie and Kourtney or maybe a Kendall, finesse with that swagger
You know I'ma swindle you niggas don't get into shit that I'm into
Shit that I'm saying will prolly offend you
You acting rowdy like Bobby was with you
You only talk when that molly up in you
Man, you'll figure out when that tommy'll hit you
Got bad bitches in the A, down in MIA, talking in the bay
When I'm on the west, we ain't giving fades
Cause I got the cake, Draco with the laser on it
I hit her page, I'm on it
I like her pictures for warning
DM that bitch for the kill
She answer back, I'ma swarm it
Probably all be in Florida
I put your bitch in that cool water
Say I remind her of 2Pac
32 shots in my oowop
She fuck me good, get a new Benz
She keep it tricking a new shop
Went to Miami on Monday
By Tuesday I heard that them dudes shot
I do not know about situations
'Cause I never ever talk to cops
I will not speak if you made a statement
Cause I know the do's and the do not's

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
You save ‘em, we slay 'em
Girl I ball

[Outro: Takbar]
Look at the ride it’s filthy
Look at that shit man
Earlier I was just standing there looking at this shit
Like god damn
There’s really a Wraith, a Bentley, a Bentley, a Maybach and a bullet proof car
This the shit i really be on you know what I'm saying
It’s the life
Im really happy around like
This is real shit

[Hook: Snoop Dogg (& Ice Cube)]
Uh, L.A. (yay yay!), Californi-i-a (Yay yay!)

Uh, L.A. (L.A.) , Californi-i-a (Californi-i-a)
City of ballers, Inglewood, we love it!

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Live from L.A., this way that-a-way
Slide in the hid-house, feeling burned did-out
Kick of your shoes and relax your feet
And party on down to this DJ Quik beat
The beat that gets you up and gets you outta your seat
Flip your BET on kick back and get your 'G' on
We on some west coast get those to the liquor store
Sippin' on some Rémy Martin before the show get started
It's gon' be off the hanger, and a few cool rap singers
I can't believe it, my boy got a show now
Bow wow, let's hit the corner in my four now
Long Beach style, make your woman wanna smile
And all guests on the show gonna bust a freestyle
Suggestin' questions and confessions
We havin' a good time on that BET live session
Let's move out to Swap Meet or Rodeo Drive
Or just post up by the Hollywood sign
We throwin' BBQ so life a grill
All my dawgs invited so y'all come on a chill
You at the beach or at the park or
Shootin' a 

[?] or at the park
Doin' it after dark
You heard me? Doin' it after dark

[Hook: Snoop Dogg (& Xzibit)]
Uh, L.A. (Los Angeles) , Californi-i-a (California)

Uh, L.A. (Los Angeles) , Californi-i-a (California)
City of ballers, Hollywood, we love it!

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
I gotta call it hot shit now
Most people mistake havin' money for havin' style
We actin' wild up in the streets without a second thought
It's about gettin' away and gettin' caught
It's written thought, matter a fact in the form of X
I came to take everything except a final breath
I'm rock and rollin' coast to ya left side
After sunset we shine on the westside
So let 'em know, Cube

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
You know I got Snoop Dogg at my arraignment
Start a riot for this black entertainment
L-7's gotta ask who I came with, Xzibit
You midget, we don't rap it, we live it
Take it if you don't give it
BET is my digits, baby
So won't you come here, cause we can play all day
Live from LA, that's where the party people stay, yay yay
And we can do it like this, unless you flippin' on that
All black, get the format, sunny day, top back
Double R, high beams on the black and white or widescreen
Run and tell ya family tree that they can see me on BET
Weekly, and if it looks like Cube is gettin too much sun
I'm comin' live from L.A. havin' too much fun
Yay yay!

[Hook: Snoop Dogg (& Ice Cube)]
Uh, L.A. (yay yay!), Californi-i-a (Yay yay!)

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fills the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You got something that I believe
I've been waiting for all my
We're blazing high, smoke fills the night
I'm gasoline, you're fire
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Light my body up
Light my body up

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Who shot ya? Separate the weak from the obsolete
Hard to creep them Brooklyn streets
It's on nigga, fuck all that bickering beef
I can hear sweat trickling down your cheek
Your heartbeat sound like Sasquatch feet
Thundering, shaking the concrete
Then the shit stop when I foil the plot
Neighbors call the cops, said they heard mad shots
Saw me in the drop, three and a quarter
Slaughter, electrical tape around your daughter
Old school/new school need to learn though
I burn, baby, burn like "Disco Inferno"
Burn slow like blunts with yayo
Peel more skins than Idaho Potato
Niggas know: the lyrical molesting is taking place
Fucking with Biggie Smalls, it ain't safe
I make your skin chafe, rashes on them asses
Bumps and bruises, blunts and Land Cruisers
Big Poppa smash fools, bash fools
Niggas mad because I know that cash rules
Everything around me two Glock 9s
Any motherfucker whispering about mines
And I'm Crooklyn's finest
Representing for the queen, her royal highness

[Verse 2: Keith Murray]
Catch this one bubonic plague
In your head, back, chest, arms, and legs
When I'm coming through grab your cranium for alternatum
Son, I stay subterranium
My subliminals mix with criminal chemicals
Got more milky syllables than alphabet cereal
Place your bet and your whole entourage will get wet
That's a promise 'cause Idon't make threats
I'm a graceful poet with sadistic ballistics
Above and beyond all that other bullshit
Linguistics aggressive antiseptic
Nerve-wreckin', concepted on consistent contestants
My deviant deliverance
Leaves MC's in a state of mal mid depressin' (Word up)
I launch flows like torpedos
At any god-given episode
I be destined to flip so much funk shit
And do niggas better than the government
Keith Murray wrecks this with various combinations
I'm sick, manifestation
Oh my god, it's the hardest, I make entourages
And crews see mirages, Mary J. Blige is
God, gotta have my crew lace me up now
I keep trying everything that I've got
Trying to be somebody, somebody that I'm not
I keep trying to find somebody that I know
So deep into the jungle we go

On your journey to the middle of nowhere
Feeling your loss comes right on cue
So are you waiting for insanity
Or is it sanity waiting for you?
I bet you're not that happy
Now it's run right out on you
I said hey, I gotta follow you girl
So into the jungle we go, oh yeah

I got evil in my veins, just to cause you pain
Don't get me through
You just smile, I will be right
And if I'm wrong
Then I'm testing you
I bet you're not that happy
That I won't run and hide
I said hey, you got all the angels
But the devils on my side, ah yeah
He is trying to fool you, girl
He is trying to fool you, girl
He is trying to

[Chorus: Joba]
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love you
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
I just wanna love you
Just wanna hold you, never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
What you waiting for?

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
It feels like I can see the past in your eyes
I know the future has been passing you by
These other niggas, they just passing your time
They don't know how to ride the tidal waves
That crash in your thighs
But I got the dream, and if you believe
Then I can take you somewhere that is pristine
I'm keeping it clean, my title is mean
They boxin' us in but we broke out the seams
Don't make me a fiend, I know what I want
I'm working to get everything that I need
But I got a plan for you
I'm taking a stand for you, I care for you

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
What's your motive with me, baby?
'Cause I don't trust nobody lately
I twist and turn, moving just like a serpent
New times are coming just like a virgin
Get you all outta my head, 'cause lately I'm better off dead
I say this all out of respect, sometimes, I want nothing with you
Wearing your love like medallions
'Cause I know thousand men want ya, wants the menages
Fucking, riding shotgun, slap your buns
Melting, fading, under stars and the sun
85, 90, gon' bust out the gun
Know they sent me from the neck of the woods
Change my name, state so they never could

[Chorus: Joba]
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love you
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
I just wanna love you
Just wanna hold you, never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
What you waiting for?

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
I need a friend (I need a friend)
And you need a home (You need a home)
I love when you come (I love when you coming)
I still feel alone
You make it warm in my bed
Butterflies in my head
Sunrise, let it set
But you don't love me like you say you do
White lies hold the hidden truth
You keep leaving when I need you most
It's true what they say about love had and love lost
Here you are and now you're gone
I'm left alone in the same bed, I wake up in a cold sweat

[Verse 4: Joba]
Please don't make me wait long
I just wanna be your main one
Your main, your main one, mm-mm
See, I don't want nobody, but you, mm-mm
See, I don't want nobody, but you, mm-mm
I spent the day by my lonesome
Who do you call when there's no one?
No one ever did what you did for me and did to me
My bed is cold and indented where you used to sleep
Tell me what you're waiting for, shit
Tell me what I'm here for

[Chorus: Joba]
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love you
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
I just wanna love you
Just wanna hold you, never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
What you waiting for?

[Verse 1: Mike & Chester]
I didn't think that I had a debt to pay
'Til they came to take what I had left away
You said you wouldn't put me to the test today
But I remember you saying that yesterday
There was a time when your mind wasn't out of control
Every memory and confession pouring out of your soul
Like a pill you couldn't swallow so it swallowed you whole
Another lie hard to follow, it followed you home
And like that

[Pre-Chorus: Chester & Mike]
Broken down
A victim of your pride
Fire so out of control
Every memory and confession pouring out of your soul
And like that
Broken down
A victim of your lies

[Chorus: Chester & Mike]
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You crossed the line
Wrapped up inside your lies
You hide behind lies
You're lost inside that cold disguise
Behind your lies

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I don't know what you thought I might say
Seems like we never would talk the right way
Every other minute I fought for my place
And drop what I made thought and you might stay so
I'm guessing that you probably know
When your inside's hollow then you ought to be cold
Like a pill hard to swallow, so it swallowed you whole
Another lie hard to follow, it followed you home
And like that

[Pre-Chorus: Chester & Mike]
Broken down
A victim of your lies

[Chorus: Chester & Mike]
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You crossed the line
Wrapped up inside your lies
You hide behind lies
You're lost inside that cold disguise
Behind your lies

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
You're faking, you're mistaken
If you think that you could climb out of this hole
Forsaken, what we take when
All our lies come from the power of control
Broken down, a victim of your
Faking, you're mistaken
If you think that you could climb out of this hole
Broken down, a victim of your lies

[Interlude: Chester & Mike]
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You hide behind
Wrapped up inside your lies

[Chorus: Chester & Mike]
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You crossed the line
Wrapped up inside your lies
You hide behind lies
You're lost inside that cold disguise
Behind your lies

[Intro]
Drumma Boy

[Verse 1]
Yeah, look, well it's that real shit, straight from Virginia
Down for my niggas I really ride
All of us got a semi cocked
Country nigga bought a yacht, Rolex the watch
Take the roof off that motherfucker just to shut down the block
Niggas starvin', look at my pockets, they fill up with knots
You mechanical, I will damage you, I'm somethin' you not
These bitches compliment my tendencies, tattoos and nose rings
This is how we ride on our enemies
Hate it, but you love it, out in public, you duckin'
My niggas got no regards for the repercussions
Promethazine and weed, they see the reaper comin'
I see 'em all lean, but I'm tryna teach 'em somethin'

[Chorus]
What they don't know (Yeah, uh)
It's just the life of a young nigga
That's what they don't know (Haha, that's just the life, yeah, yeah)
It's just the life of a young nigga
Roll up (Life), alright, yeah
Welcome to the life of a young nigga
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up), haha (Yeah, look, look)
This just the life of a— (Woo!)

[Verse 2]
No more days of me not gettin' paid, my paper straight
No more shade, hatin' on a nigga, I'm startin' to bake
Heatin' up, mama wasn't even make minimum wage
She get her on TV show, act Hollywood and L.A
I said, "Wassup mama? You doin' it, lookin' like a bad bitch
Talkin' hella records, remember when you ain't had shit?"
I guess you on now, let me fall back
Let you do you and calm down, let that pussy get worn out
The club feeling like high school
Everybody in cliques, bitches act like they like you
Niggas sucked the most dick, can I get in? What up, my nigga?
Only wanna see these bitches, won't you shut up, my nigga? Yikes!

[Chorus]
What they don't know (Yeah, uh)
It's just the life of a young nigga
That's what they don't know (Haha, that's just the life, yeah, yeah)
It's just the life of a young nigga
Roll up (Life), alright, yeah
Welcome to the life of a young nigga
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up), haha (Yeah, alright, look, look)
This just the life of a— (Woo!)

[Verse 3]
I swear they writin' my third verses in cursive
A catalyst for the reason bitches buyin' these purses
The same reason that I just bought this kush, a nigga burnin'
She likin' my chain, givin' me brain, that bitch learnin', put her up on gang
But all these lives that I changed won't change me
Same cool nigga, same old Breezy
It's so amazin', I'm somethin' major, a thousand dollar tip for the waiter
And I can relate, you should get hella paid for manual labor
All the teachers and the police takin' a hell of a pay cut
Society fucked up, I'm fucked up, when the hell we gon' wake up?
Takin' me to the dark side, killin' me, feelin' like Darth Vader
Think the Lord gon' save you, if you was God, you hate us (Hate us)

[Chorus]
What they don't know (Yeah, uh)
It's just the life of a young nigga
That's what they don't know (Haha, that's just the life, yeah, yeah)
It's just the life of a young nigga
Roll up (Life), alright, yeah
Welcome to the life of a young nigga
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up), haha (Yeah, look, look)
This just the life of a— (Woo!)

[Chorus: D.R.A.M.]
Inside this bag
So many bags just to try and find a place to
Inside this bag you can get stuck going deeper inside
(Losing your mind)
Even when my tank's on E
I'll still go to the party
Let me pick you up
That pick me up
(Where it all goes down)

[Chorus: D.R.A.M.]
Inside this bag
So many bags just to try and find a place to

Even when my tank's on E
I'll still go to the party
Let me pick you up
That pick me up

A tiger
Don't lose no sleep
Don't need opinions
From a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come for me
No, not today
You're calculated
I got your number
'Cause you're a joker
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it

Swish, swish, bish

Your game is tired

You're 'bout cute as
An old coupon expired
And karma's not a liar
She keeps receipts

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Pink Ferragamo sliders on deck
Silly rap beefs just get me more checks
My life is a movie, I'm never off set
Me and my amigos (no, not Offset)
Swish swish, aww I got them upset
But my shooters'll make 'em dance like dubstep
Swish, swish, aww, my haters is obsessed
'Cause I make M's, they get much less
Don't be tryna double back
I already despise you
All that fake love you showin'
Couldn't even disguise you
Ran? When? Nicki gettin' tan
Mirror mirror who's the fairest bitch in all the land?
Damn, man, this bitch is a Stan
Muah, muah, the generous queen will kiss a fan
Ass goodbye, I'ma be riding by
I'ma tell my ----- Biggz, yeah that's tha guy
A star's a star, da ha da ha
They never thought the swish god would take it this far
Get my pimp cup, this is pimp shit, baby

[Intro]
I can see it happening
Happen, I can see it happening
Happen, I can see it

[Verse 1]
Can't go with the flow, got to make waves
Even though I look at the sand, and I'm just one grain
But my intuition says there's a bigger mission I must embrace
So I'm, I'm pushing my thoughts to a new place

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm kicking and screaming
'Cause it won't be easy
To break all the patterns
If I'm not evolving
I'm just another robot
Taking up oxygen

[Chorus]
It's something bigger than me
I can feel it beginning
Something bigger than me
Yeah, I can feel it opening
Tried to ignore it
But it keeps on growing
Out of control
It's something bigger than me
And I can feel it happening

[Verse 2]
So I'll speak my truth though my voice shakes (I can see it)
Try to summon the strength to look fear in the face

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm kicking and screaming
'Cause it won't be easy
To break all the patterns
If I'm not evolving
I'm just another robot
Taking up oxygen

[Chorus]
It's something bigger than me
I can feel it beginning
Something bigger than me
Yeah, I can feel it opening
Tried to ignore it
But it keeps on growing
Out of control (out of control)
It's something bigger than me
And I can feel it happening

[Interlude]
Happening (Oh-ah, oh-ah, oh-ah)
Happen, I can see it happening
Happen, I can see it happening (Oh-ah, oh-ah, oh-ah)
Happen, I can see it happening
I can see it, I can see it, I can see it happening

[Chorus]
It's something bigger than me
Something bigger than me
Yeah, I can feel it opening
Tried to ignore it
But it keeps on growing
Out of control (Out of control)
It's something bigger than me
And I can feel it happening

[Outro]
Happening (I can feel it)
Happen, (I can see it) I can see it happening
(I can feel it)
Happen, I can see it

[Verse 1]
She was a shark smile in a yellow van
She came around and I stole her glance
In my youth, a vampire
Evelyn shown quiet as roses sting
It came over me at a bad time
But who wouldn't ride on a moonlit line?
I had her in my eye, 85 down the road of a dead end gleam

[Chorus]
And she said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too

[Verse 2]
It came over her at a bad time
Riding through Winona down the dotted line
Held us gunning out
90 miles down the road of a dead end dream
She looked over with her part smile
Caught up in the twinkle, it could take awhile
And the money pile on the dashboard fluttering

[Chorus]
As she said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too

[Verse 3]
Evelyn's kiss was oxygen
I leaned over to take it in
As we went howling through the edge of south Des Moines
It came over me at a bad time
She burned over the double line
And she impaled as I reached my hand for the guard rail
Ooh the guard rail
Ooh the guard rail

[Chorus]
She said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too
She said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too

[Intro]
(Hey!)

[Verse 1]
I'm not that nice
I'm mean and I'm evil
Don't call me nice
I'm gonna eat your heart out
I've got some work to do
Baby, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready to blow my lid off

[Interlude]
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Go fuck yourself
You heard me right
Don't call me nice again
Don't you have somewhere to be at 7:30?
Baby, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready to blow my brains out

[Chorus]
You die
And words don't do anything
It's permanently night
And I won't feel anything
We'll all be laughing with you when you die
Words don't do anything
It's permanently night
And I won't feel anything
We'll all be laughing with you when you die

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Go fuck yourself
I'm mean, not nice
You said it twice
You said it twice
Don't you have somewhere to be at 7:30?

[Outro]
I've got some work to do
I'm gonna eat your heart out
I heard you the first time

[Verse 1]
Breathing in the dark, lying on its side
The ruins of the dead painted with a scar
And the more I straighten out, the less it wants to try
The feelings start to rot one wink at a time

[Chorus 1]
Oh
Forgiving who you are for what you stand to gain
Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
When you get out of bed, don't end up stranded
Horrified with each stone on the stage
My little dark age

[Verse 2]
Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby
The carvings on the face say they find it hard
And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise
The humor's not the same, coming from denial

[Chorus 2]
Oh
I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
If you get out of bed and find me standing all alone
Open-eyed, burn the page
My little dark age

[Chorus 3]
I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
You know that if it hides, it doesn't go away
If I get out of bed, you'll see me standing all alone
Horrified on the stage
My little dark age

[Bridge]
Giddy with delight, seeing what's to come
The image of the dead, dead ends in my mind

[Chorus 4]
Policemen swear to God, love's seeping from the guns
I know my friends and I would probably turn and run
If you get out of bed, come find us heading for the bridge
Bring a stone, all the rage
My little dark age

[Chorus 2]
I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
If you get out of bed and find me standing all alone
Open-eyed, burn the page
My little dark age

[Outro]
All alone, open-eyed
Burn the page, my little dark age

[Verse 1]
James
If you heed the call
And you go outside, and wander off
Then home is there
Wherever you will make it
You can always say, "Who's laughing now?"

[Verse 2]
James
If you need a friend
Come right over, you don't even knock
And I'll be home
The door is always open
And we both can say, "Who's laughing now?"

[Chorus]
Oh, James
My little doll
You just go outside and you call
James
Oh, you're never too far off

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Oh, James
My little doll
You just go outside and you call
Oh, James
No, you're never too far off

[Verse 3]
If your fire's out
There's no need to shout
I'm always home
And walk on in
I'll make you tea and breakfast
And we both can say, "Who's laughing now?"

[Outro]
Oh, James
Oh, James
Oh, James
No, you're never too far off (James)
No, you're never too far off
You told me, I see you rise
But, it always falls
I see you come, I see you go
You say, “All things pass into the night”
And I say, “Oh no sir I must say you’re wrong
I must disagree, oh no sir, I must say you’re wrong”
Won’t you listen to me
You told me, I’ve seen it all before
Been there, I’ve seen my hopes and dreams
A lying on the ground
I’ve seen the sky just begin to fall
And you say, “All things pass into the night”
And I say, “Oh no sir, I must say you’re wrong
I must disagree, oh no sir, I must say you’re wrong”
Won’t you listen to me
Good-bye horses I’m flying over you
Good-bye horses I’m flying over you

[Verse 1]
Not everyone can be like me and Michael
The only problem is forgetting which side you're on
So you think the burning light will reappear on summer nights
Like all the rest, but they can't find out

[Verse 2]
In every scene, it's me and Michael
Imaginary bombs, raining down from the clouds
So it seems, the danger signs will never let the feelings die
When all the best and brightest have gone

[Chorus]
Me and Michael
Solid as they come
Me and Michael
It's not a question now
Me and Michael
Solid as they come
Me and Michael
It's not a question now
Me and Michael

[Verse 3]
Binary stars sink, like the setting sun
Too happy with ourselves to notice when the change had come
So you think, the losing side would never break dividing lines
But sanctity wasn't in doubt

[Chorus]
Me and Michael
Solid as they come
Me and Michael
It's not a question now
It's me and Michael
Solid as they come
Me and Michael
It's not a question now
Me and Michael

[Intro: Carmody]
Ephemeral love
Ephemeral love
Ephemeral love
Ephemeral love

It starts with this
With this buzz in my blood
It rises
Unspoken in us
Still swimming in the sound of your voice
Holding my breath deep now 'cause I've got no choice
It starts with this
It starts with...

[Instrumental]

Was only a kiss
Still plays on my mind
How could I miss
What was never mine
I'm bouncing at the sound of your name
Will I ever feel this way again
It was only a kiss
It was only...

[Chrous: Tom Misch & Will Heard]
Sing it all together now (When you want the love)
Fix it up and shake it down
Sing it all together now
Fix it up and shake it down
Sing it all together now
Fix it up and shake it down
Sing it all together now
Fix it up and shake it down

[Verse 1: Will Heard]
Sometimes I need to get away
To find myself a brighter day
Sometimes I need to find a way
'Cause it gets hard, so hard to stay

[Tom Misch]
'Cause I know I'm a lucky man
I just need to understand
Loving each other is a major plan
Loving each other is a major plan
'Cause I was drowning in city lights
Couldn't perceive what was wrong from right
Working all day all through the night
Working all day all through the night

[Chrous: Tom Misch & Will Heard]
Sing it all together now (When you want the love)
Fix it up and shake it down
Sing it all together now
Fix it up and shake it down
Sing it all together now
Fix it up and shake it down
Sing it all together now
Fix it up and shake it down

[Verse 2: Will Heard]
Healing under the willow tree
This is where I need to be
Welcoming a little peace
Sitting with the falling leaves

[Tom Misch]
'Cause I know I'm a lucky man
I just need to understand
Loving each other was a major plan
Loving each other was a major plan
'Cause I was drowning in city lights
Couldn't perceive what was wrong from right
Working all day all through the night
Working all day all through the night

[Chorus: Khalid]
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe

[Verse 1: Future]
Got L-O-V-E on my right leg, that's Gucci (Get what I'm sayin'?)
Got L-O-V-E on my main ho, that's Pucci (Get what I'm sayin'?)
Caught a lil' jetlag but I'm golden, damn
We deserve Grammys and some Oscars, damn
They deserve Whammy's, they imposters
I be rollin' with my project homies, it's a vibe
I just did some pills with the homie, it's a vibe
Bend her over, switch sides, it's a vibe, yah

[Refrain: Future]
I come through with strippers and some shottas
I gotta accept that I'm a monster
I pull up in several different options
Not all, but most of 'em came topless
I'll shatter your dreams with this cream I make (Cream I make)
Gotta be on codeine to think of shit I say (Shit I say)
I can't feel my toes and ain't gon' fold up (Fold up)
I was in the double R when I rolled up (When I rolled up)

[Chorus: Khalid]
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe

[Verse 2: Future]
Pluto
Gotta dig what I'm sayin', Chanel drapes on me, baby
Gotta dig what I'm sayin', she look like she's sponsored by Mercedes
Dig what I'm sayin', this Creed cologne is on me, baby (You dig?)
Dig what I'm sayin'? I'm goin' hard (Hard, yeah)
I pop bubbly in your memory
You should be glad I'm showin' you sympathy (Showin' you sympathy)
I gave you real love out the gutter (Out the gutter)
Ever let you go, you gon' suffer (You gon' suffer from it)

[Refrain: Future]
I come through with strippers and some shottas (Shottas)
I gotta accept that I'm a monster
I pull up in several different options
Not all, but most of 'em came topless
I'll shatter your dreams with this cream I make (Cream I make)
Gotta be on codeine to think of shit I say (Shit I say)
I can't feel my toes and ain't gon' fold up (Fold up)
I was in the double R when I rolled up (When I rolled up)

[Outro: Khalid & Future]
Yeah, L-O-V-E on my right leg
Nah Hendrix overload, dig what I'm sayin'?
I feel like I should be giving up
You can leave if it's too much
But I'm tired of you leading me on, oh no
I don't like where this shit is going
I mean I've been stuck in all your apologies
Gave my all but you want more from me
Keep your love, it doesn't feel the same
I hope it hurts you when you're hearin' my name

[Verse 1: Jessie Reyez]
I don't like to talk, but I love to sing
And I don't smoke, but I love to drink
I'm paranoid, I don't miss a thing
But I'm still nice, at least that's what I think
Fall in love, like I'm a fiend
But then I pull out, and say
"I need freedom, I need freedom" (woah-woah)

[Pre-Chorus: Jessie Reyez]
I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it
I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it

[Chorus: Jessie Reyez]
Baby, I'd rather be hard to love
Than easy to leave, you should believe me
I'll make you need me
I'd rather be hard to love
Than easy to leave, you should believe me
I'll make you need me

[Verse 2: Jessie Reyez]
'Course you love me, you don't know me
But I got news for you, I came broken
Ego issues, my head is swollen
I got a million chips on my shoulder
But if you stick despite all I showed ya
Maybe you don't need freedom, freedom

[Pre-Chorus: Jessie Reyez]
I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it
I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it (yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)

[Chorus: Jessie Reyez]
Baby, I'd rather be hard to love
Than easy to leave, you should believe me
I'll make you need me
I'd rather be hard to love
Than easy to leave, you should believe me
I'll make you need me

[Bridge: Jessie Reyez]
Go deeper, go deep
I love it when your roots go deep so I know you won't leave
Go deeper, go deep
I love it when your roots go deep so I know you won't leave
Go deeper
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real (woah-oh-oh)
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real

[Refrain: Jessie Reyez]
Go deeper (woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Go deeper (woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Outro: Jessie Reyez]
Go deeper
Go deep
Oh my God, that feels nuts on its own
That shit feels like fucking
That shit feels like, that shit feels like some ego tripping shit

[Intro:]
Oh yeah, don't forget my retainer
OK, I understand you guys are pleading insanity, claiming demonic spirits possessed you to do these hideous murders. Can you please explain to this court how these so-called spirits made you into these raving madmen?

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Relax and take notes
While I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke; gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor
The rap slayer, the hooker layer
Motherfucker, say your prayers!
"Hail Mary, full of grace," smack the bitch in the face
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face off her back
Jab her if she act, funny with the money
Oh, you got me mistaken, honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like The Vapors
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho?
The head honcho, swift fist, like Camacho
I got so much style I should be down with the Stylistics
"Make up to break up" Niggas need to wake up
Smell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia
She don't remember shit, just the two hits
Her hittin' the floor and me hittin' the clit
Sucking on the tits, had the hooker beggin' for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly, love, my dick got rocked quick
I guess I was a combination
Of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was humpin' around and jumpin' around
Jacked her, then I asked her, "Who's the man?"
She said, "B-I-G," then I'd bust in her E-Y-E
(Yo big, you're dead wrong)

[Interlude:]
Can you please explain to this court when these problems first began?

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves ya rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, uh
Leave you toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the TEC, G
Disrespect me, my potency is deadly
I'm shootin' babies; no ifs, ands, or maybes
Hit Mommy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis, after she sucked the dick
I stabbed her brother with the ice pick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that
Got your father hidin' in a room, fucked him with a broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feelin' it
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab you 'til you're gushy, so please don't pushh me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hooker screamin'
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?

[Interlude:]
**gunshots**
Guilty! Next case
Yeah-ahh...
Looking round the room
I can tell that you
Are the most beautiful girl in the...room
In the whole wide room
Oooh

And when you're on the street
Depending on the street
I bet you are definitely in the top three
Good looking girls on the street...yeah...
And depending on the street, ooh...
And when I saw you at my mate's place
I thought what...is...she...doing...
At my mate's place
How did Dave get a hottie like that to a party like this?

Good one Dave!!!
Ooohhhh you're a legend, Dave!
I asked Dave if he's going to make a move on you
He's not sure
I said "Dave do you mind if I do?"
He says he doesn't mind
But I can tell he kinda minds
But I'm gonna do it anyway
I see you standing all alone by the stereo
I dim the lights down very low, here we go
You're so beautiful (beautiful)
You could be a waitress
You're so beautiful (beautiful)
You could be an air hostess in the 60s
You're so beautiful
You could be a part time model

And then I seal the deal
I do my moves
I dance the robot
Ohh-ohh-ohh, ohh-ohh-ohh!

It's twelve o two
Just me and you
And seven other dudes
Around you on the dance floor
I draw you near
Let's get outta here
Let's get in a cab
I'll buy you a kebab!

Now I can't believe
That I'm sharing a kebab with the most beautiful girl I have ever seen
With a kebab
Ooooooohhh
Why don't we leave?
Let's go to my house and we can feel each other up on the couch
Oh no. I don't mind taking it slow-ho-ho, no-ho-ho, yeah

Cause you're so beautiful
You're so beautiful-ul-ul...
You're like one of those girls I've definitely been chatting to in that chat room
You're so beautiful
Wild slut angel 22 at yahoo
You're so beautiful
Like a tree
Or some nice ceramics or something
Or like a high class prostitute
You're so beautiful
But you'd probably have to keep your normal job
A part-time model!
But I could see you in an auto show dancing on a car
Spending part of your time, modeling
And part of your time, next to meeeeeeeeee!
And I suppose the  rest of your time doing your normal job

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Keep you on my side like the loud pack
Baby where you been?
Dipping in a Benz
Need you right beside me like the loud pack
Party with your friends
Bring 'em to the crib
It's all good with me, I got the loud pack
Bring it to the crib, you know what it is
We gon' get it lit, just like the loud pack
And I'm with the shits
Pull up with ah stick
Pull up, light the motherfucking loud pack

Loud pack
Dipping in the 'gatti, baby

Still whipping and the digits long as lo mein
Whipping on the side, I'ma...

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Keep you on my side like the loud pack
Baby where you been?
Dipping in a Benz
Need you right beside me like the loud pack

Bring it to the crib, you know what it is
We gon' get it lit, just like the loud pack
And I'm with the shits

Pull up, light the motherfucking loud pack

[Verse 2: Dave East]
We go to Cali smoking Cali, this shit loud
Backwood on fire, so got my eyes low, blow this pound
First class, I don't do no more coach
When I was broke I still had smoke
That blunt not done, I hit that roach
Got two bitches and they smoking out
We don't know no drought
I can show you what this dough about
I woke up on a cloud, Takeoff
My diamonds Offset
Got her number, ain't called yet
Lambo, the trunk in front of it, pulling up, I ain't parked yet
On Collins couple Haitians close
Honestly we take jewelry better than we can take a joke
Got the head off a eighth of dope
Came back to the crib, back to the face, I ain't passing it
Before I used to package it
All the smokin', I mastered it, loud

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Keep you on my side like the loud pack
Baby where you been?
Dipping in a Benz
Need you right beside me like the loud pack
Party with your friends
Bring 'em to the crib
It's all good with me, I got the loud pack
Bring it to the crib, you know what it is
We gon' get it lit, just like the loud pack
And I'm with the shits

Pull up, light the motherfucking loud pack

Lil' swag I'm smoking 'em swishers
I like my hoes by the mixture
I keep the lean in my pitcher
And I ball like Derek Fisher
Petrov, Yelyena, and me
Lost, but happy, at sea
Petrov and Yelyena said to me, "Shouldn't we have something to eat?"

Well, I say, "There are plenty of fish in the sea"
But all they can see... is me

They say, "Any last requests?" Biding my time, I say "Yes
I want to party, just we three. Lost, but happy at sea."

So we drank all night from the keg
I passed out, then awoke with one leg
I said, "Petrov, have you seen my leg?"
He said "No" and he went back to bed....
But he looked suspiciously well fed

Three days later they were hungry again
They said, "Any last requests, my friend, again?"
I said, "Do you know any Rolling Stones?
You know, like you're at a rock concert going 'More, more!' You know?"

[Spoken] "Ahh, it was a hilarious, hilarious moment in a very bleak, bleak time of my life."

So we danced all night to the Rolling Stones
When I awoke, they were chewing on bones
Yelyena was supping blood from a cup
That's when I knew something was up

[Spoken] "Hey Petrov?"
"What?"
"What is that you're eating?"
"Nothing"
"It looks likea meat."
"Ohhhhh, this? It's umm, one of those, umm.....fish."
"How come it looks so much like my arm?"
"It's an.... arm fish."
"What about the fingers?"
"Fish fingers."
"Well, you see, the thing is, my arm seems to haveabeen hacked off at the elbow last night. I was just wondering if you might have seen it."
"Oh, yeah, look at that, no arm over there. Oh... don't you hate it when that happens? I don't know, um... you were very drunk last night. Perhaps you lost it?.. In a fair game of chance."
"Oh, you're probably right."
"Yeah, you know how it is when we're drunk."
"Yeah"
"''I'll bet my arm'"
"Oh."
"Just relax. Enjoy the sea, and have some... fish."
Four months now lost at sea
My friends have almost finished me
Now they are using recipes....

[Spoken] Tonight, we are having some 'me goreng'

"But wait, this 'you goreng' is absolutely delicious. You should come over here right away and try some, you really would be proud of yourself."
"How can I?! You have eaten all of my leg!"
"OoOooooOooooh... someone obviously isn't getting any."

Late that night, while they were asleep
I swallowed some arsenic to poison my meat
I was very ill, but revenge is so sweet...
Unlike the last meal my comrades would eat

When I awoke, they were already dead
All that was left of me was my head...
No, not dead, just a head
Lost, but happy, at sea
Lost, but lonely, at sea
Lost, but so lonely...
At sea

[Verse]
D-Town, Westside, yeah, I said it, Westside
But they yelling Big so much that you would thought it's Bed-Stuy
You are now rocking with the newest, newest best out
Go and roll that good up, 'cause I'm stressed out
I come a city where 9-11 dialled up
Everybody riled up, a hundred gun pile up
They'll lay it on the line, line, make sure you don't get filed up
Hammers in and out of court, boy, don't get trialled up

[Outro]
Yeah
She’s been hiding, from my eyes
I’ve been haunted, late at night

I see vividly, the place i'll be, with her
And all this sympathy is wearing me
Down to my bone

I've been calling, it's not right
She’s just bathing in moonlight

But I see vividly, the place I'll be, with her
And all this sympathy ​is wearing me
Down to my bone
In the next world war
In the one you left behind
I am born again

In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
An airbag saved my life

In an interstellar burst
I'm back to save the universe

In a deep deep sleep
In a love you never had
I am born again

In a fast German car
In the juggernaut lane
I am born again

In an interstellar burst
I'm back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I'm back to save the universe

[Over intro]
'Eyo, what's going on, my name is Eminem and you're listening to the Stretch Armstrong and Whoo Kid mixtape, stupid
The Murda Mixtape; if you don't like it suck my penis
You know that little thing

[Intro]
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam
Like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, (Whoo Kid!) throwin' her over furniture {Aww!}
It's the return of the… "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though."
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to (What!?) hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss (Get back!)
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes, then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope (Eugh)
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes…

[Hook]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just (Stretch Armstrong is now in your world) imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too! (Ha ha!)
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me
Let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee."
I should download the audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk, and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

[Hook]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to
‘Cause I'm only givin' you things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false (Hah!) or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it
I just shit it better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: "How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?"
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King
Spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screamin', "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

[Hook]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up? (Haha!)

[Outro]
Ha ha, I guess there’s a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let’s all stand up

[Verse 1]
Blowing over like wind
Electrifying the place
Knowing that all I want is to see your face
Your body's on my mind
And I can't seem to erase
Your footsteps pit pattered all over my heartstrings

[Chorus]
But I don't know why I let you dance into my life
Might be the best decision I've made in a while
I don't believe in love at at first sight
But something 'bout you makes that all seem like a lie

[Verse 2]
Your footwork's second to none
Prancing over my barriers
Knocking over all my insecurities
Watching you glide across the floor
Does something to me
I can't help but feel the way I do, I'm falling

[Chorus]
But I don't know why I let you dance into my life
Might be the best decision I've made in a while
I don't believe in love at at first sight
But something 'bout you makes that all seem like a lie

[Interlude]
I don't know how but fell through into my life
And made it all better
So stay a while
So stay a while
Just stay a while

[Chorus]
Don't know why I let you dance into my life
Might be the best decision I've made in a while
I don't believe in love at at first sight
But something 'bout you makes that all seem like a lie

[Intro]
Oh, oh, huh, oh, oh, huh, oh, oh, huh (I like it), oh-huh, oh

[Verse]

Risin' to the top you 'bout yo' cream
Taste it in the morning, in they dreams
I bring home the bacon, egg and cheese
He put that Hitachi on the bean
Straw up in my coffee 'cause my teeth white

Top of the morning, that's when he lick me up

[Bridge]

[Intro]
You know
Whatever the brain doesn't have a word for it can't see
I teach you this all the time
The world is mind
M-I-N-D

[Verse 1]
There were two patients laying in the hospital
They shared the same room, both fighting health obstacles
The first patient had his bed by the window
He could see outside and feel how the wind blow
The second patient, his bed was by the wall
No window, he couldn't see nothing at all
So in summary there was no sun to see
He was laying in the dark looking for recovery
He could see the other patients looking outside
And jealousy took over his pride, he couldn't hide
He said to the patient by the window
"Hey! Tell me what you see outside there today"
The patient by the window started saying
"I see people walking, talking, I see children playing"
"Cars going by with the booming systems"
But the patient by the wall could only lay and listen
Bedridden, he couldn't see it for himself
But the descriptions he was given was improving his health
Everyday the patient by the window would say what he saw
And everyday the patient by the wall wanted more
But what he wanted even more instead
Was to be in the patient by the window's bed
He wanted the same bed that the patient had
If he could just exchange beds it would make him glad
So one day the patient by the window was gone
And the patient by the wall knew something was wrong
But he still asked the nurse if he could be first
To get the bed by the window, and what's worse
He did get the bed by the window
But the shock instead was a wall full of brick stone
No cars, no people, no scenery
No light, no flowers, no greenery at all
It was like just a brick wall facing the window
He said to the nurse "I was tricked, yo"
The nurse said "Tricked? You'll be fine"
But a view of a brick wall he didn't have in mind
And what really blew his mind
Is when the nurse said, "Cheer up
The previous patient, he was blind"
He realized right at that time
You create your reality, the world is mind

[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
Its time to kick ass

Yeah
Same shit
Yeah
Same shit
Wake up

[Verse 1]
Listen
Terrorists and governments play the same game
Banks and big business take the same blame
Open your brain
The Klan and the cops are the same
Slave quarters, blocks, and prison blocks are the same
They only separated by name
Overrated by fame
What's in a name?
Our colonists is the same
People can't really see it
Because they're blocked by the name
But really Nazi Germany and your black is the same
Look
Wall Street and Main Street
Really that's the same street
Drug talk, corporate talk
Really that's the same speak
Boom bap, boom bip
Really that's the same beat
A throne or a chair in your home
Really that's the same seat
I wrote and recorded this album in the same week
California and Barcelona
Its got the same heat
I walk the same street
Put no trust in the game
Good cop, bad cop
They one and the same
Same shit

[Bridge]
You know
Listen

[Verse 2]
Rapper and politicians they want the same thing
To kneel before their master and kiss the same ring
But Solomon and Selassi them are the same king
So from (?) I spit the same swing
Ding ding ding, there goes the bell
I'm the same as heaven, these dudes the same as hell
I'm the same as the plane at liftoff, fly
They the same as a rip-off, a lie
I remind you
Don't let the criminal mind blind you
Instead let the spiritual mind find you
See I'm you
Just twenty years ahead
Its to your advantage to hear KRS-ONE and rewind what he said
Its the same shit

[Bridge]
Its the same shit
Look

[Verse 3]
Drug cartels is what sells the medical
Drug spots and drug stores are identical
Y'all need to wake up and join with the woke folk
Ignorance is only gonna keep you with them broke folk
KRS is on some cool shit
I ain't nothing to fool with
I teach more kids than the school gets
Game over, stupid
Its like we at the eight ball corner pocket
And I got the pool stick
You can say whatever, me I'm living better and better
Getting cheddar, out in Greece getting the feta
Up in Catalonia only eating paella
Up in Italy getting bread, call it bruscetta
I spit
They cruise cars, I cruise ships
Democrat and Republican, that's the same shit
Its the same shit

[Verse 1]
Why these people always gotta front
Why people can't be real from the jump
I'mma be blunt so inhale it
My flow is like the ocean, I sail it
Metaphoric oceanic flow, run it
Like the ocean I'mma stay current
From the first time I rhyme they spun it
Any MC test BDP sound we a bun it
They just begun it, we the veteran
Better than any of them and we keep it 100
I'm the blast master but faster
I'm the same that influenced the game I'm named after
Hip-hop - don't fight the hunch, spike the punch
Take it back to the Castor Bunch
I'm having these rappers for lunch
I'm giving their captain a crunch
Munch, crunch, hunch up
You feeling KRS, put your ones up

[Verse 1]
I represent leadership, readership, teachership, speakership
Culture keeper cause the culture we're keeping it
Truth I'm speaking it, critics want to weaken it
Printing gossip and bullshit and the people believing it
Gather 'round now for the freshest guy
If you're new to hip-hop KRS is I
I don't tell no lie, that bullshit that they're talking online
That's the tactics of the FBI
Y'all falling for the same old disunity thing
That's why Malcolm X couldn't link with Dr. King
Why William DuBois was against Marcus Garvey
Together they could have built a strong black army
But not hardly arguments between Bobby Seel and
Huey P. Newton rocked the Black Panther party
We need to wake up these strategies are old
Unity that's the goal let's go

[Chorus]
That real shit just keeps flowing
That real shit just keeps going
That real shit just keeps flowing
That real shit just keeps going

[Verse 2]
Line after line after line after line
Since 1989 I been way ahead of my time
But it's frustrating hearing all the hating and debating
And the faking and the waking, man we got to reawaken
The time that we be wasting, debating and fighting
We can see we unenlightened, man look what we writing
You got the most advanced technology in the palm of your hand
And all you can do is turn around and diss your man
That's like a baby with a loaded gun
Thinking its a load of fun, me, I'm a little older son
We done seen dudes dies and cry and get by
We done seen cops shoot down blacks and just lie
So when Latifah put up U-N-I-T-Y
Why didn't anyone comply, y'all living a lie
The truth is the proof and we got to get it straight
Revolution only works for those that participate

[Chorus]
That real shit just keeps flowing
The real shit just keeps going
The real shit just keeps flowing
The real shit just keeps going

[Refrain]
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

[Pre-Hook]
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

[Hook]
But just hold on, we're going home
But just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
But just hold on, we're going home

[Refrain]
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
Left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

[Pre-Hook]
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

[Hook]
Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home

[Bridge]
You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there's something
Well you're the girl, you're the one
I gave you everything I loved
I think there's something, baby
Yeah yeah yeah

Just hold on
Jemaine and Bret:
Frodo, don't wear the ring
I know it's very tempting
Yes, you will appear to disappear
But the dark riders, they'll know you're there
Yes, Lord Sauron has many spies…

Jemaine:
Many spies have many eyes…

Jemaine and Bret:
One ring to find them, to bind them
One ring to rule them all
One ring to find them, one to bind them
One ring to rule them all!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
You've got to rule them
You've got to rule them with the ring
Frodo, rule them
Rule them with the ring!
Jemaine:
Lord Sauron has many spies—beasts and birds

Bret:
I am not a conjurer of cheap tricks!

Jemaine:
B-b-beasts and b-b-birds

Bret:
Do they, Gandalf?

Bret:
If you want him, come and claim him!

Bret:
Merry, Pippin, G-G-Gandalf!

Jemaine:
I'm alright! I was saved by a giant eagle! (roars)

Bret:
Ching ching! Uh! Ah!

Jemaine:
G-g-giant eagle!
Jemaine:
O-o-one r-ring, one r-ring

Jemaine:
You have my sword

Bret:
And my bow

Jemaine:
And my axe!

Jemaine:
G-g-giant eagle!

Jemaine and Bret:
Yo Frodo, what you doin' wearing the ring?
All-powerful jewelry, is that your new thing?
I know it's hard when you're little more than 3 foot 4
Little ass so close to the floor
Trying to lead the fellows to the gates of Mordor
The Fellowship!
(Yeah, the Fellowship)

I don't rap about bitches and hoes
I rap about witches and trolls
Just passing on the words of the Elven king
Wisdom to all
Frodo! Don't wear the ring!
Jemaine and Bret:
Frodo, don't wear the ring
You'll never be the Lord of the Rings

Jemaine and Bret:
Dwarves! Elves! Human beings! Don't know what it is? It's the Lord of the Rings!

[Verse 1: 3rd Eye]
I got gats, best to back up off me
Get that ass open like a body part melting
I make up and I break niggas, snakes stabbin' snake
I rock techniques (Ah!), y'all freak the funky fly shit, 3rd Eye shit
When I get ill, my skill's simply amazing
A schizo, I flip like I forgot to take my pills
Sinking deep up in your bed, then y'all bring all 2 of them
Sick motherfucker from the projects I grew up in
And do incredible, unforgettable shit, you know?
Them niggas from the ghetto, no, we don't be bullshitting
1993, who can see me? Best to go ahead of me
Troop, you know my pedigree, you better be strapped
'Cause I'm strapped, ready to catch a body
Biggie got the burner, TROO-KULA got the shotty
Niggas wanna step into my cycle
And I roll on the trifling, flow like
Living, backstabbing, crabbing
You dirty rat, I'm not trying to hear that
Pass the motherfucking gat, troop, here it at
Let me get that, man, I'm with that
Wait, where my spliff at? You bitch, now let me hit that
The night tripper, script flipper
Pistol gripper, Jack the Ripper
Nobody's ipper than the rep-wrecker Wesstar
Look mom, I'm blowing up
Your little son is doing stickups

[Verse 2: Capital LS]
Yo, yo, fuck that, I'm here to bust up out a crack track
In fact, mack, I keeps the ill rhymes on attack
Think I'm a type of anthrax, who needs ex-lax?
Jacks, car-jacks, stick you for your Sugar Smacks
And your baby piffs, giving you mind flips
Misfits, lift the gun until the number one thump's done
Grab, grab your dick and gets freaky
Buckshot the boots if the bitch look sneaky
Tugging on my dreadlocks, swallowing the bed bugs
Gunshots around the mad blocks
(We funky niggas)
So don't try to check the dick
Fuck around and maybe lose your resolution
Chris the capital L to the freak the L
So open the hatch and let the juice spill

[Chorus: All, Face]
Big up, big up, it's a stickup, stickup
Big up, big up, it's a stickup, nigga

See me, prolly counting, yo enough of that
Fuck that,  having that
I'm on a ill track, big raps, you want facts, black
Is it time to get ill? Yo, I feel sicker than a junkie cold turkey
Man, I need a bitch, how you wanna lick
Hold me hostage, me in bondage, imagine
I may burn your priest yo
My nigga West is kinda Schizo, I'm psycho (Yeah)
Leave us alone, we can hold our own
Jimmy Crack Corn, word is bond
I be wettin' niggas mortuaries up, they wouldn't know it
Where's the funeral, burial? I'm coming strapped
It's that nigga wanted throwing that nigga on his back
I'm the gat toter (Say what?), body bloater (Say what?)
Hudson River (I heard), nigga shipper

[Verse 4: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Now niggas wanna get too close to the upmost
But I got stacks that'll attack any wack host
"Introducing-" yo, fuck that nigga's name
My hip hop drops on your head like rain
And when it rains it pours, because my rhymes hardcore
That's why I give you more of the raw
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MC's I'm burn, I'm burning hot
Oh ho ho ho ho, let me slow up with the flow
'Cause if I move too quick, hoe, ya just won't know
I'm homicidal when you enter the target
Niggas get up, act like a pig, try to hog shit
That's why I take 'em out quick
The mic's done had it, you can suck my motherfucking dick
If you wanna step to the motherfucking rep
Chk-chk, blaow, blaow, blaow, blown to death
You got shot because you're—knock, knock, knock, who's there?
Another motherfucking heart rock
Slacking on your macking cause raw's what you lack
Don't wanna react, but just bring it on back

[Chorus: All, Face]
Big up, big up, it's a stickup, stickup
Big up, big up, it's a stickup, nigga
Big up, big up, it's a stickup, stickup
I get paid, you get slayed

[Verse 5: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Let me begin, the .357's to your abdomen
Shh, listen, Biggie's on a mission
I'm startin' to drool, give me the jewels
You know the rules, nigga
Throw ya face down in the river
Cement shoes, I do bruise
Gunshots to the back from the Big MAC attack
Two all-beef patties, special sauce, who's the boss?
I got the gun and make you "Jump" like Kriss Kross
And when I squeeze, nigga please

[Verse 1]
Take me as I am, take me, baby, in stride
Only you can save me tonight
There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You let me in, don't leave me out, or leave me dry

[Pre-Chorus]
Even when I'm alone, I'm not lonely
I hear the sweetest melodies (Sweetest melodies)
On the fire escapes of the city
Sounds like I am free (It's got me singin')

[Chorus]
God bless America, and all the beautiful women in it
God bless America, and all the beautiful women in it
May you stand proud and strong like Lady Liberty shinin' all night long
God bless America

[Verse 2]
Take me as I am, don't see me for what I'm not
Only you can hear me tonight
Keep your light on, babe, I might be standin' outside
You let me in, don't leave me out, or leave me dry

[Pre-Chorus]
Even walkin' alone, I'm not worried
I feel your arms all around me (Arms around me)
In the air on the streets of the city
Feels like I am free (It's got me thinkin')

[Chorus]
God bless America, and all the beautiful women in it
God bless America, and all the beautiful women in it
May you stand proud and strong like Lady Liberty shinin' all night long
God bless America

[Bridge]
(Sweetest melodies)
Even with you, I've got no one to lose
So you'd better believe that nobody can make me feel lonely
Because I hear (Sweetest melodies)
Even when you talk that talk with the lights on
I still somehow know that I'll never feel, ever feel lonely
I have no fear (It's got me thinkin', yeah)

[Chorus]
God bless America, and all the beautiful women in it
God bless America, and all the beautiful people in it
May they stand proud and strong like Lady Liberty shinin' all night long
God bless America, and all the beautiful people in it
And all the beautiful people in it

[Intro]
Im off a few shots of patron right now since nigga's wanna be putting  too much alcohol in the Bombay and shit...
Plus we ain't got no McQueen
Its on the way though

Ughhh

[Verse 1]
Smoke one for my niggas thats gone
Bottles up she in love with a don
Used to smoke bad weed in a wood
Now she put her KK in a Raw
Bust down Cartier on my arm
Look like my iPhone going off
Smoke strong keep supreme in the jar
Play the game like I seen this before
Used to be a young nigga shooting hoops
Now the people calling me the new Snoop
Speaking of Snoop real life thats my OG
Smoked out at Demi Lovato's party
Niggas saying they on top I ain't buying it
Slice hitting sharp ,mine keep flying private
Now the money from my WeedFarm piling
Day ones only kind Ima ride wit'

[Interlude]
Now ya'll go head and smoke sum
Wait for that Rolling Papers 2 to come out
Matter fact smoke 2 of them thang's
You dug
TGOD

[Chorus]
Pass it lets get high today
Pass it let your girl get blazed
Don't pass it if its not KK
I won't hit no

[Refrain: Shakira]
I'm leaving with a broken heart
I never meant to do you harm
Don't ever wanna see you cry, again
And everybody hurts sometimes
I never meant to do you wrong
I know you're gonna be just fine, he said

[Verse 1: Shakira]
I wish we could go back in time
See the world with different eyes
Knowing what we both know now
Could've made it work somehow

[Hook: Shakira & MAGIC!]
What we said, what we say
What we made we can't unmake
What we give is what we get
And this is what we're stuck with now
But we said, whatever that we said
What we made you know we can't unmake
What we give is only what we get
And this is what we're stuck with now

[Refrain: Shakira]
I'm leaving with a broken heart
I never meant to do you harm
Don't ever wanna see you cry, again
But everybody hurts sometimes
I never meant to do you wrong
I know you're gonna be just fine, he said

[Verse 2: MAGIC!]
I wish we could go back in time
Find a road that doesn’t wind
Right now darling we would be
Beautiful like harmony

[Hook: Shakira & MAGIC!]
What we said, what we say
What we made, we can't unmake
What we give is what we get
And this is what we're stuck with now
But we said whatever that we said
What we made you know we can't unmake
What we get is only what we gave
And this is what we're stuck with now

[Bridge: Shakira & MAGIC!]
Do you remember how you used to get lost in my eyes?
(I remember, darling)
Do you remember how you promised you'd never say goodbye?
I remember, I remember, I remember

[Hook: Shakira, MAGIC! & both]
But we said and what we said
What we made we can't unmake
What we give is only what we get
And this is what we're stuck with now

[Refrain: Shakira]
I'm leaving with a broken heart
I never meant to do you harm
Don't ever wanna see you cry, again
But everybody hurts sometimes
I never meant to do you wrong
I know you're gonna be just fine, he said
Again

[Verse 1]
We hid on a plane
Flying across the sky
Searching for islands where we could land
Too far away to be found
We took off our clothes and danced like if we'd gone mad
Took a dip in the ocean
To wash away all the sand

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not alone
Not anymore this time
I found my love

[Chorus]
Under a coconut tree
Where we created a universe
Hiding from all of that
Where nothing mattered but you and me
Make it like it used to be
Give me a time machine
With you and I riding on a dream
Only you and me
Under a coconut tree
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh

[Verse 2]
It's like we designed the anatomy of a dream
As crazy in love as we'd ever be
Inside a fantasy
Under the stars
Floating above the sea
And we were lost like
We always dreamed to be

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not alone
I say to myself
I found my home

[Chorus]
Under a coconut tree
Where we created a universe
Hiding from all of that
Where nothing mattered but you and me
Oh, make it like it used to be
Give me a time machine
With you and I riding on a tree
Only you and me
Under a coconut tree
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh

[Bridge]
Oooh
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Outro]
We hid on a plane
Flying across the sky
Searching for islands where we could land

[Verse 1: Jason Derulo]
Love in a thousand different flavors
I wish that I could taste them all tonight
No, I ain't got no dinner plans
So you should bring all your friends
I swear that a-all y'all my type
Baby, I just wanna thank your momma
For giving you that thing that dutty wine
I tried to be a gentleman, but all this liquor going to my head
Got me thinking all yall are mine

[Pre-Hook: Jason Derulo]

Pussy game still cold, we don't get minks for that
And when I'm poppin' them bananas, we don't link chimps for that
I gave these bitches two years, now your time's up
Bless her heart, she throwing shots but every line sucks

[Pre-Hook: Jason Derulo]

Bad girl do anything for a young
Bust down on my wrist, yes

She said "Boy, if you a freak, well then prove it, then"
And it if did we're maneuvering

You ain't no freak if you don't swalla

To symphonies of blinding light
Like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away, oh

And when I close my eyes, tonight
To symphonies of blinding light, oh
Like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away

[Verse 1]
Isn't she lovely
Isn't she wonderful
Isn't she precious
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely made from love

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Yeah, yeah yeah
It's the Notorious Biggie Smalls
When I ain't on Fulton Street, sipping a Becks, steaming an L with the Junior M.A.F.I.A.
Or on Bedford Avenue with my DJ The Hitman 50 Grand and the O.G.B., getting tore down
We listening to the best of both worlds with Mr. Magic Spanish Fly and my main doo-doo stain, Mister Cee.
On The Wheels Of Steel every Thursday night, on 91.5 Skills FM. I'm a ghost like Michael Landon, peace.

[Verse 1]

Oh, oh, I be cookin' too much not to eat
If you ain't helpin' me get on my feet

[Intro]
Tra la la!

[Verse 1]
Are you worried 'bout impending doom?
Those evil villains got you filled with gloom?
Don't you fear, there's a hero in the sky, the sky, the sky

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's not a bird and it's not a plane
And it's not an egg salad sandwich
It's the waistband warrior
Hear his mighty battle cry
Tra la la!

[Chorus 1]
Underpants! Hey, watch out, crime!
It's Captain Underpants! It's wedgie power time!
Na-na-na-na-na, Captain Underpants, yeah, yeah, yeah
Faster than a speeding waistband!
Underpants! He's busting down doors
Captain Underpants! While wearing just his drawers
Na-na-na-na-na, Captain Underpants, yeah, yeah, yeah
More powerful than boxer shorts!

[Post-Chorus 1]
His name is Under, Under, Underpants!
I'm saying Under, Under, Underpants!
Oh by some unlikely chance
Captain Underpants is his name
Tra, tra-tra, tra-tra la la!

[Verse 2]
Snap your fingers and he'll be right there
That freaky bald dude in his underwear
He'll drop his trousers and fight to save the day, the day, the day

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There he goes in his dashing cape
Here he comes in his tighty whiteys
All the bad guys soil themselves every time they hear him say
"Tra la la!"

[Chorus 2]
Underpants! Yeah, who's that hunk?!
Captain Underpants! Is that cotton pre-shrunk?
Na-na-na-na-na, Captain Underpants, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now it is time to fly again!
Underpants! Suspend your disbelief
Captain Underpants! He'll save the world in his briefs
Na-na-na-na-na, Captain Underpants, yeah, yeah, yeah
To the skies! Wow!

[Post-Chorus 2]
Under, Under, Underpants
I'm saying Under, Under, Underpants
Check out that superhero stance
Captain Underpants is his name
Stand down, Poopypants!
Oh, Under, Under, Underpants!
He's Captain Under, Under, Underpants!
By some crazy circumstance
Captain Underpants is his name
Tra, tra-tra, tra-tra la la!

[Intro (Ab-Soul)]
Aw, this is four jiggling balls in your mouth all day everyday
Ay you tuned into a fuck what you hear radio where you can stick a dick in your ear and um
(Stick a dick in my ear??) Aw shut the fuck up bitch but anyway
We got this new K Dot record I know you a trap where you at baby

[Verse 1 (K Dot)]
Down Rosecrans
'87 regal sipping on a gold can
Gun tucked like the fetal, position
Top Dawg coalition coexisting with the coldest you ever quoted from California district
Been a coroner like David Banner I'm the owner
Of the marijuana aroma you're smelling hear the donor yelling "it's me bitches"
Who did it, I did it, take 'em where they can't go
Like planet Venus leaning like a mad scientist
Laboratory bottles of empty Heineken telling stories about the ones that came before me
China-man squinting his eyes because I'm blinding him, my shine is
Bigger than a strike of lightning they liking him because I like to win
Never lose, put me on a pedestal
Bet I pedal victories until I pedal off my shoes
Welcome to the lions room, challenge anybody whom
Wanna try they luck they get fucked up and all you heard was (Oohh)
Say hello to the little big homie, and your reality ain't realer than this homie

[Hook (Ab-Soul) (?)]
Now with my hopes in the back
I could ride like this, or like that
Putting all the bullshit aside
K Dot be too funkified
Tell him he's too cool, bitches
Holla "what it do", bitches
What's cracking bounce, skate, rock, roll, hello, world, here we go

[Verse 2 (K Dot)]
They be crackin' like a pack of sunflowers seeds
That the devil tree, put my dick on your double D, double D's
I learnt that from the dog pound, don't get mad at me
I'm just a product of what was happening in the nineties
Plus my uncle used to fuck with your auntie
Tell me 80 percent ho run in your family
Shame on you, shame on your mother, sister, cousin too
You all produced the same tendencies
While I continue to stack plentl cheese
On my expedition to witness my own odyssey
Out of three, of your favorite bet I give them more flavor like seasoning salt
Call me the Darth Vader invading a raw plot like a space crew, stayed at home
All the gangbangers with the police radars like the Marcus rustle but I hustle
Never change up see my muscle, training like I'm constipated bringing in any drama
If you insist, I'm six for six
Get your ass rolled and twisted, like a blunt rap so fall back
Like winter ended
It's like that (like that?)
Like that (like that?)
Like that (like that?)

[Hook]

[Bridge (K Dot)]
C.O.M.P.T.O.N, that's the city that I live in
I got more drank bitch, bring more friends
Bitch bring more friends
I said C.O.M.P.T.O.N, that's the city that I'm repping
I got more dick bitch, bring more friends
Bitch bring more friends

[Outro (Ab-Soul)]
Ahh, callers, callers call up and um, tell me what you think about that new K Dot record

Aw man I gotta, but anyway man, you Top Dawg niggas crazier than a motherfucker
Ay, who we got on line four?

[Hook]
Now with my hopes in the back
I could ride like this, or like that
Putting all the bullshit aside
K Dot be too funkified
Tell him he's too cool, bitches
Holla "what it do", bitches
What's cracking bounce, skate, rock, roll, hello, world, here we go

[Intro]
"Agh..! Thank you."

You see the world, world, world, feeling you
You see the world, world, world, feeling you
You see the world world, world, feeling—

[Interlude]
"Now, capitalism, of course, can allow for living 

[?]
But they can't create jobs for our people
And they're resorting to fascist techniques more and more
Fascist techniques suppressing our rightful demand
Say nothing of eradicating the individualistic, repetitive racist mentality of people in this country
Only after I feel the distribution of the wealth in this country
Only after we eradicate the exportation of man by man
Can we begin to build a humane society"
You

[Hook]
You see the world, world, world, feeling you
You see the world, world, world, feeling you
You see the world, world, world, feeling you
You see the world, world, world, feeling you
You see the world, world, world, feeling you
You see the world, world, world, feeling—

[Beat Switch]
"The first three expeditions from Mars left Earth in a mushroom of flames."

[Hook]
Life is a butterfly in your hands
Look too close and you may loose it
Life is a butterfly in your hands
Look too close and you may loose it
Life is a butterfly in your hands
Look too close and you may loose it
Life is a butterfly in your hands
Look too close and you may loose it
Life is a butterfly in your hands
Look too close and you may loose it
Life is a butterfly in your hands
Look too close and you may loose it

Watch a nigga shoot like a four-five
They mad at me too, I got more fire
When these bitches see you "Go home, Roger" (Go home, Roger)
Tia and Tamara in my bed, I'm a smart guy
I ain't fucking with you niggas like apartheid
Hits on my list, check my archive
I'm something so immaculate, instead of asking what's happening
Rather blast a Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura
Acting blacker than a Bernie Mac, two Charlie Murphys and Akon
The girls that you brought man, where are they from?
Where are they from?
We were playing Playstation
Why you standing there, say some, girl, say some
No, this ain't a vacation, this is my house, my house

[Chorus (Extended): Childish Gambino & Chance the Rapper]
All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...
All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper & Childish Gambino]
You are the prototype (AK, nigga)
I love you like you love your photo likes
When you post your life
Some of these hoes just wanna Instagram me
You out here trying to win you an Instagrammy
Instant pancakes in the morning
Aunt Jemima try to Andre Benjamin me
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson, but your daughter do dicks
Wouldn't be my old bitch if you taught her new tricks
But she do do the one thing, with her tongue ring
When she bust like a gun range
I had a couple pics, record her out her panties
But, that's just chump change
She the type of bitch that loves to say she's mixed
But when she say the roster she always say "Black last"
You know what it is and you know who it is
I love you with your black ass
You helpless thing
Everything that you did mean everything
You—my bitch did everything
All you needed was some dick, shorty

[Chorus: Childish Gambino & Chance the Rapper]
All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...
All she needed was some... All she needed was some...
All she needed was some...

[Verse 1]
I was at Coachella leanin' on your shoulder
Watchin' your husband swing in time
I guess I was in it 'cause, baby, for a minute
It was Woodstock in my mind
In the next mornin' they put out the warnin'
Tensions were rising over country lines
I turned off the music, tried to sit and use it
All of the love that I saw that night

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause what about all these children
And what about all their parents?
And what about all their crowns they wear
In hair so long like mine?
And what about all their wishes wrapped up like garland roses
Round their little heads?
I said a prayer for a third time

[Chorus]
I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven (A stairway, stairway to heaven)
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (A stairway)
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (A stairway)
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question

[Verse 2]
I was at Coachella leaning on your shoulder
Watching your husband swing and shine
I'd say he was hella cool to win them over
Critics can be so mean sometimes
He was on his knees and I thought he was breaking 'em down
With his words and his voice divine
Doesn't take a genius to know what you've got going
And to not wanna lose it 'cause they lost their minds

[Pre-Chorus]
What about all these children and all their children's children?
And why am I even wondering that today?
Maybe my contribution could be as small as hoping
That words could turn to birds and birds would send my thoughts your way

[Chorus]
I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven (A stairway, stairway to heaven)
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (A stairway)
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (A stairway)
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question

[Outro]
A stairway, stairway to heaven
A stairway
Got a million things I wanna say
Like, what's it all for? Will it be okay?
Million things I wanna say
Like, what's it all for?
Stairway, stairway to heaven
Stairway
Stairway, stairway to heaven
Stairway

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Rock the boat like a one-eyed pirate
Rick James, I get glitter on my eyelids
2 A.M., 85 on the highway
Whole world get a little misguided
Where the spotlight? Put me in the spotlight
Trust no one that put you in the wrong light
High scream when I hit her with the long pipe
Mmm, ice cream when I hit her with the sweet thang
Do my thing, no, I do not do speaking
Get my shot, point it out like Ruth, man
I'ma win a bitch and I got a mood swing
I'm the realest, bitch, now I got a mood swing
I got bipolar confidence
Wake up like "shit" then I feel like the shit
So I guess I'm the shit
Yeah, guess I'm the shit

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann & Merlyn Wood]
Grab life by the horns when I whip the Lambo
Black on red like I whip the sambo
Clip's so long it'll make you mambo
Watch you tango, dutty wine
She grind on my dick like a hundred times
Shawty love me long when I grip her sides
And slip inside like a Slip 'N Slide
My electric eel do electric slide but—
I just wanna feel on the booty
All on me, all on me, all on me
Make it slow clap like Rudy!
All on me, all on me, all on me
I just wanna feel on your booty
Grab the camcorder, we can make it a movie
Bring a friend with you if you like how I do it
Gold chain swingin' and she like how I shoot it

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Merlyn Wood]
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect (Damn)

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Damn, I'm frosty, blood diamond, I'm flossing
Navy camo, I'm drowning, but you don't see what it cost me
Turmoil like the Saudi's, hand-me-downs never fit me
Party never fit me, punani never fit me
Damn, time-travelin', Honda-swervin', that's so Merlyn
That's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn
Damn, time-travelin', Honda-swervin', book learnin'
That's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
Swan dive down the 405
Land at the bottom of El Toro High
With the precision of a cut from a Zoro knife
The boy spit like he made out of 409
So that's clean, bitch
You can't play with my team, bitch
We rock pink now on Wednesdays
Green looks good with your envy
Mix with white 'cause you salty but this stainless
I'm like platinum and it's painless
I just skip on the beat like I'm Pee-Wee Herman
Hands up for all my sermons
My wheel's turnin', now I'm more efficient than ever
I feel like Ratatouille when I'm whipping that cheddar
You see, you better find your thickest of sweaters
'Cause this ice might fuck around and change your whole life
'Cause we about to take flight

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect

[Outro: Joba & Jabari Manwa]
Keep a gold chain (fly, fly as a jet)
I keep a gold chain (fly, fly as a jet)
Keep a gold chain (I said I keep a, gold chain)
Keep a gold chain (I keep a gold chain)
Keep a gold chain (I said I keep a, I said I keep a)
(I keep a gold chain, a gold chain)
Keep a gold chain
(I said I keep a, I keep a)
Keep a gold chain (fly, fly as a jet)
{Intro:]
Yo
I'mma smoke this nigga, man..
What the fuck y'all doin' man? You fuckin' with the jam master
(Time, time for you to die)
As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight)
I ain't fuckin with you niggas, I ain't fuckin with you niggas
This stupid nigga, man
Fuck that
Uh
Yo, yo yo yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo yo yo, yo, yo, yo!

[Verse 1:]
I make yo' mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
When I release, you lose teeth like Lil' Cease
Nigga please, blood floods your dungarees
And that's just the half of my warpath
Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater
Than the average playa hater, and spectators
Buy my CD twice; they see me in the streets
They be like, "Yo he nice, but that's on the low though"
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out fo'-fo's, and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggas, snort 'caine niggas
Extortion came quicker, bought the Range nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be
Til Lil' Cease crippled me
Now I play hard, like my girl's nipples be
The game sour like a pickle be, y'all know da rules
Move from BK to New Jeruz -- thinkin 'bout
All the planes we flew, bitches, we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two
Motherfuckers mad cause I blew, niggas envious
Too many niggas on my dick, shit strenuous
When my men bust, you just move with such stamina
Slugs missed ya, I ain't mad at ya (we ain't mad at ya)
Blood rushin', concussions, ain't nothing
Catch cases, come out fronting, smoking something
Sippin' White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumping
I laced it with the basic, six TVs a system
Knockin' Mase shit, face it, we hard to hit
Guard ya shit, 'fore I stick you, for your re-up
Wipe the pee up, lick shots, woke your seed up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up
Long kiss

[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G. (singing)]
Time, time for you to die (dick-ridin' ass niggas everywhere..)
As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight (there's more than one dick to ride in the rap game) (no doubt, no doubt)
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
What, what, what, what?
I'm flamin' gats, aimin' at, these fucking
Maniacs, put my name in raps, what part the
Game is that? Like they hustle backwards
I smoke Backwoods and Dutchies, you can't touch me
Try to rush me, slugs go, touchy-touchy
You're bleeding lovely, with yo, spirit above me
Or beneath me, your whole life you live sneaky
Now you rest eternally, sleepy, you burn when you creep me
Rest where the worms and the weak be
My nine flies, baptize, rap guys
With the Holy Ghost, I put holes in most
You hold your toast shaky, slippin' tryin' to break me
Look what you made me do, brains blew
My team in the marine-blue, six Coupe
Skeeted out, weeded out, cleanin' out -- the block
For distances, givin' long kisses bitch!

[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G. (singing)]
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Frank White the menacing, Chron-Chron's the medicine
I got the lettuce and, you turn green like cucumber skin
Got the new, Hummer in the summer when I was a new comer
Then, drugs and MAC-10s
Hugs from fake friends, make ends they hate you
Be broke -- girls won't date you
That's why I relate to, choke yo' ass out til your face blue
Make you, open the safe too
No matter how you call it (how you call it)
This brolic, alcoholic
Like his weed green'd out, like his brick solid
Distribute to, kids who, take heart like Valentine
Drink Ballantine, all the time
Slugs hit your chest tap your spine, flatline
Heard through the grapevine, you got fucked fo' times
Damn that three to nine, fucked you up for real though
Sling steel slow, as for remorse, we feel no

[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G. (singing)]
Time, time for you to die
As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight
Time, for you to die
As I kiss.. your.. ass.. goodnight

[Outro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Fuck that!
That nigga tryna be on that up and coming shit, FUCK THAT!
I ain’t the type to toot my horn, but toot toot motherfucker! I’m the nicest nigga in the game, man! Face the motherfucking facts man!
You fuckin' with the other side! You can’t see me! You can’t see me! In a fistfight you won’t SEE me nigga!
Sick of this bullshit
Only reason I ain’t naming no names, is so I don't give these  bitch-ass niggas a chance to make a record coming back just to sell a few units
Faggots!
(we blowin' kisses at you niggas)
Old dirty half-ass niggas, man..
Lyrics from snippet:

[Verse 1]
..and open your mind
Wider than the ocean
Life is 'bout a moment

[Pre-Chorus]
And every single time you wanna give up
Hold on tight to what you love
And don't let go, oh no
And every single time you want a break
Break from your troubles
Take a breath every step

[Chorus]
Let it wash away
Wash away, oh wash away

[Verse 2]
Before the number was the name
March 1st before player was the game
21 years ago, it’s never ever been the same
In all my life I never wanted to play the game
I'm not the same as Michael even though he hall of fame
I'm all hall of faith put me on the wall of change
I got a couple things to learn along the way
Figure out how to mean what I say
I just gotta be me

[Verse 1]
Arm stretch a tee like I nailed it
Raf movin' slow like a creep
Shirt in the breeze like I'm sailin'
And I walk in my sleep, I can't help that (I can't)
When's the last time I asked for some help that
I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?
I couldn't get from nobody out there (I can't)
When's the last time I asked for some help that
I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?
Nobody

[Chorus]
I don't get weak in the knees
Hundreds spread out like a fan
Vert feel like some Gucci sandals
Open the sky, get a handful
Torso marked up like a vandal
How you not fuckin' with cash?
God gave you what you could handle
Gave you what you could handle
I got the grip like the handle
And I'm bikin'
I'm bikin' with me and my Daniel
Hades got the angels
TV's got the angles
I'm brakin'… got…

[Verse 2]
Bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' slow-mo
Maybe the four wheel excitin' us mo'
I'm cold when the temperatures dip below 70s
How can I be burr around L.A. coast?
The diamonds is plural, the Tiffany brooch
On my lapel, at the table, I'm givin' a toast
The first wedding that I've been in my twenties
Thinkin' maybe someone is not somethin' to own
Maybe the government got nothin' to do with it
Thinkin' maybe the feeling just comes and it goes
Think I want me a lil' one that look like my clone
Me and my baby can't do on our own
I landed a trick, got my impossibles
I'm fuckin' with Addy, I'm watchin' my dose
24 hours like they never close
I'm bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' these blocks, yeah
Since Ben Baller sold all his ice up at Slauson, ooh
I'm bikin' uphill and it's burnin' my quads (obstacles)
I'm bikin' downhill and it sound like a fishin' rod
Savage, I'm bikin', yeah

[Verse 3]
Transition lightning (Ascending)
Ashes and remnants of ballers
Body that's gutted
A Bentley that used to be flawless
I'm high up, the raindrops keep falling
Scattered, the showers
Don't scaffold the towers
I'm up, mom, I promise
In class with the honors
No cheat like I'm honest
And how did I become so accomplished?
'Cause I don't see foes (Foes)
I just see a code (Code)
I just see a hole
Chinks in your armor
Like Pac in the Hummer
Like Jigga in summer
Left the house like Obama
Hit the road like a runner
Hit the road like Road Runner
I'm biking, I'm biking, I'm biking

[Chorus]
I don't get weak in the knees
Hundreds spread out like a fan
Vert feel like some Gucci sandals
Open the sky, get a handful
Torso marked up like a vandal
How you not fuckin' with cash?
God gave you what you could handle
Gave you what you could handle
I got the grip like the handle
And I'm bikin'
I'm bikin' with me and my Daniel
Hades got the angels
TV's got the angles
I'm brakin'

[Outro]
Got, got me fucked up
Got a million dollar bike
Got a million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up
Got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up
Got a million dollar bike
Got a million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up
Got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike

[Chorus: Both]
And I got way too many feels, way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real
I just say fuck it, keep on going
And I get deeper, I get deeper, yeah, I feel I'm rolling
I can see you, yeah, I see you
I don't know, I think I'm rolling
Way too many feels, way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real
I just say fuck it, keep on going
And I get deeper, I get deeper, yeah, I think I'm rolling
I can see you, yeah, I see him

And I got way too many feels, way too much emotion
All this Xans inside my body, I say fuck it keep on drowning
You can bring a juice I'll match you
Yeah, you mix it, pour the potion
I don't know who you are, but I'd dive into your ocean
You say you smoking grams, I'm smoking into the Grammys
You say you got them bars, but all I see is candy
You still came through so low-key, think you understand, I don't know me
Still I get along with your best friends, even better with your family

I got way too many feels, way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real

[Verse 2: Olivia O'Brien]
Yeah, way too many feels, way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real
I just say fuck it, keep on going
I got all I need, you don't know what I mean
We pour up 'til we go up
Yeah I got way too many feels, not enough to forfeit
So many fuckin' bands, so you know we finna blow it
I'm faded when I'm sober, sober when I'm faded
Overscrutinized by all your counterparts there's no debating

[Bridge: Rebecca Black & (Olivia O'Brien)]
You say it's cause they jaded, yeah, they jealous that I made it
(Do you remember that first time I missed you in the basement?)
Back when we didn't really know, we were searching for some
(Now they pay full advance, and there ain't no fucking discussion)
At the stage they jumping 'cause it's like that
(You see all these checks and now your girl ain't even write back)
But you drink all my Rose, and you know what to do
(Someone dropped up a dose, so we finna get screwed)

[Outro: Both]
You know I got like way too many feels, way too much emotion
Don't know how to make you feel
But I'm sorry, bitch, I'm rollin'
You know I just drop top in that coup, zoom
Don't know where you been at, true
Now I'm searchin' for who you
Yeah, I'm comin' right back

[Chorus: Both]
And I got way too many feels, way too much emotion
I don't even know what's real
I just say fuck it, keep on going
And I get deeper, I get deeper, yeah, I feel I'm rolling
I can see you, yeah, I see you
I don't know, I think I'm rolling
I got way too many feels, way too many feels
(Yeah, you)

I ran up in that bitch on a rampage, nigga
In the morning, brains in the pancakes, nigga
My bitch classy and she keep her classmates with her
Your bitch ashy and she keep a ashtray with her
Had to do it one time for my skate niggas
Skate up on you, blam-blam, skate away, nigga

I just give my bitch some loot, that shit like pressing mute
I just give my bitch some loot, that shit like pressing mute, yes, Lord
I just give my bitch some loot, that shit like pressing mute
Hoe, shut the fuck up, hoe (Uh)
Hoe, hoe, shut the fuck up, hoe
Hoe, hoe, shut the fuck up, hoe
I just give my bitch some loot, that shit like pressing mute

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
But I ain't got time, to go back and forth with no bitch
What a tangled web we weave, I got arachnophobia bitch
I told her, "Stop tripping," she kept tripping
Same reason I've left women
That's some real shit, bitch don't step in it (Message, alright)
That's an ass, no questions asked
Keep talking, we'll never last
Some of these hoes want a wedding band
Some hoes cool with leather bag
Pop it off, do something for it
Open your mind, I got something for it
Talk is cheep, talk is cheep
And guess what, I can afford it, goddamn

[Bridge: Lil Wayne & Big Sean]
And it ain't trickin if you got it, yeah
Bae if I got it, then you got it, yeah
Bae if I got it, then you got it (Sean Don, G.O.O.D.)
Sellin' all this shit I ain't, you know you got it (I just stopped caring, okay?)
You know you got it (Look)

[Verse 2: Big Sean with Lil Wayne]
Bitch, you better cooperate
I got no patience, but I'm Dr. Paid
So you better get the hell out my face
Talking loud like I really give a fuck what you got to say
You acting high off a line like Dr. J
Respect me like Dr. King
Check looking like a doctor bill, I made a mill
I'm working on another M now like Dr. Dre
Attention to the damn dollar, that's ADD (Oh God)
I never take away, only A-D-D
And I'm making power moves like- Umm
Back, forward, right punch, kick, A-B-B (Hadouken)
A couple of my homies weren't too good at school
Man, they really couldn't crack that ACT
But they could damn sure crack that ADT
It ain't safe in your crib, where the safe in your crib?
She wine fine but I'm Sean Don
Double OG, like Sean Conn
Me and Cash Money records taking over for the nine-nine
If I ain't top ten, stop lying
I spit the verse of the year, like nine times
And I won't let the fuck up
And I'm finna write a novel, called, "Shut the fuck up"
Bitch, quit playing
Wayne I got you

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She say, "But why you got so many" (That's my own business)
I say, "Ooh, do I smell envy?" (Stop hatin', man)
She say, "But why you be so friendly?" (Bitch, mind yo business)
Then she say, "Gimme, gimme, gimme"

[Chorus: Lil Wayne with Big Sean]
Hoe, shut the fuck up, uh
I just give my bitch some loot, that shit like pressing mute
I just give my bitch some loot, that shit like pressing mute, yes, Lord
I just give my bitch some loot, that shit like pressing mute (Fuck wit' em)
(And I wish a nigga would, I wish a nigga would)
Hoe, shut the fuck up, hoe (Huh, money)
Hoe, hoe, shut the fuck up, hoe (Do the money dance)
Hoe, hoe, shut the fuck up, hoe (Do the money dance)
I just give my bitch some loot, that shit like pressing mute (Money dance, yeah)

[Intro]
Ah-em

[Verse]
Baby mama say I ain't shit
Make a nigga feel like shit
Talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, "Dear Life" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me 'til they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, "Dear Life" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave 'em
Where'd I leave it?
I hope I left more of an impression
And all of my blessings for my kids and Miss Cita, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, "You're a son of a gun"
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, "I won't hesitate to fuck a young nigga up", Lord
My new bitch left me
She said she felt too disrespected
It made no sense to me
But not to the people closest to me
And that's why she left
My smile just left
Can't lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin' our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I’ll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is
As it appears, oh shit
There go the tears, there go the drank
There go the pills, you know the drill
Sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times and still here
Why am I here?
Dear Life
What is my reason? What am I here for, that's the question?
My children, that was easy. So easy
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, "Nothing's easy"
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame my lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string
I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but there's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real
The shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill
Lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns
I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tag, no mistake, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, "Fuck the world and be so aggressive. Be so fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive"
I don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious
'Cause if we could buy time every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter

[Refrain]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question
I ask the reader
God bless the reader
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question

[Intro]
Cool N Dre, this is

[Refrain]
It's so simple that it's complicated (Complicated), uh
You think about mistakes, that's when you made 'em (When you made 'em), yeah
The water's runnin', baby, I ain't chasin' (I ain't chasin')
'Cause only in still water we can see our faces (See our faces)
Real shit, I told my nigga

[Verse 1]
"Boy, you better watch them hoes when you sleepin'
Nigga, them dog-ass hoes be creepin'"
I got a few Ms put up for safe keepin'
Long hair, don't care like I was raised in a teepee
Nigga, gun hurt, Nina said she 'bout to go streakin'
Niggas 'bout to go to missin', niggas 'bout to go to deacons
Niggas 'bout to get high as airmen from Tuskegee
Niggas blind to the fact 'cause they don't wan' see me
Niggas don't want talk, niggas don't want reason
Niggas don't want peace, niggas don't know the meanin'
Nigga said, "You're a bitch, nigga," bitch European
Nigga, we Herculean, nigga, skate, surf, or skiin'
Nigga really overseeing, y'all niggas sight seein'
Tomorrow is what a nigga ain't guaranteein'
New Orleans had a sheriff by the name of Harry Lee
And when he died, niggas shouted out, "Tha-thank you, Jesus"
Cruising down the street and I ain't Caribbean
Ain't terrified and I ain't never been
Sippin' H-Town, lookin' like Jeremy Lin
I'm movin' slower than a fuckin' Maryland terrapin
I ain't got time, patience very thin
I will fuck a nigga bride on the day she marry him
I'm a bad Samaritan, I'm a black American
Got white like a fuckin' Aryan, and

[Chorus]
I don't need no pot to piss in, I just need a pot to whip it
I don't need no fuckin' help, I don't need no Scottie Pippen
I don't need a lot of niggas, I just need a chopper, nigga
Graveyard or penitentiary, I keep runnin' out of niggas
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no

[Verse 2]
Now beam me up Scotty
You gon' find your mommy chopped up in a tub
With "Stop snitchin'" written on a note by her body
I picked up your ho and she wore something tiny
I wore something simple, she like that about me
My dope from the '90s, my dope ain't consignment
My coke ain't that diet, I hope you a client
These hoes be relying, these niggas be lying
These niggas who snitchin' we throw to the lions
Ain't no testifyin', you know desert's quiet
So scream until you give your throat laryngitis, we so terrorizin'
You cuddle too much, you choose hoes to confide in
I know where you hide and that ho verified it
I told my homie, "I know where to find him"
He said, "You late, we already got him
And by the way, it was an honor"
That made my day, made me so proud
I bought my bitch some shit from her favorite designer
And a Chihuahua
What's the occasion? Don't worry about it
I don't fuck with snakes except Kobe, the Mamba
Might cut off my hair 'cause these hoes is Delilah's
Let me check my wallet, my pulse and my vitals
Call me the greatest or call me retired
It's up in the air like carbon monoxide
Bitch, we in the buildin', we started from outside
My dick is my third eye and she call it cockeyed
My bath tub lift up, my walls do a 360
She get so wet, it can be sea sickening
Niggas expect some sort of leniency
I'm in high def, but why are you screening me?
I'm Weezy F you, with a sick dick
Hop on my skateboard, do a quick trick
Playin' my role, even with a thick script
Waitin' on a revolution, hope I get a big tip
Smoking on Cee-Lo Green, lighting up a big gift
Every bud get nipped, life is so vibrant and the suns just trip
Anything can happen, put the whats with the ifs
But what's with the ifs?
Just pass that weed like flyin' colors
Light green, teal, turquoise, purple
When I'm in a room, if these walls could talk
I'm sure they'd prefer to be non-verbal
Papa was a rolling stone, worthless
Mama said I wasn't on purpose
That's why I got a ice box where
My heart used to be in this cold world
I'm a monster, a cold blooded monster
I'm colder than fuckin' Moscow, kilos, ounces, GRAMMYs, Oscars
Knock you off your fuckin' high horse
Like a cold-blooded jouster, fightin' for my life
Praying to the ringside announcer

[Refrain]
It's so simple that it's complicated (Complicated), yeah
You think about mistakes, that's when you made 'em (When you made 'em), yeah
The water's runnin', baby, I ain't chasin' (I ain't chasin')
'Cause only in still water's when we see our faces (See our faces)
Real shit, tell 'em

[Chorus]
I don't need no pot to piss in, I just need a pot to whip it
I don't need no fuckin' help, I don't need no Scottie Pippen
I don't need a lot of niggas, I just need that chopper with me
Graveyard or penitentiary, I keep runnin' out of niggas
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no
I don't need a lot of niggas, I just need a chopper with me
Graveyard or penitentiary, I keep runnin' out of niggas
I ain't runnin' out on niggas, no
Now beam me up Scotty (Now beam me up Scotty)

[Verse 1]
Your love is gold
You make me feel alive
Your love is pure
Angel right by my side
You're in my head
Every day, every night
Your love is crimson
February, valentine

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't help it, I just wanna place all of my kisses on your body
I wish that I could hang you in a picture frame and watch you every mornin'
Now I got this feeling, can't forget it, I'm obsessive and I'm sorry
Yeah, you got me good

[Chorus]
Your love is everything, your love is everything (Ah, ah)
Your love is everything, your love is everything (Ah, ah)
Your love is everything, your love is everything (Ah, ah)
Your love is everything, your love is everything
You got me good, your love is everything, your love is everything

[Verse 2]
I just wanna go a hundred miles an hour, love, infinity, it never ends
I just wanna give you all I got, yeah
Are you picking up the messages I'm tryna' send, yeah
I just wanna let you know that I would never let you go, no, no
'Cause you got me good

[Chorus]
Your love is everything, your love is everything (Ah, ah)
Your love is everything, your love is everything (Ah, ah)
Your love is everything, your love is everything (Ah, ah)
Your love is everything, your love is everything
You got me good, your love is everything, your love is everything

[Verse 1]
She don't love you like I love you
She don't touch you like I touch you
You don't trust her like you trusted me
She don't understand the way you feel
I'm not saying that I'm better
I just can't seem to forget you
You don't trust her like you trusted me
I don't understand, why don't you leave?

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish that I could fight the pain, I can't
No, no, no, no

And I fuck you like she never could
Yeah, my promises are promises
And I promise you I'll never leave

[Verse 1]
Hey, tell me baby, are you happy now?
Walking the hallways in your Malibu house
I hope you cleared your head and worked it out
'Cause you were burying our love underground

[Pre-Chorus]
Both made mistakes, you made my heart break
You pushed me underwater, I couldn't breathe
I was gasping for air
Both made mistakes, we started to change
I really hope you're in a better place
'Cause I still really care

[Chorus]
Even though you're no longer mine
You're still on my mind and I hope that you're doing okay (Uh)
Even though we didn't survive, you're still on my mind
You can call me if your feelings change (Whoa-oh)
Even though you're no longer mine
You're still on my mind and I hope that you're doing okay (Uh)
Even though we didn't survive, you're still on my mind
You can call me if your feelings change (Whoa)

[Verse 2]
Hey, tell me baby, did you get it right?
Or do you think about me all through the night
I hope your heavy heart is satisfied
I hope your eyes are sparkling real, real bright

[Pre-Chorus]
Both made mistakes, you made my heart break
You pushed me underwater, I couldn't breathe
I was gasping for air
Both made mistakes, we started to change
I really hope you're in a better place
'Cause I still really care

[Chorus]
Even though you're no longer mine
You're still on my mind and I hope that you're doing okay (Uh)
Even though we didn't survive, you're still on my mind
You can call me if your feelings change (Whoa-oh)

Even though we didn't survive, you're still on my mind

Let me know if you wanna go

So take me home, we'd be incredible
So baby, let me know
Do you wanna go up?
Wanna go, wanna go up
Wan-Wanna go, wanna go up
Wanna go, wanna go up
Do you wanna go up?
Wanna go, wanna go up
Wan-Wanna go, wanna go up
Wanna go, wanna go up
Do you wanna go up?

[Verse 1]
I can't stop thinking about it (Can't stop)
Head in the clouds and the sheets won't wish (One wish, baby)
This club got me feeling like a bad bitch, yeah (Like a bad, bad)
Don't you know I'ma do it like a savage? (Do it, do it)

[Chorus]
Let me know if you wanna go
'Cause I have dreams of me and you alone
So take me home, we'd be incredible
So baby, let me know

I can't stop thinking about it (Can't stop)
Taking my picture, I'ma act like it’s candid (Posted up like oh)
How does it feel to be capturing a bad bitch? (Nah, nah)
Call the elevator, now you're speaking my language (Ooh, yeah)

[Chorus]
Let me know if you wanna go
'Cause I have dreams of me and you alone
So take me home, we'd be incredible

[Verse 1]
Laying in silence
You were a diamond, bright
Yeah, touching my fingertips
Melting into the night, oh
Secrets are locked up
Prison cell in your mind
Kisses fall on her lips
Kisses that should've been mine, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
What you've done, what you've done
What you've done, what you've done
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
Who you love, who you love
Who you love
I know I'm losing you, so come on, tell the truth
Don't you tell me you're sorry, don't pretend you still want me
'Cause I don't wanna know, I already know
What you've done, what you've done
What you've done, what you've done, ooh, ooh
What you've done, what you've done
What you've done, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Fighting the tears back
Fighting to make you stay
Screaming at angels
Holding a wall in my brain, yeah
Secrets are locked up
Prison cell in your heart, yeah
Kisses fall on her lips
The memory's left behind

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
What you've done, what you've done
What you've done, what you've done
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
Who you love, who you love
Who you love
I know I'm losing you, so come on, tell the truth
Don't you tell me you're sorry, don't pretend you still want me
'Cause I don't wanna know, I already know
What you've done, what you've done
What you've done, what you've done, ooh, ooh
What you've done, what you've done
What you've done, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus: October London]
As we go on (We go on)
Like we do (Like we do)
When it's hot outside (Hot outside)
I just wanna chill with you (Chill with you)
What you need? (What you need?)
Is put ya mind at ease (Mind at ease)
Here's a little sun shine, a drink and a summer breeze
Oh! Do-do-do, do-do-do
Let's smoke and ride
Baby if you feel the same, let me know
(If you feel the same, then let me know)
I wanna rock ya, girl (Oh!)
Yes I do!
What you got to lose?

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
You done made it to see a whole 'nother summer and it feel good
Stop, now , top down through the neighborhood
Let the wind blow, open up the window
That girl is poison like Bell Biv Devoe
We have a barbeque to do at four
Swimming pool party in the back on the low
BYOB, and the plates of food will be laid out for free
Little kids get down, I’ll have a bus pull up with Tommy The Clown
Now do The Jerk, get crunk, go to work
And do that dance that'll make your whole damn body hurt
Playing mama dear, calm and clear
This that time of the year
For everybody to be boisterous
Rock with Snoop Dogg and rejoice to this

[Chorus: October London]
As we go on (We go on)
Like we do (Like we do)
When it's hot outside (Hot outside)
I just wanna chill with you (Chill with you)
What you need? (What you need?)
Is put ya mind at ease (Mind at ease)
Here's a little sun shine, a drink and a summer breeze
Oh! Do-do-do, do-do-do
Let's smoke and ride
Baby if you feel the same, let me know
(If you feel the same, then let me know)
I wanna rock ya, girl (Oh!)
Yes I do!
What you got to lose?

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Shined up my white walls, night falls
I'm feeling hella good
I'm doin thangs that you never would
Like surfin with the sharks, or shootin in the dark
Riding on a bike with my grandson at the park
Evolve while I elevate, take flight, levitate
Breakfast for dinner, I'm cold as a mother, but the summer ain't the winter
Finna, bend a, corner, on a three wheel motion
I'm heading to the ocean, caravan full of cars
Neighborhood stars, up and down the boulevard
We go, till we can't go no more
It's me and mines, it's summertime
You go off and we go on

[Chorus: October London]
As we go on (We go on)
Like we do (Like we do)
When it's hot outside (Hot outside)
I just wanna chill with you (Chill with you)
What you need? (What you need?)
Is put ya mind at ease (Mind at ease)
Here's a little sun shine, a drink and a summer breeze
Oh! Do-do-do, do-do-do
Let's smoke and ride
Baby if you feel the same, let me know
(If you feel the same, then let me know)
I wanna rock ya, girl (Oh!)
Yes I do!
What you got to lose?

[Verse 1]
Girls, don't forget your pearls and all of your horses
As you make your way across the pond
Girls, don't forget your curls and all of your corsets
Memorize them in a little song

[Pre-Chorus]
Shake it up, throw your hands up and get loose
Cut a rug, lean into the fuckin' youth
Choreo, we just want the fuckin' truth
(Told by the fake news)

[Chorus]
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
No, it's only the beginnin'
If we hold on to hope, we'll have our happy endin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'

[Verse 2]
Boys, don't forget your toys
And take all of your money
If you find you're in a foreign land
Boys, don't make too much noise
And don't try to be funny
Other people may not understand

[Pre-Chorus]
Shake it up, throw your hands up and get loose
Cut a rug, lean into the fuckin' youth
Choreo, we just want the fuckin' truth
(Told by the fake news)

[Chorus]
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
No, it's only the beginnin'
If we hold on to hope, we'll have our happy endin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'

[Bridge]
And we'll do it again
Oh my God, dizzy from lovin' you
And we'll do it again
Oh my God, dizzy from lovin' you
We'll do it again
Did it from, did it from lovin' you
We'll do it again
In a world at war

[Chorus]
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'

[Outro]
And we'll do it again
And we'll do it again

[Verse 1]
Take me out tonight
Where there's music and there's people
And they're young and alive
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one anymore

[Verse 2]
Take me out tonight
Because I want to see people
And I want to see lights
Driving in your car
Oh, please don't drop me home
Because it's not my home, it's their home
And I'm welcome no more

[Chorus]
And if a double decker bus crashes into us
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten ton truck kills the both of us
To die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

[Verse 3]
Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
And in the darkened underpass
I thought oh God, my chance has come at last
But then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask

[Verse 4]
Take me out tonight
Oh, take me anywhere, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
Driving in your car
I never never want to go home
Because I haven't got one, oh, I haven't got one

[Chorus]
And if a double decker bus crashes into us
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten ton truck kills the both of us
To die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

[Outro]
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out

[Intro]
(Rick Rock)

[Hook: Stresmatic & Snoop Dogg]
I can send a missile
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel
Eyes peeled when I wiggle
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel
This is not a starter pistol (No, no)
I got my head on a swivel, swivel (Yeah)
I got my head on a swivel
If you need me just whistle
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
From the depths of the sea
Blowing trees in the big leagues
I got a plan, I'm going ham on all you DBs
You better double me up, safety cover me up
Single coverage won't work boy, I'll burn him up
Give me the damn ball, move the chains at the same time
Dressed to impress when it's game time, flame mine
I'm wide open, hoping, scoping out the scene
Catch a quick screen, cake walk on your whole team
Will he beam, will he run,  will he walk, talk, or will he lean
I need riders and goons when I build a team
I get it cracking with the snap of the wrist
It's nothing less than a championship, now peep this

[Pre-Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Call a few plays then break the huddle
Check that D, they in the zone no rebuttal
I can throw a strike down the pipe about 80
Hand full of rings, I'm shady like Brady

[Hook: Stressmatic & Snoop Dogg]
I can send a missile
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel
Eyes peeled when I wiggle
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel
This is not a starter pistol (No, no)
I got my head on a swivel, swivel (Yeah)
I got my head on a swivel
If you need me just whistle
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I'm in full beast mode, too cold to be cut down
Lifting weights, staying in shape, won't be shut down
Antonio Brown or Julio Jones
One on each side, now who do you zone
They on me like a bloodhound cause I won't go down
It's like a merry-go-round the way I'm bending my routes
I'm so sick with this, they can't stick me
Stick to to this
Sports Illustrated, get a flick of this
Lost him, cross him, quarterback toss
Highest point homie had the Randy Moss him
One hand as I shook him off me
Some OBJ with a dab of that DJ coffin, get off me

[Pre-Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Call a few plays then break the huddle
Check that D, they in the zone no rebuttal
I can throw a strike down the pipe about 80
Hand full of rings, I'm shady like Brady

[Hook: Stressmatic & Snoop Dogg]
I can send a missile
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel
Eyes peeled when I wiggle

I got my head on a swivel, swivel (Yeah)
I got my head on a swivel
If you need me just whistle
I got my head on a swivel, swivel
I got my head on a swivel

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
If you play wing back, slot end, or receiver
You got to outwork your opponent or you won't receive a
Pass from the quarterback cause he's under pressure
They get a couple 1DB's about to press up
Looking apart from the start, on the dress up
Coach on the play, I'm hoping that he don't mess up
Ayy back up off me, you playing me close
You bout to be hot buttered on a breakfast toast
I rock it out and find my way into the endzone
A couple cheerleaders want to be in my friendzone
I tell 'em "Cool," I keep my head in the game
Cause I'm ahead of the game and I'm a veteran man

[Pre-Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Call a few plays then break the huddle
Check that D, they in the zone no rebuttal
I can throw a strike down the pipe about 80
Hand full of rings, I'm shady like Brady

[Hook: Stressmatic & Snoop Dogg]

[Verse]
I'm writing down my dreams, all I'd like to see
Starting with the bees or else they're gonna die
There will be no trees or air for us to breathe
I start feeling mad, but then I feel inspired
Thinkin' about the days
Coming home with dirty feet from playing with my dad
All day in the creek
He somehow has a way of knowing what to say
So when I'm feeling sad, he makes me feel inspired

[Chorus]
We are meant for more
You're the handle on the door that opens up to change
I know it sounds so strange
To think we are meant for more
You're the handle on the door that opens up the change
I know that sounds so strange
Because you always felt so small, but know you aren't at all
And I hope you feel inspired
Oh, I hope you feel inspired

[Bridge]
How can we escape all the fear and all the hate?
Is anyone watching us down here?
Death is life, it's not a curse
Reminds us of time and what it's worth
To make the most out of it while we're here

[Chorus]
We are meant for more
You're the handle on the door that opens up to change
I know it sounds so strange
We are meant for more
There's a lock upon the door, but we hold the key to change

[Outro]
But how can we escape all the fear and all the hate?
Is anyone watching us down here?

[Chorus]
When your best friend's all strung out
You do everything you can cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
And you find it all around
Well, you say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me
With your feet up in the clouds
Well, oughta know, that I'm here no matter where you wanna go
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

[Verse 1]
Feelings, sleeping in the field again
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel it's beginning to end
Yeah, premonitions smiling in the dark
Well I can see, I can see, I can see the story's starting to arc

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It dries up
I've been a smoking word, I've been a river bed, I've been a rabid force
And let it flow out from within
The trust is that it might affect you for the rest of your life
Yeah, you can control the one, you give, it takes a life
You gotta sleep in your bed, and hope the words will come again
Sometimes it feels like I only dream in black and white
And color's so oh

[Chorus]
When your best friend's all strung out
You do everything you can cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
And you find it all around
Well, you say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me
With your feet up in the clouds
Well, oughta know, that I'm here no matter where you wanna go
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

[Verse 2]
Waits, and fed us slipping into dreams
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel, the celestial beings
Welted pleasures leave you with a breath
I can see, I can see, I can see, the beauty in the mask

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It draws up
I've been a river bed, I tried to salt my wound
I carried more than I can
I feel I got a lot to prove
The trust is that it might affect you for the rest of your life
Yeah, you can control the one, what you got's what you got
You gotta sleep in your bed, and hope the words will come again
Sometimes it feels like I only dream in black and white
And color's so oh

[Chorus]
When your best friend's all strung out
You do everything you can cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
And you find it all around
Well, you say it's what you need and hide your eyes when you're close to me
With your feet up in the clouds
You oughta know, that I'm here no matter where you wanna go
When you're hanging upside down
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

[Bridge]
I'm here
No matter where you are
I'm waiting here
Open arms, no matter where you are
Sometimes you have to wait
It passes by like a satellite, a star
No matter where you are

[Instrumental]

[Refrain]
When your best friend's all strung out
You know when
Oooooh
Oooooh
When your feel up in the clouds
Oh yeah, you know it
Oooooh
Oooooh
When your best friend's all strung out
Oh yeah, you know it
You oughta know, that I'm here no matter where you wanna go
In your head, hanging upside-down
Yeah, you know it
That's how you know when your best friend's all strung out

[Intro]
You know there is always some big mouth-ass nigga talkin' shit. There's always some big mouth motherfucker hatin'. Always a nigga hatin'. It's always somebody that's displeased with what you do. You can never make motherfuckers happy. There is always somebody unsatisfied that feels entitled. There is always some bitch on the sideline talkin' shit with her big mouth There is always some big mouth-ass nigga talkin' 'bout what you shoulda do with your money and what you coulda, woulda, shoulda - it's just... you understand me? Big Mouth with your big mouth ass!

[Hook]
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth

[Verse 1]
There's a rumor being spread about me and my crew
About something we did or supposed to do
You might not of heard it or maybe you have
But when I first heard it all I did was laugh
I used to get angry and all uptight
You can say what you want, just spell my name right
Cause all I'm ever guilty of is rockin' the house
But that's not what the rumor was all about
So if you like to hate tell all your friends
And if you don't wait until you see me again
This way I can hear it from the horses mouth
Right then and there we can straighten it out
Because I don't get involved with he said she said
So take my advice and quit while you ahead
Because one day I just might not laugh
I pull up and pop a cap in your ass

[Hook]
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth

[Verse 2]
People used to say that you got a big mouth
Now I understand what they talking about
Because what we do is just between me and you
Not something that you run and tell your crew
But you had to told Sharon and she told Carol
Then the story rolled on just like a wheelbarrow
Carol told Bibi and she told Pam
And Pam was overheard a-talking to her man
Pam was so rookie, what she thought she heard
And somehow my nigga Diddy Bop got the word
He told somebody I knew from fruit town
They called me up and put me down
Now the whole damn story's been changed around
And that's the reason why I ain't fucking with you now
'Cause you never shoulda opened your mouth at all
And I wouldn't a had no reason to make this call

[Hook]
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth

[Bridge]
Now you're the dime-dropper of the neighborhood
And every time I see you up to no good
Just like a snake rollin' on the ground
Looking for some new dirt to spread around
Now you're the dime-dropper of the neighborhood
And every time I see you up to no good
Just like a snake rollin' on the ground
Looking for some new dirt to spread around

[Hook]
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth

[Skit]
Don't disrespect me. Do not disrespect me. I don't disrespect you niggas, I don't bother you niggas. I get my money the way I do. Leave me alone. I don't disrespect you niggas. Leave me alone. Don't disrespect me. Please, just leave me alone. I'm getting my money the way I do, I'm in my own comfort zone. Leave me alone. Don't disrespect me. Keep to myself, you keep your yourself. Leave me alone

[Verse 1]
Radio, TV, and even the press
They want the meaning of V-A-P-O-R-S
Now the meaning of this word without no doubt
Means nobody wants to be down when you're down and out
Now when you established and got a lot of money
Everybody wants to be your buddy and honey
Like tall buildings they call skyscrapers
(Here comes the vapors)
Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season for catching the vapors
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is tell you how it's spreading throughout my crew
Well you all know Nate Dogg, who sings on my records
"Never Leave Me Alone", "Ain't No Fun", now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg began
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam
The type of female with fly Gucci gear
She had a big herringbone with a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess
Talking about, "Baby please, you out here serving stress"
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her
But now he sport boots that match with his suits
Push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cute
And now she stopped fronting and wants to speak and
Be coming round the Pound every single weekend
To get his beeper number she be begging please
Dying for the day to eat these
She caught the vapors

[Hook]
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

[Verse 2]
I got a little cousin that's calm and plain
He bring the heat with the beat for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow that's laid back
But back in the days he wasn't nothing like that
I remember when he used to scrap every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hanging down with his starks untied
And a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside
Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad
They said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
They said he would grow up to be nothing but a gangster
Or either in jail, or someone would shank him
But now he's grown up to their surprise
D-A-Z got a hit record slanging worldwide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Be like, "Can I burrow a dollar? You a star now."

[Hook]
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

[Verse 3]
I got another homie from tha L-B-C
Known to y'all as DJ Warren G
He cut, scratch, transforms with finesse
{scratching} and all that mess
I remember when we first started to rock
He tried to get this job at Calvin's Record Shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss fronted
Said "Sorry Warren G but there's no help wanted"
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on til the like break of dawn
To work at tha V-I-P would be the lick
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dipped
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is having papers so my homie's like straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like "Warren, welcome to my store"
Offering him a job, but nah he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people up on it
Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they caught since he busting
The vapors

[Hook]
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

[Verse 4]
Last subject of the story is about Snoop Dogg
I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
But since they wasn't trying to hear me I made the Dogg Pound
I saw a crew on 2-1 street and said, "Can I be down champ?"
They said no, and treated me like a wet food stamp
After getting rejected, I ain't run off the set
I sat and wrote some Dogg doo-doo rhymes at my rest
When I used to go to parties, they'd make me wait
Would have to beg to get on the mic to set MCs straight
I ain't never love no hoes I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep on hanging with the juzi
But now things switched from West to East
"Yo dog do you remember me from 21st Street, G?
We used to Cee down back in the day"
It happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed
You caught the vapors

[Hook]
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
He caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

[Skit: Little boy and Kendrick Lamar]
Ayo, K-Dot? You up on that new Snoop Dogg? That nigga shit bang! I ain't fuckin' with none of these new niggas, but that nigga, Snoop Dogg? That nigga back!

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Didn't think I would last, I'm adrift on a draft
While I'm flippin' my craft, hold a gift to the gab
Cre-i-zippin' my rag see, hop on the grass
Peep-pop on these suckers tryna avoid the clash
But if I must I must, let me raise my glass
Tryna move on off and put you on up - some fresh game
Or how to maintain, sustain and gangbang
You never change, you stay the same
It sound easy, don't it? I put a lot on it
I be Dogg on it, I really want it
Achieve at the speed that you work at
And these is the G's we the throwbacks
Battlecat on the track
There is just no way you can call that a comeback
We done that, we run that, from the top back little to the front
We only here to give you what you want
Blaze the blunt!

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When your times is being rough and no one want to be near you (near you)
You know that I'll be there, I'll be right there
And when you're luck is so bad and no one really wants to hear you (hear you)
Just turn me on, and turn me out and let me play
Lada-di-di-di-da-da!

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Horse and a carriage
Sports in a marriage, all in a day's work
Show you how these plays work
Longevity, heavenly blowing kush heavily
Rearrange my melody, no more felonies
Shout-out to my mama Beverly, and my grandmother the elderly should be upheld to the utmost
Dorothy Tate, half the reason why I'm great
Mississippi the state
Let me shake back, right back to the beat
And keep supplying y'all with more heat for the street
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Lion, it's all the same
One thing's for sure, this shit bae
Achieve at the speed that you work at
See these is the G's and we the throwbacks
Battlecat on the track
There is just no way you could call it a comeback
Did that, done that

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When your times is being rough and no one want to be near you (near you)
You know that I'll be there, I'll be right there
And when you're luck is so bad and no one really wants to hear you (hear you)
Just turn me on, and turn me out and let me play
Lada-di-di-di-da-da!

Me llamo Roberto
Este es mi amigo Jabari
Nosotros odiamos a la policía

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
I got pipe dreams of crack rocks and stripper poles
Of fucking centerfolds
So I got secrets only me and all my niggas know
Of kicking in the doors
I’ll send a bitch to get ya, so don’t play fucking stupid
I know you got the product
'Cause I could smell the money, I could taste the weed
Give me somethin' or a body, only way I’ll leave
I love to watch 'em squirm, I love when bitches bleed
If she’s sucking on the barrel, you can’t hear her scream
So kiss the fucking carpet, this aggravated larson
And then I’m out the door, it’s monsters in your home
Black gloves, mask on, muzzle plated chrome

[Chorus: Ameer Vann]
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
That’s the first one to go, the first shot I blow
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Shotta, shotta
Who be that, the number one shotta?
Put a missile on you when I'm on your blocka
It no be thing, no be issue when I'm off it, off it, I'm off it
I got the magazine for the pistol
For any politician talkin' shit, givin' issue
Another black man in the street, it's official
We riding out the spirit, we go another pistol
Huh, fuck—another cracker
Cop comin' on my block for the answers
Huh, I no got time for your question
Huh, this pon' mi mommy and mi bredren

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I hate the way I think, I hate the way it looms
I hate the way the things I say incinerate a room
I know I’m tryna change, but it’ll never work
Just end up more broken down than when I started
And that concrete feels the hardest every time I seem to touch it
Started thinking I ain’t meant for life; but that’s too deep
Falling up into the ceiling while I’m drowning
In the creek of my emotions trying harder to be open
Talking 'bout release dates, I’m trying to make it to tomorrow
Internal honesty could be the hardest pill to swallow
So I need two shots of everything that’s on the fuckin' menu
I’m dancing with myself, setting fire to the venue, motherfucker

[Chorus: Ameer Vann]
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
That’s the first one to go, the first shot I blow
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?

[Bridge: Joba]
Fuck you!
I’ll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you!
I’ll break your neck so you can watch your back
I’ll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you!
I’ll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
My old friend fucked my girlfriend, I should’ve shot him
Pray to God about him, man, I hit the Lotto
Yeah, my bitch got badder, shit, my ass got badder
And I forgave them bitches, so now it’s off to millions
I been fucking sinning, hit the forehead
Chest, left, right, I’m grinning, asses on the ceiling
And I got mirror feelings, for all you lil' demons
Yeah, you see the chain, 'fore all y'all changed on me
Rearranged on me, suck a dick about it
I hope you get offended, and this ain’t clean shit
This is pissing off the yacht with my bitch on me
Wearin' mink on me, sippin' Cris’ on ya
Bet ya life on it, I came to fight for it

[Outro: Matt Champion]
Came in, raided all y'all pockets
And your bitch came in and rubbed up on me
I’m burning rubber, I pulled up on ya

[Hook: x2]

[Hook]

[Jemaine (spoken)]
This song's about love.

[Bret (spoken)]
Yeah.

[Jemaine]
Lives are like retractable pencils

[Bret]
If you push 'em too far, they're gonna break

[Bret (and Jemaine)]
And people are like paper dolls (mmm–mmm)
Mmm, oh yeah

[Jemaine]
Paper dolls and people
They're the very same shape
Mmm, ye-a-ah
{Jemaine and Bret]
Love is like a roll of sellotape

[Jemaine]
Oo-ooh

[Jemaine and Bret]
Real good for makin' two things one

[Jemaine]
But just like that roll of sellotape
Love sometimes breaks off before you're done

[Bret]
Another way that love is similar to sellotape
That I've noticed
Is sometimes, it's hard to see the end

[Jemaine]
Ain't that the truth, my friend?

[Bret (and Jemaine)]
You (search) search 'round the roll (search 'round the roll)
(Yeah, you search 'round the roll) Search 'round the roll (the roll)

[Jemaine and Bret]
With your fingernail
Again and again
And again and again
And again

[Bret]
Doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo-doo-doo!

[Jemaine and Bret]
Brown paper, white paper
Stick it together with sellotape, uh-huh
Ohh-ohh, yeaaahhh, oh

Brown paper, white paper
Stick it together with sellotape of love

[Jemaine]
Ooh-ooh

[Jemaine and Bret]
That sticky stuff

[Jemaine (and Bret)]
(Ohhh!) Come on, come on, baby, now!

[Jemaine (and Bret)]
People, people, paper, paper, paper, paper, people, people
People, people, pencil, pencil, pencil, pencil, paper, paper
Put the pencil to the paper
Give the paper to the people
Let the people read about the sellotape, oh, baby, baby (ooh baby!)
Yeah!

[Bret]
Oh!

[Jemaine (and Bret)}
Ooh ooh (woah-oh) ooh ooh-ooh (oh-woah), oh, (oh!) come on! (woah-oh) come on! (come on!) come on! (yeah!) come on! (whoo!) yeah! (oh-oh) yeah!

[Instrumental interlude, audience laughter]

[Bret (spoken)]
You know, Jemaine, recently, I've, uh, I've been—I've been thinking about love, about mutual love, that sort of love where two... y'know, two people, they love each other equally, like the love you have with, you know, with a loved one, and it's an equal love, and you give love equally, and it's—it's a, it's a feeling that's... it's amazing, it's a sorta... it's probably—you know, it's a wonderful thing. It's love at its best. It's love, y'know, it's, it's, uh, it's, y'know, it's probably the strongest adhesive available.

[Audience laughter]

[Jemaine]
(sighs)

Full on.

Bm-dsh!

[Bret (and Jemaine)]
Bwah! (Oh yeah!) Oooh! (Yeah!) What a feeling! (Whoo-hoo!) Can ya feel it? (Stick it together!) Oh, sticky! (Stick it together!) Yeah, stick it together! (Together, yeah!) Yeah, the really good! (Whoo!) Oh-oh...

{Jemaine and Bret]
Yeah....

[Intro]
I don't belong in the world, that's what it is
Something separates me from other people
Everywhere I turn, there's something blocking my escape

[Verse 1]
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, it's mine
With drippin' peaches, I'm camera-ready
Almost all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
But I still get lonely and, baby, only then
Do I let myself recline
Can I let go, and let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind?
Across the county line

[Chorus]
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin' for somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real

[Verse 2]
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, I'm fine
Past Ventura and lenses plenty
In the white sunshine

[Pre-Chorus]
But you still can find me, if you ask nicely
Underneath the pines
With the daisies, feelin' hazy
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

[Chorus]
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin' for somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real

[Outro]
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
The fact that I can't deal
Locked up for nothing
Stealing or something
In with this kid who seemed
Normal and quiet
I'm playing poker and
He's two cells over
Cops rush the hall, I saw
Blood on the wall

Turns out the kid had a
Few bags of heroin
Deep in his stomach
He swallowed a razor
See I got some stories
Hey, why don't you write that
Into a song maybe?
Your fans will dig that

[Chorus]
You think I don't but I always fucking do
Every time you tell me something untrue
Puts a brick in the wall between me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that you're lying

[Chorus]
You think I don't but I always fucking do
Every time you tell me something untrue
Puts a brick in the wall between me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that you're lying
I
I know that you're lying

[Chorus]
You think I don't but I always fucking do
Every time you tell me something untrue
Puts a brick in the wall between me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that you're lying

[Chorus]
You think I don't but I always fucking do
Every time you tell me something untrue
Puts a brick in the wall between me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that you're lying
I
I know that you're lying
I
I know that you're lying
All the time
I try to recall
What drove you away from here?
What was dream and what was real?
Where was I?

That day meant nothing to me
A hiccup in my memory
This life will leave you hungry
I am completely guilty
Are you guilty?
Are you waiting to be found?
Do you think that you'd be happier
With no one else around?
Are you hiding?
Will the trial never come?
Baby, I've got news-

Is the truth trapped
Behind iron lock and key?
Have you buried all the evidence of
What you used to be?
Has the question
Become darker than the answer?
Baby, I've got news-

[Verse 1]
Davey broke the law again
Heard this time he's going to the pen
Guess I didn't need my lunch
'Cause I was going to miss him a whole bunch
Maybe he was out of line
But he was still a pretty close friend of mine
Maybe he had hurt me bad
But a brother is a brother and that is that

[Verse 2]
Mom's in a mood this week
'Cause she thinks that her family is going crazy
Guess it started with the baby
She went in for a hug, then it bit her on the cheek
That was pretty funny to me
But I guess I should have more sympathy
I never raised a kid
But I bet I'd do a good job if I did

[Verse 3]
Had a dream about a promised land
Walkin' 'round with a big gun in my hand
And when I look you in the eye
You're gonna tell me that you love me and hold me tight
'Cause you know that I have no fear
Ain't gonna walk into the river and disappear
I'm gonna be a powerful man
Red blood running down the broken sand
I couldn't tell you
What it means to me
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
Friday
Saturday
Sunday
Alina, Alina, Alina

Wiping her lips in the
Mirror at lunch
Told teacher felt sick and called
Momma at once
When 'lina got home, she ate
Cinnamon buns, she ate
Rabbits and cats, she ate
Peaches and plums
If I could say, I would say
If I could walk away
If I could talk, I would talk
I'd walk around the block
Look at the way he walks in
Look how he tucks his shirt in
Let me behave in my way

Don't ask me questions, Pa
You know I'm a big old fish now
Don't ask me questions, Pa
You know I'm a big old fish now
You know I'm a big old fish now
You know I'm a big old fish now
You know I'm a big old fish now

Go get your rod
Get my rod
Let's cast 'em off the dock
I caught a big fat monkey
Look at him squirming and jumping
Kill it in time to prepare
Pull out the bones and hair
Now comes my favorite part
Bubbling in the pot

You gotta free 'em you know what I'm sayin'?
Free Jimbo, you know what I'm sayin'?
Free lil' fierce, you know?

Free everybody locked up, even the opps
I wish j-jail or death, I mean, jail or death I wish, no
I don't wish jail on no nigga, even the opp, you dig

[Verse 1]
Do I even got a pulse?
Am I empty? 'Cause I gave my love away
It doesn't seem like you willin' to try
I think we're running out of time now
And I can hear the sirens
And all the caution tape wrapped around my body
Would you rather be happy with another?
Or maybe it's you that's undercover

[Pre-Chorus]
I never thought that you would change my life
I wouldn't have left if I had known the price
Tell me what am I waiting for?
Electric shock won't help no more
Surgery before I fall apart
Get the jumper cables from my car
Baby, I need you to bring me back
Will you bring me back?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm trying not to think at all
I'm slipping, there's no one to catch my fall
And I need you here 'cause you're the air I breathe
And you're the only one for me, baby, you're my oxygen
So please let me breathe again or I'ma flatline

[Verse 2]
I don't know why you won't help me
And I know we argue and we disagree
But the scent of your body, memories of our life
You decide to neglect when the truth is that...

[Pre-Chorus]
I never thought that you would change my life
I wouldn't have left if I had known the price
Tell me what am I waiting for?
Electric shock won't help no more
Surgery before I fall apart
Get the jumper cables from my car
Baby, I need you to bring me back
Will you bring me back?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm trying not to think at all
I'm slipping, there's no one to catch my fall
And I need you here 'cause you're the air I breathe
And you're the only one for me, baby, you're my oxygen
So please let me breathe again or I'ma flatline

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I'm trying not to think at all
I'm slipping, there's no one to catch my fall
And I need you here 'cause you're the air I breathe
And you're the only one for me, baby, you're my oxygen
So please let me breathe again or I'ma flatline
Underneath your gaze I was found in
The haze I'm wandering around in
I am lost in the dark of my own room
And I can't see a thing but the fire in your eyes

Clear my eyes, make me wise
Or is all I believe in lies
I really don't know when or where to go
And I can't see a thing 'til you open my eyes

I've been told by some you'll forget me
The thought doesn't upset me
I am blind to whatever they're saying
And all I can see is the fire in your eyes

Can't believe that it's on your mind
To leave me behind

[Verse 1]
He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

[Chorus]
Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Verse 2]
You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can let me know I'm wanted
Can let me in your head
I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's praise that I'll get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

[Chorus]
Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you the pleasure of heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Bridge]
When we go down right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
Cause you're looking so right there
Baby, you should touch me right there
If you can take me right there
We can make it
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Outro]
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Verse 1]
Love (Yeah), I said real love is like feelin' no fear
When you're standin' in the face of danger (Hey)
'Cause you just want it so much
A touch (Yeah) from your real love
Is like heaven takin' the place of somethin' evil (Hey)
And lettin' it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah (Fuck)

[Chorus]
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces
My cherries (Hey) and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined

[Verse 2]
Love (Yeah), is it real love?
It's like smilin' when the firin' squad's against ya (Hey)
And you just stay lined up, yeah (Fuck)

[Chorus]
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces (Bitch)
My cherries (Hey) and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches (Can I get a fuckin' hallelujah?)
Are ruined (Bitch) (Lookin' at me like a magazine)

[Bridge]
My rose garden dreams (Can I get a fuckin' hallelujah?)
Set on fire by fiends (Sippin' on ya like a Coca-Cola)
And all my black beaches (Can I get a fuckin' hallelujah?)
Are ruined (Lookin' at me like a magazine)
My celluloid scenes (Can I get a fuckin' hallelujah?)
Are torn at the seams (Sippin' on ya like a Coca-Cola, yeah)
And I fall to pieces (Bitch)
(Yeah) I fall to pieces when I'm with you

[Outro]
(Why?) 'Cause I love you so much (Hey)
I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme (Yeah)
And all of my peaches are ruined (Bitch)
Are ruined (Bitch), are ruined (Fuck)

[Intro: T-Pain]
Bitch
Yeah
Been drankin' a little bit
What you wanna say, girl? (Oh yeah)
What you gon' say, girl? (Oh yeah)
Gon' and tell the room, girl (Oh yeah)
Listen, bitch

[Verse: T-Pain]
They call me M.C. Boombox
'Cause when I got a bitch I just boom box
Send her home with no shoes and two socks
Keep the shit real like The Boondocks (Oh yeah)
So call me Teddy McGruder (Oh yeah)
If her nigga act up then I'ma let out the Ruger (Oh yeah)
I done ripped this bitch up, call me Freddy the Kreuger (Oh yeah)
She won't go to sleep, she stay up watchin' me on computers
Damn, she infatuated
Fell in love with my swag and how fast I ate it
But it's not out of the norm when I bring the dick storm
All these bitches be so fascinated and they say (Oh yeah)
Yeah bitch, what you tryna say? (Oh yeah)
What I had you sayin' all day? (Oh yeah)
I got a bitch from New Orleans she said, "Aw yeah"
Said, "Yeah bitch, I know, that's what they all say"

[Intro]
Yeah, you know
I used to think about it as child, like
What would it really be like if I actually got up there
You know, with the stars?
All the fame, laughs

[Verse 1]
Uh, this all started when me and my mama in arguments
Swear we gon' live in apartments
Job offerings would never dance on ahead, like
Feeling like a deer in front of whips without the headlights
Mama cried tears from the trouble with the feds like
Something's stopping this drive, like a red light
I just wanna be more than my mama see
Cause honestly I'm tired of the street crime
Grind every day of the week I, she creeps high
And do whatever I like, like T.I
See, I know I fucked up in the past
And your heart chips breaks like a cup or a glass
But, I'm right here mama
So wipe your tears mama
You would see your nephew a new Nike Airs
I'ma be here 'till I never see tears
And give you that truck that's detailed with each tale
Cop ya a little house on the hill
It's too bad you ain't here
Yeah, I see mama, to the dream, mama, L-U-V mama, R-I-P mama
You probably can't hear me but I miss ya
Cause all you left me with was a picture
Yeah, whatever it seems
It's like your death got a car that drives into my dreams

[Outro: Goapele]
But I'm going higher
Closer to my dreams
I'm going higher and higher
I can almost reach
Sometimes you just have to let it go (let it go)
Leaving all my fears to burn and die
Push them all away so I can move on
Closer to my dreams
Feel it all over my being, in my being
Close your eyes and seek what you believe

[Intro: Young Thug & Starrah]
Yea-ea-ah, oh, yea-ea-ah, ah

[Intro]
Okay
Okay
Okay let's do this
Uh huh

[Verse 1]
Before I spit the verse I'm versed up
I got to take a moment for some ancestor worship
Scott La Rock all day
Ms. Melodie all day
(?) all day
Kwame Toure okay
They watching over KRS today
There's so many ancestors with me
Man watch what you say
You don't even know how I got here
So many dudes are not here
So I do not fear
When the roads is not clear
We are not alarmed with it
(?) in the darkness I'm the spark in it
With every sentence your intelligence I sharpen it
Like a knife or a box cutter you cut the carpet with
Spark that shit
Dudes don't know how deep Chris Parker get
You hear the art I spit
Cause I was at the start of it
The cypher is hyper when KRS is part of it
The same cypher's incomplete when apart from it

Let me make this really clear
They are not us
All these wack twitter rappers I do not trust
They will pull out the gat but they will not bust
They will witness injustice but they will not fuss
They sitting at home thinking they can stop us
I'm flicking ashes on these asses leaving them in the dust dust
Criminal minded
Spiritual minded
Political minded
My lyric you can time it
Watch how I rhyme it
Spit, shine, and grind it
Autograph and sign it
No corporation behind it
Free man, free MC, and free-minded
You looking for authentic and real
Well I'm it

The whole spots hazy but ain't nobody lazy
Blaze me
I'm expressing the talent that God gave me
Divinity
The devil on every level is jittery
No I'm not the average emcee, I'm the epitomy
Think not, come to my spot see my delivery
Then count back thirty years, lyric artillery
People tried to get rid of me, diss me and belittle me
But look a where these people were going
Nowhere quickly
So back to my delivery
I mastered the enemy
When I mastered the inner-me
So what are you telling me
I spit positive energy, the light is sent to me

Enter the dragon, enter the naga, enter the centre-me
KRS is the realest emcee you'll ever see

Yeah they did, and it's obvious why I'm a mess
They couldn't resist

Yeah, I'll do
And you will let me go on and on
It starts on a kiss

[Chorus]
Please let me walk around
Let everyone stare into my soul
Fantasizing
It's fascinating, oh, how everyone needs to be like this
Yeah

[Verse 2]
The craziest part 'bout all of this

[Verse 1]
Do you want to meet after class?
'Cause I really want to
I'll be waiting for you on the field
'Cause I really want to
'Cause I really want to be with you
But I've never had the courage
To ask you to be with me
But trust me, I'm gonna step up my game

[Chorus]
I was going to call you
Going to call you
You didn't pick up your phone
Going to call you
Going to call you
You didn't pick up your phone

[Verse 2]
Do you want to head out at all?
Never really dared to
Way too shy
And we're too young
It's too soon to be playing this game

[Chorus]
I was going to call you
Going to call you
You didn't pick up your phone
Going to call you
Going to call you
You didn't pick up your phone
I was going to call you
Going to call you
You didn't pick up your phone
Going to call you
Going to call you
You never pick up your phone

[Verse]
As you can see, she hasn't met him yet
She already fell in love, I bet
Her keyboard gets slammed by her fingers
But he replies with "okay" every time, every time

[Chorus]
She doesn't know who he is
No, she doesn't know what he's up to, oh
She doesn't know who he is

[Interlude]
(Yeah)

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
He doesn't see her
He sees right through her, oh

[Chorus]
She doesn't know who he is
No, she doesn't know what he's up to, oh
Her heart gets broken every time, every time
She doesn't know who he is
No, she doesn't know what he's up to, oh
She doesn't know who he is
She doesn't know who she is
I'm really tired today
Can't open my eyes, but I'm awake
Smashed a guitar into the ground
It slipped through my hands
This day sucks, just a bit

I'm really tired today
This day sucks
It sucks just a bit

[Verse 1]
My thoughts mixed up
You don't seem to bother
Are you blind or just tired
Of everything that has been going on
Lately I'm sorry
Maybe I shouldn't try
To be the guy who solves your problems
Problems

[Chorus]
Right place, wrong time
Is what she said to me
These days gone to waste
Is what we're left with
Right place, wrong time
Is what she said to me
These days gone to waste
Is what we're left with

[Verse 2]
My thoughts mix up
You never seem to bother
Are you blind or just tired
Of everything that has been going on
Lately you say you're not ready
But will you ever be ready?
Ready, are you ready?
Will you ever be ready?

[Chorus]
Right place, wrong time
Is what she said to me
These days gone to waste
Is what we're left with
Right place, wrong time
Is what she said to me
These days gone to waste
Is what we're left with
'Cause I know it's you
When my phone rings at night
Let's get away from here
There's this house we could share
Let's find a car and drive it away
Get away today
Let's get away from here
There's this house we could share
A beach house
Where the sound of flip flops and ocean
Is all you can hear
Come on, come on
Let's get away from here

[Pre-Chorus: Aminé]
With my niggas in my red Mercedes
Attitude like fuck you, pay me

Cab radio screaming
Noise and tears
Death on the TV
And then there's you
Messed up, it's crazy
I can't concentrate
I just see your outline...
Mhmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Back where we left off
Watch you take your dress off
I've been by myself remembering you
Your body hurts me
Loopin' 'round like CCTV
In all this bitterness, you stay so sweet

[Chorus]
Such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl
Uh, it's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl
Uh-uh-uh-uh

[Verse 2]
Some prick at the party
All scripts and boasts
A dead eyed actress girl
And then there's you
Venus in Converse
You put a spell on me
And you're lockin' up the bathroom door for us

[Pre-Chorus]
Back where we left off
Watch you take your dress off
I've been by myself remembering you
Your body hurts me
Loopin' 'round like CCTV
In all this bitterness, you stay so sweet

[Chorus]
Such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl
Uh, it's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl

[Breakdown]
It's such a cruel world
Hey, hey, hey
It's such a cruel world
Hey, hey, hey

Sunrise in Hollywood
We ain't slept for days
Perfect disaster

It's such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl
Uh, it's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl

Maybe I found somethin' good, girl
Uh-uh-uh-uh

[Outro]
Sunrise in Hollywood
We ain't slept for days

[Verse 1]
I was walking through icy streams
That took my breath away
Moving slowly through westward water
Over glacial plains

[Pre-Chorus]
And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me, oh my, I thought it was a dream
So it seemed

[Chorus]
And now, breathe deep
I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Leave me be
I'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Cut my hair so I could rock back and forth
Without thinking of you
Learned to talk and say
Whatever, ever, whatever, whatever, ever
I wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh, oh me, oh my, I thought it was a dream
So it seemed

[Chorus]
And now, breathe deep
I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Leave me be
I'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
You and I, there's air in between
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You and I, there's air in between

[Verse 1]
Washed out with the rain
But I’d do it again
Trade in your blues
For a better view
I know, I know, I know it’s a dismal game we play
I know, I know, I know you’re testing me
Testing me
You're testing me
You're testing me

[Verse 2]
Sleep off the pain
And try again
Blackout your eyes
With a better high
I know, I know about the twisted rites you hide behind
I know, I know, I know you’re testing me
You're testing me
You're testing me
Lord, you're testing me

[Verse 3]
Rip off the veil
Of this hellish tale
Slip through the back streets
And cover up your trail
I know, I know, I know it’s the vague and dark you’re drawn to
I know, I know, I know you’re testing me
You're testing me
You're testing me
Lord, you're testing me

[Intro]
Doin' it right
On the weird night

[Verse 1]
Between 3 and 6 when my big ideas hit
Green freeways, green freeways, driving fast, at last
It's hard to be fake with nobody else awake
I can live how I live, baby, hanging hard, working hard

[Pre-Chorus]
Not midnight
Not sunrise

So in touch, that's the best, send that girl a risky text
Thrill seeking, gland squeezing, give your life meaning
That spot on the clock when the world can't throw you off

[Pre-Chorus]
Not midnight
Not sunrise
Yeah!

In the weird part of the night, yeah
That's the time I feel alright, yeah
All the bullshit goes away, oh yeah

And you will kiss the ring

[Verse 1]
As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do
So I stopped and got out
And looked down, I noticed I'd got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find, what I can fix
I looked around there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange, feeling like a mist
I walked down toward the end of a road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said, "Don't you worry my friend
I'll take care, take my hand
I'll take you there"

[Chorus]
Ooh-oh-oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

[Verse 2]
As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
A'Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and a'smilin' an' Nothin' to fear
She said, "This is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness"
She turned around, looked down
In my eyes and started cryin'
And grabbed my hand
You've got a friend
Ohh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Take me to a place without no name
(No name)
Take me to a place without no name
(A place without no name)
Take me to a place (Take me) without no name
(Take me, take me, a place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name
Woh-oh-oh
Yeah, doggone, oh-oh

[Verse 3]
She started likin' me
Kissin' me, and huggin' me
She didn't really really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen
And things I've never done
This really looks like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass and the skies and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world, could I wanna leave

[Pre-Chorus]
So then I went in my pocket
Took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought
You could be in another world

[Chorus]
Oh oh-oh
Take me to a place without no name
(Doggone, take me, no name)
(Take me to a place without no name)
Nah nah nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah nah nah
(A place without no name)
(Take me, doggone, a place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name
No no no!

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Hello August moon, where are the stars of the night?
You promised me too soon cause it's been cloudy all night
And the weatherman said, if you're not well stay in bed
And I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home instead

[Chorus 1]
But I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do

[Verse 2]
Hello midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of ya 'til the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish and then we'll kiss, our love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you

[Chorus 2]
And I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do

[Bridge]
It seems you don't know, we reached the highest mountain
Every time I seem to disappear
And together we will fly, we'll dance up in the heavens
I can really feel it when you're near, oh-hooo
And the weatherman said, if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home in bed

[Outro]
But I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do (N'doo doo doo, I'll be loving you)
Loving you, that's what I wanna do ('Cause you're always on my mind)
Loving you, that's what I wanna do (N'doo doo doo, loving you)
Loving you, that's what I wanna do (Always on my mind)
Loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you

[Verse 1]
Father comes home from work, and he's scared to death
Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table, he says "What's going on?"
Mother cries desperately, "Our little baby's gone!"

[Chorus]
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

[Verse 2]
She wrote that she is tired of step daddy using her
Saying that he'll buy 'er things, while sexually abusin' 'er
Just think that she's all alone somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive? She ain't got nothin' to eat

[Chorus]
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

[Bridge]
Save me (from this living hell)
Save me (cause I, I wanna help)
Save me (I'm tired and I'm mad)
Save me (cause this, it ain't no joke)
Save me (cause I'm out for blood)
Save me (cause I don't wanna ignore)
Save me (it's time I replied)
Save me (uh-uh)
Save me (hee-hee)

[Verse 3]
Now she's on the move, she's off ta Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, a man is waiting there
"I'll show you where the money is, girl just let down your hair"
He is takin' her on the streets, of Sunset Boulevard
She's sellin' her body, hah, girl that will take you far
The police come 'round the corner, somebody there told
He's arresting this little girl, she's only 12 years old

[Chorus]
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now 12 o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, I was on that corner, tryna get my coins up
Coppers run up on us and we turn to Jackie Joyner
White man kill a black man, they never report us
Black man kill a white man, they gon' start a war up
Mama she was tore up, sippin' on the Absolut
Young niggas brainwashed, they just wanna rap and hoop
Could've been a lawyer until they came and shackled you
Felons on your records so them jobs ain't gettin' back at you
Them kids ain't eat yet, so you can't even sleep yet
If that's the only thing we ever saw, we repeat that
They was playing ball, fouled him hard, said I'd be back
Broad day, threw his life away, soon as he clapped
Gave that boy a life sentence, made his momma relapse
Damn, they don't understand
Comin' from the bottom, it's so hard to make a plan
Know them kids beefin', they let it get out of hand
OGs never told us nothin' in advance
Young niggas killing young niggas, shit is like the Klan, I said
Told my young nigga, "You the man," I said
You don't wanna end up like my man Ahmed
Praying five times a day, prostration on his head
Screamin'  insha'Allah that he don't make it to the feds
Caught up in the system, visit from his sister
Talkin' 'bout all his niggas, how they ain't even with him
Said they would ride or die, but it ain't even in 'em
Always postin' on the 'Gram, but they ain't sendin' pictures
Never answer when you call, but answer for them bitches
Got you thinking twice,  damn I should've been a witness
That’s none of my business, just telling my story
All guns, no glory, been going on before me
Were slaves in the '40s, still slaves in the present
No toys for Christmas, ain't get us no presents
Only made us evil, made us hungry, made us desperate
Youngin' in the 9th grade, he got a Smith and Wesson
Grew up with the goons, now he need protection
He dropped outta school, then he got arrested
Lord with a blessing, I just hope he learned his lesson
They told us, if we go to jail, we would be respected
They told us, if we make a sale, we would run a check in
Threw a rock out in that field, we got intercepted
He stumbled, he fumbled, y'all niggas just rumble
They told you to hustle, them niggas don't love you

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
Young black American, na na
Wanna live like the fairer skin, na na
Fall to the paradigm, na na
Occupied on that Marilyn, na na
The prophecies of the wild nigga, no church
My uncles said stop bitching nigga, no skirts
It's kinda crazy there's another world
On the other side of town
Pastor rollin' up in that Rolls, pullin' up in that Holy Ghost
Preaching, while niggas dying by the Bible code
The destruction, the hate
The obstruction of my faith
My prayers, my faith
Will never be the same

[Outro: The-Dream]
Young black America
Young black America
Young black America
Young black America
Young black America
Young black America
Young black America
Young black America
Young black America
Young black America
Young black America
Young black America

Five bands, Gucci coat, rock it once

[Verse 3: Lil Uzi Vert]
(Huh, yeah!) Gucci swag so relaxed

Damn, thought I wasn't, fuck you then hit your cousin

Stop hatin', fuck nigga get money
Fuck your bitch, hit it once
Ain't my type, give her back, uh
My Rarri, no keys like vroom

Yeah, I put all of them guap in the front
Yeah, my engine in the back
Little nigga we don't talk about nothing
If that shit not 'bout the racks
Don't call my phone, don't leave no message
But that girl was swerving me, diamonds emergency

Up all night, don't rest much
Spent two hunnid put the rest up
Young nigga fuck that check up

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Fuck that check up (fuck that check up)

[Verse 1]
Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I will never be alone
And you my friend will see
You've got a friend in me

[Verse 2]
Ben, you're always running here and there
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There is something you should know
You have got a place to go

[Verse 3]
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it is "us", now it is "we"
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it is "us", now it is "we"

[Verse 4]
Ben, most people would turn you away
I don't listen to a word they say
They do not see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I am sure they did think again
If they had a friend like Ben
Like Ben
Like Ben

[Verse 1]
I'm sitting alone
Nobody to hold
The people in here are crazy
Faking a smile now
Been here for a while now
I'm fed up with this
I just wanna go home
But damn, that girl
Set me up with her

[Chorus]
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, baby, let's get lost right here
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, babe, under the chandelier
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, baby
Don't turn me down for him
What does he have that I can't give to you, girl?

[Verse 2]
I can't understand this
This guy's just a douchebag
I'm so disappointed in myself (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
The look on her face says
I hope we go places
I'm left alone
Should've stayed at home
And searched how to date on Chrome

[Chorus]
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, baby, let's get lost right here
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, babe, under the chandelier
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, baby
Don't turn me down for him
What does he have that I can't give to you, girl

[Bridge]
I'm sitting alone

[Outro]
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, baby, let's get lost right here
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, babe, under the chandelier
Dance with me, baby
Dance with me, baby
What does he have that I don't?
I could give the world to you if you turned him down for me

[Intro]
Oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah

[Refrain]
Woke up this mornin'
Lookin' there over the dawn of light
Things now for me are not what they used to be
I had many a friend
I had many a friend up until the end
But now everyone's gone and I'll live on
In a family

[Chorus]
Yeah, sister gets
Yeah, yeah she do
Sister gets
Sure do, yeah
Sister gets
Yeah
Sister gets

[Verse]
Oh, yeah
Now everyone knows
They know the way, the way that it goes
It's like girl lock it up
Go on and ra—raise a family
That's what they tell me
They tell me, they tell me
I may not be fit, no
But I ain't no, I ain't nobody's hypocrite, yeah
If I find me a good reason, it would be so, so good, pleasin'

[Chorus]
Sister gets
Yeah she do
Sister gets
Sure do
Sister gets
Yeah, huh
Sister gets
Yeah, she do

[Bridge]
Lord help me now
Yeah

[Chorus]
Sister gets
Yeah
Sister gets

Sister gets
Yeah

[?], uh

[Refrain]
I woke up this mornin'
Lookin' there over the dawn of light
And things now for me are not what they used to be, yeah
I had many friends
Many friends up until the end
Oh, but everyone's gone and I'll live on
In a family

Looking good and feeling fine

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
Fashion
Step into the room like it's a catwalk
Fashion
Singing to the tune, just to keep them talking
Fashion
Walk into the light
Display your diamonds and pearls in light
Fashion
Married to the night
I own the world, we own the world

[Chorus: Lady Gaga + RuPaul]
Look at me now

[Muppets Outro]
Now I've seen everything!
Good, then we can leave

[Verse 1]
Meet me glassy-eyed, blind, and divine
Hold down the fort on the coastline
The castle is a pimple on the face of our orb
A humble spot for clues to drop if you eavesdrop

[Verse 2]
I see through the bricks, to the sea, crumbling castle
Water's rising up, thick and green, crumbling castle
Inching closer each century, crumbling castle
Are we safe in our citadel?

[Chorus 1]
Look upon our condition, crumbling castle
You would not believe where I'm from, crumbling castle

[Verse 3]
We wait for the death, that does not come, crumbling castle
Dug all the holes in God's Acre, crumbling castle
We have even said our last rites, crumbling castle
Are we safe in our holding cell?

[Chorus 1]
Look upon our condition, crumbling castle
We head to our extinction, crumbling castle

[Verse 4]
The sounds of the constant lightning
Would be enough to block out
The thought of the end of the world
If it were not for our tinnitus from the bomb

[Verse 5]
In the wind I sway, back and forth
I'm brittle as an aged human being
Where my walls are safe from wild weather
The filth forms into great nastiness
Polygondwanaland

[Chorus 2]
I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle

[Verse 6]
I don't want to fall into dust
I don't want nothing but to live on
The ache inside my keep spurs me on
I don't want to be invisible
Polygondwanaland

[Chorus 2]
I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle

[Verse 7]
On this very day, in one thousand years
The earth will be relative to the sun and the moon
And a new world will be created
I know because it is written here

[Verse 2]
I see through the bricks to the sea, crumbling castle
Inching closer each century, crumbling castle
Water's rising up, thick and green, crumbling castle
Are we safe in our citadel?

[Chorus 1]
Look upon our condition, crumbling castle
You would not believe where I'm from, crumbling castle

[Outro]
I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle

[Verse 1]
I've thought about it every day now
And taking you for granted is going to change now
I can't believe I left you up waiting
Will you forgive me although I've forsaken

[Chorus]
All of you
All of you
All of you

[Verse 2]
Here's to you dear let's do what you want to
Put my mind downstairs, let's go for a ride
Look into the mirror while I drink your nectar
A couple days later it's never felt better

[Chorus]
With all of you
All of you
All of you
All of you

[Verse 1]
Swallow me
Swallow me
And open up

[Bridge 1]
Let me inside of your mind
I'll live inside of you to find what you're looking for

[Chorus]
Tell me about it
Tell me about it
Tell me about it

[Verse 2]
Needy bee
Whispers softly
Tell me what you need

[Bridge 2]
I'll come inside of you
I'll live inside of you to find what you're looking for

[Chorus]
Tell me about it
Tell me about it
Tell me about it
It's been twenty some odd years
Since you brought me here
You brought me here
You brought me here

You are my creator
You gave me life
You gave me water
You gave me life
You could take it if you want to

You brought me here, you could take me out
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

It's been twenty some odd years
Since you brought me here
Since you brought me here

You are my creator
You are my creator
You gave me life
You gave me water

[Refrain]
It's been years since you came around these parts of my mind
All I can recall is you restin' naked every time
You handcuffed yourself to your mother's bed that one night
You left the front door unlocked waiting for me to arrive home

[Chorus 1]
I learned all about lust
Dominatrix, always thinking about myself
I used to wonder what I'd do without you

[Verse]
It's been years now and you embrace all my vices without shame
It's a beautiful world
The hips and levers tie me up in your room
I am grateful I found a lover, a queen
That shines right through the gloom
It's a beautiful world
The hips and levers tied me up in your room

[Chorus 2]
She taught me to make love
With patience
Not just thinkin' about myself

[Verse 2]
You really feel the other person
Oh my lover
What will I do without you?
And I wonder
What I'd do without you

[Bridge]
The woman that taught me love
Lays in front of me every morning

[Refrain]
It's been years since you came around to these parts of my mind
All I can recall is you restin' naked every time
You handcuffed to yourself to your mother's bed that one night
You left the front door unlocked waiting for me to arrive

[Verse]
I used to play the fool all by myself
It used to make me feel real good
I used to eat my food all by myself
I used to do the dishes too
I used to break your heart all by myself
I used to be the only one around

[Hook 1]
Be yourself, there's no understanding something that happened that night
Be yourself, there's no understanding, no no no
There is no understanding, no

[Guitar Solo]

[Hook 2]
Be yourself, there's no understanding something that happened that night
Be yourself, there's no understanding, no
There is no understanding
Be yourself, there's no understanding, no
No understanding what happened that night, baby
Be yourself, there's no understanding, no
Oh, there is no
With you, with you
Oh my dear
Oh my dear
It's clear time is of waste now

I miss you
Yes, I miss you
I know why
Time stands slow in here
Oh, let me show you
Oh I miss you
Yes, I missed you

I saw
I saw 

[? 2:42]
Oh, I can't help myself

I miss you
Yes, I miss you
I left you

I love that song 

[? 3:06]
Where does this take away?
Oh, I miss you
Yes, I miss you

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
Blue is the color of the planet from the view above
Long live our reign, long live our love
Green is the planet from the eyes of a turtle dove
'Til it runs red, runs red with blood

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
We get so tired and we complain
'Bout how it's hard to live
It's more than just a video game

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
But we gotta try (Lie-la-lie)
Every day and night (Lie-la-lie)

[Verse 2: Stevie Nicks]
Blue is the collar of the shirt of the man I love
He's hard at work, hard to the touch
But warm is the body of the girl from the land he loves
My heart is soft, my past is rough

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Lana Del Rey & Stevie Nicks]
But when I love him, get a feeling
Something close to like a sugar rush
It runs through me, but is it wasted love?
(It's not wasted love)

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Stevie Nicks, Lana Del Rey & Stevie Nicks]
But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
But we gotta try (Lie-la-lie)
Every day and night (Lie-la-lie)

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey, Lana Del Rey & Stevie Nicks]
Yeah we've gotta try (Lie-la-lie)
We gotta walk through fire (Lie-la-lie)
Because we're just

[Chorus: Stevie Nicks, Lana Del Rey & Stevie Nicks]
Beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
(We're just)
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
(Beautiful people)
Beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
(We're just)
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them

[Outro: Lana Del Rey & Stevie Nicks]
So beautiful
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Intro]
You gotta smoke one to this
Yeah, you gotta light one
If you don't it's cool
But if you do...
You're way cooler

[Verse 1]
Uh, Versace on my dishes
Armani on my slippers
How do we smoke all this weed
Still handle all this business
A major key to success, is watch the competition
I move discrete as I can
Roll up without permission
Most of these niggas is hoes
Do anything for status
No real talent, just part of an Instagram challenge
Niggas is squares, a movie cast full of bad actors
Don't let the media fool you, these niggas movin backwards
I'm tryna stay as far away from lames as possible
They hardly mention my name, but
Know they watchin' though
Lost my brother this year
One thing it taught me though
Is that I'm built to win no matter the obstacle
Make sure my team is in order
Still got new crops to grow
3 million on settlements
But God got me though
I learned so many new things
And got a lot to show
Now we don't go anywhere without an ounce to blow
No summer tour this year, I'm doing festivals
I took a lil time off so that my neck could grow
Still writing checks and dressing the best head to toe
What you expect in the presence of a professional?
Nothing less, we smoke the best
A new strain? I might invest

[Chorus]
I stay stoned, I stay stoned
Cause weed is legal (weed is legal)
Let's get higher, up to the ceiling, ooh
I stay stoned, I stay stoned
Cause weed is legal (weed is legal)
Bitch don't you blow my high, ohh

[Verse 1]
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the truth's in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 2]
You've been so unavailable
And sadly, I know why
Your heart is unattainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Bridge]
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realise my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Outro]
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one

[Intro]
I'm on it
I just love co-ed baby showers

[Chrous]
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse]
I got friends and that's a fact
Like Zoe, Junior, Diane, and Jack
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me
So we started talkin', gettin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time so we can build up
On a Monday, I was arrested (uh huh)
On a Tuesday, they locked me in the jail (oh boy)
On a Wednesday, my trial was attested
On a Thursday, they said guilty and the Judge's gavel fell

I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
I got chains, chains around my feet
I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
And them chains, them chains
They're about to drag me down

On a Monday, my momma come to see me
On a Tuesday, they caught me with a file
On a Wednesday, I'm down in solitary
On a Thursday, I start on bread and water for a while

I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
I got chains, chains around my feet
I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
And them chains, them chains
They're about to drag me down
I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
I got chains, chains around my feet
I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
And them chains, them chains
They're about to drag me down

Hey, this microphone's got a screw loose here
Somebody come screw this microphone?
What I say?
Just a minute, lemme fix this son of alright

[Chorus: Lihtz Kamraz]
I give a fuck what you feel like (You feel)

Flood the rollie, tryna kill time (Kill)

I will never lose, I will never lose

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I've been through hell and back
Started off broke, lost it all, and I bring it back
Talking before the rap, on the corner, was selling crack
Where was the fuck you at? (Where?)
Make sure you tell 'em that (Tell 'em)
Left on your B-day, I said that I ain't coming back
'Cause you stay where them suckers at
I'm too real for that fake shit, you know I can't fuck with that
I could never lose, went and bought some better jewels
Mansion on the hills, with the better views
They was never real, bet they bet I lose
Tell 'em how you feel
Niggas sleeping on me, tell 'em let 'em snooze
When we see them niggas, treat them like they fools
Ayo with the Draco with the half a moon
Everytime I look up, I be in the news
Talking 'bout some shit I probably didn't do
All this controversy I done been through
It can never hurt me if it never murk me
Rest in piece to Snupe, Scooter, and Truz
Know the typa shit that I'm really into
I done put out lil Chino in a Benz too
I'm the motivation for them trenches too
Tell 'em bring up somethin' that I didn't do

[Bridge: Meek Mill]
Wins and them losses, turned us to bosses (Turned us to bosses)
Yeah, when them niggas started hating, man that's when they lost us
Yeah, I  seen their bitches switchin' sides soon as they cross us
Fuck 'em
But I never trip and I feel like that bull, I'm a Taurus (Love 'em)

[Chorus: Lihtz Kamraz]
I give a fuck what you feel like (You feel)
I'm real that's in real life (Oh my)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I will never lose (Yeah)
I will never lose
I will never lose
I will never lose, I will never lose
I will never lose
I will never lose, I will never lose

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yeah, they put my back to the wall
I done seen all this shit happen before
I can't forget that I came from the bottom
But if I look back, I might happen to fall
Started out trapping, was packing that rock
We was trapping that raw
Thirty six O make it back like a boss
I seen they left, they all thought that I lost
Soon as I win, they all clapped and applaud
I seen my dawgs turned their backs, it was slow
I seen that bitch turn her back like a fraud
You turn your back, you can't come back no more
Shown the real monster, just cuttin' them off
Just when they thought, they was laughing at me
I was just sittin' back laughin' at y'all
From battlin' with Reed to rapping with Ross
To bagging famous bitches at the awards
Rags to riches on the tag of the car
Swap the wraith and go and grab me the Dawn
Flood the Patek, let it wrap around my arm
Load the ladder like we ready for war
And all of the energy, they gon' remember me after I'm gone
Still while I'm here nigga, I'm puttin' on
Roll with no fear, I just roll with the storm

[Chorus: Lihtz Kamraz]
I give a fuck what you feel like (You feel)
I'm real that's in real life (Oh my)
Flood the rollie, tryna kill time (Kill)
Close your eyes and I will still shining (Shine)
My bitch tryna play me, she crazy (She crazy)
I'm fucking models on the daily (Ooh)
Anyway a nigga choose, I will never lose, I will never lose
I will never lose (Nah)
I will never lose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I will never lose (Yeah)
I will never lose
I will never lose
I will never lose, I will never lose
I will never lose
I will never lose, I will never lose

[Verse 1: Aminé & Kehlani]
I got the baddest bitch
Shorty keep hollerin’ at me
Told her I’m a young OG from the west
And I’m repping up the 503
I ain’t no average bitch
Baby come swing my way
Imma put you on this game
Get it all gas no breaks (skrrt)

[Pre-Chorus: Aminé & Kehlani / Kehlani]
Just for you I might jeopardize
My whole life I might sacrifice
Way you look is like woah (woah)
Got me locked and I’m hypnotized
Shakira-like and these hips don’t lie
Say I don’t but I always try
Way you look is like woah
Got me locked and I’m hypnotized

[Chorus: Aminé & Kehlani]
You, you got so much potential
Every moment spent with you
I bet was always eventful
I've never seen your type of species
Give me heebiejeebies

Attitude Khaleesi
Woah, and I’m like woah, woah, woah

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Don’t you know you’re something else?
Don’t you know that there’s no one else?
Must I remind you?
Real ones behind you
Don’t look, I’m gonna find you

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
So, just for you I might jeopardize
My whole life I might sacrifice
Baby got me like woah
Hypnotize ‘em like woah
Shakira-like and these hips don’t lie
Say I don’t but I always try
Cause baby lookin’ like woah
Woah…

[Chorus: Aminé & Kehlani]
You, you got so much potential
Every moment spent with you

Give me heebiejeebies
Attitude Khaleesi
Woah, and I’m like woah, woah, woah

[Verse 3: Aminé]
Took my time, now I start to see signs
In too deep now I can’t rewind
Lil mama she gonna work out
When she do the Bowflex then we have more sex
Sweat, drippin, now I wanna kick it
Cheated on you with some dumb bum bitches
Your momma wouldn’t be too proud
Girl we in public, don’t be too loud
Sugar pie, Aminé never tell no lies
Love and lust it’s just both of us
I’d rather talk to you to get by
I don’t really play no games
Unless it’s with my friends and we playing 2k
Baby I'm on one, I'm here for the long run (with you)

[Chorus: Aminé & Kehlani]
You, you got so much potential
Every moment spent with you
I bet was always eventful
I've never seen your type of species

You, you got so much potential
Every moment spent with you
I bet was always eventful
I've never seen your type of species
Give me heebiejeebies
Attitude Khaleesi
Woah, and I’m like woah, woah, woah

[Verse 1]
"Gonna break your hand"
Tell me not to fight anymore
'Cause I feel yellow as a coward
Pale as a flickering bulb
Outside of a liquor store
So knock me out again
Count backwards from ten
As I relay the colors as they appear to me
From the bottom of a cement floor

[Chorus]
And do you see
Me
'Cause oh how far do you think I can go
Beneath before you won't follow me there

[Verse 2]
You don't understand
I know the last time I swore
Not to make a scene and now I'm wandering into traffic screaming
To set me on fire in the middle of the street
Bend my knees and paint the concrete
The color of my bloody knuckles
Pulling splinters from the chapel door

[Chorus]
And do you see
Me
Anymore
Oh how far do you think I can go
Beneath before you won't follow
Down to the center of a black hole
A ruined sinner and a wasted soul

[Outro]
And I want you
I wanna let you break my heart
I wanna let you break my heart
I wanna let you break my heart
And I wanna let you break me

[Intro]
Ha, it's Wizop
Burr
If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you

[Verse 1]
Re-rock a brick, put it in the press then it gettin DDT’d
When I pull with them bales my nig', you know it's COD
All these diamonds drapped all over me, your bitch can't even see
These exotic fabrics make her wanna suck me up for free
Back to all these pints stuffed in my house and I don't even drink
All these anti-depressants I sell I think that I'm a shrink
Pop me one of those whatchumacalls and fucked her on the sink
Baby lickin' the back on my balls, now I can't even think
They just tryin' to keep up with the kid and ain't been out a year
Oh, you thought you was on to somethin' man you boys ain't even real
Metro why you wanna do this tape man you know that they gon' hate
Don't compare them lil' boys to me, twenty million out the gate

[Chorus]
Coupe a half million, hurt a nigga feelings
Watch a quarter million, hurt a nigga feelings
House ten million, hurt a nigga feelings
I'm up thirty million, hurt a nigga feelings
Coupe a half million, hurt a nigga feelings
Watch a quarter million, hurt a nigga feelings
House ten million, hurt a nigga feelings
I'm up thirty million, hurt a nigga feelings

[Verse 2]
Found out my friends weren't really my friends, not there through thick and thin
Out the pen ain't been home two minutes, I jumped in the Benz
See the world through my darkly tinted vintage Gucci lens
Me and mines were like Bonnie and Clyde and we ain't try pretend
Niggas hurt 'cause they seen that 'Vert drop top, half a M
Steppin' out like a Fiji water, sparklin' with gems
These are Gucci boots they cost two stacks man, these are not no Timbs
I'm so hood, no matter how much I'm still gon' get some rims
Baby lucky if she leave with me 'cause I don't even care
Bitch, Atlantic just mailed me 10 mills and I'm not even there
If you listenin' to just what I said you might be more aware
More concerned 'bout the cash you earn and not the clothes you wear
Wop!

[Chorus]
Coupe a half million, hurt a nigga feelings
Watch a quarter million, hurt a nigga feelings
House ten million, hurt a nigga feelings
I'm up thirty million, hurt a nigga feelings
Coupe a half million, hurt a nigga feelings
Watch a quarter million, hurt a nigga feelings
House ten million, hurt a nigga feelings
I'm up thirty million, hurt a nigga feelings

[Outro]
If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you

[Intro]
Huh, huh, it's Wizzop
It's Metro, Metro, huh
It's Gucci, yeah
Southside
Huh, sizzle
Metro Boomin' want some more nigga

[Chorus]
I'm just slidin' down the 'Crest on a hot summer day
All these diamonds on, it got me feelin' some type of way
Drop the top on these haters 'cause the top in the way
And if you ain't gettin' no money then you just in the way
Took my shirt off in the 'vert cuz the shirt in the way
If these hoes ain't talkin' bout fuckin' then they just in the way
All these diamonds on my fist, I'm feelin' some type of way
If that bitch ain't gettin' no money then that bitch in the way
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare, I make 5 Million a day, (Well damn, 5 million a day?)
Gucci Mane La Flare, I make 5 Million a day (Haha, hold up, okay, Wop)

[Verse 1]
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare, I make 5 million a day
Hol' up, let me clarify, I made 5 million today
Niggas lookin' at my watch, they feelin' some type of way
But these niggas ain't get money, man they just in the way
You got a hater mentality, it's hard to relate
Hol' up, let me clarify 20 mil out the gate
$10,000,000 mansion Gucci Mane Estate
With an all-gold Rollie, match the fork and the plate
My album dropped September but I'm booked up to May
These bitches sayin' that I'm gross 'cause I skeet in they face
Why you bring your friend, babe? Man, that bitch in the way
Shit, I'm tryna fuck both of y'all, I don't like to play (Wop)

[Chorus]
I'm just slidin' down the 'Crest on a hot summer day
All these diamonds on, it got me feelin' some type of way
Drop the top on these haters 'cause the top in the way
And if you ain't gettin' no money then you just in the way
Took my shirt off in the 'vert cuz the shirt in the way
If these hoes ain't talkin' bout fuckin' then they just in the way
All these diamonds on my fist, I'm feelin' some type of way
If that bitch ain't gettin' no money then that bitch in the way
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare, I make 5 Million a day, (Well damn, 5 million a day?)
Gucci Mane La Flare, I make 5 Million a day (Haha, hold up, okay, Wop)

[Verse 2]
I'm Gucci, pretty please, take your foot off these
Niggas neck let em' breathe but I just can't be
I'm too rich to give a shit 'bout anyone but me
And who gettin' cheese with me cuz that's all I see
Metro on the beat Gucci Mane got a fleet
Orange 'vert, black rims, trick-or-treat on the streets
They sent me 5 Million dollars I hadn't been out a week
And I got 5 Million niggas playa hatin' on me
Ask all the bloggers, 'cause they love to write 'bout me
Then ask the mobsters, they never sold that white like me
Ask all the boppers, them bitches like to fight 'bout me
Then ask the robbers, nobody's jewelry bright like me
Guwop's a problem, nobody talks the talk like me
Guwop's a cook man, nobody holds a fork like me
These niggas liars, no money in the vault like me
I'm a supplier, nobody stops the drought like me

[Chorus]
I'm just slidin' down the 'Crest on a hot summer day
All these diamonds on, it got me feelin' some type of way
Drop the top on these haters 'cause the top in the way
And if you ain't gettin' no money then you just in the way
Took my shirt off in the 'vert cuz the shirt in the way
If these hoes ain't talkin' bout fuckin' then they just in the way
All these diamonds on my fist, I'm feelin' some type of way
If that bitch ain't gettin' no money then that bitch in the way
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare, I make 5 Million a day, (Well damn, 5 million a day?)
Gucci Mane La Flare, I make 5 Million a day (Haha, hold up, okay, Wop)

[Outro]
Metro Boomin' want some more nigga
This the intro, Metro, Guccio, Wop, Wop!

[Intro]
Huh
Metro, let's try something (tho)
It's Drop top
It's Gucci
Huh, yeah
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
Go

[Verse 1]
I'm a ex con, used to sell crack at the Texaco
Known for toting guns and it's what I'm on probation for
Had a murder charge, but they ain't found me guilty though
Keep my head on a swivel, 'cause I robbed a couple folks
And you can call me anything, but you can't call me broke, though
Was damn near 300 pounds, but I lost the weight, though
300 pounds of mid-grade, I took it 'cross the state, though
Got a bunch of tattoos, don't ask my why I got them, though
Got a lot of loved ones, but they ain't here today, though
Really miss my homeboy, he in a early grave, though
Gucci Mane a troublemaker, I'm trying to behave, though
Niggas keep on trying me, I think they feelin' brave, though
People say they cloned me because I changed my ways, though
I fly the dope in on a drone for the pesos
All about the bucks bro, but this ain't Tampa Bay, though
I'm a livin' legend, I do magic with the Draco
In the Peach State, but I'm sellin' Cali grapes, though
And Arizona mid-grade, I swear my life is great, bro
Gucci Mane and Metro, exclusive Jordan retro
I was sellin' half a O trappin' at the Zesto

[Skit]
Aye wassup bruh, ride with me somewhere (Yo)

[?] (Huh?)
Yeah, I told the nigga "Meet me at the Zesto" (Dope)
He want a half of one (Go)

[Verse 2]
Gucci super cutthroat, but I was born broke though
Didn't have a pot to piss, so I wanted to throw it out, so
Niggas talk sideways, I hit him in his mouth though
Who you think you talking to? I had to stomp your mouth, bro
Baby got a pretty face but I just want the mouth though
You ain't come to suck me up, then what you in the house for?
Brand new Air Max and they ain't even out though
Drippin' sauce excessively and it ain't even called for
If the jewelry ain't blindin' me, then what it even about for?
Niggas want to sign to me, but I can't even vouch for
Back to back with Ralo, and we ain't even deep though
How yo clique compare to mines and y'all ain't even street though?

[Outro]
New tape alert
New watch alert
New whip alert
Brr, brr
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
It's Wizop, drop top

[Intro]
Huh
Aye, Lil Metro on that beat
Helpless, please help me
I'm helpless
When she put that pussy on me I feel helpless
Huh, Metro, Guwop

[Chorus]
The way she put that pussy on me, I feel helpless
And I want that pussy to myself, I'm selfish (true)
Say she want a nigga like me that's wealthy
Try to stay away from her but I can't help it
I'm so helpless
(Please help me, huh, somebody please help me)
I feel helpless (please help me)

[Verse 1]
Say she got that Sunshine pussy from Harlem Nights
Make you come home, say "I ain't comin' home for life"
You're like, "Damn, you don't care if you're wrong or right?"
Goin' hard on that Patrón, girl it's on tonight
I'm addicted, somebody please help me
Is there a pussy rehab? Please tell me
A thousand dollars, for cologne, she smell me
Dick harder than a rock, she felt me
I put it on her so good, she helpless
See me with her girlfriend, she jealous
I woke up with a rich bitch, we wealthy
Talkin' good cardio, we healthy
Expensive lingerie on, she sexy
She asked me when I'm comin' home, she text me
I want head in the morning, fuck breakfast
I'm the best that ever did it, fuck Elvis (Wop)

[Chorus]
The way she put that pussy on me, I feel helpless
And I want that pussy to myself, I'm selfish (true)
Say she want a nigga like me that's wealthy
Try to stay away from her but I can't help it
I'm so helpless
(Please help me, huh, somebody please help me)
I feel helpless (please help me)

[Verse 2]
She got a church girl smile but a bedroom body
But this ain't no church girl, this a grown ass woman
Get to diggin' in her stomach, got her grown ass runnin'
Tell me "hurry up" 'cause her home girl comin'
Told me beat it up, I say "You ain't said nothin'"
If you ain't seen her naked, nigga, you ain't seen nothin'
Laughin' but that camel in her jeans mean muggin'
Actin' like we family, but bitch we ain't cousins
Knockin' out the stuffings man, I'm trampoline jumpin'
Tryna set this bed on fire like it's kerosene burning
Dressed up like a naughty nurse like Halloween comin'
I'm addicted like a fiend so I give her green money

[Chorus]
The way she put that pussy on me, I feel helpless
And I want that pussy to myself, I'm selfish (true)
Say she want a nigga like me that's wealthy
Try to stay away from her but I can't help it
I'm so helpless
(Please help me, huh, somebody please help me)
I feel helpless (please help me)

Flew in two bitches from Cali (Pew)
Big Bs on me, I'm rocking Bally (B)
They drunk and they just walkin' barely
I'm headed to Paris to pick up a bag (Go, go, go)
And they treat me like one of the Jacksons
These niggas ain't trappin', ain't makin' transactions (Nah)
A nigga rob you, he be practicing (Bow)
Four bitches all tryna swallow this
I feel like I'm fightin' an octopus (Woo)

[Intro]
Huh
Huh
It's Metro
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
I finessed
Huh, whoo
Ahh
I got extra drugs
Haha

[Chorus]
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I suggest that you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, the more heads we bust
I suggest you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, the more heads we bust
I suggest you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, the more heads we bust
I suggest you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, in Glocks we trust

[Verse 1]
A conniver, a miser, a plug despiser
A Financial advisor, I make you wiser
I do stunts like MacGyver for my survival
If you a rival, I trick you, watch your tag and title
I'm a slimer, a grimer, a real big-timer
Tellin' lies to the judge with my hand on the Bible
I'm a shyster, I'm spiteful and I love rifles
And I love white folks, I walk on a tightrope
Trick you out your cargo, I feel like Pablo
My hood is a jungle, get burnt like charcoal
Take dope from the narcos and bring it to Flat Shoals
And we take chances, 'cause life is a gamble

[Chorus]
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I suggest that you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, the more heads we bust
I suggest you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, the more heads we bust
I suggest you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, the more heads we bust
I suggest you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, in Glocks we trust

[Verse 2]
Gucci two pistols, get robbed at the Crystals
I'm a trickster, she love how I'm rockin' my crystals
I can never be a victim 'cause my bruh name Victor
Three brothers, no sister, we so rough with ya
Shy with ya last week, today I gots to get ya
Kick you dead in your ass, tell you "Take that with you"
It's a lowdown dirty game, no ref, no whistle
No harm, no foul, but the team just blitzed ya
Slap you clean 'cross your head, tell the docs to stitch ya
All that flexin' with that pack, boy, you gots potential
Gon' bust you with the Draco, now you need dentures
Shitbag no tissue, we so rough with ya

[Chorus]
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Ha
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm feelin' like I took a Perc', I'm at a loss for words
It's like I smoked a pound of herbs, so please do not disturb
Feel like I drunk a pound of syrup and snorted up half a bird
Can't even find the words, I'm so at a loss for words
I'm feelin' like I took a Perc', I'm at a loss for words
It's like I smoked a pound of herbs, so please do not disturb
Feel like I drunk a pound of syrup and snorted up half a bird
Can't even find the words, I'm so at a loss for words

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Geeked up, she can't even talk
Damn, it's all my fault
Got me nervous 'cause she took a molly
She can't even walk
High as fuck, we can't even fuck
Throwed up on my Chucks
Just my luck that I caught a slut
Can't even mother
Fell asleep and woke up
With a model when you came
And she shake like a Coke bottle
Baby, what's your name?
Reminiscent, got me thinkin'
Damn, Guwop, I'm off the chain
Fucked so many famous bitches
But I'm scared to name they names
There's so many drugs I lost my mind
But I'm not ashamed
I grew up sellin' cocaine
In love with Mary Jane
Pay attention, this non-fiction
I couldn't even make it up
Drinkin' lean like I'm Pimp
One day, I might not wake up
A description of a young black man
Trappin' with a pistol
Wanna kill just like Tony did
When Manny fucked his sister
Monkey nuts on a Glock .40
I can go gorilla
So I'll point, he said 12 comin'
I done peeped the signal

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm feelin' like I took a Perc', I'm at a loss for words
It's like I smoked a pound of herbs, so please do not disturb
Feel like I drunk a pound of syrup and snorted up half a bird
Can't even find the words, I'm so at a loss for words
I'm feelin' like I took a Perc', I'm at a loss for words
It's like I smoked a pound of herbs, so please do not disturb
Feel like I drunk a pound of syrup and snorted up half a bird
Can't even find the words, I'm so at a loss for words

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Maybach Music
My Bentley ridin' on Timbalands
Painted mine like cinnamon
Burnin' weed in the Benjamin
Really high on my adrenaline
40 points, 10 assists
Game over, hit or miss
Mary J, they reminisce
Bitch niggas been on the list
One stack and the guns clap
Run the label like I run the trap
All sauce like I'm on the Perc'
Biggest boss with the warmest verse
Ladies stunned when I'm on the scene
Biggest guns, glowin' Bs
Homies had to kill for your charm
I gave the chain back to your mom

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm feelin' like I took a Perc', I'm at a loss for words
It's like I smoked a pound of herbs, so please do not disturb
Feel like I drunk a pound of syrup and snorted up half a bird
Can't even find the words, I'm so at a loss for words
I'm feelin' like I took a Perc', I'm at a loss for words
It's like I smoked a pound of herbs, so please do not disturb
Feel like I drunk a pound of syrup and snorted up half a bird
Can't even find the words, I'm so at a loss for words

[Intro: Kodak Black]
Aye, Lil Metro on that beat

[Chorus]
A hundred grand'll make a nigga cool, wanna dance with the devil
Get the gloves and the shovel, he's tryna dance with the devil
A ghetto superstar make a bitch want to dance with the devil
When she glance at the bezel, she wanna dance with the devil
Diamonds on a nigga neck dancing, dancing
Diamonds on my wrist and fist dancing, dancing
Diamonds on my pinky ring dancing, dancing
Big booty bitch keep dancing, dancing
Real trap niggas take chances, flirting with the devil slow dancing
Real street bitches take chances, flirting with the devil romancing
Dancing

[Verse 1]
Dancing all night ten grand make you dance, dance
Hundreds in my pants turn your chick to my girlfriend
Gucci in the batter's box I just walked out the bullpen
Pitching dog food, make a junkie out your husband
Hundred stacks'll make 'em shoot you clean in your dad hat
Catch you at the trap and shoot you clean out your Hellcat
Everybody wanna be the kingpin, man
The feds snatched 'em up, now we ain't seen this man
2017, everybody get high
Taking street drugs like they ass can't die
And I ain't tryna preach 'cause I got high too
I'm an ex-drug dealer, nigga how 'bout you
I'm an ex-con, ex-hood, long with a dope bomb
Niggas don't make twenty-one where I come from (Wow)
Took a chance and fucked a hood hoe, no condom
Took a chance and put a price tag on your loved one

[Chorus]
A hundred grand'll make a nigga cool, wanna dance with the devil
Get the gloves and the shovel, he's tryna dance with the devil
A ghetto superstar make a bitch want to dance with the devil
When she glance at the bezel, she wanna dance with the devil
Diamonds on a nigga neck dancing, dancing
Diamonds on my wrist and fist dancing, dancing
Diamonds on my pinky ring dancing, dancing
Big booty bitch keep dancing, dancing
Real trap niggas take chances, flirting with the devil slow dancing
Real street bitches take chances, flirting with the devil romancing
Dancing

[Verse 2]
Tattoos all over but she bougie
Acting stiff but her booty keep choosing
In every neighborhood there's a Gucci
The neighborhood dealer with an Uzi
Baby started off right as a good girl
Now she's tryna act hard like a hood girl
Tryna catch a nigga playing for the Falcons
But steady sucking up the nigga with the dragons
Diamonds on my neck and wrist lit, it's a combo
Yellow bitch, her dark skin friend, call it gumbo
Pull up in a lot and the car cost a condo
Leave with your chick but send her back with a grand though
Yeah, yeah, it's Gucci Mane and Metro
If Metro don't trust you I'ma foot you in your asshole
Yeah, I started from the bando
I took her to the 6 but no, that's not Toronto

[Chorus]
A hundred grand'll make a nigga cool, wanna dance with the devil
Get the gloves and the shovel, he's tryna dance with the devil
A ghetto superstar make a bitch want to dance with the devil
When she glance at the bezel, she wanna dance with the devil
Diamonds on a nigga neck dancing, dancing
Diamonds on my wrist and fist dancing, dancing
Diamonds on my pinky ring dancing, dancing
Big booty bitch keep dancing, dancing
Real trap niggas take chances, flirting with the devil slow dancing
Real street bitches take chances, flirting with the devil romancing

Drop-top
Wop
(If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Cartier frames, call me four eyes
Still can cook a deuce up with both eyes closed (Skrrt)
A lot of people still got a lot of shit to say
About the clothes and the pics I post (Huh?)
But it's a beautiful day outside today (Yeah)
Don't know what car I'ma drive today
Promoter just brought me two hundred grand
And I'ma count it by hand, all hundreds, with both eyes closed

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I've got a chick so fine, make a blind man see her (Woo)
She runnin' through my mind, that's a fine idea (Yeah)
And I ain't Blake Griffin, I don't drive no Kia (Huh?)
If it ain't ten mil', I can't sign no deal (No)
I'm all about a check, fresh Nikes, let's do it (Checks)
And I spy a bitch that wanna straight get to it (I spy)
Trap tutorial, ridin' down Memorial (Yoom)
From the bando to the Waldorf Astoria (Woah)
If you don't like to see niggas shine, then close your eyes then (Huh)
We on a private island, vibin' to violins
Autobiography, Gucci Mane the author
And I'm the trap sponsor, Gucci Mane's the father (Yeah)
An eight-figure nigga just walked into Walter's (What?)
If you ain't gettin' money, then move out of Georgia (Go)
Hundred tapes and goin', go check my discography (Woah)
The freshest nigga livin', go check your photography (It's Gucci)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Cartier frames, call me four eyes
Still can cook a deuce up with both eyes closed (Skrrt)
A lot of people still got a lot of shit to say

Don't know what car I'ma drive today
Promoter just brought me two hundred grand
And I'ma count it by hand, all hundreds, with both eyes closed

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I just drove the Tesla with both eyes closed (True)
Made a hundred thousand on the one-eyed stove (That's right)
Two-tone Wraith and a two-tone PP
Walked out of Gucci with the two-tone GG (Tell 'em)
Bulletproof Rhino, coke color albino
Yeah, my sauce A1, no Fogo de Chão
Makin' money in piles, sellin' people the pyro
Click the link in the bio, I'm the illest that I know
I'm the illest to rivals, all my cars got a title
Had to rock just like Tidal, sell a preacher the Bible
I'm a hustler for real, sell a hospital vitals
Sell my cousin some Adderall 'cause he takin' his finals
Tity Boi your highness, make it through any crisis
All I do is look straight, all the bullshit behind us
Got the 'Ye on the bracelet, got the 'Ye on the frame
Got the 'Ye on the watch, wore the 'Ye to the game

[Chorus: Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz & Young Dolph]
Cartier frames, call me four eyes
Still can cook a deuce up with both eyes closed (Skrrt, wow)
A lot of people still got a lot of shit to say
About the clothes and the pics I post (Huh? True)
But it's a beautiful day outside today (Yeah)
Don't know what car I'ma drive today
Promoter just brought me two hundred grand (Hah)
And I'ma count it by hand, all hundreds, with both eyes closed (Hold up)

[Verse 3: Young Dolph]
Don't mean to brag and boast, but I be fresher than most (Ayy)
Ran through my first million playin' on the West Coast (Trap)
Keep some pretty girls 'round me everywhere that I go
We made it out the streets, pop a bottle, let's make a toast
I run circles 'round square niggas with a blindfold
She said, "Let's make love", want me to fuck with my eyes closed (What?)
But lil' mama so fine, when she took her clothes off
I went straight in it, both eyes closed
(You crazy, bruh)
Hah, wait a minute, I'm fresh as fuck, let me strike a pose (It's Dolph)
Hands down, iced up, white and rose gold (Yeah)
She walkin' 'round my penthouse in my Versace robe (Hah)
Since a juvenile, I stuck to the G code (Uh-huh)
Servin' out the kitchen, but I never touched the stove (Nah)
I told my bitch, "You mines now, you ain't gotta work"
Just keep it real and let's go spend the mils

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Cartier frames, call me four eyes
Still can cook a deuce up with both eyes closed (Skrrt)
A lot of people still got a lot of shit to say
About the clothes and the pics I post (Huh? Fuck 'em)
But it's a beautiful day outside today (Yeah)
Don't know what car I'ma drive today
Promoter just brought me two hundred grand
And I'ma count it by hand, all hundreds, with both eyes closed

[Intro]
Bucket list
Cut it up
Huh
It's Gucci
Metro Boomin want some more nigga

[Verse 1]
Fuckin' Wop on her bucket list, I flex so effortless
Fuckin' twins and they goin' in like they ain't relatives
There's a slim chance that she may get this dick, like one percent
I'm so arrogant right now, man, I don't even want the bitch
Right back, scoopin' my dog from prison on my bucket list
Know they goin' so hard in the yard if they listen to this
Goin' quadruple platinum, that's not on my bucket list
Bitch, my Rollie went quadruple platinum, you should see this shit
It's no way possible I'm falling off, that don't exist
I wasn't rappin', I'd be sellin' narcotics just to pay the rent
That new Lambo on my bucket list so I just bought that bitch
It ain't a chick I feel that I can't get, man, that's that sucker shit

[Chorus]
Bucket list, drop top 'Rari, scratch that off my bucket list
Bucket list, mega mansion scratch that off my bucket list
Bucket list, super bad bitch and she rich like Gucci rich
Bucket list, no more sellin' bricks, that's off my bucket list
Bucket list, drop top 'Rari, scratch that off my bucket list
Bucket list, mega mansion scratch that off my bucket list
Bucket list, super bad bitch and she rich like Gucci rich
Bucket list, no more waitin' to get that off my bucket list

[Verse 2]
Big boss business, quarter million on a pendant (brr)
Eight figure nigga, realest nigga in the business
Sittin' front row, freshest nigga in attendance
Gave a thousand dollars to the valet attendant
They ain't seen a player like me in a minute
Fuck your award, I don't even wanna win it
Rich hood dick, every singer wanna get it
Real authentic, everybody wanna live it
How a white man gon' criticize me 'bout reppin' these streets?
Man, fuck you critics
Change my name to "The best that did it"
Gucci turnt up, nigga just admit it
If I don't go gold I ain't fucked up 'bout it
With all this gold draped on my body (brr)
When I get married, that's a gangster wedding
Call my reception the gangster party

[Chorus]
Bucket list, drop top 'Rari, scratch that off my bucket list
Bucket list, mega mansion scratch that off my bucket list
Bucket list, super bad bitch and she rich like Gucci rich
Bucket list, no more sellin' bricks, that's off my bucket list
Bucket list, drop top 'Rari, scratch that off my bucket list
Bucket list, mega mansion scratch that off my bucket list
Bucket list, super bad bitch and she rich like Gucci rich
Bucket list, no more waitin' to get that off my bucket list

[Verse 1]
I'm young for tonight, it's all under my control
I won't hesitate, it's my turn to make that call
I just want a touch, I ain't here for love no more
Okay, yeah

[Chorus]
I won't stop, nah, no
Guess what?
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Ride a golden light
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to

[Post-Chorus]
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body

[Verse 2]
Some people do, but some, they just like to talk, okay
Some shoot the breeze, but some like to leave a mark, okay
Some need the light, and some people like the dark
Okay, yeah

[Chorus]
I won't stop, nah, no
Guess what?
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Ride a golden light
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to

[Post-Chorus]
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body

[Bridge]
Gimme release, keep the drugs
Gimme relief, keep the love
Just gimme a piece of that, one piece of that
Give it to me, don't judge
Just give it to me, no heart
No second degree tonight, run free tonight
I'll dance if I want to

[Outro]
Ah-ooh
My body, my body, my body (Eh la, eh la, it's my body)
Yeah (Eh la, eh la, it's my body)
My body, my body, my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Gonna dance if I want to, want to
Gonna dance if I want to, want to (Eh la, eh la, it's my body)

[Verse 1]
Talkin' in my sleep at night
Makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out
Hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
Oh, he makes me feel like nobody else
Nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me
So I tell myself, I tell myself

[Pre-Chorus]
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't getting over him

[Chorus]
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself

[Verse 2]
I keep pushin' forwards
But he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, nowhere to turn)
Now I'm standing back from it
I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)
But my love, he never loves me
So I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

[Pre-Chorus]
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't getting over him

[Chorus]
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself

[Bridge]
Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna' learn it by heart
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it 'cause I (I, I, I)

[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em, baby
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
(I'm tellin' 'em to myself, I'm tellin' 'em to myself)
I've got new rules, I count 'em
(I'm tellin' 'em to myself)
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself

[Verse ]
She said she ready to go to my bed
I told her all the things I wanna do to her body
Baby, let me take my time ‘cause
All I want is you, licking on your pussy, girl, I'm lovin' it
With my body on you

[Chorus]
On an empty stomach, eat it like it's dinner time, time
Eat it like it's dinner time, dinner time
Eat it like it's dinner time, dinner time
Eat it like it's dinner time, dinner time

[Lyrics from Snippet]

Oh make em yours
You could be the man if you want
Play it smart


So insecure about who you're not
I know you're different, you-
(Snippet)

[Intro: Nick Papz]
Pa-Papamitrou- BOI!

[Verse]
Niggas said they would be with me but I don't be with niggas
Diamonds shining like a swiper all my pieces hitin' lit
The niggas broke and can't be beefing with us
Put some respect up on my name, all tree them niggas
I got a fetish for fettucine and a Lamborghini
Bad bitches that never see me want to double team me
Triple double get what I want like I own a genie
Aladdin, my bitch look like Jasmine
Fuckin' with that nigga and you know he told
I'm the realest nigga on the totem pole
Chasin' down the money 'til I overload
Two bad bitches on the menu I take both of those
I don't care if they was real sisters
Niggas broke talkin' like they real niggas
Only thing that's real about 'em is that they real bitter
And real salty fuck 'em

[Verse 1]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 2]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

[Verse 3]
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 4]
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how
You were inverted
No one alerted you

[Verse 5]
I look from the wings at the play you are staging
While my guitar gently weeps
As I’m sitting here, doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Intro: T-Pain]
Woah, ah
Yeah, ah
Woah, ah
Yeah, ah

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]
Oh, I think I found the one

[Chorus: T-Pain]

She can talk the drawers off your bitch ass
And bring 'em back to me and we gon' dog-fuck your bitch fast

She make me cum quick, we fuck like three times a day
Suck me unconscious, I give her 300K
And then she move it, across the border

She on that cool shit, she know what to do
Man, you say it's fuck me, no it's motherfuck you

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]
And she make me say oh, I think I found the one

She balling with the crew
And she just like me 'cause all she wanna do

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Fuck bitches, get money

All she wanna do is fuck bitches, get money

[Verse 3: Young M.A]
See I got this lil' jawn, we ain't together but we fuck around
Told her, "Listen, shawty, you ain't messin' with no suckers now"
And she 'bout that life, she see a opp and she run it down
And I gotta make her cum every time she come around
Pour a cup of brown and we freakin', we freakin'
Hustle on the week days, freakin' on the weekends
And she get her own checks, she don't give me no stress
She ridin' like a road test and she stick with me like a drum and

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]
Oh, I think I found the one
Yeah, my baby girl gon' give me a son

She balling with the crew

[Chorus: T-Pain]

[Verse 1]
I built a wall so high, no one could reach
A life of locks, I swallowed all the keys
I was petrified, only knew how to hide
They can't hurt me if they don't know me
A full facade made a mirage outta me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Then you came and started digging for a treasure underneath
And you found a better version of me I had never seen

[Chorus]
Into me, you see
Into me, you see
You broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me, you see
Into me, you see
You got me wide open, now I'm ready
Is this intimacy?

[Verse 2]
I was a ship floating aimlessly
So camouflaged, was my own worst enemy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Then you came in like a sailor with a heart that anchored me
And every day, I wake up grateful I'm no longer lost at sea

[Chorus]
Into me, you see
Into me, you see
You broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me, you'll see
Into me, you'll see
You got me wide open, now I'm ready
Is this intimacy?

[Bridge]
Oh, 'cause no one's ever seen me like this
Seen right through the bullshit
I pray that I can keep unfolding
Pray that I can just stay open
Just stay open, just stay open, just stay open

[Chorus]
Oh, 'cause you broke me wide open, open sesame
Into me, you'll see
Into me, you'll see
You got me wide open and now I'm ready
This is intimacy
I had a dream you were in your birthday suit
You stared at me from across the room
You walked over slowly, with a look on your face
It wiped out all of my fear and my troubles away

Oh, what I would give to feel that feeling one more time
Oh, it's something I can't explain

I had a dream that you were in your birthday suit
You stared at me from across the room
You walked over slowly, with a look on your face
It wiped out all of my fear and my troubles away

Oh, what I would give to feel that feeling one more time
Oh, it's something I can't help but explain

[Verse 1]
I wanted her, she wanted me
It's all I need, at least I thought it would be
I wanted her, she wanted me
The want has my mind

[Chorus]
I want you, I want you to want me
I want you, I want you to want me

[Verse 2]
I wanted her, she wanted me
It's a mistake, at least I want it to be
I wanted her, she wanted me
The want has my mind

[Chorus]
I want you, I want you to want me
I want you, I want you to want me

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
Must've been crazy to think that you loved me
I saw all the signs but I just couldn't say nothing
I did the time across the line for you
'Cause I can't see myself with nobody else but you
Tell me what you're thinking 'cause this is what you wanted
Should've been the one to hold me when I got lonely
'Cause every time I think of the lies you told to me
Make it easy for me to leave

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me
You plus me
You plus me

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
You plus me, yeah
Swear it took a long time for you to trust me
Tried to tell me all the time how much you fought with me
Swear you showed me how to love and what it really means, what it really means
10 toes stomped down
Had to leave 'em all alone and lock my baby down
You know I keep you in designer, you my baby now
Girl, you know I been stacking dough, no more Macy's now

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Ty Dolla $ign]
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me
You plus me, babe, oh yeah, oh
You plus me, oh
You plus me

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Gotta keep on pushing and love myself through the hard times
Gotta keep my patience, still a long way to go now
There's so much to learn
When we trust the love that's deep in us
Then love will return (yes, it will)
Boy this thing was, a love lesson

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Ty Dolla $ign]
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me was a love lesson
In too deep without imperfection
Not always good, but I stayed on my feet
You had me, should've never questioned
You plus me

[Outro]
You plus me
You plus me
You plus me
You plus me
You plus me

[Chorus]
And now, breathe deep
I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
And now, breathe deep
I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between

[Verse 1]
I was walking through icy streams
That took my breath away
Moving slowly through westward water
Over glacial plains

[Pre-Chorus]
And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me, oh my, I thought it was a dream
So it seemed

[Chorus]
And now, breathe deep
I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Leave me be
I'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in between
You and I, there's air in between

[Verse 2]
Cut my hair so I could rock back and forth
Without thinking of you
Learned to talk and say
Whatever I wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
And I walked off you
And I walked off an old me
Oh me, oh my, I thought it was a dream
So it seemed

[Chorus]
And now, breathe deep
I'm inhaling
You and I, there's air in between
Leave me be
I'm exhaling
You and I, there's air in between
You and I, there's air in between
You and I, there's air in between

[Outro]
You and I, there's air in between
You and I, there's air in between
Inside this bag, So many bags
Just to try and find a place to

Inside this bag, You can get stuck
Going deeper inside (Losing your mind)
Even when when my tastes aren't me (Baby)
I'll still go to the party
Let me pick you up
That pick me up

Where it all goes down

Bag her like a brick of white, she'll be at the crib tonight

Uh, uh uh
And you can catch it like an early flight
Make an appointment, I'm your dentist for your pearly whites
You claimin' that you never do it but I'm sure you might
I get you in the mood, something that I'm sure you like, yikes
See I ain't lookin' at them other chicks
I throw you the bone you can catch it like a glover's mitt
Something like McDonald's, call me Ronald 'cause you lovin' it
And my honeys be celibate, something that you ain't fuckin' with
I'm on the road I bang, these bitches know my name
If they don't fuck me 'cause the money, it's 'cause I showed the chain
I always been a boss, I never spoke to lames
To them I'm so so deaf nigga, no Jermaine
I'm wit' a bad chick probably got your cash under
And she not Mario but she like to smash brothers
Black covers on the sheets, sittin' Latin lover
I smack the ass and pull back the rubber, I'm about to smash

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & Carlisha]
Baby be my one night I'ma put it on you

Ay, ay, ay be my one night lover
I'ma get you hotter than a one night summer

[Post-Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Ay, shawty I gotta hold down so I'm only in town for one night
So you gotta get it now so I'm hoping you're down for something nice
Say your man can't afford it but to me I blow it, it's something light
I bet tomorrow in the morning you gon' hit up my phone with something like you sayin'

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & Carlisha]
Baby be my one night I'ma put it on you

Got me twisted, I can do it for you
This time don't pity me just tell me what you saying to me
Ay, ay, ay be my one night lover

I'ma get you hotter than a one night summer

[Post-Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Ay, shawty I gotta hold down so I'm only in town for one night
So you gotta get it now so I'm hoping you're down for something nice
Say your man can't afford it but to me I blow it, it's something light
I bet tomorrow in the morning you gon' hit up my phone with something like you sayin'

[Outro]
Bad man production
I said tomorrow in the morning yeah, phone with somethin' like
Yeah, boy
Rimes what up, you know what I'm sayin'
We don't like 'em, we one night 'em you dig
Uh, uh

[Intro: Laura Olsher]
Of course you know what a fuse is. It's a long piece of cord impregnated with gun powder
When you strike a match and light it, it burns, fitfully, spiraling to it's end
At which, there is a little surprise

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
From the planet of Krypton, ensurin' super-emcees you'll be ripped on (Ripped on)
You fell off, and it's my lyric sheet you slipped on
Get gone, spit on mics made in Hong Kong
Rock on, sing songs more mightier than King Kong or Donkey Kong
You think you want me or want this?
You want some? Hold your reputation for ransom
With these here, handsomely crafted tactics
To break a snake emcee like a cheap prophylactic
Galactic, spaced-out gabbin' grabs attention
Got heads noddin' like a Pez Candy convention
Briar patch raps gash tracks in sections
Kid says this and need witness protection

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield]
Tryna say what I can't be sayin', I'll be here
Tryna say what I can't be sayin', I'll be here

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Yo, dig this, dig this
Yo, it's the junkyard, crooked letter C-I-en-tific
Duck us, the ruckus I bring stings your eardrum
Hear one line I let loose, find me fearsome
Opposin' troops on my home front shall be gone
Testin' the eight hundred-eighteenth battalion
Shall I go on? Crews run like rebels
Enola Gay rhymes kick the notch up a level in intensity
Send back attacks that you sent to me
Blow up your spot with grenades that were meant for me
Empty three verses on thirty-three emcees
Swiss cheese your gear, puttin' shrapnel in the breeze
Bleed emcees of enemy companies with my hand full of lyrics, talking ‘bout, "You want these?"
Please, don’t even speak the name of Ken on some Go Go gadget mic shit
Put it down like pens for my friends and my fam
Better Dodge, or I’ll Ram this mic shaft through the back of an emcee’s hand
With the strength of He-Man, a Cringer don’t want that
Close bodies fill fields in hand-to-hand combat
Battle cats in cypher sessions of speech
Warfare of words flashin' that cordless heat
Compete for an edge, lyrical shots get lit
Don’t question my intention when your bucket gets kicked

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield & Mike Shinoda]
Tryna say what I can't be sayin', I'll be here
(Teflon metallic, syllaballic attacks)
Tryna say what I can't be sayin', I'll be here
(Haunt emcees with these lyrical back smacks)

[Bridge: Mark Wakefield]
Should've told you so
(Why?) Why wait? I shouldn't have told you so
Why wait? I shouldn't have told you so
Why wait? I shouldn't have told you so
Why wait? I shouldn't have told you so (Try)
Why wait? I shouldn't have told you so
Why wait? I shouldn't have told you so
Why wait? I shouldn't have told you so
Why wait? I shouldn't have told you so

[Chorus: Mark Wakefield & Mike Shinoda]
Tryna say what I can't be sayin', I'll be here
(Teflon metallic, syllaballic attacks)
Tryna say what I can't be sayin', I'll be here
(Haunt emcees with these lyrical back smacks)

[Intro: Mike Shinoda, Emcee 007]
(Always prevail, the human third rail)
Yo, yo, I put Xero
(Exhale the smoke from Molotov cocktails)
Junkyard Scientific, Styles, haha
(Always prevail, the human third rail)
Yo, I thought you knew, I thought, ha, uh
(Exhale the smoke from Molotov cocktails)
I tell ya, ha, uh

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, Mark Wakefield, both]
It's like a royal flush, a rush when I bust verbally
Plus crush Earth's crust and enemy emcees to dust with one touch
Stonehenge rhyme-riddle a mystery
With Earth-rattle reckonin', rewritin' your history
With blistery flesh, meshed with a mess of a civil unrest on wax
Test pressed, scratched with finesse and next
Blessed with extraterrestrial techs
And programmed for the organs above your necks
Undressin' hip-hop, and makin' it over again
This is the end
Ill men you'll never defend
From the deep end, we watch trends, and then we see rock
And devise plans, strand them in the penalty box
To mentally stop brains of virtual train wrecks
Dissect the picture to the words turned up by the text
What's next? Heat-seeking treats meet your sect
When you spit a thousand words, and haven't painted a stroke yet

[Chorus 1: Mike Shinoda, Mark Wakefield]
Believe this, (Believe this) I'm only in it for the fiends (For the fiends)
And mean every single sentence that I scream (It's just the sound)
It's just the sound as the breakbeat kicks
That's got us all dancin' in the mist (In the mist)
Believe this, (Believe this) I'm only in it for the fiends (For the fiends)
And mean every single sentence that I scream (It's just the sound)
It's just the sound as the breakbeat kicks
That's got us all dancin' in the mist, mist

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Mark Wakefield]
With your incomphrehensible bullet-hole ventilators
Stainless steel metal, invincible, diamond, and platinum-plated
Psychologically fabricated facade
God-sent, and hellbent, are mentally not making' any sense to me
Eventually, you tempted me to put you on the choppin' block
As a sacrifice to hip-hop when I knock you off
A razor blade, (Uh) and pop, and lock the axe in
Put your head in a basket as an example for those who pass it
Medievally approaching these festivities
Jump around (Uh) frequently when you see me, like BDP on PCP
Frequently, me and Mark transform like DMC
To soundwaves of song set in every frequency

[Interlude: MIke Shinoda, Emcee 007, Mark Wakefield]
(Always prevail, the human third rail)
Endlessly worthless, cryin' out your curses
(Exhale the smoke from Molotov cocktails)
Playin' all these games, and turnin' this into a circus
(Always prevail, the human third rail)
Witless, and worthless, and cryin' out your curses
(Exhale the smoke from Molotov cocktails)
Playin' all these games…
(Yo)

[Chorus 2: Mike Shinoda, Mark Wakefield]
Believe this, (Believe this) I'm only in it for the fiends (For the fiends)
And mean every single sentence that I scream (It's just the sound)
It's just the sound as the breakbeat kicks
That's got us all dancin' in the mist (In the mist)
Believe this, (Believe this) I'm only in it for the fiends (For the fiends)
And mean every single sentence that I scream (It's just the sound)
It's just the sound as the breakbeat kicks
That's got us all dancin' in the mist

[Outro: Emcee 007]
(Always prevail, the human third rail, I exhale the smoke from Molotov cocktails)
One two, one, one, yeah, one two
(Always prevail, the human third rail, I exhale the smoke from Molotov cocktails)
Ha, ha, ha, Cash Double-Oh, Xero, 818, you know? That's how we do
(Always prevail, the human third rail, I exhale the smoke from Molotov cocktails)
Xero, 818, you know? That's how we do
(Always prevail, the human third rail, I exhale the smoke from Molotov cocktails)
Yeah, check it out, y'all, check it out, Cash Double-O
Tell your grandparents, tell your brother and sister, tell everybody, ha (

[?] yea, Artofficial)
One two, ha, ha, one two, ha, one two (Yeah, just like that, yeah, just like that, yeah, just like that)
(Yeah, just like this)
Yo, can you hear me?
Haha, it's like that
I ain't takin' it back, haha

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I will be myself
Until it's time
For me to fly

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And I will walk away
From this message on my board
I will walk away, yeah

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
You must be yourself
Until it's time
For us to fly

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And I will walk away
From this message on my board
I will walk away, yeah

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
The night in the corner at the back of the hall
Where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
The night in the corner at the back of the hall
Where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
The night in the corner at the back of the hall
Where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
The night in the corner at the back of the hall
Where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
Calling from all sides, they surround all around
You can't see a thing, but you can hear the sounds (I will walk away)
Falling from the sky, upside-down
To the beat of heart as your whole head pounds (I will walk away)
Calling from all sides, they surround all around
You can't see a thing, but you can hear the sounds (I will walk away)
Falling from the sky, upside-down
To the beat of heart as your whole head pounds

[Interlude: Chester Bennington]
I will be myself, yeah

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And I will walk away
From this message on my board
I will walk away, yeah

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
The night in the corner at the back of the hall
Where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
The night in the corner at the back of the hall
Where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
The night in the corner at the back of the hall
Where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
The night in the corner at the back of the hall
Is where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
The night in the corner at the back of the hall
Where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
The night in the corner at the back of the hall
Is where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
The night in the corner at the back of the hall
Where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall
The night in the corner at the back of the hall
Is where we sit all alone and listen to the rainfall

[Pre-Chorus]
I love it when you tell me shut up
Take it, just do it to me like that
Like how you watching me throw it right back
Feeling good off that liquor, we faded
Just let it go, let it go, tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, I can’t wait to call you daddy
Oh, daddy (Do it to you crazy)
Oh, daddy
Baby, when we do it rough
I’m screaming daddy
Daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy

[Verse 1]
My eyes sparkle ‘cause you’re mine
Guy, skip wine and dine
It's time, for you to lay back and unwind
Wind, just do it, baby

[Refrain]
Can we take it slow? But baby I don’t care
If it's dangerous, baby, you know I ain’t scared
I’ma let you pull my hair, baby, I’m ready

[Pre-Chorus]
I love it when you tell me shut up
Take it, just do it to me like that
Like how you watching me throw it right back
Feeling good off that liquor, we faded
Just let it go, let it go, tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, I can’t wait to call you daddy
Oh, daddy (Do it to you crazy)
Oh, daddy
Baby, when we do it rough
I’m screaming daddy
Daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy

[Bridge]
But it's your love that gets me high, high, high, high, high
So let's do whatever for tonight, night, night, night, night

[Verse 2]
That's my shit, I do that
I take control of it, take control of it
Baddest bitch you knew that
A little crazy and a little tipsy
I'm about to pass out
Rodeo, I’m about to go and ride it, baby
Don't wanna do the usual
Let's make love in your Mercedes
In traffic, green light, boy, just go for it
Do gymnastics, I’m nasty, just jump on it
Just jump on it, come baby, where you wanna play?

[Refrain]
Can we take it slow? But baby I don’t care
If it's dangerous, baby, you know I ain’t scared
I’ma let you pull my hair, baby, I’m ready

[Pre-Chorus]
I love it when you tell me shut up
Take it, just do it to me like that
Like how you watching me throw it right back
Feeling good off that liquor, we faded
Just let it go, let it go, tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, I can’t wait to call you daddy
Oh, daddy (Do it to you crazy)
Oh, daddy
Baby, when we do it rough
I’m screaming daddy
Daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy

[Outro]
But it's your love that gets me high, high, high, high, high
So let's do whatever for tonight, night, night, night, night

We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun
No

God bless us every one
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun
No

And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding light
(God bless us every one / we're a broken people living under loaded gun)
Oh / like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky
God save us every one
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns
For the sins of our hand
The sins of our tongue
The sins of our father
The sins of our young
No

God save us every one
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns
For the sins of our hand
The sins of our tongue
The sins of our father
The sins of our young
No

And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding light
(God save us every one / will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns)
Oh / like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky

Oh / like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky
Lift me up / Let me go
Leave it all / Down below
Lift me up / Let me go
Leave it all / Down below
Lift me up (Up) / Let me go (Go)
Leave it all (All) / Down below (Oh)
LIFT ME UP (Up) / LET ME GO (Go)

[Intro: Mary J. Blige]
It's been a long ride, but I made it here with love
I made it here with love, love
Said I've been and up and down and I've been through it all
Took a while to know my heart
Oh, yes, it has, yeah
Before a love like this, you go
Through the fire and valley lows
But if you just hold on
Please hold on 'cause love is strong, it'll save ya
Oh, please hold on, it'll save ya, save ya

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
Truth can be the sweetest pain
It can mess up everything
It's the only way you know
I'm payin' for it, I'm changin' for it
Oh, oh, and it hurts
But I'll make it work
'Cause I'm no beginner
I'm a winner, paid dues, I know my purpose

[Refrain: Mary J. Blige]
Thought they'd put my life on hold
But I knew somethin' they didn't know
I know myself too much to ever fold
Dark clouds, I'm movin' past you

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Oh, you gotta love yourself
If you really wanna be with someone else
You gotta feed yourself
Before you feed somebody else
You gotta stay open, and don't be foolish
'Cause everybody don't mean you well
You gotta love yourself
Before you love somebody else

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Murder for hire, I require finer taste
Light the stage, setting fire to the whole Empire State
Marmalade, niggas toast, andalé, I'm finna ghost
Bought a Wraith and a ghost, parked it where my mama stay
By the way, did I mention all the thots up in my mentions
Do a lot to gain attention? But I'm sure they'll find a way
Bigger business raising stakes, charging with a higher rate
Never mention competition, I just go annihilate
Roll a J, Mary Jane, actually that's Mary J
I'm fornicating with some twins like Ashley and Mary-Kate
Oh my days! Anyways, goodness sakes, her first mistake
Riding like I'm missing brakes, temporary rented plates
Just made it to my dinner date, bow your head, say your grace
Look my savior in his face
Gunning hundred miles per hour, catch you by the interstate
Told you boys it wasn't safe, give me peace, give me space
At the very least, at least just give me peace of mind to think

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Oh, you gotta love yourself, oh yeah
If you really wanna be with someone else
You gotta feed yourself
Before you feed somebody else
You gotta stay open, and don't be foolish
'Cause everybody don't mean you well
You gotta love yourself
You gotta love yourself
Before you love somebody else

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige]
I don't feel no ways tired
Can't get restless in my soul
Hold your heart, the world is cold
Keep singin', don't you stop prayin', woman
Yeah, it will come to pass
Don't worry 'bout nothin'
God knows that you're worth it
You deserve it, can't nothin' else hurt you

[Refrain: Mary J. Blige]
Thought they'd put my life on hold
But I knew somethin' they didn't know
I know myself too much to ever fold
Dark clouds are movin' past you

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Oh, you gotta love yourself, oh yeah
If you really wanna be with someone else
You gotta feed yourself
Before you feed somebody else
You gotta stay open, and don't be foolish
'Cause everybody don't mean you well
You gotta love yourself
You gotta love yourself
Before you love somebody else
Somebody else

[Chorus: CL]
I will surrender to you, babe
I will surrender to love, ayy, ayy

You the only that make me surrender, yeah
You the only that make me surrender, yeah
You the only that make me surrender, yeah
You the only that make me surrender, yeah

[Verse: Lil Yachty]
Girl, you know you really changed my life
Girl, you know you really changed my life
You're my wife
I remember those nights, we stayed up all night
Yeah, we fucked and we fight, but we know we would be alright
Oh, oh, that's why you're my type
Oh, oh, that's why you're my type
Oh, oh, oh, that's why you're my type
Oh, oh, that's why you're my type

That's why you're my type (And that's why you're my type)
That's why you're my type (And that's why you're...)

[Chorus: CL]
I will surrender to you, babe
I will surrender to love, ayy, ayy
I will surrender to you, babe
I will surrender to love, ayy
My hair blonde, your shit red like a cherry

[Intro]
It's Lil Boat
Yeah, yeah
Ayy

[Verse 1]
I've done lost respect for a lot of people (I did)
I've done lost friends I done made ends
And stuff 'bout loyalty's just a word to a lot of people (F'real)
It's not an action, these nigga's be actin'
Now I got to where I'm goin' without a lot of people (F'real)
So I hate when a nigga try to act like he made you
Nah you ain't make me, no (No)
Walk around gun 'em got a safety note (No)
Line it back in it's eight feet long (F'real)
And they hate these songs but they listen anyway (They do)
And now they think that nigga gay
'Cause they kissin' on the cover

[Chorus]
Nigga worry 'bout yo business (Business)
Nigga worry 'bout your digits
Shit used to be so easy when I rode in a Civic
Now all these people in my business
Everybody in my business, why these people in my business?
And these people in my Bentleys
And they flip just like switches
So I can't trust a soul
No I can't no, no
No I can't no, no, no (Gang)

[Verse 2]
Never will I trust no bitches (No)
Only bad things happen
Going out sad happens when you go and trust no bitches (Yeah)
Fuck that shit man I'm finna flex on 'em (Gang)
I just made a four and a fifty though (F'real)
Got a bad yellow bitch in my video (Oh)
Got her all in my hall like Arsenio (Okay)
I might be the flyest thing since this millennium (Oh)
I don't understand why the hate (No)
I think the world understand that I'm great (Yah)
Leave a Nutter Butter on that little bitch face (Ayy)
And I love when she eat it, yeah I love when she taste (Ew)
All in her face (Pew)
I'm like "hahaha", all in yo face
I'm in all of y'all face
Cause you didn't ever think but

[Chorus]
Nigga worry 'bout yo business (Business)
Nigga worry 'bout your digits
Shit used to be so easy when I rode in a Civic
Now all these people in my business
Everybody in my business, why these people in my business?
And these people in my Bentleys
And they flip just like switches
So I can't check the soul
No I can't no, no
No I can't no, no, no (Gang)

[Outro]
No I can't trust a soul
Hell nah  I can't trust a soul
All these niggas they be acting just like hoes
Always on my dick on my phone
Well you better watch who you call your bro
Well you better watch who you call your bro (Oh oh oh)
They all in my business

[Verse 1]
It's always midnight somewhere as someone contemplates her phone
And what they could possibly offer that would stop her from being alone
And if it's only coincidence that leads her to someone else
Too bad there's some things you just can't do by yourself

[Chorus]
But it's cool
I know the rules
The same ones that I learned in middle school
You keep it sweet and easy, exactly like she says
I don't know what she's crying for, she says it was only sex
Sometimes a girl forgets

[Verse 2]
It's always sad that somewhere, someone's feeling like a jerk
Just lying there in her underwear, and soon she's gonna go to work
Unless the walls collapse 'cause they were weakened by the rain
I drank my coffee slowly as she put on shoes and she walked away

[Chorus]
But it's cool
You know the rules
The same ones that you learned in middle school
You keep it sweet and easy, exactly like she says
I don't know what she's crying for, she says it was only sex
Sometimes a girl forgets

[Verse 3: Madison Acid]
Well it's 3 AM and the light was grey, the way it always is in paperbacks
I used to lay on my back and just stare at the ceiling
Trying to get a feeling that would come so easy
But love is a drug and a kiss is a hit
And I'm just standing on the corner, just wondering if
I could fall in love, well a girl could dream
Or you could die alone but... What does it all mean?

So I'll just kick these rocks and you just sing your song
And one day I'll be riding with the radio on
And I'll hear your voice but you'll be out on stage
Looking into the eyes of some girl who's name
You'll forget, but I bet she liked having you around
Just like I used to do when the rain came down
So loud, you could drown but you wouldn't get wet
I guess, some nights you just never forget

[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]
Cheddar, I can rip you to a shred of cheddar cheese
There's not a better MC than me
I'm B-Rabbit, bitch, sting like a bee, float like a butterfly
What am I? So what if I cut a guy?
Did I s-s-stutter, guy?
Leave you punch-drunk from lunch truck to Shelter
You never felt the wrath or felt the skelter, melt ya
Got the belt for the welterweight champ
You got in wit' a fake stamp
Garbage bag full of clothes, still pullin' hoes
Rip you from head to toe, from leg to bullet hole
Next gun, pull it slow
And aim at the Free World 'fore you let it go
Instead of "Oh, I just shot my dickhead"
And yes, you do got a big head
I can't call it, Cheddar, where's your wallet?
You're so drunk, you can outdrink the alcoholics
Make 'em say "Damn, Cheddar's the man
He needs a can surgically removed from his hand"

[Chorus: Mekhi Phifer (as Future) & Eminem (as B-Rabbit)]
Well, Jimmy moved in with his mother
'Cause he ain't got no place to go
And now I'm right back in the gutter
With a garbage bag that's full of clothes (Buss it, buss it, 'cause)
You live at home in a trailer
What the hell you gonna do? (Yeehaw! Haha)
'Cause I live at home in a trailer
Mom, I'm comin' home to you (Uh, break it down, uh, yee!)

[Verse: Eminem (as B-Rabbit), Mekhi Phifer (as Future), Both]
Well, my name is Jimmy, his name's Greg Buehl
Me, him and you, we went to the same school
This ain't cool, I'm in a rage
He's tappin' my mom, we're almost the same age
On the microphone, I drop bombs
Look at this car, thanks a lot, mom! (Haha)
"Here, happy birthday, Rabbit
Here's a brand new car, you can have it
A 1928 Delta"
This shit won't even get me to The Shelter
And I can't even say I'm from Motown
'Cause I'm back in the 810 now (Ahahahahahaha)

[Chorus: Eminem (as B-Rabbit), Mekhi Phifer (as Future), Both]
'Cause I live at home in a trailer (Haha, haha)
Mom, I'm comin' home to you

[Intro]
Clap
T-Town, let's go

Gave her something for the first time
Tore that ass off

Talking 'bout withdrawal?
Call my phone, I ain't call her back
Now she blowing me up
Now I can't go nowhere
Without her showing up

[Chorus: R. Kelly, Chris Brown & Tyga]
She trippin'

Ah, now you own me, now you own me
Trippin' when we all alone, trippin' when we lonely
Oh lordy, don't you start it
Why you worried? It's just me and the homies, ah!
Lot of money, arm, leg what the engine cost me
Bo-Bob Marley, reefer in the glove compartment
Lean, syrup coughin', I'm dead, nigga, coffin
This bitch crazy, no taxi, tryna charge me
Fe-Few hickeys, gotta lick it ‘fore you sticky
Fuck with me, pourin' double shots of the Henny
What's wrong with me? 5150 but she pretty
I called the shots but you fouled in this bitch

[Chorus: R. Kelly, Chris Brown & Tyga]

[Verse 3: R. Kelly &  Chris Brown]
Pimps up, hoes down
Only got one night in town
I don't catch feelings, I just break her down
Like a drive through, I'm In-N-Out
28's on my new shit, I keep it all white, that's a Kool Whip
Crib lookin' like a cruise ship
And your girl all on my cruise ship, hey
After party, my hotel
Got bitches all on my stairwell
Love a bad chick who don't kiss and tell

Yeah, she trippin'

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's over, it's over, I'm circling these vultures
Got me praying, man, this hunger, and feeling something rotten
Last time I saw you, said "What's up?" and pushed right through
Then I tried to catch you but we're always on the move
And now it's over, we're sober, symptoms of the culture
And the night ain't getting younger, last call's around the corner
Feeling kinda tempted and I'm pouring out the truth
Just fading out these talkers 'cause now all I want is you
Just sayin'

[Chorus]
Come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I'll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me, ooh-ooh-ooh
And I'll take you high
High, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Well, I ain't frontin' my intention, got your man outlined in chalk
It's a midnight intervention, got no plans to make it stop
Last time I saw you, said you wanna keep it light
But I'm here to tell you I'm not trying to change your mind
It's alright, ooh-ooh-ooh
It's alright, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Yeah, come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I'll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me, ooh-ooh-ooh
And I'll take you high
High
High
High, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
It's alright
It's alright
Yeah, it's alright
Yeah, it's alright

[Chorus]
So come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I'll part the sea, mmm
Just come over here and sit next to me, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
It's alright

If your looks could kill
They might charge you for murder for the shit you did
On this battlefield
You won't see no white flag, human love to quit

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the highs and lows, girl, I'm so into you
Heart made of glass, so I see right through you
It was all jokes until you laughed at what was true
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

When your heart turns cold
It's like sparking a cigarette
It burns slow
Now you're heartless, so
It's like taking shots to the head
It burns slow

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Feel that fire burn slow
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Oh, woah, burn slow

[Verse 2]
It ain't nothing like a pretty woman
It was, even if it wasn't
I'm seeing through the lies
Now I think I'm on to something
Nightmares playing in my head
Of you walking out on me
You created what's coming out of me

[Pre-Chorus]
Through the highs and lows, girl, I'm so into you
Heart made of glass, so I see right through you
It was all jokes until you laughed at what was true
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

When your heart turns cold
It's like sparking a cigarette
It burns slow
Now you're heartless, so
It's like taking shots to the head

Oh, woah, yeah, burn slow
Feel that fire burn slow

[Verse 3]
Play with the flame, and you
Might forget your name, and you
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
Get used to the numb, to the numb
Ain't what you want no more
I'll probably make it look too easy (Oh woah)

[Chorus]
When your heart turns cold
It's like sparking a cigarette
It burns slow
Now you're heartless, so
It's like taking shots to the head
It burns slow (Oh, woo)

To my Heartbreak Hotel
Come break my heart (yeah)
Come break my heart
Come break my heart
Come break my heart
At my Heartbreak Hotel

[Verse 2]
Don't be afraid to come closer babe
I want you to lay right next to me
I'm gonna keep the lights on
Wanna see everything
Rip my clothes off
Want you to torture me
Make yourself at home, baby this is the place
Now that we're alone, no regrets, no mistakes
The perfect sin, the perfect scandal
Just give me more than I can handle

[Hook]
You can have it, you can hold it
Take my heart, girl, and control it
Want you to break my heart
When you touch me, love the feelin'
Now my heart stops, heart stops beatin'
Want you to break my heart

[Chorus]
No, I don't mind
You're just that fine
Let's get away
To my Heartbreak Hotel
Come break my heart (yeah)
Come break my heart
Come break my heart
Come break my heart
At my Heartbreak Hotel

(Breathing) Yeah, yeah
(Breathing) Yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
It's so quiet, you can hear my heart drop
And my Heartbreak Hotel doors lock
Don't worry 'bout the time cause I threw away the clock
Cause we could which rolls, let you take control

[Chorus]
Cause I don't mind
You're just that fine
Let's get away
To my Heartbreak Hotel
Come break my heart
Come break my heart
Come break my heart
Come break my heart
Oh!
Come and break
Come and break
My heart (my heart)
Mmm...
Slow me down, down
(Breathing) Yeah, yeah
(Breathing) Yeah, yeah

[Intro]
I start to lose my senses
Yeah

[Verse 1]
When I’m wide awake
Seein' things straight
You’re a love I gotta lose
Even though you never change
You'll stay the same
I keep on wakin' up to you
And I don’t know why
Cause I know you’re gonna make me cry
And I don’t know how
But you do it to me every time

[Chorus]
I fall into your lies
I start to lose my senses
When I look in your eyes
I become defenseless
My heart you hold
And you won’t let go
It’s so paralyzing
Under your spell'
Girl you got control
You’re so hypnotizin'
You got me sleep walking
You got me sleep walking
You got me…

[Verse 2]
Odd it seems
You’re in every dream
There’s nowhere I can get away
And you stole from me, My sanity
But I never seem to make an escape
But why
When I know you’re gonna make me cry
And I don’t know how
But you do it to me every time

[Chorus]
I fall into your lies
I start to lose my senses
When I look in your eyes
I become defenseless
My heart you hold
And you won’t let go
It’s so paralyzin'
Under your spell
Girl you got control
You’re so hypnotizin'
You got me sleep walkin'
You got me sleep walkin'
You got me sleep walkin'
You got me sleep walkin'
You got me…

[Bridge]
Can’t wait for the sunrise
To wake up and open my eyes
Somebody pinch me
So I can erase the spell she has on my life
Jay snap out the sleepin'
Sip on some coffee, we’re leavin' (leavin')
But her love will always
Keep you asleep

[Chorus]
I fall into your lies
I start to lose my senses
When I look in your eyes
I become defenseless
My heart you hold
And you won’t let go
It’s so paralyzin'
Under your spell
Girl you got control
You’re so hypnotizin'
You got me sleep walkin'
You got me sleep walkin'
You got me sleep walkin'
You got me sleep walkin'
You got me…

Uh, uh, you heard me!

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I go on and on and on and
Don't take them to the crib unless they bonin' (uh)
Easy, call em on the phone and
Platinum Chanel cologne and
I stay, dressed, to impress
Spark these bitches interest
Sex is all I expect
As they watch TV in the Lex, they know
They know, quarter past 4
Left the club tipsy, say no mo'
Except how I'm gettin' home tomorrow
Cease'll drop you off when he see his P.O
Back of my mind I hope she swallow
Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry, just ate
Riffin', she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryna wait
Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, "You know what you do to me?"
She starts off, "Well I don't usually"
Then I whipped it out, rubber? no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South (oww)
Threw that back out, in the parking lot
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top
And I don't stop, until I squirt
Jeans, skirt, butt-naked, it all work

[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G., Kelly Price]
To all you bitches wanna fuck with me! (uh!)
Biggie a nasty boy!

Biggie a nasty boy!
So I stake dick how it's supposed to be (uh!)
Biggie a nasty boy!

[Verse 2]
I remember we went to Tennessee
Then we came home, mad messages was on my phone
Bitch named Simone
Screamin', she fiendin' for the semen
Me bein' the man that I am
Took it to her condo pronto
Half Indian, I called her Tonto
Roll the chron'-chron' in the dark pronto
Few puffs, eyes got low
And off to the bedroom we go (mmm)
Sex is drama, head is trauma
Ripped pajamas, I'ma stay 'til tomorrow
Satisfying all my needs twice
With whipped cream, handcuffs and ice
The bitch is nice, word is bond
Can't wait to put my niggas on, what? what?

[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G., Kelly Price]
To all you bitches wanna fuck with me! (uh!)

Let's see, the bitch I'm waitin' on
Gardeur jeans look like they painted on
Ask P., leave it up to me
Lay her on back ever so gently

Cristal till she throw up, bitch grow up
Hold up, there's DeGenero
Dripped to death, iceberg apparel
Intro goes without speaking

[Verse 1]
A big beautiful brain with a pretty face, yeah
A babydoll with a briefcase, yeah
A hot little hurricane, ha!
'Cause I'm feminine and soft, but I'm still a boss, yeah
Red lipstick, but still so raw, yeah
Marilyn Monroe in a monster truck

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can be zen and I can be the storm, yeah
Smell like a rose and I pierce like a thorn, yeah
Karate chopping the clichés and norms all in a dress

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
You think that I'm a little baby
You think that I am fragile like a Fabergé
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
(Br-br-break me)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I bounce back like a pro 'cause I'm so resilient
LOL at all your limits
Keep your penny thoughts, I'm making a mint

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can be zen and I can be the storm, yeah
Smell like a rose and I pierce like a thorn, yeah
Karate chopping the clichés and norms all in a dress

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
You think that I'm a little baby
You think that I am fragile like a Fabergé
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me (uh-uh)
(Br-br-break me)

[Bridge]
I ain't got no strings (No strings, no strings, no strings)
I'm no one's little puppet
Got my own cha-ching, in my chubby little wallet
And secretly you love it
(You fucking love it)
And secretly you love it

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey (Hey)
You think that I'm a little baby
You think that I am fragile like a Fabergé
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
No-o-o-o-oh
Hey, hey, hey
You think that I'm a little baby
You think that I am fragile like a Fabergé
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
No-o-o-o-oh, no way (No)
No-o-o-o-oh, no way (No way)
No-o-o-o-oh, no way (Uh-uh)
Oh, you think that I am cracking, but you can't break me (Uh-uh)
(Br-br-break me)

[Verse 1]
I remember when you used to be my every other thought
But now my calendar's so full, it's easier to move on
Sometimes I swear I pass your SUV on Sunset Boulevard
I don't fuck with change, but lately, I've been flipping coins a lot

[Chorus]
I struggle
I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie
'Cause I know better, baby
I write it
Erase it
Repeat it
But what good will it do to reopen the wound?
So I take a deep breath and I save as draft

[Verse 2]
You don't have to subtweet me
My number's always been the same
But all's been said and done
Will we ever really close this case?
Yeah, I will always be here for you, but I could no longer stay
Still my body goes in shock every time I hear your name

[Chorus]
I struggle
I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie
'Cause I know better, baby
I write it
Erase it
Repeat it
But what good will it do to reopen the wound?
So I take a deep breath and I save as draft

[Bridge]
I've heard you've done some changing
I've been rearranging
Wish that I could know, but I just don't know
Never get that time back
Fear we'd fall in old traps
Why can't we just let go?
Staring at a fork in the fucking road

[Chorus]
I struggle
I juggle
I could just throw a line to you
But I should let sleeping dogs lie (Dogs lie)
'Cause I know better, baby
I write it
Erase it
Repeat it
But what good will it do to reopen the wound?
So I take a deep breath and I save as draft

[Verse 1]
I'm losing all direction
Slipping into quicksand
I've shattered the illusion
Seen behind the curtain
I'm disenchanted
Dancing on a wire
Juggling desire
Every hit gets harder
When you're fighting without armor
I'm disheartened

[Pre-Chorus]
Do I start over, rediscover?
Submit to the sweet surrender

[Chorus]
It's a mind maze, all these head games
Caught in a cage (Caught in a cage), a complex cage
Am I a car on fire?
Will I be devoured?
I gotta free myself and get out of my own way

[Verse 2]
I used to be so sparkling
But now it's not so charming
What used to stimulate me
Now can barely wake me
I'm unresponsive
Will I find salvation?
Some kind of moderation?
Spinning all these plates is
Gonna be a challenge
A delicate balance

[Pre-Chorus]
So do I start over, rediscover?
Submit to the sweet surrender

[Chorus]
It's a mind maze, all these head games
Caught in a cage (Caught in a cage), a complex cage
Am I a car on fire?
Will I be devoured?
I gotta free myself and get out of my own way

[Refrain]
Get out of my own way
Get out of my own way
Get out of my own way

[Outro]
So do I start over, re-rediscover?
I submit to your, your sweet surrender
Your sweet surrender
Your sweet surrender
No

[Verse 1]
Saw your picture on accident
Your face has changed
The lines are sinking in
I pressed play, I should haven't
Congratulations
But do you ever wonder what we could have been?
(I wonder what we could have been)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But your mind plays tricks with distance
Always makes things feel so unfinished

[Chorus]
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)

[Verse 2]
I saw a balloon floating away
I thought, "Did someone let go, or did they lose it?"
So strange, you know all my secrets
Please keep them safe
And darling, you know that I'll do the same
(You know that I'll do the same)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Though we're no longer in existence
Baby, you'll always be in my orbit

[Chorus]
I miss you more than I loved you
I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)
I miss you more than I loved you
Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you

[Bridge]
We were a match, but not a fit
We were a dream, unrealistic
We didn't lose, we didn't win
(Sometimes I wonder what we could have been)
Oh

[Chorus]
I miss you more than I loved you
Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(I wonder what we could have been)
I miss you more than I loved you
(Though we're no longer in existence)
Oh, I do
I miss you more than I loved you
(You'll always be in my orbit)

[Outro]
Ohh-oh-oh-oh (You'll always be in my orbit)
No-oh-oh-oh-oh (You'll always be in my orbit)

[Intro: Pitbull]
Let's, Mr. Worldwide (worldwide)
Take over (take over)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Yeah, how you gon' tell me the sky's the limit, ha
When there's footprints on the moon?
I don't need a TV show to dance with the stars
Not me, I'm good
Half of the world don't like me
Half of the world wanna be me
But people deny
That pretty little thing they call Earth needs me (woo!)
I'm here to show the world what it is
To make something from nothing, yeah, for sure
I'm here to show the world what it is
To do good business, have glue without flow (hahaha)
I'm here to show the world
That money don't buy happiness, believe me, I know
But just one thing
Once I show the world, I just wanna know

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Where do we go from here?
Where, tell me please?
Where do we go from here?
I want to where to tell me please?
Where do we go from here?
Somebody, please let me know

I want the whole world to show
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
And I don't wanna do it alone
I want the world to dance

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
As the sun both fades and it gets bigger (yeah)
And the more countries in the world I hit up (hahaha)
I'm the bomb, double 0, 305
AKA, Mr. Worldwide (hahaha)
Don't be silly
I've had it on lock and that's for sure
And I've already changed my city
Now I'm on my way to change the globe
I'm tryna inspire the world and show 'em what it is
When you hustle and you work hard (yeah, yeah)
Show 'em what it is
To put your life on the line for the love of grind
Life is a rhyme with no reason
And that's the reason I rhymes (yeah)
But once I show the globe, haha, I just wanna know (woo!)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Where do we go from here?
Where, tell me please?
Where do we go from here?
I want to where to tell me please?
Where do we go from here?
Somebody, please let me know
Where do we go from here?
I want the whole world to show
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
And I don't wanna do it alone
I want the world to dance

Because I'm the man who can put you in the musical brackets

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Uh, party like it's 1980
Where the afro shiny and the girls all purty

And a dark-skinned Kylie, can I rock both bodies? Ayy

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Yo, uh, we gon' party like it's 1980
In a buggy-eyed 'Cedes or a dopeboy Caddy
With a nickel bag baggie, gold Rolex
Timin' for your climax climbin', got the bedsheets jumpin'
With your heartbeat pumpin' and your love keep comin'
Shake somethin', break somethin', shit, I'm tryna work somethin'
Sho' you right, motorbike, you could ride me overnight, uh
Never been one to judge, we rushin' back to the club
Put it down from above, your body my only drug
We do it like Vegas, rich and famous
We doin' it major, we wakin' the neighbors

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Candice Pillay]
Passin' all them neighbors, cash out (Cash out)
Smashin' all them 'Raris, dash out (Dash out)

[Outro: Shelley FKA DRAM]
'70s
Hella tree
Collard greens, to me
We play, babe

[Verse 1: Elton John]
How have I come to this?
How did I slip and fall?
How did I throw half a lifetime away
Without any thought at all?

This should have been my time
It's over, it never began
Facing a world, for once not on my side
I simply turned and ran

I try to blame it on fortune
Some kind of shift in the stars
But I know the truth and it haunts me
It's flown just a little too far

I know the truth and it mocks me
I know the truth and it shocks me
Oh, it's flown just a little too far, yes

[Verse 2: Janet Jackson]
People have faith in me
I think I once did too
I promise whoever has a hold on our lives
I’ll see the bad times through
This should have been my time
It’s over, it never began
Facing a world, for once not on my side
I simply turn and ran

I try to blame it on fortune
Some kind of twist in my fate
I know the truth and it haunts me
I learned it a little too late

I know the truth and it mocks me
I know the truth and it shocks me
I learned it a little too late

[Elton John & Janet Jackson]
I try to blame it on fortune
Some kind of twist in my fate
But I know the truth and it haunts me
I learned it a little too late

I know the truth and it mocks me
I know the truth and it shocks me
Oh, ho, yet, I learned it a little too late

[Verse 1]
It's been a long year
As far as I can see
I could use a vacation
But I gotta take care of my family

Wrapping up another hard work day
I've gotta get back home
So I shift into third gear and I cruise out
To my favorite song

[Pre-Chorus]
And still I don't know why
I'm always putting up a fight
When I'm so damn tired
From working overtime

[Chorus]
If I can't get it into heaven
I best be revvin' my CJ7
Now ain't that the life
Ain't that the life (Ain't that the life)
Ain't that the life

[Verse 2]
Stepping into the morning
Sunglasses on
Head's a little weak from drinking all of these nights alone
If I can stay out of trouble
May be the death of me
But I was branded as a harmony rebel
With a tattoo at fifteen

[Pre-Chorus]
And still I don't know why
I'm always putting up a fight
When I'm so damn tired
From working overtime

[Chorus]
If I can't get it into heaven
I best be revvin' my CJ7
Now ain't that the life
That keeps rolling me by
Two kids and a wife
My Ms. American pie

If I can't get it into heaven
I best be revvin' my CJ7
Now ain't that the life
Ain't that the life (Ain't that the life)
Ain't that the life
I don't know if I'm able to be on my own
Not for long
"Work hard" my father says
Believe me I should know
You have to fall

Along the sun that keeps you warm
Oh don't you see, well that's my home
Don't try to keep me from  my daily bread songs
Kingdom come
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

You know I worked all day
My heart is bound to say
Well I've got my play in making summer salt
Been aching for a holiday
Woah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Worn in so bright you see
You wake me from my dreams
My broken seams
But I'm apart of this

[?] I mopped my floor
Mowed my yard
Around what I would do without
These wasted days
Believe me this one's mine
So long I'm gonna find the world
That leads me far beyond
This hole I found

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

You know worked all day
My heart is bound to say
Well I've got my play in making summer salt
Been aching for a holiday
Wooooo

[Faia Younan]
The heart is in agony
So we stay with the melody
Until our exodus is no more and the pain disappears
We fight
We fight against the war
Greet love with a handshake and the dreams remain
And we remain in our place where we believe in peace
We stay where we stay with the melody
We stay and we stay with the melody
Hi
Hi
Welcome
Who's this?
Jonny
Oh, okay, just checking

Shrink-wrapped magazines in a paper bag
He hugged me when I came home
Only boy in a ballet class
He hugged me when I came home
Dad's on the pulpit talking about love
Mum's in the nursery cussing me out
He hugged me when I came home
Jean was crazy but she loved me
When she died I slept in her car
He hugged me when I came home

Here, here I go again
All these memories
Coming back at me
Here, here I go again
All these memories
Get the best of me
Get the best of me
Have a headache?
We'll grab the oil
If you complain
Well, thats the devil talking
He hugs me when I come home
Your sister got married fourteen times
But if you fall in love, son, that's a crime
He hugs me when I come home
Well I fell in love and told them I was happy
My dad hugged me and said this would be the last hug
This would be the last hug
This would be the last hug

Here, here I go again
All these memories
Coming back at me
Here, here I go again
All these memories
Get the best of me
Get the best of me

Philip took me out for pizza in London
He said they were his friends and they weren't mine
Philip took me for a walk in New York City
Please hug me when I come home
He told me my story was boring
He told me my story was boring
Here, here I go again
All these memories
Coming back at me
Here, here I go again
All these memories
Get the best of me
Get the best of me

Here I go
Here I go again
Here I go
Here I go again
Here I go
Here I go again
Here I go

[Music Video Intro]
Me llamo Roberto
Y yo quiero ser famoso

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
I might go Interstellar
I feel like Matthew McConaughey
I don't care for what they gotta say
Tony Perkis how I drop the weight
Jason Bourne with the headshot
Jason Statham with the whip game
Liam Neeson with the rescue
I go Gunnar with the leather face
Bruce Campbell with the chains
Tobin Bell with the saw
Anthony Hopkins, I'm eatin' 'em raw
They don't know who we are
Molly Shannon, I'm a superstar
Ride or die like it's Seabiscuit
Tryna stack like Tobey
John Wick, I don't leave a witness
Chris Paul, I'm assistin'
Ameer go Blake Griffin
Give me forty-eight minutes
We go '04 Pistons
Catch a fade like Robert Horry
Only time to get the spotlight
Deray, how I'm top flight
Go Obama when I drop mics

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I'm the Black Tom Hanks
You can call me Nigga Banks
Secret Agent Cody Banks
Quarter pound of the dank
On the scale and it stank
Put my mama in a Range
I just bought a new Wraith
Nic Cage with the face-off
John Travolta when I take off
Brad Pitt, start a fight club
Turn the trap into the nightclub
I'm like Prince with the white doves
Paint a picture with the white dust
Lionel Richie with the white bitch
Try to tell it to her nicely
But she never wanna listen
Beat the pussy to submission
Tom Cruise on a mission
Pull a R&B singer
Bring her back to South Central
I shine just like a popstar
M.J. my initial
Kobe Bryant with the spin moves
If these niggas got issues
H-Town with Beyoncé
Turn her to my prom date
Kingpin like JAY-Z
Dance moves like JT

[Verse 3: Kevin Abstract]
Heath Ledger with some dreads
I just gave my nigga head
Standing on my two legs
Fuck what that nigga done said
Bruh, I don't fuck with no white boys
'Less a nigga Shawn Mendes
I been off and I been dead
Bad as hell, I don't bench-press
High school, they ain't fuck with me
Now, the critics don't fuck with me
My own fam ain't fuck with me
But Viceland did fuck with me
I'm the only popstar with no money
Can't drive, so I'm still running
Uber taking all my show money
But that's okay, I got more money
Not enough to get my teeth fixed
So my boyfriend in the street, bitch
In the moonlight, I get seasick
Did you see all the art that we did?
Did all that shit in a weekend
We was up all late tweakin', yeah
Ice Cube on a Friday, Chris Tucker on a Friday
Michael Cera on a Friday, Jonah Hill on a Friday
Rockin' Leo's blood diamonds
Sucked off on the highway
Police right behind me like a nigga stole his OJ
Okay, I don't play, got the same last name as O.J.

[Verse 1]
Did something change? I don’t really care anyway
You can go write something about it, and I’m
Sure I’ll like it, I like what you write about me
I’m insane, you said I don’t feel the same when you’re gone
Oh, try being here when your head's so numb
I have nothing to say about anyone

[Pre-Chorus]
My mistake, I made this about me
And I wrapped you around me like a blanket
I hate it, I hate myself

[Chorus]
Yes I was wrong, I was mean
I created such a scene
And my demons within
But I’m changing

[Verse 2]
Did something change? I don’t really care anyway
You can go write something about it, and I’m
Sure I’ll like it, I like what you write about me
Either way, I’m just another stone in the ground
I’m not someone that you'd come looking for
I’m just somebody you found

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I think I need my family ‘round
I’m standing on my head and the world is upside down
I guess it’s still turning

[Chorus]
Yes I was wrong, I was mean
I created such a scene
And my demons within
But I’m changing

[Verse 1]
What are we waiting for?
Are you in or out?
Finally, I can see what my heart needs now
I believe you and me
We can work somehow
Eh-eh-eh-eh
Hold my hand
Take a risk 'til it all falls down
Is it a sin to commit?
If so, help me now
What's a day without a kiss?
Can we live out loud?

[Pre-Chorus]
All we ever do is night time lately
I've been waiting for a lifetime for too long
I've been waiting for the right time, baby

[Chorus]
I wanna be yours (Hey)
I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours (Ooh-hoo)
Are you lookin' at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours
(I wanna be) yours
(I wanna, wanna be) yours
I wanna be yours
Hoo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Feel the rush when we touch
Electricity
Feel the heat, light me up
One hundred degrees
This is more than the crush
It was meant to be
(Eh-eh-ah-eh)

[Pre-Chorus]
All we ever do is night time lately
I've been waiting for a lifetime for too long
I've been waiting for the right time, baby

[Chorus]
I wanna be yours (Hey)
I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours (Ooh-hoo)
Are you lookin' at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours

I wanna be yours
Hoo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
I don't wanna be that, I don't wanna be that
Favorite drunken call
Oh, say you will be mine
Say you will be mine

[Chorus]
I wanna be yours (Hey)
I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours (Ooh-hoo)
Are you lookin' at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours

I wanna be yours
Hoo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse]
I’ve been waiting for so long
Waiting for you
Maybe you’ll give up and come home
I just want you

[Verse]
All these letters that you wrote
They remind me
You’re not far when you leave home
That’s the best part

[Chorus]
Is it too much to ask you to never let me go?
Is it too much to ask you to hold me even close?
Is it too much to ask you to never let me go?
Is it too much to ask?

[Verse]
It’s the road that takes you away
That’s the worst part
'Cause once it takes you, makes you stay
There’s no way out

[Chorus]
Is it too much to ask you to never let me go?
Is it too much to ask you to hold me even close?
Is it too much to ask you?

Is it too much to ask you to never let me go?
Is it too much to ask?

[Chorus]
Shawty wanna leave with a nigga, I bet

Don't be mad at me
I pull that chopper out and squeeze on you niggas
No sympathy for you niggas

[Verse 1]
Ho, shut the fuck up, miss me with the bullshit
Balling like a bitch, all my niggas hood rich
Bring some bitches to the crib, show 'em what the wood is
Your bitch look like Sheneneh, nah-uh, oh my goodness
It's 500, that be the block
Then you see that ghetto bird when you hear the shots
Where the plug at? Tell him meet me at the docks
Sent the little homie through, it might be the cops
Hold up, I'm getting money, boy
Your girl want me 'cause I got them toys
'Rari's and the Bentleys and Aventadors
Double-decker buses and them private jets, I spend it on
Painted on the Maserati, look like it been shitted on
Make her lift her skirt up, if she nervous, I'm a pervert
I be in that pussy deep, a nigga fuckin' up her cervix
Leave the condoms on the bed, man, I do that shit on purpose
'Cause I hope a nigga see it when he comin' home from work

[Chorus]
Shawty wanna leave with a nigga, I bet
'Cause she wanna be on TV with a nigga, I bet

If them niggas acting stupid, my niggas gon’ go retarded
Bet I finish it, even if you niggas start it

Well, now she up in my crib, licking my balls with her face on my dick
Know you hot, but you ain't gon’ do shit, nigga, no you not

[Verse]
Is she the same pretty girl that I met in the bar? (Oh, oh-oh-woah)
She took the stage, it was her and her acoustic guitar (Oh, oh-oh-woah)
She like the fast life, bad boys and fancy cars
Oh man, this girl got me open, I can’t find where to start
So baby, let me take your hand, then smile
I wish I could say more but this will have to do for now, oh baby

[Chorus]
I gave you just a little bit to make you want more
If you didn’t come to love me, girl, then what you come for? (Oh)

Scream my name, scream my name for me?
Can you scream my name? Oh, woah, oh

I call your line and hope you pick up for me
Tell me that you with it, with it, with it
Girl, is you really with it, with it, with it
I hope you with it (I hope you with it)
But lately, every woman giving up on me
So I hit your line up, I hope your heart is open up for me
Tell me you get it, tell me that you get it
Im hoping that you get it
So, I’m speeding so you never see my brake lights
I’ve been fiening, going crazy ‘bout you, on my late nights
I need to know

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
On my darkest days
Girl, and I can't seem to find no little peace of mind
Baby, can you scream my name?
Please girl, can you scream my name, scream my name for me?
Scream my name, scream my name for me?
Can you scream my name? Oh, woah, oh

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Thinking you get everything you want
This a relationship, a scholarship, a free ride
Say that you do everything you don't
Remember all the late nights when I cried?
Hate that I’m now *67 on your phone
Calling blocked, I’m all alone
And you know that I can't sleep, baby
Lord knows I've tried
But I hate when you're away from me, baby
Only 'posed to be mine
All mine, on my darkest days

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
On my darkest days
Girl, and I can't seem to find no little peace of mind
Baby, can you scream my name?
Please girl, can you scream my name, scream my name for me?
Scream my name, scream my name for me?
Can you scream my name? Oh, woah, oh
On my darkest days
Girl, and I can't seem to find no little peace of mind
Baby, can you scream my name?
Please girl, can you scream my name, scream my name for me?
Scream my name, scream my name for me?
Can you scream my name? Oh, woah, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain’t no other feeling better than you here, girl (aw yeah)

Wanna know, wanna know if I’m still on your mind (baby, do I cross your mind?)
Going to your favorite places hoping I'd run into you, I can’t lie

But ain't nothing like you, oh (oh, woo)

[Verse 1]
Who he with? Is it her? Is it her?
Gon' go ahead and talk about it
Where's he been? What's he on?
Everybody got opinions but I won't allow it

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I'm so alone, I swear
That there's a couple things that I would erase
I can't even go nowhere
Without being reminded of my mistakes

[Chorus]
See I've been going way out of my way
I ain't doing it no more, oh
Pay too much attention to what you say
I ain't doing it no more, oh
'Cause when they talking, they be talking
'Bout that shit that they don't know about
Yeah, I hear 'em but them words go in and out
'Cause I've been going way out of my way
I ain't doing it no more, oh

[Verse 2]
Now is he right? Is he wrong?
Get of mind of your own instead of jocking my shit
'Cause either way I'ma win
I can do it all again, I ain't never gon' quit

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I'm so alone, I swear
That there's a couple things that I would erase
And I can't even go nowhere
Without being reminded of my mistakes

[Chorus]
See I've been going way out of my way (Yeah)
I ain't doing it no more, oh
Pay too much attention to what you say
I ain't doing it no more, oh (Yeah)
'Cause when they talking, they be talking
'Bout that shit that they don't know about (Yeah)
Yeah, I hear 'em but them words go in and out
'Cause I've been going way out of my way
I ain't doing it no more, oh

[Bridge]
Can't tell me nothing, best you stay out my way
Been here for years and I'm still doing okay
So when you see me front page, headlines, all up in the news
Don't you worry 'bout me 'cause I don't give a fuck about you (Oh, woah)

[Chorus]
See I've been going way out of my way
I ain't doing it no more, oh
Pay too much attention to what you say (Yeah)
I ain't doing it no more, oh (No more, girl)
'Cause when they talking, they be talking
'Bout that shit that they don't know about
Yeah, I hear 'em but them words go in and out (Yeah)
'Cause I've been going way out of my way
I ain't doing it no more, oh
I ain't doing it no more, oh (No)
It don't matter 'cause

It don't matter 'cause
I ain't doing it no more, oh (Ayy, no)
It don't matter 'cause
I ain't doing it no more, oh (Yeah, no)

[Verse 1]
You wanna see love, it's invisible like the air
You still feel it and you can tell that it's there
So here's your chance to feel more than alive
We are not coming down, let's be one with the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
Raging waters and abandoned fields
We fly high like a rocket ship
All the raining makes you cry

[Chorus]
But I know that there is no more for me
Spread your wings and hold on to me
Won't come down, we shooting through the stars
Just like shooting stars

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Faster than the speed of sound
How we love one another
I'm starting to figure out
That we can stand any weather

[Pre-Chorus]
Raging waters and abandoned fields
We fly high like a rocket ship
All the raining makes you cry

[Chorus]
But I know that there is no more for me
Spread your wings and hold on to me
Won't come down, we shooting through the stars
But I know that there is no more for me
Spread your wings and hold on to me
Won't come down, we shooting through the stars
Just like shooting stars

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I wonder why it's always friction
Always tension, to get my attention
And I've waited, been so patient
So sick and tired of your lying, I can't take it
I'm flipping this tarot card
This is life, we can't change it
We're like the pyramids aligned with Orion

[Pre-Chorus]
How could a love that's so new feel so ancient?
I guess that love runs out of love eventually
I can't change what's meant to be

[Chorus]
Looks like this our final destination
All this love we made
We gon' let it fade away
It's time (Yeah), to let it die now
Before I let you kill me
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
I'll let our love rest in peace
Love rest in peace
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

[Verse 2]
This love is a battlefield, I'm just a soldier
I need to call the cavalry
'Cause you're taking over
Without all these different emotions
And all your ulterior motives
Girl, I don't care the fight with you
You can't have that, I just want it all back
'Cause I planned to spend my life with you
And now it's rainy days and dark clouds
Tears feel like rain on my window
Baby, can you tell me...

[Pre-Chorus]
How could a love that's so new feel so ancient?
I guess that love runs out of love eventually
I can't change what's meant to be

[Chorus]
Looks like this our final destination (Oh-oh)
All this love we made
We gon' let it fade away (Ooh)
It's time (Yeah), to let it die now
Before I let you kill me ('Fore you kill me)
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Girl, I'll let our love rest in peace
Baby, 'cause all our love right now is resting in peace
Baby, I can't take this love, you know that you're killing me, babe
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Girl, you're killing me, baby
You're trouble, babe
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, oh, oh

[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Baby, what's your name?
'Cause I gotta be honest
I ain't never seen no ass like that before
Guess you got it from your mama
Girl, you're a real baddy
Got your own money, nothin' from a nigga, you don't need none
You smoke weed, baby, I like it
But you ain't never fucked with a nigga like this

[Pre-Chorus]
So give me a chance just to try it
Girl, you let me know if you like it or not
'Cause I don't give a damn if your girls gon' hate
Looking at me funny, get the fuck out my face
'Cause all they do is talk shit, see me when they walk in
And they can see that you was coming my way

[Chorus]
No thots, only them bad bitches
No thots, you don't no man, don't need no man
No thots ‘cause only them bad ones standing here
Don't act like you don't want it
In the morning, going out with me
No thots, only them bad bitches
No thots, you don't no man, don't need no man
No thots, ‘cause only them bad ones standing here
Don't act like you don't want it
In the morning, going out with me

[Outro]
No thots, it's only them bad bitches
No thots, only them bad bitches (Ha!)

[Intro: Chris Brown]
This the type of shit I deal with all the time, huh
I just stay lowkey fine
Usually I don't miss

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Got this flight to London, I ain't pop no Xans for it
In case you was wondering, I ain't even plan for it
I just left L.A., barely caught the plane (L.A., yeah, yeah)
Don't fuck with TSA, private jets don't need no escort (oh)
Get used to this fame shit (yeah)
This you-know-all-my-name-shit (yeah)
Yeah, I'm still the same kid
That fucked around and made it (yeah)
Fucked over my main chick
The second one did the same shit
Fucked up, had a baby on her, God told me stop playing
I was in L.A., you was in MIA (L.A., you gone)
I was tryna stay but you ain't tryna wait, no
Now I'm out the way, million miles away (woah)
Thinkin' 'bout the games
I shouldn't have played, but I played it

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And now I'm missing your love, I'ma roll up
I'm faded once again, I don’t know where I am
But I just know I'm drifting far from you
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
(Now, I mean, yeah)
Uh, I blame it on the distance
That's why I'm fuckin' with these bitches
These numbers in my phone
A text pops up, she's like, "Who is this?"
You probably got a mistress
Probably every week it switches
Now is this cause for concern?
And should I be suspicious?
I'm overseas trippin', a million miles away
And she's still in L.A., my mom's out in the Bay
And these overseas minutes add up, that's a lot to pay
I can pay it, yeah I know, but it's the excuse I say
She's been tryna track me down
I feel like I'm cattin' now
Dodgin' her when she's the one
I'm out here trippin', actin' wild
Start to wonder if I've changed
I'm like how could that be now?
Would these bitches be here really
If I wasn't rappin' now?
Now tell me now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm faded once again, yeah, I don’t know where I am
But I just know I'm drifting far from you, ooh
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think, think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off, yeah
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
(You tell me, uh, yeah)
Uh, I'm just so conflicted
It's been so long since we've kicked it
And I can't lie, I've missed it
But somewhere the current shifted
And now I'm somewhere else
Far away, feel like we drifted
Hard to face the facts
I'm drinkin' to escape 'em, then get lifted
Get swept under a rug, 'til I'm trippin' on a pile
Get a change, somethin' different for a while
Yeah, we grew apart with time
We ain't kicked it in a while
But I still think about you now
Without you, see there's differences now
But shit happens, how could we have known?
Nothin' can prepare us
From sleepin' at your parents, now to sold-out shows in Paris
To parties at my hotel, ashin' blunts up off my terrace
Tell me, how'd we ever come to live this careless?
Tell me now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm faded once again, I don’t know where I am
But I just know I'm drifting far from you, ooh, yeah
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you, ha (ooh)
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love
And now I'm missing your love, ooh

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Tyga & Both]
Girl, you know we got the time
Got that pussy on my mind, later on, what are we doing?
I know you're ready, show that ass
Girl, you looking so bad, getting horny watching you do it
Girl, I wanna kiss it
While you kissing your girlfriends
I wanna see a whole lot of licking, that's a memory
Yeah, bet I make that pussy remember me
Ha, look

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I be bangin' all on that beat
808, she got the bass when her booty shake
She got her friends with her and they a sight to see
All that ass, don't let it go to waste
All this Hennessy, this liquor, 'bout to penetrate
While I'm pushin' Lamborghini's on the interstate
I long-dick her, I'ma go for hours
You minute-made like lemonade
I'm fresh as fuck in these Margielas
I skate past, a nigga better than veterans
Bipolar cold, give me the medicine
My chain too bright, no Thomas Edison
When I pull it out, bitch nervous
Better ride this wave, bitch, surf it
Girl, you better keep them legs open
Only thing you close is these curtains
And she only got time for a nigga, if I take her out to eat
A nigga really gotta motivate
Man, that's too much work for the pussy
I don't work for the pussy, nigga really don't communicate
Ha, I'd rather lick it like a dinner plate
I'd rather keep my money in a safe
Ha, bitch, I ain't got time to play
I need it now, not a minute late, ha

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Tyga & Both]
Girl, you know we got the time
Got that pussy on my mind, later on, what are we doing?
I know you're ready, show that ass
Girl, you looking so bad, getting horny watching you do it
Girl, I wanna kiss it
While you kissing your girlfriends
I wanna see a whole lot of licking, that's a memory
Yeah, bet I make that pussy remember me

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I got cash out, and that ass out
Hit it once, then I pass out
Diamonds all in my chain
Her dress see-through in my glass house
I lick the pussy, goin' through the motions
I scuba dive her,  when I'm in that ocean
I lick her down, I'ma dick her down
She gon' beg a nigga just to bend her over
In the backseats, she gettin' backshots
Doggy style, I'ma dog her out
She gon' throw that back, I'ma smack that shit
That's what the fuck I'm talkin' ‘bout
And she only want a nigga like me though
No gag reflex when she deepthroat
And she only fucks with them light skin niggas
Like El Debarge and I'm Chico, ha
What you want, babe?
Tell me if you need that shit
All on the media, take out the front page
Don't believe that shit
I done made so much money, this new shit is gettin' old to me
Nigga, check the resume and I got all the girls singing like Jodeci
That's why

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Tyga & Both]
Girl, you know we got the time
Got that pussy on my mind, later on, what are we doing?
I know you're ready, show that ass
Girl, you looking so bad, getting horny watching you do it
Girl, I wanna kiss it
While you kissing your girlfriends
I wanna see a whole lot of licking, that's a memory
Yeah, bet I make that pussy remember me

Too dangerous, too dangerous

[Verse 2: Smoke]
K is nothing new to me, so hate on, hate on
My eighty-year old twin sisters, same ol', same ol'
It's clearer than unicorn having glitter but six
With a fairy, skiing down that double rainbow
Range Rove, no shoes, the truck got the bare feet out
No more Ramen Noodles, like a dike I go and eat out
I'm bald headed, but still Nappy Boy is the click
Like game in sex, we the shit on a stick (pause)
My Chevrolet Camaro's high yellower than that nigga Drake
Rims blacker than Wesley Snipes, I'm sitting on blades
Like a barn on fire, I'm burning heavy hay
And Smoke stands for smoke, loads'a kush everyday

[Chorus]
If I'm lying, I'm down, I'm the bidness
Throw me in the jungle with a lion, Imma kill it
Die hard nigga, call me Bruce Willis
No time for fake shit, homeboy I'm the realest nigga

You can't see me, no, I'm too dangerous
Too dangerous, too dangerous

[Verse 3: Shawn Jay]
They ask me what happen with Field Mob, I say two different egos clashing
Like Andre 3K and CeeLo's fashion
Got micro-smoke dose responds with so outrageous
Ya girl say Shawn Jay, ya smoke my favorite
I got her up in MySpace, smoking my grape kush
She follow me like I'm Twitter, then I poke her like Facebook
Realest nigga ever known, killin' every song

Too dangerous, too dangerous

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
My head's killing me, I'm losing sleep
And I'm waking up tired of it all
Early in the morning and it's starting already
Why my name always involved?
I'm tryna get rid of the baggage
Fake friends I call them "has-been"s
Yeah, they lying on stuff
And I don't care if you don't show me love, no

[Pre-Chorus]
They want me to lie down
They want me to crawl, uh-uh, uh-uh
They want me to cry now, uh-uh, uh-uh
But I'm never falling off

[Chorus]
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
Too damn grown (Yeah), I don't owe nobody (Ow!)
Get off of me (Haha), yeah, get off of me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Tell me what I gotta do
I'm tryna make it clear to you
Not dealing with the attitude
I'm tired of tryna make you see that I'm still me
Switched up my longitude and latitude
You're in my way, you better move
Ignoring everyone that's tryna bring me down
Oh, baby, oh, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
They want me to lie down
They want me to crawl, uh-uh, uh-uh
They want me to cry now, uh-uh, uh-uh

[Hook: x2]
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?

[Verse 1]
Here's a little story that I got to tell about a young motha'fucka that done went through hell
He started off in Tallahassee, Florida
Hoping that somebody would save him from the boredom
He started making beats for the locals, stacking bread
And joined up with the clique called the Nappy Headz
The money came slow, but the hate came quick
Talking behind his back, like "Pain ain't shit!"
He was going out of town just to put it on stage
Blind to the fact that he wouldn't get paid
Slept in the car, clothes in the back seat
Twenty dollars to get them hoes in the back seat
Got tired of that, then he set some goals
Hoping this rap shit'll get him some gold
Oh, never thinking of what he 'bout to be
Then six years later, everybody copy me, ya see me?

[Hook: x2]
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?

[Verse 2]
One faithful day, he said fuck it
Hopped in the Chevrolet bucket
Then he went to Mickey D's, got an application
Nowhere was just where this rap will take him
So he gave up, took the paper home
Four dollars an hour, that's paper hoe
But he ain't too grown, so he got no bills
No condos just enough to make it home
Then all ring-ring on the mobile phone
Area code said "404"
"Oh yo this Akon what up nigga? Man, yo shit sound good"
Shut up nigga! Click
Just leave me the fuck alone
And somebody better quit playin' on my fuckin' phone
And then he said "Naw, this is what I'm 'bout to do
Have everybody copyin' you, ya see me like"

[Hook: x2]
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?

[Verse 3]
Took tens in the bucket man fuck it I'm taking my black ass to the ATL
And I'm a make it there in three and a half hours even if I gotta go through hell
Now I can't tell that this is the kind of tours that I should be making all by myself
But Imma commit suicide if I see another untalented nigga on the Best Buy shelf
Well, hooked up with Akon and Boubacar
Sat down at a pizza parlor
It's kinda hard trynna explain who you are
When you showed up getting off the market
And so I showed them niggas a couple DVD's CD's
Showing the shit I did on TV
Cause I sucked at basketball
But this is way better after all, see me like

[Hook: x2]
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?

F-Y-R-E, Pain
Ok, I ain't gotta tell ya on the track baby
Danger, danger (this shit is)
Danger, danger (this shit is)
Danger, danger, danger, danger

[Verse 1]
Man, I'm so spectacular I manufacture hits like Hit Factory
I'm on my shit so tell that bitch to get back from me
Mack black Cadillac's and G's
So many them hoes be running after me
We might need a limos worth of backseats
Cause all in my shotgun be ridin shotgun
For niggas that's looking at me wrong like a hot nun
It's obvious these dumb hoes don't get it yet
Fuckin around with Pain and get pwned on the internet
This shit I'm doing is illegal like three murders
So put'cha bread up I got beef like three burgers
Lick shots a make ya team jump like three hurdles
You niggas weird and slow and I'm smarter than Steve Urkel
See me?

[Interlude]
Danger, danger, danger, danger

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they say that boy got the bar on his neck
Advertising for other niggas and they ain't got off of the check
Cause I ain't looking for no money, I'm just cool like that
Na, now they don't teach you nothin' in yo school like that
So these niggas mad 'cause I dropped out, but I still got paid
And how I keep my face clean, but I still got maids
How I unmanaged the dreads and how I get my braids
But I'm awesome, so you can't say that shit 'bout Pain
See me?

[Interlude]
Danger, danger, danger, danger

[Verse 3]
I'm a keep it going like a marathon, A Merry-Go-Round
If Mary make it to my room, then Mary-Go-Down
Hold up. slow down, I bet'cha know now
Old-fashion show down with a new fashion 4-pound
Yeah, show some respect in this bitch
You getting stacks of money, I get stacks of checks in this bitch
Nigga, it's about to be a train wreck in this bitch
My niggas ready, that's why all of 'em sweating and shit
I got another group of niggas that'll make ya leave
Instead of putting on ya act, that's just make believe
Maybe it's all of this money, maybe the ice on my wrist
Maybe the Phantom outside, maybe it's Maybelline
See me?!

[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Teddy, uh, uh

[Verse 1 + Ad-Libs]
All you gotta do is call 1-9 hunned (hunned)
Son I'm stunnin' (stunnin')
You just a miscarriage (what?)
Son not coming (With what?)
With nothing, bitch I'm sweet now
This nigga's big enough to make a sticked-up cheeck sound (goddamn!)
Teddy Propane (pain)
Lyrical cocaine
Custom made outfit (yeah)
Flyer than four planes (woah!)
How could you deny the genius of my work ethic (damn)
Cause all you crazy ass niggas that need to work edit (yeah)
I need to take my medication on the daily basis
I got some shit inside of me and I can't wait to say this
Cause I'm a lose a lot of friends in the process
But this the ones that been fucking up all my progress
But I digress and you die slow
I ain't ate enough rappers, I need 'bout five mo'
But before I style on 'em, let me cover up
Cause I don't want no rap stains on my button-up (Yeah)

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Man I got way to many cars to let the hatin' get to me
Especially when I know you ain't gone bring the shit to me
So on and so forth, I'm so on and so forceful
Young Fyre kick drums, leave a print of a horse shoe
Everywhere I go, my shit getting played cause
I ain't in the hood, I stay in the rave clubs
Keep using them big words that I don't understand
I take it as disrespect, then turn your face to a cave cuz
Now that's stupid from a couple aspects
But so is rollin' up weed with my publishing checks
You don't think Nappy Boy is the clique, or T-Pain is the shit
You must be snorting on some fucking anthrax
Now that's old school white shit
My tongue wearing skinny jeans, my flow on that tight shit
Love from a nigga is the only thing I might get
Everything else, I got; if not, I'll buy it, now try this

[Chorus; One Chance]
I surrounded by so much hate
Ain't gone let another take my place
I'm sick and tired of all these lies
Ya'll niggas ain't felt no pain

[Verse 2; T-Pain]

[Verse 1]
Look at him spittin' rhymes, look at him hittin' dimes
Travelin' all around the world. world, uh
Look at him hit the stage, look at him rip the place
For grown women and little girls, girls, uh
But at the same time, he's doing the same thang
Remember 05, well this the same Pain
But every time the rap game go down the drain
The Louis Vutton jewelry box allowing him to change lanes
I'm here to change things, but they don't like diversity
Until they ask to let somebody write a verse for me
But I say hell naw
Fuck them niggas and they Benz, tell em I don't see em like Patti Labelle draws
I wanna make a living, and niggas want me buried
So I told Dex to put me in the pet cemetery
So I can come back out of the dirt and truly thank him
And tell em how Jesus introduced me to Ben Franklin

[Interlude]
You basically empowered
Most of us that have it
The holy goal with no man has ever gone before
He has, He has, He has giving us a stiff
And the average human being does not care

[Verse 2]
How hard is it to make it? And ya fuckin respect it
It seems like you just get in this shit to get rejected (your outta here!)
And in some cases I done caught my damn self
Hating on another nigga just because he gettin' sweaty
Uh, this shit is hard as it'll ever get
It's like waiting to fuck a girl that you'll never hit
And every time you walk out the bitter with blue balls
Then go and waste your money on making your Chevy too tall, damn
The life I live is full of public secrets
And I'm the blame even if they didn't fuckin see it
A modern day Frederick Douglas, how can you believe it
Like Sadatay, Pootie Tang use the belt to beat it
Man, if you wanna lose, then nigga go 'head
But ain't nobody ever goin say Pain got a slow head
Unless I'm in the dressing room getting me some slow head
Fucking with a seven or like seven of a co-ed's
Uh

[Outro]
... did his own crew
Everybody wants to get his old crew rich
And then they want the other lil people never get a piece of the pie
And that can only go for the cracker, that go for you niggas that think that y'all big too
I understand this, that's right you niggas and crackers can't stand me
You niggas must know that I know you can't do nothing if you broke
Listen to me young people, old people too, mostly black people I'm talking to you
You can't do nothing if you broke!

[Verse]
Now I done got a lil older, flow got colder
Baby I'm rich put ya head on my shoulder
So before ya come to the crib
I'm a take you to the mode and give you a one sover (Feel good don't it?)
I'm a put you on it
You ain't never gonna get off, get off, get off (Bout that hood honey)
Gotta take you for a test drive
Come on take that shit off, shit off, shit off

[Chorus]
And I bet that you the best right
I'm about to take you for a test drive
Hey, show me what'cha head rest like
I'm about to take you for a test drive
Hey, highbeams on ya headlights
I'm about to take you for a test drive, baby
Hey, making love at the red light
I'm about to take you for a test drive

Heard the world is ending soon I assumed that they told ya

So don't be coming 'round Vince
On that batter ram shit
On that 911 shit

Don't stop, bitch, stay focused
They hated on us since days of Moses
Let my people go crazy
Them stars falling, don't chase 'em

Attack on Iraq
It's on a line
Typing it fast
Then it's slipping my mind
Oh, when I'm drunk
I'm spirited back
I fall in a fire then I save myself
Then I get advantage
'Cause the feeling's so raw
In these times of sedition
Well, nothing is dull
And I'm moving into stillness
And recalling it all
And I’m a lover, just a lover, just a lover, just a lover, just a-

All these liberated women sitting in my lap
I'm finna catch a body like I got a gun and badge
I'm finna turn Obama to my partner 'fore he dash
Pull up to the pad, wipe my ass with the flag
I'm just playing, baby, this the land of the free
Where you can get a Glock and a gram for the cheap
Where you can live your dreams long as you don't look like me
Be a puppet on a string, hanging from a fucking tree
(Aghh!)

[Chorus: Vince Staples & (The Humanz)]
The sky's falling, baby
Drop that ass 'fore it crash (higher)

[Verse 1: Kelela]
Don't try to hide away
You know you've been on
Though I'm keeping calm, I'm not on
Go away, my love
Thought I could change our fate
I tried again, but this delay
It's more than I can take

[Chorus: Kelela]
And it got to me
When you state your love
And you walk away
What could you be on?
Now you're not around
But I hope you see
I will be full-on
If it's up to me
It's all I got

[Verse 2: Kelela]
Feels so good doing me
If you take a look at the time you took and move on
But don't go too far, my lover
We could try harder, baby
There's gotta be a better way
So much that we could make it

[Chorus: Kelela]
And it got to me
When you state your love
But you run away
What could you be on?
Now you're not around
But I hope you see
Gotta be full-on
It is up to me
It's all I got

It's all I got

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Wish I could think of better ways
'Cause I lost my patience yesterday
If you could see inside of me
There'd be no heart on my X-ray
Opponents tryna checkmate
But I don't see no escape
Just tryna keep my head straight
On thin ice with the ice skates
At times, I feel like givin' up
'Cause it feels like I've had enough
Felt like my soul in handcuffs
Got questions with no answers
Can't help me out, I need a friend
I'm losin' faith in this world of sin
Tryna make ends meet with a week, no sleep
It's like a cycle that never ends
I can't contend with no handlin'
I can't take care of no grown man
All by myself, cryin' for help
But won't get saved by no Superman
All comes down to the mighty dollar
Greed and lust, abusin' power
Clock is tickin', hour after hour
Maybe when I throw my hands, I'll holla

[Chorus: Kelela]
And you got to me
When you state your love
But you run away
What could you be on?
Now you're not around
But I hope you see
Gotta be full-on
It is up to me

And well in that case, how do you know it's your own?

You didn't care, no truth and no dare
In the bathroom, blow everywhere
Now you're so high, kiss all the guys
Making me jealous, I wonder why

[Chorus: 2-D]
I drove the keys
I drove the keys
In the seas of your priority
Dissolve the keys
Dissolve the keys
In the seas of your priorities

[Outro: Zebra Kats, Jamie Principle & 2-D]
Sex murder
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Sex murder party
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder, murder

[Intro: Little Simz]
Oh, palace flows
Rain falls from the heavens to my palace rooftop
When the light shines through it I feel more exposed
Will it ever change here? We'll just never know
Stimulation, I'm in need of
See the time is of the essence and this clock doesn't own a home
Rain falls from the heavens to my palace rooftop
When the light shines through I feel more exposed

[Verse 1: Little Simz]
In tune, with myself on it, my mind is my weakness
With your strength, you might surprise yourself
Never deny yourself, I live in the space is my thesis
I know you need this, I know you need this
I'm prone to run out of pieces
That might connect to something bigger
All in your mind, could follow me, you should consider
Look at the time, I'm probably later than ever
"What did you find?" Well come in here, and lit it with pressure
I look to the heavens and I saw open gates
I walked up and then I paused
What the fuck did you do this for?
Wish me luck when that midnight falls
Memories of a past life
Can this be? This is our time, can this be? This is our time
Come on

[Verse 2: Little Simz]
In stillness, known to the world, do you feel this?
Trapped in my mind, hope I can find solitude
When connecting all of these pieces
I know you need this, I know you need this
I fold and unleash the beast
Unknown is what I would be
If my whole purpose here wasn't to speak
Now look at the time, I know that I am early today
What did you find when giving up and running away?
I gazed to the stars and this view can't be shared
When there are no other eyes in this room
Mean the words when you sing your tune
Free as a bird when I intake fumes
Memories of this past life
Can this be? This is our time, can this be? This is our time
Come on

[Ben Mendelsohn]
And out of the elephant's trunk...
Confetti

(Transition)

[Verse 1: Benjamin Clementine]
Here is our tree
That primitively grows
And when you go to bed
Scarecrows from the far east
Come to eat
Its tender fruits
And I thought the best way to protect our tree
Is by building walls
Walls like unicorns
In full glory
And galore
And even stronger
Than the walls of Jericho
But glad then my friend
Out in the field we shall reap a better day
What we have always dreamt of having
Are now for the starving
It is love, that is the root of all evil
But not our tree
And thank you my friend
For trusting me

[Chorus: Benjamin Clementine & (Choir)]
Hallelujah
(Hallelujah)
Hallelujah money
(Past the chemtrails)
Hallelujah money
(Hallelujah money)
Hallelujah money
(Hallelujah money)
Hmmm
Hallelujah money
(Hallelujah)
Hallelujah money
(Oooh)

[Bridge: 2-D]
How will we know?
When the morning comes
We are still human
How will we know?
How will we dream?
How will we love?
How will we know?

[Verse 2: Benjamin Clementine]
Don't worry, my friend
If this be the end, then so shall it be
Until we say so, nothing will move
Ah, don't worry
It's not against our morals
It's legally tender
Touch my friend
While the whole world
And whole beasts of nations desire
Power

[Bridge 2: 2-D]
When the morning comes
We are still human
How will we know?
How will we dream?
How will we love?
How will we know?

[Chorus: Benjamin Clementine & (Choir)]
(Hallelujah money)
Hallelujah money
(Past the chemtrails)
Hallelujah money
(Hallelujah money)
Hmmm
Hallelujah money
(Hallelujah money)
Hallelujah money
(Oooh)
Hallelujah money
Hallelujah money
Hallelujah
Hallelujah money!

[Chorus]
Grilling with his face, oh jesus!

Grilling with his face, oh jesus!
Grilling with his face, oh here I come!
Grilling with his face, grilling with his face
Grilling with his face

[Intro]
Burn up with the water
The floods are on the plains
The planets in rows
Who knows what they contain?
And my brain is like an orchestra
Playing on, insane
Will you love me like you loved me in the January rain?

[Verse 1]
Mom and Dad and violins
Somber country silence
The needle stopped the kicking
The clothes pins on the floor
And my heart is playing hide and seek
Wait and count to four
Will you love me like you loved me and I'll never ask for more

[Bridge]
What did you tell me Mary
When you were there so sweet and very
Full of field and stars
You carried all of time
Oh and, heavens, when you looked at me
Your eyes were like machinery
Your hands were making artifacts in the corner of my mind

[Chorus]
Monastery monochrome
Boom balloon machine and oh
Diamond rings and gutter bones
Marching up the mountain
With our aching planning, high and smiling
Cheap drink, dark and violent
Full of butterflies, the violent tenderness
The sweet asylum
The clay you find is fortified
We felt unfocused fade the line
The sugar rush, the constant hush
The pushing of the water gush
The marching band when April ran
May June bugs fly and
Push your gin Jacob
With the tired wiry brandy look
Here we go round, Mary
In your famous story book

[Verse 2]
We overcome the sirens
We look both left and right
And I can feel the numbness accompany my plight
And I know that someday soon I'll see you
But now you're out of sight
And you'll kiss me like you used to in the January night

[Bridge]
What did you tell me Mary
When you were there so sweet and very
Full of field and stars
You carried all of time
Oh and, heavens, when you looked at me
Your eyes were like machinery
Your hands were making artifacts in the corner of my mind

[Chorus]
Monastery monochrome
Boom balloon machine and oh
Diamond rings and gutter bones
Marching up the mountain
With our aching planning, high and smiling
Cheap drink, dark and violent
Full of butterflies, the violent tenderness
The sweet asylum
The clay you find is fortified
We felt unfocused fade the line
The sugar rush, the constant hush
The pushing of the water gush
The marching band when April ran
May June bugs fly and
Push your gin Jacob
With the tired wiry brandy look
Here we go round, Mary
In your famous story book

[Verse 1]
Tryna keep my sanity, losing my mind
Don't know what you've done to me and I don't know why
All eyes are on us, look around
Your eyes are the reason you stand out in the crowd

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'ma buy a dime and you gon' get a stone
What it's gon' be, you gon' be my wifey, yeah
Woah-oh, yeah, yeah
What I call a house, you can call a home
Burn it down, don't throw me out
‘Cause all I want is you, woah

[Chorus]
Girl, you're made of gold (Made of gold)
Girl, your smile lights up the sky
You're beautiful, oh, oh, you're beautiful
It's impossible (Impossible)
Girl, you're burning hot like fire
Made of gold, made of gold
Burning hot

[Post-Chorus]
I think you wanna love me
I think you wanna love me, baby (Yeah, yeah)
I think you wanna love me
I think you wanna love me, baby
I think you wanna love me (Woah)
I think you wanna love me, baby
Girl, you're made of gold
Solid gold, baby

[Verse 2]
I'm getting ready, getting ready to break you off
Your body, baby, it's so amazing
You don't see that you're a star
Oh girl, your loving
I'm about to wear you out
Come closer, baby, wanna hold you, baby
Do you hear me, girl?

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'ma buy a dime and you gon' get a stone (Oh)
What it's gon' be, you gon' be my wifey, yeah (Be my wifey)
Woah-oh, yeah, yeah (Woah)
What I call a house, you can call a home
Burn it down, don't throw me out
‘Cause all I want is you, girl

[Chorus]
Girl, you're made of gold (Made of gold)
Girl, your smile lights up the sky
You're beautiful, oh, oh, you're beautiful
It's impossible (Impossible, yeah)
Girl, you're burning hot like fire (Ooh, baby)
Made of gold, made of gold (Oh, made of gold)
Burning hot

[Post-Chorus]
I think you wanna love me (Baby)
I think you wanna love me, baby (Oh, woah, yeah)
I think you wanna love me (Love me)
I think you wanna love me, baby (Love me, baby)
I think you wanna love me (Hey)
I think you wanna love me, baby (Oh, oh)
Girl, you're made of gold
Solid gold, baby

I thought you would want to stay
But you don't, I can't say it's over
How I wanted more than normal

She said tell me how it feels but I don't want to explain

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
It was twenty years ago today
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Chorus: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison]
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Bridge: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison]
It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought you might like to know
That the singer's gonna sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Outro: Paul McCartney]

George: Yeah, and what you could do with the bits where you can't get it 'cause you haven't got enough breath. You just don't...
Paul: You'll just take over, yeah?

The bit that John finally got, just after that, then we will do both of the do what you wanna do, do what you wanna do, do what you wanna do, do what you wanna do, do what you wanna do, do what you wanna do, do what you wanna do, do what you wanna do

OHB
Yeah, yeah, oh

[Verse 1]
Modified my living (Yeah)
Did it all for what? Just to keep you with me, yeah (Woo)
And everytime I tryna say some, you don't believe me (Nah)
Girl, you so damn cold, I've been down this road before

[Pre-Chorus]
I meant it, never again
That's on my city, never again
How am I supposed to trust you when your love's inconsistent?
But you've been going on and on 'bout commitment

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, commitment
God as my witness, commitment
Commitment, commitment

[Verse 2]
Yeah, so tired waiting, yeah
I need more patience, yeah
I'm sick of running around (Uh)
I need somebody around ('Round)
Grocery shopping around (Yuh)
Baby, you got a key to the house

[Pre-Chorus]
Never again, that's on my city, never again (Woah)
How am I supposed to trust you when your love's inconsistent?
But you've been going on and on 'bout commitment

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, commitment (Commitment)
God as my witness, commitment (Oh, oh, oh)
Commitment (Commitment), commitment (Hey! Ow!)

[Verse 3]
Living is living, cheating is cheating
Winning is winning
You won't be committed
But married to me like a federal sentence
I'ma handle my business, 'cause you make a difference
Don't see other bitches
You can't compare living
To finish each others sentences
And we got to go
Just looking back at all this shit that you did for me
I'm 'bout to buy this bitch a Rolls
Met her on internet, high but it weren't from the weed
We never beef, she always lie to police
That bitch a rider for me
And then when I put designer on her feet
I'ma cuff it, but I'm not the police

[Chorus]
Commitment
Yeah, yeah, commitment
God as my witness, commitment
Commitment, commitment

[Chorus]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
The moon is beautiful
The sun is even more beautiful
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm cool, super cool
Ladies see me, they drool
Yeah, I act a fool in school
And passed my tests because I'm cool
I'm too cool for you
I could've followed rules
But I didn't 'cause I couldn't
I was busy being cool
I'm too cool for a fool
To try and fool me
When I walk the hall
These ladies call my name from wall to wall
I'm a player, player
Player, player
Player, player
Let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's ride

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, I'm too cool
Oh yeah, I'm way too cool
Oh yeah, I'm just too cool
The moon is beautiful, that's right, that's me, baby
The sun is even more beautiful, that is me
Oh yeah, let's ride
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Pocket full of ice
Ice cubes 'cause I'm cool
When I dance, homies wanna do
But they know they can't 'cause I got the moves
Watch me slide to the left
Watch me slide to the right
Keep it cool on the summer night
Take a real then I gotta change your life
I'm too... cool
Let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's ride

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, told y'all I'm too cool for y'all
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm too cool
Oh yeah
The moon is beautiful, let's get it, let's get it, let's get it, let's ride
The sun is even more beautiful, that's me y'all, that's right, that's right
Oh yeah, let's get it, let's get it, let's get it, let's ride
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Hook: The-Dream & Travie McCoy]
I like girls
They like me
They look so cute in their 7 Jeans
Want you to be the one
And my only
I want to be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar

My hands, my hands, my haha... my hands
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha... my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha... my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
You see I got this problem
I need help trying to solve it
'Cuz meeting after meeting
And I'm still a cookie-holic
And I'm still a cookie-holic
You can hide 'em, I'ma find 'em
On the counter, in the closet
And I'll say I ain't do it
With my face covered in chocolate
My girl be setting booby traps
To catch me eating Scooby Snacks
I left crumbs in the bed once
But I told her I was through with that
She still don't be believing me
And I guess that I'm cool with that
But I got a sweet tooth
That'll never come loose
And the fact of the matter is

[Hook: The-Dream & Travie McCoy]
I like girls
They like me
They look so cute in their 7 Jeans
Want you to be the one
And my only
I want to be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar

My hands, my hands, my haha... my hands
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha... my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha... my
(Big shouts out to Gym Class Heroes!)
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar
(What up Travis!)
Cookie Jar!
Video out now, check me out in the video!

[Outro: Nick Santino and Clinton Sparks]
Hey whats up, this is Nick from A Rocket To The Moon, and I am just letting you know you are checking out my mixtape for a brand new song called Dakota, and it's coming out this fall so I hope you enjoy it
This is Clinton Sparks!

[Verse 1]
I've been told by a friend
Or at least, I wish he was
That I should go and find the best
I'm not sure what that consists

Chances are it's not gonna find me first
Gonna have to open my eyes
Discover things I don't wanna find

[Chorus]
But if you're the smartest man in the room
You're hanging with the wrong people
Yeah, you're hanging with the wrong people

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing wrong with knowin'
Way more than I should
That way, when I get the words
I'll know exactly where it hurts
Even though the comfort here feels like a home
I just can't stop right here
Still got a whole lot more years

[Chorus]
But if you're the smartest man in the room
You're hanging with the wrong people
Yeah, you're hanging with the wrong people

[Verse 3]
Maybe I took what you said just a little too far
Maybe I took it just far enough
To help me find my way up

[Chorus]
But if you're the smartest man in the room
You're hanging with the wrong people
Yeah, you're hanging with the wrong people
Yeah, you're hanging with the wrong
Hanging with the wrong people

[Verse]
You're holding me and holding back
I don't really care for that
Just you

There's a pause between every minute
Feeling like I need something
It's just you

[Chorus]
I know
I know
I know
I know you
You

I know
I know
I know
I know you
You

[Verse]
I'll quiet down, if it's what you want
I understand I'm not the only one
For you

So tell me what you're looking for
Is it a picture-perfect girl
For you?

[Chorus]
I know
I know
I know
I know you
You

I know
I know
I know
I know you
You

[Verse]
I'm here regardless of the pain
Don't ever tell me to go away
From you
When we're old and have to leave the Earth
I'll still remember all I've learned
From you

[Chorus]
I know
I know
I know
I know you
You

I know
I know
I know
I know you
You

I know
I know
I know
I know you
You

I know
I know
I know
I know you
You

[Verse 1]
Alone again
I could see somebody coming a mile in
I've lost so much more than I'll admit
So I'm just sitting here alone again

[Verse 2]
Alone again
Maybe I'll visit my dad this weekend
We haven't been that close since you stepped in
But now I've got so much time alone again

[Verse 3]
Alone again
My mind's empty as the room I'm sleeping in
I covered my window, now my plants are dead
So they know how I feel, alone again

[Verse 4]
Alone again
I'm tying my shoes for the fun of it
I'm talking to my dog, just crying
But the more I speak the more I feel alone again

[Outro]
What am I doing alone again?
How could you leave me alone again?
Alone again
Alone again

[Verse]
Lovers that live far apart
Need one another
But only have their postcards
I guess it doesn't work like that

[Verse]
The pitcher of the baseball team
Traded in his jersey
Doesn't want to leave
I guess it doesn't work like that
I guess it doesn't work like that

[Verse]
A collar around a dog's neck
His only identity
And he has no say in it
I guess it doesn't work like that

[Verse]
My sister is a hard worker
She doesn't deserve to be behind the counter
I guess it doesn't work like that
I guess it doesn't work like that

[Verse]
I've seen my mother in pain
Begging for her mom to remember her name
I guess it doesn't work like that
It never really works like that

[Verse]
I remember when you were talking about flying me out
I remember how it was easy to pick me out of the crowd
But I guess I just remember when

[Verse]
I remember when you were happy just to walk me to my car
I remember every song you wrote me and how it touched my heart
But I guess I just remember when

[Verse]
I remember when you told your brother and the way it made you feel
I remember telling my brothers I think this thing is real
But I guess I just remember when

[Verse]
I remember when I would see you and the way you'd look at me
I remember way before these casual greetings on the street
But I guess I just remember when

[Outro]
I can't help but to remember when
And I wonder if you remember when

[Verse]
Well I wonder what he's doing and if he's falling asleep
I wonder if the flight attendant's prettier than me
I know he's coming back, but I still didn't want him to leave
But it's not a sad thing
It's not a sad thing
It's not a sad thing at all

[Verse]
My dear grandmother watches birds every day
I can picture her at the window calling out their names
She's got no one else to talk to and I guess that keeps her sane
But it's not a sad thing
It's not a sad thing
It's not a sad thing at all

[Verse]
An overheard conversation from the table to my left
Explaining his tattoos and the ones he hasn't gotten yet
Some of them with meaning, but most of them with regret
But it's not a sad thing
It's not a sad thing
It's not a sad thing at all

[Outro]
No it's not a sad thing
It's not a sad thing
It's never a sad thing at all

[Verse]
It's not knowing who's about to leave
That makes it harder for you to speak
Someone told me to never let anyone go
'Cause you'll never know what you need

[Chorus]
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now

[Verse]
If you're anything like me
You'll miss the chance to say what you mean
When you're lonesome and everyone forgets that you're there
All we do is sit patiently

[Chorus]
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now

[Verse]
Well, the worst is when someone talks
In response, you say nothing at all
You're expected to solve all their pain
You just want them to back off

[Chorus]
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now
Go on and say it now

[Verse 1]
I drove to Tennessee
Just for him to kiss me
I tried too hard
Too hard

But he never took me out
We stayed shut up in his house
I tried too hard
Too hard

[Chorus]
He said
What's the point, dear?
What's the point, dear?
What's the point?
Yeah he said
What's the point, dear?
What's the point, dear?
What's the point?

[Verse 2]
Every song he'd sing
I'd pretend was for me
I tried too hard
Too hard

He kept me at arm's length
But close enough to play his game
I tried too hard
Too hard

[Chorus]
He said
What's the point, dear?
What's the point, dear?
What's the point?
Yeah he said
What's the point, dear?
What's the point, dear?
What's the point?

[Verse 3]
I haven't seen him since
We never talk like this
I tried too hard
Too hard
I'll always turn my head
When I drive by where he lived
I tried too hard
Too hard

[Chorus]
I thought
There's no point here
There's no point here
There's no point here
There's no point here
There's no point here
There's no point here
There's no point
My wish for Christmas, that family’s OK
My wish for Christmas, that the whole world is safe
My wish for Christmas, that love conquers hate
This is my Christmas wish for the holidays

My wish for Christmas, the homeless finds a home
My wish for Christmas, that we all just get along
My Christmas wish is the joy conquers pain
This is my Christmas wish for the holidays

My Christmas wish is someone to give a care
My Christmas wish is that Heaven answers prayers
‘Cause I never needed anything like I need the world to change
This is my Christmas wish for the holidays

I never needed anything like I need the world to change
This is my Christmas wish for the holidays
Yeah

[Verse 1]
From the opposite side of the window pane
I see family and friends
All alone in the cold, freezing rain
Is how I feel within

I'm comin' on somebody
Wish I had somebody
To bring me peace, love and shelter
She's gotta be someone
Who really needs someone
And this he really needs a her

[Chorus]
I'm just a snowman, lookin' for a snow girl
Someone who can share my snow world
I'm just a snowman, lookin' for a snow girl
And I want you to be my girl

[Verse 2]
As the snow is slowly falling down
My thoughts are burning within (Oh, how I need)
Oh how I need a snow angel around
A faithful lover and friend
Oh, comin' on somebody
Wish I had somebody
To bring me peace, love and shelter
She's gotta be someone
Who really needs someone
And this he really needs a her

[Chorus]
I'm just a snowman, lookin' for a snow girl
Someone who can share my snow world
I'm just a snowman, lookin' for a snow girl
And I want you to be my girl

[scatting]

[Bridge]
Someone tell Santa Claus
That I'm out here in this cold, yeah
And I need a present that can keep me warm, warm

[Chorus]
I'm just a snowman, lookin' for a snow girl
Someone who to share my snow world
I'm just a snowman, lookin' for a snow girl
And I want you to be my girl
I'm just a snowman, lookin' for a snow girl
(I really, really need somebody to share my snow world
To keep each other warm at night, so give me your love)
I'm just a snowman, lookin' for a snow girl
And I want you to be my girl

I'm just a snowman, lookin' for a snow girl
(Really need you, Christmas, really need you
Really, really, really need you)
I'm just a snowman, lookin' for a snow girl…
Mrs. Santa Claus

‘Cause I'm gonna spend this time to get into you
Mrs. Santa Claus
This year will be the year I make holiday love to you for Christmas
And you won't regret it, you won't forget it
Baby, just let me
Ooo girl, just let me unwrap you
See, your body will be my gift tonight, Mrs. Santa
And I promise that we'll deck all the halls
With shadows of you and me on the walls

Mrs. Santa
Oh, Merry Christmas

[Verse 1]
I never really believed in a Santa
And thought that all the fairytales were fake
And all these stories about love
And the moon and stars above
I would tell all of my friends it's just a phase
A silly phase
I used to think that joy was just a rumor
And happiness was all too much the same
Since the day that I found you
All of these things became true
Now dreams and all these things I can do
Merry Christmas, baby

Sorry I could not be there with you
But I pray everything is OK
I want you to know that I’m missing you
And my heart is with you though I'm far away
So tell me, how's the dog, house, family and friends?
I want you to let ‘em all know that I wish 'em well
And I promise I'll be coming home real soon
But while I'm gone just keep checking your mail

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm sending a lifetime of kisses
A world full of chocolate covered wishes
Sending you a letter full of hearts
Vowing that we will never part
Sending you the strength when times get tough
And just be on the lookout for my trust
‘Cause I'm sending my love for Christmas

[Verse 2]
Out of the window the snow is coming down
And it only makes me miss you more and more, more
So many memories of us all around the tree
And Grandpa would bring the presents through the door
And you and I, we done fooled the kids to fall asleep
So that we can grab us drinks and toast to what we have
Though reading this letter is tough
Just know I really miss you much
So think of me when you're putting the lights up
‘Cause, baby…

[Chorus]
I'm sending a lifetime of kisses
A world full of chocolate covered wishes
Sending you a letter full of hearts
Vowing that we will never part
Sending you the strength when times get tough
Just be on the lookout for my trust
Baby, ‘cause I'm sending my love for Christmas

[Bridge]
Baby, and every word that I wrote
Is a word closer to home
So I just want you to hold on
‘Cause it won't be long
For as long as I live
Your heart will be my greatest gift
This is your Christmas letter
Baby, from your Santa
Be on the lookout

[Chorus]
I'm sending a lifetime of kisses
A world full of chocolate covered wishes
Sending you a letter full of hearts
Vowing that we will never part
Sending you the strength when times get tough
And just be on the lookout for my trust
‘Cause I'm sending my love for Christmas

I'm sending a lifetime of kisses
A world full of chocolate covered wishes
Sending you a letter full of hearts
Vowing that we will never part
Sending you the strength when times get tough
And just be on the lookout for my trust
‘Cause I'm sending my love for Christmas
‘Cause I’m sending my love for Christmas
‘Cause I’m sending my love for Christmas

[Verse 1]
Winter's come, break out the Christmas Tree

Loved ones reaching out to see if loved ones OK, yeah

I turn 'round, somethings missing from my bed
Hang a frown, my baby left before I dressed

{Chorus}
She can't leave me here alone tonight

Sitting down, socks and sneakers on my feet
Hanging 'round, feeling far too ill to eat

{Chorus}
She can't leave me here alone tonight
She'll be gone, for long
She won't hold me tight

I’ll cuddle you and love you slow
Open arms waiting for you

[Verse 1]
If I could give Santa my wish list
Every single day would be Christmas
I’d send the whole world from me a box of peace, yeah
And if there were one thing I could stop
It would be the breaking of hearts
Then the world would sing in perfect harmony

[Chorus]
Hello, good morning, everyone
Mothers, daughters, fathers, sons
It’s about to be a joyous one
It’s Christmas Day, yeah
I’m so excited to open gifts
The spirit of Christmas, no denying it
And all the world is filled with cheer
‘Cause it’s Christmas Day, yeah

[Verse 2]
If I could decorate the perfect tree
Only would hang the love of you and me
Put it on display for the whole world to see, oh baby
Taking pictures for memory’s sake
Cuddle you by the fireplace
Then bring joy to the love that we both made, oh

[Chorus]
Hello, good morning, everyone
(Good morning, yeah)
Mothers, daughters, fathers, sons
It’s about to be a joyous one
It’s Christmas Day, yeah

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I'm painting the room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
There I will go

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong
Silly people run around, they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go

[Outro: Paul McCartney]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
Where it will go
I'm fixing a hole
Fixing a hole
Fixing a hole
Fixing a hole
And that's right

[Verse 1]
I'm uptight
Playing by the rules in this game of life
365 days on the grind
Something's stirring, I might need to unwind
Then, there's you
Texting me a little bubble of trouble
I've tried to ignore these thoughts that rumble
I think I'm bored of being so careful

[Pre-Chorus]
Big city lights
Got me flirting with fire
Tonight I'ma let my hair down
Have a few rounds and just let go

[Chorus]
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna lose control and forget with you
Like roulette (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Let's roll it (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Verse 2]
They say everything in moderation
And sometimes, you got to give in to temptation
So I drop a pin to my location
Let's roll the dice

[Pre-Chorus]
Big city lights
Got me flirting with fire
Tonight I'ma let my hair down
Have a few rounds and just let go

[Chorus]
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna lose control and forget with you
Oh, like roulette (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Let's roll it (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Like roulette (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Let's roll it (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Bridge]
So tonight, we test limits (Test limits)
Take the safety off for a minute (For a minute)
'Cause my love's a bullet with your name written on it
Just load it and spin it

[Chorus]
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you (Close my eyes with you)
Like roulette, ooh-ooh
Wanna lose control and forget with you (Lose control, lose control)
Like roulette (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Let's roll it (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

Like roulette (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

Wanna close my eyes and roll it with you

I don't wanna wake, wake

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Excuse me? Um, I love you
Who starts a conversation like that? Nobody but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up or hide you
I'll get you out my mind, hmm, I try to
Why you? In my dreams, I knew
You knew how to be there, you knew how to treat it
You knew how to keep it, I wanna do more than touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you up to
We can leave right now, nigga, you don't need a duffle
La Perla, provocateur of secrets
How is it a secret if I know you're gonna peep it?
I see you peeking, don't wanna hear a peep
Wait

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Pharrell Williams]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh

If you can believe?
Boy you're such a dream to me, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Hey there, boy, I love you
I'm feeling like I know you, I can't help but wanna thug you
I'm watching all these broads trying so damn hard
But I can't even blame 'em 'cause you're so irresistible
I want to stand and yell, I won't ever dare to tell
I think I heard some wedding bells (keep that to yourself)
Is this real?
Ooh child, I can stop praying now
Past life, let's rewind
To the day when I met you
Throwback
Dear God, how could I forget you?
Your sex
Boy, it feels just like a dream to me
Now

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Pharrell Williams]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh
Wake up, wake up, wake up
You're such a dream

If you can believe?
Boy you're such a dream to me, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
So to whom
It may concern
Please don't disturb me
Can't you see?
I'm happy, happily sleep, yeah

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Pharrell Williams]
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Yesterday my nigga had told me his brother died
A day before that his homeless uncle was cold outside
A week before he seen the cancer in his mother's eyes
Two weeks before that, couldn't pay his rent cause he lost his job
A month before that he lost the custody of his daughter
Six months before that her mother said she won't see her father
And this before he did a year when them charges brought up
I shook my head, turned around then found a $100

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar (x2)]
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why I don't know why I don't know why

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Yesterday I invaded privacy of a home
The day before that my partner had fronted me a zone
A week before I had loaded bullets inside that chrome
Two weeks before that I shot them bullets and he was gone
A month before that I cursed my mother then slammed the door
Six months before that I hit my woman, she hit the floor
I stormed out then seen a black Honda Accord
Them hollow tips missed me then hit that little boy

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar (x2)]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
So today I laid in my bed, stared at the ceiling
Closed my eyes then asked myself how I was feeling
I analyzed on how a saint can play the villain
Is my life coincidental or just God willing
I came to grips, jumped up, and looked out the window
See my nigga had that same little boy that didn't know
Bullets is nameless, I guess this is meant for
Me to give them a $100 then trash my pistol

[Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar (x2)]
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why, now I know why, now I know why

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar and BJ the Chicago Kid]
So I can bless you
So I can bless you
So I can bless you

[Verse 4: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Lord help me
Cause I need You
I know this weed is burning
And I'm on drink number two
But it's all to soothe the pain from this
Cold, cold world
Sometimes I think You can help me
But this bus here is temporary
So I'm talking to You
This sick world will drive a sane man crazy
Birds dropping out the sky, daughters having their fathers' babies
And this the news I hear
When my god kids, nieces, and nephews turn a year
I wonder, will it get better
A little cheddar, when it get better
But the rest of that's cash
Make last year's Christmas gift you, my bad

[Hook 3: BJ the Chicago Kid (x2)]
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow, but somehow, but somehow

[Verse 5: BJ the Chicago Kid]
If I just keep the faith
I know You'll be right there
Sometimes it may not seem that You are there
But You're there
I feel You're there
You're everywhere
And I thank You for
Protecting me in these streets
From danger seen and unseen
I never know
What happened the night
I wasn't there
Something told me leave so I left
It was the next morning
Three got shot after the club
All listening to that small voice
Oh you saved my life

[Verse 1]
Stuck inside my head
Like a song you can't forget
So don't be so uptight
We can leave that all behind, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You and me tonight
What I do? Yeah, feel so crazy, right?
What I do? Let me play with you tonight
‘Cause it's you that I wanna, ey
(One, two, three, four)

Oh, I want the Earth to move
All night when I dance with you

All night when I dance with you
Oh, I want the Earth to move
All night, all night, all night

Please don't turn to stone
‘Cause when you move it turns me on
I know what’s on your mind
‘Cause it’s the same thing that’s on mine, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You and me tonight
What I do? Yeah, feel so crazy, right?
What I do? Let me play with you tonight
Cause it's you that I wanna, ey

Oh, I want the Earth to move

It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms, yeah

If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end (I might)

Now all my pockets is on Norbit

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
They mad 'cause we grinded up from the top

And we will never stop, the game on Buscemi lock

Sippin' on Bud, like givin' you advice I'm actin' white
Mansion on acres, my white friends I only invite

[Verse 1]
Yeah, there's tension in every speck of the air
Yeah, I feel like we’re close and there's no time to spare
Oh-oh, who’s gonna win when we’re not playing fair-air? Oh

[Chorus]
I-I-I-I-I, I feel alone sometimes
I-I-I-I-I, I wanna find what’s missing
Can you still fight?
So you know what I’m feeling inside
No, no, no

[Post-Chorus]
Enough is enough, can we put out the fire?
We all gotta change for us to transpire
What will it take for us to come together?
We must face our fears and love each other

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, can you hear me, hear me?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, can you hear me, hear me?
We just need to feel the love that's spreading ‘round, 'round through the air
Like oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, can you hear me, hear me?

[Verse 2]
Tell me why, oh
Why can’t we seem to let it go? Yeah
If we try, oh yeah, to give our all and just a little more
A little more, more

[Chorus]
I-I-I-I-I, I feel alone sometimes
I-I-I-I-I, I wanna find what’s missing
Can you still fight?
So you know what I’m feeling inside
No, no, no

[Post-Chorus]
Enough is enough, can we put out the fire? (Fire)
We all gotta change for us to transpire, woo
What will it take for us to come together now?
We must face our fears and love each other (Fears, ow!)

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, can you hear me, hear me now?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, can you hear me, hear me? (Can you hear me? Oh)
We just need to feel the love that's spreading ‘round, 'round through the air
Like oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, can you hear me, hear me?

[Outro]
Can you, baby? Can you, baby?
Oh, oh, can you, baby?
Oh, oh, can you, baby?
Can you, baby? Can you, baby?
Oh, oh, can you, baby?

[Verse 1]
This is the first day of my life
Swear I was born right in the doorway
Went out in the rain, suddenly everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach
Yours is the first face that I saw
Think I was blind before I met you
Don't know where I am
Don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go

[Chorus 1]
So I thought I'd let you know
That these things take forever, I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wonder if I could come home

[Verse 2]
Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning?
I thought it was strange, you said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up
And you said, "This is the first day of my life
I didn't die before I met you
But now, I don't care, I could go anywhere with you
And I'd probably be happy"

[Chorus 2]
So if you want to be with me
With these things, there's no telling
We just have to wait and see
But I'm working for a paycheck
Instead of waiting to win the lottery

[Chorus: Tyga]
Uhh, I got a pornstar's tenacity
Fuck her like it's ten of me, I've been a nasty nigga
Nigga, I got a dope boy's tenacity
Cocky like I got ten ki’s and they harassing me
Woo, super freak in my passenger
She a superstar and got it bad for me
If I hang up, she call right back to me
You cut her legs off, she crawl right back to me

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uh, addicted like crack to my tenacity
I made a path for all my savages, I'm business savy, see
It must be March 'cause y'all mad at me
It's March Madness and I ball like Kansas City
You against me and the city
You know how many pretty bitches drove me to liquor stores
For condoms and sour liquor straws
I get 'em hot Cheetos just to see her lick her fingers

[Chorus: Tyga]
Your boy been had a playboy's tenacity
Fuck her like it's ten of me, I've been a nasty nigga
Nigga, I got a dope boy's tenacity
Cocky like I got ten ki’s and they harassing me
Woo, super freak in my passenger
She a superstar and got it bad for me
If I hang up, she call right back to me
You cut her legs off, she crawl right back to me

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Actually, she really crawl
Lift my balls and lick the whole sack for me
Playboy tenacity, umbrellas in my Daiquiri
If I ain't poppin', why the paparazzi flashin' me?
Can you answer me?
I call it playboy's tenacity
Yeah, that's what it is, that's what it has to be
Yeah, look how I live, this how it had to be (hahh)
I want it now more than ever
More money, more problems but the money make it better
I ain't tryna fuck and that just fucked her head up
I'm sick, what's the diagnosis? That's why I wrote this
You know bitch

[Chorus: Tyga]
I got a playboy's tenacity
Fuck her like it's ten of me, I've been a nasty nigga
Nigga, I got a dope boy's tenacity
Cocky like I got ten ki’s and they harassing me

Possible drug trafficking suspect

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
Racing wing on the GT4
I'm finna drive this motherfucker to the ocean floor
Cold world, long nights with my old girl
If I put a baby in her, hope she don't abort
I found Atlantis in Atlanta at a strip club
Body was the palace, or maybe it was Venice
Excuse me if I'm scattered, but switching all these timezones
Really leave your mind gone if you don't mind me asking
Can you put your hands on your hips? Baby dip, dip, dip
Put your shoes on the bed, she my whip, I'ma trip
Windows got tint so you can wear whatever you like
And less is more, the funny thing about life
Is that the clock keep tickin', so let's have a good time
And time is of the essence, you should get undressed and that's fine
And do whatever you could think to take the stress off your mind
And if you need it, well, believe it, you could do it all night, alright
Woo!

Lilacs in my mind all the time are blooming beautifully
Even though some stare and say her last affair went brutally
Well, I don't let them rain on my parade
That's not my thing
'Cause I've got love on my side, now
I've got nothing to hide, now
And now life's a dream
Life's a dream

Sledgren
PJ
Oh, you think you get all the girls
Think you're so cute

[Verse: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, sometimes I just wanna get high
Not pick up my phone
Not be concerned with the bullshit that's goin' on
Get my paper long
Stack it all up with my bad bitch, who could clear the bong
Maybe hit the booth and make a song
Make sure my money hit the roof before I'm gone
One touch, the roof is in the trunk
No blunts, I'm only rollin' papers when I puff
The sky's the limit
It's time to get it
Multiplyin' them digits
While supplyin' that real shit
Don't get dismissed
Lil' nigga, hit this

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Still do what I want
You do what you can
That's why I ride around
Feeling like the man
If you feel the same
Then you understand
They get mad but I still do what I want
Still do what I want
You do what you can
That's why I ride around
Feeling like the man
If you feel the same
Then you understand
They get mad but I still do what I want

[Outro]
Oh, non smokers, please leave the flight
Those not in possession of bomb weed
Are in violation of code 420
And will be removed immediately
Non compliance with the rules is not accepted
And violators will be punished
Thank you niggas

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa & (Sledgren)]

[Chorus: Chevy Woods]
New phone, who is this?
Sushi with my newest bitch
Miss me with the stupid shit, wow
4 chains on me now
Pull up, make a crowd
Baby, can you roll this loud? Wow
Whole crew bossin' up
Don't you get to trippin', girl
A.I., cross you up, wow
Sledgren, this a stupid beat
Takin' trips, every week
Hit it once, never speak, wow

[Verse: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, can I ask you a question?
Can I get high without the stressin'?
Do you like me 'cause my possessions?
Don't you know this my progression?
Nothin' but KK in my session
I'm in the hills, don't got reception
Girl, let's have this conversation, you get naked
Watch some Netflix and just kick it like in Tekken
Hear the beat, that's made by Sledgren
Indeed, all my closet stuffed and full of Presidents
The weed smoke is the evidence
Knew it was us from the ashes left on the rug, hello?

[Chorus: Chevy Woods]
New phone, who is this?
Sushi with my newest bitch
Miss me with the stupid shit, wow
4 chains on me now
Pull up, make a crowd
Baby, can you roll this loud? Wow
Whole crew bossin' up
Don't you get to trippin', girl
A.I., cross you up, wow
Sledgren, this a stupid beat
Takin' trips, every week
Hit it once, never speak, wow

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I keep throwing money with no problems
I can feel, with more money, more problems
I think that it could be worse without it
I think that it could be worse without it
I think that it could be worse without it
I think that it could be worse without it

[Verse: Wiz Khalifa]
I be blowin' Kush up where the clouds is
I be going shoppin', ain't no browsing
I take your bitch and show her around then
I be so high, don't know where the ground is
Roll one up if it's 'bout cash then I'm showin' up
'Cause I remember days that they doubted

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I keep throwing money with no problems
I can feel, with more money, more problems
I think that it could be worse without it
I think that it could be worse without it
I think that it could be worse without it
I think that it could be worse without it

[Outro]
This is your pilot, Captain EZ Wider
It's gonna be a smooth but bumpy ride
And I say that because
There's some real niggas in this plane, y'all
And I advise you not to bring any fake weed
Boof weed, bad weed, blunts, backwoods, frontwoods
Swisha sweets or Swisha sours on this plane
Make sure to have your seat belts tight and your weed rolled right
'Cause we will begin busy on this plane y'all
It's W-E-E-D airlines, where everybody flies high
And we gon' ride in the rolling papers too in style
It's gon' be a smooth landing, y'all
Wiz Khalifa's gon' be right there waiting for y'all, I promise
Captain EZ Wider is gon' get y'all there

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
They don't make 'em like me (they don't make 'em like me)
They don't make 'em like me (they don't make 'em like me)
Prolly watch me, like me (prolly watch me, like me)
Trynna' be just like me (tryna be just like me)
They don't make 'em like me (like me)
They don't make 'em like me (like me)
Prolly watch me, like me (like me)
Tryna be just like me (like me)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
(Oh, you just gon' get on top of me like that?)
Hellcat, they keep askin' what the hell is that
Green and black, rockin' Gucci like I brought it back
Need a pack, put this KK in your bra strap
Always workin', never sleep, no, I don't relax
Niggas sayin' Young Khalifa got the dope raps
Ain't just started gettin' dressed, I'm freshin' on my throwbacks
I let her drive the new whip, I pull out the old scoop
They don't even touch the paper 'cause they old news
Young nigga wanna be like me
Front but he don't even like me
She all up on me like icing
My chain in the color of lightnin'
I got hella paper
Said this goin' down, she fucked me in the elevator

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
They don't make 'em like me (they don't make 'em like me)
They don't make 'em like me (they don't make 'em like me)
Prolly watch me, like me (prolly watch me, like me)
Tryna be just like me (tryna be just like me)
They don't make 'em like me (like me)
They don't make 'em like me (like me)
Prolly watch me, like me (like me)
Tryna be just like me (like me)

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
Go ask your chick just how I'm mobbin', she ain't feelin' you (shit)
She talk too much, I told her give this dick an interview (dick)
And she a project bitch so she ain't got no manners
She know what the fuck she want so them hoes can't stand her
She know I'm ballin', I ain't callin', that's your man's job (hello?)
Hands free when she suck it, keep her hands off
She just a thot, I get the top and then I smash off
My chain and watch, they do the wop and that's a dance off (what?)
Look we got pistols too (pistols) 'cause we got issues too (boom)
But she just fuck the stick, she know I'm comin' through
Uh, hold a baby, ain't no runnin' plans
Chopper City on my way, you know just how I'm comin'

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
They don't make 'em like me (they don't make 'em like me)
They don't make 'em like me (they don't make 'em like me)
Prolly watch me, like me (prolly watch me, like me)
Tryna be just like me (tryna be just like me)
They don't make 'em like me (like me)
They don't make 'em like me (like me)
Prolly watch me, like me (like me)
Tryna be just like me (like me)

John: For the benefit of Mr. Kite
John: Ice water
Paul: One, two, one, two, three, four

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In his way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishops gate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill

Without Henry!
Three, four

Three, four

George Martin: Don't shout it out, though, John, just mouth it
John: Well, alright
George Martin: You'll hear it, though, I mean, it'll be on the bass
John: Well, we'll have the massed Alberts on by then, won't we? Two, three, four
Take 2!

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave, doo-be-doo

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Whoo!

[Speech]
John: My guitar still seems to go in and out like it's--like the lead's wrong
John: I did a freak out one then, one of them where you don't know what you're doing, just a funny

Paul: Keep that one
John: Alright, let's go
Paul: One, two, three, four
Paul: Et laudate, cum una voce reclamamus, non nobis solum sed toti mundo nati

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man
Lovely Rita, meter maid
May I inquire discreetly
When are you free to take some tea with me?

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
Rita!

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home, I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
Oh, lovely Rita, meter maid
Where would I be without you?
Give us a wink and make me think of you

[Outro: Paul McCartney]
Lovely meter maid
Rita, meter maid
Oh Lovely Rita meter, meter maid

John: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, I refuse to go
Good morning
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day, how's your boy been
Nothing to do it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say, but it's OK

[Bridge: John Lennon]
People running round it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and meet the wife

[Verse 4: John Lennon]
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear
Go to a show, you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say, but it's OK

[Speech: Paul McCartney]
Seen all the shapes around the studio? And all those bubbles there, the bumps there? Okay! Keep the bass drum loud, keep the bass drum loud, bahw, yeah, oh is that what you were doing? Yeah, I know, yeah, it's 'c--, it's Ringo, it's 'cause you're listening to me singing, I'll stop singing though, you know
Okay
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!
One, two, three, four!

[Verse: Paul McCartney]

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
I saw a film today, oh, boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

[Interlude: Mal Evans]
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty

[Verse 3: Instrumental]

[Verse 4: John Lennon]
I read the news today, oh boy
Four-thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on

[Interlude: Mal Evans]
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think, er, no, I mean, er, yes, but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
One, two, three

[Intro: John Lennon]
It doesn't matter much to me

Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think, er, no, I mean, er, yes, but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to

Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about

[Verse 1: Rebecca Black]
All along it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said show me something
He said, "If you dare come a little closer

[Pre-Chorus: Rebecca Black]
'Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now, you know"

[Chorus: Rebecca Black]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

[Verse 2: Dave Days]
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given

[Pre-Chorus: Rebecca Black & Dave Days]
'Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now, you know"

[Chorus: Rebecca Black & Dave Days]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay
I want you to stay
I want you to stay
I want you to stay

[Verse 1]
Hello, hello? Baby, you called, I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you say, say?
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh? You're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy
K-kind of busy, k-kind of busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy

[Verse 2]
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kind of busy

[Pre-Chorus]
Kind of busy, kind of busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kind of busy

And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb

[Verse 3]
Not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight, I'm not taking no calls, 'cause I'll be dancing
Cause tonight I'm dancin' ('cause I'll be dancing)
Cause tonight I'm dancin' ('cause I'll be dancing)
Cause tonight I'm dancin' ('cause I'll be dancing)
Tonight I'm not taking no calls, 'cause I'll be dancing

All of the people start to rush (start to rush by)
A dizzy twister dance
Can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys?
I lost my phone, phone

[Pre-Chorus]
What's going on on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool
What's the name of this club?
I can't remember, but it's alright, alright

Just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-doo-doot-n, just dance
Spin that record, babe

Control your poison, babe
Roses have thorns, they say

Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic, got my blueprint, it's symphonic
Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic, got my blueprint, electronic
Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic, got my blueprint, it's symphonic
Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic, got my blueprint, electronic
Go!
Use your muscle, carve it out, work it, hustle
Don't slow!
Drive it, clean it, Lysol, bleed it
Spend the last dough in your pock-o

[Intro]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
You make me feel so pretty
When I'm not feeling so cool today
Yeah, you pull me out when you know that I'm afraid
Something about you
It dries up every tear in my way
And when I trip myself on the sidewalk
You put my boots back on me, babe
'Cause you're my cowboy, you're my everything
And you know how to get me

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm feeling up
Sometimes I'm down
You lift my feet up off the ground
Sometimes I'm moving fast
Sometimes I'm slow
You know, what'll make me go
Sometimes I am the happy girl  you love
Sometimes I don't feel good enough
Sometimes
Sometimes
Oh, you're there when I need you sometimes
Oh, oh
When I need you sometimes
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I ask myself these questions
About you that I cannot explain
How you ride with me when you know that I'm to blame
You've proved your love
I don't need to hear the words that you say
But I know you say them anyway
Just to keep me feeling sane
And my worries become yesterday
Baby, you get me

[Chorus]
Sometimes I'm feeling up
Sometimes I'm down
You lift my feet up off the ground
Sometimes I'm moving fast
Sometimes I'm slow
You know, what'll make me go
Sometimes I am the happy girl you love
Sometimes I don't feel good enough
Sometimes
Sometimes
Oh, you're there when I need you sometimes
Oh, oh
When I need you sometimes
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
And my worries become yesterday
'Cause, baby, know that I'm...

That junoesque, baby, I'm feeling love connection

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Have we met before? (Baby, 'cause I think I've seen you)

You've got that something
Were you in that movie with Scarlett Johansson? (Scarlett Johansson)

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Have we met before? (Baby, 'cause I think I've seen you)
In a movie, on the radio? (Not sure, but I want you)

[Outro: Rodney Jerkins]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
All my life I've kept my feelings deep inside
Never was a reason to let somebody know
"Lover here, lover there" - Who cried? Who cared? Foolish pride
"Never was a good seat at any of this man's shows"

[Chorus 1]
Until now all I wanted to do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

[Chorus 2]
But now I've got to let it go
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just let it go
Lay back and let my feelings show
I'm ready for the real
Give me something I can feel

[Verse 2]
All my life this heart's been under lock and key
My curtains were drawn, there wasn't nobody home
Trigger here, Trigger there - everybody's high except for me
Better off dead if I couldn't be alone

[Chorus 1]
Until now all I wanted to do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

[Chorus 2]
But now I've got to let it go
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just let it go
Lay back and let my feelings show
I'm ready for the real
Give me something I can feel

[Verse 3]
Fourteen years and tears, I've longed to sing my song
But a horse couldn't drag your ass to put me on
But now I've got an army and we're three million strong
This song will ring in your ears when we are gone

[Chorus 1]
Until now all I wanted to do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

[Chorus 2]
But now I've got to let it go
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just let it go
Lay back and let my feelings show
I'm ready for the real
Give me something I can feel

[Outro]
I am ready for the real (Come a little closer)

(let it go)
(Lay back an' let the vibe just flow)

[Verse 1]
I lost my tug of war today
Took my foot off of the brakes
(The definition of insanity is looping on repeat, and expecting things to change)
But what comes up must hit the ground
So I drink these anvils down
(She always comes to me highly disguised, an angel whispering, so many pretty shapes)

[Chorus]
It's a dance with the devil
A stumbling tango
It's a dance with the devil
Trying to borrow from tomorrow

[Drop]
It's a dance
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
It's a dance
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
It's a dance

[Verse 2]
Just want to connect
But you won't let me do it
So I get altered, (Twisted and conflicted, so I casually can shoot the shit)
Wish less was going on
Wish I could just throw the ball
And ignore it all
(Constantly distracted by the noise of my ping-pong)

[Chorus]
It's a dance with the devil
A mercurial wrestle
It's a dance with the devil
Trying to borrow from tomorrow

[Drop]
It's a dance
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
It's a dance
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
It's a...
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)

[Bridge]
But what, what is it worth
Waking up with a crown of clouds?
What is it worth
When my head spins out with doubt?
Wish I could measure
When the poison is pouring out
Oh...

[Outro]
It's a dance
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you (It's a dance)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you (It's a dance)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you (It's a dance)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
Oh, no, oh, no (It's a...)

[Verse 1]
I'm thirty-something going on thirteen
Still a sponge to everything
Saucer eyes wide, yeah, I still believe
And a sparkle in my steps
Smiling with my teeth

[Pre-Chorus]
They say that I might lose my Midas touch
They also say I may become irrelevant
But who the fuck are they anyway?
I don't care what they say

[Chorus]
I won't act my age
Time is just an invention man has made
No, I won't act my age
It's just my reflection that is out of date
'Cause it's all in your attitude
It's all in your point of view
I won't act my age
Just need a little bit of Peter Pan and some imagination
No, I won't act my age

[Verse 2]
So, I recommend that you lose your mind
It was the only thing that was keeping me behind

[Pre-Chorus]
They say curb your curiosity
They also say prepare to amend your dreams
But who the fuck are they anyway?
I don't care what they say

[Chorus]
'Cause I won't act my age
Time is just an invention man has made
No, I won't act my age
It's just my reflection that is out of date
'Cause it's all in your attitude
It's all in your point of view
I won't act my age (c'mon)
Just need a little bit of Peter Pan and some imagination
No, I won't act my age

[Bridge]
How old would you be? Yeah
How old would you really be
If you didn't know, yeah
How old you really were?
How old would you be? Yeah
How old would you really be
If you didn't know (Know)
How old you really were?
(Hey!)

[Chorus]
I won't act my age
Time is just an invention man has made
No, I won't act my age
It's just my reflection that is out of date
'Cause it's all in your attitude
It's all in your point of view
I won't act my age
Just need a little bit of Peter Pan and some imagination
No, I won't act my age

[Outro]
Oh-oh, I won't act my age
Ooh, yeah, ooh
Ooh, yeah, ooh
I won't act my age

[Verse 1]
Matthew, please do not regret
With your silk in my hand
And your heart in my sweat as you're
Lighting the end of my last cigarette
I will warm you, warm you

[Verse 2]
These things that lonely ones do
Baby, that's what I'm here for
I'll take care and make all your wishes come true
If you want to, do you want to?

[Chorus]
Don't take me for a fool
There's a woman inside of me
There's one inside of you, too

[Verse 3]
There is a meeting in my thighs
Where in thunder and lightning
Men are baptized in their anger and fighting
Their deceit and lies
I've got lips like sugar, lips like sugar

[Verse 4]
Holding my wrist to the bed
He was thrusting and moaning
And pressing his head to my temple
His head was a temple
I said you've got lips like sugar, daddy
Lips like sugar

[Chorus]
Don't take me for a fool
There's a woman inside of me
There's one inside of you, too
And she don't always do pretty things

[Verse: The Horrors]
I fell into the waves
They crash and they break
And I feel like my body turned
I lie flight over a giant crane
Heading through the surf
Figures on a ship
Rampant on a ship
How deep they are

[Hook: The Horrors]
How deep are your pockets and desires?
How evil is your heart?
I think I ruined the past
My god how long will it last?
These clouded feelings leave my body, myself

[Intro: Young Thug & Quavo]

[Chorus: Young Thug]

Pour a whole pint of the red and I can not drink it no more
She suck my dick til' I'm dead, I just be plankin' on hoes
Throw all my money in hunnids, call up the bank on these hoes
Red bottoms on a bad bitch
Don't shop nowhere but  at Saks Fifth
Walk around with the Draco
And they gon' shoot when I say so
Stack up the hunnids like Lego
I got some gangsters and there he go
Pulled up in a Wraith (skrrt)
Damn, you should have seen they face
Diamonds they blind 'em like mace
I just wanna fuck her then nut on her face
Damn, today been a hell of a day

[Chorus: Young Thug]

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
What the fuck these niggas doin'
More racks, drop a sack at the jeweler
Foreign ride, but your boyfriend a loser
Bust down Rollie, straight out the cooler
I fucked your bitch, make a movie
Model turned to a groupie
This lil' stripper got hit with the boot
And we came from the bottom, throwin' money out the roof
Rich nigga I done flooded my fingers
Bet they gon' hate when you make it
Trap still jumpin' like 2 3
Fuck the judge, ain't coppin' a plea
Play with the keys like Stevie
Trap or Die, now I'm livin' like Jeezy
Lamborghini and I'm whippin' it easy
Walk around pockets cheesy

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I'ma go hit him in the leg, have the nigga try to run
I done got a little richer, all a nigga pockets Big Pun
I just got a Richard Mille and the motherfucker one of one
I just got another bitch pregnant and my bitch say she leavin'
Now she stayin', now she goin'
What the fuck a nigga doin'?

And my mama say I'm good
But my bitch say that I'm ruined
Yeah, nigga fuck the police
Black and white house, Belly
Black bitch tall like Keesh

[Verse 1]
He followed me home again
And his eyes were watering
His eyes were watering like a child
I made-believe for him
That my blood was dripping
My blood was dripping into his mouth

[Chorus]
Screaming
Screaming

[Verse 2]
He cut off my oxygen
And my eyes were watering
As he tore into my skin like a lion
I knew it was poison
As he filled me to the brim
And my blood was dripping like a lamb

[Chorus]
Screaming
Screaming
Screaming

[Verse 3]
Leave your bedroom light on
I live to watch you undress
And you know that I'm there
As you soak in my stare with your right arm

[Outro]
Come to me
Come to me
Come, come to me

[Verse]
He brought her in to get out, to get out
He kissed her skin to get off, to get off, off
You can wake up now, momma
From your protective coma
When you wake up, you wake up

[Chorus]
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
Will you recognize the iris of the body?
Iris of the body?
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
Will you recognize the iris of the body?
Iris of the body?
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
Will you recognize the iris of the body?
Iris of the body?

[Outro]
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house
You won't recognize your house

[Verse 1]
Mercury, creeping on the sea
How she wails, flails her arms and weeps
Accumulation of debris
Lips apart, flapping as a lark
For in the dark there is release

[Chorus]
Every familiarity scarce as the great white shark

[Verse 2]
Oh, to build walls with golden gills
Spike in hand, high above the sand
To kill the sanctuary
Every mile that is owned
Only stands still by the grace of the stone

[Chorus]
Every familiarity scares as the great white shark

[Verse 3]
Look, daughter an owl
Listen to her howl
I howled when you were born through me
And you're alive with a breath you can't see
Oh, by the grace of this dream
So much coming in
I do not know where to begin
I just follow the lead you're pulling
And I get lost in your trail
So much more to tell
You just ask me if I'm doing well
But I do not know what the hell
I just swallow hard

In your eyes
Black diamonds
I could die
Black diamonds
In your eyes
Black diamonds
I could die
Black diamonds
And I wake up in a cold sweat on your ceiling
Terrified of what your love's revealing

So much you can see
Should I let you make a woman of me?
Should I let you take the mystery from me?
See the inside of my room at night?
Sometimes you will find
Things I do not know how to leave behind
I've been grappling with my mind
I've been stuck inside a jail
In your eyes
Black diamonds
I could die
Black diamonds
In your eyes
Black diamonds
I could die
Black diamonds
And I wake up in a cold sweat on your ceiling
Terrified of what your love's revealing

The cold of winter warms my blood and he's hot
Like a bed of steel
He finds his peace of mind
In the rivers and the whip-poor-wills
I could follow close behind
And slowly disappear
But I can never leave him
I can never leave him
I can never leave him
I can never leave him
I can never leave him
I can never leave him

In his eyes
Black diamonds
I could die
And I wake up in a cold sweat on your ceiling
So much more to do
Come on, let me make a man outta you
I could gather you and you tell the truth
You could cry inside my arms
You could cry inside my arms like a child
You could cry
You could cry

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Joba]
Hella boys say, hella boys say, hella boys
Hella boys say, hella boys say, hella boys

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann & Merlyn Wood]
I feel just like Zayn, I feel just like Harry
I cop it and I flip it, have it sittin' on pirellis
Me and all my niggas, Southside One Direction
Tens and tens and tens and tens, got lens that make direction
Flow to my location, lowkey I'm in Cali
Just avoiding my probation, fuck your jurisdiction
Fuck the Federales, sold out by my father
He gon' feel the karma when I get the, get the commas, nigga
I don't have, I don't have no fear, nigga
Buy the ounce, sellin' ounces over here, nigga
I don't lie, I just bought a whole grill
Arguing with my bitch, my whip sit twenty-six, nigga

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Lowkey I'm a heartthrob and I ain't drop an album yet
I'm something like a poster, sitting on your girl's wall
And something about my face make her take her clothes off
Y'all say y'all got bitches but y'all bitches make my dick soft
Why y'all always mad 'cause I'm feeling myself?
What the fuck you mean, I can't feel myself?
Old girl suburban but now I'm on to new things
Ego like celebrity but real like a dope fiend
Tanning out in Hollywood, got Chantel's on my coattails
From motels to hotels, I'm good, bitch, I'm good
From hotels to motels, I'm good, bitch, I'm good
From hotels to motels, I'm good, bitch, I'm good

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Joba]

[Bridge: Merlyn Wood]
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
In the city I'm a menace, I give CEO's the business
Marathons I gotta finish, foreign whip is speaking Yiddish
Lately, I been feeling vicious, why y'all crying like some infants?
You don't wanna be a witness?
Then you better mind your fucking business
All these crumbs on my denim, we the only dogs spitting venom
Been some years I tried to tell them
But they wanted me to be the villain
They just wanted me to lose, ones I loved would make me choose
Had to cut the ones I thought I'd take to the top
Just so I could make a move
Dropped out of college, smoking the same campus
Tell me 'bout limits
Last year I was suicidal, took those thoughts and tried to kill it
Used to avoid, used to being paranoid, huffin' with my boys
Pack it up, I shake the world like asteroids
Give me love before you try to give me noise, I destroy

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Joba]
Hella boys say, hella boys say, hella boys
Hella boys say, hella boys say, hella boys
Hella boys say, hella boys say, hella boys

[Outro: Merlyn Wood & Joba]
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me

They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me

[Verse: Ameer Vann]
I got some demons on me, they been feeding on me
When I sold prescriptions, and my pill addiction
Fuck the damn detectives, momma called the Reverend
I know she praying for me, but I'm in the shadows
Hella drugs and ammo, kicking doors, my MO
I got some bad habits, I do some shit I shouldn't
My life is on a scale, I know there's angels on me
All my dead homies, I know they waiting on me
Selling dope from out ya house, I know you praying for me
I know you used to trust me, I miss the chicken nuggets
And the kisses from her, damn I miss you momma (Shadow keep following me)

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Trouble keep following me
Trouble keep following me, oh yeah
The shadow keep following me
The shadow been following me, oh-wee, oh-wee, oh-wee
Trouble keep following me
Trouble keep following me, oh yeah
The shadow keep following me
The shadow been following me, oh-wee, oh-wee, oh-wee
Trouble keep following me

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
Nigga, talk shit, I'll single you out
If you've got a problem, we can figure it out
I'm from H-Town, but the gold in my mouth
Southside niggas put a hole in your house
A hole in your spouse
Better think twice 'fore you open your mouth
It's getting real close to the first of the month
Niggas hit licks, for the gas and the blunt
Send 'em to the doc, gotta open them up
Niggas load guns in the back of the truck
Niggas hate money 'til they laced with gold
Gotta get a gun for your hateful foes
Flex too hard and your casket close
You don't want your momma come
And get you from the morgue
Tall white T, blood on the floor
Oh, don't say that

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
Ohh-ohh-ohh, I feel like Master P
I ain't no slave, ain't lettin no one try to master me
I'm getting tested, tested, but nobody passing me
Ain't sugar coating shit, don't need them extra calories
It's a machine, that's why we work inside the factory
Put 'em up for me, display it, like it's a gallery
Don't need your salary, gold on me, like it's alchemy
Giving niggas the battery when they witness the mastery
Oh, don't say that, don't talk to me, we don't play that
They got chalk for me, I make outlines, like it's pottery
I got a squad full of fucking oddities
I got squash, apricots and broccoli
We turn weird shit to a commodity
I'm on a odyssey for real quality
It's like, oh

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
I look like a Somali pirate (Don't say that!)
Failed middle school and college (Don't say that!)
Daddy say I'm an asshole (Don't say that!)
Dick complexion of a Backwoods (Ew, don't say that)
She text me, dry as the Sahara (Aw-wah!)
After she get in that casa Merlyn (Straight up!)
I was in that mouth like flouride
That pussy tight as a hair tie (Ah! Ooh, ooh)
Scrunchie, I'm so horny, baby, bitch, your house, pussy, baby
When I get the munchies I steal, I don't share roaches, baby
Bum with the good haircut
Bum with a good haircut, mattress and magic dick

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, I know, you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit?
Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit?

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
See, I've been trippin' and fallin'
No more slippin' and stallin'
Got no numbers I'm callin'
Just wanna be in the coffin
All this trouble we've been causin'
Benz I'm crossin', I've been saucin'
Exercising my endorphins
Since you told me you were walkin'
I've been searchin', huntin', crawlin'
What's it costin' me? It ain't doing much
Tossin' me through a loop
I hush the voices in my head
For a minute so I can listen to you
And all I heard was
"I ain't listening", shit is cripplin'

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit?
Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit?

[Refrain: Kevin Abstract]
Niggas on that word of mouth 'til they see them boys come out
I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out
See me in your area, y'all niggas hilarious
I'm addicted to writing shit that make niggas scared of us
Niggas on that word of mouth 'til they see them boys come out
I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I got rubbers in my pocket, niggas like to gossip
If I need to drop 'em, let me know
'Cause I don't do much talkin' unless it's 'bout the money
If you got an offer, let me know
I was sellin' cabbage until I moved to Cali
Money in a mattress on the floor
Until I messed with niggas with fingers on the trigger
We was runnin', kickin' in the doors

[Refrain: Kevin Abstract]
Niggas on that word of mouth til' they see them boys come out
I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out
See me in your area, y'all niggas hilarious
I'm addicted to writing shit that make niggas scared of us

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
I use protection, my nigga, so fuck your lecture, my nigga
And fuck yo' section, my nigga, I got the rest of my niggas
My niggas rushed on my niggas, my niggas love all they niggas
I fell in love with that nigga, that nigga skipped out the picture

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Flap, flap, flap your wings, go high
Go high, go high
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride around the night
This little town, I wanna say goodbye
To everybody here 'cause they're all the same
I hate this place
And everybody here act all the same
Life's a disgrace

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
Flying on my rocket ship (Ay!), I'm on an acid trip (Ay!)
I need another pill, snort and let it drip
I'm with my white friends, we getting wasted
Trapped in the suburbs, we suffocatin' (Ay!)
We get all the drugs (Ay!) and education
"You came with Black folks?" Oh, your parents racist?
You say they hate me? Well, I love them
We still roll up, we still best friends (Ay!)

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Everybody smilin', I don't see what's funny
Everybody friends, guess I wasn't lucky
Family full of athletes, I was kind of chubby
Shit was never sunny, wrists were sorta bloody
Lick my wounds with honey, save me for the vultures
I'm fallin' in the void, I don't know what I discover
I know I could hear the thunder, I can feel the hunters
They be preying on my hunger, I won't let 'em make me suffer 'cause

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy

[Outro: Joba]
Oooh, take a moment
Do you take a moment?
Do you take a moment?
Oooh, take a moment
Do you take a moment?
Do you take a moment?

[Intro: Joba]
We failed at a one night stand
I guess that should not matter
You were loved by another man
I guess that should not matter

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
You love to show out
Show your new outfit
You love to show out
When you leave the house
Your new outfit
I love it on you though

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I love it on you though, I love it on ya
I love it on you though, I love it on ya
I love it on you though, I love it on ya
I love it on you, I love ya
I love it on you though, I love it on ya
(I love it on you) I love it on you, I love it on you
I love it on you, I love it on you, I love it

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood & Kevin Abstract]
I came to California
I cannot afford this
I just want a fortune
I don't wanna pay no mortgage
I just want life for my kids
Damn, I ain't even have 'em yet
I'm ballin', and it don't stop
And it don't stop
I can see my life through the window glass
If I move with you, I don't need no cash
Had a dream last night that she loved me back
Keep God in my head, so a nigga bounced back
Shit happened how it happened, so the past is perfect
Shit happened how it happened, so the past is perfect
Shit happened how it happened, so the past is perfect
Shit happened how it happened

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Fell in love, but it ain't gon' last
Hydroplane like I ain't gon' crash
No frame with my face on glass
No rank when they check my class
Got a minute, got a second, got a day
Gotta get it, gotta find another way
I ain't tripping, I'm just feeling what I say
I ain't talking, I'm just spilling from my brain
Everybody think I got it figured out
Chasing sanity while niggas chasing clout
Show me love in the face of all doubts
That would tell me all I need to know about you
Ain't nobody gon' love you like me
Ain't nobody gon' trust you like me
Baby girl, I know we can save the world
So why you wanna fight me?

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You love to show out
Show your new outfit
I love it on you, I love it on ya
I love it on you, I love it on ya
I love it on you, I love it

[Intro: Matt Champion]
Tuggin' on my pinky ring, smelling like chrysanthemum
I just want that, I just want that bump, bump in my trunk
Blowing skunk, getting crunk with my baby, oh, what's up?
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump in my trunk

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
We gon' ride, ride, ride down to Mexico
You can see the bad man, I'll come to New York
You can't catch him though
You can see the bad man, I'll come to New York
You can't catch him though
We gon' ride white lines all the way to Mexico
Merlyn, Merlyn!

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live (Ahh!)

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I've been trappin' out my momma house
Dope boy money keep the water and the lights on
Spray it, like it's Lysol
Your bitch don't like the dark so we fuckin' with the lights on
I fuck her with my chains on, you the one I changed on
I just won the ghetto lottery, I guess I'm hood-rich
Chillin' at the gallo, smokin' Blacks with my hood bitch
You ain't what you could be, come get on this dope dick
I sell it by the gram, now tell me who you fuck with

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live (Ahh!)

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me operate
I ain't here to talk now, nigga, we ain't gonna conversate
This modern terrorism, you can't moderate
I've been fiendin' time to put these demons on display
'Cause they don't understand, I don't give a damn
Smoke some shit straight outta Alice in Wonderland
BROCKHAMPTON the clan, bitch, I ain't your man
Like they're stacking just to crumble like an avalanche
This is how it stand, this is how it is
Bitch, I ain't your friend, I ain't havin' kids
'Cause I know that if I'm gon' bring him in the world
My little spawn of Satan just might take off with your fucking girl

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump, bump, bump
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump in my trunk
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump, bump, bump
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump in my trunk

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Rollin' in my truck (Uh-huh), gotta keep it tucked (Uh-huh)
'Cause whitey wanna fuck with some niggas like us
Confederate flag (Uh-huh), neighbors call me "fag" (Uh-huh)
Gotta keep it low, I keep that thang up in my bag

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood & Kevin Abstract]
Whose society is this? Who delayed my first kiss?
Who command my scholarship
And kick us out our neighborhood?
Play our music, make 'em rich, play our music, make amends
Box us in like plantains, free all of my Africans
There go that danger boy, danger boy!
Nigga, I slay, nigga, I waste them, them, waste them

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Oh-hoooo!
There go that danger boy, danger boy!
Oh-hoooo!

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
Niggas kill you for a dollar, listen to 'em holler
Big blood ballers with a crown on my corner
Crack and marijuana, slab around the corner
Sitting low on elbows, syrup on the dashboard

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
I got a dream I'm willing to die for
I got a team I'll commit a crime for
Got some dead homies I ain't get to cry for
'Cause I'm working for my freedom, while the world cry war
Cry wolf when the shepherd finds a way to strike gold
'Cause the stocks gon' crash and the dollar gon' fold
You don't know that the poor eat the rich when there's no profit
They gave you the floor but you brought up the wrong topic
So it's

[Outro: Joba]
Me against the world
Me against the world
Me against the world
Me against the world

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
I ain't the same nigga that I once was
I lost my fucking mind and then I fell in love
I did a bunch of drugs because I couldn't sleep
I lost a couple months, I chipped my fucking teeth
And there's a couple women and they know some things
About lies that I done told and shit that I done said
And niggas that I robbed, so I'm real paranoid
I have voices in my head

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Hi, my name is Merlyn, I just applied for food stamps
I just moved to California, with my boy band
Dropped out of a good school, hippies in my commune
I left 'fore the rent was due
Used to want a briefcase and a short commute
Used to wanna sell coke and whip an Audi coupe
Crazy, if I did that, wouldn't be talking to you
Walking through the pitfalls of a college student
Crazy how you get them letters and that make you feel accepted
'Til you walking 'round the campus and you the only African
Nobody with passion, just cats that take direction well
Take acid trips to find themselves, well...

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I gotta get better at being me (At being who I am)
I gotta get better at everything (At being who I am)
I just want a friend that I can hang out with (Being who I am)
Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with (Being who I am)

[Verse 3: Kevin Abstract]
Ever since I moved out, I've been broke
Ever since I grew up, I've been ugly
Ooh, I need get me some dollar, dollar, dollar bills y'all
Ever since I left my momma house
I've been mad as hell at the world
Sometimes you don't gotta rhyme when you feel it
Sometimes I barely ever feel a fucking thing
Sometimes I wish that my fucking phone would fucking ring
And go off, and wake a nigga up
I'm used to being sad and I'm used to being down
I'm used to being used, I miss my boy being around

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I gotta get better at being me (At being who I am)
I gotta get better at everything (At being who I am)
I just want a friend that I can hang out with (Being who I am)
Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with (Being who I am)

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
Dropping all I got on this one day
I just wanna be somebody someday
Dropping all I got on this one way
I just wanna be somebody someday
Dropping all I got on this one day
I just wanna be somebody someday
Dropping all I got on this one way
I just wanna be somebody someday

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I gotta get better at being me (At being who I am)
I gotta get better at everything (At being who I am)
I just want a friend that I can hang out with (Being who I am)
Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with (Being who I am)

[Outro: Dom McLennon]
I'm trying to look for motivation of smaller things
But baby steps to my atonement when I foster dreams
I've been told I'm too transparent with my thoughts sometimes
So I wrote songs until they pass and I can fall in line
I fell apart the moment that you thought you found yourself
'Cause I knew at that point, I couldn't be in the equation anymore
But moving on with open, broken hearts
Will show you everything you need to see about yourself to start moving forward
So many things I wanna say that I'm not sure need to be known
But everybody swears they fucking know me
So why, don't I lay every card I'm holding on the table?
At that point I wonder what they'd show me
I almost lost my father, still surreal for me to think about
Considering how many of my friends have lost theirs
I never know if what I'm saying is the right thing
If not, I'm ready more than ever for the crosshairs
It's all fair when it's not you
Some people have angels, what if only shadows follow you?
And all the ghosts inside that seem to hollow you
The branches of the weeping willow start to swallow you
And then you realize you're exactly where you're supposed to be
The horizon clears, you wipe the tears
And all the skeletons are ready for your story

[Verse: bearface]
Was I more than it's worth
Or will you see my name and I'll fade?
Pitch my camp in your mind
Sat by the fire behind your eyes
And I'll look through them just once or twice
But I might see something I don't like
Like your hands in his shirt
Entwined in cotton, his loving smirk

[Chorus: bearface & No Rome]
Losing my way, oh
Seeing your name, but I'll be fine, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
(No worries) Losing my way, oh
Did I come again dressed out like a shame? Cloudy
Seeing your name
Eyes are but a pain, roses in my veins, sorry
But I'll be fine, yeah (no worries)
Yeah-yeah-yeah (no worries)
Yeah-yeah-yeah (no worries)
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

[Outro: bearface]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Fearin' not growin' up
Keepin' me up at night
Am I doin' enough?
Feel like I'm wastin' time

[Pre-Chorus]
Promise to get a little
Better as I get older
And you're so patient
And sick of waitin'
Promise to do better
Shoulda coulda
Prolly wanna let me go
But you can't, oh
Right now I feel it pourin'
I need a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Right now I feel it pourin'
I need a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit

[Chorus]
Please don't take it, don't take it personal
Like I know you usually do
Please don't take it, don't take it personal
Like I know you usually do
Please, please
Don't take it personal
Don't take it personal
Darling, like I know you will, ooh

[Verse 2]
Forget to call your mama on the weekend
You should put yourself in time out
(Sh-sh-shame, Sh-sh-shame on you)
But lately you've been feelin' so good
I forget my future, never pull out
(SSh-sh-shame, Sh-sh-shame on me)
Baby the money'll make it easier for me
To run and hide out somewhere
(So far away)
Hoppin' through poppy fields
Dodgin' evil witches
These houses keep droppin' everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
Promise to get a little
Better as I get older
And you're so patient
And sick of waitin'
Promise to do better
Shoulda coulda
Prolly wanna let me go
But you can't, oh
Right now I feel it pourin'
I need a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
Right now it's really pourin'
I need a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit

[Chorus]
Please don't take it, don't take it personal
Like I know you usually do
Please don't take it, take it personal

[Outro]
Like winters fall on us, heavy
Take it off me, all it off
Winter, I can't stand this
Snow is falling all on me

[Verse 1]
You say you got a girl
Yeah, how you want me? How you want me when you got a girl?
The feelin' is reckless, of knowin' it's selfish
And knowin' I'm desperate
Gettin' all in your love, fallin' all over love, like
Do it 'til it hurts less
Hangin' out the back, all up in your lap
Like is you comin' home? Is you out with her?
I don't care, long as you're here by 10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, give me what I want

[Chorus]
My man is my man, is your man, heard it's her man too
My man is my man, is your man, heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend, oh-oh
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday, then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend

[Verse 2]
I gotta say, I'm in the mood for a little bit more of that
I mean, I'm sayin', what kind of tease is two days?
I need me at least 'bout four of them, more of them
More you on me, on us, just tell me you want me, yeah
Monday and I'll be at your door, ready to take her place
Ready to give you, what you've been missin' on weekdays
What you've been waitin' for, 10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, I know what you want

[Chorus]
My man is my man, is your man, heard it's her man too
My man is my man, is your man, heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday (Don't worry 'bout none)
Then just send him my way (Don't worry 'bout none)
Think I got it covered for the weekend

[Outro]
Ayyy
Bright ideas, we've got bright ideas
Ayyy (Ooh)
Bright ideas, we've got bright ideas
Ayyy (Ooh)
Bright ideas, we've got bright ideas

[Verse 1]
Need you for the old me, need you for my sanity
Need you to remind me where I come from
Can you remind me of my gravity?
Ground me when I'm tumblin', spiralin', plummetin' down to Earth
You keep me down to Earth
Call me on my bullshit
Lie to me and say my booty gettin' bigger even if it ain't
Love me even if it rain
Love me even if it pain you
I know I be difficult
You know I be difficult
You know it get difficult too

[Chorus]
Open your heart up
Hoping I'll never find out that you're anyone else
'Cause I love you just how you are
And hope you never find out who I really am
'Cause you'll never love me, you'll never love me
You'll never love me but, I believe you when you say it like that
Oh, do you mean it when you say it like that?
Oh, I believe you when you say it like that
You must really love me

[Verse 2]
For real, I'm not playing no games
Boy, we back and forth
I need your support now (now, now, now, now, now)
In case you call my phone one more 'gain
Got no panties on
I need your support now (now, now, now, now, now)
I know you'd rather be laid up with a big booty
Prolly hella positive 'cause she got a big booty (wow)
I know I'd rather be paid up
You know I'm sensitive about havin' no booty
Havin' nobody, only you, buddy
Can you hold me when nobody's around us?

[Chorus]
Open your heart up
Hoping I'll never find out that you're anyone else
'Cause I love you just how you are
And hope you never find out who I really am
'Cause you'll never love me, you'll never love me
You'll never love me but, I believe you when you say it like that
Oh, do you mean it when you say it like that?
Oh, I believe you when you say it like that
You must really love me

[Skit: Granny]
You don't have shit to say to me
I ain't got shit to say to you
Granny, and that's the truth
And step, and step on
Also you black heffa, yeah you, you stand your ground
'Cause I feel the same way
If you don't like me, you don't have to fool with me
You don't have to talk about me or treat me mean
I don't have to treat you mean
I just stay out of your way
That's the way you work that one

[Intro]
Maybe I should kill my inhibition
Maybe I'll be perfect in a new dimension

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I should pray a little harder
Or work a little smarter
This time baby promise I have learned my lesson ooh

[Chorus]
Down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
Do do do down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
I hope you will, I hope you will, I hope you will

[Verse]
Keepin' up is hard to do
Even harder feeling heavy, steady chasin' you
Beep beep, why are you lookin' around, you lonely?
I feel you comin' down like honey
Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I should pray a little harder
Or work a little smarter
This time baby promise I have learned my lesson ooh

Down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
Do do do down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
I hope you will, I hope you will, I hope you will

You love the way I pop my top
Or how I lose my cool
Or how I look at you
Say why?
It ain't no fighting, no I can't stop it
This took a while, yeah
Love the way I pump my fist or how I bust my hip
For your affection, tryna be down
No fighting and no stoppin'
Stick around

Wish I was the type of girl that you take over to mama
The type of girl, I know my daddy, he'd be proud of
Yeah, uh be proud of, yeah

Won't remember your name, I swear
Livin' so good, livin' so good, livin' so good
This time next year I'll be livin' so good
Won't remember no pain, I swear
Before that you figured out, that I was just a normal girl

[Outro]
Normal girl, what do you say now?
Quit on the world, 'cause it ain't going your way now
Quit on yourself 'cause you can't figure your way out
Normal girl
How do you be?

[Verse 1]
Baby, don't know why

While the crescent's crowning, the crescent's crowning

[Chorus]
Heartbreak on a full moon, oh

Girl, where did our love go?
Feels like strangers
Is playing on your loving so
Dangerous, ooh yeah
But it just hurts me to hear you say it
Under the moonlight
My heart is breaking, girl

[Chorus]
Heartbreak on a full moon
It's because of you, you baby, because of you, you baby, yeah, yeah

Heartbreak on a full moon
Heartbreak

[Verse 1]
Flight is a beautiful word
Flowered with consonance
That’s what I'll followed
Forever
I am a beautiful bird
Fluttered and floating
Swollen and hollowed
For heaven

[Chorus]
Do what you want with me
Lost in your captivity
Learning capacity
For make-believing everything
Is really hanging on

[Verse 2]
Slipping away from the party
Totally vacant
Everyone gone from their bodies
You were outside kissing another
She was a friend of mine
I was surprised to discover

[Chorus]
I wrapped my arms around her
She was a beautiful figure
There are no enemies
We’re make-believing everything
Is really hanging on

[Verse 3]
There is a castle that stands
High in the canyon
The blue knights are crying together
A child is holding my hand
She is directing, the red crystal pine with a feather

[Chorus]
Do what you want with me
Lost in your captivity
Learning capacity
For make-believing everything
Is really hanging on
Really hanging on
Really hanging on
Old volcanoes melting
Love is overwhelming
Letting your insides out

Blind altercation
Open invitation
Breaking your guard down

Leaving the familiar
Air is getting chillier
Stepping outside your skin

No ordinary measurement
You turn your own light on
You turn your own light on inside of me
Closer the farther you've gone
Stronger the harder you fall in front of me

Walking through your garden
Pulling up the garlic
Getting our hands dirty
Kissing on the vampires
Kissing on the werewolves
We have no enemies

No ordinary measurement
You turn your own light on
You turn your own light on inside of me
Closer the farther you've gone
Stronger the harder you fall in front of me
You turn your own light on
You turn your own light on inside of me
Closer the farther you've gone
Stronger the harder you fall in front of me
You turn your own light on
You turn your own light on
You turn your own light on inside of me
Closer the farther you've gone
Stronger the harder you fall in front of me

[Verse]
I remember Augusta, Georgia
Big trees and the lemonade
But I was born in the western portion
My life will never be the same

[Verse]
Made me think about Chi city
Toe steppin' in the ballroom
Made me think about New York
I had nothing to lose

[Hook]
Devil's off my shoulders
I've found the road to freedom
Whatever don't break me down
Can only make me stronger
If there was nothing to lose
Life wouldn't have a meaning
Whatever don't break it down
Can only make me stronger

[Verse: VerBS]

[?]
Started getting organized
And realized for real that this is more to rhymes
Instead of liking, I'm starting to love myself more
I'm drinking water and worrying about my health more
I did a lot of growing and nigga its kind of wise
Starving artist 

[?] like man personified
I'm an African and not an Afri-can't
And I know it's baffling but I got a master plan

[Hook]
Devil's off my shoulders
I've found the road to freedom
Whatever don't break me down
Can only make me stronger
If there was nothing to lose
Life wouldn't have a meaning
Whatever don't break me down
It only makes me stronger

[Verse]
Took a train to Kansas City
Black girls and the barbecue
The drove me to the church house
I swear I only tell the truth
Preacher man had a Rolla Royce
Preacher's wife had a white jacket
Everybody looking real broke
But the music wasn't bad

[Hook]
Devil's off my shoulders
I've found the road to freedom
Whatever don't break me down
Can only make me stronger
If there was nothing to lose
Life wouldn't have a meaning
Whatever don't break me down
It only makes me stronger

[Outro]

[?] Jesus I found love and it's alright, alright

[?] Jesus I found God and it's alright, alright
Lifting the edge of her bed
Walking a girl to the altar
No love is like this
No sacrifices
My only child, my only daughter
How will I leave your body?

Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms

I have the love of her father
He has the eyes of our daughter
Her eyes are like his
Shining sapphires
I see holy light
I trusted you to fight
Holy light, I trust in you to fight
How will I leave her body?
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Just like that, she is
I mean
We are, we are gone for good

For closing my eye
Too soon
Missed the room
Old magpie
It just passed me through

[Chorus]
Oh, when it gets you down
When you get that notion
Any way you walk around
Anywhere that you are going
If you ever wanna come back
You know my arms are always open

Just like how it used to be, Haley
Kicking around, burying letters we wrote
Oh, wondering what yours might've said to me
Mine went
There are the geese
Over the trail
We have the open road
Oh

[Chorus]
And oh when it gets you down
When you get that notion
Any way you walk around
Anywhere that you are going
If you ever wanna come back
You know my arms are always open

Just like that, he's holding my hand
Redirect, rearrange, bringing the moon to land
Oh

[Chorus]
And oh, and it gets you down
When you get that notion
Any way you walk around
Anywhere that you are going
If you ever wanna come back
You know my arms are always open

(Dougie on the beat)

[Chorus]
I fell in love with these streets, I seen a hundred thou
Started fuckin' bad bitches, I went runnin' wild (gone)
I just pray Papi forgive me, ain't seen my son a while (I pray)
I go and pick him up from school to see him fuckin' smile (facts)
Somebody save me, save me
Tryna please a bitch, it almost drove me crazy
I was breakin' bread with niggas that was shady
I said I would never change, but shit it changed me
Somebody save me, save me
Twenty-three and one, it almost drove me crazy
In a cell all alone, can't let it phase my
I just wanna make it home to see my baby

[Verse 1]
I fell in love with these streets, I seen a hundred thou
Bustin' choppers, sellin' dope, I went to runnin' wild
Threw a drum up in my forty, shoot a hundred times
Two hundred thou my cousin's case to see his daughter smile
Somebody save me, save me
All this lean and all these percs gon' drive me crazy
I see niggas switchin' sides like they KD
I can't let it kill my vibe 'cause I'm too wavy
This what I wanted, I'ma own it
Anything I ever said I'm standin' on it
Got my dog in the feds, he turned informant
I just pray that he don't say some shit to harm us

[Chorus]
I fell in love with these streets, I seen a hundred thou
Started fuckin' bad bitches, I went runnin' wild (gone)

Twenty-three and one, it almost drove me crazy
In a cell all alone, can't let it phase me
I just wanna make it home to see my baby

[Verse 2]
One time my dog tried to line me, must've lost his mind
When he know how we get down when niggas cross the line
And I hate to be the one that gotta call his mom
That money mix up with that greed, it happen all the time
If I can't trust you, it's fuck you
Know that money ain't a thang, I tell 'em touch you
Know them boys gon' bust your brain, I push a button
To make it home to see me son, know I'm gon' crush you
'Cause that's important, to keep it one hundred
I just wanna make it home to see my youngin (Papi)
Move my family out the ghetto all I wanted
Left me dancin' with the devil, chasin' this money
Amen

[Chorus]
I fell in love with these streets, I seen a hundred thou
Started fuckin' bad bitches, I went runnin' wild (gone)
I just pray Papi forgive me, ain't seen my son a while (I pray)
I go and pick him up from school to see him fuckin' smile (facts)
Somebody save me, save me
Tryna please a bitch, it almost drove me crazy

Somebody save me, save me
Twenty-three and one, it almost drove me crazy
In a cell all alone, can't let it phase me
I just wanna make it home to see my baby

[Verse 3]
And I'm so tired of makin' moves and gotta keep the tool
Gotta hide it from my son, I pick him up from school
With them papers with it, some would tell me I'm a fool
But all these hatin' niggas wanna see me on the news
And they debating on a nigga if I'm gon' win or lose
'Bout this paper I seen real niggas forget the rules
And I can't trust these bitches, I know they gon' pick and choose
No I can't trust these bitches, I know they gon' pick and choose
Amen

[Chorus]
I fell in love with these streets, I seen a hundred thou
Started fuckin' bad bitches, I went runnin' wild (gone)

I go and pick him up from school to see him fuckin' smile (facts)
Somebody save me, save me
Tryna please a bitch, it almost drove me crazy
I was breakin' bread with niggas that was shady
I said I would never change, but shit it changed me
Somebody save me, save me
Twenty-three and one, it almost drove me crazy
In a cell all alone, can't let it phase me
I just wanna make it home to see my baby

[The Notorious B.I.G]
What advice would I give to young rappers? Take control of your shit, don't -- don't be the type of rapper.. Don't be a stupid rapper.
A stupid rapper is a motherfucker that has somebody else tell them what to do -- which is not always wrong, but -- if it's something that you feel that you don't have to do, you really have to question it and find out why they want you to do it. Most niggas, they feel like, well, "you see what Biggie's doing! Y'know, he has the hat, the Kangol, and, and this, and you have to be like that!" But if you don't really wanna be like that, you don't have to be like that, you know what I'm saying? A lot of motherfuckers just try to tell a nigga to do something so quick, and -- and give them examples of other motherfuckers who did it and blew up and make them think they can do the same thing, which is not always necessarily true. And at the same time, you got to watch your money. It's so much funny shit in this game, man -- and they can play with your money, and you won't even know. I mean, as soon as I got in the game, I got a lawyer to watch my lawyer. That's just the way it's supposed to be played, you know what I'm saying? I speak to niggas -- I speak to niggas that got money in the game and they let me know, you know dog, it's a "dog eat dog'' world. Niggas is trying to get as much as they can. And if you a ignorant motherfucker, they gon' thrive off that. They can tell you anything. And I'm -- I never been stupid, so.. Especially with a whole big lump sum of money? I gotta keep by on that. So I just stay more in the business side of everything -- instead of being a nigga that's gonna be drunk at the bar and fuck all the bitches and.. and just, stay in hotels all day, and just trick a whole lot of money, I stay home with my wife and watch my money. It comes a lot easier that way. And.. you'll have a lot of money!

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
No limit in the sky that I won't fly for ya
No amount of tears in my eyes that I won't cry for ya, oh no
With every breath that I take
I want you to share that air with me
There's no promise that I won't keep
I'll climb a mountain, there's none too steep

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
When it comes to you, there's no crime
Let's take both of our souls and intertwine
When it comes to you, don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart when it comes to you

[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Want you to share that
When it comes to you

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Cupid ain't a lie, arrow got your name on it, oh, yeah
Don't miss out on a love and regret yourself on it, oh
Open up your mind, clear your head
Ain't gotta wake up to an empty bed
Share my life, it's yours to keep
Now that I give to you all of me, oh

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
When it comes to you, there's no crime
Let's take both of our souls, and intertwine
When it comes to you, don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart when it comes to you
Comes to you

[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Want you to share that (Share)
When it comes to you
Want you to share that

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
When it comes to you, there's no crime
Let's take both of our souls, and intertwine
When it comes to you, don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart when it comes to you
Comes to you

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Every dream in my head
It's like a mountain that I just keep climbing
And when I get to the edge
I turn around and put that dream behind me
And it never feels the way I want
But I keep on trying
I just keep on trying

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Have you been there?
Have you seen it all?
Have you done this once before?
Did they tell you, you'll love this life and all these lights?
Now you're lying on the floor
And they know, what doesn't kill you makes you want it more
And this is your life
Your life, your life

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]

Welcome to my—

[Verse 1: Cal Scruby]
Hello, this my life in your TV
I overdose on that nightlife, them bright lights and bikinis
I keep my hand on that gold bottle, I'm tryna find me that genie
They say money doesn't buy happiness, but I'd rather cry in that
Lamborghini
Damn, I don't know who I am
I just know who I wanna be
No lookin' back, everything is in front of me
I never act like they puttin' a gun to me
I ain't stuck up, same motherfucker that I've always been
You must got me fucked up, think I changed when I got that all white Benz?
Never that though
Been on my job, sayin' I'm different now
Say I don't listen now
I don't got time to pick up the phone to hear what you bitchin' 'bout
I'm on a mission, feel like I'm missin' now
Bitch, you ain't in my position now
You never walked a mile in my shoes
I'm feeling so distant now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Have you been there?
Have you seen it all?
Have you done this once before?
Did they tell you, you'll love this life and all these lights?
Now you're lying on the floor
And they know, what doesn't kill you makes you want it more
And this is your life
Your life, your life

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Welcome to my life—

[Verse 2: Cal Scruby]
I've been thinkin' too much (Much), I wonder if I did that right (Right)
I've been drinkin' too much (Much), I don't know what I did last night (Night)
Tried talk to myself like, "You don't really wanna live that life" (Life)
I wanted it all to myself like, you don't wanna give that life, away (Away)
But I gotta leave, I can't stay
Part of me say "Keep going," that other half say, "Quit playin'" (Playin')
Gotta keep prayin' (Prayin')
Even when I got it all, all these broads and alcohol
Livin' on the edge, I'm bound to fall (Fall)
But I stay movin', stay climbin' (Climbin')
Puttin' in work, I stay grindin' (Grindin')
Lookin' for the answer, can't find it (Find it)
That's the truth, I can't hide it (Hide it)
Now or never forever, that's how I'm livin' my life
It's hard to plan for tomorrow, when you just live for the night (Night)

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Every dream in my head
It's like a mountain that I just keep climbing
And when I get to the edge
I turn around and put that dream behind me
And it never feels the way I want
But I keep on trying
I just keep on trying

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Have you been there?
Have you seen it all?
Have you done this once before?
Did they tell you, you'll love this life and all these lights?
Now you're lying on the floor
And they know, what doesn't kill you makes you want it more
And this is your life
Your life, your life

Got me out here, beggin' on both knees
Mustard on the beat, ho

Girl, I ain't fuck you in a minute, remember lovin' in the shower?
Pussy, that's my dinner, fuck a kitchen
Round two, need a five-minute intermission
Round three, kama sutra, every sex position
I love when you make them faces
Too beautiful, you don't need no make-up (Make-up)
'Cause you a dime already
I need the type of bad bitch sleepin' by my side when I wake up

And all my diamonds shinin'

You try to hit me up when you need me
It was over 'cause I put my faith in you
Yeah, I'm hella cocky, I'm conceited, hella charged up
Bitch, I'm in my feelings for a fuckin' reason

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I ain't got to lie to you (No)
If you ain't in love then why do it?
Shattered my heart
Fuckin' bitches 'cause we fell apart

[Verse 1]
When we come through we fly as fuck though
I can mess with you but what for (hey)
If I play with you it'll be a draw
Match made in heaven, who's keeping score?
Everywhere, every door there's nowhere where we won't go
Every step, every blow we're always going to get goals
Relationship goals are you and me
Fighting H-A-T-E with L-O-V-E

[Pre-Hook]
Ride of your life, better bring your GoPro (bring your GoPro, man)
Don't need no pros 'cause we're gonna go slow (we don't need them hoes)
Love is the answer, what's the question? I don't know (no one knows)
Staring at the wall and I'm waiting for the call

[Hook]
(You said) Pick up your receiver, I'll make you a believer (call it)
Pick up your receiver (go ahead and call)
(You said) Pick up your receiver, I'll make you a believer
Pick up your receiver (leave yours on the ground I walk on)

[Verse 2]
It started when you asked me, "What are those?"
I looked at you and I was glad you don't know
I started walking by and it was special
That little dance you did was the best show
I drove to the store when my fuel's low (bang, bang)
I'm still heading somewhere and it feels raw
Baby, when we play it'll be a draw
A match made in heaven, who's keeping score? (kick out)

[Pre-Hook]
Ride of your life better bring your GoPro (you know though)
Don't need no pros 'cause we're gonna go slow

Staring at the wall and I'm waiting for the call

[Hook]
(You said) Pick up your receiver, I'll make you a believer (call it)
Pick up your receiver
(You said) Pick up your receiver, I'll make you a believer
Pick up your receiver (leave yours on the ground I walk on)

[Verse 3]
Would you, cry me a river, cry me a river (will you)
Would you let me flow or set me on fire
Gonna need you more like the ground I wear (liquid fire)
We can make a pair like breath and the air
Go to the top or be low
Tastes better than any combo
Xs and Os playing tic-tac-toe (tic-tac-toe)
We best friends, I guess so (guess so)

[Hook]
(You said) Pick up your receiver, I'll make you a believer
Pick up your receiver (bah, bah, bah, bah, bah)
(You said) Pick up your receiver, I'll make you a believer (come on)
Pick up your receiver (leave yours on the ground I walk on)
(You said) Pick up your receiver, I'll make you a believer
Pick up your receiver (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(You said) Pick up your receiver, I'll make you a believer
Pick up your receiver (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(You said) Pick up your receiver, I'll make you a believer
Pick up your receiver (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(You said) Pick up your receiver, I'll make you a believer
Pick up your receiver (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Okay I love you baby no matter what

I've been here for whatever I take

[Verse 1]
Ooh, the girl I love walked out on me
Leaving her love flowing strong
Oh, my heart would like to carry on
But she said her feeling for me was gone
I tried to find the words to say to make her stay

[Chorus]
But she said she couldn't stand it for another day
So the only thing that's left for me to say
Oh, change what you can
But when you can't leave it alone
Have the sense to know the difference between the two

[Verse 2]
I know the girl is on her way
Taking the love I need so bad
Oh, the love I guessed I'd never have
So what's the use of sitting around and feeling sad
I must respect the fact she won't be back my way

[Chorus]
Cause she said she couldn't stand it for another day
So the only thing that's left for me to say
Oh, change what you can
But when you can't leave it alone
Have the sense to know the difference between the two

[Bridge]
I sit around in misery
Over a love that don't belong to me
I did everything I could to make her stay

[Chorus]
But she said she couldn't stand it for another day
So the only thing that's left for me to say
Oh, change it, baby
Oh, change if you want to
You got to change, alright
Oh, change it, honey
Honey, you can change it

[Verse 1: Khalid]

[Chorus]
I was gone with the self of the day, gone
With the self of the day, gone
With the self of the day, gone
Gone, gone, gone
I was gone

[Verse 1]
I'm back, where are we going?
Seem to get tired of the morning dawn
With a basin on my head
I'm missin' all that I used to know, then
I get the kids to go
And I get up on with certain dread
And when I see the kissing down below
Easy life, I get right

[Chorus]
I was gone with the self of the day, gone
With the self of the day, gone
(Yeah, I get myself upright)
With the self of the day, gone
Gone, gone, gone
I was gone

[Verse 2]
I get dropped from where I belong
I take my pills and I get in the mode
And I take five to get it to load in
Even in the place
And I get my jeans on right
And sit in the rows and
Inside, I live in a cage and I
Peek out and summon the code
And I enter the lake to face what I'm cagin'

[Chorus]
Gone with the self of the day, gone
With the self of the day, gone
(Yeah, I get myself upright)
With the self of the day, gone
Gone, gone, gone
I was gone

[Bridge]
She gave me sleeping powder
I was gone
Gone, gone, gone

[Chorus]
(I was gone!)
I was gone with the self of the day, gone
With the self of the day, gone (Yeah, I get myself upright)
With the self of the day, gone
(I was gone)
Gone, gone, gone, gone
I was gone, gone, gone
I was gone

The yellow light shining down
The yellow light shining
1, 2, 1, 2
Everybody
Let's go!
Oh, hey!

[Verse 1]
Everyone's overdosing the blue light use
United States of anxiety continues
The brat is in his tower singing the flag burning blues
But we feel like the nuts 'cause we feel the screws
We don't care 'bout no fit
We don't care 'bout no trouble
We just wanna get in
Let's make out like we're lovers

[Pre-Chorus]
So much for taking it slow
Now everybody knows
Here we go!

[Chorus]
The yellow light shining down (Congratulations)
The yellow light shining down (Whoopi do)
The yellow light shining down (You control the world now)
The yellow light shining down (Look at you)
The yellow light shining down (I said 'Hey!')
The yellow light shining down (There's a higher power)
The yellow light shining down (Like a yellow light)
The yellow light shining down

[Verse 2]
When the stupid gets injected
The sunlight's the best disinfectant
Oh, just let the sun dry
It be like that sometimes
We don't care 'bout no fit
We don't care 'bout no trouble
We just wanna get in
Let's make out like we're lovers

[Pre-Chorus]
So much for taking it slow
Now everybody knows
Here we go!

[Chorus]
The yellow light shining down (Congratulations)
The yellow light shining down (Whoopi do)
The yellow light shining down (You control the world now)
The yellow light shining down (Look at you)

The yellow light shining down (There's a higher power)
The yellow light shining down (Like a yellow light)
The yellow light shining down

[Bridge]
Kill whatever you want
And undo what was done
But one thing you can't kill is the fun
(Fun, fun, fun, fun...)

[Chorus]
The yellow light shining down (Congratulations)
The yellow light shining down (Whoopi do)
The yellow light shining down (You control the world now)
The yellow light shining down (Look at you)
The yellow light shining down (I said 'Hey!')
The yellow light shining down (There's a higher power)
The yellow light shining down (Like a yellow light)
The yellow light shining down

So much for taking it slow
Now everybody knows
Here we go!

Here we go!

So much for taking it slow
Now everybody knows
Here we go!

[Verse 1: Trey Parker]
Hey! Why do you insist on trying to give me away
When they were too good and you wanted to shake them, who came?

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Parker & (Pharrell Williams)]
I was your dirty boy, your good, new secret toy
Show me how they get you joy (Who stayed in trouble with you?)
Oh, don't you want some more? Come on, I think they're gone
Our part is coming on (You're either with me or doomed)

[Chorus: Trey Parker & (Pharrell Williams)]
Hug me (Bring it in)
Would you loosen up? Would ya
Hug me (Bring it in)
I think they wanna take a picture

[Verse 2: Trey Parker]
Wake up, you're sleeping on me, playing this stupid game
Why can't we flex on the world and make them say our name

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Parker & (Pharrell Williams)]
Our favorite color's purple, we stay out past the curfew
My kung-fu grip will hurt you (Who stayed in trouble with you?)
You dyed your hair like me, black so everyone can see
Your parents couldn't believe (You're either with me or doomed)

[Chorus: Trey Parker & (Pharrell Williams)]
Hug me (Bring it in)
Would ya loosen up? Would ya
Hug me? (Bring it in)
I think they wanna take a picture

[Bridge: Trey Parker]
Oh would ya, would ya, would ya, would ya
Oh would ya, would ya, would ya
Oh would ya
Oh would ya, would ya loosen up, would ya
Oh would ya, would ya
Oh would ya, would ya
Oh would ya, would ya
Would ya wanna take a picture?

[Chorus: Trey Parker & (Pharrell Williams)]

[Chorus]
There's something special on the other side of this moment
And it's about what you and I decide
And it's important for you to remember we did this together
And finally, they'll know the story of our lives

[Verse 1]
I'm a sinner
Sometimes I only did what was required
I'm a sinner
Sometimes I sat down when I got tired
Should've stayed standing up
To do the job for which I was hired
But the good Lord
Thank you for relighting my fire

[Chorus]
Grab someone you love
There's something special on the other side of this moment
And it's about what you and I decide
And it's important for you to remember we did this together
And finally, they'll know the story of our lives

[Verse 2]
There's a brush fire
TV's watching it escalate
Smoke signals going up (read the signs)
It'll take your breath away
But they don't know how we act now
We'll turn our tomorrow into yesterday
Don't you nest away
C'mon, get dressed ok

[Chorus]
Grab someone you love
There's something special on the other side of this moment
And it's about what you and I decide
And it's important for you to remember we did this together
And finally, they'll know the story of our lives

[Bridge]
And if it happens to rain on my plans
Water and sweat will dry when they can
Not even cuffs will prevent this man
From the connection between these two hands
You heard me?
Yessir

[Chorus]
And it's important for you to remember we did this together
And finally, they'll know the story of our lives

[Intro]
One more time, I gotta tell you now
One more time, tell you

[Verse 1]
We've been down together for so long
Solid and strong
The lights went on
Wasn't your memory you forgot about
When you were down and out
You left dirt in my mouth

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you're probably saying "G"
I know you said it but woah, woah, woah
'Cause you really didn't believe
You didn't think that we would go, go, go

[Chorus]
Well, don't you know what they say about the show?
Well, even if you don't play, it must go on
You have decided to stay, you wanna be home
But don't take it no way, me and my bros
We just got to do it (do it)
Do it (do it) do it (do it) do it (he-ya)
One more time, we just got to do it (do it)
Do it (do it) do it (do it) do it (he-ya)
One more time, gotta tell you now

[Verse 2]
If I gotta do it alone, I will
Roll this boulder up this hill
Roll up my sleeves, no chill
Be rolling, you can sit still
More like family there were no bounds
We used to ride towns
And burn them all down

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you're probably saying "G"
I know you said it but woah, woah, woah
'Cause you really didn't believe
You didn't think that we would go, go, go

[Chorus]
Well, don't you know what they say about the show?
Well, even if you don't play, it must go on
You have decided to stay, you wanna be home
But don't take it no way, me and my bros
We just got to do it (do it)
Do it (do it) do it (do it) do it (he-ya)
One more time, we just got to do it (do it)
Do it (do it) do it (do it) do it (he-ya)

[Bridge]
Life must be a snowglobe
Distracted and confused
Gotta make yo' mind up
This is yours to lose
Things will always pop up
Like snowflakes they will move
And yes, that sounds real cold, but
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?

[Verse 3]
Can't tell what two dudes not allow
You don't like crowds
But you gotta get out
You could change the world if you change your route
You gotta leave your house
Go outside out

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you're probably saying "G"
I know you said it but woah, woah, woah
'Cause you really didn't believe
You didn't think that we would go, go, go

[Chorus]
Well, don't you know what they say about the show?
Well, even if you don't play, it must go on
You have decided to stay, you wanna be home
But don't take it no way, me and my bros
We just got to do it (do it)
Do it (do it) do it (do it) do it (he-ya)
One more time, we just got to do it (do it)
Do it (do it) do it (do it) do it (he-ya)
One more time, gotta tell you now

[Intro]
See I can tell you need to get away
Won't you stand there and shake your place
Look!
Let me see your energy
Let me see your energy
Let me see your energy (oh, come on now)
Let me see your energy (hey)

[Chorus]
Do your move, uh
Chuck through the wind, uh
And do it all again, uh
(Ooh) Come on now
(Ooh) A-come on now
(Ooh) Come on now
Do your move (hey)
Chuck through the wind, a-come on now
Do it all again (oh, oh)
(Ooh) Come on now
(Ooh) A-come on now
(Ooh) Hey, let's go

[Verse 1]
I remember when I was a boy
Used to watch the old folks catch the joy
Would laugh so hard that we had to leave
Ooh, I gotta a baby now to help me see
You can feel what they see
But little did I know that the energy
Is the same thing as the energy

[Pre-Chorus]
Some do not believe that you can
Feel the need within you but
We can prove it with the music
Move your body, let your body go
Some do not believe that you can
Feel the need within you but
We can prove it with the music
Everybody, let your body go

[Chorus]
I feel so good, a-come on now
Chuck through the wind, uh
Do it all again
(Ooh) Come on now
Do your move (hey)
Chuck through the wind
Do it all again, do it all again now
(Ooh) Make the girls say
(Ooh) Make the girls say
(Ooh) Make the girls say
(Ooh) Make the girls say
A-looka here

[Verse 2]
I remember when I was a boy
Used to think the old folks told us stories
I wouldn’t believe what I could not see
I woke up and I was on my knee
Can feel what they can see
The darkness told me that I could not leave
Light broke the shackles and now I'm free

[Pre-Chorus]
Some do not believe that you can
Feel the need within you but
We can prove it with the music
Move your body, let your body go
Some do not believe that you can
Feel the need within you but
We can prove it with the music
Everybody, let your body go

[Bridge]
One, two, three, now
Go go go
Go go go
Go go go
Go go go
Go go go
Go go go
Go go go
Go go go
Go go
One, two
One, two, three, four
Come on now
Come on now

[Verse 1]
If I lost it all today, what would you take?
Would my love be enough to stimulate?
Shit hit the fan, grenades got thrown
Would you still show, oh?
Could you go down with me to the mat?
Could we get back up beneath and eventually laugh?

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I gave myself a life
I gave myself a life
Oh, I gave myself a life

[Chorus]
We're all just looking for connection
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone to ride this ride with me
Can I get a witness? (witness)
Will you be my witness? (witness)
I'm just looking for a witness in all of this
Looking for a witness to get me through this

[Verse 2]
When you tell me everything, there's no holes
You can scroll through anything, you've got the codes
Nothing to hide, it's all in their eyes
And we just know, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I gave myself a life
I gave myself a life
Oh, I gave myself a life

[Chorus]
We're all just looking for connection
Yeah, we all want to be seen
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language
Someone to ride this ride with me
Can I get a witness? (witness)
Will you be my witness? (witness)
I'm just looking for a witness in all of this
Looking for a witness to get me through this

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Packin' all my things for the summer
Lyin' on my bed, it's a bummer
'Cause I didn't call when I got your number
But I liked you a lot
Slippin' on my dress in soft filters
Everybody said you're a killer
But I couldn't stop the way I was feelin'
The day your record dropped

[Chorus]
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang

[Verse 2]
Caught up in my dreams and forgettin'
I've been actin' like armageddon 'cause you
Held me in your arms just a little too tight
That's what I thought
Summer's meant for lovin' and leavin'
I was such a fool for believin' that you
Could change all the ways you've been livin'
But you just couldn't stop

[Chorus]
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang

[Bridge]
You're revvin' and revvin' and revvin' it up
And the sound, it was frightenin'
And you were gettin' a part of that
You're gonna hit me like lightnin'

[Chorus]
White Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Said, you're a wild mustang

[Outro]
You're gonna hit me like lightnin'
You're gonna hit me like lightnin'
(Thank you everybody)

[Intro]
I'll sing myself to sleep
A song from the darkest hour
Secrets I can't keep
Inside of the day
So sit down
Oh sit down, oh sit down
Sit down next to me
Sit down, down, down, down, down
In sympathy
Oh sit down, oh sit down, oh sit down
Sit down next to me
Sit down, down, down, down, down

[Verse 1]
When you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so tired but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

[Verse 2]
When the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Verse 3]
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try you'll never know
Just what you're worth

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Bridge]
Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I...
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I...

[Chorus]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Intro: Future & DJ Khaled]
Hide the money and ran outta room, yeah
I tried to hide the money and ran outta room
I tried to hide the money and ran outta room
I tried to hide the money and ran outta room
DJ Khaled!

[Chorus: Future]
Money on your head, you might get hit up today
You can't be wonderin' why they always stayin' dead broke
In the kitchen cookin' chickens like a redbone
My grandma seen me buy my first Polo sweater
I, got my hand flooded, I, bought the whole projects
I, got my hood stuntin', this whatever
I, charged the whole 30, I, got my niggas workin'
I, got my bitches down for whatever
(I tried to hide the money and ran outta room) Whatever!
(I tried to hide the money and ran outta room) Whatever!

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
(Geek!)
Pay up like I've been runnin' it up forever
I ran that shit up through the roof
Young nigga ran that shit up for his mother
Buy her everything and I got proof
Up, designer fit, ain't known to buy it (facts)
And I done whipped every tire
With the brake pad, "Mello Yello", catch up
Ring me up like your pop-pop, whatever you need to
I skeet then skeet off in a new coupe, keep up!
That V-12 'bout to heat up, grab your seatbelt, your seatbelt
The color of my boxers, yeah I'm Tommy'd up
Got the Tommy tucked, ayy
I, toss that shit up like a spray, watch it spill on the clothes
I, soak that shit up when they told me "Don't matter, boss won"
I, suspended these bitches and I subpoenaed these niggas
To see who was real
I, supported my bank account and I wouldn't tell you the account

[Chorus: Future]
Money on your head, you might get hit up today
You can't be wonderin' why they always stayin' dead broke
In the kitchen cookin' chickens like a redbone
My grandma seen me buy my first Polo sweater
I, got my hand flooded, I, bought the whole projects
I, got my hood stuntin', this whatever
I, charged the whole 30, I, got my niggas workin'
I, got my bitches down for whatever
(I tried to hide the money and ran outta room) Whatever!
(I tried to hide the money and ran outta room) Whatever!

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
M-M-Maybach Music
DIamonds all on my fingers, misses still miscellaneous
Left the ski-mask in the 'Rari, residencies out in Vegas
Smoking like Calvin Broadus, blueberry with the big homie
Idols becoming rivals, down to die for my survival
Fell in love with the money, she at the spot every Sunday
Loyalty's what I lust, how I measure my woman
Minimize my mistakes, love every tat on my face
DJ Khaled my blood, got several M's in my safe (Huh)
M-M-M

[Chorus: Future]
Money on your head, you might get hit up today
You can't be wonderin' why they always stayin' dead broke
In the kitchen cookin' chickens like a redbone
My grandma seen me buy my first Polo sweater

I, got my hood stuntin', this whatever
I, charged the whole 30, I, got my niggas workin'
I, got my bitches down for whatever

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz
Watch me break down bales, residue on scales
Yeah, I had the girls sick, man I cure like nails
Competition might fail, repetition might sell
Dirty kitchen, dirty dishes, dirty bitches, oh well
Foreign whip rider, lobster on my rider, uh
You can get the platter, uh, I put my money up (Up)
You gon' need a ladder (ladder), work, no acrobatics
Work, no calisthenics, my dick be acting stingy
My check be acting boujee, my car got all the groupies
I bought a new Rolex now my old Rolex tryna sue me (Yeah)
Fashion on exotic (exotic), pistol on regardless (Regardless)
Bitches look like Barbie, Ricky Bobby on my trolly (Yahh)

[Bridge: Future]
Tryna set a bando on fire
I'm just tryna get you so higher
Money coming in, we get flyer
You must be tryna wife her like Tiger

[Chorus: Future]
Money on your head, you might get hit up today
You can't be wonderin' why they always stayin' dead broke
In the kitchen cookin' chickens like a redbone
My grandma seen me buy my first Polo sweater

[Verse 1: Nas]
I'm principle driven, only real ones feel me
Most needed protection from the OG's to get bigger
No disrespect to them, but I never needed them older niggas
Or so we thought speedin' through life like
The speed of sound – what your life like?
Momma stressin', seen the ratchets in the dresser
She not askin' questions
Seen the vests, seen other kids in the caskets restin'
Life ill, 'cause most of my niggas in jail
For them it was hustle or death, I reshuffled my deck
I gave myself a good hand
Probably ran through a hundred million
Per decade, I'm not phased, and I could spot ya
A hundred million before you could ever spot grays
Chili Fritos in the helicopter
Money can't get that ghetto out'cha

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
150, stack it all in my Gucci jacket
50 more in the Goyard, it's secured
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
It's secured, it's secured

Got the mansion on the island

It's secured, it's secured
100 mil', keep on pilin'

Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
It's secured, it's secured
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
It's secured, it's secured
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

[Verse 2: Nas]
Watch out for insecure niggas
They take your soul out your body, they not secure
I pray the Lord stop a opp before I go backwards
Resort to violent reactions
That's childish, my life's a dream to rappers
Afraid they moments have past 'em
It's all different hustles (Straight up!)
Niggas movin' bricks
Young niggas rappin', doin' shows, hittin' they licks
Everybody holdin' shmoney in pics
Don't get robbed, boy, is you dumb?
All them swipers gettin' it how it come (Yep!)
43, morally ambiguous, you serious?
Gettin' it, lyricist, idiots, you ain't nearin' this
Out of New York's biggest and richest
I'm the template, low-key the busiest
The game chose me, deal with it
So I'm the quiet type, Mr. One Mic
But silently listen, use the same letters to spell it right
So hear me, from Nasty I'm mature
Here's another appetizer
Khaled, we did it again, let Travis take us higher!

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
150, stack it all in my Gucci jacket
50 more in the Goyard, it's secured
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

Ayy, DJ Khaled, I'd die for you, my nigga
So you already know I'd kill for you, boss (Maybach Music)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Diamonds drippin' on me, she know who the one
Two-seaters every season and I just begun
Aquafina, she drippin' puddles on a sunny day
Multi-million dollar plays and that's a hundred ways
Fuck a fashion, we could match in my Hermès seats
Top down, JFK, I pray he get impeached
Say no names, Supreme underwear and like 80 chains
Hundred for the rich forever perspective, never change
Petty bitches postin' niggas like they was wedding pictures
Evidently, I'm gettin' richer, trickin' seven figures
Ain't no difference when you see me or that's on television
Chasin' a hundred million, baby, my natural ambition, boss

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
All my life, that's on everything, yeah
This forever, I put that on everything, yeah

I just copped a mansion for my son on everything, yeah

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Boy, I took my life and bossed it up
I took the risk, coin-tossed it up
I just left work to work some more, I'm still a workaholic
I done sacrificed it all, paid the dues and costs
Life will test us all, let's see if we true or false
I walk up to my fate and stare that shit in the face
Hungry for the competition, bitch, get on my plate
No mercy, no grace, I'm checkin' off my to-do list
There's no room off in the schedule
It's only room for improvement
And I realized all I ever needed was in me, nigga
S on my chest, boy, so shots can't even pinch me, nigga
No substitute for me, but they gon' still tempt me, nigga
God is in me, that's the only one who can end me, nigga
And we seen more blessings than a Baptist Ebenezer
My daddy says, "You got a good girl, she's a keeper"
Boy, I'm a Caesar, I see shit and seize it
Roc-A-Fella chain, but you can still get Ether'd
Yeah, they don't really fuckin' feel me
Man, but when you really run it they try and clip your Achilles'
I'm on track to a billi', I got Khaled fuckin' with me
That mean I got the Holy Key and got the key to the city, lil nigga

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
All my life, that's on everything, yeah
This forever, I put that on everything, yeah
If I ever, I move onto better things
I just copped a mansion for my son on everything, yeah
All my life, that's on everything, yeah
This forever, I put that on everything, yeah
'Cause if I ever, I move onto better things
That's on my life, yeah yeah
Yeah, I just pull up in my everything, yeah

Young Money, Alicia Keys, kyuh!

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I just got back from
Where they said I couldn't get back from
And I thank God, I thank God that I made it
They surprised, they surprised that I made it
Heart is like diamonds, keep blindin' their faces
I wonder how I keep finding these places
I can't explain how it feels to be patient
Killing the drama, we finally made it, hey-yeah

[Post-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows, nobody but you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows, nobody but you

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I got something inside of me that can't be quenched
I'm addicted to winning and I can't be benched
Go to war for every black queen that they lynched
And my pockets on chubby but they can't be pinched
Uhh, after they use you, then they abuse you
Then they get mad when they lose you (excuse you)
You know the liar will accuse you
You know the queen still reign, it's just business as usual
Anything I touch, I bless it, track record so impressive
Opened the Billboard Awards with a hit record
The devil thought he had me
But I rebuked him, got money and I'm still a baddie

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I just got back from
Where they said I couldn't get back from
And I thank God, I thank God that I made it
They surprised, they surprised that I made it
Heart is like diamonds, keep blinding they faces
I wonder how I keep finding these places
I can explain how it feels to be patient
Killing the drama, we finally made it, hey-yeah

[Post-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows, nobody but you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nobody knows, nobody knows
Nobody knows, nobody but you

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
Say nobody knows
All the trouble I've seen (tell 'em baby)
Glory, looking for some glory
From all the trouble I've seen (one more time)
Tell em' nobody knows, all my sorrows
Nobody knows what tomorrow

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I just got back from
Where they said I couldn't get back from
And I thank God, I thank God that I made it
They surprised, they surprised that I made it
Heart is like diamonds, keep blinding they faces
I wonder how I keep finding these places
I can explain how it feels to be patient
Killing the drama, we finally made it, hey-yeah

[Post-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: Alicia Keys]
Baby, say it glory
You, I
Can you feel it? Can you see it?
Tell your mama you

[Intro: Pusha T & DJ Khaled]
Yeah
We the Best Music!
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Please, Khaled, don't pair me or compare me
Unless the said party is a rare breed
The stories I hear, they tend to mirror me
At this point now, rap is only therapy
President Push—I'm more Eric B. 
I ain't no joke—check out my melody
Felony, felony, felony, that's all they selling me
But two million in large bills is billing me
I was on the wrong side of the law
Like Pac was on the wrong side of the car
Like B.I.G. at the Soul Train Awards
The moral is all greats been driven
G-Wagons are bulletproof
The ones before me got snatched like bullet tooth
Tony nigga, only one left from the drug era
The jewelry weighs more in the drug mirror

[Interlude: Pusha T]
Yeah, what you see when you look in the mirror, nigga? Haha
Yeah, I know who the fuck I am

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Yuugh, tell me how you fit in
Was you a street nigga when Nas said It's Written
When Reasonable Doubt dropped, how was you living?
I was leading up the grinding in my kitchen
Getting work from Detroit like a piston
We was on a mission, stuff it in a Michelin
I could spend a year reminiscing
The length of your career, reminiscing
We can't occupy the same space
We ain't even running the same race
When it come to these bitches, it ain't the same chase
Moynat vs Céline, we ain't the same taste
Therefore, it's no comparison
To be mentioned with you niggas is embarrassing
I am one Joe Blow, you know my narrative
Clear your sinus like Claritin
Push

[Interlude: Jadakiss]
When you look in the mirror, what do you see, nigga?
'Cause I know when I look in the mirror, I know what I see
You peasants don't deserve my presence

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
You portraying other individuals
Me, I'm just weighing my residuals
From where success is the bare minimal
You a rapper, I'm a criminal
I had money before they found y'all
That's why I feel funny around y'all
Lord, bless those praying for my downfall
If I get too deep, don't let me drown, y'all
Hearing 'em talking 'bout how to flip a key
Started moving that Daddy Kane and Nicky D
Had the whole YPD sick of me
Don't sit, if you get tired, just pick a knee
Bet it all or bet it large
Now the coke, all these pills, and the crack, all these credit cards
I just laughed and I shrug at it
'Cause the niggas with the money are the drug addicts
Kiss

[Intro: Sizzla]
Never let me down
For the kings have decreed (bless thy soul)
Righteousness shall be
Show us thy love, oh
Have mercy upon thy soul
Never let me down, no man
Happened today like nothing
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Sizzla]
I wanna say thank you for the time and the love that you share
All the help and the effort just to get me there
When everyone turned their back you showed me how muched you care
You believed in me, never forget you I swear
I'll always be strong, my character defines me
I will never be that hateful and throw stones behind me
Temptation and ego can get you so wrong
A lot of people easily forget where they're comin' from

[Chorus: Sizzla]
I'm so grateful for all you've done to bless your soul
With the riches of love forever
Happiness shine as a burning sun
It's a blooming blessing, hey
Let it flow, it's a pleasure

[Verse 2: Sizzla]
Hours upon hours searching for a better way out
And the evil and ignorant people sending the choppers
Still just gotta look out
Jah is my guide, I know I'm here for a reason
Put my trust in the Most High
And my prayers are so consistent, ah
Who would've thought it would be like this today?
Nothing but prayers lift up your head
Lion in the jungle, I tell ya
He who have been blessed...

[Interlude: DJ Khaled & Sizzla]
Welcome to Grateful
Strength is strength, strength is strength
You realize and appreciate your blessings
Embrace your blessings from the heart
To express your gratitude by doing righteous deeds
Asahd, my son - I love you
Thank you God
I also want to thank all my enemies, for turning they backs on me
Thank you, I'm so...

[Chorus: Sizzla & DJ Khaled]
I'm so grateful for all you've done to bless your soul
With the riches of love forever
Happiness shine as a burning sun
It's a blooming blessing, hey
Let it flow, it's a pleasure
Hours upon hours, searching for a better way out
DJ Khaled!
I'm so grateful for all you've done to bless your soul
With the riches of love forever
Happiness shine as a burning sun
It's a blooming blessing, hey
Let it flow, it's a pleasure
Hours upon hours, searching for a better way out

Young money nigga no PG, slow it down for me like juvie

The Patek Phillipe sit right on my wrist
With a super bad bitch eatin' right at Phillipe
Know she fuckin' with a winner
Jewelry lookin' like a slushie fresh up out the blender
Maybe I hit her, maybe I didn't
Even if I did, I don't remember
Been a player since the very beginning
Stones in my charm, never my denim, no
Chain flooded like the levee broke, huh, incredible
Rappin', it was either that or sellin' dope, shit, let the dice roll
Now diamonds all on top of diamonds, huh?
Drippin', let you know I gotta go
I catch you anywhere, you get strong-armed
I'm talkin' upstream on a paddle boat
Okay one car, two shoes
You in hot water like a pack of noodles
Yeah, wife-beater, no tattoos

[Verse 1]
I never came to the beach, or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore, under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu

[Verse 2]
We watched the sun go down as we were walking
I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu

[Post-Chorus]
In Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu

[Outro]
We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
And you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start
A dream come true in Malibu

[Verse 1: Future]
A million dollar cash on me in the studio when I did this verse
My money is longer, my weed is stronger
All my bitches is badder, these niggas is sadder
My rubies got chalice so fuck all the chatter
Tissued the money, I rest on them plaques
King of the Patek, clarity showing without even knowing
Jump out that Lambo with the red bottoms on
The capital going up heavy in Florence
Duffel of Franks just to boost my endurance
Two number ones in a row

Yo, yo

Who lied and said you next? Crying emojis in my group texts
Stay in your bum-ass duplex, it's Minaj, no group sex
Queen never shuffle, you deal
Just turned down a four-million-dollar shoe deal
Keep your man off my Instagram, bitch
99 problems but ain't one a damn bitch
G4-fly even when I land, bitch
Lookin' like Pocahontas, yeah, they want my land, bitch
I'm just exotic, bitch, chronic bitch
Shoe game on psychotic, bitch
Yes, I am iconic, bitch
P-Pussy get 'em hooked like phonics, sis
Every ball player tryna find this bitch
Ball hard but I'm too fine to fine this bitch

Full throttle switch
Pick a side, pick a side, they gotta switch
Big MAC billboard out in Times Square

I got my car back, I'm John Wick
The sky blue tint come equipped with the convicts
The don's slick, some Billys we gon' get
Broke a leg in my debut, no Bogut (Crack get 'em, uh)
Talkin' sports trades with Pecas
While sides cheat on their husbands, those be the best vibes
Satin grain on the hood of the car
Switch lanes, yeah I used to flood the hood with them jars
You can get a taste for a flat out key
'Cause now-a-days I'm Klay, see my spot up 3
Draped in Hermes scarves, crusing the Riviera
More solid than gold bars, the Billy era

[Chorus: Fat Joe]

Hustlin' on the corners, now we own the stores
Fuck a million dollars, boy, I need a billi' for sure

Back of the bag's all crunched out, we vexed too
Should've been Billys in '92, line who? The shine's new
Yeah it's sorta like a mafia movie
Sit back, Rocky and Groovie with the '9-2
Silk pieces in Velez's sneakers
A duffle bag with handcuffs on it, we creatures
Ayo, runnin' every strip club, lit love
Yeah we sit around and just drip bub', the homies get piff love
To all the realest ones and rich thugs
One, my hundred niggas, Billy, we gun on niggas

[Chorus: Fat Joe]

Fuck a million dollars, boy, I need a billi' for sure

Serving coke, dog food and kush, I call it a triathlon
In a red Dawn with an Amazon
She pissed me off, I just found out she got her panties on
A year ago seen niggas get stabbed over honey buns
It may sound funny to you, found out he got punctured lungs
I just want the funds, I don't rap for fun (Nope)
I rarely post the money, I never pose with guns (Shh)
Went from a robber to the upper upper echelon
Just to get here I had to rob a couple Mexicans
But free Kodak Black, bring Lil' Kodak back (Kodak)
Cause they don't wanna see you move into their cul-de-sac
It's Gucci

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I'ma go get that Wraith

[Verse 1: Future]
Fucked the DA on my way here
I made some millions on my way here nigga
I seen your comment on my way here
I laughed my ass off on my way here nigga
Bentayga with the brain bust open
That new Mulsanne got the brain bust open
Play them racks like Jimi Hendrix on the guitar
Load my gun, cock it back and then I push start
I can't name how many times they tried to clone me
I can't name all the names that tried to clone me
This dirty money help me see the devil
Sidity thots, know they ain't forever
My trials and tribulations playing out on blogs
Spend three hundred thousand or better, that's on all the cars
The Maybach park itself, nigga
That Range Rover came with steps, nigga
Electric tables in the back, I'm eating filet mignon
He been 44'n all year, I put that Rollie on
Trapping good all year, put the Rollie on
They parading in the streets, you gotta keep a drum
Say a prayer for my young nigga, know he dumb
The murder rate going up nigga
I done ran this check up nigga
Get hit up from the neck up nigga, yeah
The Goyard looking like a graveyard
Murder money, I'm in love with murder money
Old friends of me turned into my enemy
My money and fame changes niggas into enemies
All my hard work and lonely nights no sympathy
Want to send a hit but too far in the industry
I feel your energy, I know you niggas envy me
They rep the gang that bangin' it out in penitentiary
I watch the shit come out your mouth and it's finicky
I'm tryna love you but I doubt I'll scream infinity
With these billions on my mind, it's hard to be cohesive
Gettin' that A-Rod money like I hit the needle
Keep a spanish mamacita like a Fanta liter
And I gave 'em all dope and they pissed off
Got my lil Haiti babies waiting so they can wack ya
I got my Memphis Ten niggas waiting to jack ya
I got some DC niggas waiting to kidnap ya (chyea, chyea, woo)
I got the clappers, finessers and the trappers (chyea)
Before the rap change, you gotta go dap em (chyea, chyea)
Don't forget to look at niggas when they after ya (chyea)

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I told Future I can see the future
Told my bitch I love you 'fore I knew you
I know I'm blessed nigga, hallelujah (I'm grateful)
And if you diss me then I might shoot ya (brrrrt)
You don't fuck with me, the feeling mutual (fuck you)
Half these rap niggas owe they jeweler (fuck 'em)
I was selling keys to success
I was coppin' keys outta Texas
New Wraith with the stars in it
New Porsche, condo, living room cars in it
Ace of Spades with the Percocet and bars in it
Young shooters, real soldiers put they heart in it
Let's talk 'bout all this money we make and all these niggas they hatin'
Let's talk 'bout runnin' that bag up fast cause we ain't got no patience
Let's talk 'bout poppin' 'scripts and Xans like we're patients
And them fed's allegations will have you pacin'
Million dollar dope boy, I gotta be grateful (grateful)
You tryna get that 100 mil', I'ma race you (race you)
Dope boy, I ain't never wanna be a rap nigga (huh?)
Billboard reporter LA Reid just signed a trap nigga
New York Times read Jay Z just signed a trap nigga (facts)
Kitchen like it's Thursday, you heard? Might bring it back nigga (facts)
You fuckin' the money up if I'm being honest (honest)
Gotta be grateful, I never break the promise (promise), I know my plug love me (love me)
I know my bitch hate me, I heard my hood salty
I tried to tell 'em it ain't my fault, it's just my blessings called me (yuh)
But since they hatin' on an nigga I'ma keep ballin' (yuh)
And I ain't textin' that bitch back because she keep stallin' (haa)
If she ain't fuckin first night then she just miss her callin'
Fuck a plea, I'm goin' to trial, poker face, I'm all in
Patek Philippe, AP, 40 mil', I’m all in
Plug hit my line I act like I ain't see 'em callin'
I worked so hard for mine I'm tryna get some free bands
I'm the king of the city, my house Graceland (I am)
No respect for rappers, they respect the coke man (for real)
That's why your favorite rapper actin' like the dope man nigga

[Chorus]
But what's it gonna take for a guy like me to find a girl like you?
What I gotta do to find a girl whose loving is more than true?
No one can play the game alone, even if you try to
Baby, I'm yours now
Dreaming a connection
I can meet you downtown
I'll take you where you wanna be tonight

[Verse]
Too much looking around
I can see how this happens
Using up all the lifelines
Tryna turn out decent
You've got plenty of time
I can see you walked over
What you see isn't in my mind
Don't believe we've met before
I'm acting, playing quiet, smiling, without thought
'Cause my world's been turned inside out
Been gone quite a while

[Chorus]
But what's it gonna take for a guy like me to find a girl like you?
What I gotta do to find a girl whose loving is more than true?
No one can play the game alone, even if you try to
Baby, I'm yours now
Dreaming a connection
I can meet you downtown
I'll take you where you wanna be tonight

[Bridge]
Aren't you gonna stay?
Keep me 'til the sun comes up
Crack a Pellegrino
From the bottle, no cup
That was summer love, that was summer love
Late night, cemetery
Think it's still light out
Temporary love at sight now
Love is scary, baby, look out

[Chorus]
But what's it gonna take for a guy like me to find a girl like you?
What I gotta do to find a girl whose loving is more than true?
No one can play the game alone, even if you try to
Baby, I'm yours now
Dreaming a connection
I can meet you downtown
I'll take you where you wanna be tonight

[Verse]
I try and be the man my pops see in me
Drivin' down this road they call Easy Street
Waitin' for the light to turn green
And life is all good when they sights is on me
Tonight they call me money-driven Mac
'Cause once I see them dollars, I ain't gon' give 'em back
At the edge of your seat, you need to just relax
This ain't the main course, I'm just givin' you a snack
But soon you'll be ready for a meal
But I ain't ready, so y'all can just chill
'Cause I know that I ain't ready for a deal yet
I ain't even get a chance to play the field yet
Just started, I need to break a real sweat
But I haven't spit somethin' they ain't feel yet
Well, hold up, everybody got some haters
They hatin' on the Steelers and in love with the Raiders
Angry at the top from the bottom
Try and pull ya leg, hopin' that you'll fall and break
But I ain't makin' that mistake
I had to do this beat when I heard my man Drake
For goodness sake, this shit just sets me in a trance
Some people wanna listen, and the rest just dance
That's cool with me 'cause I like to get my groove on
I'm comin' with some new songs, tryin' not to do wrong
But lately it's been kinda hard
'Cause money on my mind
And the only time I'm stuck behind the bar
Is when I'm thinkin' of the next line to rhyme
But this shit, I ain't even have to think about
Picked up the pen and the ink started spillin' out
I'm so high, I believe that I can feel the clouds
So I hope y'all feel me now
The way these haters grillin', it kinda tickles
'Cause they think that they got me in a pickle
But in reality, I'm chess moves ahead of 'em
And I ain't sick of people comparin' me to Eminem
Funny to me, the more money I see
The more places to go, different countries to see
I'm just turnin' up the heat to a hundred degrees
Spittin' like I got a razor blade under my teeth

[Verse 1]
There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in softly on the wings of a bomb
There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in hotly and it's coming in strong

[Refrain]
Lately, I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to wanna try? But

[Pre-Chorus]
Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings
Tryin' to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it comin' in me
Maybe by the time summer's done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holdin' you in my arms without lettin' you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are, because

[Chorus]
Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for it

[Verse 2]
There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in softly on the wings of a song
There's somethin' in the water, I can taste it turnin' sour
It's bitter, I'm coughin', but now it's in my blood

[Refrain]
Lately, I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
'Cause who am I to wanna try? But

[Pre-Chorus]
Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings
Tryin' to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it comin' in me
Maybe by the time summer's done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holdin' you in my arms without letting you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are, because

[Chorus]
Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for it

[Outro]
Yeah, whenever it does, we'll be here for it
Whenever it does, we'll be here for it

[Chorus 1]
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe

[Chorus 2]
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some

[Verse]
Came here just to sing for Clara
Lookin' for the baddest diva
Hol' up, let me analyse her, body lookin' like a hypnotiser
Come let me try some, suttin' you can climb on
Oh, you're a shy one, who you tryna hide from?
Baby, jump in the black ride and put your friend in the white one
I'm a Benzo addict, pulled up in traffic
Me and my friends switched cars and it looked like magic
They never seen such a skinny man in a big puffer jacket
That's unfamiliar, I came lookin' like a bodybuilder
Out here's windy, yana, you're the one that I'm into, yana
Don't you wanna see the interior?

[Chorus 2]
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some, oh hey

[Chorus 1]
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe, hey

[Chorus 2]
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some

[Verse 1]
Hey there, little boys and girls
Hey there, little boys and girls (Mmkay?)
Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob
(Huh?) Say hi Bob! ("Hi, Bob!")
Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
And he don't got a job
'Cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve-year-old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark
And fake like he walks his dog, drag 'em in the woods
And go straight to the chopping blocks
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face
And said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said: "Knock it off!"
But Bob wouldn't knock it off
'Cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her
(AAH!) And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want any—it's bad for you

[Hook]
The kids, the kids!
Don't forget about the kids, the kids!
Shady, what about the kids, the kids?
(?) The kids, the kids!
Shady, what about the kids, the kids?
You gotta save the kids!

[Verse 2]
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
Fuck no, you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Hehehehe!)
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy, it's the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old
After hangin' out with some friends
At a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys (C'mon!)
And the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse
And his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull {​​​*blblblblblb*}​​​
His back starts to look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin horizontal, barfin' {​​​*BLEH*}​​​
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
"H- hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!"
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing
Except maybe wasting the money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders
Hunched up like he's practicin' yoga (*gasp*)
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels, class
'Cause it's bad for you

[Hook: Teacher]
The kids, the kids!
Shady, what about the kids-
Don't forget about the kids, the kids!

[Verse 3]
And last but not least, one of the most humungous
Problems among young people today is fungus
It grows from cow manure
They pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up
And you put it- put it- put it- put it- put it-

[Intro]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I pull up in my new whip, baby, that's my new one
You ask me who my crew is, baby there's no new ones
And I'm just saying "deuces," I just need a new one
(I, I just need a new one, I, I just need that brand new one, yeah)

[Verse]
They just wanna play with me, they just wanna play with me
Just got back from the Middle East
Maybe just a little cheese, still wanna play with me?
Back to the crib for two minutes, I got something to do
Yeah, you get it
Yeah I copped something new, a new get-up
Yeah, phone coming through, you keep your head up
Gotta have all the new kicks, better have all the new tricks
And my bank go shit, gotta have all the new whips
Gotta have all the new chicks, my bad, I'm sick
I never had a problem with a money clip
Paper always glazed like a honey dip
I was always raised like "Honey, quit"
I'm just being funny with this funny ish

[Chorus]
I pull up in my new whip, baby, that's my new one
You ask me who my crew is, baby there's no new ones
And I'm just saying "deuces," I just need a new one

[Bridge]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I pull up in my new whip, baby, that's my new one
You ask me who my crew is, baby there's no new ones
And I'm just saying "deuces," I just need a new one
(I, I just need a new one, I, I just need that brand new one, yeah)

[Intro]
Ayy, yeah
That new Rihanna shit
That new Rihanna shit
Look

[Chorus]
That new Rihanna shit bump
Bitches in the back don't like me though, why?
I don't know, they wanna be just like me though, why?
I bet you none of them bitches would fight me though, why?

[Verse 1]
I guess they know that I'll cut a bitch
Boy, I'm already paid, getting money for the fuck of it
I'm on some other shit
So if you fly, what am I, do that make me the mothership?
Beam me up ho, they wanna see a nigga down
Take his crown, we be up doe, yeah we be up ho!
Now hit the ground, bow down to the sound
Good God

[Chorus]
That new Rihanna shit bump
Bitches in the back don't like me though, why?
I don't know, they wanna be just like me though, why?
I bet you none of them bitches would fight me though, why?

[Verse 2]
I guess they know that I'll cut a ho
Yeah I cleaned up good but I'm still out the gutter though
Don't forget this shit
You gotta problem? Then meet me outside if you with the shit
I've seen where the players sit
A couple racks gone just to watch 'Bron hit the layup, shit
I be on some nigga shit
But bitch, I'm way past nigga rich
Good God

[Chorus]
That new Rihanna shit bump
Bitches in the back don't like me though, why?
I don't know, they wanna be just like me though, why?
I bet you none of them bitches would fight me though, why?

[Hook]
I guess they know
Heard she hating though, feel no ways
I ain't fuck with that bitch, no way
Said that shit to my face, no way
Bet we shut down the place, no way
Bitches stuntin' on me, no way
They ain't fucking with me, no way
Price of fame, it ain't cheap, no way
I don't check the receipt, no way

[Verse 3]
Cole World, used to stay off his dick
I sold out the Garden, I should play for the Knicks
Took a couple minutes and I sold out Staples
A nigga getting cream like an old-ass Laker
But I ain't come to talk about all that paper
That's what they talk about when they ain't got shit to say
Can't understand why niggas never got shit to do
You know they sayin' same shit, nigga, different day
I never felt that, no way
Cuz on the same day a nigga doing different shit
Spit different flows, hit different chicks
Let my Brixton hoes feed me fish n' chips
Why I do a lot of shows, I'm the shit that's it
Got suicidal doors, I just slit my wrists
Never stingy with the hoes, word to Cliff and Chris
If I fuck six bitches I got six assists

[Chorus]
That new Rihanna shit bump
Bitches in the back don't like me though, why?
I don't know, they wanna be just like me though, why?
I bet you none of them bitches would fight me though, why?

[Hook]
I guess they know
Heard she hating though, feel no ways
I ain't fuck with that bitch, no way
Said that shit to my face, no way
Bet we shut down the place, no way
Bitches stuntin' on me, no way
They ain't fucking with me, no way
Price of fame, it ain't cheap, no way
I don't check the receipt, no way
That new Rihanna shit bump
That new Rihanna shit bump
Our glorious city
Was build by the divinities
By gods
Who saw fit to bestow
The gift of a paradise
Peaceful and harmonious upon
Us mere mortals below

And made El Dorado
The magnificent and golden
One thousand years ago
El Dorado
El Dorado
El Dorado
Look out new world here we come
Brave, intrepid, and then some
Pioneers of maximum audacity whose résumés
Show that we are just the team
To live where others merely dream
Building up a head of steam
On the trail we blaze

Changing legend into fact
We shall ride into history
Turning myth into truth
We shall surely gaze
On the sweet unfolding
Of an antique mystery
All will be revealed
On the trail we blaze

Paradise is close at hand
Shangri-La
The Promised Land
Seventh Heaven on demand
Quite unusual nowadays
Virgin vistas undefiled
Minds and bodies running wild
In the man, behold the child
On the trail we blaze
The trail we blaze
Is a road uncharted
Through terra incognita to a golden shrine
No place for the traveller to be faint-hearted
We are part of the sumptuous grand design

Changing legend into fact
We shall ride into history
Turning myth into truth
We shall surely gaze
On the sweet unfolding
Of an antique mystery
All will be revealed
On the trail we blaze

[ELTON JOHN]
There isn't much I haven't shared
With you along the road
And through it all there'd always be
Tomorrow's episode
Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue beckoning
The great divide
Ask no questions, take no side
Who's to say who's right or wrong?
Whose course is braver run?
All I know is all we had
Is over, said, and done
Friends never say goodbye
Friends never say goodbye

Friends never say goodbye
Never say goodbye

Friends never say goodbye
Friends never say goodbye
(spoken)

[MIGUEL]
Well, good luck

[TULIO]
Yeah, you too

[ELTON JOHN, sung]
Never say goodbye
The more I learn, the more I see
The less the world impassions me
The hungry heart, the roving eye
Have come to rest, do not apply
The frantic chase, the crazy ride
The thrill has gone, I step aside

I'd believe in anything were it not for you
Showing me by just existing only this is true
I love you
I love you
Without question, I love you

I'd believe in anything were it not for you
Showing me by just existing only this is true
Oh, I love you
I love you
Without question, I love you

[Chorus: OJ da Juiceman]
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, aye
Quarter pound, half a pound, whole pound, okay
Hundred pills, thousand pills, serving major weight
Juiceman and Gucci Mane make the trap, "Aye!"
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, aye
Quarter pound, half a pound, whole pound, okay
Hundred pills, thousand pills, serving major weight
Juiceman and Gucci Mane make the trap, "Aye!"

[Verse: Gucci Mane]
I'm twerking birds in, so we working
Packing a truck, stop, a trailer back in
We big flip jugs, we took it off the forklift
The way my plug kick it, you'd think he had a black belt
My scale so big, Big Boy can weigh his damn self
Two thousand pounds of mid, I sold that shit my damn self
Washer full of cash, dryer full of X pills
Red rag in my pocket same color my 'Vette is
My number lower than a eeé from Texas
A quarter mill in the mail is an investment
A sniper rifle like a soldier in the desert
An Eagle on me, boy, I'm known to tote a Desert
I sacked an ounce up before I sold a record
He want a brick, I told him, "Meet me by the Checker's"
I sacked a pound up before I sold a record
He want a bale, I told him, "Meet me by the Checker's"

[Chorus: OJ da Juiceman]
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, aye
Quarter pound, half a pound, whole pound, okay
Hundred pills, thousand pills, serving major weight
Juiceman and Gucci Mane make the trap, "Aye!"

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Look, open your eyes, déjà vu
In ways I knew my focus remains on you
I'm so true, I love that, 'cause who woulda knew?
LBC, me? Do what it do
Question? Is your bathwater ready for ya?
'Cause I could be the man for ya
Baby, are your bills paid?
Were those dinner reservations made?
The whistles, the bells, how 'bout your hair?
What about your nails?
See I can have it done for ya
Looks like I'm the one for ya
I'll crack the whip and get a little action in here, my dear
But first, relax a bit, the questions and answers are clear

[Chorus: John Legend]
A holiday
What you wanna do? Want to do with you
Let's make everyday a holiday
What you wanna do? Want to do with you

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
(Takeoff!) Smile at you (smile) I got my eyes on you (eyes)

But y'all know (but y'all know)

[Chorus: John Legend]
A holiday

Ahhhh, yeah, whoa yeah

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Take a molly like communion (Pop one)
My lil' girl like, "What you doin'?" (Flash one)

Sip and sip 'til I feel like a God (God)
You're my cup overflowin' (You know it, you know it)
Fucked up and you know it (You know it, you know it)

Everybody must know it (Ooh)

My God, I know what a blessing is
Thank God, I know what a blessing is

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Prayers up
Whole squad sending prayers up

Whole squad sending prayers up
Purple drank in my prayer cup
Whole squad sending prayers up
My God, I know what a blessing is
Thank God, I know what a blessing is (yah)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Smokin' loud, like to pour lean (Pour lean)
Luxury wheels that you know we in (Know we in)
Mama said she wants me in the church (Praise God)
Before the day they put me in a hearse (Thank God)
But I just feel like God when the liquor hit (Straight up)
If only God can judge me, then I'm innocent (Straight up)
'Cause every time I'm adding up my dividends (Yah)
At the same time I add my blessings up (Yeah)

Straight up, yah
It's lit, busy, busy, busy, busy
Alright, ooh
Straight up, yah, yah
Yeah, I'm up, yah

[Verse 1: Kehlani]
Pray to God, but I'm feeling like he's going deaf
Now when I lean on you and I got nothing left
Hey, I've been wanting to call ya, tell you that I'm sorry
Same old fucking story everybody sing

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Nowadays, I'm just a bitch to everybody else
(Fuck you and you)
I don't need no shoulders, I'm good crying by myself
(Fuck you, too)
Moving on's a chore, 'cause you know I still adore ya
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
(Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat)
I'm not gonna act like I don't love ya baby
'Cause deep in my mind, girl, I know I do (true)
Tried to search all through the world and not well
But I can't find a girl who looks close like you (no!)
I done made millions of dollars
But I'm still alone until I come home back to you (yah!)
I remember all of the times we were parked by your house
And laughed all on your avenue
Whoa, you can't front, you're a stone cold diva (yaah!)
I had to get counseling from my moms
She's a heartbreak teacher (oh, yah!)
Remember that time I put those pepperonis on your face
Made you a creature
Now I think about you every single time I eat pizza, ohh

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Post-Chorus: Jessie Reyez]
Why you holding me?
Why you holding me?

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Oh, she killed that shit
She was killing it, that was hard, bruh
I didn't know she could get that high but she killed that
Go Lani, go Lani

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Hey!
Now nothing ever last forever, no
One minute you're here and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
And do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me
The way you move it here (Hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (Hey)

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Hey)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (Hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
I'm your window shopper, sucker for your love, oh
I'm wearing your goggles, virtual reality
It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar
As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
And do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you? (Oh, yeah)
To memorize the way you shock me (Zap)
The way you move it here (Hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (Hey)

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Don't be afraid to catch feels (Ha)
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Oh-oh-oh, oh)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (Hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels (Straight up)
Feels with me (Woah)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Goddamn, I know you love to make an entrance
Do you like getting paid or getting paid attention?
You mixed the wrong guys with the right intentions
In the same bed, but it still feel long distance
She's looking for a little more consistency
But when you stop looking, you gon' find what's meant to be
And honestly, I'm way too done with the hoes
I cut off all my exes for your x and o's
I feel my old flings was just preparing me
When I say I want you, say it back, parakeet
Flyin' first-class through the air, Airbnb
I'm the best you had, you just be comparing me to me
I'ma 'at' this at you, if I put you on my phone
And upload it, it'll get maximum views
I came through in the clutch with the lipsticks and phones
Wear your fave cologne just to get you alone

[Chorus: Katy Perry & Big Sean]
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Don't be afraid to catch these feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Yeah)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (I know)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Woah, woah, woah
Feels with me
Don't be afraid to catch feels (No, no)
Don't be afraid, baby
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Woah, okay)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills
I know, I know, I know, I know
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me

Every time I see you, I'm spinning like the tops
Intoxicated lady, what you doing? Don't you stop
Every time you pass me by I see Heaven in yo' eyes
All at once I'm hypnotized by your sweet and charming smile
Oh
You're what's happening in the world today

In my sleep I see you, darling, and you're lovely as a queen
Intoxicated lady, you bring joy to my dreams
Every time you pass me by I see Heaven in yo' eyes
All at once I'm hypnotized by your sweet and charming smile
Hey
You're what's happening in the world today, oh baby

You're like a drink of something that's much too much
And get a kiss from you, it thrill me through and through
Now I don't know for sure but I think you'd like it too
Cause, oh little baby, you're what's happening in the world today
I said, baby

You should be in movies, in a fashion magazine
Any king would be so proud just to have you for a queen
A leading lady is what you are, girl you sho' nuff a star
You shall receive an award for the part you play in my heart
Oh little baby, you're what's happening in the world today
Oh baby, little darling
I know, I know
Don't my mama, don't tell father
No, no
Oh honey, baby

[Verse 1]
Do you still have the bones in your back?
Stop asking me that
I handed over all of me
Three out of three

I watched you break in two
I only wanted half of you
I fall into the trap you made
Fall into your face

Trip up over your thighs
The creases by your eyes
The scars on your knee
The mole on your cheek

[Verse 2]
Is this what you wanted?
It won't disappear
This fear of being haunted
By the soul I left behind
Remind me how I was with sentient skin
A feeling within
I fought it back into the chest

You lost me in the maze
Where pictures of your face
Were lucid in the haze
They took up so much space

[Outro]
Watch me as I go
As I flicker through the moves
Emotionless and frozen
I was going through the motions

Watch me as I go
As I flicker through the moves
Emotionless and frozen
I was going through the motions
Watch me as I go
As I flicker through the moves
Emotionless and frozen
I was going through the motions
When I first received this Nobel Prize for Literature, I got to wondering exactly how my songs related to literature. I wanted to reflect on it and see where the connection was. I'm going to try to articulate that to you. And most likely it will go in a roundabout way, but I hope what I say will be worthwhile and purposeful.

If I was to go back to the dawning of it all, I guess I'd have to start with Buddy Holly. Buddy died when I was about eighteen and he was twenty-two. From the moment I first heard him, I felt akin. I felt related, like he was an older brother. I even thought I resembled him. Buddy played the music that I loved – the music I grew up on: country western, rock ‘n' roll, and rhythm and blues. Three separate strands of music that he intertwined and infused into one genre. One brand. And Buddy wrote songs – songs that had beautiful melodies and imaginative verses. And he sang great – sang in more than a few voices. He was the archetype. Everything I wasn't and wanted to be. I saw him only but once, and that was a few days before he was gone. I had to travel a hundred miles to get to see him play, and I wasn't disappointed.

He was powerful and electrifying and had a commanding presence. I was only six feet away. He was mesmerizing. I watched his face, his hands, the way he tapped his foot, his big black glasses, the eyes behind the glasses, the way he held his guitar, the way he stood, his neat suit. Everything about him. He looked older than twenty-two. Something about him seemed permanent, and he filled me with conviction. Then, out of the blue, the most uncanny thing happened. He looked me right straight dead in the eye, and he transmitted something. Something I didn't know what. And it gave me the chills.

I think it was a day or two after that that his plane went down. And somebody – somebody I'd never seen before – handed me a Leadbelly record with the song "Cottonfields" on it. And that record changed my life right then and there. Transported me into a world I'd never known. It was like an explosion went off. Like I'd been walking in darkness and all of the sudden the darkness was illuminated. It was like somebody laid hands on me. I must have played that record a hundred times.

It was on a label I'd never heard of with a booklet inside with advertisements for other artists on the label: Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, the New Lost City Ramblers, Jean Ritchie, string bands. I'd never heard of any of them. But I reckoned if they were on this label with Leadbelly, they had to be good, so I needed to hear them. I wanted to know all about it and play that kind of music. I still had a feeling for the music I'd grown up with, but for right now, I forgot about it. Didn't even think about it. For the time being, it was long gone.

I hadn't left home yet, but I couldn't wait to. I wanted to learn this music and meet the people who played it. Eventually, I did leave, and I did learn to play those songs. They were different than the radio songs that I'd been listening to all along. They were more vibrant and truthful to life. With radio songs, a performer might get a hit with a roll of the dice or a fall of the cards, but that didn't matter in the folk world. Everything was a hit. All you had to do was be well versed and be able to play the melody. Some of these songs were easy, some not. I had a natural feeling for the ancient ballads and country blues, but everything else I had to learn from scratch. I was playing for small crowds, sometimes no more than four or five people in a room or on a street corner. You had to have a wide repertoire, and you had to know what to play and when. Some songs were intimate, some you had to shout to be heard.

By listening to all the early folk artists and singing the songs yourself, you pick up the vernacular. You internalize it. You sing it in the ragtime blues, work songs, Georgia sea shanties, Appalachian ballads and cowboy songs. You hear all the finer points, and you learn the details.

You know what it's all about. Takin' the pistol out and puttin' it back in your pocket. Whippin' your way through traffic, talkin' in the dark. You know that Stagger Lee was a bad man and that Frankie was a good girl. You know that Washington is a bourgeois town and you've heard the deep-pitched voice of John the Revelator and you saw the Titanic sink in a boggy creek. And you're pals with the wild Irish rover and the wild colonial boy. You heard the muffled drums and the fifes that played lowly. You've seen the lusty Lord Donald stick a knife in his wife, and a lot of your comrades have been wrapped in white linen.

I had all the vernacular down. I knew the rhetoric. None of it went over my head – the devices, the techniques, the secrets, the mysteries – and I knew all the deserted roads that it traveled on, too. I could make it all connect and move with the current of the day. When I started writing my own songs, the folk lingo was the only vocabulary that I knew, and I used it.

But I had something else as well. I had principles and sensibilities and an informed view of the world. And I had had that for a while. Learned it all in grammar school. Don Quixote, Ivanhoe, Robinson Crusoe, Gulliver's Travels, Tale of Two Cities, all the rest – typical grammar school reading that gave you a way of looking at life, an understanding of human nature, and a standard to measure things by. I took all that with me when I started composing lyrics. And the themes from those books worked their way into many of my songs, either knowingly or unintentionally. I wanted to write songs unlike anything anybody ever heard, and these themes were fundamental.

Specific books that have stuck with me ever since I read them way back in grammar school – I want to tell you about three of them: Moby Dick, All Quiet on the Western Front and The Odyssey.

Moby Dick is a fascinating book, a book that's filled with scenes of high drama and dramatic dialogue. The book makes demands on you. The plot is straightforward. The mysterious Captain Ahab – captain of a ship called the Pequod –  an egomaniac with a peg leg pursuing his nemesis, the great white whale Moby Dick who took his leg. And he pursues him all the way from the Atlantic around the tip of Africa and into the Indian Ocean. He pursues the whale around both sides of the earth. It's an abstract goal, nothing concrete or definite. He calls Moby the emperor, sees him as the embodiment of evil. Ahab's got a wife and child back in Nantucket that he reminisces about now and again. You can anticipate what will happen.

The ship's crew is made up of men of different races, and any one of them who sights the whale will be given the reward of a gold coin. A lot of Zodiac symbols, religious allegory, stereotypes. Ahab encounters other whaling vessels, presses the captains for details about Moby. Have they seen him? There's a crazy prophet, Gabriel, on one of the vessels, and he predicts Ahab's doom. Says Moby is the incarnate of a Shaker god, and that any dealings with him will lead to disaster. He says that to Captain Ahab. Another ship's captain – Captain Boomer – he lost an arm to Moby. But he tolerates that, and he's happy to have survived. He can't accept Ahab's lust for vengeance.

This book tells how different men react in different ways to the same experience. A lot of Old Testament, biblical allegory: Gabriel, Rachel, Jeroboam, Bildah, Elijah. Pagan names as well: Tashtego, Flask, Daggoo, Fleece, Starbuck, Stubb, Martha's Vineyard. The Pagans are idol worshippers. Some worship little wax figures, some wooden figures. Some worship fire. The Pequod is the name of an Indian tribe.

Moby Dick is a seafaring tale. One of the men, the narrator, says, "Call me Ishmael." Somebody asks him where he's from, and he says, "It's not down on any map. True places never are." Stubb gives no significance to anything, says everything is predestined. Ishmael's been on a sailing ship his entire life. Calls the sailing ships his Harvard and Yale. He keeps his distance from people.

A typhoon hits the Pequod. Captain Ahab thinks it's a good omen. Starbuck thinks it's a bad omen, considers killing Ahab. As soon as the storm ends, a crewmember falls from the ship's mast and drowns, foreshadowing what's to come. A Quaker pacifist priest, who is actually a bloodthirsty businessman, tells Flask, "Some men who receive injuries are led to God, others are led to bitterness."

Everything is mixed in. All the myths: the Judeo Christian bible, Hindu myths, British legends, Saint George, Perseus, Hercules – they're all whalers. Greek mythology, the gory business of cutting up a whale. Lots of facts in this book, geographical knowledge, whale oil – good for coronation of royalty – noble families in the whaling industry. Whale oil is used to anoint the kings. History of the whale, phrenology, classical philosophy, pseudo-scientific theories, justification for discrimination – everything thrown in and none of it hardly rational. Highbrow, lowbrow, chasing illusion, chasing death, the great white whale, white as polar bear, white as a white man, the emperor, the nemesis, the embodiment of evil. The demented captain who actually lost his leg years ago trying to attack Moby with a knife.

We see only the surface of things. We can interpret what lies below any way we see fit. Crewmen walk around on deck listening for mermaids, and sharks and vultures follow the ship. Reading skulls and faces like you read a book. Here's a face. I'll put it in front of you. Read it if you can.

Tashtego says that he died and was reborn. His extra days are a gift. He wasn't saved by Christ, though, he says he was saved by a fellow man and a non-Christian at that. He parodies the resurrection.

When Starbuck tells Ahab that he should let bygones be bygones, the angry captain snaps back, "Speak not to me of blasphemy, man, I'd strike the sun if it insulted me." Ahab, too, is a poet of eloquence. He says, "The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails whereon my soul is grooved to run."  Or these lines, "All visible objects are but pasteboard masks." Quotable poetic phrases that can't be beat.

Finally, Ahab spots Moby, and the harpoons come out. Boats are lowered. Ahab's harpoon has been baptized in blood. Moby attacks Ahab's boat and destroys it. Next day, he sights Moby again. Boats are lowered again. Moby attacks Ahab's boat again. On the third day, another boat goes in. More religious allegory. He has risen. Moby attacks one more time, ramming the Pequod and sinking it. Ahab gets tangled up in the harpoon lines and is thrown out of his boat into a watery grave.

Ishmael survives. He's in the sea floating on a coffin. And that's about it. That's the whole story. That theme and all that it implies would work its way into more than a few of my songs.


All Quiet on the Western Front was another book that did. All Quiet on the Western Front is a horror story. This is a book where you lose your childhood, your faith in a meaningful world, and your concern for individuals. You're stuck in a nightmare. Sucked up into a mysterious whirlpool of death and pain. You're defending yourself from elimination. You're being wiped off the face of the map. Once upon a time you were an innocent youth with big dreams about being a concert pianist. Once you loved life and the world, and now you're shooting it to pieces.
Day after day, the hornets bite you and worms lap your blood. You're a cornered animal. You don't fit anywhere. The falling rain is monotonous. There's endless assaults, poison gas, nerve gas, morphine, burning streams of gasoline, scavenging and scabbing for food, influenza, typhus, dysentery. Life is breaking down all around you, and the shells are whistling. This is the lower region of hell. Mud, barbed wire, rat-filled trenches, rats eating the intestines of dead men, trenches filled with filth and excrement. Someone shouts, "Hey, you there. Stand and fight."

Who knows how long this mess will go on? Warfare has no limits. You're being annihilated, and that leg of yours is bleeding too much. You killed a man yesterday, and you spoke to his corpse. You told him after this is over, you'll spend the rest of your life looking after his family. Who's profiting here? The leaders and the generals gain fame, and many others profit financially. But you're doing the dirty work. One of your comrades says, "Wait a minute, where are you going?" And you say, "Leave me alone, I'll be back in a minute." Then you walk out into the woods of death hunting for a piece of sausage. You can't see how anybody in civilian life has any kind of purpose at all. All their worries, all their desires – you can't comprehend it.

More machine guns rattle, more parts of bodies hanging from wires, more pieces of arms and legs and skulls where butterflies perch on teeth, more hideous wounds, pus coming out of every pore, lung wounds, wounds too big for the body, gas-blowing cadavers, and dead bodies making retching noises. Death is everywhere. Nothing else is possible. Someone will kill you and use your dead body for target practice. Boots, too. They're your prized possession. But soon they'll be on somebody else's feet.

There's Froggies coming through the trees. Merciless bastards. Your shells are running out. "It's not fair to come at us again so soon," you say. One of your companions is laying in the dirt, and you want to take him to the field hospital. Someone else says, "You might save yourself a trip." "What do you mean?" "Turn him over, you'll see what I mean."

You wait to hear the news. You don't understand why the war isn't over. The army is so strapped for replacement troops that they're drafting young boys who are of little military use, but they're draftin' ‘em anyway because they're running out of men. Sickness and humiliation have broken your heart. You were betrayed by your parents, your schoolmasters, your ministers, and even your own government.

The general with the slowly smoked cigar betrayed you too – turned you into a thug and a murderer. If you could, you'd put a bullet in his face. The commander as well. You fantasize that if you had the money, you'd put up a reward for any man who would take his life by any means necessary. And if he should lose his life by doing that, then let the money go to his heirs. The colonel, too, with his caviar and his coffee – he's another one. Spends all his time in the officers' brothel. You'd like to see him stoned dead too. More Tommies and Johnnies with their whack fo' me daddy-o and their whiskey in the jars. You kill twenty of ‘em and twenty more will spring up in their place. It just stinks in your nostrils.

You've come to despise that older generation that sent you out into this madness, into this torture chamber. All around you, your comrades are dying. Dying from abdominal wounds, double amputations, shattered hipbones, and you think, "I'm only twenty years old, but I'm capable of killing anybody. Even my father if he came at me."

Yesterday, you tried to save a wounded messenger dog, and somebody shouted, "Don't be a fool." One Froggy is laying gurgling at your feet. You stuck him with a dagger in his stomach, but the man still lives. You know you should finish the job, but you can't. You're on the real iron cross, and a Roman soldier's putting a sponge of vinegar to your lips.

Months pass by. You go home on leave. You can't communicate with your father. He said, "You'd be a coward if you don't enlist." Your mother, too, on your way back out the door, she says, "You be careful of those French girls now." More madness. You fight for a week or a month, and you gain ten yards. And then the next month it gets taken back.

All that culture from a thousand years ago, that philosophy, that wisdom – Plato, Aristotle, Socrates – what happened to it?  It should have prevented this. Your thoughts turn homeward. And once again you're a schoolboy walking through the tall poplar trees. It's a pleasant memory. More bombs dropping on you from blimps. You got to get it together now. You can't even look at anybody for fear of some miscalculable thing that might happen. The common grave. There are no other possibilities.

Then you notice the cherry blossoms, and you see that nature is unaffected by all this. Poplar trees, the red butterflies, the fragile beauty of flowers, the sun – you see how nature is indifferent to it all. All the violence and suffering of all mankind. Nature doesn't even notice it.

You're so alone. Then a piece of shrapnel hits the side of your head and you're dead.
You've been ruled out, crossed out. You've been exterminated. I put this book down and closed it up. I never wanted to read another war novel again, and I never did.

Charlie Poole from North Carolina had a song that connected to all this. It's called "You Ain't Talkin' to Me," and the lyrics go like this:
I saw a sign in a window walking up town one day.
Join the army, see the world is what it had to say.
You'll see exciting places with a jolly crew,
You'll meet interesting people, and learn to kill them too.
Oh you ain't talkin' to me, you ain't talking to me.
I may be crazy and all that, but I got good sense you see.
You ain't talkin' to me, you ain't talkin' to me.
Killin' with a gun don't sound like fun.
You ain't talkin' to me.


The Odyssey is a great book whose themes have worked its way into the ballads of a lot of songwriters: "Homeward Bound, "Green, Green Grass of Home," "Home on the Range," and my songs as well.

The Odyssey is a strange, adventurous tale of a grown man trying to get home after fighting in a war. He's on that long journey home, and it's filled with traps and pitfalls. He's cursed to wander. He's always getting carried out to sea, always having close calls. Huge chunks of boulders rock his boat. He angers people he shouldn't. There's troublemakers in his crew. Treachery. His men are turned into pigs and then are turned back into younger, more handsome men. He's always trying to rescue somebody. He's a travelin' man, but he's making a lot of stops.

He's stranded on a desert island. He finds deserted caves, and he hides in them. He meets giants that say, "I'll eat you last." And he escapes from giants. He's trying to get back home, but he's tossed and turned by the winds. Restless winds, chilly winds, unfriendly winds. He travels far, and then he gets blown back.

He's always being warned of things to come. Touching things he's told not to. There's two roads to take, and they're both bad. Both hazardous. On one you could drown and on the other you could starve. He goes into the narrow straits with foaming whirlpools that swallow him. Meets six-headed monsters with sharp fangs. Thunderbolts strike at him. Overhanging branches that he makes a leap to reach for to save himself from a raging river. Goddesses and gods protect him, but some others want to kill him. He changes identities. He's exhausted. He falls asleep, and he's woken up by the sound of laughter. He tells his story to strangers. He's been gone twenty years. He was carried off somewhere and left there. Drugs have been dropped into his wine. It's been a hard road to travel.

In a lot of ways, some of these same things have happened to you. You too have had drugs dropped into your wine. You too have shared a bed with the wrong woman. You too have been spellbound by magical voices, sweet voices with strange melodies. You too have come so far and have been so far blown back. And you've had close calls as well. You have angered people you should not have. And you too have rambled this country all around. And you've also felt that ill wind, the one that blows you no good. And that's still not all of it.

When he gets back home, things aren't any better. Scoundrels have moved in and are taking advantage of his wife's hospitality. And there's too many of ‘em. And though he's greater than them all and the best at everything – best carpenter, best hunter, best expert on animals, best seaman – his courage won't save him, but his trickery will.

All these stragglers will have to pay for desecrating his palace. He'll disguise himself as a filthy beggar, and a lowly servant kicks him down the steps with arrogance and stupidity. The servant's arrogance revolts him, but he controls his anger. He's one against a hundred, but they'll all fall, even the strongest. He
