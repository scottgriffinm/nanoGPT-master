They hatin’ ‘cause they girlfriends on my jock

I let her lick the rapper, let her lick the actor
The next Will Smith then I be ballin' like The Raptors
If you don't want no drama in the club then don't act up
How can I run out? My money longer than a tour bus

New G shirt
Yellow Lamborghini
BBC shirt with a fresh pair of jeans
Black cars, spendin’ when I hit the mall
Ya can't catch me, I'm so ahead of y'all

Marco Polo, Marco Polo
Marco Polo, Marco Polo, ay!

Ay, hit me on my cell now
Hey, call me on my cell now
614-360-1668, 614-360-1668
Ay, ay, call me on my cell now
Bow Wow say call me on my cell now
Greed!
Causing innocent blood to flow
Entire culture, lost in the overthrow
They came to seize and take whatever they please
Then all they gave back was death and disease
My people were left with no choice but to decide
To conform to a system, responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide

AIDS is killing the entire African nation
And a vaccine is still supposedly under preparation
But these governments, they don't mind their procrastination
They say, "We'll kill them off, take their land and go there for vacation."

My people's culture was strong, it was pure
And if not for that white greed, it would've endured
My people were left with no choice but to decide
To conform to a system
Their minds enslaved, their souls encaged
I feel the rage, it's brutality can never be undone
But the sun is not yet set
The bass and drums and microphones a threat
That's when ya investigate the crimes from the inside
And see that they're responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide
Ya cram ya culture down my throat
Say I'm inferior when I find it I choke
You fill my mind with a false sense of history
And then you wonder why I have no identity?
Well, I'll strike a match and it'll catch and
Spread the insight we need
A tiny fire, burning bright
Shedding light on the darkness of greed

A yes yes y'all
And ya don't stop
Shedding light on the darkness of greed
A yes yes y'all
And ya don't stop
Shedding light on the darkness of greed

Yeah

Gettin' paid's just a regular thing to us
Cause if it ain't gettin' money, it's strange to us
And if you don't wanna smoke, you ain't gotta pay
Rolling up by myself trying to find a way
Floating away, floating away
Floating away, floating away
I, swear I got so high, last night I don't remember going to sleep
But I do know that these louis's go in my feet
And the critics they found how these lyrics do go over beats
Twenty-k shopping when dude go overseas
Smoking weed in the most expensive suite
Even though we ain't supposed to be living anywhere close to these people
How they gon' hate on me, I got more bread than most of these people
Don't wish that on my enemies, I pour a toast for 'em
And keep positive energy and have a smoke for 'em
Bombay and high-grade liquor for my niggas
Never seen a ghost in person, now she riding in one
Never seen a ghost in person, cost me five figures
That's like fifty g's a person if you ridin' with us
To the sky's limits
Roll some weed, and get high with winners
My niggas eating when it's time for dinner
Gettin' paid's just a regular thing to us
Cause if it ain't gettin' money, it's strange to us
And if you don't wanna smoke, you ain't gotta pay
Rolling up by myself trying to find a way
Floating away, floating away
Floating away, floating away
You, you lift my heart up
When the rest of me is down
You, you enchant me, even when you're not around
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down
I'm latching on babe, now I know what I have found
(I feel you...)
I feel we're close enough
I want to lock in your love
(I think...)
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love baby
Now that I got you in my space
I won't let go again
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching onto you
Now that I got you in my space
I won't let go again
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching onto you
I'm so encaptured, got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch
How do you do it, you got me losing every breath
What did you give me, to make my heart beat out my chest
(I feel you...)
I feel we're close enough
I want to lock in your love
(I think...)
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love baby
(I feel you...)
I feel we're close enough
I want to lock in your love

I'm latching onto you
(I don't want to let go...)
I won't let go again
(I won't let go I won't let go...)
(I won't let go I won't let go...)
This is in remembrance to the time that you were with us
And while you may be gone now you are always in my head
I hope you turn in your grave. In your grave. In your grave
I recall our codependence. I was always feeding you
Never ever leaving you alone
We'd never be separated. I could never function all alone
I would rather die so I'd say "Fuck it all, fuck this place!"
Obituary
It's the way that you'd made me insane. But I'd ask you again and again
It's not right
But those times I thought it was
Now I see all that you stood for
Funeral blues, nothing to live for
You're survived by a portion of my life but that's all you get!
And I hope you stay dead
I hope you stay dead!
Not a hymn or a prayer could bring you back
Stay dead
Obituary
We'd never be separated. I could never function all alone
I would rather die but
Now I see all that you stood for
Funeral blues, nothing to live for
You're survived by a portion of my life but that's all you get!
And I hope you stay dead
I hope you stay dead!
This is in remembrance to the time that you were with us
And while you may be gone now you are always in my head
Now I feel that this hold of mine has taken many forms
Still sometimes the rain can turn into a waterfall
The prettiest things can come out of the coldest mind, yeah
And even with broken wings, sometimes you find your way to fly

It's time to be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder
It's time to be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder
It's time to be

Now I feel that this soul of mine has had its many tolls, yeah
Still sometimes the pain is what we need for us to grow, yeah
So when it's time for me to look into my deepest side
I will, I will find a way to hold onto the love inside

It's time to be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder
Yes, I can be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder
Yes, I can be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder
Yes, I can be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder
Yes, I can be

See I can be anything I want to be
All I have to do is put my mind to it and I can do it
So what I want you to do is put your fist to the sky and say it with me:
I can be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder
Yes, I can be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder
Yes, I can be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder
Yes, I can be bigger bigger, stronger stronger, harder harder
Yes, I can be
I can be
Death Row
That's where motherf***ers is endin up

Dear mama, I'm caught up in this sickness
I robbed my adversaries, but slipped and left a witness
Wonder if they'll catch me, or will this n**** snitch
Should I shoot his b****, or make the n**** rich?
Don't wanna commit murder, but damn they got me trapped
Hawkin while I'm walkin, and talkin behind my back
I'm kind of schizophrenic, I'm in this s*** to win it
Cause life's a Wheel of, Fortune here's my chance to spin it
Got no time for cops, who trip and try to catch me
Too f***in trigger happy, to let them suckers snatch me
N****z gettin jealous (jealous) tryin to find my stash
Whip out the nine, now I'ma dive and pump your a**
Peter picked a pepper, but I can pick a punk
Snatched him like a b****, and threw him in the trunk
The punk thought I was bluffin, but swear I'm nothin nice
Before I take your life, first wrestle with these, mics
I listen to him scream, Tray Deee went insane
I guess the little, mites had finally found his brain
New Rovers pull me over, I'm sentenced to the pen
Remember that little, bird, he snitched and told a, friend
It's trouble on my mind, I'm with the old timers
And f*** five-oh, blaow blaow.. turn em into forty-niners

[Tupac sings]
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin like a thief, runnin through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...
Where they find me? 16 on Death Row

Dear mama, these cops don't understand me
I turned to a life of crime, cause I came from a broken family
My uncle used to touch me, I never told you that
Scared what you might do, I couldn't hold you back
I kept it deep inside, I done let it fuel my anger
I'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger
The brother in my cell, is 16 as well
It's hard to adapt, when you're black and you're trapped in a livin Hell
I shouldn'ta let him catch me
Instead of livin sad in jail I coulda died free and happy
And my cellmate's raped on the norm
And passed around the dorm, you can hear his a**hole gettin torn
They made me an animal
Can't sleep, instead of countin sheep, n****z countin cannibals
And that's how it is in the pen
Turn old and cold, and your soul is your best friend
My mama prayed for me
Tell the Lord to make way for me, prepare any day for me (why?)
Cause when they come for me they find a struggler
To the death I take the breath from your jugular
The trick is to never lose hope
I found my buddy hangin dead from a rope, 16 on Death Row

[Tupac sings]
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin like a thief, runnin through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...
Where you find me? 16 on Death Row

Dear mama, they sentenced me to death
Today's my final day, I'm countin every breath
I'm bitter cause I'm dyin, so much I haven't seen
I know you never dreamed, your baby would be dead at 16
I got beef with a sick society that doesn't give a s***
And they too quick to say goodbye to me
They tell me the preacher's there for me
He's a crook with a book, that motherf***er never cared for me
He's only here to be sure
I don't drop a dime to God bout the crimes he's commitin
On the poor, and how can these people judge me?
They ain't my peers and in all these years, they ain't never love me
I never got to be a man, must be part of some big plan
To keep a n**** in the state pen
And to my homies out buryin motherf***ers
Steer clear of these Aryan motherf***ers
Cause once they got you locked up
They got you trapped, you're better off gettin shot up
I'm convinced self-defense is the way
Please, stay strapped, pack a gat every day
I wish I woulda known while I was out there
Now I'm straight headin for the chair

[Tupac sings]
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where we live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin like a thief, runnin through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...
Where you find me? 16 on Death Row

You take another pill just to kill another hour, ha
And then you're smokin' cigarettes and you're countin' dead flowers
'Cause you're crazy, and screwed two ways from Tuesday...

[Chorus]
Love is a liar
Makes you think you're on a high
When you're really just on a high wire
If love wore pants they'd always be on fire
Love is a liar

[Verse 2]
Candy coated promises they're always tryin' to sell ya
But there's a whole lot of stories that the books never tell ya
And you're cryin' and sleepin' in your clothes...

[Chorus]
'Cause love is a liar
Makes you think you're on a high
When you're really just on a high wire
If love wore pants they'd always be on fire
Love is a liar

[Bridge]
There's a reason for the rain and it ain't just the grass
'Cause the grass is always greener through a rose colored glass
There's a reason for the pain is what they say if you ask
There's a reason for the rain and it ain't just the grass
There's a reason for the rain and it ain't just the grass

'Cause you're crazy, and screwed two ways from Tuesday...

[Chorus]
'Cause love is a liar
Makes you think you're on a high
When you're really just on a high wire
If love wore pants they'd always be on fire
Love is a liar

Yeah, love is a liar
(Here we go good, two three, always push you in your face, can't eat, can't sleep, why's it always gotta be a liar)
Paroles de la chanson A Mother's Luv :
Time's rollin' forward
I'm gettin' bored
Layin' on my back
I'm loozin' track
Shifting patterns
And nothin' matters
'Cause there's no one here
And I've lost my fear
Well I've got no place left to hide
I'm running out of time
Moving slowly
The walls are closing
In on me
I can not see
Appearing fine, well
That's all a lie
'Cause I am not alright
Extinct inside
I'm runnin' out of time
My mother says I'm fine
A teenage suicide
No place to hide
Well I've got no place left to hide
No place to hide
I'm runnin' out of time
No place to hide
Ya, I've got no place left to hide
No place to hide
A teenage suicide
The Angel Is Mine Til' I'm Gone

[Intro]
Said I got, I got
And I love, I love
And I say, I say
Everyday, everyday
Said I got, I got (an angel)
And I love, I love (my angel)
And I say, I say (she’s an angel)
Everyday, everyday (she’s my angel)

(Wiz Khalifa)

Gone gone till I'm gone gone till I'm gone gone
Baby girl I'll be goin till I'm gone gone till I'm gone gone
Till I'm gone gone
Baby girl I'll be goin till I'm gone gone till I'm gone gone till I'm gone
But I won't be gone for too long

[Verse 1]
Daily, nightly, you are in my world
Words can’t, say how, much I need you girl
Still I’d, like to, try and find a few
To paint a, picture, of how I feel for you

[Bridge]
Inspiring, unbelievable, I’m smart enough to know
That only the real, could speak the truth
And I don’t lie, baby I need you

[Chorus]
So real, I hope you understand the way I feel, inside
So clear, there’s only one girl I want right here, in my life
And that’s the way I feel about you baby
No lie
I swear that there’s an angel missing from heaven, tonight
And the angel is mine
Said I got, I got (an angel)
And I love, I love (my angel)
And I say, I say (she’s an angel)
Everyday, everyday (she’s my 2]

Gone gone till I'm gone gone till I'm gone gone
Baby girl I'll be goin till I'm gone gone till I'm gone gone
Till I'm gone gone
Baby girl I'll be goin till I'm gone gone till I'm gone gone till I'm gone
But I won't be gone for too long

Lying, cheating, I would never dare
I’ll be, honest, that’s how much I care
For you, I’ll give, up the playboy rules
They’re overrated, when compared to you

[Bridge]
Inspiring, unbelievable, I’m smart enough to know
That only the real, could speak the truth
And I don’t lie, baby I need you

[Chorus]
So real, I hope you understand the way I feel, inside
So clear, there’s only one girl I want right here, in my life
And that’s the way I feel about you baby

And the angel is mine
Said I got, I got (an angel)
And I love, I love (my angel)
And I say, I say (she’s an angel)
Everyday, everyday (she’s my 2]

[Verse 3]
You’ll be the real, could speak the truth
And I won’t lie, baby I need you
And I only hope, you need me the same
Cause without you, I’m less of a man

[Bridge]
Inspiring, unbelievable, I’m smart enough to know
That only the real, could speak the truth
And I don’t lie, baby I need you

[Outro]
So real, I hope you understand the way I feel, inside
So clear, there’s only one girl I want right here, in my life
And that’s the way I feel about you baby
No lie
I swear that there’s an angel missing from heaven, tonight
And the angel is mine
All mine, all mine, all mine
All mine, all mine, all mine
Said the angel is mine

Gone gone till I'm gone gone till I'm gone gone
Baby girl I'll be goin till I'm gone gone till I'm gone gone
Till I'm gone gone
Baby girl I'll be goin till I'm gone gone till I'm gone gone till I'm gone
But I won't be gone for too long
When you were young
And your heart was an open book
You used to say live and let live
You know you did
You know you did
You know you did
But if this ever changin' world
In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die

What does it matter to ya
When you got a job to do you got to do it well
You got to give the other fella hell

You used to say live and let live
You know you did
You know you did
You know you did
But if this ever changin' world
In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die

Dippin' European linen with the v-net
Diamond studded vvs

Kunta Kinte bracelet
Lit up the whole set
My nigga we on deck
Best believe it's no sweat
Need street credibility, who you gon' get?

Don't want them upfront shooters

No one has seen before
When we're all alone

Chorus:
Your colors always change
You never act the same with me
Chameleon...
It's like you disappeared
There's someone else right here with me
Chameleon...
I look into your eyes
And I don't recognize the one
Who's sweet with me when nobody's around
Chameleon...
Later with the crowd
You start acting differently
It's impossible to figure out
What you're in this for
And what you want from me...
Re-chorus (x2)
(Ha ha, ay man, what they call you man?)

Hello I'm just a mellow fellow

And I'm a keep it ghetto
Cause I stick with it just like velcro
Cause I'm mellow (x9)
I'm just a mellow fellow

(VERSE 1:)
I'm real calm cool and collective
So when I walk in they know what to expect it's
B.o.B. in the session
Stand in and mister all this hate so it effect it
Now that's what I call interesting
I gotta gameplan but they can't intercept it
They can't do nothing but respect it
Because my flow is anorexic, sick, it's infected

(Haha yeah it's B.o.B. man, I'm just a mellow fellow stay real still like jello)
(CHORUS:)
Hello I'm just a mellow fellow

(VERSE 2:)
Haha it's B.o. bellow
All about the green ain't worried bout yellow
What does that mean?
Hah jaknow me and bread go together like hansel and gretel
Well in the ghetto
The cycle is a merry go round so you curse when they cut off your umbilical
I remember when life used to be miserable
But since my (? ) changed I've been seeing miracles

(Haha yeah man real talk
Treat life good it treat you good back)

(CHORUS: x2)
Hello I'm just a mellow fellow
Just give me a bud and a cigarello
And I'm a keep it ghetto
Cause I stick with it just like velcro
Cause I'm mellow (x9)

TREY SONGZ
I gave you prophesy on my first joint
But you all lamed out
It ain't really appreciated
The second one's out
Danger! Songs!

Your face is amazing, blazing, hot like Cajun; and all I need is a minute
Please, no gimmicks; ya tellin' me to chill
On the real, or take a trip to Satan
Sent me to hell wit' it
Then I yelled wit' it
Dude, the hell wit' ya crew
Say you got a man; well, the hell wit' him too
The seats is seashell, the whip is sea blue
And you can swim through
Ain't a lot of women that I can't swim through
And you can't say that I don't tempt you
'Cause if you said that, you's a liar
Grip them legs back, call me pliers
Z-4 chrome up under the tires
And you so grown, and my desires
To make you come
Finish that rum
Aye, who said Trey Songz ain't fire?

[Chorus:]
The way you talkin', girl, you seem so invincible
It's more than, sexy girl, the way that you take control
I wonder, woman, are you my kinda woman?
With a back like that you fly like jets
Are you my Wonder Woman?

It's a shame the way you do your thing
You can't blame me staring at your frame
What's your name?
Baby, they call me Trey
From the TV to the stage
The pr-pr-prince of VA

I got poppas like doctors
I can change your life
You should stop watching and jockin' as if you ain't gon' ride
I wonder somethin', baby
We gon' do somethin' tonight, tonight, oh

The way you talkin', girl, you seem so invincible
It's more than, sexy girl, the way that you take control
I wonder, woman, are you my kinda woman?
With a back like that you fly like jets
Are you my Wonder Woman? (Shawty)
Are you my Wonder Woman? (Are you?)
Are you my Wonder Woman? (Are you?)
Are you my Wonder Woman? (Are you?)
Are you my Wonder Woman?
What's this game, baby, I wanna play?
What you say can't let you get away
'Cause I don't wanna leave, girl
I only wanna be with you, with you

I got poppas like doctors
I can change your life
You should stop watching and jockin' as if you ain't gon' ride
I wonder somethin', baby
We gon' do somethin' tonight, tonight, oh

[Chorus]
I wonder 'cause I need a special kinda woman beside me
You my Wonder Woman; come find me
We can do whatever, woman, 'long as we together, woman
This ain't a game (no)
I need a super kinda woman beside me
Girl, I need a miracle
Anything is possible
Make your body be my home
Let me come inside, and we gon' see if you invincible

The way you talkin', girl, you seem so invincible
It's more than, sexy girl, the way that you take control
I wonder, woman, are you my kinda woman?
With a back like that you fly like jets
Are you my Wonder Woman? (Are you?)
Are you my Wonder Woman? (Are you?)
Are you my Wonder Woman? (Are you?)
Are you my Wonder Woman?
With a back like that you fly like jets
Are you my Wonder Woman, shawty?
The way you talking, girl, you seem so invincible
The way that you take control
I wonder, woman
Are you my kinda woman?
With a back like that you fly like jets
Are you my Wonder Woman?

If we could be super friends in your world
It'd be so incredible
I can't help but wonder 'cause
With a back like that you fly like jets
Are you my Wonder Woman?

[Chorus]
Come take my hand, I won't let you go

Hold my hand, just in case
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No we won't fade into darkness

Fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No we won't fade into darkness
This world can seem cold and gray
But you and I are here today
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
Nothing to fear but fear itself
We'll be ok just keep the faith
And we won't fade into darkness

Men steady comin' after you
Women steady comin' after me
Seem like everybody wanna go for self
And don't wanna respect boundaries
Tellin' you all those lies
Just to get on your side
But I must admit there was a couple secrets
I held inside
But just know that I tried
To always apologize
And I'ma have you first always in my heart
To keep you satisfied
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter no
Cause I got you babe
Nobody wanna see us together

Fight for our right to love yeah
Nobody wanna see us together

Cause I got you
Got every right to wanna leave
Got every right to wanna go
Got every right to hit the road
And never talk to me no more
You don't even have to call
Even check for me at all
Because the way I been actin' lately
Has been off the wall
Especially toward you
Puttin' girls before you
And they watchin' everything I been doin'
Just to hurt you
Most of it just ain't you
Ain't true
And they won't show you
How much of a queen you are to me
And why I love you baby
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter no
Cause I got you babe
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter no
Cause I got you babe

But it don't matter no
Cause I got you
The blazing sunset in your eyes will tantalize
Every man who looks your way
I watch them sink before your gaze
Senorita sway
Dance with me before their frozen eyes
I'm so much in love
Like a little soldier catching butterflies
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too
In the heat of the morning
In the shadow I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
I'll tie a knot in rainbow's end, organise the breeze
Light my candle from the sun
I'll give you daylight for a friend
I'll do all of these
I'll prove that it can be done, I'm so much in love
Like the ragged boy who races with the wind
No man loved like I love you
Wouldn't you like to love me too
In the heat of the morning
In the shadow I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
In the heat of the morning
In the shadow I'll clip your wings
And I'll tell you I love you
In the heat of the morning
Oh yeah, all day, all the way
Ooh

You know, sometimes
It seems like everything is going wrong
And sometimes we don't know how we'll make ends meet
Or keep on moving on

Sometime we get a little lost
Lost along the way
But there's always that hand
Keeps me running back to you
Oh, oh

He's been so good to me
Oh, yeah
And I can't seem to explain why it is
Every time I, I get to feel this way
I just have to remember that

You've got the power
Power
He's got the power
Oh, yeah
Power
When you're in trouble
Don't know what to do
He'll always be there
Come through for you
Power
He's, He's got the power
Always, always be there
Always be there for you, just hold on

[power]
Real strong

[power]

Wind, the rain, storms
You better know that
He's

[power]
Make a way for you

[power]
He's there, hang on
'Cause He's got the power

[power]
He's got the power

[power, power]
Sometimes the weak have to bear the strong

I'll always remember

[bring it down]
I'll always remember
When no one else was around
You were always there
You were always there
I'll always remember
When everyone wanted to put me down
You, You, You lifted, lifted me
Saved a wretch like me, me

I have to remember
You've got the power

[power]
Got the power

[power]
Power
No, you've got the power
You've got the power, power
Got the power
My heart's only power
Make me all right
Power

It make me strong, right
Power
Yeah, you know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt
Play on playette, play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse
It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got RB, collab' creations
Bump like acne, no doubt
I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch
A dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre making moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers
Shorty in down, good Lord
Baby got 'em up open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, has got game by the pound
Getting paid is a forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind, what?
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Pushing phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
As long as she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down, so I can win
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I gotta bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I gotta bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I gotta bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I gotta bag it up
She's got class and style
She's managed by the town
Baby never act wild
Very low key on the profile
Catchin' villains is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the words, spin's the verbs
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trumped tight, all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I gotta bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I gotta bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I gotta bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I gotta bag it up
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Hey yo, that girl looks good
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Play on, play on playette
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
You're my kind of girl, no diggity
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Hey
'Cause that's my peeps and we row G
Flying first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me, not a motherfucker thing
Cartier wooded frames sported by my shortie
As for me, icy gleaming pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
I shows and proves, no doubt, I be takin' you, so
Please excuse, if I come across rude
That's just me and that's how the playettes got to be
Stay kicking game with a capital G
Axe the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my flava
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncy
I be sitting in car, let's say around 3: 30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I gotta bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I gotta bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I gotta bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I gotta bag it up

MEEK MILL
If I could take the time back, I would rewind back
The day my cousin asked my gran where his mom at
I want my aunt back and my dad too
They killed Shawty and Diddy that was sad too
I cut a couple homies off, shit I had to
Changed on me for the money, look what cash do
Thinking I’m rich, counting my money
Worrying bout mine, they should be counting it for me
I’m just adding up this paper subtracting my homies
Shawty be screaming how she love me, while bouncing it on me
She really don’t like me, she just attracted to money
She chasing the benjys, so that don’t offend me
Im just loading up my Glock, hoping that it defend me
When them haters try to kill me I’m clapping the semi
She giving me head, I’m grabbing her Remy
I just wanna B, like the back of the Bentley
Niggas say I’m Hollywood when I’m Hollyhood
Put my life on the line for them, shit I probably would
Switch that to probably woulda, They wit me probably coulda
Put'em on probably shoulda, but ain’t nobody realer
Niggas is so fake, I did my ID check
Kept It A Hunnit Wit Me ?, ain't met nobody yet
I treat them like the beat, cuz ima body that
Moving throughout these streets, that’s where you find me at
But you ain't gon be running round, like you made my life
I ain’t met a bitch yet, I would’ve made my wife
And I ain’t met a nigga yet I would’ve made my right
Hand, damn, never take a stand
Never tell them boys information on your fam
Never tell them niggas information where you stayin
Cuz they change like the weather, when you wake they're where you land
With that hammer in your face, askin for the cake
Ever seen one of your dogs transform into a snake
Ever seen one of them snakes transform into a rat
I be running through the jungle I could tell you bout that
I could tell you bout the drought, when the work got snapped
Whole hood started robbing, everybody got strapped
Whole team just was broke, everybody got back
I was selling Sour Diesel, everybody got crack
It’s obvious I’m hot, it’s obvious you cold
Presidential on my wrist, and it’s obvious its gold
Whole hood got your statements it’s obvious you told
Like a Lil Wayne album it’s obvious you sold
I’m on some shit, running neck and neck with Vick
Trying to bring my city back, take us to where we never been
I’m just in the studio working like a Mexican
And they tell me I’m a rookie doing it like a veteran
Yea, big dreams small city
Trying to come up on me, but would you fall with me?
Would you clutch that hammer and bust it off with me?
Hundred miles an hour running from the law with me?
I ain’t think so, I just blink slow
Million ways to get this money but we think snow
Every time I see a chick I just think ho
And every time I meet a nigga I just think Po’
Alpo ass niggas!
Moment for life, for life
I'mma keep it real for life
And I'mma keep getting money, fuckin' bitches for life, for life, for life
Yeah, yeah!
There's a light, a certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be
Lived with you, lived with you
There's a way, everybody say
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I ain't got you, ain't got you

Baby, you don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

In my brain I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
And I'm blind, so, so, so very blind
I'm a man, can't you see what I am?
I live and I breathe for you
But what good does it do
If I ain't got you, ain't got you
Baby, you don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

Oh no, you don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

No, no, no no, no, you don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody

Tumbleweed
Your inner beauty is a peace sign to me
Life is full of little tricks and
We can always pick up sticks and build again
That’s what we do

[Verse 2]
Harmony
The way we hold on when we tumble through the night
Life is full of strange delights and
In the darkness we find lights to make our way
Back home again

I’m baring my soul to you
Tumbleweed
It’s all that I’ve got that’s true

With your confusion, your happiness and delight
It will only hurt a moment
Then it’s gone and you can see there’s nothing left
To leave a mark

Care for your kind, in the way you always do
When the flower moon is shining
It’s eclipse and your lips smiling comfort me
And I comfort you

[Verse 1]
Came out the water
And you know I'm swaggin'
Twenty gold chains cuz' I'm down to make it happen
Automatic shots leave you dead in yo' actions
When I walk around man I'm hoppin' out the (?)
Gold grill shawty and I think that I'm the best
Got all these hoes on me, bitch I think I'm Kanye West
Young Soulja came out the water like I fell, bitch
Pistol on my hip, hoe I take you on a trip
Man I will not slip
Catch me countin' stupid greens
Got so much money, bouncin' like a trampoline
When I'm in the club, bitch you know I'm in the V.I.P
I got all them racks on me, I got all the cash on me
Soulja

[Chorus]
Came out the water
Swag cross the border
Black girl, white girl, go on take yo' order
If you ain't talkin' money then it's not important
I'm so important
Very important

Came out the water
Swag cross the border
Black girl, white girl, go on take yo' order
If, you ain't talkin' money then it's not important
I'm so important
Came out the water

[Verse 4]
I swag just like Drizzy

Ridin' around my trap, better yet my fuckin' city

So much cash, mayne, rockin' out the Stussy

Bitch I'm throwin' too much weight
Bitch I'm headin' to the cake
Tell a bitch to pop her breaks
Tell a bitch to fix her face
Man I swear my life is great
If it real, why you fake?
Got that Hummer sittin' on eights
If you come to the

Damn, I'm the shit mayne

[Chorus]
Oh, killing me softly and I'm still falling

Say it real loud if you fly
If you leave me you're out of your mind

[Hook]

There's up's and downs in this love
Got a lot to learn in this love
Through the good and the bad, still got love
Dedicated to the one I love, hey
Still love the way he talk, still love the way I sing
Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain
Still all up on each other, ain't a damn thing change
My girls can't tell me nothing, I'm gone in the brain
I'm all up under him like it's cold, winter time
All up in the kitchen in my heels, dinner time
Do whatever that it takes, he got a winner's mind
Give it all to him, meet him at the finish line

[Refrain]
Me and my boo in my boo's coupe riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man, show him you the fliest
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it
Me and my boo in my boo's coupe riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man, show him you the fliest
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it

[Chorus]
Oh, killing me softly and I'm still falling
Still the one I need, I will always be with you
Oh, you got me all gone, don't ever let me go

Paroles de la chanson 1913 Massacre :
Take a trip with me in nineteen thirteen
To Calumet, Michigan in the copper country
I'll take you to a place called Italian Hall
And the miners are having their big Christmas ball

I'll take you in a door and up a high stairs
Singing and dancing is heard ev'rywhere
I'll let you shake hands with the people you see
And watch the kids dance 'round the big Christmas tree

There's talking and laughing and songs in the air
And the spirit of Christmas is there ev'rywhere
Before you know it you're friends with us all
And you're dancing around and around in the hall

You ask about work and you ask about pay
They'll tell you they make less than a dollar a day
Working their copper claims, risking their lives
So it's fun to spend Christmas with children and wives
A little girl sits down by the Christmas tree lights
To play the piano so you gotta keep quiet
To hear all this fun; you would not realize
That the copper boss thug men are milling outside

The copper boss thugs stuck their heads in the door

One of them yelled and he screamed, "There's a fire"
A lady she hollered, "There's no such a thing;
Keep on with your party, there's no such a thing."

A few people rushed and there's only a few
"It's just the thugs and the scabs fooling you."
A man grabbed his daughter and he carried her down
But the thugs held the door and he could not get out

And then others followed, about a hundred or more
But most everybody remained on the floor
The gun thugs, they laughed at their murderous joke
And the children were smothered on the stairs by the
Door

Such a terrible sight I never did see
We carried our children back up to their tree
The scabs outside still laughed at their spree
And the children that died there was seventy-three
The piano played a slow funeral tune
And the town was lit up by a cold Christmas moon
The parents, they cried and the men, they moaned
"See what your greed for money has done?"

[Verse 1]
Little boy under the shade tree
Come come, run here to me
I will pay you a quarter
If you be my water boy

[Verse 2]
Mister, you know it ain't no fun
Working out in the hot sun
Pay me a half a dollar
Then I'll be your water boy

[Verse 3]
Lil' boy sure sounds funny
You don't wanna make no money
Well, I can go down to the corner
And get me a dozen water boys

[Verse 4]
Mister, it's you that's funny
Don't wanna pay no money
Go on down to the corner
Get you a dozen water boys

[Chorus]
(Water boy) Can't you hear them calling
(Water boy) Yeah I do, but you keep stalling
(Water boy) Say, little boy you better hurry
Getting water to the men is your worry

[Verse 5]
Fifteen cents and a quarter
That's all I'm gonna offer
That will make you have forty
Now will you be my water boy

[Verse 6]
Fifteen cents and a quarter
That ain't what I asked for
But you gotta bargain
So I'll be your water boy

[Chorus]
(Water boy) Can't you hear them calling
(Water boy) Uh huh, but you keep stalling
(Water boy) Hey little boy, you better hurry
Getting water to the men is your worry

[Verse 5]
Fifteen cents and a quarter
Well, that's all I'm gonna offer
That will make you have forty
Now will you be my water boy

[Verse 6]
Fifteen cent and a quarter
That ain't what I asked for
But you gotta bargain
So I'll be your water boy

[Outro]
Ha, he will be our water boy
I will be your water boy
He will be our water boy
I will be your water boy
Little boy, you better hurry

[Verse 1]
I've lost the use of my heart
But I'm still alive
Still looking for the light
And the endless pool on the other side
It's the wild wild west
I'm doing my best

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm at the borderline of my faith
I'm at the hinterland of my devotion
I'm in the front line of this battle of mine
But I'm still alive

[Chorus]
I'm a soldier of love
Every day and night
I'm a soldier of love
All the days of my life

[Verse 2]
I've been torn up inside
I've been left behind
Tall I ride
I have the will to survive
In the wild, wild west
Trying my hardest
Doing my best to stay alive
I am love's soldier
I wait for the sound
I know that love will come
I know that love will come
Turn it all around
I'm a soldier of love
Every day and night
I'm a soldier of love
All the days of my life
I am lost but i don't doubt
Tall I ride
I have the will to survive
In the wild, wild west
Trying my hardest
Doing my best to stay alive
I am love's soldier
I wait for the sound
I know that love will come
I know that love will come
Turn it all around

[Chorus]
I'm a soldier of love
I'm a soldier

I'm a soldier of love
I'm a soldier
Still wait for love to come
Turn it all around
Still wait for love to come
Turn it all around
Still wait for love to come
Turn it all around
Still wait for love to come

[Outro dialogue]
Thank you so much
Well, we've been rehearsing for a whole lifetime for tonight so it better be good
Since I was a little girl, music has woven itself into the fabric of my life
And it's helped bring me back to land and put me on the right course when I've been lost, adrift
And it's helped me down the rugged road
So, for me to be up here making music for you, that may be a bar or just a reason to celebrate is the highest honor, it really is
And you're the whole reason, because without you there would be no point in doing what we're doing
So, for us as a band, we have to thank you for keeping the flame alive for us
You're always going to be the spearhead of our ambition and you love is always going to be king
Thank you so much
In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us
Teaches us to read and right
So called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge
And bow down to their God
Lost the culture, the culture lost
Spun our minds and through time
Ignorance has taken over
Yo, we gotta take the power back!
Bam! Here's the plan
Motherfuck Uncle Sam
Step back, I know who I am
Raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
It's the beats and the lyrics they fear
The rage is relentless
We need a movement with a quickness
You are the witness of change
And to counteract
We gotta take the power back
Yeah, take the power back
Come on, come on!
We gotta take the power back

The present curriculum
I put my fist in 'em
Eurocentric every last one of 'em
See right through the red, white and blue disguise
With lecture I puncture the structure of lies
Installed in our minds and attempting
To hold us back
We've got to take it back
Holes in our spirit causin' tears and fears
One-sided stories for years and years and years
I'm inferior? Who's inferior?
Yeah, we need to check the interior
Of the system that cares about only one culture
And that is why
We gotta take the power back

We gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
We gotta take the power back

Ah yeah we're gonna break it down
Aw shit!
Ugh!
Dont stop, and ya don't stop
Ugh
Like this, come on
Ugh
The teacher stands in front of the class
But the lesson plan he can't recall
The student's eyes don't perceive the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacent students sit and listen to some of that
Bullshit that he learned in school
What about that, the system ?

[Inaudible]
Come on
We gotta take the power back

We gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
We gotta take the power back

No more lies
Ugh! Come on, ugh
Check it

Take it back y'all
Take it back, a-take it back
A-take it back y'all, come on!
Take it back y'all
Take it back, a-take it back
A-take it back y'all, come on!
Ugh!
Yeah!
Let's go!
Make no excuses now
I'm talking here and now
I'm talking here and now
Let's go!
Your time is running out
Let's go!
I'm talking here and now
I'm talking here and now
It's not about what you've done
It's about what you doing
It's all about where you going
No matter where you've been
Let's go!
Let's go!

[instrumental break]
Let's go!, let's go!, let's go!...
There ain't no better time
I'm talking here and now
I'm talking here and now
Let's go!
Right now is where you shine
I'm talking here and now
I'm talking here and now
It's not about what you've done
It's about what you doing
It's all about where you going
No matter where you've been
Let's go!
Let's go!

[instrumental break]
Let's go!, let's go!, let's go!...
Let's make it happen
Ooh, let's make it happen tonight
Let's make it happen
Ooh, let's make it happen tonight
Let's make it happen
Ooh, let's make it happen tonight
Let's make it happen
Ooh, let's make it happen tonight
Let's go!

[Spoken Intro]
Baby, I'm tired
I just wanna lay back
Come here
Yeah, baby, come here and just hold me for a while
Ah man, it's been a long, long day
Couldn't wait to get back here to you
Hold me, baby

[Chorus]
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Baby, hold me

[Verse 1]
We don't wanna mess around with emotions
'Cause you know emotions, girl, can easily be lost (Oh yeah)
But I just can't help myself, I'm just so in love with you
I want you, I need you
Believe me that my love is true, yeah

[Chorus]
Hold me (Just hold and squeeze me tight, if you just)
Hold me (It'll make everything alright, if you just)
Hold me (I love the way you feel, if you just)
Hold me (I'll always be for real, sugar)

[Verse 2]
Here we are together
Just tryin' to figure out which way to go
My heart said "yes" but mind said "no"
There's something that's deep down inside
Just makes me want you more, if you just

[Chorus]
Hold me
Hold me (Yeah, yeah, ooh)
Hold me (I love the way you feel, you can)
Hold me

[Bridge]
I've been through so many changes
(You know, only once in a lifetime)
And I need someone, someone to call my own
(Do you find that very special woman)
Call my own
(And when you do, you'll never, you'll never wanna let go)
True love is so very hard to find
(Because she becomes a once in a lifetime find)
I'd never let go if I could find someone to call my own
Hold me, baby, ooh ooh

[Chorus]
Hold me
Hold me

[Outro]
You're loving me, I'm loving you
What can I say? What can I do?
I don't know what I could say or do
I don't know what I can say, what can I do?
Come hold me tight, never let go
Baby, tonight, I want you more
Can't you tell that I need, I need, need, need you
Hold me
Let me park my gun into your holster
Come closer, hold me
Hold me
Holding you is like a dream
I don't wanna wake up
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Baby, hold me
I am not trying to be right try to be wrong
I just try to make it on my own
I said I do a lot of things but I probably never change
I am not trying to be right try to be wrong
I just try to make it on my own
I said I do a lot of things but I probably be the same
Every time I try to get my life to get to someone it seems
What you are doing try to ruin my hopes and my dreams
Bless your way and always go get away
Keep some grams in my pants never hit a day
Am I wrong am I right
Do I care living life
On my own papa's home what am I feeling like
Musician premonition what you call it
Do your thing with . Back upon it
Recollect and reflect on how I used to be, I am probably the same way cuz
Cause im gon keep it G secretly you all are backing with me
So we expecting to get their photo come back stage and hit my ..
Cool individual I am never too good .. is from hood
Never from Hollywood
Chorus
I am not trying to be right try to be wrong
I just try to make it on my own
I said I do a lot of things but I probably never change
I am not trying to be right try to be wrong
I just try to make it on my own
I said I do a lot of things but I probably be the same
Growing up I don't know as much
I was too busy chasing money and all the stuff till I was old enough
Getting every dollar before so they could know it's us
Every party we are showing up bagging full of never too long nigga
Matter of fact you can have it the one in rotation my motivation is savage
.. and nigga think they are but they ain't no comparing
And they are not doing no harm but I think there is no comparing
I keep making deposits and no way no interference
I am your broadcast I just .. just smell .. when I go past
.. I am kind of hot but you should know that
Chorus
Am not trying to be right try to be wrong
I just try to make it on my own
I said I do a lot of things but I probably never change
I am not trying to be right try to be wrong
I just try to make it on my own
I said I do a lot of things but I probably be the same
Turn on a light, make it easy for me
Open your arms
Dance with me until I feel all right
It's good in the dark, good in the dark
But into the lover's light
Here comes another fight

So ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Bar me and hold me and cling to my arm
Here it comes, here it comes

And what you're asking me now, disastrous now
Hoping and hoping and hoping
The feeling goes away
All the way

Never change, never change, never change, never change
Never change, never change, never change
That's just how I fell in love, oh

Never change, never change, never change, never change
Never change, never change, never change
That's just too up there in love with
In love
This is the time the very best time
So give me a line and take me home
Take me over

But dashing the hopes dashing the hopes
And smashing the pride
The morning's got you on the ropes, oh

And love is a murderer, love is a murderer
But if she calls you tonight
Everything is all right
Yeah, we know

And love is a curse shoved in a hearse
Love is an open book to a verse of your bad poetry
And this is coming from me

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
In love

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
In love
Turn on the light make it easy for me
Fill the divide, fumble in the kitchen
Till it's right
What an awful sight

But there's love in your eyes
Love in your eyes, love in your eyes
But maybe that's just what your lover finds
All night

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
In love

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
In love

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you feel in love
Real love

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
In love

Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together
Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through
Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never ending
Wouldn't it be nice?
Maybe if we think, and wish, and hope, and pray, it might come true
Baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married
And then we'd be happy
Wouldn't it be nice?
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
Wouldn't it be nice?
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas

Inhale slow, no choke

Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale

[Verse 1]
Come all you fair and tender maiden
Be careful how you love your men
They're like the stars on a summer's mornin'
First they'll appear and then they're gone

[Verse 2]
If only I were a tiny sparrow
And I had wings and could fly so high
I'd fly to my false lover
There I'd stay 'til he loved like I

[Verse 3]
But as I am no tiny sparrow
And have no wings so I can't fly
Away to love somebody
Weep and pass my troubles by
Weep and pass my troubles by

[Verse 1]
You've taken the title of this song
From a life that's beyond
To something that you could hold on to
But is it wrong to sing along
When all of the words
They just get on your nerves
But the verse is ringing out like a curse

[Chorus]
I'm tired of this old refrain
Is the chorus you sang
When you had no one to blame
But yourself for singing it all in vain

[Verse 2]
You've taken the title of this song
From a book that goes on and on
Until you can't find the ending
Was it a funeral or a wedding?
Or a seance for the bride
Whose affection had died?
Though some say love is suicide

[Bridge]
"My heart it don't make any sense."
Was all that she said
When her love was found dead
The story was all in her head

[Chorus]
I'm tired of this old refrain
Is the chorus you sang
When you had no one to blame
But yourself for singing it all in vain

[Outro]
There was nothing but the song we were singing
There was nothing but the song we were singing, oh
Nothing but the song we were singing
There was nothing but the song we were singing
There was nothing but the song we were singing
There was nothing but the song we were singing
And there was nothing but the song we were singing

[Intro/Chorus 2X: Tyga]
Welcome, to a sound, to a sound, I am loud
I am loud, to a crowd, and the crowd, goes for miles
I am, what I am, to a fan, I am him
To him, his profession, a legend, I am

[Tyga]
I am, what a faucet, is to, some water
Water, and a chain, with a chain, I'm a target
Target, to a stalker, stalkin, not an option
Options, got plenty of those, many female partners
Pardon, my nonsense, time erased don't take much often
Often, I parties, party, get nauseous
You nauseous, be cautious, cause cautious can get you farther
My father was uh, never around, so some hearts are tarnished
But I'm sorry

[Chorus]

[Tyga]
Mostly, my writin, is cake, to the icing
Icing, on a track, on the track, I am lightning
Fast, when I'm striking, thunder, when I'm fighting
Fighting, for this title, and the title, reads idol
Idol, from the biters, they bite it, plagiarize it
They playin, while I'm grindin, grindin, through a fire
To a fire, I'm a lighter, to a pitcher, I'm a striker
A tyson, when it's violence, I'm solid, I am

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
YEHHH~! I am, Junior, young, ruler
I am, the +boo+ to +yah, boo ya, spook ya
True guy, who I? You are, scary
You are very average like fuckin missionary
And I am, not, I very no comparey
Son, daughter, I am, Carter
I'm eatin; I own my own restaurant dude
Go to the studio and hustle my food; sure I am rude
But I am, what I am, a black male that they could never blackmail
Crake sale, had Hell, triple beam scale
I am, the best rapper alive
And I hope the next rapper better than I
Now what are you?

[Chorus] - 1/2
You know I'm a crawlin' king snake, baby, and I rules my den
You know I'm a crawlin' king snake, baby, and I rules my den
I don't want you hangin' around my mate; wanna use her for myself

You know you caught me crawlin'
Baby, when the, when the grass was very high
I'm just gonna keep on crawlin' now, baby, until the day I die
Because I'm a crawlin' king snake, baby, and I rules my den
Don't want you hangin' around my mate; wanna use her for myself

You know I'm gon' crawl up to your window, baby
Wanna crawl up to your door; you got anything I want, baby?
Wanna crawl up on your floor
Because I'm a crawlin' king snake, baby, and I rules my den

You know you caught me crawlin'
Baby, when the, when the grass was very high
I'm just gonna keep on crawlin' now, baby, until the day I die
Because I'm a crawlin' king snake, baby, and I rules my den

Everytime I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Boy, tha doppy whip, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got 2 digits
Money stand like 8ft, just like 2 midgets
So shawty gonna trippin get some new chicks
Let me tell you what I did
And I bought a new whip
Filled it with some cute, bitches
While they was on IG, taking a new pic
I was in the bushes in the Valentine day
With a K, tryna shoot Cupid
Think im playing, for the cab 50 bands
And whateva's stacked in that Minnie Van
You pro'ly can't relate to what I'm saying, yall niggas
Talking up foul
I do some shit you pro'ly neva did in yo life
Well I don't talk about it
Trust me now, nigga, cause you ain't 'bout that life
Hustle Gang nigga, got a pro'lem with that?
Bring the motherfucking mob and the pro'lem begins
If you ever leave from me, ain't no circling back
I bet your bitch hang up the phone, you be callin' her back
Go hard as a mother fucker
Getting head from a couple broads in this motherfucka
Ain't no more fuckin credit cards in this motherfucka
Bank Roll count 50 large in this motherfucka

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
I'm so fucking awesome – my marbles, I lost ‘em
I'm taking everything – everything but precaution
Your bitches wanna call us, and text us like Austin
Pussy make me hard, pussy niggas make me nauseous
I've been on my feet since the day I started walking
Bitch, I think I'm MC Hammer, put the nail in the coffin
See coke in a drought, sell pussy at an auction
Bullets got a nigga runnin' fast enough to race horses
‘Round here, you sniff these lines, you don't cross ‘em
Kill your ass and leave you behind, like an orphan
I swear it happens all the time, very often
Still gettin' baseball money, Barry Larkin
‘Round here we play for keeps, yeah we eatin' but we starvin'
I get me a little money, try to spread it like margarine
I'm flyer than a motherfucker, all my flights chartered
Green kush, red flag, black car, white lawyer
I'm good

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I say, I go in in my beast mode – rappin' niggas I eat those
I tell a bitch take a deep breath then bend her knees like a free throw
I don't want me no good girl, I fell in love with these freak hoes
In my bedroom, I'll make a movie, it's starring me with that Lee Rose
I ball hard like D-rose, my stash on closet
Racks in my pocket, these racks I deposit
Got racks on my conscious, money on my mind
I've got shooters on my team, they've got bodies on their nines
Look at that bad bitch right there – see that body on that dime?
I ain't swimming in no hoe, you know I'm probably on that grind
All these niggas hatin' on me, me – but I ain't on that time, time
I be in that back, nigga, and I ain't talkin' 'bout swine
I'm talkin' 62 West, they say a nigga too fresh
You a rat, your homie singing, you should do a duet
Shorty say she love my swag, I make that pussy too wet
You niggas banned, and my hoes, and I'm like "why'd they do that? "
Go!

[Verse 3]
Um, I don't have a conscious – all my friends are monsters
They visit me so constant and talk to me about nonsense
Like stabbing you and then watching you fight for your life like you boxing
Bitch, deuce-deuce – I smoke that OG killer, Bobby Johnson
I'll ollie over that bitch's head, it's Hollygrove 'til I'm fuckin' dead
I did a bid for that toast, so fuck with me, I'll treat you like buttered bread
But I still go hard with no regard – Earth Day? Shit, bitch, go to Mars
Leave a nigga dead in the gutter
I just beat him with a bloody-ass bowling ball
I'm fresh as hand sanitizer – don't hate the game, just analyze it
Two Xanax, I'm fantasizing about fat bitches' panty sizes
Took a bullet to the chest? Be a man about it
Stop actin' like a little bitch, nigga
Most of y'all niggas is bitch niggas
I got a tiger in the basement, Big Tigger
My hair long and my dick big
My hair long and my dick big
My hair long and my dick big
My money long and my weed strong
I feed hunger, I no longer get my weed from Fee
I pull that freedom off my waist, now watch me let freedom ring (ding)
Aye Yayo, all i know is Yayo
Every time she hit the block that hoe she be on go mode
And if you try to rob me swear to god that be a no no

Sauced up and I'm loko and you niggas know so (snootie wild verse)
Aye yayo, yea i just said yayo

It happened on the strip where the road is wide
Tach it up, tach it up
Buddy gonna shut you down
It happened on the strip where the road is wide
(Oooo rev it up now)
Two cool shorts standin' side by side
(Oooo rev it up now)
Yeah, my fuel injected Stingray and a four-thirteen
(Oooo rev it up now)
Revvin' up our engines and it sounds real mean
(Oooo rev it up now)
Tach it up, tach it up, tach it up
Buddy gonna shut you down
Declinin' numbers at an even rate
(Oooo movin' out now)
At the count of one we both accelerate
(Oooo movin' out now)
My Stingray is light the slicks are startin' to spin
(Oooo movin' out now)
But the four-thirteen's really diggin' in
(Oooo movin' out now)
Gotta be cool now power shift here we go
Superstock Dodge is windin' out in low
But my fuel injected Stingray's really startin' to go
To get the traction I'm ridin' the clutch
My pressure plate's burnin' that machine's too much
Pedal's to the floor hear the dual quads drink
(Oooo pump it up now)
And now the four-thirteen's lead is startin' to shrink
(Oooo pump it up now)
He's hot with ram induction but it's understood
(Oooo pump it up now)
I got a fuel injected engine sittin' under my hood
(Oooo pump it up now)
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off buddy now I shut you down
I done been around the world
I done kissed a lot of girls
So I'm guessin' that it's true
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars
Don't nobody kiss it like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you, bang, bang, bang
Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you

It's 5 in the mornin'
Kush is rollin' while she's makin' steak and eggs
At 5 in the mornin'
We can only be about to do one thing (what?)

See, I told her
The devil is a lie
Them other girls can't compete with mine
You do it so good, you fuck my mind
You pull it out, then you open fire
You make me wanna tap out and retire
Your pretty lips leave me so inspired
I think that she's a winner
She could be a keeper

Cause she's such a good kisser
Got lipstick on my leg
Oh baby
She's such a good kisser
I'mma rain on this parade
Oh baby

I done been around the world
I done kissed a lot of girls
So I'm guessin' that it's true

Don't nobody kiss it like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you, bang, bang, bang
Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you

This girl, she's my hero
Get dinero, euros, pesos, francs and yen
(I ain't wanna check off either)
I'm starin' at your barrel
Pull the trigger, chitty, chitty, bang, babe

I told her
The devil is a lie
Them other girls can't compete with mine
You do it so good, you fuck my mind
You pull it out, then you open fire
You make me wanna tap out and retire
Your pretty lips leave me so inspired
I think I got a winner
Could be a keeper

'Cause she's such a good kisser
Got lipstick on my leg
Oh baby
She's such a good kisser
I'mma rain on this parade
Oh baby

Listen, the only thing I know
You give it to me, baby, with good flow
Don't ever run it back, come on, give up
Just give it to me, give it up to me, give it up to me
I can't keep my control
Every time that I see you hit that floor
Just keep on givin' it to me, I want mine
Just come on baby, just give it to me, give it up to me

Kiss it good, kiss it right
Keep it up, we be kissin' all night
Kiss it girl, kiss it right

Kiss it good, kiss it right
Keep it up, we be kissin' all night
Kiss it good, kiss it right

She's a kisser
Got lipstick on my leg
Oh baby

Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you

Kisser, kisser, kisser
By the look in your eye I can tell you're gonna cry
Is it over me?
If it is, save your tears
For I'm not worth it, you see
For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home
I'm telling you that's my home
You had romance, did you break it by chance
Over me?
If it's so I'd like for you to know
That I'm not worth it, you see
For I'm the type of boy who is always on the roam, mm
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home
Mm, that's my home
Oh, you keep telling me, you keep telling me I'm your man
What do I have to do to make you understand?
For I'm the type of guy who gives girl the eye
Everybody knows
But I love them and I leave them
Break their hearts and deceive them everywhere I go
Don't you know that I'm the type of man who is always on the roam
Wherever I lay my hat that's my home
Wherever I lay my hat, oh oh, that's my home, mm yeh
That's my home
And I like it that way
Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin

Biggie-
I know how it feel to wake up f***ed up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
And wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, sss***
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin to hear it
Smoking mad Newport's cause I'm due in court
For an a**ault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man
( you betta have your gat in hand cause man )
Akon-
Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin

2pac-
Our lifestyles be close captioned
Addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back
In the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlin' and heart be a n**** culture or the
Repercutions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and b****es
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve
Just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me
Protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious

Akon-
Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin
Gun shots every night in the (ghetto)
Crooked cops on sight in the (ghetto)
Every day is a fight in the (ghetto)
(oh oh oh oh oh) (ghetto)
Got kids to feed in the (ghetto)
Selling coke and weed in the (ghetto)
Every day somebody bleed in the (ghetto)
(oh oh oh oh oh) (ghetto)
Biggie-
I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, Who's next?
At last, I'm literally loungin black
Sittin back, countin double digit thousand stacks
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead

Akon-
Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto, Ghetto we livin
Cause thats the life when your
Living in the (ghetto) oh
Eating in the (ghetto) or
Sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto)
Thats the life when ur
Living in the (ghetto)oh
Eating in the (ghetto) or
Sleeping in the (ghetto, ghetto, ghetto)

Biggie-
(talking) It's a funny thing i kinda realized how powerful 2pac
And i was u kno what i'm saying cuz pac is a strong dude
Yo i kno him we two individual people we waged a coastal
Beef but even tho we were going thru our drama i would
Never wish death on nobody cuz there ain't no comin bac
Do do do do do do

[Verse 1]
Ooh
Your love made a slave of me
But the love you gave you took away from me
Foolishly, I believed in you
What a fool I was, thinking your love was true

[Pre-Chorus]
Selfishly, you broke my heart (My heart)
You were only fooling from the start (You were only fooling)
Still I have but one regret (Regret)
Although you're gone and I can't forget

[Chorus]
Why when the love is gone?
Oh, why does my heart keep holding on?
Why when the love is gone?
Tell me why does my heart keep holding on

[Verse 2]
Your love was sweet when it started
Darling, why'd you leave me broken hearted?
Why'd you swear to always care
Then you walk away and leave me in despair?
Heartlessly, you told me lies (Me lies)
Planning all the time to say goodbye (Planning all the time)
Still I have but one regret (Regret)
Although love is gone, I can't forget

[Chorus]
Why when the love is gone?
Oh, why does my heart keep holding on?
Why when the love is gone?
Tell me why does my heart keep holding on

[Bridge]
Ooh
Selflessly, you told me lies (Me lies)
Planning all the time to say goodbye (Planning all the time)
Still I have but one regret (Regret)
Although love is gone, I can't forget

[Chorus]
Why when the love is gone?
Tell me why does my heart keep holding on?
Why when the love is gone?
Why does my heart keep holding on
Oh, oh why
Tell me why, oh why
Tell me why, oh why
Oh why my heart...
Finally
She came along
Broke the spell
And set me free
Push aside
What use to be
All the broken hearted man that once was me
I never gave it up
I always believe
When shes in my arms i no what i achieve

So hear my lonelyness
Im giving up on you
I dont need you anymore
Ive found what i been lookin for
So hear my emptyness
Ive got no room for you
Ive finally found what ive been dreamin of
Someone to love

Heyyy
Cos i was lost
I was down and out
Untill that day
I knew what my life was all about
Still wonder how
She came my way
Shes the reason im smiling here today
So hear my lonelyness
Im giving up on you
I dont need you anymore
Ive found what i been lookin for
So hear my emptyness
Ive got no room for you
Ive finally found what ive been dreamin of

Someone to love
To hold
To be my inspiration
Someone to touch, to cherise for life

So hear my lonelyness
Im giving up on you
I dont need you anymore
Ive found what i been lookin for
So hear my emptyness
Ive got no room for you
Ive finally found what ive been dreamin of
Someone to love

Someone to love

Oh baby
So hear my emptyness
Ive got no room for you
Ive finally found what ive been dreamin of
Ive finally found what ive been dreamin of
Someone to love
Someone to love

[Part 1: History in the Making]

[Intro]
Yeah
It's another one of those...
Y'all niggas know
412, Wiz Khalifa

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I'm so incredible, wait, with no metal to waste
I flow great, and that'll level ya face
And I'll still let a nigga have it
You talk greasy but you still a faggot
I front on cowards cause you niggas backwards
I got my money right, game on top
And it's been said that I'm the key to put this game on lock
I'm from the city of the triflin' hoods
But when you see me, got a smile on my face
Nothin' sweet, it's just that life is good
Yea, I dodged the hood, slums came up out that
Rap game about that, to gain pay without crack
See I'm a youngin' with too much on my plate
To let some small change half a youngin' dumped in a cage
I seen niggas make sales
Niggas get knocked and make bail
And take lives, their worries ain't jail
With no regards for life cause their livin' ain't well
Who gotta make it to heaven cause they livin' in hell
But me, I don't do much just keep to myself
And stop these cock-suckin' mothafuckas seekin' my wealth
I was told the world's cold but I see for myself
And I'm too hot to take the backseat or the shelf
So I'm here, for some reason though, they hate it to death
The love's gone, only hatred is left
Only achin' and stress
A king not to be mistaken for less
And this here is for the taking, this is history in the making, yeah!

[Interlude]
Yeah
It's ya boy Wiz, man
Prince of the City of Steel, you already know, man
It's history in the making what we doing right here
Fuckers can hate it if you want to, just sit back and laugh, smoke and get money on y'all niggas, you already know
Ain't nan' nigga gon' stop my grind
Work too hard to get here, you feel me
Let's do it!

[Verse 2]
Where I'm from, it's kinda hard to trust
Cause the hate's from most of your own people
They're fake and they're all see-through
Hate to see a nigga when he's stackin' his bucks
Rather him be down in the dumps, and out on his luck
But I'll be damned if my grind stop
My mind tickin' like a time watch
And I'm gonna be spittin' 'till the time's not
Presently there, I touch minds everywhere
And I'll ride hoping heaven is near
See the pain in your eyes, young with every stare
I seek peace, but these streets will never be fair
Cause somebody done took Greg's life
Son reached, deceased
No time to blink or think twice, damn
Wonder when it's gonna be my time to meet death
I'm stressed, need to ease my mind
And unless one of y'all try to see what's mine
Then I'll eat through your flesh, bones, and leave that spine
You see I did the right thing
I stayed up out the gun and knife game
I knew about the pain it might bring
And we all got problems
I chose to smoke blunts just to drown 'em
The top, but I rose from the bottom
And I'm here now, ain't no body harming young
My screw's loose, they say something's wrong with young
Your time's up, I'm just warning young
Cause this here's for the taking, this is history in the making, yeah!

[Outro]
Yeah, y'all muhfuckas better play close attention to what's going on, man, that's what it is
Rostrum Records
What up Benjy! Yeah
Thanks for that doe, nigga, I needed that
What up Chad!
ID Management, ID Labs, E. Dan, Hub, BLAH!
What up Pittsburgh!

[Part 2: Never Too Late]

[Hook: The Stylistics]
Never too late, too late to stop-stop
Never too late, too late to stop-stop

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh
I'm tryna have the wrist all glitted up
Whip all kitted up
Niggas say Cam change, Wiz couldn't give a fuck
Spit it like my last song, one life, live it up
Niggas see Cam's change, kids couldn't get a buck
So please don't approach me man
Like this a free show, cause you don't know me fam
And please don't extend your hands like you know we fam
And please don't pretend like we homies, scram
Where was all this love at when I was only Cam?
When I was tryna sell y'all my only jam?
I don't keep friends, when we only fam
And take falls, I'll never, I will only stand
I'ma make this all riches, is what I told E then
If you don't know me now, then how you know me then?
And I hope y'all loving the kid, but if not, it's

[Hook: The Stylistics]
Never too late, too late to stop-stop
Never too late, too late to stop-stop

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm tryna have the strip all whipped out
Crib all pimped out
Chicks smiling in my face, tongues all licked out
Flat on the front side, back all sticking out
Waiting for that one time a rap nigga dig her out
But you gon' have to slow up love
Tryna skee cause she think I'ma blow up cuz
All she thinking is me getting her nails done, and her hair done
Ma, I'm not the one
I don't need no chick plotting all my chips
No birds tryna fly with me on my trips
If I am with a Miss, she a down ass chick
So take a sec, just chill and get off my tip
I'm just tryna get rich of these tracks I get
And you tryna get rich off the scratch I get
And you chicks think it's all about bread, but it's not, it's..

[Hook: The Stylistics]
Never too late, too late to stop-stop

[Interlude: Sample and (Wiz Khalifa)]
Cause I want to tell you, that there's no point in hating anybody
Because to the extent that you tear down another, you tear down yourself
(yea, yea)
We have to understand that

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm tryna have the city on lockdown
Fam off the block now
Money coming fast, more cash than the cops now
Would harass, but they can't really not now
Used to laugh, but your man's really hot now
I used to rap for the kids in class
Told em I would use rap just to get my cash
And I was only worried about how to get my math
And told my teachers and the staff they can kiss my ass
Cause I can't find a interest in my book
So I stayed to myself in every class I took
Supposed to be doing work, but I made my hooks
Cause I get motivation everywhere I look
And I show no regret for any chance I took
But I learn from mistakes just like I should
So if you dudes ain't paid your dues, for you fools it's...

[Hook: The Stylistics]
Never too late, too late to stop-stop
Never too late, too late to stop-stop
Oh no-there's got to be a better way
Say it again
There's got to be a better way-yeah
What is it good for?
War has caused unrest
Among the younger generation
Induction then destruction
Who wants to die?
War-huh
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Say it again
War-huh
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Yeah
War-I despise
'Cause it means destruction
Of innocent lives
War means tears
To thousands of mothers how
When their sons go off to fight
And lose their lives
I said
War-huh
It's an enemy of all mankind
No point of war
'Cause you're a man
War has caused unrest
Among the younger generation
Induction then destruction
Who wants to die?
Give it to me one time-now
Give it to me one time-now
War has shattered
Many young men's dreams
We've got no place for it today
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
But Lord, there's just got to be a better way
It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
War
Friend only to the undertaker
War
War
War-good God, now
Now
Give it to me one time now
Now now
What is it good for?

[Chorus]
My babe, my babe
My babe, my babe
My baby, my baby
She's so sweet to me

[Verse 1]
As sweet as honey
She make me feel like a bee
She walks like an angel
She got a ways like a child
A million dollar kiss and a billion dollar smile

[Chorus]
My babe, my babe
My babe, my babe
My baby, my baby
She's so sweet to me, yeah

[Verse 2]
I don’t need money, I don’t need gold
I need her love to satisfy my soul
With my babe I don’t need a thing
But a married life and a wedding ring

[Chorus]
My babe, my babe
My babe, my babe
My baby, my baby
You're so sweet to me
When you see him look him in the eye
Look him in the eye and he won’t dare to follow
If you need to, hook him with your right
Hook him with your right 'til he wiggles and wallows

He sleeps atop a bag of raven’s legs
Curled up rats napping by his head
Takes his eye out with a ball point pen
And makes nunchaku with his torn off legs

You wake up with a hatchet over your head
You wake up with a hatchet over your head

I can see you running
I can see you running
Gone in the blink of my eye
Gone gone gone in the blink of my eye

I can see you running
I can see you running
Gone in the blink of my eye
Gone gone gone in the blink of my, blink of my...
Open your eyes choking on his breath
Choking on his breath you grimace then smile
Take a toke of his wet cigarette
He picks your brains
You stub it on his chest

Slit his tongue with one fast hand
Stuff his mouth with the salty sand
Tie his arms with hair from his head
And roll him round like a rusty can

You wake up with a hatchet over your head
You wake up with a hatchet over your head

I can see you running
I can see you running
Gone in the blink of my eye
Gone gone gone in the blink of my eye

I can see you running
I can see you running
Gone in the blink of my eye
Gone gone gone in the blink of my, blink of my...

((Look him in the eye))
My little brown book
With the silver binding
How it keeps reminding me
Of a memory that's haunting me
In some quiet nook
I go through its pages
And peruse this ageless tale
Of the love that failed
To ever become true
On this page is the date
Of that fateful night at eight
When we found we were no longer in love
After that there's nothing more
Just a dark and futile door
That shuts out the stars above
My little brown book
I inscribed your heart vows
But since we're apart
Now this and that last sweet kiss
Is all that's left of you
Is all that's left of you

[Verse 1]
Now ain't it a shame all the tears that people cry
We ain't got it right in all of these years
Sorry 'bout that
There must be a way to live a better life
Break all these chains and get out of here

[Chorus]
You got to love God
You got to love yourself
You got to love your brother and everybody else
You got to walk that walk
You can't just talk that talk
You got to love God and everybody else

[Verse 2]
Heard some people say that all we need is love
It sounds so simple but it's true
Well, maybe today we will rain down love from above
And wash us clean and make us new

[Chorus]
But you got to love God
You got to love yourself
You got love one another and everybody else
You got to love everyone
I wanna love my neighbor
You got to love, love, love everybody else

[Bridge]
Hey, I want to believe
I got to believe
I want to be true
I want to see a miracle
I want you to see it, too

[Outro]
You got to love
I'm gonna love myself
You got to love yourself
Mmm, mmm, I'm gonna love God
Hey hey and everybody else
I wanna love my neighbor
You've got to love God and everybody else
Got to love God and everybody else
You've got to love, you've got to love yourself
Love they self
You've to to love God and everybody else
I want the band to come on
Walk the walk, you got to, haha, talk that talk
You got to get some respect about yourself
You gotta walk like it, you gotta talk like it
You gotta....
Oh my, my, my, my, my, my, my...my my my
Love God
Love your sisters and brothers, and everybody else
You should never fear
Oh oh tomorrow will heal our heart
Heart to heart we stand
Oh oh when you hold my hand forever
Time will pass us by
Oh oh you stand and never die
When, when we finally
And abnormally
For eternity
(Chorus)
The difference between a pimp and a street nigga dog
Is a pimp nigga work his bitch
A trapper work the trap, a pimp work the track
But a street nigga works his wrist
(4x)
Work ya wrist then, well work ya wrist then
I get my wrist game on cause my wrist game strong
And my wrist flexible like I broke my wrist bone
I got muscles in my wrist, cause the 4 touched the pad
I can't count every play I use different rubber bands
Red means 30 stacks blue means 10 packs
When I say Imma skreet nigga bitch I mean that
Hold up, Hold up, this shit won't cake up
80 thousand dollar profits so I bought a Jacob
Yeeaahhh, yeah that's my favorite word
Hit a plug with the herb and connected with the bird
He hurt he know homey where ya been dog?
Ain't no sense in callin' Gucci less yer buying 10 dog
I crossed 10 state lines just to bring the pack here
Go'n fill ya W-2s out cause I'm taxin'
I'll pay for that ass I ain't never been a mack
But ya front me a pack, I'll bring that money back
Gotta stay fresh, all white tee
Dark Gucci lokez so the boy can't see
Triple beam scales, 5 for the pound, 12 for the Q-P, it's goin down
Yeeahh, and I'm sick wit it I got major cake
And I blow 50 Gs on a rainy day
I got hard white, I'm with Gucci Mane
We fuckin 50 hoes cause they some Gucci fans
There's a stack dirty, there's a plaque dirty
His jeans cut and his slacks dirty
Blowin bubble gum, we gettin blew down
Like it's Mardi Gras, we got the top down
Imma chef too, name Dough Boy
Call me Boston, Georgia, or just blow boy
Fucked a bitch who's gettin stacked
Keep it moving less you movin' this pack
Whatcha say Gucci?
I was thinking out loud

Sackin Gary Payton I was gonna buy T-O

D-boy swag mane, shawty that's what I got
Got that Larry Bird yay, and it's jumpin out the pot
You be down motherfucker cause you know I'm too hot
Sick wrist game dawg I ain't talkin bout my watch
Want a chain like mine, but ya can't afford the price
You can call me frigidaire because I pack a lotta ice
You can spin the world like the Earth on it's axis

Gotta mean with some pea, wanna learn just watch
Nigga, red stop sign nigga roll kush stop

[Chorus]
As long as we're together
As long as we're together

I'm gonna keep on holding on
Until I reach my goal
Come and sing it

[Chorus]
As long as we're together

As long as we're together
(Everything, just as long)

(Hey, yeah)
Some of 'em lie about the *** they got
And what they do on the block
Some of 'em lie about the *** they pop
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life
So many *** wanna play but still got dues to pay
Some of 'em gotta beg a *** to stay
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life
Now this is for the B's and the C's, and the D's and the H's
And the G's puttin' work in overseas
At ease with the Doggy and smoke some ***
*** it, if my *** detoxin', it's more for me
Baby, this is presidential really
A pocket full of women understandin' how I'm livin'
Show them *** how you winnin'
It's the beginnin' with the pearls you're given
The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon
But everyday like 50 say, it's 'Many Men'
They wanna take me out the spot, they want the *** and the ends
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs
Then the *** then the clothes, I'ma have to let 'em go
You know how the Dogg roll, don't get it twisted
'Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit
A touch of the exquisite, mixed with somethin' pimpish
And it's comin' from the Beach where them *** is a beast
But I just listen, all that *** is in my past
I'm connected to the purse first, *** the *** last
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise
Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish
See me, man, I'm nothin' like you
I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
Leanin' in my ride, *** bangin'
Me, I'm ridin' by you on the corner, block ***
I'm livin' that boss' life
The *** come runnin' when they see me comin'
I'm livin' that boss' life
Can have anything, just don't *** with my money
This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South
Khaki's and them Tim's and them *** with the platinum mouths
Thinkin' that they blessed by the actions that be comin' out
When you in Magic City, you be carryin' a lot of clout
But trickin' ain't the route, that's even if you got it
There's a method to you holdin' it when they can't do without it
Just put the key up in it *** if she 'bout it
You can have her and her partner, *** with it for a dolla
If she a balla, she gon' ride with a shot caller
Roll with the Bo$$ Dogg in the back of a blue Impala
And if she follow, then she gon' ***
All the game you got to give her, be a different *** tomorrow
But I would never bother breakin' out 'Tha Doggfather'
'Less I knew that she was 'bout him, havin' diamonds on his collar
I'm just an author, spreadin' game to my partners
Walkin' on the blue carpet with the Doctor
You see me man, I'm nothin' like you
I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
Leanin' in my ride, *** bangin'
Me, I'm ridin' by you on the corner, block ***
I'm livin' that boss' life
The *** come runnin' when they see me comin'
I'm livin' that boss' life
Can have anything just don't *** with my money
We've been the best since I stepped in
Bring a hooker to the muthafuckin Jets Inn
In the sack, break her back like a Redskin
Need the dough like I'm trying to get the bread thin
Tree to make the head spin
Every season play the corner like I'm Revis
Light Caesar, heavy bearded like I'm Jesus
New York City, Queens borough be the backdrop
I bring it back to all the benches, need a blacktop
Big things, see me moving like a Sasquatch
Money, I'm in pursuit, cuchillo inside the boot
Bitches are on display, give brain
Inside the coupe. Shift gears, that's with the left
Which means I'm on the right, get paid
By any means, you hold it, say goodnight kid

Two fingers hold the potion when I'm smoking
Slow motion, snatch a snapper out the ocean
In my lungs go the drugs like the red chief
Red leaf lettuce blood money on the bench seat
12 courses laid up on the long table
Aged wine got me spinning like a dreidel
For fly women use a condom cause it's fatal
Hazel eyed bitched always blazing up the basil
The red razor cut the features in your facial
Creep in na, bumping Fernando Villalona
Puffing cheeba in the street by the chimi corner
Tu ne tappa me, muthafuckas are sloppy
Captain of the rap, you talking to papi
Up in Niagara Falls, make your wifey suck a
Bag of balls, it's sick, just like a Magic cough
Same person on camera or when the muthafuckin' camera off
Hash straight from the desert, can knock
A camel off, Sheep straight out of school
Let the hammers off. Off the boat shit
Whole cliques roll thick, no shit
Piss drunk and they smoke sticks
Not a word of English but
They hold the four-fifths
FILA jumpsuit, sandals, the whole shit
Young kids walking around, got the Desi in hand
Going "Boom Shakalaka!" like it's NBA Jam
Never speak to fuzz
Tap out the reefer, show him how
To use his sneakers, cuz
Roasted peppers, sweet tomatoes, heirloom
We on the beach, fresh Ceviche
We in Cancun, fly girly curly
Hair is getting read through
We in the shower give me head: shampoo
Swimming trunk, shoe accentuate the ankle
Eyes blue, put the children's money in the Banco
Giuseppe Franco, take the cash and tango
I'm straight stoned -sly, thank you
Bye, peace, one, fuck youWe've been the best since I stepped in
Bring a hooker to the muthafuckin Jets Inn
In the sack, break her back like a Redskin
Need the dough like I'm trying to get the bread thin

[Verse 1]
I gave her money
I gave her time
I gave her everything
Inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises
And secrets so untold

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
And a day we’d live as one
We made our vows
We’d live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It’s a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it cause I'm lonely

I can't take it cause I'm lonely
Have mercy
I can't take it cause I'm lonely

It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it cause I'm lonely

[Verse 2]
I am the damned
I am the dead
I am the agony inside
The dying head
This is injustice
Woe unto thee
I pray this punishment
Would have mercy on me

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
And a day we’d live as one
We made our vows
We’d live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It’s a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it cause I'm lonely

[Interlude]
(Now won't you tell me?)
Have a, have a, have a have mercy on me
Have a, have a, have a have mercy on me
Have a, have a, have a have mercy on me
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me

[Verse 3]
I gave her money
I gave her time
I gave her everything
Inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises
And secrets so untold

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
I'm so fucking awesome – my marbles, I lost ‘em
I'm taking everything – everything but precaution
Your bitches wanna call us, and text us like Austin
Pussy make me hard, pussy niggas make me nauseous
I've been on my feet since the day I started walking
Bitch, I think I'm MC Hammer, put the nail in the coffin
See coke in a drought, sell pussy at an auction
Bullets got a nigga runnin' fast enough to race horses
‘Round here, you sniff these lines, you don't cross ‘em
Kill your ass and leave you behind, like an orphan
I swear it happens all the time, very often
Still gettin' baseball money, Barry Larkin
‘Round here we play for keeps, yeah we eatin' but we starvin'
I get me a little money, try to spread it like margarine
I'm flyer than a motherfucker, all my flights chartered
Green kush, red flag, black car, white lawyer
I'm good

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I say, I go in in my beast mode – rappin' niggas I eat those
I tell a bitch take a deep breath then bend her knees like a free throw
I don't want me no good girl, I fell in love with these freak hoes
In my bedroom, I'll make a movie, it's starring me with that Lee Rose
I ball hard like D-rose, my stash on closet
Racks in my pocket, these racks I deposit
Got racks on my conscious, money on my mind
I've got shooters on my team, they've got bodies on their nines
Look at that bad bitch right there – see that body on that dime?
I ain't swimming in no hoe, you know I'm probably on that grind
All these niggas hatin' on me, me – but I ain't on that time, time
I be in that back, nigga, and I ain't talkin' 'bout swine
I'm talkin' 62 West, they say a nigga too fresh
You a rat, your homie singing, you should do a duet
Shorty say she love my swag, I make that pussy too wet
You niggas banned, and my hoes, and I'm like "why'd they do that? "
Go!

[Verse 3]
Um, I don't have a conscious – all my friends are monsters
They visit me so constant and talk to me about nonsense
Like stabbing you and then watching you fight for your life like you boxing
Bitch, deuce-deuce – I smoke that OG killer, Bobby Johnson
I'll ollie over that bitch's head, it's Hollygrove 'til I'm fuckin' dead
I did a bid for that toast, so fuck with me, I'll treat you like buttered bread
But I still go hard with no regard – Earth Day? Shit, bitch, go to Mars
Leave a nigga dead in the gutter
I just beat him with a bloody-ass bowling ball
I'm fresh as hand sanitizer – don't hate the game, just analyze it
Two Xanax, I'm fantasizing about fat bitches' panty sizes
Took a bullet to the chest? Be a man about it
Stop actin' like a little bitch, nigga
Most of y'all niggas is bitch niggas
I got a tiger in the basement, Big Tigger
My hair long and my dick big
My hair long and my dick big
My hair long and my dick big
My money long and my weed strong
I feed hunger, I no longer get my weed from Fee
I pull that freedom off my waist, now watch me let freedom ring (ding)
My stupid mouth
Has got me in trouble
I said too much again
To a date over dinner yesterday
And I could see
She was offended
She said, "Well anyway"
Just dying for a subject change
Oh, it's another social casualty
Score one more for me
How could I forget?
Mama said, "Think before speaking"
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do
I guess he better find one soon
We bit our lips
She looked out the window
Rolling tiny balls of napkin paper
I played a quick game of chess with the salt and pepper shaker
And I could see clearly
An indelible line was drawn
Between what was good
What just slipped out and what went wrong
Oh, the way she feels about me has changed
Thanks for playing, try again
How could I forget?
Mama said, "Think before speaking"
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do
I guess he better find one
I'm never speaking up again
It only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery
Than she desert me
Oh, I'm never speaking up again
Starting now
Starting now
One more thing
Why is it my fault?
So maybe I try too hard
But it's all because of this desire
I just wanna be liked
I just wanna be funny
Looks like the jokes on me
So call me captain backfire
I'm never speaking up again
It only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery
Than she desert me
Oh, I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
Starting now
Starting now
MARVIN GAYE
Oh, baby, please turn yourself around
Oh, baby, so I can love you good
Oh, baby, I'll make you feel so good
Oh, sugar, just like you want me to

Oh, baby, you sure love to ball
Oh, baby, you sure love to ball

Oh, honey, I hope you never freeze
I love you, I love you so much
Oh, baby, baby, don't ever go away
Oh, stay with me, baby, I'll love you night and day

Oh, baby, you sure love to ball
Oh, honey, you sure love to ball

Oh, now I just love you, that's all
I've got my mind made up, baby
Ah, there's no doubt, oh baby
That you're my foxy lady
Oh, baby, you sure love to ball
Oh, sugar, you sure love to ball

Oh, all I know now, baby
Hey, baby, is love you some more
Oh, come on in and let me love you
Oh, baby, climb the wall

Pretty little sexy, baby
You sure love to ball
Pretty little sexy, mama
You sure love to ball

Oh, I know, if we ever part
Oh, that one thing would
Surely break my heart
I gotta get ready for my baby

Ooh, you sure love to ball
Oh, baby, you sure love to ball
Oh, pretty little sexy, baby
You sure love to ball

You sure love to ball
Pretty little sexy, baby
You sure love to ball
What's the opposite of satisfaction? You never had it
A sex addict there when you needed it
Now you're too distracted by the little things
Cars, rings, none of it matters
Presidential suites in Nevada, you was too ecstatic
Time ticking, it was 24 karat
Mrs. HardHeaded don't listen but the head was terrific
Had a vision, you bought it, couldn't wait til you saw it
Swear you had it all and you already lost it all and you know it
Know I did it, I'm riding round with my new bitch
I'm popping bottles and shopping and flying private to Maui
Living life, no excuses, don't give two fucks about you
You seen my girl' ass lately? Now watch me fuck her crazy
Tell me when to stop
You know I ain't gon hurt you baby
Tell me when to stop
Girl if I start to get carried away
Tell me when to stop
I'mma li-li-li-lick it and go down
Baby you can get it
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop
She said I could take control of her body
But it's only for the weekend
Said I'mma let you do you
Oh yea, I'mma do you
Til she boom boom boom
I'm like a rabbit in her rib cage
Roll my weed darling
Just like it's her birthday
I'm tipping and sipping
Sparklers come with that Ace of Spades
I'm faded, sipping and leaning
I'm faded, sipping and leaning
Sparklers come with that Ace of Spades
I'm faded, sipping and leaning
I'mma fuck you like I'm in a bad mood, baby
Tell me when to stop
You know I ain't gon hurt you baby
Tell me when to stop
Girl if I start to get carried away
Tell me when to stop
I'mma li-li-li-lick it and go down
Baby you can get it
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop
Long hair, red lipstick
Lips burned from that cigarette
Versace heels and them latex
Neck collar, that that's a fact
I fuck wit you cuz it makes sense
We don't fight but this make up sex
Less is more but you more or less
Got the top down in my Corvette, yea
Red from the summer
Must have made a wrong turn, checked in a motel just to have sex
Like strangers fuckin out of anger
Putting on handcuffs, now a nigga chained up
Til the maid come clean up
Broken mirrors so you know that's bad luck
Lost my wallet, so would you hurry up?
Pack up, flee the scene, seen a chef just pull up
Shots of tequila, let's get freaky, looking for a reason
By the look in yo eyes you don't gotta say much, I can tell that you need it
And you need it just as much as I needed you
Word on streets, I pull work for two
Yo home girl wanna see if it's true
So just
Tell me when to stop
You know I ain't gon hurt you baby
Tell me when to stop
Girl if I start to get carried away
Tell me when to stop
I'mma li-li-li-lick it and go down
Baby you can get it
Tell me when to stop
You know I ain't gon hurt you baby
Tell me when to stop
Girl if I start to get carried away
Tell me when to stop
I'mma li-li-li-lick it and go down
Baby you can get it
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop

[Intro]
You are my everything
You are my everything
You, my everything
Everything, everything, everything

[Verse 1]
It's all because of you, I'm never sad and blue
You've brightened up my days in your own special way
Whenever you're around, I'm never feeling down
You are my trusted friend, on you I can depend
You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And when there were cloudy days you brought sunshine in my life
It never occurred to me the first time I saw your face
I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced

[Chorus]
You are my everything
Love so good only you can bring
You are my everything
You are everything and everything is you

[Verse 2]
My darling only you can make my dreams come true
And every night I pray, you'll never go away
I promise I will try until the day I die
To treat you like a king cause you are my everything
You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And when there were cloudy days you brought sunshine in my life
It never occurred
I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you

[Verse 3]
When you're lovin' me, put your lovin' arms around me
When you're lovin' me, said I feel so safe, I find security
When you're lovin' me, forever I want you to hold me
My everything, my every, every, every, everything

[Chorus] + 

[Bridge] +

(Verse 1)
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, And I'll be there
You are my love, You are my heart
And we will never ever-ever be apart
Are we an item. Girl quit playing
"We're just friends"
What are you sayin?
Said theres another and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time

(Chorus)
And I was like
Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oohh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby ohh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
(Verse 2)
For you, I would have done what ever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, But I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything, ill buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, Baby fix me
And just shake me til' you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe, my first love won't be around

(Chorus)
And I'm like
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine

(Chorus)
Baby, baby, baby ohh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby ohh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
(Now I'm all gone)
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah
(Now I'm all gone)
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
(Now I'm all gone)
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone, ooh
I'm gone
There was a boy whose name was Jim
His friends, they were very good to him
They gave him tea, and cakes and jam
And slices of delicious ham
Oh Mother tell me more

Why'd'you have to leave me there
Hanging in my infant air, waiting
You only have to read the lines of
Scribbly black and everything shines

The chief defect of Henry King
Was chewing little bits of string
At last he swallowed some which tied
Itself in ugly knots inside

Wondering and dreaming
The words have different meanings
Yes they did

Finding she was left alone
Went tiptoe to the telephone, 999
Summoned the immediate aid
Of London's Noble Fire Brigade
For all the time spent in that room
The doll's house darkness old perfume
And fairy stories held me high
On clouds of sunlight floating by
Oh Mother tell me more
Tell me more

[Intro]
Yeah
You know they say
God said
To whom he gives
Much is to be expected
I'm living proof of that
Got me drinkin' this liquor
Smokin this weed
I been through it though

[Verse]
You see before this rap shit, i ain't really have no problems
Now i gotta carry revolvers
Cause niggas is starving, and i ain't gave a plate out yet
Goin hard and i ain't played out yet
And them hoe niggas talkin, I got somethin to say 'bout that
They talk greasy, when they see me dawg, they ain't 'bout that
Niggas be friendly personalities and bang on wax
I'm 100 you can bank on dat, got my bank all fat
Yeah I'm doing my thang here
Heard my first track thinkin that's when I came here
Was actually raised here, but wasn't born who could give a fuck
My whole family as far as I can go back stayed here
It's not a mystery
This where I graduated high school, went to middle school and elementary
So don't say shit to me
Cause bitch if I ain't the prince, show me who the fuck it is, if it isn't me
You niggas history, I'm lookin like the future
Only know how to ball, something like a hooper
Swishas of that Cali bomb smellin like a fruit cup
Yeah, I got heart but never claimed to be too tough
But never said that my homies don't shoot stuff
Real street niggas, no talkin', just do stuff
In the club, Patron and lime juiced up
Reppin that Rostrum, Heavy Hustle, I'm trued up
I'm wit some dudes you used to see blued up
On our get money swag, we done moved up
Big crib, nice chain, the new truck
Some say I'm doing good, I say I don't do much, but go hard
Niggas say I wouldn't be shit with no squad, ha, ya so smart
Cause I was just 16, rappin' with no job
Met Jerm and Benji and now I'm a young star
E & Hard basically molded the young boy
That's why they do shit for me but they won't record y'all
Knew i was the one when they first heard the boy talk
Got a horror flick flow, came to murder all them off
Addicted to it now its like I'm servin all them soft
Got my pockets all fat like I'm Sherman off the Klumps
My money come in lumps
Y'all don't really wanna get funky
Nothing but a bunch of funny acting chumps
And I had shit locked since day one
I don't advise niggas to say nun
You something like a clone, I'ma be known as one of them great ones
For those gone, I roll and blaze some
Ya dug me?

[Hook/Outro]
Time just goes by
And I don't know why I stay high
(YEAH!
Shit crazy, man
Seem like... you know)
Time just goes by
(Niggas just wanna see you fucked up out here, man)
And I don't know why I stay high
(Soon as you start doing good, that's when shit change
They expect you to change, but you know...)
Time just goes by
(That's where we supposed to be
I thought we was supposed to move up
Fuck you mad at me for)
And I don't know why I stay high
(Ya know, got me stressed the fuck out man)
Time just goes by
(Looking left and right before i go in my crib)
And I don't know why I stay high
(Watching every move I make
And for what
Rest in Peace to Jayla Brown)
Time just goes by
(Rest in Peace Maina Wards)
And I don't know why I stay high
(412)
I'm dreaming tonight
Of a place I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know
It's a long road back
I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents by the tree

Christmas eve will find you
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have some snow
And mistletoe
And presents by the tree
Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams

Miscellaneous
Baby I'm Losing You
Ev'ry time we kiss I feel that something's missing inside
Ev'ry little glow for me has simply died
What has happened to the love
Happened to the love, the love we knew
Baby I'm losing you (losing you), baby I'm losing you

Even in my sleep I feel the heartache creep in my dream
All the love you had for me is gone it seems
Oh what have you done to me
Made it plain to see that we are through
Baby I'm losing you (losing you), baby I'm losing you

I hate to say goodbye to you
But darling what am I to do
Just a toy to play, when you are through, you throw away
Not me

If you don't need me now I'll get along somehow in my pain
Wish little boy, go find another toy for your games
And what's happening to me, I'll get by you see
Now we are through
Baby I'm losing you (losing you), baby I'm losing you
Baby I'm losing you (losing you, baby I'm losing you
Riddle me this my brother, can you handle it?
Your style to my style, you can't hold a candle to it
Equinox symmetry and the balance is right
Smokin' and drinkin' on a Tuesday night
It's not how you play the game, it's how you win it
I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic
For those about to rock we salute you
The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to
I once was lost but now I'm found
The music washes over and you're one with the sound
Well, who shall inherit the earth? The meek shall
And yo, I think I'm starting to peak now, Al
And then the man upstairs, well I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire
We're just three MC's and we're on the go
Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago
Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago
Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago
Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago
Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago
Only twenty four hours in a day
Only twelve notes well a man can play
Music for all, and not just one people
And now we're gonna bust with the Putney Swope sequel
More Adidas sneakers that a plumber's got pliers
Got more suitst than Jacoby and Meyers
If not for my vices and my bugged out desires
My year would be good just like Goodyear's tires
So I'm out pickin' pockets at the atlantic antic
And nobody wants to hear you 'cause your rhymes are damn frantic
I mix business with pleasure way too much
You know wine, and women, and song, and such
I don't get blue, I gotta mean red streak
You don't pay the band, your friends, yo that's weak
Get even like Steven like pulling a Rambo
Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago
Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago
Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago
Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago
Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago
Steal from the rich and I'm out robbing banks
Giving to the poor and I always give thanks
Becuase I got more stories that JD's got Salinger
I hold the title and you are the challenger
I've got money like Charles Dickens
I've got the girlies in the coup like the Colonel's got the chickens
And I always go out dapper like the Harry S. Truman
I'm madder than Mad's Alfred E. Neuman
{I'm never gonna let them say that I don't love you}
Well, my noggin is hoggin' all kinds of thoughts
And Adam's yoggin is Yauch and he's rockin of course
Smoke the holy chalice, got my own religion
Rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians
Like Jerry Lee Swaggert or Jerry Lee Falwell
You like Mario Andretti 'cause he always drives his car well
Vicious circle of reality since the day you were born
And we love the hot butter, on what? The popcorn
Sippin on wine and mackin'
Rockin on the stage with all the hands clappin'
Ride the wave of fate, it don't ride me holmes
{Being very proud of being MCs}
And the man upstairs I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire
Amps and crossovers, under my rear hood
Becuase the bass is bumpin from the back of my Fleetwood
They tell us what to do? Hell no
Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago
Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago
Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago
Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago
Shadrach, Mesach, Abednago

Bass
Hi-hat

Let's go get 'em

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Baby, seem like everywhere I go I see you
From your eyes I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

[Pre-Hook: Beyoncé]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

[Hook: Beyoncé]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Seeing, things that I know can't be, am I dreaming?
When I saw you walkin' past me, almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losing it

[Pre-Hook: Beyoncé]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

[Hook: Beyoncé]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu

[Verse 4: JAY-Z]
Yes

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missin' you
That I'm having Déjà Vu?

[Pre-Hook: Beyoncé]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

[Hook: Beyoncé]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Can you stay up for the weekend
And blame god for looking too old
Can find all that you stand for
Has been replaced with mountains of gold
You cannot dream yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
For next year

God I can't do this any more
Though I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door
I'm not alone

If i see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If i see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone

If i see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If i see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone
No?
If i see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If i see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone

If i see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If i see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone

[Intro]
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

[Verse 1]
Now listen to me, baby
Before I love and leave you
They call me heart breaker
I don't wanna deceive you

[Pre-Chorus]
If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I'm might tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby, from the start

[Chorus]
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart

[Verse 2]
There's no point trying to hide it
No point trying to evade it
I know I got a problem
Problem with misbehavin'

[Pre-Chorus]
If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby, from the start

[Chorus]
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart

[Intro]
(Turn the lights on)

[Verse 1]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)

[Verse 2]
I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies (Cover the skies)
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)

[Bridge]
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part
What kind of dream is this?

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you

[Intro: Jay Z snippet]
(Bring 'em out, Its hard to yell when the barrels in ya mouth) Swizzie!
(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out) Aye!
(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out) TI
(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out) Aye!

[Verse 1]
TIP coming live from the VIP, heard the night life lost life when I leave
Both the Feds and the State want to see my need
The whole city got bizzerk he got treat
Another rapper got a hit but shawty he not me
Who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed
The king back now broads don't even know how to act now
Hit the club strippers give neck 'fore I sit down
Still balling money stack taller than Shaq now
Still push a button to let the roof on the 'Lac down
I'm on the road doing shows putting my mack down
Mississippi to Philly Albuquerque to Chatt Town

[Chorus]
I got the crowd yelling (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all my hot girls yelling (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all the Dope boys yelling (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, from the back they yelling (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

[Verse 2]
Once again what other rapper hooder than this
I got rich and I'm still on some hooligan click
You be rapping bout blow I was moving the brick
You talking bout shooting out and I was doing it quick
If I hit you in the face you goin' be suing me quick
And if I catch another case I know I'm true to be missed
So I'ma keep it cool head stay out of the news
Headlines and shows other rappers its bedtime (bedtime)
It's clear to see that I'm ahead of my time
I copped a chromed out hard top Carrera to shine
I got some time, it ain't hit cause I get better wit time
Who got a flow and a live show better than mine

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Mic check 1-2 1-2, you want to beef wit the king what is you goin' do
Will you show up on the scene wit 2 guns drew
Or you and ya friend and play a little two on two
If you knew half of what I knew then you'll be hitting the deck
Got a tool and a vest I can get some respect
I'ma make it hard for a sucker to flex
Sho 'em this ain't the squad for a sucker to test
Pimp my nuts too large and we way too fresh
Work well wit Nines AK's and Techs
And quick to check a lame like a game of chess
You want beef you can bring ya best and we'll be standing

[Chorus: x2]

[Bridge: x2]
Hands, in the, air, now!
Hands, in the, air, now!
Hands hands in the in the air air now!
Hands, in the, air, now!

(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming to carry me home

Coming for to carry me, you, us on, them home
I feel weak, things get tough
Sometimes my knees can barely hold me up, yeah
I'm no fool, but it's said
That you gotta walk a mile to get outta my head

Come within, taste it up
Take a little bit and baby don't you give up
Get your life! Give a damn!
You gotta make a move to show where we can stand

Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
(Come on)

Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
(Come on)
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need

I got the time, it'll be all right, yeah
I got the time that you need (yeah)

We all weep, bleed the same
If you get the picture, leave it out of the frame, yeah
In the now, take a chance
Make a mess, and don't forget that life is a dance

Come within, taste it up
Take a little bit and baby don't you give up
Get your life! Give a damn!
You gotta make a move to show where we can stand

Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
(Come on)

Lay me down in darkness (yeah)

I got the time that you need. Come on!

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Keep your circle tight
Trust no one, nobody (nobody, nobody, no no no)
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Scarface]
Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surrounding when you hustling
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Pointing at your head, got the bread then you black out
(yeah)
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay)
They say that every doors got a day coming
It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pain to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures ain't say them words and we dry stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now, I'm still thinkin fuck that (fuck, that)
For money, niggas murder what they close to
(get this nigga)
Entire families these mother fuckin' ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepared for the payback because it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz

[Bridge: John Legend]
Cuz when you need it the most ain't no one ever around
Cold world, cold world

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unawareable
He fuck around jump of a building if you dare him to
The greats they done already killed him
Who you compare him to
Figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything, skills over politics
He don't need the accolades
As long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, No chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure
You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
He was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kids, old snitches
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches

[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]
See there's a story in my life
There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, ohh-ohh ohh
There's a story in me

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Yeah, for life
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action they grabbin' me
Take the stand, damn
Say loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told
I don't even shake his hand, I don't even crack a smile
Knew him since a child, man this game so foul
But niggas made vows to a code I never break
Ridin' in the heavy weight
Thirty-six O's in the bird, call it feather weight
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved they already ate
And I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full
If he got the money we attack him like a pitbull
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah!

[Bridge: Akon]
My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I know)
My family fucks with me
And fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way)
That's why I don't trust nobody
And I doubt you'll ever see that day
'Fore I surrender to you (surrender), surrender to you
(surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Which I will never do

[Bridge: John Legend & Anthony Hamilton]
Cause when you need it the most ain't no one ever around
(nobody's around)
Cold world (cold world), cold world (mm, yes it is, yeah)
And the ones that you keep close
Are the ones will take you down (always take you down)
Cold world (coold), a cold cold world

[Hook: Akon]
'Fore I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you
(surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
'Fore I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you
(surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Which I will never do
Ohh-ohhohhwhooa
Ohh-ohh (ohh-ohh) ohh-ohh

[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton & John Legend]
See there's a story in my life (Surrender)
There's a story in my pain (Surrender)
There's a story in my tears (Surrender)
There's a story in me
(I won't Surrender, I won't surrender, ohh no no no)
DAVID BOWIE
Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up
Climbs across his bike and he's away
Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street
Back to mother, it's another empty day

Uncle Arthur likes his mommy
Uncle Arthur still reads comics
Uncle Arthur follows Batman

Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum
Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion
Sally was the real thing, not just lust

Uncle Arthur vanished quickly
Uncle Arthur and his new bride
Uncle Arthur follows Sally
Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze
Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop
He gets his pocket money, he's well fed

Uncle Arthur past the gasworks
Uncle Arthur past the river
Uncle Arthur down the high street
Uncle Arthur follows mother
'Flow my tears', the new Police song
The slogan of peace is 'You must live'
They've got me and I'm one of them
"Cancel silence", they screamed for days
"We've been here before, we won't stay"
They can die, they can just turn off
Some vehicle moves in circles
Some people need the heroes
But I don't mind
I don't mind
Please listen to the sirens
We don't wish to be your friends
Please listen to the sirens
We won't ever call again
Mister Webb, there is no way out
Love this room, please don't fight your walls
Can't you see I'm wasting your time?
A streetcar's rusting unseen
Music hall's empty like me
But I don't care
I don't care
Please listen to the sirens
We don't wish to be your friends
Please listen to the sirens
We won't ever call again
If I could stay here for now
With someone just a bit like you, oh, no
Maybe I would dream again
Of someone just a bit like you, s'pose so
Station boys keep their hands on steel
Tube way days now seem quite unreal
It's always so close but never quite arrives
My face is like an old film, shaky
There's nothing through my window, oh my
No photo by my bedside, black, white
No image in my mirror, bye bye
Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard*
When we drink we do it right gettin' slizzard
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Gimme that Mo-Moet
Gimme that Cry-Crystal
Ladies love my style, at my table gettin wild
Get them bottles poppin, we get that drip and that drop
Now give me 2 more bottles cuz you know it dont stop
(808) Hell Yeaa
Drink it up, drink-drink it up
When sober girls around me, they be actin like they drunk
They be actin like they drunk, actin-actin like they drunk
When sober girls around me, they be actin like they drunk
Poppin bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right gettin slizzard

Now Im feelin so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now Im feelin so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now Im feelin so fly like a G6
Sippin on, sippin on sizz, Ima ma-make it fizz
Girl I keep it gangsta, poppin bottles at the crib
This is how we live, every single night
Take that bottle to the head, and let me see you fly
(808) Hell Yeaa
Drink it up, drink-drink it up
When sober girls around me, they be actin like they drunk
They be actin like they drunk, actin-actin like they drunk
When sober girls around me, they be actin like they drunk
Poppin bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right gettin slizzard

Make you put yo hands up, put yo, put yo hands up
(You can't touch this)
Its that 808 bump, make you put yo hands up
Make you put yo hands up, put yo, put yo hands up

Like a G6, Like a G6
Now Im feelin so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now Im feelin so fly like a G6

[Verse 1]
I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down
But wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around
And say

[Chorus]
That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize
It's too late, too late, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I'd take another chance
Take a fall, take a shot for you, oh, oh
I need you like a heart needs a beat
That's nothing new, yeah
I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turning blue
And you say
Sorry, like the angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

[Chorus]
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize
It's too late, oh, oh
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize

[Outro]
I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
Yeah
Hahaha
Oh you already know we gon' do
Hahahaha
Hey
Well, if you guessin' it's me, you guessed correctly
I just stay with a stallion, you would swear I was an equestrian
I hit her with that pipe, call that Nancy Kerrigan
Stay on the greenest greens, call us vegetarians
You be on that minor league, but we smoke professionally
I do my job exceptionally, on point like a decimal is
The way I ride on the beat man I be in the street it's done so effortlessly
Yeah, so these niggas can't sleep on me, there's no Inception in this bitch
I'm top chef, you top ramen, I'm top shelf
No last call, to the bartender, what you got left?
Pour it up, don't stop there, hold your cup, take a shot, yeah
All night we celebrate, cause we everywhere and you not there
Ha
All we do is pour it up
All night, drinks out
(That's how we do it)
(That's how we do it)
And all we do is light it up
All night, all you see is strange clouds
Strange clouds, strange clouds
Blue jeans, I'm faded, mindin' my own data
Smokin' on that strong, that Arnold Schwarzenegger
It's Tunechi Lee you bitch you, you hot as an igloo
Kick back on that Glock, call that Jiu Jitsu
Hello world, I'm with a yellow girl, number 2 pencil
These rappers is washed up, spin cycle, rinse you
My nigga, all day, all night, half pipe
I dive in that pussy, yeah I belly flop, I jackknife and shit
And tell my homies that I say it's a party
Got that tech for technical difficulties
I'm top dog, you top ramen, I'm top dog
Piru, gangsters, outlaws
Yeah!
(Young Mula baby)
All we do is pour it up
All night, drinks out
(That's how we do it)
(That's how we do it)
And all we do is light it up
All night, all you see is strange clouds
Strange clouds, strange clouds
Well ain't no question, yes, it's B.o.B yes definitely
Up in the studio, I got on my necessities
If you want that real shit, you made the right selection
I'm Decatur til I die, yes, I rep that definitely
They say I'm a celebrity, what the fuck's a celebrity?
I guess I must invest in the proper form of protection
And I, say it's a curse but it's emotionally a blessing
To a nigga from the hood tryna aim for the top
But I don't even need no directions
I just wake up and then I roll up the purp
But these niggas wake up on my dick
At least have some breakfast first
Cause what you hoping to accomplish I already did it bitch
All we do is pour it up
All night, drinks out
(That's how we do it)
(That's how we do it)
And all we do is light it up
All night, all you see is strange clouds
Strange clouds, strange clouds

[Verse 1]
Time after time, you been copping mine
Like, "Can I have a good time at yours tonight?"
Cause every time we try to get close
There is always something that I'm thinking about

[Pre-Chorus]
(You want me)
XXXO, XXXO
(You want me)
XXXO, XXXO
(You want me)
XXXO, XXXO
(You want me)
XXXO
(You want me)
XXXO
(You want me be)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
—ck at the door, and then we hit the floor
And all I know is you leave me wanting more
I don't let it show, but I think you know
Cause you tweeting me like Tweety Bird on your iPhone

[Pre-Chorus]
XXXO, XXXO
(You want me)
XXXO, XXXO
(You want me)
XXXO, XXXO
(You want me)
XXXO
(You want me)
XXXO
(You want me)
(You want me)
(You want me be)

[Instrumental]
GRATEFUL DEAD
Walk me out in the morning dew my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I can't walk you out in the morning dew my honey
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning
I thought I heard a baby cry today
You didn't hear no baby cry this morning
You didn't hear no baby cry today
Where have all the people gone my honey
Where have all the people gone today
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people
You never see those people anyway
I thought I heard a young man born this morning
I thought I heard a young man born today
I thought I heard a young man born this morning
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today
Walk me out in the morning dew my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew today
I'll walk you out in the morning dew my honey
I guess it doesn't really matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
I guess it doesn't matter anyway
Guess it doesn't matter anyway
Different
This one goes out to all the lovers
What can we do? We're helpless romantics
We can not help who we're attracted to
So let's all dance, and elevate each other
Dear diary, it's happenin' again
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear
She's everything I want, and it's crystal clear
Not even Marilyn Monroe
Queen Cleopatra please
Not even Joan of Arc
That don't mean nothin' to me
I just want a different girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough
Why, why do I have to lie?
Pretend, make believe or hide her?
When I love what I've described
But then again, I don't need no adjectives for this girl
Dear diary, it's happenin' again
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear
She's everything I want, and it's crystal clear
Not even Marilyn Monroe
Queen Cleopatra please
Not even Joan of Arc
That don't mean nothin' to me
I just want a different girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough
Dear diary, it's happenin' again
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear
She's everything I want, and it's crystal clear
Not even Marilyn Monroe
Queen Cleopatra please
Not even Joan of Arc
That don't mean nothin' to me
I just want a different girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough
What's wrong with that?
What's wrong with that? Yeah
What's wrong with that?
In honor of the groove and all who's surrendered to it
We say thank you, and we take it back
We're so hard, I was so hard that they can't chew
Then my lucky star, I guess you came from behind the moon
I put my arms around her, and I promise not to abuse you
Since now I found you, why the hell would I want to lose you?
Dear diary, it's happenin' again
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear
She's everything I want, and it's crystal clear
Not even Marilyn Monroe
Queen Cleopatra please
Not even Joan of Arc
That don't mean nothin' to me
I just want a different girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough
Dear diary, it's happenin' again
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear
She's everything I want, and it's crystal clear
Not even Marilyn Monroe
Queen Cleopatra please
Not even Joan of Arc
That don't mean nothin' to me
I just want a different girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough
It's a worldwide, no we know you can't come back
No we know you can't come back
Cause you look so right, cause you look so right x 2
Now come here, stop, drop it, pause
Now come here, stop, drop it, pause
Oh, look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like oh
Look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like

Look, I got what you need to get you hooked
I steal all your heart I'm a crook
One Friday night, I'm sorry, I'm booked
Brooke, Maria? Pause

Now come here, stop, drop it, pause
Now come here, stop, drop it, pause
Oh, look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like oh
Look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like
Amiga would you like to play?
We love to see what you stay
And if you say ok, we will play night and day
I'm such a dirty dawg, my teeth will unsnap your bra
But for now baby just pause

Now come here, stop, drop, pause
Now come here, stop, drop, pause
Oh, look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like oh
Look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like

Mammy know what is sometime, mammy know what is sometime
She got what I like, what I like
Mammy know what is sometime, mammy know what is sometime
She got what I like, what I like
Mammy know what is sometime, mammy know what is sometime
She got what I like, what I like, pause

Now come here, stop, drop it, pause
Now come here, stop, drop it, pause
Oh, look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like oh
Look at that girl, she's like ah
Look at that girl, she's like pause

[Verse 1]
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

[Verse 2]
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

[Outro]
Didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know
The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumpin and the joint began to swing
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing
Lets rock, everybody, lets rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin to the jailhouse rock
Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowin on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the purple gang
Lets rock, everybody, lets rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin to the jailhouse rock
Number forty-seven said to number three
You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the jailhouse rock with me
Lets rock, everybody, lets rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin to the jailhouse rock
The sad sack was a sittin on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weepin all alone
The warden said, hey, buddy, don't you be no square
If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair
Lets rock, everybody, lets rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin to the jailhouse rock
Shifty Henry said to bugs, for heavens sake
No ones lookin, now's our chance to make a break
Bugsy turned to shifty and he said, nix nix
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks
Lets rock, everybody, lets rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin to the jailhouse rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin to the jailhouse rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin to the jailhouse rock
Chorus:
Just like Janet
We waited a while
Lemme hear you
Say My Name
Like Destiny's Child
Get romantic
Put on some Babyface
Or some Brandy
What's The 4-1-1
Mary J. Blige
Can i hear
That Usher song
Please
Just one more time
You remind me
Like R. Kelly
Of my favorite R&B

I'm in the mood for
Something hot
Something sexy
With the groove on
Go through the records
I'll tell you
What you needa play
I wanna relax my mind
It's been a long day
Turn it up, get me open
With the right song
Play that track on repeat
Let's bring it on
Tonight i wanna feel you
The music sounds
Good with you
(Chorus)
Go put the cd on
Break out
The Peaches And Cream
You know it turns me on
Baby
You're Making Me High
Just like the Toni song
That's got me
Feenin like Marvin
Let's Get It On
Just like Jodeci
Just like SWV
Just like some TLC
Come closer
Let me touch you
The music's so sweet
With you

(Chorus)
I wanna lay
Next to you, ohh
We'll listen
To our favorite R&B songs
Ooh
Can we get right to it
I wanna hear it, won't you
Play my love songs
Play Hot Like Fire
Play anything
Tat you got with Mariah
Ne-Yo's
Still got me
Listening
Because of you
Baby
I'll show you
Play some Chris Brown
And let it flow
I'm kinda ready
To slow it down
And play some Joe
You know the one
Can we break it down
I've waited so long
Put it on

(Chorus 2x)

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
'Cuz I know I don't understand
Just how your love your doing no one else can
(Chorus - Beyonce)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's

(Verse 2 - Beyonce)
When I talk to my friends so quietly
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress
The way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how the love your doing no one else can

(Chorus - Beyonce)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (oh crazy)

Check it, let's go
Young Hov y'all know when the flow is loco
Young B and the R-O-C, uh oh, (oh)
Ol' G, big homie, the one and only
Stick bony, but the pocket is fat like Tony, Soprano, (oh

The ROC handle like Van Axel
I shake phoneys man, You can't get next to
The genuine article I go I do not sing though
I sling though, If anything I bling yo

A star like Ringo, roll like?
Crazy bring ya whole set
Jay Z in the range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure them out they like hey is he insane, (oh
No)
Yes sir I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur, of chinchilla
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
Been dealing with chain smokers
But how you think I got the name Hova?
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
I been realer the game's over
(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)
Fall back young, ever since the label changed over

To platinum the game's been wrap, One!
(Bridge - Beyonce)
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby I don't care

And baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cuz baby you got me, you got me, so crazy baby

(Chorus - Beyonce)

[Intro]
This next song is called, Cum on My Lip

[Verse 1]
I'm fed up eating just, eating just like a kid
I'm fed up eating just, eating just like a kid
And I'm caught up living with all the things I did
I did
Ohh

[Verse 2]
Hard to reach, feeling just, feeling just like a kid
Hard to reach, feeling just, feeling just like a kid
And I'm caught up living with all the things I did

Turn Off The Lights
Hey what's happening baby
I'm the one who needs no introduction
Cuz I'm the world class doctor
The master of seduction
I can heal all your ills
And give you extreme delight
But only if you allow me
To turn off the lights
Before you turn off the lights
Let's get one thing understood
If you plan to make love to me
You've got to do it good
Cuz I'm a hell of a woman
And for me it takes a hell of man
So don't you dare turn off the lights
Unless this you understand
Yes, my name is Shakespeare
A world class poet
So kick back and relax yourself baby
Let me pour you a glass of Moet
Darkness will be your blessing
As I bring you extreme delight
But first you must allow me, Shakespeare
To turn off the lights.... click
Before you turn off the lights
Let's get one thing understood
If you plan to make love to me
You've got to do it good
Cuz I'm a hell of a woman
And for me it takes a hell of man
So don't you dare turn off the lights
Unless this you understand
Don't turn off the lights
Unless you'll love me right
You hear what I'm saying
Cuz boy I'm not playing
Don't turn off the light
Unless you plan on staying
And of course, I'm DJ Yella
The mixologist of the crew
And I would just love
To mix bodies with you
Your lips I would kiss
Your body I would hold tight
But only if you allow me
Check this out
To turn off the lights
Before you turn off the lights
Let's get one thing understood
If you plan to make love to me
You've got to do it good
Cuz I'm a hell of a woman
And for me it takes a hell of man
So don't you dare turn off the lights
Unless this you understand
Like a meloncholy dancer for you I'd dance
With nothing but a g-string on my hip
Your kiss and touch I'd slowly collect
For they'd be my tip
There's parts of your body I'd slowly kiss
And others I'd gently bite
But first, you must allow me, Lonzo
To turn off all the lights
Before you turn off the lights
Let's get one thing understood
If you plan to make love to me
You've got to do it good
Cuz I'm a hell of a woman
And for me it takes a hell of man
So don't you dare turn off the lights
Unless this you understand
Don't turn off the lights
Unless you'll love me right
You hear what I'm saying
Cuz boy I'm not playing
Don't turn off the light
Unless you plan on staying
Sta-a-a-ying
Down at the station early in the morning
See the little pufferbellies all in a row
Some folks go to work and others take vacations
One took Melinda to Cal-i-for-ni-o
Oh don't go Melinda, please don't go
You didn't see the teacake I brung you from the fair
I've been working on the railroad all the livelong day
I've been working on the railroad just to pass the time away
Can't you hear the whistle blowing, rise up so early in the morn
Can't you hear the captain shouting, Dinah blow your horn
Dinah won't you blow, Dinah won't you blow, Dinah won't you blow your horn
Dinah won't you blow, Dinah won't you blow, Dinah won't you blow your horn
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah, someone's in the kitchen I know
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah, strumming on that old banjo
And singing fee fi fiddle-e-i-o, fee fi fiddle-de-i-o-o-o, fee fi fiddle-de-i-o strumming on that old banjo
Some go to work, and others on vacation
One of'em took Melinda to cal-i-for-ni-a
I don't fuck with nobody, about me
I don't fuck with nobody, about me
I don't fuck with nobody, about me
I don't fuck with nobody, about me
I don't fuck with nobody...

These bitches love T-Raww
Hatin,' need machine guns
All these niggas they broke boys
And I push a Rolls Royce
Niggas they don't like me
I heard niggas they don't like me
Man these bitches love T-Raww
Only trust my Nina
King shit with my feet up
Kill a nigga with my song, but
Niggas they don't like me
I heard niggas they don't like me
Man these bitches love T-Raww

Ridin' 'round no plates
Schemin' tryin' to get paid
Lookin' for a fuck date
Men lie, women lie
But not the numbers I make
Load up that Wild Boy
Call it MGK
Mind gone, don't fuck with me
Countin' dorms in the Middle East
38, Silence of the Lambs
Hello Clarice
My life need a DVD
Bags of money like the Money Team
Dress bitches in all black
You could call them BET
These hoes in competition
Competing for a seat in VIP
These niggas claimin' they poppin' bottles
They just holdin' that sparkle thing
Wrist on, I had a dream
Martin Luther I must've seen
Mixtape, mix ya body with tape
That's what that green'll bring
These bitches love T-Raww
Hatin,' need machine guns
All these niggas they broke boys
And I push a Rolls Royce
Niggas they don't like me
I heard niggas they don't like me
Man these bitches love T-Raww
Only trust my Nina
King shit with my feet up
Kill a nigga with my song, but
Niggas they don't like me
I heard niggas they don't like me
Man these bitches love T-Raww

Off season, no time to play
Night time, my time of day
I hustle hard like Ace and Wayne
Two shifts, I'mma need a raise
Carpool, stay in your lane
I'm blowin' up, that's propane
These hoes want my last name
No sitcom, this the House of Pain
No I don't fuck with nobody like celibates
I ride alone, I die alone
She give me head, that's Tylenol
No dialogue, she play her part
My life a movie, no script at all
I darn say that I did it all, I did it all, so...
These bitches love T-Raww
Hatin,' need machine guns
All these niggas they broke boys
And I push a Rolls Royce
Niggas they don't like me
I heard niggas they don't like me
Man these bitches love T-Raww
Only trust my Nina
King shit with my feet up
Kill a nigga with my song, but
Niggas they don't like me
I heard niggas they don't like me
Man these bitches love T-Raww

Wakin up around eleven now we rollin like it's Cali
Got a fine dark skin like kesha up in belly
Ah really I ain't ready commitment is just to heavy

She ain't flippin through my celly
We're both grown, lower your tone I'm just kiddin

Hope you ain't feelin different 'cause most of them girls was digits
But you I play my cards right royal flush finish (oh)
Gotta chick that love me no attitude she hug me
Li-lick me down and rub me lo-loyal when she for me
Too many homie owe me push em to the side
'Cause they ain't down to ride

[Chorus:]
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it
I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
Tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up

I told her stop it, drop it, in a polo t and I rock it
You see the girl I'm with is chocolate
And her friend is on that vodka
And they drunk,rough sexing
I get head like a .. pour slow
, I lean back and turn slow
So cold, my mike, might need a fur coat
I love love and I hate hate
Stand on my word I be 6 8
, out of mixtape, die real, shit straight

Benz, biz paid
Been , since the 10th grade
, louies on, , other louies tied up
And I never fuck with you
You'll never have ne tied up
I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
Tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up X 2

I tell drop it, yeah, how about it?
Shawty burning up like a pound of Wasabi
Magic city, know how to drop it
Sliding down the pole, then she pop it
She's incredible, so delicious
Wanna take a bite, she's the sweetest , kisses
Drop it low, then bring it back up
Model after model, tell her bring another model
We in this baby you already know
Straight legs bend over touch your toes
You wanna get away, I'ma let you drive this rocket
5,4,3,2, 1 drop it

I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
Tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up X 2
5,4,3,2, 1 drop it

She start dropping, she role
Stripping out on that pole, , bezn coop
When I'm pulling up, full as fuck
Eating right and there's more to come
This ain't fair, 4-1
, I beat it up I smash them
I cross over, I pass them
I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
Tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up X 2
5,4,3,2, 1 drop it
I got mo' class than most of 'em, ran wit' the best of 'em
Forgave the less of 'em and blazed at the rest of 'em
What can I say? Cal-i-for-ni-A
Where niggas die everyday over some shit they say
Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a Beretta, nigga, I'm down for whateva
I roll wit' my shit off safety - for niggas that been hatin' me lately
And the bitches that wanna break me
If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath
Bumpin' gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash
Cause from Eazy-E, to D.O.C., to D.P.G
Started from that S.O.B., D.R.E
Like Dub-C I'm rich rollin', pistol holdin'
Pockets swoll nigga, that's how I'm rollin'
Put the flame to the killer nigga
Worldwide homicide mob figure in the building, for real
I'm hittin' switches, makin' bitches eat bitches
See me grab my dick everytime I pose for pictures
I own acres, floor seats watchin' The Lakers
I'm cool with eses who got AK's in cases
Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the heezos
1 - Niggas play this in their Rovers Jeeps and Regals
2 - Bitches play this in their Benzes Jeeps and Geos

Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the heezos
1 - Niggas play this in their Rovers Jeeps and Regals
2 - Bitches play this in their Benzes Jeeps and Geos

I bust a Mr. Toughy, slash a Smoothy Doobie
Crash and flex on Tuesday's, harassin' hoes at movies
Passin' by with uzis - and who you aimin' at?
That shady bitch and that bitch nigga that was claimin' that
Rat-tat-tat-tat {*automatic gunfire and screaming*}
{*more screaming as tires peel out*}
I don't sympathize for wack hoes and wimpy guys
You got to recognize Hitman is a enterprise
Cali pride, born to ride and South Centralized
The Henny got me energized - smoke the guys
Tryin' to focus on mines - poke they eyes out
I'm L.A.'s loc'est - hope they don't have to find out the hard way
Like snitch niggas in the pen that get
Hit when the guards look the other way
We hittin' HARD, Hitman and Dre
You playin' games, I suggest you know the rules
We puttin' guns to fools, make you run yo' jewels
Take yo' honey and cruise to the snootiest snooze, Cabos
Pop coochie 'til the nut oozes, you shouldn't fuck wit' crews
That's sick, Aftermath cause we rule shit
I'm Big Hit, don't confuse me wit' no other by the flow, motherfucker
Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the heezos
1 - Niggas play this in their Rovers Jeeps and Regals
2 - Bitches play this in their Benzes Jeeps and Geos

Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the heezos
1 - Niggas play this in their Rovers Jeeps and Regals
2 - Bitches play this in their Benzes Jeeps and Geos

You look like AC Green, bitch don't call here anymore
With feet like Ben Vereen, bitch dont call here anymore!

[Verse 1]
When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe...

[Chorus]
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

[Verse 2]
When you say that you love them and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (you can have it all back)
Flowers, cards and candy
( I do it just cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her: "I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world"
Ladies say: "I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can"

[Pre-Chorus]
See, I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

[Chorus]
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

[Bridge: Electric Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else...
Paroles de la chanson Chariots Of Fire :
House of fire
House of fire, yeah
Let's build a house of fire, baby
Not one of wood or stone
Walk through my door of desire, baby
Come on in and make it your home
Don't need a window to watch you, baby
Don't need no roof overhead
Don't need no key to unlock ya, baby
I'll use my lovin' instead
I won't tire
Take me higher
Building a house of fire, baby
Buildin' it with our love
We are buildin' a house of fire every time we touch
House of fire
House of fire
We ain't gotta pay rent now, baby
No landlord to throw us out
I want to play in your garden, baby
When you want it give me a shout
I won't tire
Take me higher
Building a house of fire, baby
Buildin' it with our love
We are building a house of fire every time we touch
We are building this house together, baby
Standing on solid ground
We are building a house of fire
That you can't tear down
Brick by brick the flames get higher
Build it strong with our desire
Building a house of fire, baby
Building it with our love
We are building a house of fire every time we touch
We are building this house together, baby
Standing on solid ground
We are building a house of fire
That you can't tear down
Building a house of fire, baby
Building it with our love
We are building a house of fire every time we touch
We are building this house together, baby
Standing on solid ground
We are building a house of fire
That you can't tear down

I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a flirt

Soon as I see her walk up in the club (I'm a flirt)
Winkin' her eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs (I'm a
Flirt)
Sometimes when I'm with my chick all alone (I'm a flirt)
And when she's wit' her man lookin' at me, damn right (I'm a

Then, don't bring her around me because (I'm a flirt)

Now swear to tell the truth and the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimpin' like I supposed to
Rollin' like I supposed to, shinin' like I supposed to
In the club, fuckin' wit' honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand when a nigga bring his girlfriend to the
Club
Freakin' all on the floor wit' his girlfriend in the club
And wonder why all these playas tryna holla at her
Just soon as you go to the bathroom nigga I'mma holla at her

Flirt)
Aye homie if you ain't gettin' no money
You better keep her away from me ya dig

Well if you love ya girl, and wanna keep ya girl
Don't be walkin up and askin' me to meet your girl
Cuz I'm well enough flirt when I speak to a girl
She winked her eyes on the slide, I sent you girl
Better treat your girl right cuz another man will
Better eat ya girl like another man will
Cuz you leave your wife, and I see ya wife
That be for real, how long you think that's finna be ya wife
Well I'm livin' the life, you just gettin' it right
Your old lady look at me cuz you ain't hittin' it right
She probably used to like you cuz you the bitter type
That's until I came along and put some dick in her life
Wanna see how that ass look with a dick in her life
I noticed she was checkin' me and diggin' the ice
And if I get that tonight better hit that twice
I can even make her mine if I hit that right
Ya know, smack that thang, sit that right
Up on the dresser yeah that's right
Pullin' on her hair like we gettin' in a fight
Yeah I know it's kinda tight but it'll suit her just right
So if ya girl sexy, and she test me
Don't be upset G cuz you might catch me
Tryna to catch a glance up her skirt, put the Mclaren in
Reverse
Then if I see her and I like her then I'mma flirt
Lets Go Y'all!

When I (uh), when I (uh), when I (uh)
When I pull up to the club, all the shawties be like (Damn
28's)
Then I be like girl you know just who I (am don't hate)
See I done fell n luv wit' a stripper y'all
All I do is flirt with her and I get them draws
And I don't need no help I got it down (down pact)
Teddy Pain was born to flirt now you can't down (down that)

That's why they call me Teddy Penderaz(doun)

Flirt)
Sometimes when I'm with my chick all alone (I'm a flirt)
And when she's wit' her man lookin' at me, damn right (I'm a

[Verse 1]
We all love this city, we all love this city
We all love this city, we all love this city
I think the name alone says it all (New York)
United we stand, divided we fall
Either you lead, you follow, or get up out...
Basically we got it broken down to a silence
Everybody from Brooklyn put your hands in the air
And all my boogie down broads,big blue screen yeah
We know Queens in here
And the money making Manhattans over here by HA
Staten Island stand up
Three colors gottem shook right out that truck
Four rings, the thumbs gettin' anxious
Four words, "all in ____ ____"
B-G-L-E
Super hot definition bustin' out your TV
So go hard, I go home
We put an end to your run like zone
Get it yeeah
The Big Apple going all in
New York City stand tall we never fall in
One nation, Red White and Blue
We goin' all in five four three two!

[Chorus]
We're all in, we're all in
We're all in, we're all in
We're all in, we're all in
We all love this city
(Money making now)
We all love this city
(Put me down)
We all love this city
(Brooklyn stay hard)
We all love this city
And you can see the skyline from the side line
No point to try to read between the fine line
Its right in front of your face, and if that ain't enough
We could put you on the field and give you a taste
Determination, Perseverance, if you ain't speaking that language then we ain't tryna hear it
That adrenalin settin' in
This a tight circle and you ain't gettin' in
The Big Apple going all in
New York City stand tall we never fall in
One nation, Red White and Blue
We goin' all in five four three two!

[Chorus]
We're all in, we're all in
We're all in, we're all in

If you from the Big Apple I know you're with me
Put you're hands up, the same ones that built this city
The Big Apple going all in
New York City stand tall we never fall in
One nation, Red White and Blue
We goin' all in five four three two!

[Chorus]
We're all in, we're all in
We're all in, we're all in

Park your whip leave the trash on the side
Cause once entering these gates youll never be alive
Again, again please proceed to the right
You must be excited, the worlds best surprise
And soon to be captured by your eyes
And no capturing, leave your cameras behind
The only thing you need is your body and you mind
You can drive to the entrance but I prefer to fly

Grab your ticket and get in the line
You got pees follow me
And heres a map to the rides
Im colorblind when it comes to the night
But for now take this locating device
Eye for an eye get ready for the time, of your life
Its gonna be mighty nice
Im instructor outta luck-tor and dont ask why
I almost forgot, man goodbye

Id like to welcome you, all of you, to Tygas world. Where there is lots of things to do, and people to see. You might see a flying dachshund or you might see popcorn. Rot. Just playin. Enjoy your stay, boys and girls, at Tygas World!
You like what you see so far, right?
Awesome
Characters, Merry-Go-Rounds, jaws droppin
Mind boggling
Kids jogging, Magic Carpets
Many choices, but not a option
Here you will spend the rest of your life
Im Just Joking
Just Kidding, this will be home to many
For many centuries
Check out the goldfishes
Theyre all dead, but still swimmin

Oh You think youre so fearless?
Ill take you on another venture
So Im more scarier than your dentist
Its called Grimace
A purple like substance used for licking spirits
Some can say it also chose the heron
Explosion fire off into nighttime
Getting closer
And I think were getting closer
I didn't notice
Im losin focus
Blood loosin
Blurry Motion
Im movin
Oh shit
Now now now calm down calm down, We can't have any accidents in the park here. But uhm I hope youre having a good time, cause I no I am. But uhm we haven't even gotten to the main attraction yet, boys and girls. Read your map, and welcome. To Tygas World!
You scream! You scream!
Youre making up a scene
You won't feel nothing
Pretend its just a dream
Dream that youre safe and sound to sleep
Cause this needle here is gonna put you to sleep
And Im not being funny
Im just following the money
Boss man says Im just working for him
Youre soon gonna meet him
Just dont be afraid as his facial features look like a pizza
Freddy Krueger, the movie, have you seen it?
Well this is sorta the same the doctor dreamin
And might try escaping
You wouldve got away if it wasn't for this nine inch tazer
The torture isnt over
Theres more
More!

And more
Now give me your soul
And enjoy your stay at Tygas World!

Haha I wanna thank you for leaving your soul tonight
And um you guys have been a great audience and I have been a great host
My name is Tyga, man. Well Tyga Alien
Haha and um I wanna thank you boys and girls once again
Come back, To Tygas World
Oh little town of bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in they dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight
For christ is born of mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth
How silently, how silently, the wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of his heaven
No ear may hear his coming, but in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive him still, the dear christ enters in
Oh holy child of bethlehem, descend to us we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in, be born in us today
We hear the christmas angels, the great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us, our lord emanuel
Jimmy's just a bum
Who wants to hold on to the past
He tries to be a tough guy
But dumb kids come in last
He says he'll win her heart
His love life is a mess
He calls his Dream Girl destiny
And she calls him obsessed

He says he'll take my girl away
But i don't really care
And i don't worry
I know that he wants her
But it's plain to see
That jimmy's dreamgirl
She's in love with me

Jimmy calls his Dream Girl
On the phone real late at night
He says that they were meant to be
And she lets him know she's mine
He offers her his haircut
His nice shoes
A b-ball game
All i've got is my guitar
This band and half a brain
He says he'll take my girl away
But i don't really care
And i don't worry
I know that he wants her
But it's plain to see
That jimmy's dreamgirl
She's in love with me

He says he'll take my girl away
But i don't really care
And i don't worry
I know that he wants her
But it's plain to see
That jimmy's dreamgirl
She's in love with me

[Intro: Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda]
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun

[Verse 1: Killer Reese One]
I am King Reese One, I do not back down
See the scars on my head? Boy, I earn that crown
I've been stabbed, I've been shot, I've been stomped the fuck out
I lost pieces of my soul representing this house
Ask anybody that can walk through y'all with your folks
They tell you I go gorilla, "that nigga is no joke"
So win, lose, or draw, this is where I stand
And if I got to see my end, I'm going out like the man

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun, no!
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun

[Verse 2: Killer Reese One]
I think I hear 'em coming
Grab my burners out the basement, get my baby and my woman
Send them out the back, put on my bulletproof
Tell the homies we got action and I head up to the roof
I will not go alive, I ain't cut like that
I am Killer Tony, son, I go nuts like that
Wildman, Shaka Zulu, ridin' for the cause
And God bless the one that is second the draw

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun, no!
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun, no!
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun, no!
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun, no!
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
Told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea
And when it was time for her to leave she spread her wings high over me
And said I shall return tomorrow
And I said fly on my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet, sweet angel
Tomorrow I shall have you by my side
Sure enough this mornin' came to me
Silver wings silhouetted against the golden rose of today's sunrise
And the angel she bent down and told me
You'll never have to worry about this place just wipe your weepin' eyes
I'll take you where you've never been, you can fly
I looked around and I thought
Fly on my little angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'll be by your side
I got my wings to fly
Haha
Give me all, give me all, give me all attention baby
I got to tell you a little something about yourself
You're wonderful, flawless, ooh you're a sexy lady
But you walk around here like you wanna be someone else
Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine
(fine, so fine)
Ooooooooooohhhhhhhhh
Oh girl I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine(mine, oh mine)
Treasure, that is what you are
Honey you're my golden star
I know you could make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you
Oh oooooh
Pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl you should be smiling
A girl like you should never look so blue
You're everything I see in my dreams
I wouldn't say that to you if it wasn't true
Oooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhh
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine
(fine, so fine)
Ooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh
Oh girl I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine(mine, oh mine)
Treasure, that is what you are
Honey you're my golden star
I know you could make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you
You are my treasure, you are my treasure
You are my treasure, yeah, you you you, you are
You are my treasure, you are my treasure
You are my treasure, yeah, you you you, you are
Treasure, that is what you are
Honey you're my golden star
I know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you
Intro:
Yeah, whattup, this is Dr. Dre
The party's goin on
Thank God it's Friday

["Buck buck buck buck booyaka shan!" - KRS One" rpt 4X]

Chorus:
Keep their headz ringin (ding ding dong, ring-gading ding ding dong)
Repeat 2X
Hey you, sittin over there
Say what?
You better get up out of your chair
That's right
And work your body down
Yeahhh...
No time to funk around, cause we gon....
Funk, you, right on up
So get up, get a move on, and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party I go for your neck so call me Blackula
As I drain a n****'s jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains so don't complain
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill
Keepin it real, enables me to make another meal
Still, n****z run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple, so call me Clearasil
I wipe n****z off the face of the Earth since birth
I been a bad n****, now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a Stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music flows like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that n**** that keeps the hoes' panties wet
The mic gets smoked, once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin
The motherf***in D-R-E, will keep their
Motherf***in headz ringin
Chorus
One-two for the crew, three-fo' for the dough
Five for the hoe, six-seven-eight for Death Row
Mad n****z about to feel the full effect of intellect
So I can collect respect, plus a check
Now I fin' to, get into to, my mental will take care of this business I need
To attend to cuz my rent's due
And this rap s***'s my meal ticket
So you goddamn right I'm gonna kick it, or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, runnin n****z over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I kick plenty of a**, so call me an astronaut
As I blast past another n****'s a** that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, n****z know, it's time to take a hike
Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin
The motherf***in D-R-E, will keep their motherf***in headz ringin
Chorus
Debonair with flair, I scare wear and tear
Without a care, runnin s*** as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician, no competition
Sendin all opposition to see a mortician
I'm up front, never in the back drop
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat top
Your rhyme sounds like you bought em at Stop N Go
Dre came to wax you so, just call me Mop N Glow
Many tried to, but just can't rock with
I'm 6-1, 225, a pure chocolate
Your chances of jackin me are slim, G
Cause I rock from summer til Santa comes down the chimney
Ho ho ho, and so, as I continue to flow
Cause yo, I'm just a fly negro
So, check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherf***in D-R-E will keep their motherf***in headz ringin
Chorus
Yeah, yeah, and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah, yeah, and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison, but I'll hold on tight

Yeah, yeah, and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah, yeah, and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison, but I'll hold on tight
Yeah, yeah, and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah, yeah, and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison, but I'll hold on tight

Sometimes life, it takes you by the hair
Pulls you down before you know it
It's gone and you're dead again
I've been in places and I won't pretend
That I'd make it out just to fall on my head
Wake up strange and take the walk downstairs
Hit the pawn up on the corner and pay for my rent
You know that I could not believe my own truth
Just show 'em what I choose, got nothing to lose, oh
Yeah, yeah, and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah, yeah, and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison, but I'll hold on tight
Yeah, yeah, and it's okay
I tie my hands up to a chair so I don't fall that way
Yeah, yeah, and I'm alright
I took a sip of something poison, but I'll hold on tight

Ooh-whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh
Ooh-whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh, ooh whoo-ooh-ooh
Hold on tight

[Verse 1]
Please don't get answers from eyes
You know that mine can't lie quite as well as yours
Just let the spare moment flow
Rounding steps as I go through the open doors

[Verse 2]
Please don't deflate from a sigh
I'd hold still every time but I start to shake
I wander around for days
Wondering what I'll say when they want the truth

[Chorus]
You will never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at the start
The depth of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favours for me (Ahh)

[Refrain]
You will never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at the start
The depth of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favours for me (No)

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
(You know)
(You know)
(You will never know)
(You know)
(You know)
(Oh)
I ain't gonna marry in the fall
I ain't gonna marry in the spring
For I'm in love with a pretty little girl
Who wears a diamond ring

And I'm just a country boy
Money have I none
But I've got silver in the stars
And gold in the morning sun
And gold in the morning sun

I'm never gonna kiss the ruby lips
Of the prettiest girl in town
I'm never gonna ask her if she'd marry me
For I know she'd turn me down

'Cause I'm just a country boy
Money have I none
But I've got silver in the stars
And gold in the morning sun
And gold in the morning sun
I never could afford a store bought ring
With a sparkling diamond stone
All I could afford was a loving heart
The only one I own

I'm just a country boy
Money have I none
But I've got silver in the stars
And gold in the morning sun
And gold in the morning sun
You know I love you baby from A to Z
Something about you keep on worried me
Sometimes you love me and sometimes you don't
Sometime you will and sometime you won't
Because you're so swell baby when you're well
So swell baby when you're well
So swell when you're well
But you just stay at sick so long

Keep on connivin' and jivin' too
True love will never smile on you
You walked the floor just sit and cry
Pull out your hair and wonder why
Because you're so swell baby when you're well
So swell mama when you're well
So swell baby when you're well
But you just stay at sick so long
So swell baby when you're well
You so swell mama when you're well
So swell baby when you're well
But you just stay at sick so long
Yeah you're so swell baby when you're well
You build me up then you let me down
The way you treat me is the talk of the town
If you love me like you said you do
How come you treat me like you do do do
Because you're so swell baby when you're well
So swell mama when you're well
So swell baby when you're well
But you just stay at sick so long
Don't think it's what you're afraid of
Come in you know what's been made up
Hold you tight, words have a new sound
Reading the signs that just seep out
You've got to leave it

"Don't you go evade me now
Come see what you've done"

Each of your reasons has broken
Call it off once you have spoken
Filled to the top then split open
Repeating over and over
Now you have to leave it

"Don't you go evade me now
Come see what you've done
I've been thinking lately how
All these feelings won"
"If they ever drop the bomb," you said
"I'll find you in the flames"
But now we act like people
Who don't know each other's names
Well, sometimes it makes me sad, you know
Sometimes it makes me smile
'Cause you know how the game goes, honey
We all eat it once in awhile
Scissors cut, paper covers rock
Breaks the shining scissor
You hurt me, I hurt her
And she goes and he will miss her
Now I look around at people
Playing children's games
And I wonder if you're still thinking
You might find me somewhere in the flames
Scissors cut, paper covers rock
Breaks the shining scissor
You hurt me, I hurt her
And she goes and we will miss her
Scissors cut, paper covers rock
Breaks the shining scissor
You hurt me, I hurt her
And she, she goes and he will miss her
Scissors cut, paper covers rock
Breaks the shining scissor
You hurt me, I hurt her
And she goes and he will miss her
Scissors cut, paper covers rock
Breaks the shining scissor

[Spoken Intro]

You find yourself trying to do my dance
Maybe cause you love me (Uh, you do it well)

I would act all nonchalant infront of an audience
Like if you was just another shorty I put the naughty on
But uh, truth be told you do me for a loop, this Hov
I'm too old to be frontin when I'm feeling Denzel
And you acting like you ain't appealing but you are
Stuting like you ain't my only girl but you are (I was just frontin)
I'm ready to stop when you are

[Chorus]
I know that I'm carrying on, nevermind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin (you know I want ya babe)

But you know I want ya (you should stop frontin babe)

At my place baby, at my place
Merrymaking, drug taking
At my place baby, at my place

Well, I've wandered around after a hour of work
And I'm waiting to meet her for weeks
The ghost of a girlfriend appear in my room
I can still smell her perfume in my sheets
But that's not her in my bed though she's out on the town
And I don't want anyone to see
There's a tattoo of my name on her body but honestly
The man holding her hand isn't me
Oh honey, how could you regret me
When you can't even forget me?
Babe, it's okay to say that you love me
'Cause I think of you all night long
Still think of you all night long
Oh, okay, say that you love me
I think of you all night long
Still thinking of you all night long
I thought that once you had one, you had every woman
Until I lost this legendary woman
Now I'm sure that they don't make' em like her anymore
So please, baby, please lover
Let's find a way to forgive each other
I've gotten around ever since you've been gone
Without you I'm still alone
Oh, how can you regret me
When you know you can't forget me?
It's okay to say that you love me
'Cause I think of you all night long
Still think of you all night long
Oh it's okay, say that you love me, okay
I think of you all night long
Still thinking of you all night long
I make mistakes, I'm only human
And I am not ashamed to say
That you are the one
Babe, it's okay to say that you love me
'Cause I think of you all night long
Still think of you all night long
Babe, it's okay to say that you love me
'Cause I think of you all night long
Still think of you all night long
And it's okay, all night long
Say that you love me all night long
Ooh, say you love me
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beatin' heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding my self, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding my self, and I
Didn't know I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding my self, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding my self, and I
Didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
Grrrrrrrr...

Chorus to fade

[Intro: Douglas Williams]
You changed my life
You changed my life
Sing

[Verse 1: Yolanda Adams, Douglas Williams, Both]
So many nights I wondered
About this day I pondered
When you just stepped right in
I didn't know what to do
All I knew is I needed you and you rescued me
And you changed my life
Honoring this union
We were joined and now we are one
I love you forever, I'm gonna leave you never
Every day more and more is wonderful who I adore
I'm not the same since you came

[Chorus: Yolanda Adams, Douglas Williams, Both]
(You changed my life)
Love went into my heart you came, yeah
(You changed my life)
You came into my life
I'm no longer the same

[Verse 2: Douglas Williams]
Now that I have you with me all of my life beside me
I'm free indeed
You said you'd never leave me lonely
If I made you my one and only love
And now you are my life

[Pre-Chorus: Yolanda Adams, Douglas Williams, Both]
It's in you I live and to you my life I give
You can make me what you want
Full of glory ('Cause I wanna be)
Every day's a brighter day
'Cause you're with me all the way
I'm not the same since you came, since you came
Oh

[Chorus: Yolanda Adams, Douglas Williams]
(You changed my life)
Oh, you changed my life (You changed my life)
(You changed my life)
When into my heart you came, you
(You changed my life)
You changed my life
Oh, oh, oh, I'll never be the same

[Bridge: Yolanda Adams, Douglas Williams]
Today is the first day of the rest of my life
To be more of what you want me to be
And I promise to cherish what God has bestowed upon me
'Cause you

[Outro: Yolanda Adams, Douglas Williams, Both]
(You changed my life)
You changed my life
And I'll never be the same
No, no, no, no
(You changed my life)
I'm so glad you decided to bring your whole life to me
(You changed my life)
So glad you came into my life
(You changed my life)
You came and you changed me
You came and you changed me
You came and you changed me
You came and you changed me
(You changed my life)
Honor this union, Lord
(You changed my life)
I'll never be lonely again
Paroles de la chanson I Live For You :
You

Marvin Gaye

You, you I see in my mirror in the mornin'

Instead of seein' me

I see you, I see your face

And inside me is a growing need for your embrace

In the light of day, though our faces meet

Someone there might see someone else speak

Till the dark of night, while the moon is new

While we whisper words of love in our secret rendezvous
Somethin's wrong I know, girl I love you so

Yes I need you, I need you baby

Oh you, my sweetest joy

You can afford the best of life

I'm just a heartbreakin' boy

Oh you've given your love to me

Girl, I can't let you hurt yourself by being seen with me

We're worlds apart, so close yet very far

So we must hide the love we're feelin' in our hearts

We meet in shadows, your friends must never know

That we are lovers, darlin'

Alhough it hurts me so, for your sake no one must see

The press of love you're givin' me
But you know, I need you baby

One day I'll make the break, my love will start to shine

I can tell the world that you are mine, all mine

Till then we must go on the way we have before

And never let it show without each other's souls

I'll never one-way track 'cause there's no turnin' back

Oh I need you baby

[Répéter verse 1 and fade)
Everybody's lookin' for love, oh, oh
Ain't that the reason you're at this club, oh, oh
You ain't gon' find it dancing with him, no oh
I got a better solution for you, girl, oh, oh
Just leave with me now
Say the word and we'll go
I'll be your teacher; I'll show you the ropes
You'll see a side of love you've never known
I can see it going down, going down
In my head, I see you all over me
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy
In my head, you'll be screamin', ooooh
In my head, it's goin' down
In my head, it's goin' down
Some dudes know all the right things to say eh eh
When it comes down to it, it's all just game yeah
Instead of talkin', let me demonstrate, yeah
Get down to business and skip foreplay
Ay yeah
Just leave with me now
Say the word and we'll go (we can go)
I'll be your teacher; I'll show you the ropes (show you the ropes)
You'll see a side of love you've never known

In my head, you fu' fill my fantasy
In my head, you'll be screamin' ooooh
In my head, it's goin' down

In my head, it's goin' down

In my head
You should never try to get too personal
You wanna step to me?
Rock with me now

I love it when they try to get intimate
Even though they know I really ain't into it
-You're not into it?
I'm not into it (3X)
I already know the game and I've been through it

I love it when they try to get scandalous
Even though they know they really can't handle it
-They can't handle it?
They can't handle it (3X)
Try and take me out to dinner, I'll cancel it
Get your head to the ground
Shake it all around a dirty sound
Put your knees into your face
And see if you can race real slow

Oh it's a slowdive, when you die slow
Oh it's a low jive, do the slowdive

Get your head to the ground
Shake it all around a dirty sound
Put your knees into your face
And see if you can race real slow

And now you jump like a hound
Emit a howling sound
Dig those limbs into the floor
And holler out for more

Get your head to the ground
Shake it all around a dirty sound
Put your knees into your face
And see if you can race real slow
Oh it's a slowdive, when you die slow
Oh it's a low jive, do the slowdive

And you revel in the dips
When your backbone slips
Taking honeysuckle sips
From your rolling hips
It shifts and it shifts

Oh it's a low jive when you come around
It's a low jive to the slowdive
When you come alive
It's a low jive to the slowdive

Slowdive, slowdive
Do the slowdive
Slowdive, slowdive
Let's get it on!!

Once again it's the Dark-Man, nigga
Hit or spark a nigga
Break apart a nigga
But the dog is bigger, under stress
So unless
You're wanting to bless
To the chest
These slugs from his liver rest REST!
Or the pump'll put a hurt on a nigga
DUMB SEX, motherfucker feeding dirt on a nigga
My hands stay dirty, 'cause I play dirty the mob way
You don't know? Fuck it, find out the hard way
A nigga's job is never done
I handle my business how it come
And there's never been a one on one
Nor has there been a problem
I dissolve them
I'm like salt, lock it up
Hate to fall but never wreck his car
And it's my fault, keep niggas on point ducking down
Niggas like you need to get busted, you fucking clown
I extort to support my peeps
And hold down the fort, never get caught 'cause I creeps
NIGGA!

Which way to go
Should I play that low for what I did the other day?
They on their way to float, got me striking this random
I can't stand 'em fake ass niggas wanting to be the Phantom
Looking over my shoulder, cause it's colder than it was
And start shorty, because I'm a little older than cuz
And the buzz
From the saw with the chain
To your brain
Will turn that BIG NIGGA to a fucking stain
That pain from the dirt makes the hurt go away for a minute
But I'm gon' die by it cause I'm like knee deep in it
And you motherfuckers wonder why I start shit?
'Cause when you look in my face, you see that hard shit!
'Cause I done been to hell and back
I ain't wit selling crack
I'd rather rob a nigga, leave him wit a shell up in his back
On the real, just to show proof
I hit the G.W.B., and blow the whole roof
Off the toll booth, bitch ass nigga!
Get it on the floor
Get it get it on the floor (WHAT?!)

When I crawl, leave a nigga sprawled out after I spoke him
I'll slit his throat, dick in the mud, and let his blood
Choke him
Up north, niggas get the pick stuck up in em
And in the streets, bitches get the dick stuck up in em
My M.O. is man-slaughter, kid
'Cause, on the reals, I done wet up more motherfuckers than
Water did
Slid, 'cause I got to slide when the dirt is done
A homicide, but they want me on the Murder One
But as long as I got my gun, I'm aight
Stay outta sight
While it's light
And then come out at night
To make moves again
Stomp and bruise again
I know I'm going to hell, 'cause I choose to sin
All my motherfucking life, I been the Devil's advocate
Now, niggas never even knew the devil had a kid
But he does; and when you hear the buzz of the chainsaw
You'll know why I'll split your motherfucking brains for!
Get it on the floor
Get it get it on the floor (WHAT?!)
Get it on the floor
Get it get it on the floor (WHAT?!)
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go (WHAT?!)
You don't wanna party then your ass gotta go (C'MON!)

If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl, you’d never be alone
And I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go, I’d never let you go
Never let you go, never let you go
Never let you go, never let you go
Never let you go, never let you go
Never let you go, never let you go

[Verse]
If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go
I can take you places you ain’t never been before
Baby, take a chance, or you’ll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I’d really like to blow
Swag swag swag, on you
Chillin' by the fire while we eating fondue
I dunno about me, but I know about you
So say hello to falsetto in three, two, swag

[Chorus]
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl, you’d never be alone

Awakened by the daylight, man starts his busy day
Eight hours occupy his mind 'cause the bills gotta be paid
Will he take a moment and give thanks before he's on his way?
Everybody wanna go to heaven, don't nobody wanna pray

Man has made everything, this we can't deny
Invisible highways in the sky so safely his iron bird can fly
Hooray for man for he has finally conquered the moon
But when asked when will the fighting end, he only answers...soon

Man won't rest until events are being had
When you think about it, it's really kinda sad
Man is no longer in need of a friend
With no love for his fellow man, this could only mean the end
What's up Jack?
This goes out, uh, huh, it goes out, uh, huh
To all the Biters, huh? What?
Timbaland got something to say ya'll, check him out
This is the lil' man speaking right now, yo, Timbaland, kick it
If it's money to be made, I guess I'm the printer
If it's ice to be rocked, I guess I'm the winner
You know my crew, Ginuwine, not the pretender
One in a million like Aaliyah, burn like Gonorrhea, what?
I beat the beater, snares everywhere
Cris' like the diamonds in the watch on my wrist
Audiences growing like a newborn
You must be on some new and improved
Lyrically I murder tracks, put two in a crew
Tell me who wanna mo', catch me in the studio, what? Doing a do
Give me 10 minutes, I'll hook you up with joint that's mean
From New York, VA to Cali, all points in between
Timbo, I even bowed it down in NO
And every corner that I flow, you know I get it on
Timbo, I even bowed it down in NO
And every corner that I flow, I get it on
Can you get it on?
(Um, hmm)
Are ya hands up?
(Um, hmm)
Where all the playa haters at?

Hip to the hop when I came in the do'
(What?)
Missy went platinum then I came in some mo'
(What?)
Aaliyah, then Ginuwine, Mag and two O's
(Uh, huh)
Outside production on Coko and Total
Fugitive wanna buy the man for real
Got warrrents beats and program to kill
Timbaland nigga and I'm ill
Don't believe me? Take the back of your hand and feel
I'm burnin' up, yo, can't stop my flow
I'm burnin' up, ya'll can't stop my dough
I'm burnin' up, up top and down south, they know
When it come to these beats I don't play, yo, I get it on

Now she's gon' point 'em out, check it
I come sweeter than a two seater Benz
Have your pockets wide open, have you spendin' on friends
It never ends, expensive indeed
Without the C's lavish habits love the carats, nigga's with mad weaves
Spendin' money ain't nuthin', nigga's who style frontin'
And then pretend ya gettin' old
Nigga, we let you know, diamond district
Platinum Rolex's with the chips in it
Money to burn, nigga when will you learn
It's automatic, now I realize I gotta have
Lifestyles of the rich, that fly assed bitch
There's a track to be ripped, I got the hot shit
Check the whip, I'm banging from my land to my six
Had you screamin' at the show saying Bassey's a hit
I got the gift and nigga's know I'm ready for this
Eyes closed, lips sealed and prepare for the kiss
And I told ya'll we won't miss, what?
Did she get it on?
(Um, hmm)
Are ya hands up?
(Um, hmm)
Where all the playa haters at?

Now point 'em out

Wendy...don't believe a word he says
I can't picture you with him
His future looks awful dim
Oh, Wendy...Wendy left me alone

Wendy...I wouldn't hurt you like that...
No, no, no
I thought we had our love down pat...
Guess I was wrong
The farthest thing from my mind
Was the day that I'd wake up to find
My Wendy...Wendy left me alone

[Verse 1]
Jezebel wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth
She probably had less than every one of us
But when she knew how to walk she knew
How to bring the house down
Can't blame her for her beauty
She wins with her hands down
Jezebel, what a belle
Looks like a princess in her new dress
How did you get that
Do you really want to know, she said
It would seem she's on her way
It's more, more than just a dream
She put on her stockings and shoes
Had nothing to lose - she said it was worth it

[Chorus]
Reach for the top, she said
And the sun is gonna shine
Every winter was a war, she said
I want to get what's mine

[Verse 2]
Jezebel, Jezebel
Won't try to deny where she came from
You can see it in her pride
And the raven in her eyes
Try and show her a better way
She'll say you don't know what you've been missing
And by the time she blinks you know she won't be listening

[Chorus]
Reach for the top, she said
And the sun is gonna shine
Every winter was a war, she said
I want to get what's mine
I want to get what's mine

[Outro]
She said I want to get what's mine
I want to get what's mine
I want to get what's mine
AVICII
Looking up
There's always sky
Rest your head
I'll take you high

We won't fade into darkness
Won't let you fade into darkness

Why worry now
You'll be safe
Hold my hand
Just in case

And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
This world can seem
Cold and grey
But you and I
Are here today

And we won't fade into darkness
No we won't fade into darkness

Nothing to fear
But fear itself
We'll be OK
Just keep the faith

And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

Whoa
Whoa (fade into darkness)
Whoa
Whoa (fade into darkness)

Whoa
And we won't fade into darkness (whoa)
Fade into darkness (whoa)
No we won't fade into darkness (whoa)
Fade into darkness (whoa)
Whoa
Fade into darkness
Paroles de la chanson No Woman, No Cry :
No, woman, no cry;
No, woman, no cry;
No, woman, no cry;
No, woman, no cry

Said - said - said: I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba - obaserving the 'ypocrites
As they would mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past;
So dry your tears, I seh

No, woman, no cry;
No, woman, no cry
'Ere, little darlin', don't shed no tears:
No, woman, no cry

Said - said - said: I remember when-a we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire lights
As it was logwood burnin' through the nights
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
Of which I'll share with you;
My feet is my only carriage
So I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone, I mean:
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's gonna be all right!
I said, everything's gonna be all right-a!
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's gonna be all right, now!
Everything's gonna be all right!
So, woman, no cry;
No - no, woman - woman, no cry
Woman, little sister, don't shed no tears;
No, woman, no cry

[Guitar solo]
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire lights
As it was logwood burnin' through the nights
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
Of which I'll share with you;
My feet is my only carriage
So I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone:

No, woman, no cry;
No, woman, no cry
Woman, little darlin', say don't shed no tears;
No, woman, no cry

Eh! (Little darlin', don't shed no tears!
No, woman, no cry
Little sister, don't shed no tears!
No, woman, no cry.)

[Verse 1]
Oh, seems there's no way out
Of a mind so fixed on it's doubts
Oh, when the walls are all torn down
Mind is free without reason to frown

[Pre-Chorus]
Lost my company, all alone again
Felt so lonely, looked forward to the end

[Verse 2]
Oh, wore a five ton mask while it dragged me closer to death
Seen it all insane, till I put on a fresh set of frames

[Pre-Chorus]
I knew practically nothing
And I was a wasted man too scared to really feel
But with a grasp onto something
It's just a bliss to finally glimpse something so real
Oh, I know... I been there
I was looking for nothing but a good time

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Oh, seems there's no way out
Of a mind so fixed on its doubts
Oh, when I'm almost there
I don't know if I feel like I care

[Pre-Chorus]
I knew practically nothing
I was a wasted man, too scared to really feel
But with a grasp onto something
It's such a bliss to finally glimpse something so real
Oh, I know... I been there
I was looking for nothing but a good time

[Outro]
I'll do what you want to do for you
Hey girl
I'll do what you want to do for you
Girl
I'll do what you want to do for you
Hey girl
I'll do what you want to do
Hey girl
I'll do what you want to do for you
Adam lives in theory tryin' to turn stone into bread
Masquerading like he's got it figured out
Cut off from the sunshine, only smart in his own head
Leaving his descendants to hope and doubt
Left to his devices, those worthless sacrifices
Praying to the altar of his self
Making pilgrimages thinking he's religious
Like he's got all the light, and no one else
He takes the unsuspected
'Cuz he knows they're not connected
And he shows them how to be just as he is, virtually real
And commercially appeal, to the lust of all the people where he lives
Eve was so naive, blinded by the pride and greed
Wanting to be intellectual
Drifting from the way, she got turned down one day
And now she thinks that she's bisexual
Caught up in emotion, burning up in her devotion
To the king of exploitation in the field
She handed him her virtue, 'cuz he told, "I won't hurt you"
So she lay with him to see how good it feels
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now?
Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now?
Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?
Now after the sensation, and the empty fornication
She brought infection home into her bed
Quickly multiplying, now the three of them are dyin'
By the poison she perceived to be good
Now Eve and her husband, are perverted in their judgment
'Cuz everything appeared to be the same
They entertain suggestions, next time just use protection
Desiring to cover up their shame
But much to their demise, poor decision closed their eyes
To the very antidote of their dilemma
Burning in their lust, both of them adulterous
Destroying the original agenda
Praying to the sky, in order to maintain a lie
They exhausted every possible conclusion
They can't even entertain, or the solution in a brain
Or filled with vain, information and pollution
Hiding from the truth, he provided an excuse
To explain away his desperate situation
When confronted, blamed his wife, giving birth to carnal life
Refusing to acknowledge what he'd done
And now, if we can agree with who created us to be
Who says we're guilty, everyone before His eyes
Making no exceptions, since the day of our conception
Predisposed to hating truth, and loving lies
Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now?
Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now?
Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?
Stop walking in pride, let the thief be crucified
Unlearn everything you know and let Him teach you
Line upon line, and precept upon precept
Say goodbye to this decaying social system
He wants to know, how far we're willing to go?
If we love Him like we say we do, He'll try us
Just you don't regress, or slip into hopelessness
Once He's satisfied, His love, He won't deny us
And then He'll tell us what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
And then He'll tell us, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
I'm telling you, telling you, I'm telling you
I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
He's gonna tell us, tell us, tell us
Ooh! Yeah
Give me your, give me your, give me your attention, baby
I gotta tell you a little somethin' about yourself
You're wonderful, flawless, ooh, you a sexy lady
But you walk around here like you wanna be someone else
Ooh, whoa
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine 

[(fine, so fine)]
Ooh, whoa
Oh girl, I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine 

[(mine, oh mine)]
Treasure, that is what you are
Honey, you're my golden star
You think you could make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure, ooh ooh ooh
Pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl, you should be smiling
A girl like you should never look so blue
You're everything I see in my dreams
I wouldn't say that to you if it wasn't true
Ooh, whoa
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine 

[(fine, so fine)]
Ooh, whoa
Oh girl, I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine 

[(mine, oh mine)]
Treasure, that is what you are
Honey, you're my golden star
You think you could make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure, ooh ooh ooh
You are my treasure, you are my treasure
You are my treasure, yeah, you, you, you, you are
You are my treasure, you are my treasure
You are my treasure, yeah, you, you, you, you are
Treasure, that is what you are
Honey, you're my golden star
You think you could make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure, ooh ooh ooh
When love leaves & breaks your heart
Your dreams simply fall apart
You see a world sad & blue
So unfamiliar to you
You look for lips that you once kissed
But they're lost in mist
Oh oh oh oh it's funny
How nothing seems quite so clear
When you're looking through a tear
The face in the crowd
You see is her face
All seems to fade in the shade of her glory
And you wait for the chance
To catch another glance
But she really wasn't there
Her words linger in your ear
Goodbye is all that you can hear
It couldn't happen to you
But all at once love is through
It's funny
How nothing seems clear
When you're looking through a tear
Aw aw
Aw aw
Aw aw
Bandz!

[Verso 1]
Niggas don't like when you fly as fuck
But I'm fly as fuck
When they see my face they be lighting up, up
They be lookin til their hair gets stuck
When they comin out their socks and such
Who'd do it how I do it hah? Nobody does
Can I have swag without being stopped for it?
I board 1st class, ye ain't even lookin at my boarding pass
Til ya find out who I was
Now you want a photograph, a photograph
Haters on my back, like some shoulder pads
Nigga finna snap like a quarterback
Yea they know I'm fly but they hope I crash, hope I crash

[Ponte]

[Verso 2]
Fly, fly, that nigga so fly
Y'all niggas so weak
Y'all niggas just blah
They don't understand
Cuz you're just so blind
I do this for the days
When I had just enough to get by
Now I got more than enough to get by
But I got more than enough on my mind
Just lost a loved one the other night
Just got home and another one died
I don't even have the tears to cry
Tryna find gold in a diamond mine
Cuz diamonds are harder and harder to find
Ain't no one left for me to call
Ain't no more numbers on my line
Tell me how high must I climb
You fuck niggas stay on line
But I don't really have the time
I don't really have the time

[Ponte]
If anybody else got something to say

[Intro]
Tyga, are you ashamed of the things you've done?
I havnt done im ashamed of
All the people youve hurt?
Hmmm
So you dont feel any remorse?
Remorse for what?, you people have done everything
In the world to me, doesnt that give me eaqual right?
I can do anything I want to to you people at anytime
I want to because thats what you've done to me
If you spit in my face and smack me in the mouth and
Throw me in solitarty confinement for nothing what
Do you thinks gonna happpen when I get out of here?
So you dont feel guilty at all?
Theres no need to feel guilty
I havnt done anything im ashamed of maybe i havnt done
Enough I might be ashamed of that for not doing enough
For not giving enough, for not being more perceptive
For not being aware enough
For not understanding, for eh being stupid
Maybe I should of killed four five hundred people then
I would of felt better, then i would of felt like i
Really offerd society something
You know if I wanted to kill somebody I'd kick this
. and beat you to death with it and I wouldn't feel a thing
Uh!

[Verse]
I'm outraged and underage Tyga straight out the cage
The faceplate badge on the louis suitcase
Boom base when the sound spray, bang!
Every hurse killer reherse no sounds stay
I milk hoes like a cows taste
Chandoliers in my living space
Symbolising the good life half fake, the hoes half bake
All at my shows with the smiley face big bank cheque
Little bank in this rat race
Per say coby swag im past ... tryna get twenty four eggs with the ice lace
I'm gettin the same cake the president make beyond
Bad things never care what the mass say never what
The maths says, them chips really ain't safe in the
Safe, bam bam a flintsone a problem man across the
Street make you hold your own hand, feel fear nigga
This close to your ear nigga
Flowin this ... when the ribbon hit ya
Hard like the liquor hit ya whats the diference grey goose duck duck shoot
In the same minite, a lace minites
No gang bang niggers, just a gang of money with a gang
Of niggers, gang of strippers
Gang of grippers, when them gang niggers start trippin
Sounds ridiculos street symphony
But i dont party with the enemy just a lot of love
Hate niggers staring at me
These jelousy arrows just aiming at me
Im'a take three then vers em all on the beat
Black beast the most beautiful thing in me mixed with
Some asian came in freash off a space ship
Sunny ass chain on my bright days slave shit
Shit im outaged and underage bitch!
I'm outaged and underaged
I'm outaged and underage bitch!
You know, when you're in love and your lover leaves you
And you've got nobody, the lonely hours over here
Sittin' home and thinkin', you say

Distant lover, lover
Oh, so many miles away
Oh, heaven knows that I long for you
Every night, every night and sometimes I yearn through the day

Distant lover, oh lover
You should think about me, say a prayer for me
Please, please, baby
Think about me sometime, think about me yeah
Here in misery, misery

As I reminisce
Oh, baby, through our joyful summer together
The promises we made of the daily letter
Then all of a sudden everything seemed to explode
Now I gaze out my window, sugar, down the lonesome road
Distant lover, oh, sugar
How can you treat my heart so mean and cruel
Don't you know, sugar
That every moment that I spent with you
I treasured it like it was a precious jewel
Oh, baby

Lord, have mercy

Oh baby, don't go
Please come back, baby
Something I wanna say
When you left you took all of me with you
Now, Lord
I wonder do you wanna hear me scream and plead
Please, please, please, come back home girl
Please, baby, come back home

Oh baby, don't go
Please come back, baby
Oh, something I wanna say
When you left to go away
No other do I want, do you wanna have me plead and scream
Please, please, oh please, baby
Come back home, girl
Oh baby, come back
Oh, oh
If ever you got rain in your heart
Someone has hurt you, and torn you apart
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me?

Run to me whenever you're lonely (to love me)
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then, you need someone older
So darling, you run to me

Run to me whenever you're lonely (to love me)
Run to me if you need a shoulder
Now and then you need someone older
So darling, you run to me

And now, I've found that the world is round
And of course it rains everyday
And now, I've found that the world is round
And of course it rains everyday
And now, I've found that the world is round
And of course it rains everyday
The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone, baby
The thrill is gone away
You know you done me wrong, baby
And you'll be sorry someday

The thrill is gone
It's gone away from me
The thrill is gone, baby
The thrill is gone away from me
Although, I'll still live on
But so lonely I'll be

The thrill is gone
It's gone away for good
All the thrill is gone
Baby, it's gone away for good
Someday I know I'll be open-armed baby
Just like I know, I know I should

You know, I'm free, free now, baby
I'm free from your spell
Oh, free, free, free now, baby
I'm free from your spell
And now that it's all over
All that I can do is wish you well

Uh-uh, see, I'm with that girl
Deb is like "Bob - is that yo' girl? "
I was like "Uhh, I'm not really sure! "
"But I'll hit you when I'm done with her"

[Verse 1]
I said I didn’t need you, baby
I said I’d get along
I thought I could make it without you, baby
But I guess I’m not that strong

[Chorus]
And I didn’t know I could miss you so
Until you were gone

[Verse 2]
I said I’d get over you, baby
I said I’d be alright
Just, just when I start remembering
That all the hurt comes back in the night

[Chorus]
And I didn’t know I could miss you so
Until you were gone

[Bridge]
I tried to stay away 'cause I knew I couldn’t win
But here I am, and I’m back again
I tried to find someone else to take your place
But every time I close my eyes, I can see in, see in your face

[Verse 3]
Oh, oh, oh, I said I’d forget you
'Cause I really thought, I really thought that I could
Oh, oh, I thought I could stop loving you
I tried but it didn’t do no good

[Chorus]
And I didn’t know I could miss you so
Until you were gone

[Outro]
I said I’d get over you, baby
I said I’d be alright
But, oh, oh, just when I start remembering
It comes back in the night
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I thought I could
Oh baby

[Verse 1]
Who's gonna pay attention
To the redheads of the world
Who's gonna call them up at night
When they're naked and alone

And who's gonna kiss the brown haired girls
Who's gonna wipe away their tears
And what about the black haired girls
Who's gonna whisper filthy things into their ears

[Chorus]
'Cause anyone who ever had a brain
Wouldn't stand out in the rain
Or keep it up for very long
Just to prove somebody wrong

And anyone who ever had a heart
Or sang a lonesome song
Would sell their little souls
Just to make it with the blonde

[Verse 2]
It's just unearned admiration
Are you sick of all the stares
You don't need to hide yourself away
You only need to dye your hair

But it won't do you any good
'Cause pretty soon your roots will be showing
And anytime you try to leave the room
They'll ask you just where the hell
Do you think you're going

[Chorus]
'Cause anyone who ever had a brain
Wouldn't stand out in the rain
Or keep it up for very long
Just to prove somebody wrong

And anyone who ever had a heart
Or sang a lonesome song
Would sell their little souls
Just to make it with the blonde
Ozay... Wiz... Roll up ladies and gentleman... Spitta

You think you got the bond cause I rolled you a joint?
I smoke with all mine, baby girl whats your point?
Don't front
You in the back of a long line
Trying to get in cause only members inside
Trees get twisted up like fingers and gang signs
Purple kushes broke my fall
I fell from a grape vine
Super high, from the free throw line
I'm Drexler status, glide, ducking espionage
Many jelous eyes scrutinize the rise
But the jets in the house like the curtains and the blinds
It hurts to see me shine that's why they frowning all the time
In they internet videos digital see befores
Angry orangutan I'm arranging my sneakers
I'm the action on the court
You the gum stuck to the bleachers
I think I'm Paul Pierce, I think I'm Rondo
High off the headband you dying on that hydro
Cuz we are... we are... super hiiiigh
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

I thought of this fresh off a bong rip
My bitch next to me, getting undressed for me
Running bath water playing her favorite songs while I get another one lit
Don't usually smoke at all but you say tonight you'll take a hit that's understood
From the smell and by what I payed, you know its good
Them niggas with me, they from the hood
Now we throw parties in the sky, I'm on the 42nd floor now thats super high
Champagne, more paper planes than you could fly
Them young niggas fail soon as they try
When the paparazzi flash
I be countin all this cash
Plotin a million and how to build a mountain out of hash, come on...

All these cars, all these stars, all around me (super high)
Put your eyes... to the sky, that's where you'll find meee (ooh ooh ooh)

Cuz we are... we are... super hiiiigh
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

Rozay!!

I'm gettin money no Illuminati
My pain never went in vein it's all over my body
Hit the spliff in my Mr. Bugatti
Kick it with my little homies I'm Mr. Miyagi
I gotta buy my niggas each a pound
Tweakin up,??, pass the reefer around
Spittin only lethal rounds, speakers beatin down
Not talkin much as when I say my niggas eatin now
Promoter gave me 40 thou, I think we even now
Pina colada papers, smoke the garden of eden now
Taylor gang is what we bleed about, jet setters in places you only read about
And now everywhere I go
It's so strong they ask me where I get my smoke
Bitches don't gotta guess they know
I keep one rolled up, we can do what ever you want
Smokin pina colada papers baby girl we don't fuck with the blunts... unless I'm with the boss

If your lookin for me you could find me in the Guiness book
Only fly bitches ride with the boss take a look, I'm super fly...
I'm super high, you get yours, I'm getting mine

Super hiiiigh... super hiiiigh

Ay yo waitress, I need another bottle of that Rozay, I need another bottle of that Rozay
I need another bottle of that Rozay, just order, just order, another bottle of that... rozay

Wiz... spitta... uhh

[Verse 1]
I think it's funny how you could find yourself alone
With someone else in an ideal situation
Without a shred of good intentions between you
Much less a decent explanation
I couldn't tell you why she summoned me
Sometimes you get lucky
And they think that you were someone else
I can't remember what she said
Was she trying to tell me something
Or talking to herself?

[Chorus]
Go upstairs don't close the door
Why don't you give her what she's asking for?
Spill the drink onto the bed
That's just between her and her friend

[Verse 2]
But it made it hard to sleep
'Til her head felt even worse
And I hope that she felt miserable
When it was time to go to work
Her and her friend
Just did it as revenge
So any excess pain you feel
Isn't any consequence
But don't feel bad
'Cause you didn't stand a chance
You can make a hasty exit
That's how they handle it in France
Little consolation
Even if you always knew it
So any nasty things I say
Are purely therapeutic

[Chorus]
Go upstairs don't close the door
Why don't you give her what she's asking for?
Spill the drink onto the bed
That's just between her and her friend
Close the door, leave on the light
And kiss her for a little while
The liquor soaked into the sheets
She said, "It's getting late, you'd better leave"

[Outro]
I'm not budging until you tell me why
Please, go
Not until you look me straight in the eye and tell me why
Go away and never come back again
Go away, please, go away
Go away, please, go away...
Ooh, I remember when this road was my own
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
And ooh, I lost the feeling but I'm tryin'a hold on
I thought the end of love is what made you strong
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore!

When there's no getting through, I won't hold back
I will throw down everything in life, I know now
I've been laying on the floor, sweeping on the ground
I would give up everything in life, I'd know how!

'Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up, I'd look up to the sky
I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you
Give it to you!

Ooh, when the moon was shining bright before mornin'
I made a deal with the stars to keep holdin'
Shining bright to come and bring me back home
The lights in my eyes, they disappeared
Visions in my mind about to keep me from fear
I won't let it hold me down, the other way around
I don't want the words 'til I can't make a sound
'Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up, I'd look up into the sky
I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you
Give it to you!

Can't hold back, reaching out
I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
Between us, I told you that
I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it, I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it, I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it, I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it to you, give it to you!

I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you
Give it to you!

I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you
Give it to you!

[Snoop Dogg]
Hehe, yeah that's that shit right there
Is this that shit that make a nigga just
It remind me of, matter of fact I'ma tell y'all
I wasn't gonna share this but I'll share it witch'all
Check this out

I slid up in a party where some suckers was at
Out of bounds slipping fucking with this hood rat
My homeboy told me that the bitch wasn't shit
But I didn't give a fuck cuz this twin a Crip
The first young nigga with a baseball cap
Tried to hit a nigga up until he seen how we strut
I'm like 'Nigga, take two steps back
Now lower your voice before you get pimp slapped'
I know you seen me on your MTV raps
Way back in the days when I was with Fab' Five Freddy
I told you then, I told you now, boy I stay ready
Don't sweat it, we'll get him and then met him
Talk shit for a minute then deal with him
Hail Mary, call Makavelli to come and save your ass
Cuz I'ma put my Chucks up in it so quick and so fast
You use some act-right like LaBetty
And let you know that I'm the king of this motherfucking city
Like Frank White, Nino Brown, John Gotti, Tony Soprano
Joey Banana and the great Tony Montana
All of 'em mixed in one fixed to done
I like playing six-to-one
This is fun, shooting my guns, counting my funds
And walking on you bitch niggas that run
I'm from

[Chorus - Snoop Dogg]
213 the gangsta clicc
21 motherfucking 3 nigga
All we do is the gangsta shit
Gangsta shit, biatch

Haha and you know it, nigga
All we do is the gangsta shit
Y'all know what's happening
Haha

[Warren G]
I shoot 'em up, I bang bang
Or we can duke 'em up but you know you can't hang
Still from the Beach, still a g thang
213 in the house and you know how we came
We came to party homie, so back up
Plus up in the club, y'all don't have a body
I bust guns, you bust guns
Difference is my bullets probably touch the sun
Want some? Come and get it
On your marks, get set, blah!
That's coming with it
They won't stop, they'll get it, you don't get it
It don't stop, still dont love bitches
My G-niggas, holler if ya hear me (Gangstas!)
Speak it loud and clearly
If you feel me raise your cups (East Side, Long Beach)
Blaze it up
And we from

[Chorus]

[Nate Dogg]
You can call me Lil' Meeno
Crazy motherfucker plus I'm Texas C-Notes
His finger on the trigger but it way too slow
You didn't see me coming so we missing his dome
213 and we gone
You can call me Nate King Cole
Smooth motherfucker when it come to these hoes
All damn dimes up in every area codes
Gangsta shit, yep and all the hoes know
When they go rolling in the stretch Navigator
We gon' get it baby girl now or later
She said she wanted to play so I played her
Made a promise to pay, but never paid her
Ain't that a hater
It's just she's a goddamn ho
And all of my niggas know
They knowin' since '94
Wherever we go, she gon' go

[Chorus]
I saw when you arrived looking like a supermodel
Your ass from the side looks just like a coke bottle
I love the way you ride put that thing on full throttle
So get, get get get, get up on the saddle
I wanna see you move like they're moving in Jamaica
Pretend that I'm a dinner she can be my saltshaker
You ain't tryin to hide it, girl you're a troublemaker
And i'm a troublemaker
I throw my hands up if you believe in me now
I keep my hands up and do it all for the now
Sing out
Sexy little mama, you screaming nice to meet you
Can i be in your classroom and be your private teacher
If I bring out my camera will you be in my feature
'Cause we're gonna do some things, hope your daddy ain't no preacher
I wanna see you move like they're moving in Jamaica
Pretend that I'm a dinner she can be my saltshaker
You ain't tryin to hide it, girl you're a troublemaker
And i'm a troublemaker
I throw my hands up if you believe in me now
I keep my hands up and do it all for the now
Sing out
I love the way you dance, oh it makes me crazy
I wanna see you move so just let it go baby
I feel like we can do this if you wanna go with it
Let's take it to the top, pu-pu-push it to the limit
Take it to the top, pu-pu-push it to the limit
I throw my hands up if you believe in me now
I keep my hands up and do it all for the now
Sing out

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
There is freedom within, there is freedom without
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road while you're traveling with me

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Ariana Grande]
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
And we know they won't win

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me, suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the T.V. page

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Ariana Grande]
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
And we know they won't win

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus & Ariana Grande]
Are you a mouse or a bear or a..? Um
Whatever you are it's probably the cutest mouse/bear thing I've ever seen
I'm a unicorn if you can't tell
You're the cutest unicorn in the world
That's fine, we can just go to riff on it
Sorry I was fucking up, I was drifting sorry
I was flirting sorry, sorry I was flirting, sorry
Alright everybody, sorry I'll fuck off, here we go, I'm sorry here

[Verse 3: Miley Cyrus & Ariana Grande]
Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Ariana Grande]
Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
And we know they won't win
Hey now, hey now, don't dream
Hey now, hey now, world, you're an angel Ariana Grande
Hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now
This is what you do
This is what you do
This is what you do

Chorus
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationshipwith you
This is what you do
Think about her and the things that come along with
You make me
You make me wanna leave the one Im with
Start a new realtionship with you
This is what you do
Think about her and the things that come along with
You make me
You make me

(Verse1)
Before anything came between us
You were like my bestfriend
The one I used to run to when me and my
Girl was having problems (thats right)
You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I come home at night and lay my head down
Sll I seem to think about is you
And how you make me wanna
(Chorus
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her and the things that come along with
You make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new realtionship with you
This is what you do
Think about her and the things that come along with
You make me
You make me

(Verse2)
Now what's bad
Is your'e the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should've been you
What's sad is I love her but I'm falling for you
What should I do
Should I
Tell my baby bye-bye
Should I
Do exactly what I feel inside
Cause I
I don't wanna go
Don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together
Chorus
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (oh baby)
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her and the things that come along with
You make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (oh baby)
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her and the things that come along with
You make me
You make me

(Verse 3)
At this point
The situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her but I
Gotta let her go
And if she may not understand it
Why all of this is going on
I tried
I tried to fight it but the feelings just to strong

You make me wanna wanna
You make me wanna
Chorus
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her and the things that come along with
You make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her and the things that come along with
You make me
You make me

Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine

I'm affraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, my darling and so is love

Your words don't mean what they used to me
They were once inspired, now they're just routine

I'm affraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, my darling and so is love

I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci and get myself a clown's disguise
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci with tears in my eyes
You look the same
You're a lot the same
But my heart says "No, no, you're not the same"

I'm affraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love
So is love, the masquerade is over
So is love
Ooh, come on
Ooh yeah
Well I tried to tell you so (Yes, I did)
But I guess you didn't know
As the saddest story goes
Baby, now I got the flow
Cause I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again
And show you that I'm with

You lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me
Yes, I tried
Yes, I tried

You lied to me
Even though you know I'd die for you
You lied to me
Yes, I cried
Yes, I cried

That I'm back to run the show
'Cause what you did you know was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
So baby, listen carefully
While I sing my comeback song

You lied to me
'Cause she said she'd never turn on me
You lied to me
But you did
But you did
You lied to me
All this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me
But I do
But I do, do, do

Couple milli on the neck like I’m tryna get indicted

I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
Oh Lord!
Sittin' on them M’s, now shit is gettin' realer
Brick of diesel got my hood looking like it's Thrilla'
Buying all these foreign's, I be in and out the dealer
Just to let my niggas hold on when they rollin', it could kill 'em
And these suckas, I don’t feel 'em
I don’t even see 'em
I’m a die fly, rest in Peace Aaliyah
Half my dawgz dead, the rest of them is here
If all your jewels fake, how the fuck we gon' believe ya
Said I did it for my dawgz, did it for my dawgz
Everybody ridin' till you sit 'em in the morgue
Started with a Bonnie now I’m sittin' in a Porsche
With the shooters right behind me
Shit, you looking at a boss
Rose gold rolie on my wrist, flawless
Hundred bottles send 'em to the VIP, ballin’
Basketball leather in the Benz, Spalding
Y'all niggas talking, fuck is y'all retarded?
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
Oh Lord!
I did it for my dawgz
Did it for them niggas with a vision like a boss
Did it for them niggas in the kitchen with the salt
Now I’m in that white thing, 500 horses for my niggas in the coffin
But got bikes in my hand and a drop head Rolly
Staring at the ceiling when I wake up in the morning
My dawg doing life, try to see him ‘fore he hit the coffin’
Play with my paper, run up in your offices
It’s the 'o twelve Ice Cube nigga with the Raider hat
A maniac nigga, where the paper at
Highway to life, need a hundred mill exit
50 on the wrist, hundred on the necklace, Montana!
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz
Oh Lord!
Yo, watch who you drinking with
Watch who you smoking with
1.7 in my safe when I open it
If I put 7 in ya face, will I open it
And I know tomorrow ain't promised but I hope it is
Love to get acquainted with you
Stay and tear the jail up
Did it for my dawgz so I had to put the bails up
Get them thangs off so I haven’t put the scales up
Treat you like a pit, get ya ears and ya tail cut
Choppas still hot, you can hold it for yourself
Versace, same buckle on the loafers and the belt
Yeah the pills is flying but the smokers is something else
If the spot catch fire, the coke will just really melt
The dough got 'em bringing in the broads
Obvious the flow got 'em screaming for the lord
If there’s money on ya head what you think is the reward?
I ain't do it for myself, you know who I did it for?
I did it for my dawgz
Oh Lord!

Now check this out, one day back in Philly
Four guys wanted to sing
They came up to me, I said, "Well, what's your name?
(Boyz II Men) Hey, you know what I'm sayin'?"
Then I said, "Alright, fellas
Well, let me see what you can do"
And then the smart one named Wanya said
"Yo Mike, check this out, see if this one moves you"

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Motownphilly back again
Doin' a little East Coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft
("Okay, party people in the house")

It's long overdue but now

Jet black Benz, plenty of friends
(And all the Philly steaks you can eat)

[Pre-Chorus: Wanya Morris, Shawn Stockman, Boyz II Men]
Back in school
We used to dream about this every day
(Could it really happen?)
Or do dreams just fade away?
Then we started singing
And they said it sounded smooth
And we started a group and here we are
Kickin' it just for you, oh, oh

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Motownphilly back again
Doin' a little East Coast swing
Boyz II Men going off

Keep flippin' the gift

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman, Nathan Morris, Boyz II Men]
The spotlight is on us now, watch us do this
Da da ("Turn it up"), da da da, da da da da da da ("Turn it up")
Live and direct from Phillytown
Rappin' hype and we can get down
We are ready to roll
So now the world will know that we flow

[Pre-Chorus: Wanya Morris, Shawn Stockman, Boyz II Men]
Back in school we used to dream about this every day
(Could it really happen?)
Or do dreams just fade away?
Then we started singing
And they said it sounded smooth
So we started a group and here we are
Kickin' it just for you, oh, oh

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Motownphilly back again
Doin' a little East Coast swing
Boyz II Men going off (Go, go)
Not too hard, not too soft

[Bridge: Boyz II Men]
Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men

Then we started singing
And they said it sounded smooth

You don't even have to call, even check for me at all
Because the way I been actin' lately has been off the wall

Especially towards you, puttin' girls before you
And they watchin' everything I been doin' just to hurt you
Most of it just ain't true and they won't show you
How much of a queen you are to me and why I love you baby

Nobody wanna see us together

Nobody wanna see us together

The A-U-T-O-L-O-G-I-C
Hey
The A-U-T-O-L-O-G-I-C

Drop auto logic
You thought you could get with
Me and Tommy hittin' man
Cold dropped a smash hits
Angry as a veteran
Back in the force
'Cause I'm not frontin'
Comin' upon the stage I'll say ya somethin'

Clear as a project
The style is hectic
Guess I'm left with
A system skeptic
The truths I'm droppin'
From the pulpit I'm yellin'
Inspired by gunshots from a township rebellion
Word is a rough mix
Sign of justice
The rhyme is allowed 'cause you can't fillibust this
Style I'll catch ya
I'll catch ya the rapture
Ya murdered my level head
Ya know that I have to
Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic

Stop before you take a wrong turn
Stop before you step up on the stage and get burned
Stop and just listen
I'm dismissing competition with decisions
So I guess you'll have to listen and learn
Creative
So what ya gonna do?
Ain't no fading
So what ya gonna do?
Grab the microphone and say a check one two
The kid's solo
Unafraid of any crew
'Cause I'm the type of brother with the maddest
Status
Statue or poll
Paid in full
No bull never dull
Always in control
Taking no shit like I was Manute Bol
Uh
Aw yeah
It goes a just like that yeah
Now break it down

Auto logic
On auto pilot
Silence equals death
And death equals silence
The crew that doesn't choose to speak their mind
Is a crew that looses power over time
And now that ya finally woke up
Yo wish your motherfuckin' ass would have spoke up
Voices in full
The balled of the bullet
The mic is a trigger and I pull it
Droppin' and smashin'
Thrashin' and bashin' the set
Mentally and spiritually correct
Back and ya know it's a treat
'Cause every time I step ya know I won't forget ta

Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Drop auto logic
Yo I got to drop the logic
Come on
Give me all, give me all, give me all attention baby
I got to tell you a little something about yourself
You're wonderful, flawless, ooh you're a sexy lady
But you walk around here like you wanna be someone else
Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine
(fine, so fine)
Ooooooooooohhhhhhhhh
Oh girl I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine(mine, oh mine)
Treasure, that is what you are
Honey you're my golden star
I know you could make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you
Oh oooooh
Pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl you should be smiling
A girl like you should never look so blue
You're everything I see in my dreams
I wouldn't say that to you if it wasn't true
Oooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhh
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine
(fine, so fine)
Ooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh
Oh girl I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine(mine, oh mine)
Treasure, that is what you are
Honey you're my golden star
I know you could make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you
You are my treasure, you are my treasure
You are my treasure, yeah, you you you, you are
You are my treasure, you are my treasure
You are my treasure, yeah, you you you, you are
Treasure, that is what you are
Honey you're my golden star
I know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you
Silently the morning mist is lying on the water
Captive moonlight waiting for the dawn
Softly like a baby's breath a breeze begins to whisper
The sun is coming, quick you must be gone
Smiling like a superstar the morning comes in singing
The promise of another sunny day
And all the flowers open up to gather in the sunshine
I do believe that summer's here to stay

And oh I love the life within me
I feel part of everything I see
And oh I love the life around me
A part of everything

Riding on the tapestry of all there is to see
So many ways and oh so many things
Rejoicing in the differences
There's no one just like me
Yet as different as we are , we're still the same

And oh I love the life within me
I feel part of everything I see
And oh I love the life around me
A part of everything is here in me

[Verse 1]
Look at this place
It's not how it used to seem
They're all the same
But living in a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not running
I've just got to get away
Sure, it's fun and everything
But I won't stay

[Chorus]
So home
At last
I'm home
At last

[Verse 2]
So I forgot
It didn't change a thing
Miss her a lot
She kept us company

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not hiding
I'm just trying to get it out
Sure, it's testing
But that's not what it's about

So home

[Intro]
Cover up
(Load it up! Person down! Shoot to kill!)
Cover up
(Empty clip! Shoot to kill! Make sure that no one is looking!)

[Verse 1]
Public servant / swine abuse: I thought we were over this?
Did you see them kill him? Crush him?
Try to fight then cling to life
Here lies our right to coincide
Temperamental sadists with a badge disguise
Will force their way

[Verse 2]
Kill them. Crush them
Stand and watch them cling to life
Karma works too slow
No regrets for what you've done
You are nothing when you take away the gun
(Nothing at all) When you take away the gun
(Nothing at all) When you take it away

[Verse 3]
Let's sit you down, peel all your nails back
Now do you feel all the fear you lack?

[Chorus]
I see them feigning for a stranglehold on all of us
Are you a god? Are we supposed to live beneath you?
Are you a god? Are we supposed to live beneath you?

[Bridge]
Kick someone enough and they will not get up
Kick someone enough and they will not get up
"Better it's you than me" mentality
Censor the time and the place and remember to pick up the brains that were sprayed out all over the floor

[Chorus]
I see them feigning for a stranglehold on all of us
Are you a god? Are we supposed to live beneath you?
(Kick someone enough and they will not get up)
Are you a god? Are we supposed to live beneath you?
(Kick someone enough and they will not get up)

[Outro]
Kick someone enough and they will not get up
Kick someone enough and they will not get up

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin' lit, feelin' right, 2 AM, summer night
I don't care, hand on the wheel
Drivin' drunk, I'm doin' my thing
Rollin' the midwest side and out
Livin' my life, gettin' out dreams
I'ma do just what I want, lookin' ahead no turnin' back
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out "Fuck that"
I'm screaming out "Fuck that", I'm screaming out "Fuck that"
Fuck that, fuck that, fuck that, fuck that

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Tell me what you know about dreamin', dreamin'?
You don't really know about nothin', nothin'
Tell me what you know about them night terrors every night
5 AM, cold sweats, waking up, to the sky

[Chorus: MGMT & Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams?
Tell me what you know about night terrors? Nothin'
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in a bed full of sorrow

[Chorus: MGMT & Kid Cudi]
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good

[Chorus]
To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me?
To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me?

[Verse 1]
No (Don't say)
I'm not gonna turn my back on you
You know I'll never let you down
(Ah, ha) No way
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down, no way

[Pre-Chorus]
Try to tell you that it's all right
Oooh, I'm not playing
Can't you see what I am saying?
You are my religion

[Chorus]
To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me?
To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me?

[Verse 2]
No (Don't say)
I'm not gonna turn my back on you
You know I'll never let you down
(Ah, ha) No way
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down, no way

[Pre-Chorus]
Try to tell you that it's all right
Oooh, I'm not playing
Can't you see what I'm saying?
You are my religion

[Chorus]
To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me?
To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me?

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
When I'm fishtailing, out of Atlantic City
And a car that cost a half a millie
Trying to turn up too quick
This spilled drink on my dick
Bad bitch, on my right side, she flip it
Damn you got some pretty titties
And I love when she call Guwop big poppa
Cause we fucking all night like Kim and Peggy
Double cup of that candy
Got a quarter pound of that good keef
Pour the whole pint on her pussy
And now her pussy sticky
We just came back from Italy
And the feds said they want to convict me
But I'm feelin' like Big Meechy
'Cause I'm still gonna plea not guilty
See my girl she was keeping two C's on it
Her dollar card got two B's on it
Plus all my cars got Fs on 'em
But my lil boy's car got Es on it
Your CD ain't got nothing on it
Bought your CD just to roll weed on it
Your girl told me they ain't got nothin' on me
Fuck her 20 minutes now she nutted on me

Cause we're California cruising, when we do it, California cruising, alright
We're California cruising, look where we got, California cruising
Look where we got, look where we got baby
Look where we got, look where we got baby

Cruising down Hollywood
Windows down, feeling good, yeah
Feeling better than I've ever been, it must be adrenaline
As we're cruising down Sunset all night, all night

[Chorus]
Cause we're California cruising, when we do it
California cruising, alright
We're California cruising, California cruising
Look where we got, look where we got baby

[Verse 2]
101 is backed up, Laurel Canyon is the way to go
Windows down, Mac black truck, I can take it where you wanna go
Venice beach, you can see clear, almost as pretty as you dear
Wanna be, you should make it clear, we can roll out, skrr skrr

Cause we're California cruising, when we do it
California cruising, alright
We're California cruising, California cruising
Look where we got, look where we got baby

That's life (That's life), that's what all the people say
You're riding high in April, shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June
I said, that's life (That's life), and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks, stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down
'Cause this fine old world, it keeps spinning around

[Chorus]
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race

[Verse 2]
That's life (That's life), I tell ya, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting, baby
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly

[Chorus]
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing
Each time I find myself laying flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get back in the race

[Outro]
That's life (That's life), that's life and I can't deny it
Many times I thought of cutting out but my heart won't buy it
But if there's nothing shaking come this here July
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die
My, my

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Yeah my pockets got the mumps like professor Klump
This while I pull up in the front in my fuckin' dump
A lot of racks in my jeans, about 30 grand
I got the battle of the bands in my fuckin' pants
I'm throwin' Hamiltons and Grants like I'm Kev Durant
Comparin' us to them's like elephants to fuckin'...
Well we on fire and nationwide, globalized and verbalized
In Robin jeans and True Religions, don't like suits, don't wear ties
We wise guys with mob ties, shoot more than A.I
We ball harder, you know why
We way smarter than most guys
I'm banked up, like a dope dealer
6s on a four wheeler
We tatted up and grilled out
Brick Squad 1017 thugged out

[Hook]
I'm on a money scheme, on a money scheme
Yeah my pockets got the mumps like professor Klump

He wants me, she said that it might glow
These presidents, they haunt me, they go everywhere I go

Money schemin', catch me speedin' like I gotta get me more
And yeah I'm a cat so I'm crazy with the scratch
Bout that guala, guala, cheese, cheaper nigga callin' back
Hella, all I fuckin' need is some mothafuckin' racks
And a stripper with a booty that know how to make it clap
Cause I can make it rain, I know how to make it back
Money come, money go, but somehow we stay attached
I dunno what's gotten into me, I don't know how act
But I'm back up n my rizzly and I'm 'bout to attack

[Hook]
I'm on a money scheme, on a money scheme
Yeah my pockets got the mumps like professor Klump
I'm on a money scheme, bitch I'm on a money scheme
Yeah my pockets got the mumps like professor Klump
I'm on a money scheme, bitch I'm on a money scheme
Yeah my pockets got the mumps like professor Klump
I'm on a money scheme, on a money scheme
Yeah my pockets got the mumps like professor Klump

Million dollars worth of diamonds in my mama's basement

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say

And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
Oh yeah
I come up hard baby, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it sugar, playin' by the rules
I come up hard baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin trouble sugar, movin' down the line
I come up hard but that's okay
'Cause trouble man, don't get in my way
I come up hard, baby
I've been for real, baby, gonna keep movin', gonna go to town
I come up hard I come up gettin' down
There's only three things that's for sure
Taxes, death and trouble
This I know baby, this I know sugar
Girl Ain't gon let it sweat me babe
Got me singin', yeah, yeah, ooh
Come up hard, baby, I had to fight
Took care my business with all my might
I come up hard, come up hard, I had to win
Then start all over and win again
I come up hard but that's okay
'Cause trouble man don't get in my way, hey, hey
I know some places and I seen some faces
I got my connections, they take my directions
What people say, that's okay, they don't bother me, no
I'm ready to make it, don't care 'bout the weather
Don't care 'bout no trouble, got myself together
Laughin', no cryin', my protection's all around me
I come up hard, baby, I've been for real, baby
With the trouble mind, movin', goin' tight
I come up hard, come on, get down
There's only three things for sure
Taxes, death and trouble, oh
This I know, baby, this I've known, baby
Hey now, let it sweat, baby, ooh
All right, baby, ooh
I've come up hard, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it, baby, playin' by the rules
I've come up hard, baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble, sugar, hey, movin' down the line, oh
Now you know the world's all in a tangle, man
Everybody begin to sing this song
The Reds are just over yonder boys
And we ain't gonna be here long
That's why I'm gonna build myself a cave
Move down in the ground
When I go into the army, babe
Won't be no more Reds around
Now you know I got my personary man
I've got my class cattoo
I begin to feel so worried
I just don't know what to do
That's why I'm gonna build myself a cave
Move down in the ground
When I go into the army, babe
There won't be no more reds around me
Now you know the world's all in a tangle man
Everybody begin to sing this song
The Reds are just over yonder boys
And we ain't gonna be here long
That's why I'm gonna build myself a cave
Move down in the ground
When I go into the army, babe
There won't be no more Reds around me
Nobody loves me, but my mother
And she could me jivin' too

Nobody loves me, but my mother
And she could me jivin' too

Now you see why I act so funny, baby
When you do the things you do
Tach it up, tach it up
Buddy gonna shut you down
It happened on the strip where the road is wide
(Ooo, rev it up now)
Two cool shorts standin' side by side
(Ooo, rev it up now)
Yeah, my fuel injected Stingray and a four-thirteen
(Ooo, rev it up now)
A revin' up our engines and it sounds real mean
(Ooo, rev it up now)
Tach it up, tach it up
Buddy gonna shut you down
Declinin' numbers at an even rate
(Ooo, movin' out now)
At the count of one we both accelerate
(Ooo, movin' out now)
Ya my stingray is light and the slicks are startin' to spin
(Ooo, movin' out now)
But the my four-thirteen's really diggin' in
(Ooo, movin' out now)
Gotta be cool now
Power shift here we go
Superstock dodge is windin' out in low
But my fuel injected Stingray's really startin' to go
To get the traction I'm ridin' the clutch
My pressure plate's burnin,' that machine's too much
Pedal's to the floor, hear the dual quads drink
(Ooo, pump it up now)
And now the four-thirteen's lead is startin' to shrink
(Ooo, pump it up now)
He's hot with ram induction but it's understood
(Ooo, pump it up now)
I got a fuel injected engine sittin' under my hood
(Ooo, pump it up now)
Shut it off, shut it off
Buddy, now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off
Buddy, now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off
Buddy, now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off
Buddy, now I shut you down
Shut it off, shut it off
Buddy, now I shut you down
Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
The wall to wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Ohhh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural, religiously unkind
Oh no love! You're not alone
You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up
But if I could only make you care
Oh no love! You're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone
Just turn on with me and you're not alone
Let's turn on with me and you're not alone
Gimme your hands 'cause you're wonderful
Gimme your hands 'cause you're wonderful
Oh gimme your hands
You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart

I feel like this is the beginning
Though I've loved you for a million years
And if I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears

You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
That's why I'll always stay around, mmm yeah yeah
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart

You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue
And I know that this must be heaven
How could so much love be inside of you?

You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
That's why I'll always stay around, mmm yeah yeah
You are the apple of my eye (Love has joined us)
Forever you'll stay in my heart (Love has joined us)
Yeah, you are the sunshine of my life, baby (Love has joined us)
That's why I'll always stay around (Love has joined us)...(fade)
Hey, I'm walking with my woman
She got great big feet
Long, lean and angry
She ain't had nothing to eat
But she's my woman
And I love her just the same
She's a fine looking woman
And Caldonia is her name

Now here we go!

Caldonia, Caldonia
What makes your big head so hard
I love her
Yeah, I love her just the same

Give me that now

I'm crazy about the woman
'Cause Caldonia is her name
Can we do it once more?

Caldonia, Caldonia
What makes your big head so hard, oh

Caldonia, Caldonia, Caldonia

[Verse]
I wrote a letter I mailed in the...
Mailed it in the air indeed-e
I wrote a letter, I mailed in the air
You may know by that I have got a friend somewhere

[Instrumental]

[Verse repeated]
I wrote a letter I mailed in the...
Mailed it in the air indeed-e
I wrote a letter, I mailed in the air
You may know by that I have got a friend somewhere
Testin', testin', testin'
You can hear me, what what what?
Testin', testin', testin'
You can hear me, what what what?
Mic, check , check, check check
You can hear me?
I'm loud enough?
Mic mic, microphone, check, check
Can you hear me?
Yikes, you know what I like?
I keep it hype, the words that I write
I rock the whole crowd, I don't need a mic
I say my rhyme loud, with all of my might
Yikes, you know what I like?
I keep it hype, the words that I write
I rock the whole crowd, I don't need a mic
I say my rhyme loud, with all of my might
People say that nigga crazy, I'm throwin' off, I raise my voice up then, go off
The king of different, Titan of screamin' chantin' louder than
A hundred people clappin' keep them fuckin' speakers crackin'
Rockin' it, about to roll the sticker on the tag can't make it ragged
Vocals that'll blow horns 'til your ass in traction
Disgusting like that valve on your bike with the basket
Bling bling comin' through, not excuse me
I'm the nigga that's makin' this loud ass music
Yikes, you know what I like?
I keep it hype, the words that I write
I rock the whole crowd, I don't need a mic
I say my rhyme loud, with all of my might
Yikes, You know what I like?
I keep it hype, the words that I write
I rock the whole crowd, I don't need a mic
I say my rhyme loud, with all of my might
The doctor slapped my ass, so I've been hollerin' since an infant
Gotta make sure they hear me 'cause I wants my attention
Disturb the class, so I stayed in detention
Couldn't whisper when I was talkin' so they sent me to the office
The principal say, "Young man what seem to be the problem?"
Said, "I try to be quiet but I just can't seem to lower the volume"
"Hmm, what's your name?" "Michael Tyler"
"Perhaps you'd be interested in joining our school choir?"
Said, "Nah, that's for funny boys"
"Either that or a suspension," While you roll, here I come boy
I wanna holla, but I gotta try
Doe ray mi fah soh! Ahh no!
That ain't gonna cut it, that ain't gonna get it
Then the teacher said, "Maybe you can try something mathematic"
But I'm too clumsy so I went to the band
But I made more noise honkin' than I did when I was playin'
Yikes! That ain't workin' so I'm leavin'
The very next day I was in R O T C
Had no problems soundin' off like I had a pair, three four
But I just ain't like them tight ass green pants that I had to wear
All this time inside, made me tired, on top of that
One of my teachers wanna see my ass outside
I went downstairs to the yard
When I got there I seen my teacher with about eight fine broads
I said, "You lookin' for me? I'm the one who be talkin' loud"
She said, "Damn, nigga we need you on our cheerleadin' squad"
Hell no, never ever Trevor
Either that or a report card filled with the F letter
Go, team, fight, win
Nah this shit ain't cool, fuck these teachers and this school
I gotta loud mouth but I don't know what to use it for
'Til they told me that they was gon' put me in the talent show
Yikes, you know what I like?
I keep it hype, the words that I write
I rock the whole crowd, I don't need a mic
I say my rhyme loud, with all of my might
Yikes, you know what I like?
I keep it hype, the words that I write
I rock the whole crowd, I don't need a mic
I say my rhyme loud, with all of my might
Yikes
Yikes
Yikes

The sunday mornin' gospel goes good with the soul
There's blues, folk, and country, and rock like a rollin' stone
The world could come together as one
If everybody under the sun
Add some music to your day
(Add some music add some add some music to your day)
A bob didit a bop didit
You'll hear it while you're walkin' by a neighbor's home
You'll hear it faintly in the distance when you're on the phone
You're sittin' in a dentist's chair
And they've got music for you there
To add some music
(Add some music add some add some music to your)
To your day
A bob didit a bop didit
Add some music music everywhere (add some music)
Add some add some add some add some music (add some music)
Your doctor knows it keeps you calm
Your preacher adds it to his psalms
So add some music
(Add some music add some add some music to your)
To your day
Music
(Add some music add some music)
When you're alone
(Add some music add some music)
Is like a companion
(Add some music add some music)
For your lonely soul
Oo oo oo woo oo woo oo oo oo oooo
When day is over (when day is over)
I close my tired eyes (I close my tired)
Music is in my soul
At a movie you can feel it touching your heart
And on every day of the summertime
You'll hear children chasing ice cream carts
They'll play it on your wedding day
There must be 'bout a million ways
To add some music
(Add some music add some add some music to your)
To your day
Add some music to your day
Add some music to your day
Add some music to your day
Add some music to your day
Add some music to your day

[Intro]
Yo G, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, ha?

[Hook]
I spit it through the wire man
It's too much stuff in my heart right now man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kanye to the
Chi-town what's going on?

[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, and Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizzerk
Not to worry Mr. H said the izzles back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell, that her guy look like Emitt Till
She was with me before the deal, she been tryin' to be mine
She a delta so she been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use me trying to be lyin', I been trying to be signed
Trying to be a millionaire, how I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here is history in the makin' man
I really apologize how I sound right now man
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut for like
I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks
You know we had reconstruct
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror, half my jaw was missing
In the back of my mouth, man I couldn't believe it
I'm still here for y'all right now man
This is what I gotta say, right here dog
Yeah, turn me up yeah
What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking 'bout Coke and birds
It was more like spoken word except he's really puttin' it down
And he explained the story about how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God drive a two on the sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe, safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky
It was televised, there's been an accident like Geico
They thought I was burnt up, like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta Angel, 'cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what you thought they called me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us, where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid sh** that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

[Outro Hook]
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had a um
I was goin' to have a plate in my chin
I said, dawg don't you realize
I'll never make it on the plane now?
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on
She can't be serious man
(For a chance at loving you
I'd take it all the way
Right down through the wire
Even through the fire)
(Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, to the limit)
Lonely, my life used to be lonely
Lonely as the single lonely number one
Lonely like a lonely sun
With not even one iota to shine upon

Crying, deep inside I was crying
Like the muddy Mississippi, my tears flowed
Carrying with it my lonely soul
With not even a clue of who
Where or what I would become

Oh, how I longed to be possessed by one somebody
To hold me, control me, show me what I should
Do with my broken life
But oh, was I lifted when I let your light
Inside my body
Then I shed my sorrows for joy, love and
You in my, my, my, my li-li-life

I'm dancing to the rythm of your love
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love
Forever greateful for your love
Money, oh how did I have money
Enough to last me from the start til the end of time
With some more to leave behind
And yet I was a cent-less pauper in distress
I can, feel the very presence of your love here
Though I've never seen the pleasure of your smile
No, I've never touched your hand
And yet you've given me eternal happiness

Oh, how I longed to be possessed by one somebody
To hold me, control me, show me what I should
Do with my broken life
But oh, was I lifted when I let your light
Inside my body
Then I shed my sorrows for joy, love and you in my
My, my, my li-li-life

I'm dancing to the rythm of your love
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love
Forever greateful for your sweet, sweet love
I'm dancing to the rythm of your love
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love
Forever greateful for your sweet, sweet love
Oh, how I longed to be possessed by one somebody
To hold me, control me, show me what I should do
With my broken life
But oh, was I lifted when I let God's light
Inside my body
Then I shed my sorrows for joy, love and you
In my, my, my, my li-li-life

I'm dancing to the rythm of your love
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love
Giving all praises of your sweet, sweet love
Forever greateful for your sweet, sweet love
I'm dancing to the rythm of your love
Singing sweet melodies of your sweet, sweet love
Giving all praises of your sweet, sweet love
Forever greateful for your sweet, sweet love
The best things in life are free
But you can give then to the birds and bees

What can you say? There isn't much to tell
I'm going down hill and i blame myself I've been
Jumping at Shadows
Thinking about my life

Everybody points their hand at me
I know I'm just a picture
Of what I should have been I've been
Jumping at Shadows Just thinking
About my life

God have mercy I think I'm going insane
The Devil's been gettin' at me
He's got me down again Got me
Jumping at Shadows Just thinking
About my life
Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo
There was a rose I knew
I met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing
Not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game
And played with her youth
Unashamed of the way you lied
Played with the truth, hey hey
Mmm, she never knew what hit her, yeah
Steal her honey, then forget her
A rose, she wears a flower
Tryin' to forget about you
Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power
Now believe me when I tell you
That I've been hurt myself
When he tells you that he loves you
And sees nobody else
And now you're so tough tryin' to
Wear tight clothes and things
Tossin' and flossin'
Tryin' to fill the void heartbreak brings
Oh yeah, when she faces the mirror, yeah
She's cryin', you can't hear her
Now the rose is still a rose
She wears a flower, tryin' to forget about you
Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl, you hold the power
See a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power
Let your life be in the sunshine
Not the darkness of your sorrow
You may see you're all today
When you know it'll come tomorrow
Tough to be, but life ain't over
Just because your man is gone
Girl, love yourself and love to love
Cause without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on
Without him your life goes on
Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl, you hold the power
See a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't lead you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power
When sky blue gets dark enough
To see the colors of the city lights
A trail of ruby red and diamond white
Hits her like a sunrise
She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one cares
Tonight she's out to lose herself
And find a high on Peachtree Street
From mixed drinks to techno beats it's always
Heavy into everything
She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one cares
She comes and goes and no one knows
She's slipping through my hand
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away
Oh 

[Incomprehensible] about that
I can't be her angel now
You know it's not my place to hold her down
And it's hard for me to take a stand
When I would take her anyway I can
She comes and she goes
Like no one cares
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns
No, no, no, no, no
She comes and she goes
Like no one cares
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away
Remember me (aaaaah-ha!)
I've been here before
Remember me (aaaaah-ha!)
I've been here before
Can't you see
I'm gonna stick around some more

Can't you see (aaaaah-ha!)
I want some love from you
Can't you see (aaaaah-ha!)
I want some love from you
Don't go away now
I've got something to give to you

I'll try to be (aaaaa-ha!)
As good as gold to you
Try to be (aaaaa-ha!)
As good as gold to you
But don't blame me, girl
If I'm far from cold to you
Remember me (aaaaa-ha!)
I've been here before
Remember me (aaaaa-ha!)
I've been here before
Don't go away now
Come and stick around some more
Yeah

[Spoken Intro]
There is some unbelievable music that has come out of artists who are from LA, did you know that?
Like Los Angeles has put out so many bands and artists that I’m such a fan of and
I’d love to play you  some music I’m a fan of that’s come from LA, is that okay?
This one came out in 1981: 8 years before I was born and I love this song, it’s called “Bette Davis Eyes”

[Verse 1]
Her hair is Harlow gold
Her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll turn her music on
You won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow
She’s  got Bette Davis eyes

[Chorus 1]
And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo stand off sighs
She's got Bette Davis eyes

[Verse 2]
She'll let you take her home
It whets her appetite
She'll lay you on her throne
She’s  got Bette Davis eyes

[Chorus 2]
She'll expose you
And just knows you
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush (ayy,ayy)
All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes

[Intro: Pharrell]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
One thing I ask of you
Let me be the one you back that ass to
Go, from Malibu, to Paris, boo
Yeah, I had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you
So hit me up when you passing through
I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two
Swag on, even when you dress casual
I mean it's almost unbearable
Then, honey you're not there when I'm
With my foresight bitch you pay me by
Nothing like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that
So I just watch and wait for you to salute
But you didn't pick
Not many women can refuse this pimpin'
I'm a nice guy, but don't get it if you get with me

[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
Shake the vibe, get down, get up
Do it like it hurt, like it hurt
What you don't like work?

[Pre-Chorus: Robin Thicke]
Baby can you breathe? I got this from Jamaica
It always works for me, Dakota to Decatur, uh huh
No more pretending
Hey, hey, hey

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
I always wanted a good girl

Must wanna get nasty
Go ahead, get at me

[Outro: Pharrell]
Everybody get up
Everybody get up
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
We met when she was younger
Then, I had no eyes for her
A few years went by and I saw her
Now I'm gonna try for her
Look out babe
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
How could I ever have known that
She'd be what she is today?
And look at how her boyfriend holds her
I'll be moving in one day
Split man
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
La doo day p-pow pow pow
La doo day p-pow pow pow
La doo day p-pow pow pow
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
...

[Verse 1]
The ashtray says
You were up all night
When you went to bed
With your darkest mind
Your pillow wept
And covered your eyes
And you finally slept
While the sun caught fire
You've changed

[Verse 2]
We fell in love
In the key of C
We walked along
Down by the sea
You followed me down
The neck to D
And fell again
Into the sea
You changed
Oh, you've changed

[Hook]
Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
Something in my veins bloodier than blood

[Verse 3]
The ashtray says
You were up all night
When you went to bed
With your darkest mind
You changed
Oh, you've changed

[Outro]
What you once were isn't what you want to be any more
"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash."

I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby my mama told me, "Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

SooooEEEE!!

I bet there's rich folks eating from a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin' and that's what tortures me

Well if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
Somebody's gonna hurt someone
Before the night is through
Somebody's gonna come undone
There's nothin' we can do

Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance
Make it come out right

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight, I know
Lord, I know

Some people like to stay out late
Some folks can't hold out that long
But nobody wants to go home now
There's too much goin' on

This night is gonna last forever
Last all, last all summer long
Some time before the sun comes up
The radio is gonna play that song
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Lord, I know

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
The moon's shinin' bright
So turn out the light, and we'll get it right
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know
Heartache baby

Somebody's gonna hurt someone
(Somebody)
Before the night is through
Somebody's gonna come undone
There's nothin' we can do
(Everybody)
Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance
To make it come out right

There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight, I know
Let's go
We can beat around the bushes
We can get down to the bone
We can leave it in the parkin' lot
But either way, there's gonna be
A heartache tonight, a heartache tonight
Oh, I know
There'll be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know, whoo hoo
Break my heart

[Paradise]

[Verse 1]
I'd wash the sand off the shore
Give you the world if it was mine
Blow you right to my door
Feels fine

[Chorus]
Feels like
You're mine
Feels right
So fine
I'm yours
You're mine
Like paradise

[Verse 2]
I'd wash the sand off the shore
Give you the world if it was mine
Blow you right to my door
Feels fine

[Chorus]
Feels like
You're mine
I'm yours
So fine
Like paradise

[Outro]
I wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you
Wanna share my life
I wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you
Wanna share my life
(Wanna share my life with you)
I wanna share my life (Like paradise)
Wanna share my life with you
Wanna share my life
I wanna share my life with you
I wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you
Wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you

I wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you
Wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you

[Nothing Can Come Between Us]

[Intro]
Let me see everyone do it
All the people in the back
Everyone that's having a good time, let me hear you say 'Yeah'
Say 'Oh yeah'
Now somebody scream

[Chorus]
Nothing can come
Nothing can come
Nothing can come between us
Nothing can come
Nothing can come
Nothing can come between us

(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
It's about faith

It's about trust
(Oh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Interlude]
So this goes to the people that are sitting down
Get up on your feet right now
Jump on your feet, oh, jump on your feet
Put your hands together with me
Everyone, one, two, three, let's sing it

[Chorus]
Nothing can come
(You sing it now)
Nothing can come
Nothing can come between us

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Angel came down from heaven yesterday
She stayed with me
Just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between
The moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she is going to come back tomorrow

[Chorus]
And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm going to be by your side"

[Verse 2]
Sure enough this morning came unto me
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
And my angel she said unto me
"Today is the day for you to rise
Take my hand, you are going to be my man
You are going to rise"
And then she took me high over yonder

[Chorus]
And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Forever I will be by your side"

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
But Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground

[Chorus]
Smoke on the water and fire in the sky
Smoke on the water, yeah

[Verse 2]
They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

[Chorus]
Smoke on the water and fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know I know we'll never forget

[Chorus]
Smoke on the water and fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
Now here it is three o' clock in the mornin'
And I can't even close my eyes
It's three o' clock in the mornin', baby
I can't even close my eyes
Well, you know I can't find my baby

[Incomprehensible] I can't be satisfied
Well, now looked around me
And my baby, she can't be found
I've looked around me, people
My baby, she can't be found
Well, you know that if I don't find my baby
People, I'm goin' down under the golden ground
Goodbye everybody
I do believe this is the end
Goodbye everybody
I do believe this is the end
Yes, I want you to tell my baby
To forgive me for my sins

[Intro: Jill Scott, Ronald Isley]
There's so many things I want to say, baby
So many words, oh (Well well well)
You know what I mean?
(Oh, I know, I know)

[Verse 1: Jill Scott, Ronald Isley]
Loving you is easy
Loving you is like breathing
Winter, winter, spring, natural evolution
Loving you is righteous
Ever green light just shines bright (Oh yeah)
When I'm with you
Ooh, there's so much I want to say, baby (Oh)

[Chorus: Ronald Isley & Jill Scott + Jill Scott ad-libs]
Said enough
I just want you to know
Said enough
So much I want to say
Said enough
I love
Said enough

[Verse 2: Ronald Isley]
Loving you, loving you is like sweeter than candy
Feels like I'm in heaven (Like heaven, like heaven)
Sweet like a morning kiss, oh
Loving you is so beautiful, baby
Loving you is food for my soul
Baby, you know, you know, you know
Oh, what I'm trying to say, girl
I gotta let you know just what I feel

[Chorus: Ronald Isley, Jill Scott, Both]
(Said enough)
Gotta let you know what I feel
Gotta let you know my heart, baby
Gotta let you know what's in my heart, baby
I wanna let you to know just what I'm thinking
(Said enough)
How you know what I'm thinking?
I want you to know
(Said enough)
Oh, I think I said
I got to let you know
(Said enough)
Gotta let you know, you know, babe
Your love, your love
(Said enough)
My baby, my baby
So, so in love
(Said enough)
So good, you're so good, baby
Baby...
(Said enough)

[Outro: Jill Scott, Ron Isley, Both]
There's nothing...
Nothing in this world
...in this world that could take what we have away
That would take what we have away, oh no
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing left to say
Nothing left to say
I said
(Said enough)
You said
Nothing left to say
(Said enough)
No no no no no, nothing, baby
I said enough, said enough
(Said enough)
You said, and I said, and we said
(Said enough)
Ooh, you said
All I need to know, girl
(Said enough)
That's all I need to know, baby
(Said enough)
No no no no no no no no

Oh, oh baby

[Spoken Intro]
You know... You guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know that?

[Verse 1]
Now that he's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey
He walks like summer and talks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
Since his return from the stay on the moon
He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey

[Chorus]
Tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights are faded
And that heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

[Verse 2]
Now that he's back from that soul vacation
Tracing his way through the constellation, hey, hey
He checks out Mozart while he does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey
Now that he's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that he might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
Who is too afraid to fly so he never did land

[Chorus]
Tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along in the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

[Bridge]
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?

[Chorus]
Tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while
You were looking for yourself?

[Refrain]
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, oh
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, oh
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, oh
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, oh

[Outro]
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?

[Intro: Timbaland]
Yeah, yeah (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah)
One at a time, baby
Yeah, yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
I ain't got no money
I ain't got no car to take you on a date
I can't even buy you flowers
But together we'll be the perfect soulmates
Talk to me, girl

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go Dutch, you can still touch my love, it's free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right

[Hook: Keri Hilson & (Timbaland)]
Baby, if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
(I'm about to strip and I'm well equipped
Can you handle me the way I'm are?)
I don't need the G's or the car keys
Boy, I like you just the way you are
Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like, I like, I like

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
I ain't got no Visa
I ain't got no Red American Express
We can't go nowhere exotic
It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that loves you best
Talk to me, girl

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go Dutch, you can still touch, my love is free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right

[Hook: Keri Hilson & (Timbaland)]
Baby, if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
(I'm about to strip and I'm well equipped

I don't need the G's or the car keys
Boy, I like you just the way you are
Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like, I like, I like...

[Verse 3: John Doe/D.O.E]
Baby girl, I don't got a huge ol' house, I rent a room in a house
Listen baby girl, I ain't got a motorboat, but I can float ya boat
So listen baby girl, once you get a dose of D.O.E., you gon' want some mo'
So listen baby girl, when I make it, I want you back, want you back, yeah

[Verse 4: Sebastian]
Yeah my money ain't aloof like Phil and them
And it's really not quite low as LSN
Your body ain't Pamela Anderson
It's a struggle just to get you in the caravan
But listen baby girl
Before I let you lose a pound I'll buy a bigger car
So listen baby girl
I love you just the way ya are, the way ya are

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go Dutch you can still touch, my love is free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right

[Hook: Keri Hilson & Timbaland]
Baby if you strip, you can get a tip
Cause I like you just the way you are
(I'm about to strip and I'm well equipped
Can you handle me the way I'm are?)
I don't need the G's or the car keys
Boy I like you just the way you are
Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
Cause I like, I like, I like

Well, I'm running down the road
Tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind
Four that wanna own me
Two that wanna stone me
One says she's a friend of mine

Take It easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels
Drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand
And take it easy
Well, I'm a standing on a corner
In Winslow, Arizona
And such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me

Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love
Is gonna save me
We may lose and we may win
Though we will never be here again
So open up, I'm climbin' in
So take it easy

Well I'm running down the road
Trying to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover
Who won't blow my cover
She's so hard to find

Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels
Make you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love
Is gonna save me, oh oh oh
Oh we got it easy
We oughta take it easy
I'm losing my mind, 'cause she's one of a kind
Oh, she's so fine, gotta make her mine
Everything I do is only for you, 'cause you're my boo
Yes it's so true

My heart is so broken it's splitting in two
Looking so sad 'cause I'm feeling so through
Missing the days of being with you
'Cause I was stuck to you, girl
Feel like I'm trapped and I cannot get loose
'Cause I'm so lost I don't know what to do
Yeah, I'm so bad and I'm confused, but I'm still stuck to you, girl

[Joel Madden]
'Cause even when I meet you, yeah I knew I couldn't have you
I knew that I would try, and mess it up, what can I do?
And even when you're gone and all my friends will say I'm crazy
Say it ain't right, I want you to have my baby

Oh, Shoulda let you go x3
Let you go

[Sean Kingston]

Now I'm sitting home, feeling all alone
Wish you had a clone, 'cause girl you got me gone
Here in this chair, wishing you was here
But now it's getting clear, that you don't even care

My heart is so broken it's splitting in two
Looking so sad 'cause I'm feeling so through
Missing the days of being with you
'Cause I was stuck to you, girl
Feel like I'm trapped and I cannot get loose
'Cause I'm so lost I don't know what to do
Yeah, I'm so bad and I'm confused, but I'm still stuck to you, girl

[Joel Madden]
'Cause even when I meet you, yeah I knew I couldn't have you
I knew that I would try, and mess it up, what can I do?
And even when you're gone and all my friends will say I'm crazy
Say it ain't right, I want you to have my baby

Oh, Shoulda let you go x3
Let you go

But if I walked away, I know you'd come crawling back
You're playing hard to get, and I know it's all just an act
'Cause even when I meet you, yeah I knew I couldn't have you
I knew that I would try, and mess it up, what can I do?
And even when you're gone and all my friends will say I'm crazy
Say it ain't right, I want you to have my baby

Oh, Shoulda let you go x3
Let you go

Let you go go go go
Tuning in the latest star
From the dashboard of my car
Cruisin' at seven
Push button heaven
Capturing memories from afar
In my car
That's why God made the radio
So tune right in, everywhere you go
He waved His hand, gave us rock 'n roll
The soundtrack of falling in love
That's why God made the radio
Feel the music in the air
Find a song to take us there
It's paradise when I lift up my antenna
Receiving your signal like a prayer
Like a prayer
That's why God made the radio
So tune right in, everywhere you go
He waved His hand, gave us rock 'n roll
The soundtrack of falling in love
That's why God made the radio
Making this night a celebration
Spreading the love and sunshine
To a whole new generation
Whole new generation
That's why God made
That's why God made
That's why God made the radio
That's why God made (the radio)
That's why God made
That's why God made the radio (for fallin' in love)
That's why God made (the radio)
That's why God made
That's why God made the radio
That's why God made (the radio)
That's why God made (God made)
That's why God made the radio (for fallin' in love)

Moses come ridin' up on a quasar
His spurs were jingling, the door was ajar
His buckle was silver, his manner was bold
Asked him to come in out of the cold

His brain was boiling, his reason was spent
His motto is nothing is borrowed, nothing is lent
He asked me for mercy, I gave him a gun
Now and I didn't need these things, it's just got to be done

Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence
You'd get right to work if you had any sense
You know the one thing we need is a left-hand monkey wrench

[Instrumental break]

Gideon come up with his eyes on the floor
Said, "You ain't got a hinge, you can't close the door"
Moses stood up, a full six-foot-ten
Said, "You can't close the door when the wall's caved in"
Ask him for water, he poured me some wine
We finished the bottle and broke into mine
You get what you come for, you're ready to go
Well, it's one in ten thousand that come for the show

Abraham and Isaac diggin' on a well
Mama came quick with the water witch spell
Well cool clear water well you can't ever tell

[Instrumental break]

Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence
You'd get right to work if you had any sense
You know the one thing we need is a left-hand monkey wrench

[Outro dialogue]
It's automatic when I
Talk with old friends
The conversation turns to
Girls we knew when their
Hair was soft and long and the
Beach was the place to go
Suntanned bodies and
Waves of sunshine the
California girls and a
Beautiful coastline
Warmed up weather
Let's get together and
Do it again
With a girl the lonely sea looks good
Makes your night times warm and out of sight
Been so long
(Hey now hey now hey now hey now hey now)
(Hey now hey now hey now hey now hey now)
Well I've been thinking 'bout
All the places we've surfed and danced and
All the faces we've missed so let's get
Back together and do it again
Ow!
Yeah nigga, MC Ren up in this motherfucker
(West West y'all)
Yeah, L.A. niggas
L.A. niggas rule the world nigga
Y'all niggas gotta recognize, yaknahmsayin?
Niggas don't wanna peep game, yaknahmsayin?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre, droppin' heat box on y'all bitch-ass
Yaknahmsayin? You gotta recognize
L.A. niggas, connected all over the motherfucking world, nigga
Recognize this; peep game

Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' til we threw up (threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin Disciples to the Hoover
I'm coming "Straight Outta Compton" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick {*BOOM*}
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sunup -- clown and run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!

Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my max crew, at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain, C.K. B.K
Blue'd up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get, jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai, drive-bys, six-fo's on switches
I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself

Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'
And brew's by the case
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings wit Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!
In L.A

That's how we ride
I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it
God only knows what I'd be without you
If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would livin' do me
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would livin' do me
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
Lady Love sure smiled on me
When she blessed me with your lovin' charms
I found my place in the sun
Sweet heaven here in your arms
I'm so lucky baby, so lucky
Honey, lucky to be loved by you
And I thank you baby
For all the loving things you do
I gotta tell the world about it
I wanna stand right up and shout it Well lucky me
Well lucky, lucky me, ooh baby

I don't mind stormy weather
For there ain't no wrong that makes me blue
And I don't mind if my friends get together
And leave me out of everything, everything they do
It's alright baby, if the sun don't shine
It's impossible to darken my day
'Cause it doesn't matter to me if I don't get there
For I'll be wealthy anyway
Because I know you belong to me
Well I know baby as long as I got you
Oh lucky me, baby, lucky me, baby
In my life there's no misfortune
No trouble knocks down my way
You're my girl, my guiding star
Just your smile can chase my blues away
I can't help it baby, you're so wonderful
How lucky can one man be
Oh when you hold me in your sweet embrace
And they all belong to me
I gotta tell the world about it
Honey, I'm gonna stand right up and shout it
Oh lucky me, baby, lucky lucky me
Oh I've been blessed with you baby
Lucky lucky me
Baby, listen, heaven sent you my way
Oh, lucky lucky me, baby, baby
Honey, honey, I've been blessed, yeah
By your lucky charms...

[Johnny Cash]
I hear the train a comin'
It's rollin' 'round the bend
I ain't seen the sunshine
Since, I don't know when
Lord, I'm stuck in Folsom Prison
And time keeps draggin' on
And that train keeps a-rollin'
On down to San...

[Spoken: Johnny Cash]
Let's give her a big hand, June Carter

[The Carter Family]
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine
I walk the line

[The Statler Brothers]
I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
I went down, down, down
And the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire

[Carl Perkins]
Well when I was just a baby
My Mama told me, "Son
That I want you to be a good boy
I don't want you to play with guns,"
But I shot a man in Reno
I shot him just to watch him die, Lord he dead
Now that train keeps rollin'
I hang my head down and cry

Johnny Yuma was a rebel
He roamed through the west
And Johnny Yuma, the rebel
He wandered alone

He got fightin' mad
This rebel lad
He packed no star
As he wandered far
Where the only law
Was a hook and a draw
The rebel, Johnny Yuma

I want to thank you, for being so good to us
I'd like to say a special hello to all the men here in the prison
That are not with us tonight
That they couldn't, find a key to the door or something
They couldn't let a bunch of them out here
I wish everyone of you could have been out here with us
All you guys
I understand they're piping the show into your cells or somewhere
That's supposed to be listening, or maybe
It's not closed circuit television that you have in here is it?
Anyway, hello to all you fellas who can't be here
We wish you could have all been here
We have had a ball, have we not?
Well, if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little
Farther down the line
Far from Folsom Prison
That's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle
Blow my blues away

[Spoken: Johnny Cash]
Johnny Cash, and the Tennessee three
Carl Perkins, the Carter Family, the Statler Brothers
Johnny Cash

Johnny Cash

Thank you very much, good night
Bow bow bow bow oop
Ahh ooo oohh waaa oooo
Bow bow bow bow oop
Ahh ooo oohh waaa oooo
The other night they were playing our song
Hadn't heard it for oh so long
Took me back darlin' to that time in my car
When you cried all night cause we'd gone too far
Can I ever getcha back
Getcha back baby
Gonna getcha back getcha back
Getcha back getcha back baby
Gonna getcha back getcha back
Can I ever getcha back
I'm getting tired laying around here at night
Thinkin' 'bout some other guy holding you tight
He may have money and a brand new car
May even treat you like a movie star
And no matter what he ever do for you
He can never love you like I can do
So if I leave her and you leave him
Can we ever get it back again
Getcha back getcha back baby
Gonna getcha back getcha back
Getcha back getcha back baby
Gonna getcha back getcha back
Can I ever getcha back
Bow bow bow oop
Bow bow bow oop

[Verse 1]
Feel I'm going back
To Massachusetts
Something's telling me
I must go home

[Chorus]
And the lights all went out down in Massachusetts
The day I left
Her standing on her own

[Verse 2]
Tried to hitch a ride
To San Francisco
Gotta do the things
I wanna do

[Chorus 2]
And the lights all went down in Massachusetts
They brought me back
To see my way with you

[Verse 3]
Talk about the life
In Massachusetts
Speak about the people
I have seen

[Chorus 3]
And the lights all went down in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts
Is one place I have seen

[Outro]
(I will remember Massachusetts)
I will remember Massachusetts
(I will remember Massachusetts)
I will remember Massachusetts
(I will remember Massachusetts)
I will remember Massachusetts
Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together
Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through
Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never ending
Wouldn't it be nice?
Maybe if we think, and wish, and hope, and pray, it might come true
Baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married
And then we'd be happy
Wouldn't it be nice?
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
Wouldn't it be nice?
Flyin' high in the friendly sky
Without leavin' the ground
Rest of the folks are tired and weary
And have laid their bodies down
I go to the place
Where danger waits
And it's bound to
Forsake me
So stupid minded
But I go crazy when I can't find it
In the mornin'
I'll be alright my friends
Soon the night will
Bring the pains again
Ooh, flyin' hight in the friendly sky
Without ever leavin' the ground
Ain't seen nothin' but trouble baby
Paraphernalia is my name
There's a place
Where the feelin' awaits me
Self-destruction's
In my hands
So stupid minded
But I go crazy when I can't find it
I know
I'm hooked my friends
To the boy
Who makes slaves out of men
I did the best I could
Nobody understood
I did the best I could
Nobody understood
I did the best I could
Nobody understood
On my way to sunny California
On my way to spend another sunny day
Water, water
Get yourself in the cool, clear, water
The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place
The sun shines brightly down on the bay
The air's so clean, it'll just take your mind away
Take your mind away
Take your mind away
Have you ever been south of Monterey?
Barrancas carve the coast line
And in the chaparral flows to the sea
'Neath waves of golden sunshine
And have you ever been north of Morro Bay
The south coast plows the sea
And the people there are of the breed
They don't need electricity
Water, water
Cool cascades of clear, clear water
The sun dance final scene sets the hills ablaze
Horizon edges quick up the mountain's way
Have you ever been down Salina's way?
Where Steinbeck found the valley
And he wrote about it the way it was
In his travelin's with Charlie
And have you ever walked down through the sycamores
Where the farmhouse used to be
There the monarch's autumn journey ends
On a windswept Cyprus tree
Water, water
Get yourself in that cool, clear, water
The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place
The air's so clean that it just takes your mind away
Take your mind away
Take your mind away
Have you ever been to a festival
The Big Sur congregation?
Where country Joe will do his show
And he'd sing about liberty
And the people there in the open air
One big family
Yeah, the people there love to sing and share
Their new found liberty
Father stop criticizing your son
Mother please leave your daughters alone
Don't you see that's what wrong
With the world with world today

Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay

We all talked about Candice
But it's only, only a word, truly
Brother turned on a sister in this cruel, cruel world
That's what's wrong with all in this world today

Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
Oh, everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay

Somebody to play with
Wanna to mold you, mold you
Shake your love baby
Wanna to do their thing
Children are told
To give and not just to take
If we were all children
You know the world will be a better place

Oh, everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay

We should all love each other
Love and take one another
We should love each other
Love and not hate, oh

Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay

Truly everybody wants somebody
To mold them, shape them own way
Everybody wants somebody
Try to make it or, do their, do their thing

Everybody wants to take somebody
Got to make it, make it do their thing
Everybody wants somebody
To be their own piece of clay, yeah
Somebody, somebody
Own piece of clay

Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody
Somebody, somebody, somebody
If every word I said
Could make you laugh
I'd talk forever (together my love)
I ask the sky just what we had
Mmm It shone forever (together my love my my my my my my my my my my my
My my)
If the song I sing to you
Could fill your heart with joy
I'd sing forever (together my love my my my my)
Forever
Forever
I've been so happy loving you
Do do do do do do do do do together my love
Let the love I have for you
Live in your heart
And beat forever (together my love)
Forever
Forever
I've been so happy loving you
Baby just let me sing it my baby
I want to be singin' my baby
Baby baby baby my baby
I want to be singin'
I want to be singin' my baby
Oh oh oh oh
My my my my my my
So I'm goin' away
Mmm but not forever
Na na na na
I gotta love you anyway
Forever
Remember me the one who heard your cries
And reached out and dried your eyes

Remember me the one who found you and wrapped all my love around you
When you were all alone and all your dreams were gone
When you were nothing but a tear stained face I took you in
Know your broken wing has mended and your need for me has ended
Know you say you must be free
You wanna fly away from me
You were lost in yesterday I gave you my tomorrow
Know your leaving me in sorrow and you telling me: "im sorry" but baby

Sorry is a sorry word after all I've done for you
Sorry is a sorry word when I need a love that's true

Out of sympathy and all you feel for me
After all the sweet love I've given you (given you baby)
Girl you walk away with the best of me
The love I gave to you, you given to someone new
And sorry won't ease this misery
Remember me who took the hand, held it up to make a stand
Remember me the one who's love has shared, with one who really cares

Now you've turned away from me and say that you sorry
That it had to be baby sorry it had to be that way

Sorry is a sorry word after all I've done for you
Sorry is a sorry word when I need a love that's true
Sorry is a sorry word when I need a love that's true
La la la la la la, La la la la la la

My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour, distant as a Milky Way
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine

In the café or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never noticed me
My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine

La la la la la la, La la la la la la
La la la la la la, La la la la la la

Maybe someday, you'll see my face among the crowd
Maybe someday, I'll share your little distant cloud
Oh, cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
La la la la la la, La la la la la la
La la la la la la, La la la la la la

We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me
Discovering you

One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

[Chorus]
Your body Is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)
Your body Is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and
Though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

You want love?
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

[Chorus]
Damn, baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine all mine all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes

[Chorus]
Your body is a wonderland
There are stars in the Southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the Seven Bridges Road
Now, I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child
And I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild
Sometimes there's a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Running like a child from these warm stars
Down the Seven Bridges Road
There are stars in the Southern sky
And if ever you decide you should go
There is a taste of thyme-sweetened honey
Down the Seven Bridges Road
I'm gonna hold on
Hold on to your unchanging love
I'm gonna hold on
Hold on to your unchanging love
I need ya baby
Baby, I need you right now
Darling, there comes a time in everybody's life
They may learn as I've learned
That being loved is more important
Than paintin' the town, morning, noon and night
'Cause night life may have bright lights
But I've learned in time, they go dim
But your love and tender arms
I can always come home to them
And I'm gonna hold on
Hold on to your unchanging love
I'm gonna hold on
Hold on to your unchanging love
I need ya baby
Baby, I need you right now
I used to have more friends
That I can count
But now all of my so called friends are gone
Since I lost everything in my bank account
Darling, I'm tired of running 'round
So in your arms I'm gonna settle down
'Cause if I don't have a dime
I know your love is mine
And I'm gonna hold on
Hold on to your unchanging love
Hey, said I'm gonna hold on, hold on to
Your unchanging love
I need ya baby
Baby, I need you right now
Darling, everybody needs somebody too
I need you, I know now
Nobody really loves me
Honey, honey, honey, the way you do
One more thing, I've changed girls in my life
As often as I changed my suit
Only to learn the only true happiness
Is being, honey, being loved by you
That's why I'm gonna hold on
Hold on to your unchanging love
I'm gonna hold on
Baby, to your unchanging love
So messed up, I want you here
In my room, I want you here
Now we're gonna be face-to-face
And I'll lay right down in my favorite place

And now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Well come on

Now I'm ready to close my eyes
And now I'm ready to close my mind
And now I'm ready to feel your hand
And lose my heart on the burning sand

And now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog

Well come on
Woo
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Is that the stars in the sky, or is it
Rain falling down
Will it burn me if I touch the sun, yeah
So big, so round
Would I be truthful, yeah, in
Choosing you as the one for me?
Is this love, baby
Or is it just confusion?

[Verse 2]
My mind is so messed up
Going round and round
Must there be all these colours
Without names, without sound, baby?
My heart burns with feeling, but
Whoa my mind, it's cold and reeling
Is this love, baby
Or is it just confusion?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Oh my head is pounding, pounding
Going round and round and round and round
Must there always be these colours
Without names, without sound?
My heart burns with feeling
Oh but my mind, it's cold and reeling
Is this love, baby
Or is it just confusion?

[Outro]
Oh, tell me baby
Is this love or confusion?
Mama, we must get together and find out
Exactly what we're trying to do
Love or confusion?
Confusion
It's getting better all the time

I used to get mad at my school
(No, I can't complain)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool
(No, I can't complain)
You're holding me down, turnin' around
Feeling me up with your rules

I've got to admit, it's getting better
(Better)
A little better all the time
(No, I can't complain)
I have to admit, it's getting better
(Better)
A little better since you've been mine

I used to be an angry young man
Be hiding my head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can, yeah
I've got to admit, it's getting better
(Better)
A little better all the time
(No, I can't complain)
I have to admit, it's getting better
(Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine

Getting so much better all the time
(It's getting better all the time)
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)

I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can (ooh)

I, I have to admit it's getting better
(Better)
A little better all the time
(No, I can't complain)
You're stressed, I admit it's getting better
(Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time
Look at us baby up all night
Tearing our love apart
Aren't we the same two people who live
Through years in the dark?
Ahh...
Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
And I can't tell you why

When we get crazy
It just ain't to right
(Try to keep you head little girl)
Girl I get lonely too
You don't have to worry
Just hold on tight
(Don't get caught in your little world)
Cause I love you
Nothing's wrong as far as I can see
We make it harder than it has to be
And I can't tell you why
No, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
No, no, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
Mama told me when I was young
"Come sit beside me, my only son
And listen closely to what I say
And if you do this it'll help you some sunny day"
"Oh, take your time, don't live too fast
Troubles will come and they will pass
You'll find a woman and you'll find love
And don't forget, son, there is someone up above"
"And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me, son, if you can"
"Forget your lust for the rich man's gold
All that you need is in your soul
And you can do this, oh baby, if you try
All that I want for you, my son, is to be satisfied"
"And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me, son, if you can"
Oh yes, I will
"Boy, don't you worry, you'll find yourself
Follow your heart and nothing else
And you can do this, oh baby, if you try
All that I want for you, my son, is to be satisfied"
"And be a simple kind of man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me, son, if you can"
Baby, be a simple, really simple man
Oh, be something you love and understand
Don't know why Tori came by
I could see by the look in her eyes
Tori'd been driving around the town for awhile
Playing with the thought of leaving
Don't know why Tori just smiled
Mentioned something 'bout how you were right
Must have been hard to see through the tears she was hiding
She said, "I might not be seeing him soon
I got a few things I've been waiting to do"
Hey, Tori came by, Tori came by tonight
Hey, Tori came by, she says to say goodbye
Looked outside at the car in the drive
And the suitcase on the backseat inside
Sure it's so, she can't look out behind at the road
She said, "I might not be seein him soon
I've got a few things I've been waiting to do"
Hey, Tori came by, Tori came by tonight
Hey, Tori came by, she says to say goodbye
Don't look down, she seemed alright
You might be asking where is Tori tonight
Somewhere out on the highway, I'm sure that she's fine
I'm gonna move, baby, way out on the outskirts of town
I'm gonna move way out on the outskirts of town
I don't want nobody who's always hanging around

I'm gonna tell you baby, we're gonna move away from here
I don't want no ice man, I'm gonna get me a frigidaire
When we move way out on the outskirts of town
I don't want nobody who's always hanging around

I'm gonna bring my own groceries, gonna bring them everyday
That'll stop the grocery boy, and keep him away

When we move way out on the outskirts of town
I don't need nobody always hanging around
It may seem funny honey, as funny as funny can be
But if we have any children, I want them all to look like me
When we move way out on the outskirts of town
I don't want nobody always hanging around
Make me feel like paradise
Give me what I'm missing
Send me to the highest heights
Take me up and away
I've tasted love so many times
With something always missing
But I know that you got the kind
Take me up and away
I know that our journey
Will be filled with passion, love and pleasure
Touching down where only
Satisfaction's guaranteed
We won't let our feelings
Auto pilot perfect navigation
Sending us to love bliss
Like no one ever knew could be
Make me feel like paradise
Fill me with your kisses
Make the moment feel just right
Take me up and away
'Cause I have waited all my life
For the one worth giving
And I don't have to think it twice
Let's go up and away, come on baby
Love light in flight
Fuel injection passion
Love light in flight
Fuel injection passion
We need just to feel it
To know that our loving has the power
Showing that these feelings
Emanate from you and me
With love high aviation
We will fly forever in one hour
Giving us the always
To live out all our fantasies
Make me feel like paradise
Give me what I'm missing, yeah
Send me to the highest heights
Take me up and away
I've tasted love so many times
With something always missing, yeah
But I know that you got the kind
To take me up and away, yeah
Love's light in flight
Fuel injection passion
Love's light in flight
Fuel injection passion
Love's light in flight
Fuel injection passion
Love's light in flight
Fuel injection passion
Love's light in flight
Fuel injection passion
Love's light in flight
Fuel injection passion
Make me feel like paradise
All the gold in all the world
Is nothing to possess
If all the things that it can bring
Can't add up to one ounce of your happiness

And for your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there

A diamond that shines
Like a star in the sky
Is nothing to behold
For miniscule is any light
If it can't like you brighten up my soul

And for your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there
I could have never fathomed this
Such joy, love and tenderness
That you give to me
For the love I feel inside
It's so wonderful I can't hide
And I glow, I glow
With just the thought of you
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

And for your love
I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love
I would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there

(repeat 3 times)
To be the last to leave the last to be gone
Stolen from the ones who held onto it
To be the last in line oh the ones that live on
Silhouette of a dream treasured by the ones
Who hung on to it
Almost a breakdown of our love affair
The stiletto cuts quick like a whip through the air
Long distance winners will we survive the flight
Not one of us runs from the fire light
I would love to believe, I believe what you say
In the drama of the moment
Oh no there is no easy way, no one ever leaves
Everyone stays close 'till the fire fades
I would love to believe, I believe what you say
In the drama of the moment
For us there is no easy way, no one ever leaves
Everyone stays close 'till the fire fades
To be the last to leave what caused the fearsome
Divorce in the night there was no competition
Well to survive do it right and you believe in the five
To survive the distance everyone fights
Everyone fights and the fire flies
What happened to my feelings
When heartbreak comes in the night
Some call it my nightmare my five fireflies
Well like a sailing ship on one of love's rocks, no one
Of our love affair like a whip through the air
I would love to believe, I believe what you say
Fireflies

[Intro]
When you love me like that
When you love me like that

[Verse 1]
My beautiful lover
I still remember
We used to be young once
I loved you even then
I wanted to tell you
But I was just a little girl, mhm
But now you are mine, and
It's like we both have been
On Fantasy Island, together once gain
As long as you're where I am
There's nowhere better in the world

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh honey, honey, hold me tight
Make me believe in love tonight
And in the morning
Wake me up while you whisper
Sweet words that I love

[Chorus]
You turn me out, you turn me out
When you love me like that
You make a believer I have no doubt
(When you love me like that)
The things that you do with love
I could never give it up
(I just couldn't give it up)

[Verse 2]
The things that excite me
You seem to know them all
You really must like me
'Cause every time you call
You never stop saying
The prettiest of pretty words
Sugar, honey, sweetie, baby
You always know just what to say when I'm afraid
You take me and hold me (Honey) and chase the blues away
And then you tell me the sweetest things I've ever heard

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, no, no one loves like you
I dream about us all night through
And in the morning when we rise
I know that look of love's there in your eyes

[Chorus]
Turn me out, you turn me out
When you love me like that
You make a believer I have no doubt
(When you love me like that)
The things that you do with love
I could never give it up
(I just couldn't give it up)
When you love, when you love, when you love
(When you love me like that)
Couldn't give it up, boy
(When you love me like that)
Calling your name
Ooh, when you love, when you love, when you love
When you love me like that
I could never
(I just couldn't give it up)
Never never never never

[Outro]
Down on my knees for your love, boy
When you love me like that
When you love me like that
When you love me like that
Oh, when you love me like that
I couldn't stand it, I could never live without it
I just couldn't give it up
When you love, when you love, when you love
When you love me like that
Ooh baby
When you love me like that
Never, never, never, never give it up
I just couldn't give it up
Go!
I'm gonna wake you up early cause I'm gonna take a ride with you
We're goin' down to the Honda shop, I'll tell you what we're gonna do
Put on a ragged sweatshirt, I'll take you anywhere you want me to

[Chorus:]
First gear, it's all right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Second gear, I'll lean right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Third gear, hang on tight (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)
Faster, it's all right
It's not a big motorcycle
Just a groovy little motorbike
It's more fun than a barrel of monkeys
That two-wheeled bike
We'll ride on out of the town
To anyplace I know you like

[Chorus]
It climbs the hills like a Matchless
Cause my Honda' built really light
When I go in to the turns
Better hang on tight
I'd better turn on the lights
So we can ride my Honda tonight

[Chorus]
{Intro}
Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?
All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?
She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
{Added in later versions -
Once in a million years a lady like her rises
Oh no, Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone
Your life knows no answer, your life knows no answer}
All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
She rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?
All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?

Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind
Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind
Well, it was twenty years ago today
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So let me I introduce to you
The band you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's wonderful to be here, it's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home
I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought that you might like to know
That the singer's gonna sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
But let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you have enjoyed the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're sorry but it's time to go
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We like to thank you once again
Sgt. Pepper's one and only Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's getting very near the end
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Verse 1]
Down the street you can hear her scream "You're a disgrace"
As she slams the door in his drunken face
And now he stands outside
And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool
He cries "Oh girl, you must be mad
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"
Against the door he leans and starts a scene
And his tears fall and burn the garden green

[Chorus]
And so castles made of sand
Fall in the sea eventually

[Verse 2]
A little Indian brave who before he was ten
Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends
And he built a dream that when he grew up
He would be a fearless warrior, Indian Chief
Many moons passed, and more the dream grew strong
Until tomorrow he would sing his first war song
And fight his first battle
But something went wrong
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night

[Chorus]
And so castles made of sand
Melts into the sea eventually

[Verse 3]
There was a young girl whose heart was a frown
'Cause she was crippled for life and she couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she could stop living
So she decided to die
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore
And to her legs she smiled, "You won't hurt me no more"
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
"Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way"
And it really didn't have to stop
It just kept on going

[Outro]
And so castles made of sand
Slips into the sea eventually

[will.i.am]
I've been holding out so long
I've been sleeping all alone
Lord, I miss you
I've been hanging on the phone
I've been sleeping all alone
I want to kiss you

[All]
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

[will.i.am]
Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been starring in my dreams
Lord, I miss you
I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings
It's just some friends of mine that say

[will.i.am]
"Hey, what's the matter man?
We're gonna come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls that's just dyin' to meet you"
"We're gonna bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around
You know, like we used to"

[Fergie]
Oh, everybody waits so long
Oh baby, why you wait so long?
Won't you come home, come home?

[All]
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

[apl.de.ap]

[Taboo]

[Fergie]
I've been walking Central Park
Singing after dark
People think I'm crazy
Stumbling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
Ask me people, "What's the matter with you boy?"

[All]
"What's the matter with you boy?"

[All]
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah
Well, blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Well, blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Well, it was on one moonlight night
Where the stars shining bright
Wind blowin' high, my love said goodbye
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Well, it was on one moonlight night
With the stars shining bright
Wind blowin' high, my love said goodbye
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Well, blue moon, blue moon, blue moon, keep shining bright
Well, blue moon, keep on shining bright
Bring me back my baby tonight
Blue moon, yeah, keep shining bright
Well l say, blue moon of Kentucky just keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Well blue moon of Kentucky is to keep on shining
Yeah, shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Well, it was on one moonlight night
With the stars shining bright
Wind blowin' high, my love said goodbye
Blue moon of Kentucky to keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Yeah, shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

[Intro]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Refrain]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats that you meet on the streets speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they gotta get goin'
Out of the door and down on the street all alone

[Refrain]
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine
All her friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Refrain]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Refrain]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin', you wanna settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'm goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Too many shadows in my room
Too many hours in this midnight
Too many corners in my mind
So much to do to set my heart right
Oh, it's taking so long
I could be wrong, I could be ready
Oh but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair
Stood on the corner for a while
To wait for the wind to blow down on me
Hoping it takes with it my old ways
And brings some brand new luck upon me
Oh, it's taking so long
I could be wrong, I could be ready
Oh but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair
And now I'm walking in the park
And all of the birds, they dance below me
Maybe when things turn green again
It will be good to say you know me
Oh, it's taking so long
I could be wrong, I could be ready
Oh but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unready
Oh, yeah, I'm never really ready
Oh, I'm never really ready
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there

I was born a travellin' man, that's all I'll ever be
Moving around from town to town, it's what makes me so free
My father was a trucker for the years since '23
On the day that I was born his blood was left to me

I'm the travellin' man
Travellin' man, that's what I am
Travellin' man
Travellin' man, that's what I am

Travellin' man, that's what I am, no one puts a hold on me
You'll see me once or maybe twice, that's all you'll see of me
All you pretty women Lord, I hope you understand
Don't be a fool and fall in love, put your heart in a travellin' man

I'm the travellin' man
Travellin' man
Travellin' man
Travellin' man

Travellin' man, that's what I am
Guess I'll always be
Travellin' man, that's what I am
But at least I am free
I'm a traveller
Travellin' man
Oh, that's what I am

Travellin man, that's what I am, Lord, I move so fast
I have had so many women, none of them have last
I am just a mover, movin' fast as sound
Always free, sometimes lonely, always movin' around

I'm the travellin' man
Travellin' man
Travellin' man
Travellin' man
Oh, that's what I am
Travellin' man
I've got the key to the highway
Billed out and bound to go
Gonna leave here runnin'
Walkin's most too slow
I'm goin' back to the border
Baby, where I'm better known
Because you haven't done nothin', baby
But drive a good man from home
When the moon beats on the mountain
Little girl, I'll be on my way
I'm gonna roam this highway
Until the break of day
Oh, give me one more kiss darlin'
Just before I go
'Cos when I leave this time, little girl
I won't be back no more
I got the key
(I got the key)
To the highway
(To the highway)
Billed out and bound to go
(I gotta go, I gotta go)
I'm gonna leave here runnin'
Walkin's most too slow

[Verse 1]
Well, I wait around the train station
Waitin' for that train
Waitin' for the train, yeah
Take me home, yeah
From this lonesome place
Well, now a while lotta people put me down a lotta changes
My girl had called me a disgrace
Dig
The tears burnin'
Tears burnin' me
Tears burnin' me
Way down in my heart
Well, you know it's too bad, little girl
It's too bad

[Verse 2]
Too bad we have to part (have to part)

That's what I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
What I'm gonna do
When some loud braggart tries to put me down
And says his school is great
I tell him right away
"Now what's the matter buddy
Ain't you heard of my school
It's number one in the state"
(Hey hey take it away, let's call it fight???)
So be true to your school

I've got things to do
I move everyday
I hope you don't mind
'Cause I'm goin' your way
You've got things to do
You move everyday
I hope you don't mind
'Cause I'm coming your way
You've got things to do
You move everyday
I hope you don't mind
'Cause I'm coming your way
I've got things to do
I move everyday
I hope you don't mind
'Cause I'm coming your way
Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong

You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never ending
Wouldn't it be nice?

Maybe if we think, and wish, and hope, and pray, it might come true
Baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married
And then we'd be happy
(Sleep tight oh baby goodnight
Ooh baby sleep tight oh baby)

Wouldn't it be nice?
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
Wouldn't it be nice?
Left my home in Norfolk, Virginia, California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh, and on across Caroline
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill, and we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown, rollin' 'cross the Georgia state
Had motor trouble it turned into a struggle, halfway 'cross Alabam'
The 'hound broke down left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham, woo

Straight off bought me a through train ticket, right across Mississippi clean
And I was on the midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
People are there who care a little 'bout me
They won't let the poor boy down

Sure as she you're born, she bought me a silk suit, put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
The pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We'd be headin' in the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines, cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four ten oh nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land callin'
And the poor boy's on the line

[Intro]
Duh dah duh dah duh dah duh duh dah duh

[Verse 1]
One of these days when my heart gets strong enough
Gonna pack my clothes and walk out of the door
And on that day, when I up and leave you
You can beat your life that I won't be back no more
Sang-a-song like duh dah duh dah
Duh dah duh dah duh dah duh duh dah duh

[Verse 2]
I know that I'm just a fool for you
Nobody has to tell me the way I am
It's the way I feel that make a difference
You see I love you so much that I don't care how I am

[Bridge]
Hey now, what are you supposed to do
When you find out your love was untrue
Hey now, just have to stay
'Cause I don't have enough left to walk away

[Verse 4]
One of these days when my heart gets strong enough
Gonna pack my clothes and walk out of the door
Until that day, when I get my self together
I'm gonna stay right here, baby come with me

[Intro]
Baby, ooh
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm giving in to you
Giving in 'cause I love you, ooh ooh
Take my love, take it all
Put your trust in this cause

[Chorus]
'Cause I will love you, baby
Yeah, I really love you, babe
Yeah, yeah, I really love you

[Verse 2]
I'm giving everything I own
Take it all, honey, take me home
Giving when I can, I ain't holding back

[Chorus]
I will love you
Yeah, I really love you, baby
Yeah, yeah, I really love you

[Verse 3]
Take as much of my love, boy
To your heart's delight
I'll give it to you nice, day and night
Give you what I think you never really had
'Cause this here girl's love is truly bad

[Chorus]
And I will love you, baby
Yeah, I really love you, baby
Yeah, yeah, I really love you

[Break]

[Chorus]
I really love you, yeah
I really love you, baby
Yeah, yeah, I really love you

[Bridge]

Very lovely, very fine
It's like paradise
So what else can I do?
I'm giving in
In to you

[Outro]
Giving in to you
Giving in 'cause I love you
You're so sweet

Got to give in once

Oh baby, as the bitter tears fall from your eyes
Oh, a thousand times you ask yourself why
The one guy you loved has departed
Oh, you're left alone and brokenhearted
Love just comes and it goes
How long it's gonna' last
Said nobody knows
That's the way, love is baby
(That's the way love is, sho' 'nuff how it is)
Oh, that's the way, love is sugar
(That's the way love is, sho' 'nuff how it is)
That's how it is
Oh, that's how it is my little darlin'
Yeah now, I know you walkin' down a lonesome road
And your heart is carryin' a heavy load
I know you feel like you ain't got a friend
(Feel like you ain't got a friend)
Oh, and your whole world is cavin' in
(Whole world is cavin' in)
Oh but now is the time to be strong
(Now is the time to be strong)
You've gotta' forget him now that he's gone
(Forget him now that he's gone)
And remember, that's the way, love is honey
(That's the way love is, sho' 'nuff how it is)
That's the way, love is baby
(That's the way love is, sho' 'nuff how it is)
That's how it is
Oh oh, my little darlin'
Oh baby
Oh, listen to me little darlin'
The road of love gets rough sometimes
Don't let it get the best of you
Said I've been hurt by love so many times
(Been hurt by love so many times)
So I know just what you're goin' through
(Know just what you're goin' through)
You wish that you were never born
(Wish that you were never born)
You've got to forget him, now that he's gone
(Forget him, now that he's gone)
Just remember
That's the way, love is baby
(That's the way love is, sho' 'nuff how it is)
Oh, that's the way, love is honey
(That's the way love is, sho' 'nuff how it is)
That's how it is
So wipe away your tears
Love is here today, and gone tomorrow
(That's the way love is, sho' 'nuff how it is)
I say all of your joys turn to sorrows
(That's the way love is, sho' 'nuff how it is)
One day gladness and the next day sadness
(That's the way love is, sho' 'nuff how it is)
Oh, that's the way, love is baby
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do birds sing so gay?
Lover's awake at the break of day
Why do they fall in love?
Why does the rain
Fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?
Why does my heart skip with crazy beats
'Fore I know it will face defeat
Tell me why, why
Why do they fall in love?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do birds sing so gay?
Lover's awake at the break of day
Why do they fall in love?
Why does the rain
Fall from up above?
Why do fools fall in love?
Why do they fall in love?
Tell my why, why
Why do they fall in love?
Tell my why, why
Why do fools fall in love?

[Intro]
Ooo
Ooo

[Verse 1]
Good morn or evening friends
Here's your friendly announcer
I have serious news to pass on to everybody

[Verse 2]
What I'm about to say
Could mean the world's disaster
Could change your joy and laughter to tears and pain

[Chorus]
It's that, love's in need of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
Hate's goin' round breaking many hearts
Stop it please, before it's gone too far

[Post-Chorus]
Ooo (Oh, oh)
Ooo (Oh, ohh)

[Verse 3]
The force of evil plans
To make you its possession
And it will if we let it destroy everybody

[Verse 4]
We all must take precautionary measures
If love and peace you treasure
Then you'll hear me when I say

[Chorus]
Woah, that love's in need of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
Hate's goin' round breaking many hearts
Stop it please, before it's gone too far
People, you know that love's in need of love today
Don't, don't delay, send yours in right away
You know that hate's goin' round, hate's goin' round
Hate's goin' round to try to break as many hearts
You've got to, I've got to, they've go to, we've got to
They've gotta, we gotta, they've gotta give us something
(Oh, don't you know that love)
Love's in need of love today
(Did you repeat, that love would be in need of love)
Don't delay, send yours in right away
Hate's goin' round, bring it down a little
'Cause love is very peaceful, so bring it down a little
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Love's in need of love today
Don't delay, right away
Hate's goin' round, breaking many hearts
Stop it please, gone too far
Love's in need of love today (What the world needs now)
Don't delay (Oh, L-O-V-E, love)
Right away (Oh, L-O-V-E, love)
Hate's goin' round, breaking many hearts
Stop it please, gone too far

[Outro]
Just give the world love
So are you ready?
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Aah, oh, yeah, oh
Listen to me people
I ain't got time to think about money
Or what it can buy
And I ain't got time to sit down and wonder
What makes a birdie fly
And I don't have the time to think about
What makes a flower grow
And I've never given a second thought
To where the rivers flow
Too busy thinking about my baby
And I ain't got time for nothing else
Said, "I ain't got time to discuss the weather
How long it's gonna last
And I ain't got time to do no studies
Once I get out of class"
Tellin' ya I'm just a fellow
Said, "I got a one track mind
And when it comes to thinking about anything but my baby
I just don't have any time"
Too busy thinking about my baby
And I ain't got time for nothing else
Too busy thinking about my baby
And I ain't got time for nothing else
The diamonds and pearls in the world
Could never match her worth, no, no
She's some kind of wonderful, people tell ya
I've got heaven right here on earth
I'm just a fellow
With a one, one track mind
And when it comes to thinkin' about anything but my baby
I just don't have any time
Too busy thinking about my baby
And I ain't got time for nothing else
Too busy thinking about my baby
And I ain't got time for nothing else
Too busy thinking about my baby
Ain't got time for nothing else, no, no, no
Too busy thinking about my baby
Ain't got time for nothing else, no, no, no
Too busy thinking about my baby
When I close my eyes 'cause that's when she appears
I grab her by the thighs and I pull her near
But to my surprise, it is just what I fear
'cause when I turn on the lights there's no one there
I am by myself and I am dancing all alone
I am by myself and I know that nobody's home
I am by myself but I am dancing all alone
I am by myself and I know that nobody's home
There's no one there when I turn on the lights
There's no one there when I turn on the lights
And just like that she's right back
She'll stay the night as long as I play the right track
She likes the lights low
And when she winds slow
I'm buyin' what she's selling
Ain't no telling where my mind goes
She leaves my mind blown like old speakers
She always comes and goes but I never leave her
She's like my favorite cut or replay
She makes them paper cuts go away
I hope she stays
I am by myself and I am dancing all alone
I am by myself and I know that nobody's home
I am by myself but I am dancing all alone
I am by myself and I know that nobody's home
I am by myself and I am dancing all alone
I am by myself and I know that nobody's home
I am by myself but I am dancing all alone
I am by myself and I know that nobody's home
I am by myself and I am dancing all alone
I am by myself and I know that nobody's home
I am by myself but I am dancing all alone
I am by myself and I know that nobody's home
Oh baby, as the bitter tears fall from your eyes
Oh, a thousand times you ask yourself why
The one guy you loved has departed
Oh, you're left alone and brokenhearted
Love just comes and it goes
How long it's gonna' last
Said nobody knows
That's the way, love is baby
(That's the way love is, sho' 'nuff how it is)
Oh, that's the way, love is sugar
(That's the way love is, sho' 'nuff how it is)
That's how it is
Oh, that's how it is my little darlin'
Yeah now, I know you walkin' down a lonesome road
And your heart is carryin' a heavy load
I know you feel like you ain't got a friend
(Feel like you ain't got a friend)
Oh, and your whole world is cavin' in
(Whole world is cavin' in)
Oh but now is the time to be strong
(Now is the time to be strong)
You've gotta' forget him now that he's gone
(Forget him now that he's gone)
And remember, that's the way, love is honey
(That's the way love is, sho' 'nuff how it is)
That's the way, love is baby
(That's the way love is, sho' 'nuff how it is)
That's how it is
Oh oh, my little darlin'
Oh baby
Oh, listen to me little darlin'
The road of love gets rough sometimes
Don't let it get the best of you
Said I've been hurt by love so many times
(Been hurt by love so many times)
So I know just what you're goin' through
(Know just what you're goin' through)
You wish that you were never born
(Wish that you were never born)
You've got to forget him, now that he's gone
(Forget him, now that he's gone)
Just remember
That's the way, love is baby
(That's the way love is, sho' 'nuff how it is)
Oh, that's the way, love is honey
(That's the way love is, sho' 'nuff how it is)
That's how it is
So wipe away your tears
Love is here today, and gone tomorrow
(That's the way love is, sho' 'nuff how it is)
I say all of your joys turn to sorrows
(That's the way love is, sho' 'nuff how it is)
One day gladness and the next day sadness
(That's the way love is, sho' 'nuff how it is)
Oh, that's the way, love is baby
The girls dig the way
The guys get all wiped out
With their feet in the air
You can hear 'em shout
They're not afraid
(Don't back down, don't back down)
Not my boys
(Don't back down, don't back down)
They grit their teeth, they don't back down
(Don't back down)
You gotta be a little nuts
(Don't back down)
But show 'em now who's got guts
(Don't back down)
Don't back down from that wave
With their feet full of tar
And their hair full of sand
The boys know the surf
Like the palm of their hand
They're not afraid
(Don't back down, don't back down)
Not my boys
(Don't back down, don't back down)
They grit their teeth, they don't back down
(Don't back down)
You gotta be a little nuts
(Don't back down)
But show 'em now who's got guts
(Don't back down)
Don't back down from that wave
When a twenty footer sneaks up like a ton of lead
And the crest come along and slaps them up side the head
They don't back down
Not my boys
(Don't back down, don't back down)
They grit their teeth, they don't back down
(Don't back down
You gotta be a little nuts
(Don't back down)
But show 'em now who's got guts
(Don't back down)
Don't back down from that wave
Don't back down
Don't back down
Don't back down
Don't back down
You know I have to be honest it's like
For the first time in my life
My pride is not involved

Not afraid to tell you girl that

After all, we were more than friends

Now I beg of you, forgive me
From the bottom of my heart, dear
I apologize
Give me back your glance, give me back romance
Give me one more chance, forgive me
From the bottom of my heart, dear

Well, you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking, but she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag
Dressed in her polythene bag
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl
Who makes the News Of The World
Yes, you could say that she's attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
By the banks of her own lagoon
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though I thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
Although she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
Oh, yeah
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command
He's a real nowhere man, sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

(1,2,3,4)

(Bye!)

We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you have enjoyed the show

Fuckin right I'm hip-hop
I hoe hop, I'm funky as a pair of Reeboks with no socks
I'm hot like a nigga ? the beef to the beers with no brats
I'm tight like them twistin up under the 6 with no top
I've been up all night
Writing like a motherfucker cluck with no clock
Been platinum and I'm still stompin
Rock jam-packed concerts and bitch filled parties
Done had them standin more than a hot comb when I perform
Gotta em feelin like they in Saigon when they hear what I got
I got funk
No Limit legitimate respect the man of power
I turn your motherfuckin thunderstorm into scattered showers
Yo Bam, bitches can't get down
Like me and the Pound can, we ain't gotta bring up SoundScan
I come into focus when they all starin
I turn your fuckin head and, spin your fuckin ball bearings
Hit the antenna so they all scatterin
Believe that cause I'm tellin you
They don't challenge what they can't handle
M-Y-S-T-I
Smoke spinach, eat chicken, shit bullets, SPIT FIRE
I'm above you like the sky
Like the clouds like the Gods like the birds and the pilots
You know why I'm here, come to say it loud
For the one-thousand nine-hundred and nine nine
To infinity and BEYOND
Now.. now.. now.. now.. bitch
Respect my motherfucking mind
Fuck what you feelin, fuck what you think

Y'all done feeling my line before I finish my SENTENCE
This microphone's for holdin

Then that's how fast them niggas get FUCKED OVER
No prisoners at no time
I'm so advanced I put your ass in the blender
With my OWN rhyme, bitch say, "Damn that nigga tight!
I heard what he did to that other rapper that other night
And Dawg that shit wasn't right!"
I'm nothin nice in the shinin lights
No band, no choir, just me and my fucking Nike's
But am I missing something? FUCK NO
I got the whole crowd bucked up, "UH OHHH!"
I smash a rapper into smithereens
Make him spill his beans
Then I'm running with the guillotine
Diss on my rhymes bitch and diss on my records
Diss on my moms bitch you gon' respect it!

There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still we're often told "seek and ye shall find"
So I'm going to seek a certain girl I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found her yet
She's the big affair I cannot forget
Only girl I ever think of will regret
I'd like to add her initial to my monogram
Tell me where's the shepherd for this lost lamb
There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that she turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in a wood
I know I could always be good
To one who'll watch over me
Although she may not the girl some men think of
As handsome to my heart
She carries the key
Won't you tell her please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh how I need
Someone to watch over me
Someone to watch over me
Best of friends never part
Best of fools has loved forever
From the bottom of his heart

So why pretend
This is the end
You'll have to find out for yourself
Go on ask somebody else

Why can't you just get it through your head
It's over, it's over now
Yes, you heard me clearly now I said
It's over, it's over now

I'm not really over you
You might say that
I can't take it, I can't take it
Lord, I swear I just can't take it no more

(Go away) go away
(Far away) so far away
It's too late to turn back now
And it don't matter anyhow
'Cause you were right
I'm to blame
Can't go on the same old way
Can't keep up the same old game

I'm not really over you
You might say that
I can't take it, I can't take it
Lord, I swear I just can't take it no more
He was a hard-headed man
He was brutally handsome, and she was terminally pretty
She held him up, and he held her for ransom in the heart
Of the cold, cold city
He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude
They said he was ruthless, they said he was crude
They had one thing in common, they were
Good in bed
She'd say, "Faster, faster. The lights are turnin' red."
Life in the fast lane
Surely make you lose your mind, mm
Are you with me so far?

Eager for action and hot for the game
The coming attraction, the drop of a name
They knew all the right people, they took
All the right pills
They threw outrageous parties, they paid heavily bills
There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face
She pretended not to notice, she was caught up
In the race
Out every evening, until it was light
He was too tired to make it, she was too tired
To fight about it

Life in the fast lane
Surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, uh huh
Blowin' and burnin', blinded by thirst
They didn't see the stop sign
Took a turn for the worst

She said, "Listen, baby.You can hear the engine
Ring.We've been up and down this highway;
Haven't seen a goddam thing."
He said, "Call the doctor. I think I'm gonna crash."
"The doctor says he's comin', but you gotta pay him in cash."
They went rushin' down that freeway, messed around
And got lost
They didn't care they were just dyin' to get off
And it was life in the fast lane
Life in the fast lane
Back to you
It always comes around
Back to you
I tried to forget you
I tried to stay away
But it's too late

Over you
I'm never over, over you
There's something about you
It's just the way you move
The way you move me

Yeah, I'm so good at forgetting
And I quit every game I play
But forgive me, love
I can't turn and walk away
This way

Back to you
It always comes around
Back to you
I walk with your shadow
I'm sleeping in my bed
With your silhouette
Yeah, should have smiled in that picture
If it's the last that I'll see of you
It's the least that you
Could not do

Leave the light on
I'll never give up on you
Leave the light on
For me too
For me too
For me too
Yeah

Back to me
I know that it comes
Back to me
Doesn't it scare you
Your will is not as strong
As it used to be
I Remember You You're the one who made my dreams Come true A few kisses ago I remember you You're the one who said I love you too Didn't you know And I remember too a distant bell And stars that fell Like rain Out of the blue And when my life is through And the angels ask me To recall The thrill of them all Then I shall tell them I Remember you I remember too a distant bell And stars that fell Like rain Out of the blue And when my life is through And the angels ask me To recall The thrill of them all Then I shall tell them I Remember you

I Remember You
You're the one who made my dreams
Come true
A few kisses ago
I remember you
You're the one who said
I love you too
Didn't you know
And I remember too a distant bell
And stars that fell
Like rain
Out of the blue
And when my life is through
And the angels ask me
To recall
The thrill of them all
Then I shall tell them
I Remember you
I remember too a distant bell
And stars that fell
Like rain
Out of the blue
And when my life is through
And the angels ask me
To recall
The thrill of them all
Then I shall tell them
I Remember you
After it's all been said
The music spinning in our head
Can't forget the feeling of
The magic of that summer in love

Ooh, I wanna take you there
Do you wanna turn back the pages?
Memories and photographs
The world has changed
And yet the game
Is still the same

Isn't it time we danced the night away?
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things we used to do

Remember those nights we spent, just you and I
Little did we know how the time would fly
Isn't it time?
Oh, isn't it time? Woah
The good times never have to end
And now's the time to let them happen again
We can have ourselves a blast
The good times, they aren't only in the past

Isn't it time we danced the night away?
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things we used to do

Remember those nights we spent, just you and I
Little did we know how the time would fly
Isn't it time?
Oh, isn't it time?

And as the sun goes down
We raise a glass to kindness
To all the good times we shared

Isn't it time we get ready again?
Isn't it time we go steady again?

Isn't it time we danced the night away?
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things we used to do
Remember those nights we spent, just you and I
Little did we know how the time would fly
Isn't it time?
Oh, isn't it time?

Isn't it time we danced the night away?
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things we used to do

Remember those nights we spent, just you and I
Little did we know how the time would fly
Isn't it time?
Why , why why why why
Cause I keep bangin' y'all mother-fuckin ass, with this shit
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide
I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
I'm too hip to drip, I do it to 'em like this
I wan't-a load it up, cock back don't miss
Y'all ain't goin' believe this
Got the preacher's wife talkin' bout rock that shit
All they do is say the mans name
You watch how many bitches start comin', it's a damn shame
They know I got the wood for 'em
If they in the hotel room and get the dick, that's good for 'em
Big pussy and it's soft dick time, bitch I got to get'cha, mm-hm, uh-huh
Tell me what you goin' do
If you got your friends with you, you could bring them ho's too
Come and turn around, let me get behind you
Move somethin' for me baby, I ain't goin' tell no body
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide
I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide
I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
I'm too hip to drip
When I'm here they got to have it
White lines so live they jump off the cabinet
It's Micheal Tyler not Black Sabbath
It's springin' hunter so watch out for the cat parrot
I'm a whole and kaniver, the hot enchilada, Big Truck driver
Hittin' hookers is a side high
Tuckin' guts stackin' paper formin' lyrics is my real job
Got my fingers and my shit tight
Got another album and contract bitch get right
Form a crowd like a fist fight
Take my time with it if it takes me sun-up to midnight
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide
I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide
I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
I'm too hip to drip
I'm too man to try to handle, I'm too bad and loaded too for you to hold
Too tight to out-write, too strong to out-sold, too much to out-bust
I'll talk shit and cuss, foul-dog rimp and the walk talk spit crush
The paper towels and toilet tissue, start your engine set the table
Clean your plate and wash the dishes
Can I please get a source cup
And if they don't give me my grammy, feel so sorry for your mother
And after I'm goin' get Jive
I done bust my ass, y'all ain't do y'all job
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide
I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide
I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
I'm too hip to drip
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide
I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide
I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
I'm too hip to drip
Aruba, Jamaica ooo I wanna take you
Bermuda, Bahama come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego baby why don't we go
Jamaica
Off the Florida Keys
There's a place called Kokomo
That's where you wanna go to get away from it all
Bodies in the sand
Tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love
To the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica ooo I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego baby why don't we go
Ooo I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down to Kokomo
To Martinique, that Monserrat mystique
We'll put out to sea
And we'll perfect our chemistry
By and by we'll defy a little bit of gravity
Afternoon delight
Cocktails and moonlit nights
That dreamy look in your eye
Give me a tropical contact high
Way down in Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica ooo I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego baby why don't we go
Ooo I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down to Kokomo
Port Au Prince I wanna catch a glimpse
Everybody knows
A little place like Kokomo
Now if you wanna go
And get away from it all
Go down to Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica ooo I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego baby why don't we go
Ooo I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down to Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica ooo I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego baby why don't we go
Ooo I wanna take you down to Kokomo

[Verse 1]
There's talk on the street
It sounds so familiar
Great expectations
Everybody's watching you
People you meet
They all seem to know you
Even your old friends
Treat you like you're something new

[Chorus]
Johnny-come-lately
The new kid in town
Everybody loves you
So don't let them down

[Verse 2]
You look in her eyes
The music begins to play
Hopeless romantics
Here we go again
But after awhile
You're lookin' the other way
It's those restless hearts
That never mend

[Chorus]
Oh, Johnny-come-lately
The new kid in town
Will she still love you
When you're not around?

[Bridge]
There's so many things
You should have told her
But night after night
You're willing to hold her, just hold her
Tears on your shoulder

[Verse 3]
There's talk on the street
It's there to remind you
That it doesn't really matter
Which side you're on
You're walking away
And they're talking behind you
They will never forget you
'Til somebody new comes along

[Chorus]
Where you've been lately?
There's a new kid in town
Everybody loves him, don't they?
And he's holding her
And you're still around

[Outro]
Oh, my, my
There's a new kid in town
Just another new kid in town
Everybody's talking 'bout
The new kid in town
Everybody's walking like
The new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
I don't want to hear it
There's a new kid in town
I don't want to hear it, ah ooh
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
Everybody's talking
There's a new kid in town
People started walking
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town

[to the audience]
(Clap your hands!)

Well, life on the farm is kinda laid back
Ain't much an old country boy like me can't hack
It's early to rise, early in the sack
I thank God I'm a country boy

Well, a simple kind of life never did me no harm
Raisin' me a family and workin' on the farm
My days are all filled with an easy country charm
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

When the work's all done and the sun's settin' low
I pull out my fiddle and I rosin' up the bow
Kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low
And thank God I'm a country boy
I'd play "Sally Goodin'" all day if I could
But the Lord and my wife wouldn't take it very good
So I fiddle when I can, work when I should
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy, woo-hoo!

Well, I wouldn't trade my life for diamonds or jewels
I never was one of them money hungry fool
Rather have my fiddle and my farmin' tools
Thank God I'm a country boy

Yeah, city folk drivin' in a black limousine
A lotta sad people think that's-a mighty keen
Son, let me tell you now exactly what I mean
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy, yes sir!

Well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he died
And he took me by the hand, held me close to his side
Said, "Live a good life, play my fiddle with pride
And thank God you're a country boy"
Well, my daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle
Taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle
Taught me how to love and how to give just a little
Thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Wooh! Thank God I'm a country boy, yea!

[to the audience]
(John Sommers played the fiddle and he wrote that song!)

[Chorus 1]
Well, I woke up late this morning
My head was in a whirl
Only then I realized
I lost my little girl
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus 2]
Well, her clothes were not expensive
Her hair didn't always curl
I don't know why I love her
But I love my little girl
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Well, gather 'round people
Let me tell you the story
The very first song I wrote
Well, gather 'round people
Let me tell you the story
The very first song I wrote

[Chorus 1]
I woke up late this morning
My head was in a whirl
Only then I realized
I lost my little girl
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I said

Looking out on the morning rain I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I'd have face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
Your love was the key to my peace of mind
'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm livin' for
'Cause if I make you happy I don't need to do more
You make me feel, you make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Oh, baby, what you've done to me
(What you've done to me')
You make me feel so good inside
(Good inside.)
And I just want to be
(Want to be)
Close to you
You make me feel so alive!
You make me feel, you make me feel
You make me feel like a natural, natural woman
You make me feel, you make me feel
You make me feel like a natural natural woman
You make me feel, you make me feel
You make me feel like a natural natural woman

[Intro: Diddy and Mary J. Blige]
Here we go again
Mmm
Yeah
Mmm-mmm
That's right
Mmm-mmm-mmm
Here we go again
Mmm-mmm
Hah, yeah
Mmm-mmm
This is the remix, we back together again
Let's go, Mary, yeah

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
All the love we gave
The lovin' that we made
Then you went away
So, I had to pray
To see a brighter day
'Cause I was led astray
Now I'm moving on to get away from all this pain

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I feel (I feel)
Better than I felt before (So much better)
'Cause theres no more drama knockin' at my door
I feel (No more)
Better than I felt before
'Cause theres no more drama in my life no more

[Post-Chorus: Mary J. Blige and Diddy]
No more
No more
This is the remix
I like this
Come on

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
It's lookin' better now
A brand new love I found
I finally figured out
What love is all about
And now I'm on my way
And all I have to say
Is there'll be no more cryin' and I truly belive that I

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I feel (I feel)
Better than I felt before (So much better, better)
'Cause theres no more drama knockin' at my door
I feel
Better than I felt before
'Cause theres no more drama in my life no more

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige and Diddy]
It's time to realize (People, it's time)
It's all up to you and I (All up to you and I)
Life is what you make it
If you don't give up the fight (Don't give up)
All this really means, that's all we need
Believe in all you feel (Ayo, Mary, I don't think they ready for this one)

[Verse 3: Diddy]
Now it's the D-I D again, D to the weezy
Been in the game twelve years, it ain't easy
Been in them things, got game that's so greasy
Spendin' them thangs with a chain that's so freezy
Please believe me, T.V. need me
Far as the CD, pump that on GP
What's the four-one-one, hun?
It's PD, MJB collabo with the BB
Period, no question, no comma
You hearin' this, no vest and no armor
Bring it to cats like Bush to Osama
Sippin' on 'Vu, make moves and no scar on her
Word to my mama, can't deal with the drama
That's why a nigga stay in the Bahamas
Layin' in pajamas
Two sexy mamas
Bodyguards, top guns, two extra llamas
I don't want no drama

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I feel
Better than I felt before
'Cause theres no more drama knockin' at my door (No more, no more, no more)
I feel (No more drama, y'all)
Better than I felt before (It's so hard, but I gotta say)
'Cause theres no more drama in my life no more

[Bridge]
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more
No more, no more
No more, no more
No more

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I feel
Better than I felt before
'Cause theres no more drama knockin' at my door
I feel
Better than I felt before
'Cause theres no more drama in my life no more
Down the way where the nights are gay
And the sun shines daily on the mountain top
I took a trip on a sailing ship
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop
But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston Town
Down at the market you can hear
Ladies cry out while on their heads they bear
Ackee Rice Salt fish are nice
And the rum are fine any time a year
But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston Town
Sounds of laughter everywhere
And the dancing girl swing to and fro
I must declare my heart is there
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico
But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I've had to leave a little girl in the Kingston Town
Down the way where the nights are gay
And the sun shines daily on the mountain top
I took a trip on a sailing ship
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop
But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston Town
Sad to say, I'm on my way
Won't be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston Town
It's been so long since I've been gone
Another day might be too long for me
Traveling around I've had my fill
Of broken dreams and dirty deals
A concrete jungle surrounding me
Many nights I've slept out in the streets
I paid my dues and I changed my style
Seen hard times. All over now

I want to come home. It's been so long since I've been away
And please, don't blame me 'cause I've tried
I'll be coming home soon to your love to stay

I miss old friends that I once had
Times they changed and I'll be glad when I go home
I don't know why this all came to me
But why I'm here I really can't see. And now...

I want to come home. It's been so long since I've been away
And please, don't blame me 'cause I've tried
I'll be coming home soon to your love to stay
Coming home to stay
Coming home to your love, mama
I've seen better days
I miss old friends that I once had
Times ain't changed and I'll be glad when I go home
I don't know why the thought came to me
But why I'm here I really can't see. And now...

I want to come home. It's been so long since I've been away
And please, don't blame me 'cause I've tried
I'll be coming home soon to your love to stay
Coming home to stay
Coming home to your love, mama
I've seen better days
Man are you for real?
You niggas can't be fucking serious
You not for real, you gotta be playing
You better walk away
I run shit here, y'all just sit here
Do y'all niggas know what it took for me to get here
I'm gonna stay here, earn my way here
You can fuck around if you want but we don't play here
We get through that, run right through that
That's how we do that, y'all niggas knew that
Two albums in one year three albums in two
Didn't I just fucking tell y'all niggas that's how we do
You wasn't even fucking listening when I just said
What I said, you get that, what I just said
I run shit here fuck y'all niggas
Jail what I said I used to duck y'all niggas
Motherfucker I'm grown and that's all to it
Y'all leave a child on his own and I'm gonna do it
Fuck I done did it, shit it
You ain't even half way close to being with it forget it
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, what's my name
Getting' down for real fuck my fame
Played too many games and the games gone catch up with you
Fame niggas make stretcha catch up with you quicka
You that nigga oh for real you that nigga
Let me show you how we do that nigga
See, y'all cats are small cats
And niggas like us aren't gonna believe that
We takin all that fall back
Get down, lay down, sit down
Stay down, head round Hey now
Does a nigga wanna get a little off his mind
I'm a nigga that will hit a nigga off his time
Go off his spine, brains in the air
Flames to the hair 'cause the game ain't fair
And I'll take it there fuckin' with the right one, baby
Got that, we tryin' to light one, baby
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit
I've done shit here my guns spit here
Y'all might live here but I run shit here
Blood sweats and tears for years just to sit here
Think I'm about to let you niggas get here
Cowards are stupid if you wanna see me prove it
Try and take my position watch a quick a nigga lose it
Make you get all my shit and have you fearing for your life
Every time you see me roll up or ride up on a bike
Dressed in all black with my pistol in your sight
But it will be my man in all white that walks up with a knife
I'm a big boy baby I don't play with you thin niggas
Getting my hands dirty when there's beef I send niggas
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit

If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be travelling on, now
'Cause there's too many places I've got to see
But, if I stayed here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you can not change
Lord knows, I can't change
Bye, bye, its been a sweet love
Though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take it badly
'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame
But, if I stayed here with you girl
Things just couldn't be the same
Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you'll never change
And this bird you can not change
Lord knows, I can't change
Lord help me, I can't change
I got to say it and it's hard for me
You got me crying like I thought I would never be
Love is believing but you let me down
How can I love you when you ain't around
And I
Get to the morning and you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it don't matter whatever you do
I made a life out of loving you
Only to find any dream that I follow is dying
I'm crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting
Feeling no pain
When will we meet again
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
Is it a lesson that I never knew?
Gotta get out of the spell that I'm under
My love for you
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was being what you want me to be?
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by
This world may end
Not you and I
My love is stronger than the universe
My soul is crying for you
And that cannot be reversed
You made the rules and you could not see
You made a life out of hurting me
Out of my mind
I am held by the power of you love
Tell me when do we try
Or should we say goodbye?
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was being what you want me to be?
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by
Oh
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
Is it a lesson that I never knew?
Suddenly everything I ever wanted
My love for you, ooh
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
I'm sitting on top of the world
Just rolling along, Just rolling along
I'm quitting the blues of the world
Just singing a song, just singing a song
"Glory Hallelujah," I just phoned the Parson
"Hey, Par get ready to call"
Just like Humpty Dumpty, I'm going to fall
I'm sitting on top of the world
Just rolling along, Just rolling along

I'm sitting on top of the world
Just rolling along, just rolling along
I'm quitting the blues of the world
Just singing a song, just singing a song
"Glory Hallelujah," I just phoned the Parson
"Hey, Par get ready to call"
Just like Humpty Dumpty, I'm going to fall
I'm sitting on top of the world

[Intro: Asabe Ighile]
Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four-door, no floor

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Hit me on the celly, watching Belly

Peanut butter Benz, got 'em jelly at the deli
If you feelin' like a ninja, I got a machete
Hell yeah, them girls bad, but I'm fuckin' heavy

I say some shit, he be like, "Yo, you so legendary"
But he can tell just by my face, he ain't gettin' any, kyuh

[Chorus: Asabe Ighile]
Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four-door, no floor

She was making that noise, oh, boy
Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four-door, no floor
He was serving that raw, oh, boy
She was making that noise, oh, boy

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Meet me at the Rucker, take the Bruckner

For they money and they whips, puttin' kitten on lips
Dividin' them dividends, get the money and dip
Keys to the nigga's safe, put it under my tits
He got ki's of that raw, it could fit in the six
Got a UPS connect, so we good on them trips
Automatic bottle service so we good in them VIPs, nigga

[Chorus: Asabe Ighile]
Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four-door, no floor
He was serving that raw, oh, boy
She was making that noise, oh, boy
Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four-door, no floor
He was serving that raw, oh, boy
She was making that noise, oh, boy

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
These civilians
What up, nigga? Excuse my millions
I-I-I'm in the V like a widow's peak
It's just me and my Rolls Royce pillow seats
Why they starin' at me? I brung McLaren with me
Yo, matter of fact, I think I'ma bring Donna Karan with me
And you my son, I'on't know, it's just the parent in me
I am the best, I am the queen, it's so apparent in me
I'm in Hollywood with Shia Labeouf
Most of you rappers ain't eatin', that diet is rough
You want some hot shit? Send that wire to us
I'll make 'em change they name to Diddy, retire the puff
I'm gettin' actin' money
You niggas is Kevin Hart, y'all be actin' funny
I'ma a keep a linebacker, tell 'em tackle for me
Yo, you seen my last pic, go double-tap that for me
Cock back
Red octagon, stop that
Well East coast girls are hip
I really dig those styles they wear
And the Southern girls with the way they talk
They knock me out when I'm down there
The Mid-West farmer's daughters really make you feel alright
And the Northern girls with the way they kiss
They keep their boyfriends warm at night
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California girls
The West coast has the sunshine
And the girls all get so tanned
I dig a french bikini on Hawaii island
Dolls by a palm tree in the sand
I been all around this great big world
And I seen all kinds of girls
Yeah, but I couldn't wait to get back in the states
Back to the cutest girls in the world
I wish they all could be California girls
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California girls
I wish they all could be Californian
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)
I wish they all could be Californian
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)
I wish they all could be Californian
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)
I wish they all could be Californian
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)
Feeling mighty blue
By myself
One ol' lonesome shoe
By myself
Now that love's behind me
You'll find me
By myself

I just sit and stare
At the floor
Just don't seem to care
Anymore
Since my baby's gone
Got a padlock on my door

That old black cat
Keeps hangin' 'round
But I ain't blaming him
'Cause things are bad
It ain't his fault
I've gone and lost
The only love
I ever had
Love
Love
I miss him so
It's no lie
And I'm so "double o"
I could die
So I'll be
Just me here
By myself
Is it getting better, or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you now, you got someone to blame?
You say, one love, one life, when it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you darlin', if you don't care for it
Mary

Did I disappoint you, or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love, and you want me to go without?
Well, it's too late tonight to drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other

One, one
One, one

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus to the lepers in your head?
Well did I ask too much, more than a lot?
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
See we hurt each other, then we do it again
You say love is a temple, love is a higher law
Love is a temple, love is a higher law
You ask for me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't keep holding on to what you've got, cause all you got is hurt
One love, one blood, one life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other, sisters and my brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One, one
One, one
One, one

One love, one love
I was thinking about you guy yesterday
I've been here three times before, and
I think I understand a little bit how you feel about some things
It's none of my business how you feel about some other things
And I don't give a damn about how you feel about some of the things
But anyways
I try to put myself in your place
And I believe this is the way that I would feel about San Quentin
San Quentin, you've been livin' hell to me
You've hosted me since nineteen sixty three
I've seen 'em come and go and I've seen 'em die
And long ago I stopped askin' why
San Quentin, I hate every inch of you
You've cut me and have scarred me through and thru
And I'll walk out a wiser weaker man;
Mister Congressman, you can't understand
(San Quentin)
San Quentin, what good do you think you do?
Do you think I'll be different when you're through?
You bent my heart and mind and you warp my soul;
And you stone walls turn my blood a little cold
San Quentin, may you rot and burn in hell
May your walls fall down and may I live to tell
May all the world forget you ever stood
And may all the world regret you did no good
San Quentin, I hate every inch of you
Thank you very much
(One more time) One more time?
Hey, before we do it, if uh
Any of the guards are still speaking to me, could I have a glass of water?
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I’d roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I’d kick it with who I wanted
And I’d never get confronted for it
Cause they’d stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I’d be a better man
I’d listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he’s taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it’s broken
So they’d think that I was sleepin’ alone
I’d put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that she’d be faithful
Waitin’ for me to come home
To come home
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I’d be a better man
I’d listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he’s taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you’re just a boy
You don’t understand
Yeah, you don’t understand
How it feels to love a girl, someday
You wish you were a better man
You don’t listen to her
You don’t care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you’ve taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you’re just a boy
I want you to know that I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me
Is she perverted like me
Would she go down on you in a theatre
Does she speak eloquently
And would she have your baby
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, 'til you died
But you're still alive

[Chorus]
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
Are you thinking of me when you fuck her
Cause the love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, 'til you died
But you're still alive

[Chorus]
And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

But you’re just a boy
Yeah, you don’t understand
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you’ve taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you’re just a boy
(What can I say?)
(What can I do?)

3 AM, it's me again, wouldn't you know?
Things would have to end this way
I did my best the perfect guest knew when to go
Perfect you knew when to stay

Come on, tell me that you love me, dear
I've been feeling down some too
After all, it's time I made it clear
I've been waiting just for you

(What can I say?) Oh, you make me know, baby
(What can I do?) To show you that I care
(What can I say?) Got to have your number, baby
(What can I do?)

Dodododo....

Can't you see the people who stop and stare
Don't it make you wonder why?
I just happened to be standing there
Can't you see it in my eye?
(What can I say?) You got me acting like a fool, girl
(What can I do?) Stop making like a little school, girl
(What can I say?) Could be your lucky day, baby
(What can I do?)

Ooooh, it's hot
Ooohooo, it's hot, little girl

Ooooooo talking girl

(What can I say?) Oh, you make me know, baby
(What can I do?) To show you that I care
(What can I say?) Oh, I got down on my knees
(What can I do?)

Please, please, what can I say?
(What can I do?)
(What can I do?) Oooh, what can I do
(What can I say?) What can I say, baby?
(What can I say?)
One day, you will be cared to realize
By the look that's in my eyes

[Chorus]
How much I love you
(Love you)
And if you leave you'll lose a precious love
(You'll lose a precious love)

Somehow,these arms of mine can't let you go
The touch of my hand baby should let you know

[Chorus]
We go together like hand and glove
Don't destroy our precious love
Somehow these arms of mine can't let you go
The touch of my hand should let you know
Now you're moving on up, pretty baby
You're leaving me behind
Everybody seems to love you
Oh, you're doing just fine, fine, fine
But take away your good looks
And all your fancy clothes
Why don't you just
Try it baby
Try it baby
Try it baby
Try it baby
You'll see that nobody loves you but me
Nobody loves you but me
Now you tell me that you so busy, pretty baby
You ain't got much time
Oh, how will I remember all your time was mine, mine, mine
Well move on back cross the track, baby
Where you came from
Why don't you just
Try it baby
Try it baby
Try it baby
Try it baby
You'll see that nobody loves you but me
Nobody loves you but me
I really wanna hold you, pretty baby
In my arms again
But I can't get close to you
For all your loving friend, friend, friend
But take your name from the bright lights baby
And tell me that you are all through
Come on and
Try it honey
Try it baby
Try it sweetheart
Try it honey
You'll see that nobody loves you but me
I want to tell you
If you think I'm lying
She keeps her secrets
In her eyes
She wraps the truth
Inside her lies
Just when I can't say
What she's done to me
She comes to me
And leads me back to paradise
She's so hard to hold
But I can't let go

[Chorus]
I'm a house of cards
In a hurricane
A reckless ride
In the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain
Is all I wanna feel
She tears away just like a child
She drives me crazy
Drives me wild
But I'm helpless when she smiles
Oh when she smiles
Maybe I'd fight if I could
It hurts so bad
But feels so good
She opens up just like
A rose to me
When she's close to me
Anything she'd ask me to
I would
It's out of control
But I can't let go

[Chorus]
When she looks at me
I get so weak

[Chorus]
May God's bless and keep you always
May your wishes all come true
May you always do for others
And let others do for you
May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung
May you stay
Forever young
Forever young
Forever young
May you stay
Forever young
May you grow up to be righteous
May you grow up to be true
May you always know the truth
And see the lights surrounding you
May you always be courageous
Stand upright and be strong
And may you stay
Forever young
Forever young
Forever young
May you stay
Forever young
May your hands always be busy
May your feet always be swift
May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift
May your heart always be joyful
May your song always be sung
And may you stay
Forever young
Forever young
Forever young
May you stay
Forever young
Still is the life
Of your room when you're not inside
And all of your things
Tell the sweetest storyline
Your tears on these sheets
And your footsteps are down the hall
So tell me what I did
I can't find where the moment went wrong at all
You can be mad in the morning
I'll take back what I said
Just don't leave me alone here
It's cold, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
C'mon back to bed
What will this fix?
You know you're not a quick forgive
And I won't sleep through this
I survive on the breath you are finished with
You can be mad in the morning
I'll take back what I said
Just don't leave me alone here
It's cold, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
You can be mad in the morning
Or the afternoon instead
But don't leave me
98 and 6 degrees of separation from you, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Why don't you come back to bed?
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell'
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
'Please bring me my wine'
He said, 'we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine'
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say"

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device'
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
'Relax' said the night man
'We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave
Well, shake it up, baby, now
(Shake it up, baby)
Twist and shout
(Twist and shout)
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby, now
(Come on baby)
Come on and work it on out
(Work it on out)
Well, work it on out, honey
(Work it on out)
You know you look so good
(Look so good)
You know you got me goin', now
(Got me goin')
Just like I knew you would
(Like I knew you would)
Well, shake it up, baby, now
(Shake it up, baby)
Twist and shout
(Twist and shout)
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby, now
(Come on baby)
Come on and work it on out
(Work it on out)
You know you twist your little girl
(Twist your little girl)
You know you twist so fine
(Twist so fine)
Come on and twist a little closer, now
(Twist a little closer)
And let me know that you're mine
(Let me know you're mine)
Well, shake it up, baby, now
(Shake it up, baby)
Twist and shout
(Twist and shout)
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby, now
(Come on baby)
Come on and work it on out
(Work it on out)
You know you twist your little girl
(Twist your little girl)
You know you twist so fine
(Twist so fine)
Come on and twist a little closer, now
(Twist a little closer)
And let me know that you're mine
(Let me know you're mine)
Well, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby, now
(Shake it up baby)
Well, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby, now
(Shake it up baby)
Well, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby, now
(Shake it up baby)
Thank you, Lord, for what you've done for me
Thank you, Lord, for what you're doing now
Thank you, Lord, for ev'ry little thing
Thank you, Lord, for you made me sing

Say I'm in no competition
But I made my decision
You can keep your opinion
I'm just calling on the wise man's communion

Thank you, Lord, for what you've done for me
Thank you, Lord, for what you're doing now
Thank you, Lord, for ev'ry little thing
Thank you, Lord, for you made me sing

Sing along, sing along

I don't fear their humiliation
Just to prove my determination
I don't yield to temptation
I haven't learn't my lesson in Revelation
Thank you, Lord, for what you've done for me
Thank you, Lord, for what you're doing now
Thank you, Lord, for ev'ry little thing
Thank you, Lord, for you made me sing

Sing along, sing along

Say I'm in no competition
But I made my decision
Lord, in my simple way
Comin', comin', comin', comin'
I love to pray

Thank you, Lord, for what you've done for me
Thank you, Lord, for what you're doing now
Thank you, Lord, for ev'ry little thing
Would you like to go with me down my dead end street?
Would you like to come with me to Village Ghetto Land?
See the people lock their doors while robbers laugh and steal
Beggars watch and eat their meals from garbage cans

Broken glass is everywhere, it's a bloody scene
Killing plagues the citizens unless they own police
Children play with rusted cars, sores cover their hands
Politicians laugh and drink, drunk to all demands

Families buying dog food now, starvation roams the streets
Babies die before they're born, infected by the grief
Now some folks say that we should be glad for what we have
Tell me, would you be happy in Village Ghetto Land?
Village Ghetto Land
Yes, my skin is black
But that's no reason to hold me back
Why don't you think about it, think about it
Think about it, think about it, think about it
Think about it, think about it
I have wants and desires just like you
So move on aside because I'm comin' through, oh
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Yes, your skin is white
Does that make you right?
Why don't you think about it, think about it
Think about it, think about it, think about it
Think about it, think about it
This is a message, a message to y'all
Together we stand, divided we fall
Black is a color just like white
Tell me how can a color determine whether you're wrong or right
We all have our faults, yes, we do
So look in your mirror, what do you see?
Two eyes, a nose and a mouth just like me
Oh, your eyes are open but you refuse to see
The laws of society were made for both you and me
Because of my color, I struggle to be free
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But in the end, you're gonna' see my friend, oh
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
We are rollin', rollin', rollin', we are rollin' on
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Hey, we are rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' on
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
You can't stop me, you can't stop me
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud
I'm black and I'm proud
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud
I'm black and I'm proud
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop me now
Say it loud
I'm black and I'm proud
Catch a wave and you're sittin' on top of the world
Don't be afraid to try the greatest sport around
Catch a wave, catch a wave
Everybody tries it once
Those who don't just have to put it down
You paddle out, turn around and raise
And baby that's all there is to the coastline craze
You gotta catch a wave and you're sittin' on top of the world
Not just a fad 'cause it's been going on so long
Catch a wave, catch a wave
All the surfers going strong
They said it wouldn't last too long
They'll eat their words with a fork and spoon and watch 'em
They'll hit the road and all be surfin' soon
And when they catch a wave they'll be sittin' on top of the world
Catch a wave and you're sittin' on top of the world
So take a lesson from a top-notch surfer boy
Catch a wave, catch a wave
Every Saturday boy
But don't you treat it like a toy
Just get away from the shady turf
And baby go catch some rays on the sunny surf
And when you catch a wave you'll be sittin' on top of the world
We are put up on top of the world
Catch a wave, you'll be sittin' on top of the world
We are put up on top of the world

[Verse 1]
Look over yonder, here come the blues
The thirteenth of any time, dressed by fools
I can see 'em comin'
Wearing a blue polcadot coat
Playing his violins
Hittin' wrong notes
Look over yonder, he's comin' my way
When he's around, I never have a happy day

[Interlude]
See that? I just broke my guitar strings

[Verse 2]
Look over yonder
Well, he's talkin' to my baby
They found my peace pipe on her
Now they're draggin' her away
Lord knows we don't need a devil like him beatin' us around
Well, he's knockin' on my door
How my house is burnin' down
Now don't you come no closer
The path is keepin' me bolder
Wait by my door baby
Unless you want to start another war
Look over yonder, hey
Look over yonder
Look over yonder
Look over yonder

[WYCLEF]
A dedication to all the refugees worldwide
One time say, say, say
I remember when we used to sit in the government yard in Brooklyn
Observing the crookedness as it mingled with the good people we meet
Good friends we had
Good friends we've lost along the way
In this great future you can't forget your past, So dry your tears
I say And to my peeps who passed away
No woman, no cry, no woman no cry, say say say
Hey little sister don't shed no tears
No woman no cry say say say
I remember when we used to rock in a project yard in Jersey
And little Georgie would make the firelight
As stolen cars passed through the night
And then we'd hit the corner store for Roots, paper, and brew
My drink's my only remedy
For pain of losing family, but while I'm gone Shorty
Everything's gonna be alright, everything's gonna be alright
Fugees come to the dance tonight, everything's gonna be alright
O everything's gonna be alright
The gun man's in the house tonight
But everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
Oh ah oh ah
Oh ah oh ah
Oh ah oh ah
Oh ah oh ah
Oh ah oh ah
Oh ah oh ah
Oh ah oh ah

[CLEF]
No woman no cry, no woman no cry
Hey, little sister, don't shed no tears
No woman no cry say say say
I remember when we used to sit in a government yard in Trenchtown
The hypocrites as they mingled with the good people we meet
Good friends we had Oh good friends we've lost
Along the way hey
In this great future
You can't forget your past so dry your tears I say
And no woman no cry. No woman no cry say say say
Hey, little sistser, don't shed no tears
No woman no cry and to my peeps who passed away

[Chorus]
Oh ah oh ah
Oh ah oh ah
Oh ah oh ah
Oh ah oh ah
Oh ah oh ah
For once in my life
I have someone who needs me
Someone I needed so long
For once unafraid
I can go where life leads me
And somehow I know I'll be strong

For once I can touch
What my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Ooh, ooh, ooh, someone like you
Would ever dream of makin' my dreams come true

For once in my life
I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before, oh
For once I have something I know won't desert me
'Cause I'm not alone anymore

For once I can say
This is mine, you can't take it
Long as I know I've got love I can make it
For once in my life
I've got that someone who needs me
Mmm hmm hmm
For once I can say
This is sho' nuff mine, you can't take it
Long as I know I've got love I can make it
For once in my life
I've got that someone who needs me

Oh, yes, he does
I've got that someone who needs me
He told me this mornin' that he needed me
Mmm mmm I believe
I am that, thou art that and all this is that
I am that, thou art that, all this is that
I am that, thou art that, all this is that
This is that, ooh
Daybreak and I take a glide
Into the pool of peace inside
To waves and I, both travel by
Life supporting waves of bliss
Mother Divine's precious kiss
Brings with love the light of wisdom
And the gift of eternal freedom
To waves and I, both travel by
And that makes all the difference to me
All this is that
I am that, thou art that, all this is that
I am that, thou art that, all this is that
This is that, ooh
Dusk time, the shadows fall
Into the timeless time of all
To waves and I, both travel by
Golden auras glow around you
Omnipresent love surrounds you
Wisdom warming as the sun
You and I are truly one
To waves and I, both travel by
And that makes all the difference to me
I am that, thou art that, all this is that
I am that, thou art that, all this is that
I am that, thou art that, all this is that
I am that, thou art that, all this is that
I am that, thou art that, all this is that
I am that, thou art that, all this is that
I am that, thou art that, all this is that
Jai Gurudev, Jai Gurudev
Jai Gurudev, Jai Gurudev
It's hot, I'm steamy, sweatin', tossin' and turnin'
The whole house on fire and I can't stop it from burnin'
The curtains and the walls all indulged in flames
I yell, "Somebody help me" but ain't nobody came
I try my best to put it out then I said, "Fuck it!"
Break full speed to the back door one room away
But the faster and harder I ran it seemed like the longer I took
Prayin', "Please God spare me, I don't wanna cook!"
Knew that I did done some things that I shouldn't of
I knew I didn't come into Sunday service like I could have
But have mercy for your child, forgive me for my sins
I'm too young to die, Lord, get me through this
We gotta get to the back, don't gotta get to the kitchen
But they got thick black smoke comin' from the kitchen
Shit, all other exits are tossed, what I'ma do?
Stay my ass here and burn or run the fuck through?
Already havin' trouble breathin' when I started to cough
But no more time to waste, I cover my face and took off
Disendehydrate, I'm gettin' tireder
I gotta, keep movin', 'cause it's gettin' hotter
And hotter, whoo, whoa, shit!, I'm on fire
C-c-call them people to me, I-I-I'm on fire
C-c-call them people to me, I-I-I'm on fire
C-c-call them people to me, I-I-I'm on fire
I-I-I'm on fire, I-I-I'm on fire
C-c-call them people to me, I-I-I'm on fire
C-c-call them people to me, I-I-I'm on fire
I gotta get out of here, I've been trapped for over fifty five minutes
Looks like I'm finished, this could be a fucked up endin'
I done been in some fucked up shit but this the worst I ever been in
"Call them people to me", tell 'em send the fire engine
I hope this ain't my calling y'all 'cause I ain't ready
I'ma need some alerted emergency units to stand by, paramedics
Runnin' through the fire, I can't turn back
Somethin' went and everythin' went black
I can't see, I can't see, I'm blind
Oh fuck, I'm alright, I just had my eyes closed the whole time
Oops, shit damn!, But that ain't my stop my shoes from movin'
'Cause outside, here I am
I smashed through the back door like a ram
I made it! I'm still alive! I'm still a man!
Out the house but still I got fire on my clothes
So I stopped, dropped and rolled dig rolled
Started goin' wild on the ground tryin' to get the flames out my shirt
Windmillin' in the dirt but nothin' didn't work
I heard a, but that was just a barge
See, I live right by the river, that's it! Water!
Every step I took made hot footprints in the tar
Runnin' over cars to the twelfth ward wall
Get out the way 'cause everything I touch turn crispy
I'ma be at the riverfront, tell 'em people come get me
C-c-call them people to me, I-I-I'm on fire
C-c-call them people to me, I-I-I'm on fire
C-c-call them people to me, I-I-I'm on fire
I-I-I'm on fire, I-I-I'm on fire
Sparks like aluminum foil in the microwave oven
Where them fuckin' people? Somebody do somethin'
Can't you see what's happenin'?
Don't you see the smoke? Can't you hear the cracklin'?
Nobody wanna listen, everybody was scatterin'
I grab a nigga, he screamed so loud that shit was eardrum shatterin'
I said, "Don't scream dawg, I need your help, I'm the one on fire!"
He said, "Nigga, you supposed to be dead, how you still alive?"
He was right, by now they should be embalmin' me
But the shit don't seem to be harmin' me
Damn, this must have been a bad dream the whole while then
I heard them motherfuckin' sirens, hollerin'
I guess they finally got the people to me, they must have saw me
Huh, 'cause they was headed right for me

If trouble was money, I'd swear I'd be a millionaire
If trouble was money, babe, I'd swear I'd be a millionaire
If worries was dollar bills
I'd buy the whole world and have money to spare

Worry, worry, baby, I've had worries on my mind
I said, "Worry, worry, worry, baby
I've had worries all my life"
You know times is hard, baby, yeah, I swear, I don't tell you no lie

My mother used to tell me
She said, "Son, there gonna be days like this"
I said, "My mother used to tell me"
She said, "Son, there gonna be days like this"

She said, "I want you to always be a winner
I love you, son, I don't want you to quit"
There were times I knew
But I found it hard to say
You were special in my life
Never thought you'd go away

I'll be strong
I'll get by
Without you in my life
I can see
Through your lies
Did you ever love me
I never found your love

[Chorus]
You and I know
Love is leaving
And you don't want me anymore
Why should I
Even try
You and I know
Love is leaving
Now you're the last thing on my mind
Someone else
I will find
A memory I've left behind
If I ever made you cry
Any reason I can't find
It was lonely by your side
Like a fool, I stood by you
I'll be strong
I'll get by
Without you in my life
I can see
Through your lies
Did you ever love me
I never found your love

[Chorus]
Is there something I could do
Is there something I should say
Is there someone else to keep you from
And now (Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
You and I know
Love is leaving
And you don't want me anymore
Why should I
Even try

You and I know
Love is leaving
Now you're the last thing on my mind
Why should I
Even try
You were my wife
My life, my hopes and dreams
For you to understand what this means
I shall explain
I stood all the jealousy
All the bitchin', too
Yes I'd forget it all
Once in bed with you
Oh darlin'
How did we end up like this?
Oh baby let me reminisce
(Ooh baby) And when we
Ooh, we stop the hands of time
You set my soul on fire
My one desire was to love you
And think of you with pride
And keep you satisfied
Oh baby, oh baby
We could not bear the mental strain
Leave you, I never meant to
Now you see how much you hurt me
But, if you ever need me
I'll be by yor side
Though the many happy times we had
Can really never outweigh the bad
Oh, I never loved nobody
Like I love you, baby
Now it's time for us to say farewell
Farewell my darlin'
Maybe we'll meet down the line
(Ooh baby) It's too late for you and me
It's too late for you and I
Much too late for you to cry
It's too late for you and me
Much too late for you and I
It's too late for you and me
Much too late for you to cry, baby
Oh, we tried
God knows we tried
Now it's too late
To live and learn
Oh, it's too late, baby
It's too late for you and me
Much too late for you to cry
Oh
It's much too late
Talking:

Oh, well
All we can do is we can both try to be happy
I've been in this town so long that back in the city
I've been taken for lost and gone
And unknown for a long, long time

Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl
From the Spanish and Indian home
Of the heroes and villains

Once at night Catillian squared the fight
And she was right in the rain of the bullets
That eventually brought her down

But she's still dancing in the night
Unafraid of what a dude'll do
In a town full of heroes and villains

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
Stand or fall I know there shall be peace in the valley
And it's all an affair
Of my life with the heroes and villains

In the Catina
Margareta keeps the spirit high
There I watched her
She spun around and whilst (ha-ha-ha)
She kept the warmth in her body and the flame of the dance

Dance Margareta
Don't you know that I'm in love with you

You're under arrest!

My children were raised
You know they suddenly rise
They started slow long ago
Head to toe, healthy, wealthy, and wise

I've been in this town so long
So long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff
To ride in the rough
And sunny down snuff I'm all right
By the heroes and
Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
Do you wanna go straight to Hawaii, Hawaii?
(Hawaii, Hawaii)
Straight to Hawaii
(Hawaii, Hawaii)
Or do you wanna come along with me?
(Honolulu, Waikiki)
(Do you wanna come along with me?)
I heard about all the pretty girls
With their grass skirts down to their knees
All my life I wanted to see
The island called Hawaii
Go to Hawaii, Hawaii
(Hawaii, Hawaii)
Straight to Hawaii
(Hawaii, Hawaii)
Or do you wanna come along with me?
(Honolulu, Waikiki)
(Do you wanna come along with me?)
Now, I don't know what town you're from
But don't tell me that they got bigger waves
'Cause everyone that goes
Comes back with nothing but raves
That's in Hawaii, Hawaii
(Hawaii, Hawaii)
That's in Hawaii
(Hawaii, Hawaii)
Or do you wanna come along with me?
(Honolulu, Waikiki)
(Do you wanna come along with me?)
Now, pretty soon this Winter
They'll hold the Surfing Championship of the year
Surfer guys and girls
Will be coming from far and near
Go to Hawaii, Hawaii
(Hawaii, Hawaii)
Straight to Hawaii
(Hawaii, Hawaii)
Or do you wanna come along with me?
(Honolulu, Waikiki)
(Do you wanna come along with me?)
Honolulu, Waikiki
Do you wanna come along with me?
Honolulu, Waikiki
Oh, it's over, it's all over
Said, it's over, it's all over, baby
I gotta get away from you as fast as I can
You're too much for me, woman, more than my heart can stand
Like a kid behind the wheel
You've been reckless with my heart
If I stayed around, you'd surely tear it all apart
Say, the road has got to end somewhere
Honey, honey, every road has got to end somewhere
Now is the time for the showdown
So let me give you the lowdown
Now, we've come to the end of our road
Woman, I'm just thinkin' 'bout all the times you promised to call
And I sat at home lonely
You only did it 'cause you knew I love you only
Runnin', runnin' around with every guy in town
I'm tellin' you, woman, no longer will I be your clown
Say, the road has got to end somewhere
Every road has got to end somewhere
Woman, I'm tired of your stuff, say enough is enough
We've come to the end of our road
I can't take it no more
Woman, there's no sense in you beggin' and pleadin'
To hold on when I'm the one you're leavin'
Say 

[Incomprehensible] had my fill of you
Flirtin's all through the years and I've almost run out of tears
I'm tellin' you, I couldn't cry if I wanted to
The road has got to end somewhere
Woman, woman, every road has got to end somewhere
Time and again I've begged you to slow down
So I'm givin' you the lowdown
We've come to the end of our road, road, road
Oh, this is the end, the end of our road
Oh, this is the end, the end of our road
Oh, this is the end, the end of our road
...
My babe, my babe
My babe, my babe
My baby, my baby
She is so sweet to me
As sweet as honey
She make me feel like 

[Incomprehensible]
She walk like an angel
She got a ways like a child
A million dollar kiss
And a billion dollar smile
My babe, my babe
My baby, my baby
She's so sweet to me, yeah
I don't need money, I don't need gold
I need her love to satisfy my soul
With my babe I don't need a thing
But a married life and a wedding ring
My babe, my babe
My baby, my baby
You're so sweet to me
Show me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free, I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say, forever gaze, if only
Beauty roams to an endless love
There's no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
There's nowhere to run, I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body and soul
How can it be you're asking me
To feel the things you never show?
Tell me why can't I be there where you are
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart
I have a mansion, forget the price
Ain't never been there, they tell me it's nice
I live in hotels, tear out the walls
I have accountants pay for it all

They say I'm crazy but I have a good time
I'm just looking for clues at the scene of the crime
Life's been good to me so far

My Maserati does one-eighty-five
I lost my license, now I don't drive
I have a limo, ride in the trunk
I lock the doors in case I get drunk

I make hit records, my fans they can't wait
They write Tim letters, tell Glenn Don's great
So I got me an office, gold records on the wall
Just leave a message, maybe I'll call

Lucky I'm sane after all I've been through
(Everybody say I'm cool) (He's cool)
I can't complain but sometimes I still do
Life's been good to me so far
I go to parties, sometimes until four
It's hard to leave when you can't find some more
It's tough to handle this fortune and fame
Everybody's so different, we're all insane
They say I'm lazy but it takes all my time
(Everybody say oh, yeah) (Oh, yeah)
I keep on going, guess I'll never know why
Life's been good to me so far
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Why , why why why why
Cause I keep bangin' y'all mother-fuckin ass, with this shit
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide
I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
I'm too hip to drip, I do it to 'em like this
I wan't-a load it up, cock back don't miss
Y'all ain't goin' believe this
Got the preacher's wife talkin' bout rock that shit
All they do is say the mans name
You watch how many bitches start comin', it's a damn shame
They know I got the wood for 'em
If they in the hotel room and get the dick, that's good for 'em
Big pussy and it's soft dick time, bitch I got to get'cha, mm-hm, uh-huh
Tell me what you goin' do
If you got your friends with you, you could bring them ho's too
Come and turn around, let me get behind you
Move somethin' for me baby, I ain't goin' tell no body
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide
I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide
I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
I'm too hip to drip
When I'm here they got to have it
White lines so live they jump off the cabinet
It's Micheal Tyler not Black Sabbath
It's springin' hunter so watch out for the cat parrot
I'm a whole and kaniver, the hot enchilada, Big Truck driver
Hittin' hookers is a side high
Tuckin' guts stackin' paper formin' lyrics is my real job
Got my fingers and my shit tight
Got another album and contract bitch get right
Form a crowd like a fist fight
Take my time with it if it takes me sun-up to midnight
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide
I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide
I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
I'm too hip to drip
I'm too man to try to handle, I'm too bad and loaded too for you to hold
Too tight to out-write, too strong to out-sold, too much to out-bust
I'll talk shit and cuss, foul-dog rimp and the walk talk spit crush
The paper towels and toilet tissue, start your engine set the table
Clean your plate and wash the dishes
Can I please get a source cup
And if they don't give me my grammy, feel so sorry for your mother
And after I'm goin' get Jive
I done bust my ass, y'all ain't do y'all job
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide
I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide
I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
I'm too hip to drip
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide
I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide
I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
I'm too hip to drip
I can't help but wait
I can't help but wait, check it out
I see you, you wit him, he ain't right but you don't trip
You stand by, while he lies, then turn right round and forgive
I can't take, to see your face wit those tears running down yo cheeks
But what can I do, I gotta stay true, because deep down I'm still a G
And I don't wanna come between you and your man
Even tho I know I'll treat you better than he can
Girl I can't help but wait

[Chorus]
Till you get back wit him, it don't change (Can't help but wait)
Till you see that wit me, it ain't the same (Can't help but wait)
Till you, see you, for what you really are (Baby girl you are a star)
And I can't help but wait
It ain't fresh, to just let him call the shots
Your a queen, you should be, getting all that someones got
You should be rocking the latest, and purses, bracelets and watches
You're worth much more than an occasional "I love you", "I'm thinking of you"
And I don't wanna come between you and your man, no
Even tho I know I'll treat you better than he can
Girl I can't help but wait

[Chorus]
Get it together, you can do better
Seeing is believing, and I see what you need so
I'm gonna play my position, let you catch what you been missing
I'm calling out! Girl because I can't help but wait

[Chorus: x2]
Can't help but wait, can't help but wait, can't help but wait, no, no, no
Oh, so long before this night I prayed
That a star would guide you my way
To share with me this special day
Well, ribbon's in the sky for our love
If allowed, may I touch your hand
And if pleased may I once again?
So that you too will understand
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love
Do do
Do do do do do
Hmm hmm
This is not a coincidence
And far more than a lucky chance
But what it is that was always meant
Is our ribbon in the sky for our love, love
We can't lose with God on our side
We'll find strength in each tear we cry
From now on it will be you and I
And our ribbon in the sky
Ribbon in the sky
A ribbon in the sky for our love
Do do
Do do do do do
Hmm hmm
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love
Monsuno... monsuno!

I feel the power
Man of the hour
Got my core ready and
The skills to devour
I came to battle
Who wanna battle
Spin (monsuno)
Now flip it in the battle

Yo!
Make, make, make it
Launch, launch (monsuno)
Make, make, make it
Launch, launch, launch
I came to wreck it

Yo! i'm punching out (t-t-turn it up)
I got the whole world spinning out
Monsuno!
Yo! i punch it out (t-t-turn it up)
I got the whole world spinning out
Monsuno!
Listen all you girlies
Even though I haven't met you
Gonna catch you soon
In my butterfly net
You'd better watch out

Sometimes when I watch you
I stretch out my hand to touch you
Cause it drives my me wild
To see you flutter by
You butterfly

I won't squeeze you dead
Aiming through your head
I just want your love

I won’t write your name
In Latin in a frame
Cause framing is a chain

Listen all you girlies
Even though I haven't met you
Gonna catch you soon
In my butterfly net
You'd better watch out
All alone at the end of the evening
And the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have loved me
I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer
Spent my life runnin' 'round

Somebody's going to hurt someone before the night is through
And it's so hard to change
Can't seem to settle down
But the dreams I've seen lately keep on turning out
And burning out and turning out the same
So put me on a highway and show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time
You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?
And when you're looking for your freedom
Nobody seems to care
And you can't find the door
Can't find it anywhere
When there's nothing to believe in still you're coming back
You're running back, you're coming back for more
So put me on a highway and show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

[Repeat: x7]
Take it to the limit, take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more time
There's a world where
I can go and
Tell my secrets to
In my room
In my room

In this world I
Lock out all my
Worries and my fears
In my room
In my room

Do my dreaming and my scheming
Lie awake and pray?
Do my crying and my sighing
Laugh at yesterday?

Now it's dark and
I'm alone but
I won't be afraid
In my room
In my room
In my room, in my room
In my room, in my room
Lookin' at you from a distance
Gettin' all of my attention
Could this be love at first sight, baby
You walked away and I missed you
Visions of wanting to kiss you
How could this be if I don't really know you?
Ohh baby, baby
Could it be love at first sight?
And I never knew that I, could fall in love on the very first night
Could this be love?
You had on the latest fashion
It was a bigger distraction
It drew me closer and closer to you, yeah, baby
I never saw anything like this
But you I just could not resist
I swallowed my pride and stepped through your side
Or could it be - be
Could it be love at first sight?
And I never knew that I, could fall in love on the very first night
Could this be love?
I wanna know if you could call me up (could you call me up sometime? please)
And maybe somebody we just might hook up, could this love at first sight?
Once again, it's that other M&M now
How many women feelin' him?
Somebody call the coroner, quick, Mary is killin 'em
Tell 'em what's the 411 and who came runnin'
When Clef dialed 911 from shots comin'
This somethin' for the radio, guest starring M.C
Johnny Blazin' the hip hop and R&B
What, ya'll thought ya wasn't gon' see me
You can't spell Mary J. Blige without a J.B
Well back to the matter, and it's sex on the platter
She only wanna be happy and I ain't mad at her
You go momma, nowadays, I'm more calmer
And if you take a look at my life, no more drama
Now you know, you searchin' for a Wu-Tang pro
You find me, just bout everywhere the poontang go
Now you know, feel me like your favorite love song
Could it be love at first sight?
And I never knew that I, could fall in love on the very first night
Could this be love?
Could it be love at first sight?
And I never knew that I, could fall in love on the very first night
Could this be love?
Woke up this morning, felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them old walking blues
I woke up this morning, felt around, felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them old, mean old walking blues

Leaving in the morning if I have to, robbed blind
Ive been mistreated and I don't mind dying
I'm leaving in the morning if I have to, robbed blind
Ive been mistreated and I just don't mind dying

She got a Belgium movement from her head down to her toes
Breaking on a dollar most anywhere she goes

Well I got a good woman coming my way
Tried to try, some electric panting, some electric chilling crying
But, ooh, mistook, misgiven
Got me up and walking baby, but I'm walking blue, walking blue

Well some people say boy, the walking blues ain't bad
It's the worst old feeling I most ever had
La la la la la la lala la
La la la la la la lala la
La la la la la la lala la
La la la la la la lala la
For you
There might be another star
But through my eyes the light of you it's all I see
For you
There might be another song
But all my heart can hear is your melody
So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one
Who would break my heart in two
For you
Love might bring a toast of wine
But which each sparkle know the best for you I pray
For you
Love might be for you to find
But I will celebrate our love of yesterday
So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one
Who would break my heart in two
For you
There might be another star
But through my eyes the light of you it's all I see
For you
There might be another song
But in my heart your melody will stay with me

I make a million dollar dream become reality without a doubt
I get paid for every rhyme coming out my mouth
And gangsta rap pays the bills so I represent it
And who we be
Some soldiers down that no limit
I have em' tweakn'
Possessed like an evil spirit
We on the rise
But labeled as them bad guys
We're family tied
And run like the enterprize
Fool is you legal
But bugs is segal
This ain't no sequil
You damn sure not my equal
And playa haters don't last too long
Axe a million motherfuckers with my disc
Sittin' at they home
My edvasaries is slowly being put to death

And trying to breathe
They last breath
I mean you reaching for the stars
But you can't grip

Ball til you fall, young nigga fuck the haters

Ow, people gather round me, it's whom it may concern
I'm not trying to run your life

But you're never too old to learn, huh

Stop worrying about your neighbors and the fancy things they got
'Cause if you do you'll find it sure, you're gonna wind up on the spot

Don't let the Jones
Don't let the Jone: Get you down, oh down

One more time

Don't let the Joneses
Don't let the Jones
Don't let the Joneses
Get you down, oh down

Woo, woo oh oh oh

Huh, you may not believe it but nine times out of ten it's true
The people you're trying to keep up with
Are trying to keep up too

Remember that old saying, "All that glitters ain't gold"
Take heed, don't ignore it until your money time will hold. Oh

Don't let the Jones
Don't let the Jones

You're lying to yourself but you don't even know it
You're so busy following the Joneses, you ain't got time to show it
Keeping up with the Joneses, it'll only makes your life a mess
Bill collectors, tranquilizers and getting deeper in debt

You better leave
The Joneses alone
Tell 'em one more time
You better leave, oh leave
The Joneses alone
Otis: Joneses got a new car today
Here's what you should say
Harray for the Joneses!
Instead you worry till your whole head turns gray
Worry 'bout the Joneses

Melvin Remember it's their car and they're the ones who had to pay
So leave Jo-Jo-Joneses alone
Listen, your car might be old, but remember it never fails to get you where you want to go

If there's someone else in this world you love more than me
I won't be selfish, girl, I'll just set you free
And when you're leaving, I won't cry, and I won't sigh
I'll say the words 'goodbye' and throw you a kiss
Yeah baby, a farewell kiss, hoo hoo

Remember, it doesn't take much to make a man cry when he's in love, oh yeah
So don't, don't let it you bother you when the tears start to fill my eyes, oh yeah
No, don't let my cryin' change your mind
Just tell me the words 'goodbye' and throw me a kiss
Yeah baby, a farewell kiss, hoo hoo

I know the grass looks greener, so much greener on the other side
But listen, you won't miss your water until your well runs dry

And when his love, his love for you grows old, yeah
And suddenly you find yourself left in the cold, yeah
You've got to be strong when things go wrong
Just tell him the words 'goodbye' and throw him a kiss
Yeah baby, a farewell kiss, hoo
Somethin' that you won't miss
Yeah baby, a farewell kiss, hoo hoo
And throw him a kiss
Yeah baby, a farewell kiss
Hey girl, I've been thinkin'
About you in see-through secrets
Crawlin' on my thousand thread count
Down, down, down
Play, play hard to get at
Cause you know I'll love to chase that
Til you push me on the bed, now start your show

(Chorus)
Baby cause I'm all tied up inside, come save me
I get lonely (I get lonely), I get blue (I get blue)
I want you baby (I want you baby), I need you (all I need is you)
Baby cause I'm all tied up inside, come save me
I get lonely (come and save me), I get blue (come and save me)
I want you baby, I need you (all I need is you)
Lay, lay across my pillow
As you make love to my ego
And you always treat me like a superstar
Oh, I'm so obsessed
You know I'm such a mess, but
When I see you get undressed and you start your show
(Chorus)
I'm all tied up (girl I get so locked up inside)
I get so blue (oh I need you, you got the key baby, only you can release me now)
I'm all tied up (I need your love, oh I need you to save me baby)
I just need you (oh you've got the key, come on and set me free)

(Chorus 2x)
Don't look now
I saw you dancing on that speaker box
Girl, what's your name?
I see you texting on that BBM
Can we exchange?
I got two glasses at my table
Can I show you the way?
Tonight's the night to let it go, go
Girl, it's okay
Yeah, I'm not looking for no strings
You're not looking for a ring
If you're ready for this fling
Then meet me in the back
I never knew it'd be like this
Such an unexpected twist
Started off with just a kiss
I don't know how to act
Hey, uh, I know I promised you I'd take it slow
I know I swore on everything I own
But I can't resist, how's just one kiss?
But don't look now
You've got me going, I'm going, I'm gone
Don't look now
You've got me going, I'm going, I'm gone
Don't look now
I can't resist, how's just one kiss?
Don't look now
My heart is pumping
Like that bass before I pick you up
The way we stole each other's hearts
We playing stick 'em up
I take a shot of 

[Incomprehensible]
To get me in the zone now
She took a step out the door
From head to toe she's all wow
I'm not looking for no strings
You're not looking for a ring
If you're ready for this fling
Then meet me in the back
I never knew it'd be like this
Such an unexpected twist
Started off with just a kiss
I don't know how to act
Hey, uh, I know I promised you I'd take it slow
I know I swore on everything I own
But I can't resist, how's just one kiss?
But don't look now
You've got me going, I'm going, I'm gone
Don't look now

I won't
I won't
I won't
I wooon't
Cause I came too far

(Verse 1)
Tryin to know whats goin' on
Echoes on my celluar phone
I noticed a couple items missing
Could it be the FEDS still listening?
See I done beat those cases
Dead time for the miscellaneous
And they proceed to keep on watching
Cause I done seen them lately
Interrogated my mom
Locked up half of my crew!
But I can guarantee one thing that I won't let you do!
(CHORUS)
I Won't let you lock me down
I Won't let you push me 'round
I Won't Let you stop me now
I Wooont, cause I came too far

I Won't let you ruin my day
I won't let you stop my pain
I won't, noo not today!
I woont, cause I came too far

(Verse )
Devil's always watching me (watching me)
Evil's always stocking me (stalking me)
God has been protecting me (protecting me)
And thats how I got this far
Cause when you look at me you see an angel
Can't beleive I been through half the things that I went through
Cause everyday I see your face (my face)
Keep gettin screwed by the human race (my race)
So, please don't you judge me unless you know me
Cause I won't let you...

(CHORUS)
I won't let you lock me down
I won't let you push me 'round

Came too far to turn back now (too far)
Came too Far to turn back now (too far)
Ain't no body gonna stop me (can't stop)
Ain't no body gonna stop me (can't stop)

I won't let you lock me down

Little surfer, little one
Made my heart come all undone
Do you love me, do you surfer girl?
Surfer girl, my little surfer girl
I have watched you on the shore
Standing by the ocean's roar
Do you love me, do you surfer girl?
Surfer girl, surfer girl
We could ride the surf together
While our love would grow
In my woody, I would take you
Everywhere I go
So I say from me to you
I will make your dreams come true
Do you love me, do you surfer girl?
Surfer girl, my little surfer girl
Girl, surfer girl, my little surfer girl
Girl, surfer girl, my little surfer girl
Hey, get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
C'mon get rhythm!
When you get the blues!

Get a rock and roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes, and get goin'
Get rhythm!
When you get the blues!

A little shoe-shine boy he never gets low-down
But he's got the dirtiest job in town!
Bending low at the peoples' feet
On a windy corner of a dirty street

Well, I asked him while she shined my shoes
How'd he keep from getting the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
He popped a shoe-shine rag, and he said

Get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
C'mon get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
It'll shake all your troubles from your worried mind
Get rhythm!
When you get the blues!

Get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
C'mon get rhythm!
When you get the blues!

Get a rock and roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes, and get goin'
Get rhythm!
When you get the blues!

Well, I had to listen to the shoe-shine boy
And I thought I was gonna jump for joy!
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoe-shine rag and he held it tight
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said, you're a mighty little boy to be a-workin' that way!
He said I like it, with a big wide grin
Kept on a-poppin' and he said again

Get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
C'mon get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
It only costs a dime, just a nickel a shoe
It does a million dollars worth of good for you
Get rhythm!
When you get the blues!
Got a flip-top pack of cigarettes in her pocket
Feeling good at the top
Shopping in sharp shoes
Walking in the sunshine town feeling very cool
But the butchers and the bakers in the supermarket stores
Getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

Cornering neatly she trips up sweetly
To meet the people
She's on time again
And then
I catch her by the eye then I stop and have to think
What a funny thing to do 'cause I'm feeling very pink
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

I love she
She loves me
See you
See you
See you
(Apples and oranges)
(Apples and oranges)
(Apples and oranges)
(Apples and oranges)
(Apples and oranges)

Thought you might like to know
I'm the lorry driver man
She's on the run
Down by the river side
Feeding ducks in the afternoon tide (quack quack)
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

[Lil' wayne]
This is for the lovers and the s*** mother, mothers
Love is in the air, I pray to god I do not suffer
Kay, late night, lights, steam, candles lit
She say weezy flush me harder
I say ooh, you the ooh
You commit, I commit
She say she love me, I'm convinced
Don't need a rocker scientist to see that you and I are meant
I meant to tell you, you the reason I smile more
Who I fell for, you know I beat that, beat that up
Rocky Balboa
God I'm just playing to let you win
And I can't win
If there ain't a thought about you
Hey baby, that's all I do
I put you first, now tell me though
Will never be a partner
Now I say, please girl don't you go breaking
My pretty little heart

[Robin thicke]
Tell me something sweet
Tell me something nice
Tell me something good
Baby, tell me it's alright

Tell me that you love me
Tell me you'll be there, fair
I get so worry, sometimes
The world will not be there
Tell me that I'm s***
Like I was before

Tell me I got it
That you want it even more
Tell me that you'll never, ever
Ever leave me side, side
Tell me cause you know
I need to hear it every night

Baby you got me don't worry your pretty little heart
I said
Baby you got me don't worry your pretty little heart

[Robin thicke]
Tell me who you with
Tell me where you work
Tell me did you go out
And start talking to some girl
I want to believe it
You know how hard I try
After all we've been through
We so hard to say goodbye
Tell me that the future is getting brighter now
Tell me that we'll make it
That we'll make it somehow
Tell me it's forever
That we'll never burn
Tell me that you'll never break my pretty little heart

[Chorus:]
Baby you got me don't worry your pretty little heart
And I said
Baby you got me don't worry your pretty little heart

[Robin thicke]
Tell me that's the money
Tell me I'm a star
Tell me that you'll never break my pretty little heart
Say you'll take me places
Everything's okay
Tell me cause you know I need that pump up everyday
Tell me that's your money
Won't get in our way
Tell me that the chance I take, won't blow up in my face
Tell me that you'll do it
That you'll do it real
I'll leave you if you break my pretty little heart, I will

[Chorus:]
And I said
Baby you got me don't worry your pretty little heart
I said
Baby you got me don't worry your pretty little heart
Baby you got me don't worry your pretty little heart
And I said
Baby you got me don't worry your pretty little heart

Don't you worry, your pretty little heart...
I got you, you got me
I love you, I love you, I love you baby
Everybody get down huh
Everybody get down huh
Everybody get down huh
Huh huh huh huh, Shazam!

I sneak a chicken tikka
Marsala at a gala event
I represent that's stupid that's for sure
You be like "oh yeah Adam, real mature"
I'd like a lettuce, tomato and Munster on rye
All this cheese is gonna make me cry
Gorgonzola, Provolone
Don't even get me started on this microphone
Blowin' up like my name is Joe Bazooka
I'm a super-dooper MC party pooper
On a track so slick it'll make you feel all queasy
Make you do like Fred Sanford with "I'm comin' Wheezy!"

Everybody get down huh
Everybody get down huh
Everybody get down huh
Huh huh huh huh, Shazam!
On the court I go by the name Praying Mantis
Got the edge and I've got the advantage
If you could see things from my vantage
Point then you could better understand this
I'm in the lab all day I scrabble all night
I got a bedazzler so my outfit's tight
When it comes to panache I can't be beat
I got the most style from below Fourteenth Street
Internationally known as the Keebler Elf
Can't keep a catalog up on the shelf
I splash on beats like sauce on spaghetti
Putting MC's out of business like they're Crazy Eddie

Everybody get down huh
Everybody get down huh
Everybody get down huh
Huh huh huh huh, Shazam!

I know you're sitting pretty in the Hampty Hamps
Posing like you're rolling with that camp
In layman's terms let me break it down
You're flipping and flopping just like a flounder
I'm a hip hop scholar while you're left back
So Jeckle and Rush go back to Lefrac
I'm a simple man like Chance Gardner
Working nine to five Dolly Parton
Got rhymes for jerks that's bringing on drama
Which rhyme you want first? The one about your mama?
Goodness gracious golly gee
Shazam! Freeeeeeak out with the genie!
Everybody get down huh
Everybody get down huh
Everybody get down huh
Huh huh huh huh, Shazam!

Freak out with the genie...
Swinging in the back yard
Pull up in your fast car
Whistling my name
Open up a beer and
Say get over here
And play your video game
I´m in your favorite sun dress
Watching me get undressed
Take that body down town, honey
I say you the bestest
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite purfume on
Go Play your video games
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living
If somebody is loving you
Baby now you do
Singing in the old bar
Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame
Kissing in the blue dark
Playing pool and wild darts
Video games
He holds me in his big arms
He's drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watching all our friends fall
Leaning out of old cars
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls

They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living

We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger baby
Like a stranger in Moscow

We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger baby
Like a stranger in Moscow

I'm livin' lonely
I'm livin' lonely, baby

I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feelin' insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittling me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me be
How does it feel
(How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside

Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a begger boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
In the rain, and again, and again
Take my name and just let me be

How does it feel
(How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
(How does it feel now)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside
How does it feel
(How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
(How does it feel now)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside

Like a stranger in Moscow
(Lord have mercy)
Like a stranger in Moscow
(Lord have mercy)
We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger baby

Electric shock, energy like a billion watts

Galactic comb and Mr. Spock
We bumping in your parking lot

[Verse 2: Fergie]
Parking lot
When you comin up in the spot
Don't bring nothin' we call P. Dot

[Verse 1]
In the summertime we met to see a threat
That came to harm something we both loved
And as the hours passed
We talked until at last it came a time to part

[Chorus]
I was doin' well and I thought she liked my style
I had no business feeling like that but it lasted quite a while
I got my promises made but before the timeless father
I showed plastic flowers to mother nature's daughter

[Post Chorus]
She held the vase, her misty gaze brought them to life
I was amazed, she looked at me with a tear in her eye

[Verse 2]
We went to give our thanks along the riverbanks
And watched the water flow as it rolled along
She scooped some river sand and held it in her hand
And sang a little song
We saw the water lines left there from ancient times
I watched the sand falling through her fingers
On the shore, so dry

[Chorus]
I was doin' well, I thought she liked my style
I had no business feeling like that but it lasted quite a while
I got my promises made but before the timeless father
I showed plastic flowers to mother nature's daughter

[Meek Mill]
See, I'm an A1 type of guy
I crush A1 hoes (true)
Rock A1 clothes (true)
Drive A1 whips (true)
And still pour A1 sauce on my shit
Huh, I come from the bottom

Huh, crushing all these hoes, rocking all this ice
Selling all these Os, nigga, I done did that twice
So I'm just riding round in my Rolls, bout to get on my bike
Just to touchdown in my hood, and I put that on my life
I'm like, yeah nigga, I'm there nigga, I ball hard all year nigga
My diamonds all clear nigga, smack my chain, you dead nigga
I don't know what you heard, and I don't know what you thought
But all my dogs they murk, and all my dogs go hard, fuck that
My new young chick look exactly like Rihanna
Ass like Nicki, but she yellow like Madonna
I take her to the mall, buy her all type of designers
YSL, fly Chanel, all that Dolce & Gabbana
I jump right back like thirty-six, lean hard when I turn the whip
If I ain't have my rap deal, then I'd still be serving bricks
I kill a pussy, I murder shit, homicide on shorty
My gold Role' cost sixty racks and my rose gold cost forty

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I get A1 money, I'm an A1 nigga
Got an A1 swagger, I'm getting A1 bitches
I just bought me a Rollie, you can skate on nigga
If they don't love it, they hate it, well get your hate on nigga
Cause I got A1 everything, A1 everything
A1 everything, I get A1 everything
I got A1 credit, A1 hoes
I drive A1 whips and I rock A1 clothes, I'm gone

[Kendrick Lamar]
Pray to God I washed my hand, but I'll be damned
2012, one-hundred racks to Uncle Sam
A twenty-four year old millionaire
Don't read the contract 'less a mill in there
A1 credit, park my car bow-legged
I got a bus full of bitches, I call it Jerome Bettis
I grab my dick in the picture, your hoe be cropping the image
I'll let you scrape off the dishes, we eating nigga, I'll finish
And come right back, hope you insomniac
Sleep on me if you wanna take a dirt nap
Bitch I'm talking ca-ca-ca-ca, then more ca-ca-ca-ca
Hit your roof until I pop your top up, then more ca-ca-ca-ca till I know I got ya
Balling like I'm balding, then I see Jordan in the mirror
Nigga that's flawless VVS, said CC text me what you wearing
Putting my all inside your bitch, I grip her hips, that's power steering
Bout to hydroplane when I board that plane, I land inside the building

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Well, since she put me down I've been out doin' in my head
Come in late at night and in the mornin' I just lay in bed
Well, Rhonda, you look so fine (look so fine)
And I know it wouldn't take much time
For you to help me, Rhonda
Help me get her out of my heart

[Chorus]
Help me, Rhonda
Help, help me, Rhonda
Help me, Rhonda
Help, help me, Rhonda
Help me, Rhonda
Help, help me, Rhonda
Help me, Rhonda
Help, help me, Rhonda
Help me, Rhonda
Help, help me, Rhonda
Help me, Rhonda
Help, help me, Rhonda
Help me, Rhonda, yeah
Get her out of my heart
She was gonna be my wife
And I was gonna be her man
But she let another guy come between us
And it ruined our plan
Well, Rhonda, you caught my eye (caught my eye)
And I can give you lots a reasons why
You gotta help me, Rhonda
Help me get her out of my heart

[Chorus x 2]
Help me, Rhonda
Help, help me, Rhonda
Help me, Rhonda
Help, help me, Rhonda
Help me, Rhonda
Help, help me, Rhonda
Help me, Rhonda
Help, help me, Rhonda
Tuning in the latest star
From the dashboard of my car
Cruisin' at seven
Push button heaven
Capturing memories from afar
In my car
That's why God made the radio
So tune right in, everywhere you go
He waved His hand, gave us rock 'n roll
The soundtrack of falling in love
That's why God made the radio
Feel the music in the air
Find a song to take us there
It's paradise when I lift up my antenna
Receiving your signal like a prayer
Like a prayer
That's why God made the radio
So tune right in, everywhere you go
He waved His hand, gave us rock 'n roll
The soundtrack of falling in love
That's why God made the radio
Making this night a celebration
Spreading the love and sunshine
To a whole new generation
Whole new generation
That's why God made
That's why God made
That's why God made the radio
That's why God made (the radio)
That's why God made
That's why God made the radio (for fallin' in love)
That's why God made (the radio)
That's why God made
That's why God made the radio
That's why God made (the radio)
That's why God made (God made)
That's why God made the radio (for fallin' in love)
If you ever change your mind
About leaving, leaving me behind
Bring it to me, bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me, yeah

You know I tried to treat you right
But, you stayed out, stayed out every night
Bring it to me, bring your sweet lovin
Bring it on home to me

I know I laughed when you left
But now I know I only hurt myself
Baby, bring it to me

That ain't all, all I do for you
Baby if you bring it to me

Bring it to me, bring your sweet loving

Put up your hands youknowhatI'msayin'?
I'ma start this shit off like this, this time around

Live or die, it's nothin' but a dark side
Fugees on the mic, yeah, yeah
Yo', refugees on the mic, oh yeah, oh yeah
If you wanna snap, SNAP, if you wanna crack, CRACK
If you wanna shoot, give me a second so I can lay flat
Cause this, some the cemetary's, the reality
Where the tough guys get buried in their property
Word to Sampson, the tone will get you hung
I had a friend, they murdered his father and his three year old son
I heard him cursin' the essence of the, the committed the crime
But ah, murder got no time
The country has no law, it's either rich or poor
I'm out the back door, I got nuttin' to fight for
I'm sailin' on a boat like a goat, I clear my throat
When I got to Brooklyn, I was broke, so I selled coke
I look in through microscope, for my country and the hurt
My eyes bleed, I see Aaron Steed, the Haitian Pope
Figure or Dundee, the riginal Malcom X
Swing like the ki's, so should I put on David Tomerfest
Though I'm humberlicious strugglin' to jump
Let me blow her upper her bubble in your face, that'cha ego
Aiyyo, freeze funk, you got to stay stable
Watch out for the devil, he comes after you after the revival
When will he come, what will he do, what will he say?
That's all a mystery, but have your hand grenade
So you can blow the motherfucker away
Beep, beep, I gotta make a sale so I can eat
So Praswell, grab the mic and be complete
Huh, lovin' the wreck in effect, will be all in checkmate
Another style for Praswell to translate
For those who can't relate to stay down my, no man wait
No mistake, when I tell you, your prophet is a fake
You said a contract on a Haitian, three hundred g's
Your sharpshooters are lousy, we mend to high be high hoodies
So show your face a when you waste, I know who's smokin'
The bigger that you try to put out yours just makes me Mr. Nobody
Take high wit'cha just right, it'll be like Michael get ordered, a viper you know
Yeah, a viper cause you might lose a life to the side by like
What did I have to in the line of the barkin' of the bright side
You tried to scare me but I won't mover a
The bully of the block becomes the hour of the Glock
So cuckooThe sounds I run are rollin' with the bodyguard
But don't forget the day it's sunny but it'll be foggy
And in the funeral, you'll be singin' a new tune
May your soul rest on the moon, Jack in wood spoon
In Channel Seven, you said Death before Cut
You killed so many that your conscience ended up, whattup? WHAT
Aiyyo black men, you're dyin' by a dozen cousin
So all I do is walk away yo' Prince as if nothin' happened
You call me a punk, I gotta step cause all you did was flex
But don't get closer cause the kid still gotta keep his rep
See I'm known for the crew like the jewel was the jewel
Like the follow got the boo, like the miller got the boo
Let the fool cop the man jewel, suck up, up the ?cool-lew?
Oh why you got the ha ha lew lew?
I got the rap loose, so sci bi dee bob bob, you don't stop
You do the rap rap, from hip hop to be bop, from be bop
To beep beep, the Haitian kid, beeper's goin' off beep beep
I gotta make a sale so I can eat, beep, beep
The Haitian kid, beeper's goin' off, you know I got no time to sleep, so beep beep
H to the A to the I to the T to the I
Live or die, it's nothin' but a dark side
Fugees on the mic, YEAH
Yo', refugees on the mic, oh yeah, oh yeah
Man, I went to cops the other day to plead for my innocence
They brought me in another charges of a legal residents
And L, E, N, on a foreign land
Watch me go back to my land and then there will be a thing
Gorillas in the mist, where everything, and the light becomes a priest
They put up they guard, they pump up they fists
Now I'm number one on they motherfuckin' hit list
Goin' down for first degree of manslaughter
Makin' change out of emcee's makin' them outta quarters
That's they value, that's what they worth
Cause the first shall be last and the last shall be first, yeah
What we learned was to burn, now cause you c came
With that machette, it's your turn
It's not funny, but twenty a month is what you earn baby
We on to the Yankee, pass the mic to the, Yankee
Well I'm as cool to ya the mic I'm checkin' comin' from my temple
With a message, to deliver, but the back is very simple
I'm the girl, Yankee, rollin' wit' the kids from Haiti
Coolin' as a mighty grab who gets the last laugh hahaha
You bite size with my Haitian from they stinks as my, Yankee
Wonderin' who was the first to pull over girl as soon as it came out son
My history, a hypocrite, so what we gonna do?
The dope is dope is only get the man since that is true
So hip hip with my lip as I rip with a felt tip
With a righteous situation, interpretation, a graduation
Your ventilation, and education, segregation, emancipation
A capitalization, it's agration, not separation, ya breath the Haitians
H to the A to the I to the T to the I
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue
Because you treat me like shit
I paid for the bed and never even slept in it
I paid for that crib and never stepped foot in
And now somebody else is eating all the pudding
Things change, now my dashboard wooden
All black Benz, like a young Doc Gooden
Dark shades, cause I'm stone crazy
Girl, we grown, stop playing on my phone, baby
All your childish attempts to make me angry fall short
Which only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing
Understandable, I'm shining brilliant with five Brazilians
There were times I used to hide my feelings
Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini
And motherfuckers can't see me
Wait 'til this chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy
Who would've thought I hit you right back?
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue
So many women wanna call me baby
And you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately
Some would say that I'm the symbol for sex and uh
Others would hate, but I don't give 'em no breath
Go on a date, I'm at the crib with the chef and uh, that's me
And you could order whatever
The specialty is white snake and underwear sauce
You could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next
And I understand that's only cause I'm popular
I'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera
As Bocelli sings the celly rings
I gotta go, you'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king
I'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous, just like a horse is
I know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous
Still I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue
I hope you get a paper cut on your tongue
From a razor in a paper cup
I hope every soda you drink already shaken up
I hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun
I hope your titties all saggy in your early 20's
I hope there's always snow in your driveway
I hope you never get off Fridays
And you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays
I hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket
I hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen
I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck
And your headphones short, and your charger don't work
And you spill shit on your shirt
I hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face
Cut my losses, how Delilah changed my locks to a fade
I hope you happy, I hope you happy
I hope you ruined this shit for a reason, I hope you happy, igh
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue
La la la la
I'm dangerous, so dangerous
I'm dangerous, you better stay away
Stay away from me
I'm dangerous
I'm dangerous, so dangerous
You're a lone hitchhiker and I'm a traveling truck
You better not get on this ride, you might lose your luck
I'm dangerous
You better heed the signs, the skull and cross bow nights
Stop lights and yields, I'm slippery when wild
Cautions and red flags, I'm gonna cross that line
I'm dangerous
So don't you, don't you say baby
Baby I'm crazy, crazy for wanting
Wanting you badly, madly i'm serious
And you're so curious but i'm too dangerous
You better not kiss me once, you better not fall in love
I'm a pterodactyl and you're a wandering dove
I don't mean to be greedy but it's never enough
I'm dangerous
I'll tell you I love you and I'll believe it's true
Then I'll do something so bad to you
And you'll say I hate you and you'll be screaming in a dream
Where no one can hear you
So don't you, don't you say baby
Baby I'm crazy, crazy for wanting
Wanting you badly, madly I'm serious
And you're so curious but I'm too dangerous
You're idealistic so filled with glee
You see me as you're shining prince
But I'm a treacherous king
You'll accept my olive branch but I'm poison ivy
I'm dangerous, so dangerous
I'm dangerous, so dangerous
You better stay away, stay away from me
I'm dangerous
When I was a little bitty baby my mama would rock me in my cradle
In them old cottonfields back home
When I was a little bitty baby...
Now when them cotton bolls get rotten you can't pick very much cotton
In them old cottonfields back home
It was down in Louisiana just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cottonfields back home

When I was a little bitty baby...
When I was a little bitty baby...
In them old cottonfields back home in them old cottonfields back home
We be the illest
We be the illest in here
I know you feel us
We be the illest in here
Illest in here
We so motherfuckin' ill
We so motherfuckin' ill
Ill, motherfucker, ill
We so motherfuckin' ill
Illin' out from LA, I be illin' out all the way
Got an email from my K-Town chick that wanna hook up and blaze
I've got OG cannabis, girl, one puff will put you in your grave
Got three pills and four jimmy hats 'cause we don't Kid n Play
Hop out, yo, guess who's gettin' drunk?
No motherfuckers can out drink us
If you're tipping that heat, don't get drowned
So cold, polar bears on my nuts
Y'all know just who we be
I hold it down for the East
'Cause I keeps it pimpin', Peter Griffin
Yellow tinted on zebras
Dripping on your couches
Dripping on your couches
Sippin' Tanqueray with orange, mane, we on that Tropicana
I'm dripping on your couches from the Hills to public housing
If you're feelin' ill, then damn, you ill
Be the illest on the thousand
We be the illest
We be the illest in here
I know you feel us
We be the illest in here
Illest in here

I know you feel us
We be the illest in here

We so motherfuckin' ill
Nice chain, what a nice night
My ice bright, I play the wall like a night light
Tangerine, tambourine from the West Wing
The best thing about my room, Versace bed springs
I'm in the building, more gold than Rumpelstiltskin
Aw shit, look who it is, the white Russell Simmons
Jody Highroller, Far East Movement
We so ill, I think I need some codeine fluid
Dripping on your couches
Dripping on your couches
Sippin' Tanqueray with orange, mane, we on that Tropicana
I'm dripping on your couches from the Hills to public housing
If you're feelin' ill, then damn, you ill
Be the illest on the thousand
We be the illest
We be the illest in here
I know you feel us

I is for the way these bitches love how I bang
And double L is for the way I blow the smoke in your face
We roll on Es and we be easy rollin' that bank
And ST is for the illest shit we rep every day
Well deep down in Lousiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods neath the evergreens
There stood an old cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B Goode
He never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell
Go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go go Johnny go go Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
He sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
The engineer would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' through the rhythm that the drivers made
The people passin' by they would stop and say
Oh my how that little country boy can play
Go go go Johnny go go...

Well now his mama told him someday you gonna be a man
You will be the leader of a country band
The people gonna come from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be at lights sayin' Johnny B. Goode shakin' tonight
Go go go Johnny go go...
Some hope for the future
Some wait for the call
To say that the days ahead
Will be the best of all
We will build bridges
Up to the sky
Heavenly lights surrounding
You and I
From out of the darkness
Our future will come
If we leave the past behind
We'll fly beyond the sun
We'll be together
Sharing the load
Watching in wonder
As our lives unfold
Hope for the future
It's coming soon enough
How much can we achieve?
Hope for the future
It will belong to us
If we believe
If we believe
Hope shines brightest in the dark
When nothing's ever seen
Lighting undiscovered places
No-one's ever been
Some hope for the future
Some wait for the call
To say that our destiny
Will be the best of all
And we will build bridges
Up to the sky
And heavenly lights
Surrounding you and I
Hope shines brightest in the dark
Where nothing's ever seen
Lighting undiscovered places
No-one's ever been
Hope for the future
Hope for the future
Hope for the future
There's a world where
I can go and
Tell my secrets to
In my room
In my room

In this world I
Lock out all my
Worries and my fears
In my room
In my room

Do my dreaming and my scheming
Lie awake and pray?
Do my crying and my sighing
Laugh at yesterday?

Now it's dark and
I'm alone but
I won't be afraid
In my room
In my room
In my room, in my room
In my room, in my room
INTRO:
Yeah... Ay... Real talk right here nigga
King shit right here nigga... That's right
Grand Hustle right here nigga... That's right
You don't like it steer clear nigga...
There's only one Bankhead nigga... Center Hill
Tags on my drought(?) show
Walkin' through the mall blow
Snoop:
Hear ye, hear ye, come one come all
It's the first annual g, nigga, and all my doggs
Are invited, so go and enlight it
Cause it's the first time in a long time (right)
Reminiscing about the fresh fest back in '85
When the dubs and the san dieg's used to hoo ride
On motherfuckers like it was the thing to do
Eighty-five, eighty-fo', eight-tray, in year eighty-two (eighty-two)
You know what the fuck I'm talking about
After party on the lake at the big homie's house
And bet nobody bring a motherfucking gun
Cause everybody in the house's from two-one...
Tray deee:
Twenty-first street, burst street, where it all started
And you know east side, long beach, the hardest
Niggas coming realer than the real mccoy
So step with your rap and we bring the noise
It's the gang of fly bitches, homiez on the switches
Dice in the back if ya wanna get your riches
No snitches allowed inside the crowd
Cause this is the g thang, east side l.b.c. brang
In to have some fun represent two-one
And bet nobody bring a mothafucking gun and a...
Snoop:
Yeah, king park was the location
And the bigga g that was my destination
(we were) lookin up to niggas coming up before me
And l.b.c. into my east side homies..... (it's like)
Nobody can see you, but you (yeah, the east side's perfect)
Nobody can see you, but you (ha ha, now that's worth it)
Nobody can see you, but you (hell yeah, the east side's perfect)
Nobody can see you, but you (ha ha, yeah, now that's worth it)
Tatatata.....
Snoop (tray):
If ya bring a strap, then ya have to trip
(so if you're on a mission nigga, go on and dip)
We got meat to eat, (freaks to meet)
And chronic we can smoke on, (if I ever get a loc on)
Strolling through the park one day
Puffing on a fat ass j. with my homie named tray
Deee tryin' to see if we could put this lbc thing
Back together like it was supposed to see
Tray:
Cause ya know I'm down with ya to make 'em get the picture
And if I have to sit ya down then I spit ya
Game from the heart, I came from the start
See I was regulating when crackers was the daily's
Snoop:
Nigga let me interact with my black croaker sacks*
And a gray golf hat tilted to the back (what's up? )
Ditchin' Sunday school to get a pack of now and laters
While I'm rolling with the stealers and killin' with the raiders
Tray:
And when we bang with the saints then we ain't no joke
Come around from outta bounds and we goes for broke
Now we're breaking 'em up (hmm hmm), shaking em up (yeah)
And just for a second we're waking 'em up
(continue) giving up game on his tired ass feet
With a small dedication to two-one street
Listen very carefully, my words are about to unfold
Concerning a lady I've seen but I never could hold
I can see by your smile
Take a long while
The words that come through
I see that they're true
For she reminds me of you

Don't misunderstand me, it's not always easy to say
The words in your head and your heart that you just can't explain
I can see clearly
A face in the sky
Moon's in your eye
You're passing me by
Tell me the reason why

I can see clearly
A face in the sky
Moon's in your eye
You're passing me by
Saw you riding on a moon cloud
Saw you walking on a whirlpool
From the corner of my eye
I saw you

Saw you sitting on a sunbeam
In the middle of my daydream
Oh my Lady Fantasy
I love you
{*Teedra Moses harmonizes throughout the song*}

"What is this?"

"I like this Maybach Music"
"Sweet!"

[Intro: Rick Ross]
Self made...
Gotta handle your own... {M-M-M-Maybach Music}
{J-J-J-J-J-Just Blaze} ...I'mma handle mine

[Wale] + (Rick Ross)
They tried and tell me I don't fit up in this motha fucka
Cause Rozay been talkin white he think he Uncle Ruckus (HUH)
I left Jimmy, they was spending silly with my budget
And now I'm rolling with some cooler niggas I can fuck with (HUH)
You by the cooler yea you niggas don't get no tick
Bitch I think I'm Teen Wolf, a dog nigga, ballin' bitch (HUH)
Fly as Ricky steam boat, me and my Moschino
I dont wear no 501's: 1000 dollar jeans flow (WHOO)
It's funny how Pucci made all the snakes gone (WHOO)
I'm winning cause Ricky made my mistakes known (WHOO)
Its funny that since I put this chain on
These bitches appear quicker than state farm
Wale Folarin somethin they can't ever smoke
Weed I can't pronounce man this shit would leave Rosetta stoned
This man can single handedly save the culture (HUH)
You got no spark you need some lighter man you Sammy Sosa
So get it right ok you ballin and I'm with the owners
You know my drive is retarded like I'm riding doughnuts
Picture me rollin': young, handsome and focused
Got that vision of Pac and though my branding is Oprah
Michelangelo portrait meet Maya Angelou notebook
Michael Jordan performance nigga I dream to be all of it (WHOO)
Yea, I'm just a poet with some hangtime
I dont really shakespeare, I just shake dice (HUH)
Miami nights, made a couple grand (right)
Private plane TSA can kiss my ass (haha)
Lord forgive me I'm trying, know I ain't living right (HUH)
But this card I'm trickin' with got no limit right
In this life you dead wrong or ain't living right
They on my ass like a center make them take a hike

[Meek Mill] + (Rick Ross)
(All we wanted was opportunity; Lord knows~!)
It's MMG baby - the dream team (better believe)

Uh, I made it myself, guess I'm self made (HUH)
Fire starter put me anywhere I just blaze
Dropped out of school never made it to the 12th grade
I'm so fucking raw haters hoping that I catch AIDS (WHOO)
Motivated just from being broke (WHOO)
Had a dream like Martin Luther, little bit of hope
If Rosa never rolled and Malcolm never spoke
They'd probably find me in the woods hanging from a rope
Instead they lock me in the cell just for sellin dope
When people used to ask if I was high, I would tell them no
Cause I was never hesitant to represent
Devil knocking at the door screaming let me in
Tell the owner hit the lights when we stepping in
Charlie Sheen on them haters, they dont wanna let me win
Nah, niggas they dont wanna let me win
But I'mma build it ground up, (let's again)
I kill these rappers early in the game, abortion
Spit a verse like lemme get ya fam, extortion
Send these niggas back to when they came, deportion
Make'm forefeit and I'm porshin 600 horses
911, somebody call 'em
Kemba Walker cross em over, somebody fallin
Jump back, I hit the shot, somebody ballin
I'm at the dealer and I hear that Maserati callin
Black and white diamonds looking like my neck be vollyballin
And this presi lookin like somebody pottied on it
I don't gotta join illuminati just to get a new Bugatti
I'm just ridin I done put a thousand miles on my body

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
Born to win - look around
From the projects to the penthouse
Our vision never changed, we self made
Count that up - HUH~!

[Pill] + (Rick Ross)
Hah, self made self paid man
P-I double L in the building
(ATL) Go on and get yo muthafuckin roll on...

8 in the morning when that street clock bust: kitchen overload
Door knob turns; the aisle burn baking soda pourin'
The clientele buy and sell like a pawn shop
Profit margings increase, exit the V wit my gun out
Out witted, out foxed you over matched
House hidden, drop tops the sofas match
This is fine dine take out, first date make out
Diamonds blind the lens and camera men on the stakeout
As I enter the steak house pockets on humongo
Philosphical drama and wildin known as the congo?
Africana, Black as Ghana, be my attire
Mary water, marajuana that stick to get higher?
We blow stress through the vents of the Marriott (HUH)
We self made, carry on while we carry out

[Outro: Rick Ross]
If I woke up tomorrow and didn't have a dolla..
As long as I have my heart, I can get it all over
Dream team - we the '93 Chicago Bulls baby
The lovely Teedra Moses, self made...

{M-M-M-Maybach Music}
It's not a put-down
I put my foot down
And then I make-a some love, I put my root down
I’m like "Sweetie Pie" by the Stone Alliance
Everybody know I'm known for dropping science
‘Cause I'm electric like Dick Hyman
I guess you'd expect to catch the crew rhymin'
Never let you down with the stereo sound
So, Mike, get on the mic and turn it out

We're talking root down, I put my boot down (boot down)
And if you want to battle me, you're putting loot down (loot down)
I said it’s root down, it's time to scoot down (scoot down)
I'm-a step up to the mic in my goose down (goose down)
Come up representing from the upper west
Money making putting me to the test
Sometimes I feel as though I've been blessed
Because I'm doing what I want so I never rest (yeah, Mike it, Mike it)

Well, I ain't going out goofy like the Fruit of the Loom guys
Just strutting like The Meters with the “Look-ka Py Py"
Cause downtown Brooklyn is where I was born
But when the snow is fallin’, then I am gone (oh weee)
You might think that I'm a fanatic
A phone call from Utah and I'm throwing a panic
So break it to the root when we kick it on down
Jimmy Smith is my man, I want to give him a pound
I kick it root down

Well, Adrock (huh)
Don't stop, come on
Just get on the mic with the tic and the toc

I'll fill you to the fuckin' rim like Brim
I'm walking down your block and you say, "That's him
There goes the guy with the funky sound"
The Beatsie Boys, you know we come to get down
Because I've got the flow where I grab my dick
And say “Oh my god, that's the funky shit!"
So I’m-a pass the mic and cause a panic (yeah)
The original nasal kid is doing damage

Every morning I took the train to High Street Station
Doing homework on the train, what a fucked up situation
On the way back up, hearing battle tapes
Through the underground, underneath the sky scrapes
It's like Harlem World Battles on the Zulu Beat Show
It's Kool Moe Dee vs. Busy Bee
There's one you should know, (yeah)
Enough of that, I just want to give some respect due
MCA, grab the mic and Ma Bell will connect you

Bob Marley was a prophet for the freedom fight
"If dancin' prays to the lord then I will feel alright"
I'm feelin' good to play a little music (music)
Tears running down my face ‘cause I love to do it (love to do it)
And no one can stop this flow from flowing on
A flow master of disaster with a sound that's gone (yeah)
Tick a little shout out to my dad and mom (yeah)
For bringing me into this world and so on
I kick it root down
(Intro: dj Scream & Verse Simmonds)

I’m richer than the average nigga, baby I wouldn’t lie to you
When I say you fine as fuck, baby girl I ain’t tryna flatter you
But yo boyfriend is a rainbow and he tryin to overshadow you
Gucci Mane splatter you, I’m the one she walkin to

See I got enough to get yo life right
Money make you come, we gon be fuckin all night
You gon love me, you gon love me
You gon love me, you gon love me

[Verse 1]
The young man stands on the edge of his porch
The days were short and the father was gone
There was no one in the town and no one in the field
This dusty barren land had given all it could yield
I've been kicked off my land at the age of sixteen
And I have no idea where else my heart could have been
I placed all my trust at the foot of this hill
And now I am sure my heart can never be still
So collect your courage and collect your horse
And pray you never feel this same kind of remorse

[Instrumental]
One, two, three...

[Chorus]
Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Well you are my accuser, now look in my face
Your oppression reeks of your greed and disgrace
So one man has and another has not
How can you love what it is you have got
When you took it all from the weak hands of the poor?
Liars and thieves you know not what is in store
Oh, there will come a time I will look in your eye
You will pray to the God that you always denied
Then I'll go out back and I'll get my gun
I'll say, "You haven't met me, I am the only son"

[Chorus]
Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Seal my heart and break my pride
I've nowhere to stand and now nowhere to hide
Align my heart, my body, my mind
To face what I've done and do my time

[Outro]
Well yes sir, yes sir, yes it was me
I know what I've done, 'cause I know what I've seen
I went out back and I got my gun
I said, "You haven't met me, I am the only son"
Thank you very much!
I fucked this girl in Talahassee
Doggie style so i named her Lassie
Came on her, florida state clothes
Filled up all her semen holes
Fucked this girl from purdue
Came in her hair, fucked up her doo
She was cryin, like tammy faye baker
Her pussy got hotter than a boiler maker
Met Santa's daughter in Baton Rouge
Fucked up Christmas like Mr. Scrooge
Dropped her off at LSU
Smoked all her weed, drank all her brew
Fucked George Bush daughter in Dallas, Texas
Rode that ass just like a Lexus
Fucked her again in ft. worth
Stuck my dick in her pussy and I started to surf

(CHORUS)
Colt 45, Afroman
Tryin to get all the pussy that I can
To the cross country in my Afro van
SMOKIN WEED
2X

I priced this hooker in Ohio
I said, Bitch, you too high Ho
I got a cheaper ho in Cincinatti
Fucked her in the back of my 83 Caddy
Broker as hell smokin Newport singles
Came in her ass and said "Fuck the Bengals"

(afroman rant)

SMOKIN WEED!

Smokin weed, State-to-State
Beer and munchies got me gaining weight
Missionary style in chilla coffee
Little mamma said, "would you please get off me"
Beatutiful girl, Iowa City
Roll a blunt fatter than a big fat titty
She sucked my dick, while she held my thighs
I came in her Iowa Hawk-"Eyes"
My dick went BOING in Des Moines
Going going go-Buckaw!

SMOKIN WEED!
(CHORUS 2x)
Oklahoma, Smoke-lahoma
Buffalo, Puff-alo
Fort Smith, Fort Spliff
Smokin weed
Starkville, Sparks-ville
Huntsville, Blunts-ville
Mississippi, Missi-hippie

Smokin weed

[Snoop Dogg]
Some of 'em lie about the shit they got and what they do on the block
Some of 'em lie about the guns they pop
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life
So many niggas wanna play but still got dues to pay
Some of 'em gotta beg a bitch to stay
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life
Now this is for the B's and the C's, and the D's and the H's
And the G's puttin work in overseas
At ease with the Doggy and smoke some weed
Fuck it, if my nigga detoxing, it's more for me
Baby this is presidential really
A pocket full of women understanding how I'm living
Show them hoes how you winning
It's the beginning with the pearls you're given
The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon
But everyday like 50 say, it's +Many Men+
They wanna take me out the spot, they want the pussy and the ends
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs
Then the hoes, then the clothes, I'ma have to let 'em go
You know how the Dogg roll.. don't get it twisted
'Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit
A touch of the exquisite, mixed with somethin pimpish
And it's comin from the Beach where them niggas is a beast
But I just listen, all that shit is in my past
I'm connected to the purse first nigga.. the ass last
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise
Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish

[Chorus: Akon]
See me man, I'm nothin like you
Gotta gotta the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
I'm leanin in my ride, fo' fifth, cock bangin
Me, I'm ridin by ya on the corner, block slangin
I'm livin that boss' life 

[life]
The hoes come runnin when they see me comin
I'm livin that boss' life 

[life]
You can have anything just don't fuck with my money 

[my money]

This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South
Khaki's and them Tim's and them niggas with the platinum mouths
Thinkin that they blessed by the actions that be comin out
When you in Magic City you be carrying a lot of clout
But trickin ain't the route 

[route], that's even if you got it
There's a method to you holdin it when they can't do without it
Just put the key up in it nigga if she 'bout it
You can have her and her partner, fuckin with it for a dolla
If she a balla, she gon' ride with a shot caller
Roll with the Bo$$ Dogg in the back of a blue Impala
And if she follow.. then she gon' swallow
All the game you got to give her, be a different bitch tomorrow
But I would never bother breakin out 

[Tha Doggfather]
'Less I knew that she was 'bout him, havin diamonds on his collar
I'm just an author, spreading game to my partners
Walkin on the blue carpet with the Doctor 

[Doctor

[Chorus: Akon]
See me man, I'm nothin like you
Gotta gotta the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
I'm leanin in my ride, fo' fifth, cock bangin
Me, I'm ridin by ya on the corner, block slangin
I'm livin that boss' life 

[life]
The hoes come runnin when they see me comin
I'm livin that boss' life 

[life]
You can have anything just don't fuck with my money 

[my money]
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide I
Don't have much money but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor but then again no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
Oh I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song
And this one's for you
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that
Keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting
But these things I do
You see I've forgotten
If they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
Well never know
What lies ahead tomorrow
But you're not alone
Where ever you go
I follow

Well never know
What lies ahead tomorrow
But you're not alone
Where ever you go
I follow

You're not alone
You're not alone
I woke up this mornin' in a terrible mood
Now you talk about a woman treatin' a good man rude
She had me talkin' to myself gazin' at that mean ol' wall
She had another daddy waitin' down at the end of the hall

She changes with the weather like the leaves I recall
She blossoms in the spring but then she's gone in the fall
A two timin' woman with a heart of solid stone
She tells me that she loves me but her heart's a little under grown

Well, she said she'd never leave me but she got the urge to roam
She drifts around the country like a steamboat on a foam
She never changes course, she just goes along that same ol' way
And I hope she keeps a driftin' rolls along back home someday

'Cause if I ever find her, gonna chain her to the floor
And tell her, "Now sit there, woman, you ain't leavin' no more
I'm gonna tame your mama till you're eatin' from my hand
It's not that I don't love you, honey, it's just to make you understand"

Yes, I woke up this mornin' in a terrible mood
You talk about a woman treatin' a good man rude
She had me talkin' to myself gazin' at that mean ol' wall
She had another daddy waitin' down at the end of the hall
Usually I make a weed song so here go a weed song 

[2x]

[Chorus]
Still blazin, still blazin, still blazin
Cause jah jah power it's so amazin
Give I di strength and protection, keep praisin
Each and everyday

[2x]
Why can't everyone just smoke like me?
Just gimme a quiet place and lemme roll my weed
Where ain't nobody in my business don't nobody gotta know
Let all your conscious go and blow it by the O
I'm here but my minds gone
And it's gettin hard to see you cause my eyes low
Marijuana minutes, nigga time slow
On a kush clock, there's always time to smoke
Say I look high? I say I'm high bro
Still blazin on with me, just facin
I remember days when I could only smoke on occasion
I couldn't wait to go and cop from ray and them
Rollin blunts of 50, stuck in my moms basement
Had dro for sale but niggas was smokin haze then
Blew a O a day then, don't know but somehow I made away
And nigga them bills need pay but ah

[Chorus]
Still blazin, still blazin, still blazin
Cause jah jah power it's so amazin
Give I di strength and protection, keep praisin
Each and everyday

[2x]
Why can't everyone just smoke like me?
Just gimme a quiet place and lemme roll my weed
Where ain't nobody in my business don't nobody gotta know
Let all your conscious go and blow it by the O
I'm here but my minds gone
400 a zip that's what I'm on
And I'm gonna re-up as soon as the fires gone
Smokin og kush from another time zone
As the smoke begins to pile on
Wettin rags and puttin bags over the fire alarm
You niggas styrofoam, lightweight
I'm on my 13th oz, quite baked
You probably go to sleep, ya throat might ache
You off that good weed, you need a nice break
See I roll jays up all day and you gonna have to put a 8th in
They sayin it's amazin how ah

[Chorus]
Still blazin, still blazin, still blazin
Cause jah jah power it's so amazin
Give I di strength and protection, keep praisin
Each and everyday

[Verse 1: Wanya]
I was young (BOP)
And didn't have no where to run
I needed to wake up (Wake up) and see (And see)
What's in front of me (na-na-op)
There had to be a better way
Sing it again a better way
To show I'm grateful (hum)
So I thought up this song
To show my appreciation for lovin' me so long
You don't know much you mean to me

[Chorus: All]
'Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)

[Verse 2: Wanya & Mike]
All through my life
I knew that you'd be my world
Knowing everywhere I go
Things you taught me they would show
So many times and changes
You've seen me through
I sho nuff couldn't have survived without you, you
And so I thought up this song
To show my appreciation for lovin' me so long
You don't know how much you mean to me, oh

[Chorus: All]
'Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)
'Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)

[Break: Harmonies]

[Chorus: All]
'Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)

I know who you are, and I know what you're feelin'

Bad day, at work, crazy boss, crazy or worse
Finger, pointin', but they, they depend on you
Inhale, exhale, in and out, like a seal
No no, aw yes, smile honey, no stress
Your environment seems to get brighter
You know it's good
And the situation doesn't seem that bad

Your environment seems to get brighter

Mothafuckin' murderer

Murdered my sister the only thing
I'm trying to tell is to take it to that, nigga
Get that mutherfucker what I tell myself
Make that mutherfucka feel what Chell felt
Heavenly father but your will to bring them tears to her eyes
Fuck the fussing and the fights why she have to die
Couldn't believe my, baby, to leave away from here so goddamn early
I tried to tell her that nigga was bad news but she ain't heard me
Fact was that she love this bitch
But she found love on the graveyard shift
And how many mutherfuckin' quick lift or spliff on the fifth
Find my, baby, sister she ain't deserve that shit
Nigga, you couldn't of nigga, you wouldn't
Put your hand on a woman how could it be my sister
Can't say I wouldn't miss her but I wouldn't forget cha
Get that bitch for every time he hit, ya he gone pay for what he did, ya

[Verse 2]
Possessed that nigga that hurt her 100%
Black Queen self every women
Nigga, you lost your fuckin' life when you took hers
From her you took her from her brothers
And her baby, mother from her
But after it's said and done your ass gone burn like it's summer
Even a fuck 'bout a system, sister was your victim
Fuck, he said, he did it what the fuck you mean you're being a victim
Fuck him I'll get 'em be that nigga, to deal with him
Cut him and split him reverse that feelin'
Committed mutherfuckin' centuries under my ceilin'
The paper said, lacerations to her what did the killin'
But thats on my first born to make him my first blood
Nigga, you took her from her fuckin' close friends and first cous'
She would probably miss my partner she was cool
With multiplied by the people she went to school
With never the less rest my sweet sister
I'm about to handle this business
Get that thing and kiss ya, picture
Heavenly father he done put me in that water
But I got to get that bitch for what he did
To my momma daughter
Never dreamed he'd be the one to hurt her
She died a bloody murder

[Verse 3]
Into the tick-tock of the wee hour shit started to get sour
She was killed by that fuckin' coward
How could nothin' take so much and
No more was uppin' no more huggin'
But his conciense know the truth so he fucked up and
Her memories was all that was left so to that I'm clutchin'
She was taken out of your reach now you can't touch her
Unfortunately also taken from us so we gotta suffer
Dabalin' down to that last supper gotta hustle
Feelin' my album shake the devil up reconstruct this motherfucka
I never slowed down just throw it down like I know how
Thought I do it like she would have wanted me to do it
I still can't believe I lost her in the worst way
She died wearin' my very first T-shirt on my birthday
Now what the fuck I'm supposed to celebrate
Would have celebrated if I caught his ass
But I got in my bed and it's too late
Everybody gotta roll they must play no hollerin' when to pray
But this mutherfucka gotta pay
There will be no reasonable excuse for what you've done
Even ignored him when he started stealin' from me
Cause them was crumbs
A raindrop to a river, huh, a sinner to a Christian
A holler to a whisper she was the sole reason
That I got along which, ya, but I'm a never
Heal from the scars of what you did to my sister

It's dark and hell is hot
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
'cause when its on, ya niggas gonna be gone
Every time 'cause we don't play
"Who turned out the lights?"
Is what niggas be sayin'
Now you don't wanna fight
But ya niggas be playin'
Thinkin' its alright keep playin with that road
And you gonna know the night
When you layin in that cold
Dirt gettin' tossed in your grave
Now it's all over
Preacher said "You was brave"
But now it's all over
You just one of the many, plenty I done gave it to
(*boom*) Ain't no savin 'you
No matter how many tears your moms' cried
Ain't gon bring your ass back
Plus in hell, you gon fry
Why? But now the only 2 releative questions
Is "Do we bury him or burn? Any suggestions?"
Either way, you up out of here for good
Now when niggas mention you name
They knockin' on wood
Did I, get my, point across?
Another body on the shotte
Another joint I toss
(Chorus)
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
'cause when its on, ya niggas gonna be gone
Every time 'cause we don't play (Repeat 4x)
There ain't no sunshine
When the Dark Man comes out
And I want mine
So I plan to keep my gun out
We got four 9's
So niggas run in and run out
But I bust mine
'cause I'd like to hear some shots
+Get At Me Dog+ niggas know how its goin dizzy
When it comes to that flow, I gets busy
Who is he? Dark Man of the unknown
(GRRR ARF) One dog, one bone
Now who ain't goin home? Looks like you
You hear strike 1, talkin' shit, strike 2
Won't be a strike 3, 'cause I don't play fair
I'ma look you in your eye
While he hit you from the rear
Be like "Yeah, holdin' you up 'cause you fallin'"
The Lord ain't comin' till niggas stop callin'
You was ballin' a minute ago
In it for dough
Till it was "Yo, I swear to God, I didn't know"
(Chorus)
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Whatchu think you gon get
Fuck around with my dough
Just so it ain't no mistakes, this is my show
One (one) two (two) three (three) here I go
Your shit is quick and your shit is sleek
But this shit is thick and when you hear this shit
Damn right I can finish shit
If you caught that verse without a rewind you can see mine
But you be blind, i'll do it 360, come up from behind
Tap you on the shoulder, have you turnin' around
Hit you with somethin' that i'll have you burin' the ground
Be like "Damn ain't nothin' left of money, but a pile of ash"
Life is good, so please enjoy it, while it lasts
'cause you know ain't got much longer to go
The quicker you go depends the stronger the flow
When niggas know I don't give a FUCK, right or wrong
There ain't no sunshine when it's on

(Chorus)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ay, take a good look at me - now picture me unhappy
No cash and outta fashion, not flashin'
Picture me doin' bad even if I wouldn't rappin'
Picture me even breathe on the mic not snappin'
I'm fire hot not lukewarm, my arms frozen
Picture me in a room full of hoes unchosen
Picture me with no P.O. and no 'dro
Picture pimps walk with some broads and ain't gettin' no 'tho
L.A. gone and I ain't gotta deal no mo' (Picture that)
A Ghet-O-Vision ain't real no mo' (Picture that)
A T.I.P. ain't worth a mill' no mo'
He still so-so (picture that) he still po'
***** picture that, or matter fact, picture T.I.P
Gettin' anything other than rich
Now can you picture this, young, pompous, arrogant son of a *****
Labelled as anything less than the ****, I can't see it

[Chorus: Beenie Man]
Dis bad man you get shot, anywhere
Bad man nuh tek back chat, no day
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat, zagga zow
Any bwoy flip dem ago flap - come again
Dis bad man you get shot, any day
Bad man nuh tek back chat, anywhere
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat - bak
Any bwoy flip dem ago

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Pull up in a blue coupe that's damn near clear
And Polo gear that won't drop 'til next year
Be like this here, Cartier frames and Piaget wristwear
T.I.P. your majesty's right c'here
Notice when I came the dames disappeared, ya lames listen here
To play me, ba-by, hey he
Gone need a track from God featuring Jesus or Jay-Z
Go on floss, ball but where it cost
Smile for the cameras, take your shirts off
Y'all ****** actin, take ya skirts off
Hoppin' Bob-ass ***** and he don't wanna work, boss
I'm gettin' sick and tired of these phony renditions
Wonder why I don't consider them no competition
There's no vision - little ambition
How I feel about these ******, am I worried? Are ya kiddin'?

[Chorus: Beenie Man]
Dis bad man you get shot, anywhere
Bad man nuh tek back chat, no day
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat, zagga zow
Any bwoy flip dem ago flap - come again
Dis bad man you get shot, any day
Bad man nuh tek back chat, anywhere
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat - bak
Any bwoy flip dem ago

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Some ***** wonder what my goal is
They think it's goin' gold havin' **** sweatin' me
**** that, I'm in it for the longevity
Picture me as one of the greatest that'll ever be
Comparin' me to 2Pac, B.I.G., and Jay-Z
Work with legends like, Organized No-I-Z, and J.D
Neptunes, they even flow on one of Dre's beats
Fly to Miami, chill with Luke and we can trade freaks
I freak shows, just peep **** under shade trees
Huh, but KP say just keep it top-notch
And make sure that the club is jumpin' like it's hopscotch
Floss rocks and in the summer keep the top dropped
Ten thousand dollars worth of clothes when I go shop
In the Impala on them Vogues so the **** jock
Especially when I rock that linen suit with no socks
In Polo skippers, they undo zippers
And they shows ****, the sure shot
I'm serious

[Chorus: Beenie Man]
Dis bad man you get shot, anywhere
Bad man nuh tek back chat, no day
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat, zagga zow
Any bwoy flip dem ago flap - come again
Dis bad man you get shot, any day
Bad man nuh tek back chat, anywhere
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat - bak
Any bwoy flip dem ago

[Outro: Beenie Man]
Well it's a Neptunes sound (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)

Take something simple like eating soup

She likes her crackers dissolved in the soup
(hehe) she's so cute
She light up my life, mayne
She does, believe her

[Verse 2:]
You told me
Keep your name off the press
So I gotta hold it in
Not say you the best
Yes, you're the opposite of stress
A whole lot more but you're damn showing nothing less
So tell me what's next
We headed to the crib just to have a little sex (make love)
Yes, there ain't no tests but your carats on your neck
Make your body feel timeless
It ain't nothing to it
Just like a door
Girl, you gotta walk through it, yeah
I'll show you I'm the truest
Girl To You, For Me

[Chorus:]
Won't you call this your love song
Not just a cut song
And I'm a lean to the side

[Verse 1]
Bricksquad ashless cocos, we get ashcriss
Say that that s your bitch but nigga we did action
Spent 10 Billion dollars of BBS s
Woke up in Texas, he text me, I start flexing
Diamonds chains sexy, my pistol is my best friend
I haven t killed in so many years, I get rusty
Hustling, my 40 keep budging in on the justice
These scary niggas calling the cops, but I ain t touched them
Finessed em, tricked them, leopards, that s on Simpson
Impress them, a victim, another lead hit successful
My weapon, F it, John W wanna happen
And since you said you looking for Gucci, I m on aggression

[Hook]
Don t trust me, I ll take some, I ll take some, I ll take some
Don t trust me, I ll take some, I ll take some, I ll take some
Don t trust him, he ll take some, he ll take some, we ll take some
Don t trust us, I ll take some, I ll take some, I ll take some

[Verse 2]
Work for couple mill, still I take some
24 hours, got the base running
Sale swag bad, I got freights coming
Say you swag pack, take it back from you
Them diamonds round your wrist, cause you a lot of problems
You scared to touch your ice, cause you don t want no problems
These young niggas out here hungry, they say it s no more starving
Finessing jewelry season, everybody robbing
Don t trust me, cause I m from the streets
Going drug shoppin, cop a couple of keys
I finesse the plug, when we don t agree
Dummy bank rolls, send em over seas

[Hook]
Don t trust me, I ll take some, I ll take some, I ll take some
Don t trust me, I ll take some, I ll take some, I ll take some
Don t trust him, he ll take some, he ll take some, we ll take some
Don t trust us, I ll take some, I ll take some, I ll take some

[Verse 3]
Ya ll niggas know how I move, y all niggas know what it do
Versace frames on my face, I m a 4 wided fool
If I should blue with your boo, pay mine to do on my coupe
A quarter brick for the booze, at least a 4 of them deuce
You know I shoot through my jacket, you call the troops for your truce
Full metal jacket a savage, I put 3 mill on your crew
The world grenade in the room, watch all your partners kaboom
I m a so icy tycoon, got 2 balloons in my troops
Is you gon hoe up or blow up? Is you gonn grow up or throw up
Cause I got dojos to roll up and I might pour us a 4
I can t drive a Corolla, roll around in a roller
That s a drop in Rolls Royce, y all niggas act like you know us

[Hook]
Don t trust me, I ll take some, I ll take some, I ll take some
Don t trust me, I ll take some, I ll take some, I ll take some
Don t trust him, he ll take some, he ll take some, we ll take some
Don t trust us, I ll take some, I ll take some, I ll take some
He could be a sinner, or a gentleman
He could be your preacher, when your soul is down
He could be your lawyer on a witness stand but
He'll never love you like I can, can
He could be a stranger, given the circumstance
He could be a trophy, of a one night stand
He could have your humour, I don't understand but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
Why are you looking down only one road
Mine is the heart, the soul for your soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can
A chance encounter of circumstance
Baby he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
He could be a silence in this mayhem, but then again
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
Why are you looking down only one road
Mine is the heart, the soul for your soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
We both have demons, that we can't stand
I love your demons, like devils can
If you're still seeking an honest man
I'm self deceiving but please
Why are you looking down only one road
Mine is the heart, the soul for your soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
Why are you looking down only one road
Mine is the heart, the soul for your soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
(Never x3)
You lift my heart up
When the rest of me is down (never)
You, you enchant me

If you run up, you'll get knocked the fuck out
Pound for pound, blow for blow, we can go into the ring, ass whoopin'
Here I go, here I go, here I go
Da man right chea
There's total silence, blood everywhere
And confusion on their faces as they continue to stare
Then Gwen starts shakin' and cryin', screamin', "What did you do?!"
And then the policeman looks at me and screams
"See, now I warned you!"
Then he starts pacing the floor screamin'
"God, what have we done here?!"
And she rushed to the door, blood on her hands screamin'
"There goes your whole career"
Meanwhile, I'm freakin' out sayin', "We gotta do somethin'
And gotta do somethin' quick"
Then he picks up the gun and says, "I have a wife at home
I can't have no cause of this"
She says, "James, I can't believe you just said what you said
'Cause that's not what you was sayin' when your ass was in my bed"
Then I said, "Get married later, but right now we gotta use our heads
First of all, did anybody think to check if the man was alive or dead?"
Then he looks at her, she looks at me
I look at them and we look at him
Meanwhile, Gwen's about to have a nervous breakdown
The way she's shakin' and cryin'
And then she screams, "You bastards! You've killed my brother!"
And then I said, "Gwen, wait a minute, I didn't"
She says, "No, you killed my brother!"
She said, "He just got out of prison, he's been through a lot
He was talking about changin' his life and everything
And to come home and get shot"
And I said, "Baby, it wasn't my fault, this man had a gun on me
And besides, how was I to know that you was getting down
With this crooked ass policeman?"
And he says, "Wait a minute," I say, "No, you wait a minute!"
And then I say, "Man, this is my wife
We had a life until you butted up in it!"
She cried out, "Sylvester, now hold on! Even though he was in our home Let's not forget the fact that you was out there
Creepin' in another man's home"
Twan starts coughin'
And she says, "Twan! Oh my god! Baby brother, are you okay?"
He looks up at her and says, "I'm not gonna die, at least not today"
And then he asks what happened, and says, "Why did I get shot?
Sylvester what is this policeman doin' here?"
And I said, "Go on, tell him cop"
He says, "Son, we gotta get you to a hospital
And take a look at that wound"
Twan says, "No, I'm okay, it's just my shoulder
All I need is a bathroom"
Now five minutes has gone by and they tellin'
Twan everything that happened
Twan says, "Fuck man, I would've been better off in prison"
And now somebody's banging at the door and I'm like
"Aw no! Here we go again!"
Thinkin' out loud to myself, sayin', "When is this shit gonna end?!"
Then Gwendolyn looks at me and says, "Baby, you got that?"
And I say, "No!"
She says, "Why?" And I said, "Because I'm not
Openin' up another motherfuckin' door!"
And the cop says, "Gwen, I'll get it"
Then looks at me and says, "Man of the house, my ass!"
Then I say, "I'll get it, but whoever it is
I'm about to put their ass on blast!"
And then the policeman grabbed me
I snatched away and got my gun up off the floor
Then Twan says, "Man, that's what I'm talkin' about!
Sylvester, point that shit toward the door!"
Then he snatches the policeman's gun and says
"Officer, arrest me later"
I count to three, Twan opened the door and it's
Rosy the nosy neighbor
Ooh, with a spatula in her hand
Like that's gon' do something against them guns
It's Rosy the nosy neighbor

Darling, I'll understand and I'll step aside
I won't stand in your way if you're not satisfied (Satisfied, ooh)

[Verse 2]
Follow, follow your heart
You know what's best for you (You know what's best for you)
And I love you much, too much

[?] with my soul

[Verse 2]
Now I sit here on my own
Lookin' at the sky and die

We'll know there is reason, yeah!

[Bridge]
Save me! Save me!

[Hook]
In the darkest days, the rain that falls
Hear me from the life that calls
And all the things I need to find an answer for
But in the end I know I'll see
The truth in all that I believe
I do what I gotta do
Cause I know that this, is where I wanna be

[Verse 1: DMX]
Got a lot to say, but don't know who to talk to
Step with a purpose, but don't know where to walk to
Anything I ever said, ever meant something?
I know, because the person I said it to, told me it meant something
My life has a meaning,my life has a purpose
No matter how dark it gets, I knew that it was worth it
Fuck what it looked like on the surface
Seen it all ,but not all heard us, like sometimes i was worthless
Can't expect everybody to get what you doing
Can't expect them all to be with what you doing
Don't give a fuck if a motherfucker hating
What you think it is with me ,but whats good with you lately
I hate when i sense this shit
Trying to make sense of this shit knowing that its sensitive shit
Niggas so dumb, that they don't even sense the shit
You said the shit, so I know you meant the shit you said

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Stan]
Born with addiction with fast living with high stakes
I race down a highway of life with no breaks
Make no apologies for the risks that I take
And manning up to the repercussions that I face
No silver spoon, I was raised in a crowded room
Rarely seen the sun, faced a lot of gloom
I hit the streets too soon before 21
Working on the clock since and on it until I'm done
I'm never clocking out, but always locking in
I had a warm heart, lost a lot of friends
And losing them make me feel like I was drowning
So please forgive the chill when you around me
Dreamed of living right, big family, the picket fence
Grandkids I will get to share my story with
But here I am, living vile as I stand my ground
Just hope it doesn't end, with shots fired, man down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: DMX]
If i could bottle the inspiration
Id be a billionaire,straight fuckin villian yeah
X baby you still in there
I feel the air, i can smell the death in it
Yall be leftin? it so fuck nigga step with it
The walk is easy, the journey ain't worth nothing
That's why every day a nigga wanna hurt something
But, I made progress, more or less
If I can avoid the stress, I can avoid the rest
A nigga stay dealing with the bullshit daily
Niggas is worse than the bitches, y'all hear me?
Straight up and fed up(what!)
I'll have you sprayed up and wet up(what!)
Now you laid up and won't get up
Now look at what the fuck you got yourself into
All i did was open the curtains and you jumped out the window
That's what suckers do
You just a punk motherfucker you
Got a nigga like motherfucker OOH!

[Hook]
I buyed me a little dog, color it was brown
I learned him to whistle, sing and dance and run
His legs they were fourteen yards long, his ears they were quite broad
Around the world in half a day and on him I could ride
Sing taddle o day

I buyed me a little bull about four inches high
Everybody feared him that ever heard him cry
When he begins to bellow it made such melodious sound
Till all the walls in London came tumbling to the ground
Sing taddle o day

I buyed me a flock of sheep, I thought they were all wethers
Sometimes they yielded wool, sometimes they yielded feathers
I think mine are the very best sheep for yielding me increase
For every full and change of the moon they bring both lambs and geese
Sing taddle o day

I buyed me a little box about four acres square
I filled it full of guineas and silver so fair
Oh now I'm bound for Turkey, I'll travel like an ox
In my breeches pocket, I'll carry my little box
Sing taddle o day
I buyed me a little hen, all speckled gay and fair
I sat her on an oyster shell, she hatched me out a hare
The hare it sprang a handsome horse full fifteen hands high
And him that tells a bigger tale would have to tell a lie
Sing taddle o day
Only you can hear my soul serenade
I want to be free to fly away and sing to the world
About my soul serenade, my soul serenade
When you're not around there's a lonely sound
In my soul serenade, in my soul serenade
Everyone but you adores me
But do you know pretty soon they bore me
Let me tell you right now that they bore me
They bore me with their pretty little words
Those pretty little words of devotion
But oh, let me tell you right now
My message to 'em this evening
Is they can jump in anybody's ocean
Because only you hear my soul
My soul serenade, my soul serenade
Oh, my soul serenade, my soul serenade
I walk on decrepit bricks and kick sticks and rusty soda cans
Simply for lack of better stimulation
Motivation comes and goes like gas station patrons
So sedation compensates for unexpected vacations
That's my pre-gratitude
Post, please leave me alone, that's just my rude attitude
No dysfunction flip side, I'm just your ordinary citizen
They're waiting patiently for me to sin again but then again
I'm really mommy's little angel
But that angel on my shoulder got strangled
For trying to tangle with his nemesis, he caught him on the wrong day
And got cut like DJs spinning doubles
I'm on my way to the store ignoring the city
To purchase a pack of Marb' Reds with a stack of rolled pennies
I could go for Denny's and my stomach holds plenty
But my pocket's got holes, I guess the goal is to stay empty
Quite simply put me and my pockets share interest
I'll never fall in love with that pretty green-eyed temptress twice
I learned my lesson the first time
I just couldn't keep up with that ever-changing Jordan line of foot apparel
Parallel to many clones, my eye's vision monochromes
With seven shades and twenty tones, plus I breath artistic
They eating everything I'm feeding them
Put myself in every painting and use my spit as mat medium
And results are my children, we share the same genes
Cast the same reflections and interpret the same dreams
Like whoa, like whoa, like whoa, like whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose
Feeling like I'm worthless
But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
Content with the fact that I know this city's mine
And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose
Feeling like I'm worthless
But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
Content with the fact that I know this city's mine
I walk down dead end streets like I didn't see the sign
Just to turn around and walk back, that's fine and dandy
But what's whack is the fact, I'm still walking
Like, "Thank God for Walkmans"
I'm only yawning 'cause these simple minded mortals make me sleepy
So what do I do? I resort to T.V
In the seemingly lousy attempt to numb myself with lackluster images
And insignificant information like, "Willis was really Todd Bridges"
Just to have the upper hand in monotonous conversations
And for lack of better stimulation
I'm painting portraits of dysfunctional families with gloomy faces
Rockin' "Don't Worry, Be Happy" T-shirts
And you're assuming I'm tasteless
You misconstrue it but your babies will embrace it
The basic essentials of a very bitter young man
That kicks rusty soda cans and walks on decrepit bricks
With a permanent pair of headphones
Trying to make these lectures stick
I'll let them protesters picket like they are gonna make a difference
And watch them die before they realize
That their cause was nonexistent
Like their cause was nonexistent
And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose
Feeling like I'm worthless
But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
Content with the fact that I know this city's mine
And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose
Feeling like I'm worthless
But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
Content with the fact that I know this city's mine
I walk on shitty city sidewalks stepping on every single crack
Reminiscent of that joke we used to say when we were snotty nose
My purpose got defeated when my mind turned paraplegic
Plus I failed my Civil Service exam, they said I cheated
Not to mention tainted urine samples
And the attention span of a second-grader
More fascinated with building blocks than wasting time
Stressing his daily lesson, hence the ritalin
I've been gone with the wind like lucky lottery tickets since day one
And stepped on the left 'cause right's wrong
So what do I do? I resort to friendly games of ping pong
And sing a song in "Sixpence", I'm "None the Richer"
I just kiss her on the lips and keep trucking
And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose
Feeling like I'm worthless
But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
Content with the fact that I know this city's mine
And at night, I roam these streets with absolutely no purpose
Feeling like I'm worthless
But contrary to my last statement, I feel fine
Content with the fact that I know this city's mine

Mama help i fell in love with a young girl

(you're the only girl i love to)
My heart was soakin and got broken in a young world
(so true, so true, listen)
I wasn't tryin to lead her on

But when she smiles she brought me home
So i brought her home

Young girl, so in love with you
The single girls are out tonight
But you have one word, my heart, one life
And i'm not lookin around
So why you lookin down
(what you lookin down for?)
I fucked up a long time ago
See i should have never let you know
See i couldn't give a fuck what tabloids say
(as the people magazine)
And crushes hurt both ways
What on earth, what i'm suppose to do
What on earth, what i'm suppose to do

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted, I bought them for you
Graceless lady, you know who I am
You know I can't let you slide through my hands

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Alicia Keys]
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away, oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
I watched you suffer a dull aching pain
Now you decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Adam Levine]
Baby, wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Adam Levine & Alicia Keys]
I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie, oh
I have my freedom, but I don't have much time
Faith has been broken, tears have been cried
Let's do some living before we die

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Adam Levine]
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild horses, we will ride them some day, yeah

Ooh Lord, you so freaky
Mmm uh, you so freaky shorty

Now everybody that's grown got skeleton bones
They got hidden away
Yes y'all there's a freak in us all
Yet some choose not to say

You can't let those who ain't yet
Make you they lil' ball of clay
Be free and express yourself
Nastiness comes naturally
Listen to me now

It could be the way I wanna freak a song
Tattoos, or the way I dress
Or it could be, I wanna walk my way
And refusin' to follow the rest
Or when people haven't been where you been
And they say you still going too far
Or when you wit ya girl and
Pull over and fuck somethin' in the back of the car

I'm a freak
(I'm so excited, go on and say it)
A closet freak
(Oh, I'm a freak, yes I'm a freak, and just can't fight it)
A freak
(I'm so excited, go on and say it)
Aww, a freak
(If you a freak, say you a freak, don't try to fight it)

You got to let the music freak your mind
All the way, if yo' brain leavin' don't mind
You know a boyfriend thing is hard to find
Get on the floor mama and bump and grind

Ain't nuttin' wrong wit, you only gon' get
But it ain't no fun if you been freakin' all mornin'
I'll turn you on to it if you want you gon' do it
All you got to do is find somebody like you

A freak
(I'm so excited, go on and say it)
A closet freak
(Oh, I'm a freak, yes I'm a freak, and just can't hide it)
A freak
(I'm so excited, go on and say it)
Aww, a freak
(If you a freak, say you a freak)
(Wait a minute, where the god-damn horns?)
Freak, sometimes I like freakin in the mornin'
Freak, sometimes I like freakin at night
Freak, some people like freakin just lightly
Freak, some people think freakin ain't right

Freak, some people like freakin outside now
Freak, some people like freakin in the club
Freak, some people like freakin on the express-way
Freak, some people keen doin' it in public

Freak, some people like freakin with the lights out
Freak, some people hell just don't care
Freak, some people like freakin 'bout money
Freak, some people freak anywhere

Freak, you a freak?
Freak, are you a freak?
Freak, I'm a freak
Freak, big ol' freak

Or gaze at Mona Lisa with someon

LIke Rio De Janiero

No need to spend my birthday
With all of my friends in New York City (boring)
No need to have floor seats
Seven game Celtics and Kobe (boring)
You make me say glory hallelujah
You're never boring (never boring)
Girl, you know, you make me say
Glory, hallelujah
You're never boring (never boring)
Girl, you know, you make me say
Glory, hallelujah
Make me say glory
There's no need to go
To Victoria's Secret show
Or stay in Saint-Tropez
On Jay and Beyonce's boat
No supermodel or Obama could interest me more
It's like everything's meaningless without you close
You make me say glory hallelujah
You're never boring (never boring)
Girl, you know, you make me say
Glory, hallelujah
You're never boring (never boring)
Girl, you know, you're driving me crazy

In the drug game the doppest ****a
We play for keefs, we lay in sheets

(Verse)
Antecinin' it be endecin' it every time
That's why I got hard on every rhyme
Hard, ****a, that's why I thank God for every line
No more invest, you demolish things while I'm barely tryin' (?)
Hard ****, bitches all on my dick, they hangin' on my Calvin Klein
I'm an outkast and I got 3000 big boys with me, ****a
Sit down and get war with me, I'm droppin' bombs out local Baghdad
And a bitch bound to get more from me
She Bread Murphy gettin' horse from me(?)
Bitches smoked weed with a gat man but neva got high
Took 10/000 feet in the sky, in an aircraft
Trappin' money, they come outta trap bad
I'm a dope boy, I sell cocaine you neva had dealt
I'm a whole brick and you a drop band
I'm a scientist and you a lab rat
Now show me where the craft at (money, ****a)
I need real cheese, I'm a fresh prince, you gotta feel me
I keep a Smith & Wesson I will squeeze
But I got Reggie Miller shooters I ain't gotta take the shot
Shamal Kensley, I'm sharp percentage when I move the white
Even said to Reggie to make mills week, ****a
(Hook x2)
Money on my mind, on my waist be that strap
Here to **** my grind, ****a, you dyin' in that stat

(Verse 2: Troy Ave)
Troy Ave ****a, in my blue bag, ****a
35 for the kilos, get mine at the? ****a
Pump my chips every flipper, fish scale, Mr. Flipper
Wait a minute, Floodina, I'm in the kitchen with ripper
Stuttering, goin' dummy, no other doors but the money
Get it sweeter than honey, you know how T roll ya dummy
Mobbin' deep cuz you nervous, it just be me during murders
Captain Loaf from survullance, I mean surveillance, we service
Cash business, you know, family, religion ain't dope
Ain't got my momma in snow, they made me the man and you know
I talk that **** when I flow, and it be facts
Only ****as from my blackboard, to big body bags of crack
Don't play me for no sucka, ****a, you can't afford that raffa (I know)
I made up from the dirt, made 6 figures, now I want 7
Millions, still keep me a million
I go stupider and get silly on em
Real ****a 4 real yellin' free Rum Pete on a pimp home
(Hook x2)
Money on my mind, on my waist be that strap
Here to **** my grind, ****a, you dyin' in that stat
No joke ****as, I'm self made, I'm a dope dealer
In the drug game the doppest ****a

(Verse 4)

Gettin' high with a brand new bitch in a brand new car
Gettin' the same ol' brain
I'mma zone where A-Town thank yeah ****a
This here ****a ain't no game
Hey, I'mma trap till the finish
Remember me? I was standin' on the corner, I was 'posed to be in school

In the Bentley with a couple hunnid mill, ride around with me

[VERSE 1]
Its 11:45
Gang of Escalades parked outside
Big bladess chromed up with shine
Only one thing on my mind
All week I've been a slave to the grind
Tonight I'm tryin' to have a good time
Rollin' wiht my whole crew behind me
To the livest hot spot we find
Haters step out my way
'Cause a playa just wanna play
No occasion to celebrate
But I'm gon' do it anywat
Line outside but I don't wait
Roll through the door but I don't pay
Lettin' go man I just can't wait
No more further delay
Time to get it on my people

[Chorus]
Ain't a thang wrong with having a good time
Ain't a thang wrong eith getting it on tonight
Woo, woo, wwo fel alright
Leave the bullshit way behind
'Cause its party time

[VERSE 2]
Making my way inside
See a honey by the bar that looks tight
Told her to order anything she likes
'Causeshe looks just that nice, yeah
After two drinks or more
I took her hand and moved to the floor
I handle mine, baby handle yours
'Cause I'm a make it hot for sure
Time to get it on my people

[Chorus 2X]

[Rap]

[BRIDGE]
I wanna see you dancing on the floor
Hands in the air like you don't care no more
Because tonighr we're gon' all out fa sho
Nothin' else on my mind
You know it party time, party time

[Featuring: 2 Chainz, Louie V]

[Intro:]
We just too turnt up
Turn up to the max
We be gettin to it
Do it straight like that

[Hook: x2]
We do it str8 like that, get money str8 like that
We run it str8 like that, who want it str8 like that?

[Bridge: x2]
We just too turnt up
Turn up to the max
We be gettin to it
Do it straight like that

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
DJ turn me up! Please don't turn me down
These niggas ain't hear me then, these niggas gonna hear me now
I got bad hoes in my section, these niggas wanna burn me down
So I'm gon' make it sparkle, tell the waiter come serve me now
Just Ciroc bottles and top models, all real niggas that pop bottles
I pulled up and I drop-topped, and my bad bitch just popped out
And like Alakazam! This shit way out of my hands!
And I'm with black card shawty, vroom-vroom jumpin out of that Lamb
Well damn, it's YSL in my shirt, fly as hell off Earth
Y'all niggas smoking on dirt, I'm on probation poppin on Perc
We sippin that lean, the fuck y'all mean
My money so long and my bitch so mean
We smokin on strong and I'm with my team
And We turned up, got your bitch tryna fuck

[Hook x2]

[Bridge x2]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
All I do is turn up, I'm about to show y'all
Early bird get the worm, I'm up way before y'all
I don't even know y'all, riding with the doors off
Fuck her on the lean, then I fucking doze off!
The dope man is my role model, I had a TV on top of my floor model
That bitch would show, fiends used to smoke dope out the antenna
Closet full of amphibians, aim at it and hit it
Difference between me and your girl: my girl, ass thicker
Life sentence my trunk, real niggas respect it
Dumb charm on my necklace, stupid watch on my left wrist
I ain't have a lot so I brag a lot, when I got a lot, I pop a lot
I bought a drop, bought some pussy, get head in the parking lot
My rhyme style's unorthodox, my weed stank no Tic-Tac
Asking me where I get that, Gucci sat on my flip flap!
Paint job cost 10 stacks, rims cost me another ten
So tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend

[Hook x2]

[Bridge x2]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Straight like that nigga, straight like that
No birthday get cake like that
And I ball hard niggas hate like that
Cause I drop that work, come straight right back like whoa
I peeled off in the Bent, came straight right back in a Rolls
Peeled off with ya bitch, came straight right back with y'all
Nigga we share that bitch, 10 big chains I don't wear that shit
Big Glock 9, I air that shit
And a big V12, I steer that shit like skurrrt
And they be like word, I'm with a bad bitch, but I wouldn't wife her
My neck all froze and my wrist like burr
And my shit so cold, I'm a need a light fur
We turned up to the max, turned up on them racks
Got shorty all on that pole and she gon turn up for these stacks
Cause I'm ballin, like Spalding
My wrist flooded, New Orleans
And I'm shittin on 'em, no toilet
And no referee, I called it

[Hook x2]

[Bridge x2]
What good is the dawn
That grows into day
The sunset at night
Or living this way

For I have the warmth of the sun
(Warmth of the sun)
Within me at night
(Within me at night)

The love of my life
She left me one day
I cried when she said
"I don't feel the same way"

Still I have the warmth of the sun
(Warmth of the sun)
Within me tonight
(Within me tonight)

I'll dreams of her arms
And though they're not real
Just like she's still there
The way that I feel
My love's like the warmth of the sun
(Warmth of the sun)
It won't ever die
(It won't ever die)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm feeling good tonight
Finally doing me and it feels so right, oh
Time to do the things I like
Going to the club, everything's alright, oh
No one to answer to
No one that's gon' argue, no
And since I got the hold off me
I'm living life now that I'm free, yeah
Yeah, I'm feeling good tonight...

[Break]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm feeling good tonight
Finally doing me and it feels so right, oh
Time to do the things I like
Going to the club, everything's alright, oh
No one to answer to
No one that's gon' argue, no
And since I got the hold off me
I'm living life now that I'm free, yeah
Yeah, I'm feeling good tonight...

[Break]

[Intro: T.I. Nitti]
This a Nitti beat!
Yo, yo
Hey Nitti
(Here we go, here we go)
What's up?
Nigga, you've been tryin' to get with T.I. or what not, but
(To the floor, there you go)
OK
You ain't came to fuck with a real nigga 

[?] you know what I'm sayin'?
(Here we go, here we go)
All right, so what's up?
I'ma show you what this Bankhead shit 'bout!
(To the floor, there you go)
Ay!
(Here we go, here we go)
T.I.P., nigga!
(To the floor, there you go)
Fuck this nigga T.I., you know what I'm sayin'?
(Here we go, here we go)
Real niggas on deck, you better act like 

[?]
It's T.I.P. man
(To the floor, there you go)
Let's get it!

[Verse 1]
I got a real '66 and a real thick bitch
Right beside me, showin' she can suck a real big dick
Hey, I'm a real cool dude with a real sick click
Come around me, cut the fool and you will get hit
Think we ain't totin' 2's? Well, you will get tricked
Tell 'em what you gonna do when we pull out and let 'er rip
What it is? I can run up on you at the crib
Get your bitch up out the room and the baby out the crib
Nigga, chill! I'm T.I.P., dude, keep it real
Who your favorite rapper was before he got a record deal
I suggest you stop your coppin'; where I'm from, it gets you killed
Omegas come through with the choppers, spray your block for 

[?]
Then detonate the bomb, hop in the Cadillac and peel
Homicide and CSI hit the scene, they like "Eww!"
While we hollerin' "Bankhead!" and "Rest in peace, Big Phil!"
And bust in bitches' mouths 'til their cheeks get filled

[Chorus:]
(Where them real niggas at?) Here we go, here we go
Bend it over, baby, drop it to the floor, there you go
(I'm sayin, where them real niggas at?) Here we go, here we go
Bust it open, show me you can get low, now you know
(Where them real niggas at?) Here we go, here we go
Bend it over, baby, drop it to the floor, there you go
(I'm sayin, where them real niggas at?) Here we go, here we go
Bust it open, show me you can get low, now you know

[Verse 2]
(Where them real niggas at?) On deck, don't stress
Tell them hoes go and flex, but nigga, who you gon' text
Nigga, make a lil' somethin' like I'ma make her somethin' next
Nah, hit 'em in the jaw, when I see 'em, that's that!
Drop Beamer bow-legged and my pockets stay fat
Crown cocked to the left but you call it an A hat
I ain't givin' my opinion, what I spit is straight facts
Even if you hear me say that these niggas is straight wack
Yeah, T.I.P., get it right, keep it straight, nigga
Key by the three, still serve plenty weight, nigga
The A's yay dealer done made it to eight figgas
In the club, love bitches but hate to take pictures
My patience real short for suckas and fake niggas
Ay, you better step aside unless you wanna lay with 'em
Since my partner died, I ain't got time to play with 'em
But bitches runnin' out the club like "Did you see how they did 'em?"

[Chorus:]
(Where them real niggas at?) Here we go, here we go
Bend it over, baby, drop it to the floor, there you go
(I'm sayin, where them real niggas at?) Here we go, here we go
Bust it open, show me you can get low, now you know
(Where them real niggas at?) Here we go, here we go
Bend it over, baby, drop it to the floor, there you go
(I'm sayin, where them real niggas at?) Here we go, here we go
Bust it open, show me you can get low, now you know

[Outro]
(Where them real niggas at?) Here we go, here we go
To the floor, there you go
(Oo, Where them real niggas at?) Here we go, here we go
Drop it to the floor, there you go
(I'm sayin, where them real niggas at?) Here we go, here we go
Drop it to the floor, there you go
(Where them real niggas at?) Here we go, here we go
And drop it to the floor
(I'm sayin, where them real niggas at?)

Baby, your fire burn just for me
Fillin' your desire with what you need
There is no doubt in me
Baby, you're gone to blow my mind

[Chorus]
I'll be your king tonight
All that you need tonight
You give me reason why
We won't waste our time
(Oh, baby, I need you to believe us)
You're nobody to give up on
(Oh, baby, I need you to believe us)
You're nobody to give up on

[Verse 2]
Girl, there ain't a flaw on you I can see
I want you to put all your love up on me
Yeah, no room they know 

[?]
Every night it's paradise

[Chorus]
She's the girl you see
Walking down the street
Holding her head high
Unstoppable
She's confident
Got a laser eye
Swinging to her own beat
And an A+ smile
She's a winner
Ooo
She is where it's at
She's as loud as an owl
She can stop the whole crowd
She is Heaven lent
'Cause I know they want her back
She's a full time believer
She wakes up early everyday
Yeah 'cause she's a
Full time believer
And she can care less what you say
Yeah 'cause she's a
Full time believer
Don't you get in her way
She combs her hair
With her diamond eyes
Staring at herself
'Cause she looks so fly
She can't help but show it
She's got that glow
And you know it, and I know it, and they know it
She's the rarest flower
An astrological find
And when she stretches on by
She blows my mind
She don't need nobody
I only wish she was
All mine...
She's a full time believer
She wakes up early everyday
Yeah 'cause she's a
Full time believer
And she can care less what you say
Yeah 'cause she's a
Full time believer
Everyday...
She lays in bed
With a real hard book
'Bout a Chinese girl
And a chance she took
She defines all lines
Maybe wrote the law
Oh, her daddy would be proud
If he was still around
She turns the light off
And dreams of Kings and gold
Can't touch her soul
Or keep her under control
She's a leader to be
Something you're gonna see
She made me a
A full time believer
Now I get up early everyday
I'm trying to be a
A full time beliver
I'm hoping that for me you will pray
I want to be a
A full time believer
Everyday

[Ja Rule and DJ Khaled]
One's for the trouble
Two's for the show

[Jadakiss]
Yo the hammer and the muzzle came together
All I had did was hold on to the pieces untill the puzzle came together
Before it all got hyped
I was in the corridor
Apple before it got riped
So I ain't gotta act like
I'm on top of, or in front of them
If I ain't the best dog then I'm one of them
Listenn I'm a different kind of boss
I'm Cut from a different kind of cloth
These niggas is different kind of soft
Everybody know it all
Nobody follow a protocal
The money's only good until you blow it all
Stacking every cents
Guliani knocked John Gotti, What?
So now he's running for president
It's a shame what the game's became
But the truth is
There's really nobody to blame
But the music
Lets give it a minute
Wtih no wack gimmicks
Just hard beats and rhymes
Blow breath back in it

[Chorus - Jada and DJ khaled]
One's for the trouble
Two's for the show
Three's for the base and that limelight glow

Put em up high, lets ride because

[Fat Joe]
Mutha Fucka i'm the heart and sole of this
You claim king, but we in control of this
Name another rapper you see on the streets
Huggin the block at the height of a beef
Yellow tape and white sheets
Yea that's my back drop whenever I speak
I know alotta y'all would love to ice me
Make my head jerk like I'm doing the hyphy
But that'll never happen, get on some sick shit
Like fifteen in you, and one in your infant
Joe's the business, Ask about me
In the middle of the desert
And they still can drought me
You know Coka baby he stay on that new york shit
You see weezy coming down on that forklift
And money ain't a thing, unless he come off with
Then Ima have to hit em with these little bricks often

[Chorus - Fat Joe and DJ Khaled]

[Ja Rule]
New york, New York nigga never went no where
I just took off a couple of years
But Now I'm back on my day to day
Old school, Gucci frames like day to day
Who gone tell New york times up, Flava flav
Cuz as much as things change it remains the same
And you can gimme the city of God
And Mecca, the temple, the mas
An inspiration, the inception, The art..
Of Hip Hip was born
And the rap game was formed
From niggas dead broke, sell drugs, bear arms
Against all odds
And argue all day about who's a bigger star
Joe, Jada, or Ja
SO close but so far
So many there's no star
I can't belive Fifty Cent and NY fell off
And L.A. came back, and the south is running shit
Then one blood group, shit's all developing, NEW YORK

[Chorus - Ja Rule and DJ Khaled]
One's for the trouble
Two's for the show
Three's for the base and that limelight glow
I know, you thinking that this game is over
Oh no, the wait is over
New York is back
Lemme see your hands, wave em side to side
Put em up high, lets ride because
New York is back
Lemme see your hands, wave em side to side
Put em up high, lets ride because
New York is back

Yo what up, my nigga
You know I was in the hood
I just thought I'd stop by
Holler at you for a minute
Pour out a little liquor or something

[R.Kelly]
Nigga, we done been through a lot of shit together
From running these streets to being down for whatever
And now that you're gone I got a whole lot of shit to tell you
Things I should've said way back when we was younger
Remember when we used to roll hand in hand
And now I'm tripping on how I really miss you, man
And remember when you and me would say
We'd get up out this hood and everything would be okay
It's all good now (My nigga)
We out the hood now
We had the same ideas, but not the same careers
We shared the same old laugh, and now the same tears
You were my homie, my sconey, my Roni
My nigga and never placed no bitch before me
Man, I swear to God I love you for that shit
Why'd you have to get hit
Where was I, what time was it
You were supposed to get older with me
On stage, hands on shoulders with me
Copping them Range Rovers with me
Sitting on thangs and smoking trees
And if it wasn't for the will that God had made
I'd turn back the hands of time and take your place
Sitting here sipping on this Hennessy
Just thinking about how much you meant to me (My nigga)
Even when you're gone you will always be my nigga
When you went home I'm still missing you, my nigga
I'm feeling like the timing was wrong, my nigga
I know you're smiling down saying carry on, my nigga
Sometimes my nights can get long, my nigga
Sometimes I feel God did me wrong, my nigga
So I had to write a song, my nigga
Just to let you know that you're still my nigga

[Chorus]
I wish, I wish, I wish (Oh I)
I wish, I wish, I wish

[R.Kelly]
Little son is looking at me like, "Where is my daddy?"
And your 13-year old daughter is mad 'cause she understands
Promised your mama I'd take care of the family
But she's so hurt, she turns away my helping hands
Damn, I wish your ass was here, my nigga
To grow that gray beard and smoke that cigar, my nigga
And we would talk about you getting up out this game
And you would tell me how it keeps calling you name
(We used to ride-ride-ride)
Never afraid to (Die-die-die)
But sometimes we (Cry-cry-cry)
Asking the Lord (Why-why-why)
They're tearing down these projects
We were homies for like 20 thug years
Sat in church and cried the same thug tears
You remember when Vibe World Premier
How we used to share the same old gear
And remember when you and me would say
We'd get up out this hood and everything would be okay
(It's all good now) My nigga
We out the hood now
It's so easy for folks to say, "Rob, just live on"
When I'm dying every second that you're gone
Nevertheless I try my best to be strong
Hoping you said your prayers before you went on home
When we stood on these blocks and just shot the breeze
We'd slapbox dead in the middle of streets
And if a fight broke out, you would take up for me
You're all I have left of these ghetto memories

[Chorus]

[Boo]
Uh, uh, yo dog, I can't explain how I miss you
We stayed together, copping cane, poppin pistols
I miss you most
Putting the doo rag over your bean head
Even out the hood on the scene you brag (whoa)
Coming up off the fiends for bags
Running up out the cleaners, drag
You was the closest nigga I had
Look how we stayed aces
Hustled, made big faces
I wish we could trade places
Fuck giving you ice, I'd rather give you life
And the things that I had, I'd give you twice (Oh yeah)

[Gotti]
So what the deal, my nigga, I know you holding it down
If you could see me you would say I'm talking soft right now
But it's hard for me to say when I'ma see you again
And I know it's fucked up, I gotta talk through this pen
But you died for the love of the dough
The love of the block, 16 you was running the spot
Boy, your mama used to hate how we stood on the curb
Hanging with wild thug niggas, smoking the herb
I'm gonna keep pouring this liquor and that's my word
This here is for my niggas that be flipping them birds
Word up!

[R.Kelly]
Even though you know you will always be my nigga
(Whoa...whoa...oh...oh)
Even though you're gone you will also be my nigga
I'm feeling like the time when I'm high, my nigga
I'm feeling like the time
I'm strung out, saying "Radio, please don't take the nigga out
This song"
Let it play on, play on, play on, play on...
So I had to write this song, my nigga
Just to let you know that you're still my nigga
Mm damn this sound familiar
This sound real familiar

What remix is this (feelin' on yo booty)4x

Verse 1

And when it comes to thinkin' 'bout anything but my baby
I just don't have the time

You got me workin' workin' day and night
Take it over
How did I ever let you slip away
Never knowing I'd be singing this song some day
And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more
Ever since you closed the door
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine
Funny, funny how time goes by
And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye
Woah, why oh why oh why should one have to go on suffering
When every day I pray please come back to me
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you would be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine
And you had enough love for the both of us
But I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did
But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you would be mine, woah
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you'd still be mine
I'd never hurt you (If I could turn back)
Never do you wrong (If I could turn back)
And never leave your side (If I could turn back)
If I could turn back the hands
(If I could turn back)
If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall
(If I could turn back)
Then I'd come to realize how much I love you
Love you (If I could turn back the hands)
Love you (If I could turn back the hands)
Love you (If I could turn back the hands)
Hope they never end this song
This could take us all night long
I looked at the moon and I felt blue
Then I looked again and I saw you
Eyes like fire in the night
Bridges burning with their light
Now I'll have to spend the whole night through
And honey, yes, I¨m gonna spend it all on you
Love, look what you've done to me
Never thought I'd fall again so easily
Oh, love, you wouldn't lie to me
Leading me to feel this way
We might fade and turn to stone
Let's get crazy all alone
Take me up your stairs and through the door
Take me where we don't care anymore
Love, look what you've done to me
Leading me to feel this way
Hold me closer than you'd ever dare
Close your eyes and I'll be there
After all is said and done
After all you are the one
Never thought I'd fall again so easily
Oh, love, you wouldn't lie to me, would you?
Leading me to feel this way
Love, look what you've done to me
Never thought I'd fall again so easily
Oh, love, you wouldn't lie to me
Leading me to feel this way
To make my father proud
To make my mother smile
I need not conquere worlds, or fame
Not set, the pace for style

If I can follow through
On, what they gave me as my tools
I'll find a way to sail my course
Avoiding ships of fools

If I don't come up, number one
I'll stand not well apart
As one for numbered numbers
When knowing in my heart

I've done all to be done
To always do my best
By listening to me, myself
So he can do or else
(Of without compromise
Shall follow the feel of constant care)
In my eleven hour
I'll be a man the way
To face whatever falls my way
Prepared that are a shame
To just be called a part of God

For which I have been named
A man and a woman's youngest son
While growing, still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smile...
(Proud)

[Verse 1]
New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down
New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down

[pause]

Like a rat in a cage, pulling minimum wage
(That's very dramatic, Nancy)
New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down

[Verse 2]
New York, you're safer, but you're wasting my time
Our records all show you were filthy but fine
But the records all show when you opened the doors
To the cops who were bored once they'd run out of crime

[Verse 3]
New York, you're perfect, oh, please don't change a thing
Your mild billionaire mayor's now convinced he's a king
And all the boring collect, I mean no disrespect
In the neighborhood bars I'd once dreamt I would drink

[Verse 4]
New York, I love you, but you're freaking me out
New York, I love you, but you're freaking me out
Like a death in the hall that you hear through your wall
New York, I love you, but you're freaking me out

[Verse 5]
New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down
New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down
Like a death of the heart, Jesus, where do I start?
But you're still the one pool where I'd happily drown

[Chorus 1]
And, oh! Take me off your mailing list
For kids who think it still exists
Yes, for those who think it still exists
Maybe you're right and maybe I'm wrong
Maybe you're right and maybe you're wrong
Maybe you're right, maybe you're right
And just maybe you're wrong

[Chorus 2]
And, oh! Maybe mother told you true
And there'll always be somebody there for you
And you'll never be alone
But maybe she's wrong and maybe I'm right
And just maybe she's wrong
Maybe she's wrong and maybe I'm right
And if so, here's this song
New York, I love you
But you're bringing me down
New York, I love you
But you're bringing me down

[Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
There must be more to life than this
There must be more to life than this
How do we cope in a world without love
Mending all those broken hearts
And tending to those crying faces
There must be more to life than this
There must be more than meets the eye
Why should it be just a case of black or white
There must be more to life than this

[Verse 1: Freddie Mercury]
Why is this world so full of hate
People dying everywhere
And we destroy what we create
People dying for their human rights
But we just go on saying c'est la vie
So this is life?

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
There must be more to life than killing
A better way for us to survive
I live in hope for a world filled with love
And we can all just live in peace

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Both]
There must be more to life than this
There must be more to life than this
A living hope for a world filled with love
There must be more to life than this
There must be more to life, much more to life
There must be more to life, more to life than this
Everybody say yeah (yeah!)
Say yeah (yeah!)
Say yeah (yeah!)
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Just a little bit of sou-ou-ou-ou-oul
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Clap your hands just a little bit louder
Clap your hands just a little bit louder

I know yeah
Everybody had a good time
So if you want me to
If you want me to
I'm gonna swing the song, yeah
Just one more time when I come by
Just one more time when I come by
So be advised (?)
Come on
Goodbye goodbye
Goodbye goodbye
Goodbye goodbye goodbye
I'm gonna go, yeah
I'm gonna go, yeah
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts

For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know...
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 1]
Compliments to the chef, the baby lamb was perfect
Now I smoke the drugs that got me feelin’ like I’m surfin’
Dusk on the North Shore, hash on my person
Roll it to a snake then I wrap it like a turban
We in the jungle with the shaman
Tryna find these answers to these problems I’ve been ponderin’
Now these motherfuckers hollerin’ with their lips puckered like colagen
Sell me the world, and my kids, put them in colleges
But daddy get it by himself on the reg
Stuffed zucchini flowers, mix ricotta with the egg
Chopped parsley, soft flakes, Himalayan minds
Meditation time helps me penetrate the mind
December 2nd, ’83 I was created
My vision’s wider, the human being’s jaded
It’s just reality, dealt with on a daily basis
Big Body put the burner in these bitches faces

[Hook]
Oh, they’re selling dreams out here
In every corner store
Pawn ‘em on the streets, I feel
They’re selling me the world
But if it all goes up, it could all come down the same
So when I go where I go I remember where I came…
Remember where I came from

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink it
Two in the pink, two in the stink
Leather-coloured goulash, talks with Lou Dobbs, create some new jobs
In ’87 I saw my father in a blue Saab
Right seat sittin’, left hand shiftin’
You know that every team needs a Paxton and a Pippen
Bronson rappin’ like he on an acid tab trippin’
You changin’ with the moon with a Maxi Pad drippin’
High-five love – 5’5, plump
Sell the pussy ’til the shit look like a Ty Cobb glove
Bring me back the money then I dip to Arizona
Put my balls in your mouth, bubble tea, tapioca
Smoke shark, speakin’ in a Nordic slang
Baby blue eyes, important like an August rain
Clear water from the creek keep me nourished
Keep my head up, never discouraged, pussy bitch

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah… remember where I came from…
Remember where I came from…
Yeah… remember where I came from…
Remember where I came from…
I wake up lonely in the morning and it feels so good
Smokin' on some shit that you wish you could
Jealousy, envy, please don't feel bad
This weed iz mine, get your own bag
A sack full of OG under lock and key
None for the homies, this is all for me
I got a blunt lookin' like a jelly palm tree
Police roll by, I got nothin' on me
'Cause the smoke's already in the air
I'm loped up with two braids in my hair
All star with the khaki suit
I'mma fuck around and take it back to classy suite
On the East Side standin' on the DIP
Back then my only weed was E-Y-E
You so PYT and you're lookin' so fine
I'm sorry, baby-girl, but tonight
This weed iz mine
This weed iz mine
You can't have it
This weed iz mine
This weed iz mine
You can't have it
This weed iz mine
Get back to the episode, sacks full of honey
Out of this world, 

[Incomprehensible]
This is church music, listen to the choir
To burn my kush, you must use fire
D-O double G like never heard before
Smokin' that bomb like TAC-4
West Coast worldwide, sea shore to sea shore
When's the last time you seen the G in the G4
(What?)
Don't worry, I'll wait
Time's tickin', I'm trippin', I'm slippin', I'll wait
Into the zone where these whores on my dog bone
A dog whistle and they download my ring tone
And she's so hypnotized by this pimp's poem
What I got here is mine, go and get your own
I put beats to rhymes, get peace of mind
OZ's to dimes and this weed iz mine
This weed iz mine
This weed iz mine
You can't have it
This weed iz mine
This weed iz mine
You can't have it
This weed iz mine
I hear niggers talkin' 'bout what they rollin' up
Smell what I smoke 'fore the bag open up
Good chance if you see me down smokin' one
License to get a fundamental load of shit
Real nigga, blow a reefer, I is old enough
If I'm in a building, it's hard not to notice it
Hit a really sad dog, I got some whores to fuck
I'mma fall through with the ounce 

[Incomprehensible] shit
Don't trip, bitch, we go all set, load a whole zip
Let you hit mine, plus you supplyin' your own little bit
My nigga get high and let the whores twist
Say you don't fuck with 

[Incomprehensible] how you rolled it
They ain't smokin' like us
I'm rollin' up haters, they be burnin' for hours
And if it's found
I'm smokin' the whole thing inside
This weed iz mine
This weed iz mine
You can't have it
This weed iz mine
This weed iz mine
You can't have it
This weed iz mine
I got a roll for you, do you wanna smoke with me?
I wanna smoke with you, do you wanna smoke with me?
(I wanna smoke with you)
I got a roll for you, do you wanna smoke with me?
(I got a roll for you, if you wanna smoke)
I wanna smoke with you, do you, do you
(Oh yeah, do you?)
Do you wanna smoke with me?
(I said I wanna smoke with you)
Do you wanna smoke with me?
(I wanna smoke with you)
This weed iz mine
This weed

Every day there's something new
Honey, to keep me lovin' you
And with every passin' minute
Ah baby, so much joy wrapped up in it
Heaven must have sent you from above
Heaven must have sent your precious love
And I, I've got a song to sing
Tellin' the world about the joy you bring
And you gave me a reason for livin'
And ooh, you taught me, you taught me the meaning of givin'
Heaven must have sent you from above
Heaven must have sent your precious love
To find a love like ours is rare these days
'Cause you've shown me what happiness is in so many ways
I look in the mirror, and I'm glad to see
Laughter in the eyes where tears used to be
What you've given me I could never return
'Cause there's so much, girl, I have yet to learn
And I wanna show, I wanna show my appreciation
'Cause when I found you, I found a new inspiration
Heaven must have sent you from above
Heaven must have sent your precious love
Heaven must have sent you from above
Heaven must have sent your precious love
Oh she can wait for what I can give
She knows what I am but she won't believe me
Is it all ok?
Will I come off the lightest?
I can't believe, it's always like this

Kept it at bay
Yes you kept your word
It's there on your mouth but it's not what I heard
If I follow the light that I deem the brightest
I won't believe it, it's always like this

(No, no, no, no, no)
I'm not whole
I'm not whole
Oh you waste it all
I'm not whole
I'm not whole
Oh you waste it all
I'm not whole
I'm not whole
Oh you waste it all
I'm not whole
I'm not whole
Oh you waste it all
But I'm not whole
Oh you can wait for what I can give you
Know what I am see know how I live it
Try to look proud but you're not in the slightest
It's happening now and it's always been like this

I'm not whole
I'm not whole
Oh you waste it all
I'm not whole
I'm not whole
Oh you waste it all
I'm not whole
I'm not whole
Oh you waste it all
I'm not whole
I'm not whole
Oh you waste it all
I'm not whole
I'm not whole
Oh you waste it all
I'm not whole
I'm not whole
Oh you waste it all
I'm not whole
I'm not whole
Oh you waste it all
I'm not whole
I'm not whole
Oh you waste it all
But I'm not whole
Into the streets
We're coming down
We never sleep
Never get tired
So urban feels
And suburban lights
Turn the crowd up now
We'll never back down
Shoot down the skyline
And watch it on primetime
Turn up the love now
Listen up now, turn up the love

[Chorus]
Who's gonna save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring me back to life?
We're gonna make it, you and I
We're gonna save the world tonight
OHOHOHOHOOHOH
OHOHOHOHOOHOH
OHOHOHOHOOHOH
We're far from home, it's for the better
What we dream, it's all that matters
We're on our way, united
Turn the crowd up now
We'll never back down
Shoot down the skyline
And watch it on primetime
Turn up the love now
Listen up now, turn up the love

[Chorus]
Who's gonna save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring me back to life?
We're gonna make it, you and I
We're gonna save the world tonight
OHOHOHOHOOHOH
OHOHOHOHOOHOH
OHOHOHOHOOHOH
What's your hurry? Just watch this
This is one you mustn't miss:
Annie's going to sing her song
Called
"Take Me Back Again

A drink for me, a drink for you;
You're going to need a drink or two:
Annie's going to sing her song
Called
"Take Me Back Again

You never heard it sung before;
I hear it twice a month or more
Complete with tears and sheepish grins;
It only lacks the violins

The tune goes flat from time to time
The lyric sometimes fails to rhyme
But Annie's going to sing her song
Called
"Take Me Back Again
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Annie's going to sing her song
Called
"Take Me Back Again

It sometimes lasts the whole night long
Depends on how long she's been gone
I sit and look as hard as nails;
She knows the damn thing never fails

Take the bottle, fill your cup;
Don't miss the part where I fold up;
Annie's going to sing her song
Called
"Take Me Back Again

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Annie's going to sing her song
Called
"Take Me Back Again

It isn't Annie's only tune;
The other I'll be hearing soon
Next week, tomorrow, or today;
She sings it when she goes away
Take the bottle, fill your cup;
Don't miss the part where I fold up;
Annie's going to sing her song
Called
"Take Me Back Again;
Come on, Annie, sing you song
Called
"Take Me Back Again

Yeah, we're locked up in ideas
We like to label everything
Well, I'm just gonna do here what I gotta do here
'Cause I gotta keep myself free
You're ducking and moving just to hide your bruises
From all your enemies
And I'm in the crossfire dodging bullets
From your expectancies, yeah, yeah

Ooh, we got nothing to lose
You better run and hide, yeah, you crossed the line
I got a knife behind my back, just sayin'
Ooh, we got nothing to prove
Your social guides give you swollen eyes
But what I got can't be bought, so you can just

Call it what you want, eh, eh, eh
Call it what you want, eh, eh
Call it what you want, eh, eh, eh
Call it what you want
You've taken your words and you take your judgments
And stick 'em onto everything
If it don't conform to what you were born into
Then you run the other way
You say, "Now what's your style and who do you listen to?"
Who cares?
Well, that rat race ladder-climbing fake-face smile's
Got nothing on me, yeah, yeah

Ooh, we got nothing to lose
You better run and hide, yeah, you crossed the line
I got a knife behind my back, just sayin'
Ooh, we got nothing to prove
Your social guides give you swollen eyes
But what I got can't be bought, so you can just

Call it what you want, eh, eh, eh
Call it what you want, eh, eh
Call it what you want, eh, eh, eh
Call it what you want
Want, want, want, want

What you want, want, want
Call it what you want, want, want
You can call it what you want
Eh, eh, eh, call it what you want
You can call it, you can call it what you want
What you want, want, want
Call it what you, call it what you want
What you want, want, want
You can call it what you want
I've got a sweet little angel
I love the way, she spread her wings

Yes got a sweet little angel
I love the way she spread her wings

Yes when she spread her wings around me
I get joy in everything

You know I asked my baby for a nickel
And she gave me a twenty dollar bill

Oh yes I asked my baby for a nickel
And she gave me a twenty dollar bill

Well you know I asked her for a little drink of liquor
And she gave me a whiskey still

Oh if my baby quit me
Well I do believe, I would die
Oh if my baby quit me
Well I do believe, I would die

Yes if you don't love me little angel
Please tell me the reason why

Broke down, I found
Even when you think you need a rest
You will live to fight another round
I know its too bad, so sad
All the things that we could've been and could've had

Hey girl, what sound
A million miles of water that are flowing deep beneath this
Ground
Now, I found you right here
A million miles of water

You were my muse
Just because you happen to have a bomb doesn't mean you
Light the fuse
I know that my girl, big lie
Four years in and you never even said goodbye

Hey girl, what sound
A million miles of water that are Flowing deep beneath this
Ground
Now, I found you right here
A million miles of water dear
Hey girl, what sound
I want you to remember that some times we have to go without
Now I found it right here
I want you to remember dear

We were two of a funny kind
So damn blind but now we got to nevermind
I know that this is the end, we tried
So hard, but now I got to lose a friend

Hey girl, what sound
A million miles of water that are Flowing deep beneath this
Ground
Now, I found you right here
A million miles of water dear

Hey girl, what sound
I want you to remember that some times we have to go without
Now I found it right here
I want you to remember dear
Is it going, is it going, is it going, is it going?
I don't know what you're looking for

I'm the type of girl that'll look you dead in the eye, eye
I'm real as they comes if you don't know why I'm fly-y-y
Seen you try to switch it up but girl you ain't got to
I'm a wonder woman let me go get my ropes

I'm a supermodel and mummy, si, mummy
Amnesty international got bankrupt, I'm on top, on lock
You love my ass and my abs in the video called promiscuous
My style is meticulous-s-s

If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

When Timbo is in the party everybody put up their hands
I get a half a mil for my beats, you get a couple grand-d-d
Never gonna see the day that I ain't got the upper hand
I'm respected from California way down to Japan
I'm a real producer and you just the piano man
Your song gonna top the charts, I heard 'em, I'm not a
Fan-n-n
Talkin' greasy I'm the one that gave them they chance
Somebody need to tell 'em t-t-they can't do it like I can

If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

Could you speak up and stop the m-m-mumbling
I don't think you're getting clear
Sitting on the top it's hard to hear you from way up here
I saw you tryin' to act cute on TV just let me clear the air
We missed you on the charts last week

Damn, that's right, you wasn't there
If s-s-sexy never left, then why's everybody on my shit-t-t?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it
So, if you see us in the club go on and walk the other way
'Cuz our run will never be over, not at least until we say

If you see us in the club, we'll be acting real nice
If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night
We ain't here to hurt nobody
So, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
Wanna see you work your body
So, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

[Verse]
When I first saw you
I said "O My", I said "O My"
That's a dream
That's my dream
I needed a dream
When it all seemed to go bad
Then I found you
And I have had the most beautiful dreams any mans ever had

[Verse 2]
When I first saw you
I said "O My", "O My"
That's my dream
That's my dream
I needed a dream

To make me strong
You were the only reason I had to go on

[Chorus]
You were my dream
All the things I never knew
You were my dream
Who could believe they could ever come true
And who would believe
The world would believe
And my dreams too

[Verse 3]
When I first saw you
I said "O My", "O My"
That's my dream

[Fade Out]
(Bob Dylan)
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks
Preoccupied with his vengeance
Cursing the dead that can't answer him back
I'm sure that he has no intentions
Of looking your way, unless it's to say
That he needs you to test his inventions
Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to
He looks so truthful, is this how he feels
Trying to peel the moon and expose it
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
If he needs a third eye he just grows it
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk
Or pick it up after he throws it
Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to
Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Their religion of the little ten women
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised
Come on out the dark is beginning
Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to

[Verse 1]
Well Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
I'll show you the ropes kid, show you the ropes
There's a freak scene brewing in my house, my house
I'll show you the ropes kid, show you the ropes
I got a 

[?] playing in my house, my house
And all the furniture is in the garage
Well Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up

[Chorus]
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up

[Verse 2]
But Daft Punk is playing in my house, my house
I waited 7 years and 15 days
There's a bunch of kids queued up at my house, my house
And all the neighbors can't phone the police
There's a fist fight brewing' at my house, my house
Because the jocks can't get in the door
When Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up

[Chorus]
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up, ooh
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up
So solo Gavin

[Verse 3]
Got everybody's P.A. in my house, my house
And Sarah's girlfriend, she's working the door
There's a freak scene brewing in my house, my house
And all the robots descend from the bus
There's a freak out brewing in my house, my house
In the basement
'Cause Daft Punk is playing in my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up

[Chorus]
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up, ooh
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up

[Outro]
And never, never, never let them go
No never, never, never let them go
Never, never, never let them go
You let 'em go
Never, never, never let them go
Never, never, never let them go
Never, never, never let them go
Let 'em go
Downtown
Bang on my window if
You want to get your look out
I felt the wind blow when
She took her little book out

I'm steady loving on the
Lady of these pages
Another chapter if you will
So adventageous

Down on the river tonight
Take off your glasses and fight

Under the hula moon I'm
Going to pop the culture
Blue cherry dress on you
Is looking like a sculpture

This recreation is amusing
And confusing
You never knew that it
Could feel so good while losing
What you lose?
Your virginity

Down on the river tonight
Take off your glasses and fight

I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
Get so emotional
I got a notion for
And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliment
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow

My intuition was a
Poppin' and a shakin'
The very thought of it was
All too much to take in

Curl up with lover we
Could lie out on the blanket
This canopy above i'll
Take the time to thank it

Down on the river tonight
Take off your panties and fight
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
Get so emotional
I got a notion for
And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliment
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow

I want to bury my face
Deep in your aroma
Her name is Lisa
But they call her Desdemona

Come out and see me for
Some street comunication
I think it's sweet of you
To be my motivation

I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
Get so emotional
I got a notion for
And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliment
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow

[Verse 1]
I can't control this flesh and blood
That's wrapped around my bones
It moves beneath me, like a river
Into the great unknown
I stepped onto the moving stairs
Before I could tie my shoes
Pried a harp out the fingers of a renegade
Who lived and died the blues

[Pre-Chorus]
And his promise made was never clear
It just carved itself in me
All I saw was frost inside my head
On the night he said to me

[Chorus]
Someday, we'll live like horses
Free rein from your old, iron fences
There's more ways than one to regain your senses
Break out the stalls, and we'll live like horses

[Verse 2]
We're the victims of the heartbreak
That kept us short of breath
Trapped above these bloodless streets
Without a safety net
I stood in line to join the trial
One more customer of fate
Claimed a spoke in the wheel of a wagon train
On the road to the golden gate

[Pre-Chorus]
On the flat, dry desert, I jumped ship
It just made sense to me
I've spent too long in the belly of the beast
And now, I shall be free

[Chorus]
Someday, we'll live like horses
Free rein from your old, iron fences
There's more ways than one to regain your senses
Break out the stalls, and we'll live like horses someday

[Outro]
Free rein from your old, iron fences
There's more ways than one to regain your senses
Break out the stalls, and we'll live like horses
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know my love not fade away

You know my love not fade away
Not fade away

My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel

Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

Going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad, hey hey hey, yeah
Don't wanna be treated this-a way
Going where the climate suits my clothes
I'm going where the climate suits my clothes
Going where the climate suits my clothes
Don't wanna be treated this-a way

Going down the road feeling bad
Well I'm, going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad, hey hey hey, yeah
Don't wanna be treated this-a way

Going where the water tastes like wine
Well I'm, going where the water tastes like wine
Going where the water tastes like wine
I don't wanna be treated this-a way

Going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad, hey hey hey, yeah
Don't wanna be treated this-a way

Going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad, hey hey hey, yeah
Don't wanna be treated this-a way

Well I'm, going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad
Going down the road feeling bad, hey hey hey, yeah
Don't wanna be treated this-a way
You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart
I feel like this is the beginning
Though I've loved you for a million years
And if I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears, whoa oh oh ah
You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always stay around, mmm mmm yeah yeah
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart
You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue
And I know that this must be heaven
How could so much love be inside of you?
Whoa oh oh oh
You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
That's why I'll always stay around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart
You are the sunshine of my life, baby
That's why I'll always stay around
Yi-yi, yi-yi-yi, yi-yi

[Verse 1]
When you're on the top
There's no place you can really go but down, down, down
People on the street congratulate you
They say they love the way you sound

Where...when you're on the low
No one wants to chit or chat or even know your name
Your agent's never there
Your manager has ripped you off and gone somewhere
Standing on the top

[Chorus: The Temptations & Rick James]
Standing on the top...top
On the top getting down, yeah
Standing on the top (Yeah)...top
On the top getting down, Temptations sing

Standing on the top
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Standing on the top
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
When you're on the top
Everyone you meet they wanna be your long lost friend
They say how great you are, a superstar
But do you have any money to lend
(Hey, man, can you loan me a few bucks?)

When you're on the low
Where do all the freaks and fancy people go?
(I don't know) I don't know
People sit and stare
Asking crazy questions: "Do you braid your hair?" and "What's L-7 Square?"

[Chorus: The Temptations & Rick James]
Standing on the top...top
On the top getting down, yeah
Standing on the top...top
On the top getting down, down, down, down

[Bridge: Rick James + (The Temptations)]
(We understand it)
Can you understand it what I'm talkin' about
When I say that funk is here to stay
(We understand it)
Can you understand it what I'm talkin' about
The funk is here to stay, oh (We understand it)
If you understand it, say "Yeah" (Yeah... Yeah...)
(We understand it)
When I say that funk is here to stay
The funk is here to stay

[The Temptations]
We want the funk
(We want the funk and nothing else will do
Nothing else will do, no)

We want the funk
(Ooh, woo, woo, we want the funk, nothing but the funk, funk)

We want the funk
(Ooh...we want the funk and nothing but the funk)

We want the funk (We want the funk)
(All we're saying is we want the funk)

We want the funk
We want the funk and nothing else will do
(We want the funk)
We want the funk and nothing else will do

(We want the funk) We want the funk
We want the funk and nothing else will do
(We want the funk)
We want the funk and nothing else will do

(We want the funk) We want the funk
We want the funk and nothing else will do...
I Want You Back
When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you
Stand out in a crowd

Then someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me
To take a second look

Oh, baby, give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
(Back in your heart)
Oh, darling, I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms

I want you back
Yes, I do now (I want you back)
Ooh, ooh, baby (I want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (I want you back)
Now, now, now
The Love You Save
When we played tag in grade school
You wanted to be it
But chasin' boys was just a fad
You crossed your heart, you'd quit
When we grew up you traded
Your promise for my ring
Now just like back in grade school
You're doing the same old thing

Stop, the love you save maybe your own
Darlin' take it slow
Or some day you'll be all alone
(You better stop)
(The love you save maybe your own)
Darlin' look both ways before you cross me
You're heading for a danger zone

I'll Be There
You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love
I'll be there
(I'll be there)

I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there
(I'll be there)
I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'll be there
With a love that's strong
I'll be your strength
I'll keep holdin' on, ooh
(Holding on)

If you should ever find someone new
I know he'd better being good to you
'Cause if he doesn't
I'll be there (I'll be there)

Don't you know, baby, yeah, yeah
I'll be there
I'll be there
Just call my name and I'll be there
Just look over your shoulders, honey, ooh
I'll be there
I'll be there

Just call my name, and I'll be there
Johnny's in the basement
Mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement
Thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat
Badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off
Look out kid
It's somethin' you did
God knows when
But you're doing it again
You better duck down the alleyway
Lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coonskin cap,in the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills but you only got ten
Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put
Plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D.A. look out kid
Don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes
Don't try "No Doz"
Better stay away from those
That carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose
Watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weather man
To know which way the wind blows
Get sick, get well
Hang around a ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell
If anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred
Get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail
Join the army, if you fail
Look out kid
You're gonna get hit
But losers, cheaters
Six-time users
Hang around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool
Lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters
Ah get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance, learn to dance
Get dressed, get blessed
Try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
Twenty years of schoolin'
And they put you on the day shift
Look out kid
They keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole
Light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals
Try to avoid the scandals
Don't want to be a bum
You better chew gum
The pump don't work
'Cause the vandals took the handles

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Waterfall
Nothing can harm me at all
My worries seem so very small
With my waterfall

[Verse 2]
I can see
My rainbow calling me
Through the misty breeze
Of my waterfall

[Bridge]
Some people say
Daydreaming's for all the, huh
Lazy minded fools
With nothing else to do
So let them laugh, laugh at me
So just as long as I have you
To see me through
I have nothing to lose
Long as I have you

[Verse 3]
Waterfall
Don't ever change your ways
Fall with me for a million days
Oh, my waterfall

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Outside the cafe by the cracker factory
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude
As you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix

Said "You're mistaken if your thinking that I haven't been called 'cold' before"
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
Is all you have left and it was going to waste

[Bridge]

[Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called

[Chorus]
Crying Lightning
And how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons

[Verse 2]
The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on it's way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne

With folded arms you occupy the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you never lost a war
And though I try so not to suffer the indignity of reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

[Bridge 2]
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called

[Chorus]
Crying Lightning
And how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons

[Outro]
Uninviting
But not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are
Crying Lightning

[Verse 3]
Oh you were reading a book about some idiot and telling me about another
I was so severely underwhelmed I thought I might never recover

Straighten the rudder girl and sail me up stairs
And go and find somebody who cares
Well we might not be the perfect partners but tonight we make a pair

[Bridge 2]

Crying Lightning
Crying Lightning
Crying Lightning
Crying Lightning

[Bridge 2]

Crying

[Verse 1]
Feelin' so confused
You don't know what to do
Afraid she might not love you anymore
And though she says she does
And hasn't lost your trust
Who could that be knockin' at her door?

[Chorus]
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves

[Verse 2]
The feelin' never stops
And neither does the clock
Wishin' for tomorrow today
She still says she's true
So you start comin' to
Just as that old knockin' comes to stay

[Chorus]
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves

[Chorus]
(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I’m watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(With ribbons in knots)
Play 'em like guitars, only one of my toys
('Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I was sent to destroy, yeah

[Verse 1]
Pink flamingos
Always fascinated me
I know what only the girls know
Hoes with lies akin to me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I, I see you're going
So I play my music, watch you leave

[Chorus]
(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I’m watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(With ribbons in knots)
Play 'em like guitars, only one of my toys
('Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I was sent to destroy, yeah

[Verse 2]
Velveteen and living single
It never felt that right to me
I know what only the girls know
Lies can buy eternity

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I, I see you leaving
So I push record and watch you leave

[Chorus]
(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I’m watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(With ribbons in knots)
Play 'em like guitars, only one of my toys
('Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I was sent to destroy, yeah

[Bridge]
I live to love you
And I love to love you
And I live to love you, boy
I live to love you
And I love to love you
And I live to love you, boy
Nothing gold can stay
Like love or lemonade
Or sun or summer days
It's all a game to me anyway

[Chorus]
(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I’m watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(With ribbons in knots)
Play 'em like guitars, only one of my toys
('Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I was sent to destroy, yeah

[Outro]
Putting on my music while I’m watching the boys
Putting on my music while I’m watching the boys

[Verse 1: Johnny Cash]
For two long years my head hurt bad
So the doctor checked me and he shook his head
He said, "I'm sorry to tell you but your body's outlived your brain"
He said, "I know this doctor in New York son
And he'll fix you up right with a brand new one"
So the head doctor met me when I stepped down off the train
He said, "We had this bank robber killed last night
His body's shot but his brain's alright
I'll give you a transplant boy, and it'll be okay"
I got my new brain in and I was feeling great
I went right back to Nashville with no headache
But something strange happened when I walked in the bank one day

[Chorus]
I said "Stick 'em up everybody, I'm robbing this place
Drop all of your money in my guitar case
Don't nobody move and don't nobody reach for that door
A lady said, "Why, you're Johnny Cash!"
I said, "No ma'am, I'm the Manhattan Flash
And I am the best bank robber in New York"

[Verse 2]
Now the other night, Roy Acuff called me
He said, "John, I'd like for you to do the Opry"
So I went out on the stage, but I couldn't sing
I got into half a verse of "I Walk The Line"
And something snapped in that head of mine
I yelled, "Stick 'em up! Gimme your money, your watches, and rings"
Well I called New York and talked to that brain quack
I said, "Doc, I've got to have my old brain back"
He said, "I'm sorry there Mr. Cash, but I can't do that"
He said, "I put your brain in a chicken last Monday
He singing your songs and making lots of money
And I got him signed to a ten year recording contract"
Now friends, if you see me walking down the street
Remember what you see ain't necessarily me
And if I try to hold you up, don't pay me no mind
But when you got ten bucks that you can blow
You ought to catch that Johnny Chicken Show
He's doin' fairs and concert dates all up and down the line

[Chorus]
I said "Stick 'em up everybody, I'm robbing this place
Drop all of your money in my guitar case
Don't nobody move and don't nobody reach for that door
A lady said, "Why, you're Johnny Cash!"
I said, "No ma'am, I'm the Manhattan Flash
And I am the best bank robber in New York"

[Outro]
Well, I don't pay any income tax
You don't pay tax on money you steal
But you ought to catch that Johnny Chicken Show
Chicken In Black
Mm...

[Intro]
What are you lookin' at?
(Yeah)

[Verse 1]
I saw this coming from a mile away
I saw a crack in the egg
A little rip in the page
I found your knickers on the floor
Underneath the bed
Where you said
I was the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
You thought I'd cry (You thought I'd cry)
You thought I'd lay down and die
You thought there's no getting over you (Ha-ha)
And all this time (All this time)
You've been having your fun
I've been having some fun too

[Chorus]
'Cause it takes one to know one
Congrats you've met your match
You think I'd lie here, heartbroken
But the knife is in your back (In your back)

[Verse 2]
You left your suit, you left your tie
And looked me in the eye
And swore that it was business baby (Yeah, right)
And when you left I got a call
That started it all
And now it's not your business, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
You thought I'd cry (You thought I'd cry)
You thought I'd lay down and die
You thought there's no getting over you (Ha-ha)
But all this time (All this time)
You've been having your fun
I've been having some fun too

[Chorus]
'Cause it takes one to know one
Congrats you've met your match
You think I'd lie here, heartbroken
But the knife is in your back (In your back)

[Bridge]
You're such a wreck
The cutest accident
Makes so much sense
You'll come back to me, oh (Oh)
And I'll let you
Hey, huh, you're back

[Chorus]
'Cause it takes one to know one
Congrats you've met your match
You think I'd lie here, heartbroken (Heartbroken)
But the knife is in your back (In your back)

[Chorus]
'Cause it takes one to know one (Hi, nice to meet you)
Congrats you've met your match
You think I'd lie here, heartbroken (Heartbroken)
But the knife is in your back (In your back)

[Verse 2]
(Instrumental)

[Hook]
Ok I walked inside this bitch with both my hands up
I got exotic rims on my chair you can't stand us
Brrrr bop bop bop bop you even if you got your hands up
My bitch screaming love peace and happiness, no Canada
I'm in love with birds
I can whip a bird (Hey)
My old lady think you a turd
And I'm from A-Town and I need birds (Yeah! Hey!)

[Verse 1]
We're all hoping, we're all hopeless
We're all thorns and we're all roses
We're all looking down our noses at ourselves
We're all flawed and we're all perfect
We're all lost and we're all hurting
And just searching for somebody to love

[Verse 2]
We're all liars, we're all legends
We're all tens that want elevens
We're all trying to get to heaven, but not today
We're all happy, we're all hatin'
We're all patiently impatient
And just waiting for somebody to love

[Chorus]
We're all good, but we ain't angels
We all sin, but we ain't devils
We're all pots and we're all kettles
But we can't see it in ourselves
We're all livin' 'til we're dying
We ain't cool, but man, we're trying
Just thinking we'll be fixed by someone else

[Verse 3]
We all wrangle with religion
We all talk, but we don't listen
We're all starving for attention, then we run
We're all paper, we're all scissors
We're all fightin' with our mirrors
Scared we'll never find somebody to love

[Chorus]
We're all good, but we ain't angels
We all sin, but we ain't devils
We're all pots and we're all kettles
But we can't see it in ourselves
We're all livin' 'til we're dying
We ain't cool, but man, we're trying
Thinking we'll be fixed by someone else

[Verse 4]
Just tryin' to hold it all together
We all wish our best was better
Just hopin' that forever's really real
We'll miss a dime to grab a nickel
Overcomplicate the simple
We're all little kids just looking for love
Yeah, don't we all just want somebody to love?

[Intro: DMX]
Hey you see
This the shit, I be talkin 'bout, know'msayin?
When you don't know, what the fuck is really good know'msayin?
You feel one way, but you know you gotta walk the other way

[Chorus: DMX]
Aiyyo dawg, listen I love that bitch
Cause of some bullshit I don't trust that bitch
Cause of the kid I'm stuck with that bitch
But my niggas like, "Yo FUCK THAT BITCH!!"

[DMX]
Aiyyo it's like this man, shorty got a kid
On some drunk after the club shit, we done did
All these bitches got me hittin the Remy, full throttle
By the time I finish the bottle them bitches is models
Let me break it down like this, here's what happened
I was y'know, tryin to fuck and, once I get to rappin
We at the crib, bitches leave they panties on the doorknob
Puff somethin, ten minutes later we on the floor hard
AH! AH! Huffin and puffin
She screamed it more cause she can't get enough of the lovin
Now, look where it got us, nine months later
Baby is born and I'm realizin I hate her

[Chorus] - 2X

[DMX]
"YOU DON'T GOTTA CHILL WITH HER!" Man, they don't know
I'm still with her cause I'm tryin to see the baby grow
That's just the pops in me, see I ain't never had one
And now that I am a father I don't wanna be a bad one
As shorty get older, how do I explain
That I really can't stand his mother? She a pain!
And I never really liked the bitch, out the gate
It was those two bottles of Remy, plus it was gettin late
Now I ain't say I ain't had nothin to do or to blame
Man I'm the Dog, bitches stay screamin my name
She knew it was a fuck thing, she ain't my wife
So why I gotta pay for her for the rest of my life?

[Chorus] - 2X

[DMX]
Child support? You're killin me! But it gets worse
Moms got a thirst that'll get her put in a hearse
Some say it's like a curse, the way she got me locked down
It feel like I'm trapped and I'm tryin to get out now
From the beginnin, shit was cool
Check it, a nigga was hungry and this bitch was food
And I, wanted to eat 'til the Dog got full
Cause I knew how I felt and the things that I would do
Bust it~! From the beginnin you had my mind goin
Look forward to seein you every time knowin
Couldn't see shit cause, love was blind
Fuck it, that liquor is what gets you blind
REAL TALK!

[Chorus] - 2X

[Jannyce] + (DMX)
I told you so (yo dawg, listen I love that bitch)
Not to fool with hoes (but I don't trust that bitch)
Cause that's the way it goes (but I'm stuck with that bitch)
I told you so (my niggas like, "Man fuck that bitch")
I told you so (aiyyo dawg, listen I love that bitch)
Not to fool with hoes (but I don't trust that bitch)
Cause that's the way it goes (but here I'm stuck with that bitch)
I told you so (now niggas like, "Man fuck that bitch")

[Outro: DMX]
Bitch! Fuckin bitch, bitch! Fuckin bitch, stupid bitch
Stanky bitch, fuckin bitch! Bitch, punk ass bitch
Ugly bitch, bitch, fuckin nerves hate you bitch
Fuck that bitch, bitch!

[Intro]
Thugger Thugger, baby

[?], what it do slimeball?
Get this money, nigga
Let's get it, woo

[Chorus]
I got a thick bitch, I know how to dress her
I ran my money up, then iced out my bezel
A lot of thick bitches coming by the zeroes
And I didn't show none of this bitches the schedule
I gotta horse looking bitch that like to wrestle
I got all my niggas looking so successful
I wan' fuck all these lil' bitches like R. Kelly
I'm the reason why these lil' niggas looking scary
All my niggas, we gon' leave this life daily
I want a bitch from San Diego Bay
I swear to God I want that pussy, I would pay
Calm down, boy, I'm home, you away
Okay, my bitch let me dive from the dresser
Boy, I done been to a hundred islands, no dressing
I want to teach you like Thug a professor
I think she did pray to God 'cause I'm a blessing (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
And I got a thick bitch, I know how to dresser
I'ma walk straight up on that lil' bitch and I'ma press her
Baby, I'm the king, Elvis Presley (King)
Baby don't wan' come out that dream, she super waking
Suck my motherfucking Nutty Buddy (Nutty)
Even if I'm legally blind I'm still busting (Bitch)
Even when I was dead broke, bitch,I wasn't bluffing (Racks)
I won't get five percent without my muddy
Riding 'round the city with my daddy
Real gold on, bitch, I need a Grammy
Fuck, I'm too geeked up, I need some dabbies (Rrt!)
Got gas, can't smell nobody
YSL got racks, no wallets (Racks)
That's all you see, lil' baby (Big)
Still geeked up in the lobby (Ah)
You know the routine, lil' baby (Routine)
I might buy a hot Benz, change the VIN on it (Skrrt)
I might walk inside club and go Sudan on it (Woo)
I might shoot a gun at you 'bout my fan, homie
Not playin' got a band with saran on it (And)
Stayed down with me and my man, homie (And)
Got a bottle full of Hen and a Xan on it (And)
You can pull all of my tips in the can homie (What?)
If the guy ain't seen put the man on it (Woo)

[Chorus]
I got a thick bitch, I know how to dress her
I ran my money up, then iced out my bezel
A lot of thick bitches coming by the zeroes
And I didn't show none of this bitches the schedule
I gotta horse looking bitch that like to wrestle

[Verse 1]
Do we really have to grow up?
If we never do, then so what?
So what if I don't wanna, what if I'm just gonna
Stay drunk on all the years that I just wish would slow up?

[Chorus]
We can't do it over
They say it's now or never and all we're ever gettin' is older
Before we get to heaven, baby, let's give 'em hell
We might as well
'Cause we don't know when we're done
So let's love hard, live fast, die fun

[Verse 2]
Let's put a little more in your glass
Walk around and spend all our cash
Just let me grab my poncho, I don't care where we go
If we speak the language you know we don't even have to come back

[Chorus]
We can't do it over
They say it's now or never and all we're ever gettin' is older
Before we get to heaven, baby, let's give 'em hell
We might as well
'Cause we don't know when we're done
So let's love hard, live fast, die fun

[Chorus]
We can't do it over
They say it's now or never and all we're ever gettin' is older
Before we get to heaven, baby, let's give 'em hell
We might as well
'Cause we don't know when it's done
So let's love hard
Let's stay young
Let's love hard, live fast, die fun
Die fun
We can't do it over

[Verse 1]
There's certain things you're s'posed to know
When you're a girl who grows up in the south
I try to use my common sense
But my foot always ends up in my mouth
And if I had to walk a runway in high heels in front of the whole town
I'd fall down
And my mama cried
When she realized

[Chorus 1]
I ain't pageant material
I'm always higher than my hair
And it ain't that I don't care about world peace
But I don't see how I can fix it in a swimsuit on a stage
I ain't exactly Ms. Congenial
Sometimes I talk before I think, I've tried to fake it but I can't
I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't

[Verse 2]
God bless the girls who smile and hug
When they're called out as a runner up on TV
I wish I could, but I just can't
Wear a smile when a smile ain't what I'm feelin'
And who's to say I'm a 9.5
Or a 4.0 if you don't even know me
Life ain't always roses and pantyhose
And...

[Chorus 1]
I ain't pageant material
I'm always higher than my hair
And it ain't that I don't care about world peace
But I don't see how I can fix it in a swimsuit on a stage
I ain't exactly Ms. Congenial
Sometimes I talk before I think, I've tried to fake it but I can't
I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't

[Intstrumental bridge]

[Chorus 2]
I ain't pageant material
The only crown is in my glass
They won't be handin' me a sash
And that's okay, cause there's no way
You'll ever see me in a swimsuit on a stage
I ain't exactly Ms. Congenial
Sometimes I talk before I think, I've tried to fake it but I can't
I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't
Yeah I'd rather lose for what I am than win for what I ain't

[Verse 1]
Your heart's as heavy as the stones you throw
Can't see the flowers for the weeds you grow
You blow your bubbles just to watch 'em burst
For you it's always bad to worse

[Chorus]
And you... can't win unless you lose
You try to tell me you want happiness
But you ain't happy unless
You're miserable

[Verse 2]
Your neighbor's dirty laundry's cleaner
And the wolf at your door's always meaner
Your sky's still grey when the sun's around
But you can't set sail with your anchor down

[Chorus]
And you... can't win unless you lose
You try to tell me you want happiness
But you ain't happy unless
You're miserable
I'm miserable

[Bridge]
Can't laugh enough for the both of us
Be half enough for the whole of us
If misery loves company
Then I can't keep you company no more
You
You
You

[Chorus]
You... can't win unless you lose
You try to tell me you want happiness
But you ain't happy unless
You're miserable

[Verse 1]
I don't need a membership to validate
The hard work I've put in and the dues I've paid
Never been too good at just goin' along
I guess I've always kinda been for the underdog

[Bridge 1]
Favors for friends will get you in and get you far
Shouldn't be about who it is you know
But about how good you are

[Chorus]
Don't wanna be part of the good ol' boys club
Cigars and handshakes, appreciate you, but no, thanks
Another gear in a big machine don't sound like fun to me
Don't wanna be part of the good ol' boys club

[Verse 2]
There's a million ways to dream and that's just fine
Oh, but I ain't losin' any sleep at night
And if I end up goin' down in flames
Well, at least I know I did it my own way
Hey, hey, ey, ey

[Chorus]
Don't wanna be part of the good ol' boys club
Cigars and handshakes, appreciate you, but no, thanks
Another gear in a big machine don't sound like fun to me
I don't wanna be part of the good ol' boys club

[Bridge 2]
Favors for friends will get you in and they'll get you far
But when did it become about who you know
And not about how good you are?

[Chorus]
Don't wanna be part of the good ol' boys club
Cigars and handshakes, appreciate you, but no, thanks
Another gear in a big machine don't sound like fun to me
I don't wanna be part of the good ol' boys club
I don't wanna be part of your good ol' boys club

[Verse 1]
I pick those tomatoes we grew off the vine
They look out the window, just killing time
I reach for the phone just to make sure it's on
And I'm fine
I put on my makeup for no one at all
My heels on the hardwood echo down the hall
And I open the wardrobe, put my face in your clothes
And I'm fine

[Chorus]
I try to sleep, I just lie here awake
I've stopped counting sheep, now I just count the days
'Til you're back in this bed that I remake every time
And if they ask, I'll say I'm fine

[Verse 2]
Just like the circus, you always leave town
I can't help but cry when that big top comes down
But I leave the light on and when you get back home
We'll be fine

[Chorus]
And I'll try to sleep but just lie here awake
I've stopped counting sheep, now I just count the days
'Til you're back in this bed that I remake every time
And if they ask, I'll say I'm fine

[Bridge]
They always say you don't get to choose
The same old cliché, love chooses you
So, baby, I'll wait just like I always do

[Chorus]
And I'll try to sleep, but just lie here awake
I've stopped counting sheep, now I just count the days
'Til you're back in this bed that I remake every time
And if they ask, I'll say I'm fine

[Outro]
Hmm, hmm

[Verse 1: Kacey Musgraves]
Look around you, look down the bar from you
At the faces that you see
Are you sure this is where you wanna be?
These are your friends, but are they real friends?
Do they love you as much as me?
Are you sure this is where you wanna be?
You seem in such a hurry
To lead this kind of life
And you cause so many things
Misery

[Chorus: Willie Nelson]
So look around you, and take a good look
At all the local used-to-be's
Are you sure that this is where you want to be?

[Verse 2: Kacey Musgraves]
Please don't let my tears persuade you
I'd hoped I wouldn't cry
Although lately teardrops seem a part of me

[Chorus: Willie Nelson, Both]
So look around you, and take a good look
At all the local used-to-be's
Are you sure that this is where you want to be?

[Verse 1]
I couldn't figure why you couldn't give me what everybody needs
I shouldn't let you kick me when I'm down, my baby
I find out everybody know that you've been using me
I'm surprised you let me stay around you
One day I'm gonna lift the cover and look inside your heart
We gotta level before we go and tear this love apart

[Chorus]
There's no fight you can't fight
This battle of love with me, you win again
So little time, we do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through, you win again
Some never try, but if anybody can, we can
And I'll be, I'll be, following you (I'll be, I'll be)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, girl

[Verse 2]
Oh, baby, I shake you from now on
I'm gonna break down your defenses, one by one
I'm gonna hit you from all sides, lay your fortress open wide
Nobody stops this body from taking you
You better beware, I swear
I'm gonna be there one day when you fall
I could never let you cast aside the greatest love of all

[Chorus]
There's no fight you can't fight
This battle of love with me, you win again
So little time, we do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through, you win again
Some never try, but if anybody can, we can
And I'll be, I'll be, following you (I'll be, I'll be)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, girl

[Chorus / Outro]
You win again
So little time, we do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through, you win again
Some never try, but if anybody can, we can
And I'll be, I'll be, following you (I'll be, I'll be)
Oh, oh girl
You win again
So little time, we do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth (No life)
No other could see me through, you win again
(No other could, no other could)
Some never try, but if anybody can, we can
There's no fight you can't fight
This battle of love with me, you win again (This battle of love)
So little time, we do nothing but compete
There's no life on earth
No other could see me through, you win again
Some never try, but if anybody can, we can
There's no fight you can't fight
This battle of love with me, you win again
So little time, we do nothing but compete

[Intro]
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la

[Chorus 1]
Do what you want
I'm telling you
Let me into your heart

[Verse 1]
Can't stand it, backhanded
They wanna see us falling apart
You know that I love you
So let me into you

[Chorus 2]
Let me into your heart
(Do you really love me?
I'ma get you, girl, ahhh!)

[Verse 2]
This is the end of us
Sleeping with the moon and the stars
I know where you've been
You can see us far then near

[Chorus 3]
Let me into your heart
Oh, this ain't no bullshit
I really love you, girl
Oh, oh God

[Bridge]
Girl you really got a hold on me
So this isn't just puppy love
Girl you really got a hold on me
So this isn't just puppy love

[Outro]
I'm in love when we are smokin' that
Oh my God, I
Let me in
Girl you really got a hold, woo!

[Verse 1]
Lately I've been throwing hints around there, I've been tryna get you to
Ooh, tryna get you to talk about it, what do I gotta do to
To get you to see (See) them other dudes, they ain't me?
They wanna show you the same thing you already seen
I know you got another try in ya, oh, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, baby (Oh, baby)
Girl, I know your other man must have hurt you so, baby (So, baby)
Tell me why you got me on hold, baby (Oh)
Can you just give me the chance (Give me the chance)
I should've had before, baby? (Oh, baby)
Give it a chance, girl (Uh), one more gin (Uh-huh, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Whatever happened before you had me, girl, that don't matter no more (Oh)
And I don't want to lie and say I'ma take it away when I know I won't
Girl, I know I can make you forget about him, I can show you how to live, live without him
I go hard in the paint, girl, it ain't what you think
Please believe it I can do it, oh, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, baby (Oh)
Girl, I know your other man (I know your other man didn't do you) must have hurt you so, baby (But girl, it wasn't me, oh)
Tell me why you got me on hold, baby (Why you keeping me waiting?)
Can you just give me the chance
I should've had before, baby? (Oh)
Give it a chance, girl (Hey, hey), one more gin (Oh)

[Bridge]
I know you've heard it all before so, baby, I'ma just get right to it
And if you let it flow, I'll give it to you
And make you see that, that I'm what you need in your life
Let me show you how to do it right

[Chorus]
Oh, baby (Oh)
Girl, I know your other man (Girl, I know your other man) must of hurt you so, baby (He must have hurt you before, but baby, I know it won't happen, I'm old)
Girl, tell me why you got me on hold, baby (Hold, baby)
Can you just give me the chance
I should've had before, baby? (I should've had before)
Give it a chance, girl, one more gin
Oh, baby (Girl)
Girl, I know your other man must of hurt you so, baby
Why you got me on hold, baby?
Can you just give me the chance I should've had before, baby?
Give it a chance, girl, one more gin

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
You got that look in your eyes, eyes
I can tell you had bad dreams last night
Let me take you in my arms; you can cry, cry
Let me love you 'til you feel alright
'Cause I am yours; you are mine, you are mine, mine
Not going anywhere, I am standing by your side
I will love you 'til the end of time, time
I will love you 'til the day we die

[Chorus: Sia]
Don't fear, baby, 'cause you and me are golden
When you can't breathe, it's you that I'll be holdin'
Yes, I'm all in, through thick and thin
This is good loving; you and me are golden

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
I gotta give it to her, she got a mean golden eye game
Honestly it’s not a lot of O's to fit the rhyme scheme
But fuck it, for the sake of being overly cheesy
I think it's cute we both like our eggs over easy
And lately, I've been losing at love
But when you lookin' in the Lower East Side
You're bound to find nothing but bad luck
Days can drift by, but I don't give a damn if you with me
Even if the Earth exploded, I probably wouldn't notice
Never has another narrowed down the field to nada
Spend our days shopping at Target, 'cause she’s not concerned with Prada
We make hand-me-downs look designer
Golden's in the eye of the beholder
Love ya, girl

[Chorus: Sia]
Don't fear, baby, 'cause you and me are golden
When you can't breathe, it's you that I'll be holdin'
Yes, I'm all in, through thick and thin
This is good loving; you and me are golden

[Post-Chorus: Sia]
You and me are golden
You and me are golden
You and me are golden
You and me are golden

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
And honestly, she ain't even gotta say much
I'll wait a whole day for that Midas touch
Minus the fact she's the finest eyelids could open to
My highness, I'd travel the world and back in hopes to glow with you
She’s the Patti Mayonnaise to my Doug Funnie
Every kiss is 24 carats, no Bugs Bunny
I used to live wild (Wild); she made me slow it down (Down)
Who knows? Maybe one day, we'll have a golden child
Haha, and that’s word to Eddie Murphy
I wouldn't trade places if you threatened to hurt me
Two peas in a pod that could never be open
I’m cool all by myself, but together we golden, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
You got that look in your eyes, eyes
I can tell you had bad dreams last night
Let me take you in my arms; you can cry, cry
Let me love you 'til you feel alright
'Cause I am yours; you are mine, you are mine, mine
Not going anywhere, I am standing by your side
I will love you 'til the end of time, time
I will love you 'til the day we die

[Chorus: Sia]
Don't fear, baby, 'cause you and me are golden
When you can't breathe, it's you that I'll be holdin'
Yes, I'm all in, through thick and thin
This is good loving; you and me are golden
We are golden, I ain't goin' anywhere

[Verse 1: Prince]
Come on over here, baby
Uh
Put your ass right down here on this throne
Yeah
Don't you say nary a little word
Until you learn how to leave
Leave that devil alone
Let me run it down
I keep your paper coming in real steady
I could tell you what the "I" in the pimp stands for
If you're ready, ready, ready
Your eyes are wide shut
You cannot even see
That behind your back
He calls you names
But you're still a queen to me

[Chorus: Prince]
In this trusting place
You can erase
Every tear
That ever rolled down your weary face
All the time you waste
In that paper chase
Is time better spent in these arms of mine
Heaven sent
Angel so divine
You're my complement
You make my sun shine
You make my sun shine at night
(Ooh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh)

[Verse 2: Angie Stone]
Listen to me now, baby
Let me tell you what I gotta do
(Tell you)
I gotta stop letting the devil
(Define what it takes to be a woman)
Stop letting him tell me
What it takes to be a woman
Gotta never stop
Believing in me, myself, and I
Pretty little lies
That the rich keep using
I opened up my eyes
The only reason they're winning
Is 'cause I keep losing
Gotta get back to my right place
This is the subject of my show
We love the human race
This is where I belong

[Chorus: Angie Stone and Milenia]
In this trusting place
You can erase
Every tear
That ever rolled down your weary face
All the time you waste
In that paper chase
Is time better spent in these arms of mine
Heaven sent
Angel so divine
You're my complement
You make my sun shine

[Bridge: Prince]
Wonderfully
Truly caring
You make the words I wish in every song
Come here now, pretty baby
Let me take you somewhere
And put you real close
We've both been in the dark much too long
Now that we got the knowledge and the truth
We can both be strong
Kings and Queens
Getting it on

[Chorus: Prince and Angie Stone]
Trusted place you can erase
Every tear
That ever rolled down your weary face
All the time you waste
(Wasted time)
In that paper chase
Can't you see
That it's all time better spent right here
Is time better spent in these arms of mine
(Sweet angel)
Heaven sent
Angel so divine
(You're so divine)
You're my complement
You make my sun shine
You make my sun shine at night

[Outro: Prince and Angie Stone]
Can you feel me?
Sun shine
Sun shine
Sun shine at night
Doobay, doobay, doobay, doo
Angel so divine
(Ooh, ooh ooh)
Well, well, yeah
(Ooh, ooh ooh)
Making us strong
(Oh yeah)
(Ooh, ooh ooh)
In the mornin' sun shine, sun shine
(Ooh, ooh ooh)
Say it again
(Hold on)
(Ooh, ooh ooh)
Angel, angel mighty divine
(Ooh, ooh ooh)
(Yeah, yeah)
Tell that devil to leave you alone
(Yeah)
Yeah...
(Ooh, ooh ooh)
It's such a shame, yeah
(Ooh, ooh ooh)
Forever, baby, holding me
(Ow!)
(Ooh)

[Intro]
When will we be paid
For the work we've done?
When will we be paid
For the work we've done?

[Verse 1]
We fought in your wars in every land
To keep this country free, y'all
For women, children and men
But every time
We ask for pay or a loan
That's when everything seems to turn out wrong

We been beat up
Called names
Shot down and stoned
Every time we do right
Somebody say we're wrong

[Chorus]
Tell me
When will we be paid
For the work we've done
When will we be paid
For the work we've done

[Verse 2]
Listen
We worked this country
From shore to shore
Our women cooked all your food
And washed all your clothes

We picked cotton
And laid the railroad steel
Worked our hands
Down to the bone at your lumber mill

[Chorus]
Tell me
When will we be paid
For the work we've done?
When will we be paid
For the work we've done?

[Bridge]
Will we ever be proud of
"My country, tis of thee"?
Will we ever sing out loud
"Sweet land of Liberty"?
When will we be paid
For the work we've done?
I wanna know
I wanna
I wanna
I wanna know
(When, when, when, when)

[Chorus]
When will we be paid
For the work we've done?
When will we be paid
For the work we've done?

Why can't we be paid?
Oh, oh
When
When will we be paid?
We've given up our sweat
Now

[Outro]
And all of our tears
Stumbled through this life
For more than three hundred years
I
I wanna know
The work we've done

[Verse 1]
She arrived on a 747
About 20 to 11
She comes to see him
Him as in me
She comes to see
And it's never complicated
Other women cannot fade it
Whenever I call
She gets dressed up and all

[Chorus]
Supercute
Maybe it's cause
She comes from East L.A
But every time I see her body on display
I gotta call her name from the DJ booth
Strobe light flash
And you know the truth
Baby got game
She'll take your loot
Keys to the crib
With no dispute
See her dancing in her birthday suit
Supercute

[Verse 2]
Together we wonder
How we got enslaved and why
It's time to get freedom for our people
And Jericho falls when we all discern the lie
Yo, why the man wanna lie?
I look at her eyes
Go wild, she smiles

[Chorus]
Supercute
Maybe it's cause
She comes from East L.A
But every time I see her body on display
I gotta call her name from the DJ booth
Strobe light flash
And you know the truth
Baby got game
She'll take your loot
Keys to the crib
With no dispute
See her dancing in her birthday suit

[Verse 3]
On a dare
I wanna see if she will share
The kinda toys she uses when I'm not there
None at all
She swears
I don't care
I make her buy another one
And a new dress to wear
Goes the toy against her curly hair
Now she must confess
How she really like to play
Or if she don't
I lower the speed
And bad words she'll say
Tell me how you play
How you play
Even in her anger
She's still

[Chorus]
Supercute
Maybe it's cause
She comes from East L.A
But every time I see her body on display
I gotta call her name from the DJ booth
Strobe light flash
And you know the truth
Baby got game
She'll take your loot
Keys to the crib
With no dispute
See her dancing in her birthday suit
Supercute
When you see her dancing in her birthday suit

[Outro]
Shake it around
When you see her dancing in her birthday suit
Supercute
Supercute

[Intro]
Hey, yo, yo
Yeah, hey

[Chorus]
Her swag (Swag)
Her swag gon' kill 'em like bang bang (Killin' 'em, killin' 'em)

Bang, bang, bang, bang

[Verse 1]
Ayy, ayy, ayy lil' lady
I wanna know if you're a rider
Replace the windows on Phantoms with that fibre
You on fire like a lighter (Oh yeah)
Walk with your hands in your back (What?)
Walk with my hands in your crack (What?)
I'm your lil' baby, no Similac (No Similac)
She don't wanna know what they say she not into that
She just wanna be around the Young Thugger like puppet (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh-wee, I just wanna buy you a new Rollie (Bling)
Jewelry gold like trophies and she told me (Told me)
I know this, she rollie like Rollie Pollie Ollie
Ooh, I wanna shout like no way
Her booty bigger than a burger at Five Guys
She wanna ride a young nigga like a Six Flags ride
I'm like dammit, girl you jamming, you got swag

[Chorus]
Her swag (Swag)
Her swag gon' kill 'em like bang bang (Killin' 'em, killin' 'em)

Her class gon' kill 'em like bang bang (No school, but she got class, haha)
Her swag gonna (Ayy)
Her swag gon' kill 'em like bang bang (Like bang bang)
She got that class on
She got that class, gon' kill 'em like bang bang (Ooh)
Bang, bang, bang, bang

[Verse 2]
Ooh, I wanna love you (Ooh)
I'll never ever put her above you (Ooh)
Put that brrr in your ear just like mugs do (Brrr)
Oh my God, even your mud the truth (God)
Drop them bands right on it (What?)
Put them plans right on it (Plans)
I'll be snaking like 'condas ('Condas)
Put my bands right on it (Bands)
Let her slime a little (What?)
Let her sign a little (A little)
She got sinus a little (A little)
Now her nose filled with boogers (Brrr)
I can't be standing near these strippers, no
She got her hands inside my pants everywhere we go (Hey)
And they know (Hey), I eat 'em like Eggo (Hey)
She drink me like Faygo (What?)
I'm sliming like egg rolls
Man, man, man, man, man, man
I got bands, plans, lance sand tan, tan, tan
She make her love her like amigo
Giving me those kilos for zero, she got swag

[Chorus]
Her swag (Swag)
Her swag gon' kill 'em like bang bang (Killin' 'em, killin' 'em)
I said her class (Her class)
Her class gon' kill 'em like bang bang (No school, but she got class, haha)

Her swag gon' kill 'em like bang bang (Like bang bang)
She got that class on
She got that class, gon' kill 'em like bang bang (Ooh)
Bang, bang, bang, bang

[Verse 1]
Baby, you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

[Chorus]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 2]
You know, sometimes, baby, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes, again, it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

[Chorus]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Bridge]
If I seem edgy, I want you to know
I never meant to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do 'cause I love you

[Verse 3]
Oh, baby, I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?
Sometimes I find myself alone regretting some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Outro]
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood

[Intro]
Hey girl
Can you turn down the bass some more?
It's still pounding
There we go

[Verse 1]
I just got your text message
That you want me to join you home
Well my reluctance would be less threatening
If you told me what you had on
So this what happen soon as I get home
Damn girl it feels good yeah right there
Can't you tell I'm serious by my tone
But I can't see your eyes move your hair
Is it possible for you to still moan
Did you know this is changing my life do you care
Do you believe that my mind's been blown
Oh shit I swear, that
I'm your guy, I'm your man to be
I can make anything happen all of a sudden
But, you're the girl, you're my fantasy
And when you kiss me there it pushes love's button
So

[Chorus]
It seems you've licked my creamsicle down
Thought it couldn't get no better no more
I jump on when you make that sound
In two minutes I'll get you one more

[Verse 2]
So perfect girl
Your pink cookies on top of those ICECREAM scoops
I want your nectar girl
You're so naked sweet
But now your peach should be dripping this juice

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Never get addicted 'less the headywap is serious
I never get addicted 'less the headywap is serious (it's just a record...)
I never get addicted 'less the headywap is serious (I ain't talkin' to no other girls what you talkin' 'bout it's just a record...)
I never get addicted 'less the headywap is serious

[Verse 3]
Baby, don't be lookin' at the speaker
You know that's not the way I treat ya
Never mind the song you're my girl
If you want me to you know I'll freak ya
You don't know how you know I'll teach ya
But not too dirty baby you're my girl
Shiiit...

[Chorus]

Got two cheeks, use your booty for the A.T.M
Credit cards, take off your bra have a ménage
Particular, vehicular, call me the sarge'
Grown booty from the A-Town
Pull her hair, can't see nothin' from the waist down
For them dollars make her holler like, "Whoa"
And my transactions got them Jacksons, Michael
Haha, you corny rappers can't be serious

You can tell by the swag
That the young'n gettin' dough
Not a rookie in the game
I'm a certified pro
Gettin' Bugs Bunny money
I'm with Warner Brothers, ho
If they haven't heard about him
Then you ought to let 'em know
Nigga straight up out the hood
But gettin' dough for every show
I'm the Prince, do my thing on you, bro
Gettin' Bugs Bunny money
I'm with Warner Brothers, ho
If they haven't heard about him
Then you ought to let 'em know
Gettin' Bugs Bunny money
I'm with Warner Brothers, ho
If they haven't heard about him
Then you ought to let 'em know
Nigga straight up out the hood
But gettin' dough for every show
I'm the Prince, do my thing on you bitches
Tell 'em "Lets talk money", T-Pain on you bitches
I be ridin' real high, switchin' lanes on you bitches
50 box of cigarillos, got a thang for them Swishers
Still the same lil nigga, never change for them figures
I see me a bad bitch, I get a name and the digits
And my aim is to split it
I like a little bus down
She ain't with the bullshit
And like it when I come 'round
Yeah, you see me, you'll see a cloud of smoke
Blowin' on Jamaican
Bought the pound straight up out the boat
My city show me love
There be them clown niggas talkin' though
I make the money pile
Make her smile
When I spark a O
Weed smellin' tropical
To me you're not a obstacle
I run through everyone one of y'all
I see you tryna stop him though
Haters on scope
A nigga wanna act up
Breeze got the front
And Big Lonnie got backup
I roll a sack up
Gotta stay high
I'm a fresh young nigga, so I gotta stay fly
And I'm married to the game, so my cake is to the sky
Yeah I'm gettin' all this money, it don't make you wonder why
I'm the truth, no lie for you fuckers
Got a bitch like Snoop, from The Wire for you fuckers
And you tired motherfuckers
Can keep sleepin'
'Cause y'all dreamin'
I'm out livin', smokin', chillin'
Ask your bitch 'bout the kid, I'm so appealin'
I get that money up from floor to ceilin'
Motherfucker
Get up
Yeah
(Warner Brothers records)
I'm that nigga
It's Grow Season, bitch

[Verse]
Grow
Told y'all y'all was gonna bump my shit
Y'all didn't think the Burgh'd jump like this
Ask anyone one around me, say they want young Wiz
5 cigarillos, I'mma smoke my piff
Told y'all y'all was gonna bump my shit
Y'all didn't think the Burgh'd jump like this
Told y'all y'all was gonna bump my shit
Y'all didn't think the Burgh'd jump like this
Ask anyone one around me, say they want young Wiz
5 cigarillos, I'mma smoke my piff
I'mma get that money, homie
Fuck that bitch
Paid like lids
So they want my chips
I'm the boss like Tony
The tall young homie
And they heard the good news
So now the broads jump on me
Claimin that your hot boy, why don't y'all show me?
I'm the best in my city bitch, all y'all know it
You cats skip tracks and just slum talk on it
I walk Pittsburgh, diddy bop all on it
I'm high all day, I Ray and Patron it
A sit still bitch looking for the best kiss here
Face it, I'm in a situation like win-win
Nigga you a loser, that ain't what I'm used to
I'm kinda peaceful, but my guy here'll shoot ya
In the stud' latenight, rise with the roosters
That's what I call a grind lil trooper
Niggas thinking past tense - I am the future
Make a boss move, I got eyes for me junior
Hit a mold, in it with a hold like tune ya
Niggas think they nicer, 21 chew me up
Little do they know that I'm a pro, now I ruin ya
I ride two to ya, show ya how I do this
Straight cash while you niggas stay stash-clueless
In the line, I switch the lane and pass through ya
Life bout to change, need a new chain from my jeweler
And my age it'll fool ya
I do it big but truth is I just made it outta school bruh
And my flow is peculiar
I rep Pittsburgh to the death
Hatin nigga, kill yourself

[Outro]
So go on kill yourself you bitchass nigga
'07, Grow Season, get up

Nigga, and arch that back

Yeah, nigga, smoke that

[Verse 1: Tyga]
I, I know a little bitch by the name Shanelle
Always wearin' Louis, but fake Chanel
I'm just tryin' to nut like Chip and Dale
That's some funny-ass shit like Dave Chappelle
Pussy-ass niggas all in my mail
How you get out early? You ain't make that bail
Snitchin' ain't free, but all you do is tell
I heard you breakin' bad, but the shit won't sell
Yeah, all in your momma car wit' no Ls
Now she can't make work, son, you dumb as hell
Need a ghetto bitch wit' long-ass nails
To scratch a nigga back and cook my meals
I got Gs on the block, bitches on the cock
It ain't a house party 'til somebody get shot
Want fifty in the pot, play the scene, they gon' flock
Have a all-white party, niggas hangin' off the yachts
Bang your pistol, you too smart and little
I came wit' my tongue out, I'm high from the free throw
Pussy is mental, it's too good, I sin for
Run up all in it, I'ma be here for a minute, bitch

[Chorus: Tyga]
Nigga, and she bounce that back
My dog tryin' to knick-knack, give a dog a paddywhack
Paddyback that, yeah, bounce it on my lap, lap

My dog tryin' to knick-knack, give a dog a paddywhack
Paddyback that, yeah, bounce it on my lap, lap
She's a real dick-pleaser

[Verse 2: Tyga]
This ain't rap and rap ain't this
Tell her, "Shut the fuck up and suck my dick"
She a real dick-pleaser, won't you face my dick
She likes dick, dick, dick and nothin' else but dick
She eat it like candy or Swedish Fish
My rim size satellites, that's a deep-ass dish
You niggas' money thinner than a Conehead bitch
No relationships, we ain't developin' shit
Shout-out all my bitcheses, you call them mistresses
I just hit and forget they even existeded
Ha, it's all the same though
I changed the lingo, gave her dangle, buried the dang ho
I'm fuckin' faster, I'm gettin' stronger
I hit her, she backwards, lickin' her asshole
My dick is the password
T nasty, 'bout to catch a felony for it
Vagina juice like orange juice in the mornin'

[Chorus: Tyga]
Nigga, and she bounce that back
My dog tryin' to knick-knack, give a dog a paddywhack
Paddyback that, yeah, bounce it on my lap, lap
She's a real dick-pleaser
Nigga, I tell her, "Arch that back"
My dog tryin' to knick-knack, give a dog a paddywhack
Paddyback that, yeah, bounce it on my lap, lap

[Verse 3: Boosie Badazz]
(Boosie Badazz)
This for Section 8 Taniqua, real dick-pleaser
Right to the side, right now I need her
Super bad, her body a trigger, you're mine to eat, uh
Suck and swallow, suck and swallow, smile make me weaker
Get it? Just stuck that Kardashian pussy
Business-minded, but most of all she nasty for me
And she wetter, she wetter, wetter than Niagra Falls
Turned-up sex appeal, she don't wear no drawers
I like girls who like girls, got to track Boosie
Now I'm prayin', tell you my ten is wit' the fat coochie
You know I ate it, whack the cat, paddywhack the cat
Give her two thumbs up cause she keep me comin' back
And she please me, ride it like a cowgirl
And she leakin', God, put down the towel, girl
Yeah, spontaneous head, spontaneous head
And she rained down on me, yeah

[Chorus: Tyga]
Nigga, and she bounce that back
My dog tryin' to knick-knack, give a dog a paddywhack
Paddyback that, yeah, bounce it on my lap, lap
She's a real dick-pleaser
Nigga, I tell her, "Arch that back"
My dog tryin' to knick-knack, give a dog a paddywhack
Paddyback that, yeah, bounce it on my lap, lap
She's a real dick-pleaser

I put your bitch in a Phantom, that shit big as a planet
Got some bitches in Paris that speakin' French like Montana
Got a bitch in the projects, she be holdin' her hammer
Landed in California, 'bout to go to Atlanta
To meet my bitch from Miami, she want beef on the table
I moonwalk in that pussy, she thinkin' she Billie Jean

Here I go, wring a nigga neck, all about a check, yeah, I know (bitch)

Hook game like Hopkins

Mixin' Cris' in the dark, cryin', grippin' the odds
Hit my man up, I had to go
Bulletproof sprinter, I be ridin' like the Pope, Montana

I just lie awake and think of pleasant nights we'd spend
Under summers magic spell
But when autumn came her love did not remain
And made my world a living hell

I just lie awake and think of pleasant nights we'd spend
Under summers magic spell
But when autumn came her love did not remain
And made my world a living hell

I just lie awake and think of pleasant nights we'd spend
Under summers magic spell
But when autumn came her love did not remain
And made my world a living hell

It's young Wiz
Uh-huh
A lot of niggas hatin', you know?
It's young Wiz
I'm doing this Pittsburgh shit
Putting it on the map
Uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
It's young Wiz
Uh-huh
A lot of niggas hatin', you know?
It's young Wiz
I'm doing this Pittsburgh shit
Putting it on the map
Uh-huh, you know
But I ain't worried about these niggas I got mad
You know? Them motherfuckers look stupid as hell
I'm out here gettin' money, 412
Lot of niggas mad
I see y'all niggas when I pull up
Yeah, they be like —

[Verse]
Goddamn, that's a fly young nigga
The smoke smell different, that's a high young nigga
And I heard he work hard, got a half-million rhymes
And my bitch hit his MySpace a half-million times
I laugh and get high, gettin' straight to the money
And keep my goons 'round for any fake nigga want it
'Cause niggas out here see you eatin' and take yours
That's why I'm in the lab and Big Breeze got the 8 for
A lot of y'all ain't got no cheese
Nothin' better else to do, that's why you talk 'bout me
I'm always on your girl mind, she think a lot 'bout me
But if it ain't about the money then it's not 'bout me
I be in 11:30, leaving out 'bout 3
Shawty ain't givin' me nothing, kick her out my 'vee
I live like a young rap star
Grind like a trap star
Couple came at the kid
But they ain't make it that far
V.I.P., that's what I'm sitting in the back for
Rollin' up grape, pull it straight up out the glass jar
Puff, puff, puff
And blow a little smoke out
Skinny little nigga, but my pockets all chunked out
A lot of y'all on my shit now didn't
Think Pittsburgh had a chance 'til they heard young Wiz
So I came and I put the city's name on me
Niggas got the nerve to hate on me —
Fuck y'all
I'm ridin' down the parkway doin' a buck, dawg
A bad little bitch, and somethin' to puff on
All you hatin' motherfuckers got somethin' to suck on
Just let a young'n do my thang, and I'm gone

[Interlude]
(Yeah man, this nigga wanna try to come at me the other day
Tryna hate on my man Wiz!
I had to shut this nigga down from the door
Let him know, man, that nigga's hot right here
That nigga's the truth
Quit hatin' — Fuck outta here)

[Outro]
I always stay fly
Niggas get mad if I come by
When they see me
When they see me
(Weeze)
Yeah...
My money gettin' right
They got jealousy in they eyes
When they see me
When they see me

[Verse 1: Rodney Tenor]
I'm sorta back, I'll quarterback yo' side chick
Hut, hut, one hike bitch, don't hide her, I'll find it
Hit it once then rewind it, hit it twice, then get blinded
We get blunted, I don't trust em, and I don't act like I love em
I finally finish, she finally famous
I finally did it, I found me a stranger
I took her to dinner, and then I got in it
I told her she ain't shit and then she replaced me
With some other nigga, she told me she hate how I roll
Better than dragging this chick on the road (road, road, road)
Better than taking this chick to my show
Get straight, keep pace or keep space from my face
No taste, a lot of ladies is sixth place
Type to get misplaced, drunk, and throwed
Shawty was getting old, and she ain't know that I was cold
And she always wanted more
Click, clack, boom, bap, goes the beat
When I can't keep shawty on her feet

[Bridge: Joba]
No more tears
No more fears
No more years
To waste on thoughts unclear

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I don't need you, I don't need one, I need some more
Treat me so bad, fuck you so good, oh yeah that's love
You need a hero, you need a hero, baby
You need a hero, you need a hero, baby
I don't need you, I don't need one, I need some more
Treat me so bad, fuck you so good, oh yeah that's love
You need a hero, you need a hero, baby
You need a hero, you need a hero, baby

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
You can't wait for love, that shit don't last forever
I can’t wait for you, that shit don’t last forever
I know you well, know you better than yourself
Know your ins and outs and curves
You swerving straight into your house
You know my name (know my name)
Say my name, touch yourself
We got issues (we got issues)
Know your frame, know your game
We got issues (we got issues)
Know I’m lame, know you same
We got issues (still got issues)
Keep it strange, no to blame
Fuck you and your shit
Swear you burn like matches' tip
Swear you fucked like half these kids
How'd I love on such a bitch?
Shoulda fucked up on your cousin
She look good even with black eyes
Next time that you say you love me
Baby I'll just ask why, yeah

[Bridge: Joba]
No more tears
No more fears
No more years
To waste on thoughts unclear

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I don't need you, I don't need one, I need some more

She run around and keep her whole spirit in it
She put her whole spirit in it
She turn around, she let the whole squad hit it
She let the whole squad hit it
She turn around, she let the whole squad hit it
She let the whole squad hit it
Ain't that a bitch? Face down that bitch
She turn around, disrespect that bitch
Ain't that a bitch? Face down that bitch
She turn around, disrespect that bitch

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I don't need you, I don't need one, I need some more

[Verse 1]
Did it all for you to say
You never wanted me that way
Now the dogs have had their meat
I think I'll go plug in the mains

[Chorus]
I tumble like a clown
Before your baying hounds
I supplicate myself into your hands

[Verse 2]
When you spare a make up smile
I'm instantly your biggest fan
How was I to know
That you practiced it beforehand?

[Chorus]
I tumble like a clown
Before your baying hounds
I supplicate myself into your hands

[Intro]
Woo! Woo!
Thugger!
Uh

[Verse 1]
Heard these niggas sneak dissing
I don't know how I'ma go about it
I had a bitch and then I left her
'Cause she think I like a bitch that used to show her body
These silly games ain't nothing serious
If she fresh I know she fuck for something on her body
I swear to God I'm so delirious
That a Coke frame would make me empty my pockets
Rollie pollie ollie nigga
I got three strikes and I ain't bowling nigga, psh
I been poppin' lots of shit when I was rich
The same shit poppin' with a quarter, nigga
Pockets are all swollen, nigga
I want that face like a emoji, nigga
I'm the same nigga boolin' on the block
Like it's never been a cop
Like my ring ain't worth a solar system

[Chorus]
Come with me to paradise
I'll be your king you are my wife
I've never been in love, oh my
I need you to complete these ties

[Verse 2]
Fuck a lake, I got fish here
Kill him, tell his momma get well
I'ma pull off watch me fishtail (Skrrrt)
Spelling YSL
Where my lean at, I need potion
I ride the beat, I never roll it
I never gave them swag, they stole it
I transform like I'm in Otis
Let's play a game, bankrolls on us
Fresh kids, there are never same clothes on us
We the slimes, big snakes, can't poison us
Hundos in my pockets and they ain't old as us
Pussy niggas get buried today
All my ex bitches might get embarrassed today
I'm high as all flight attendants today
Milk carton, your bitch is missing today

[Chorus]
Come with me to paradise
I'll be your king you are my wife
I've never been in love oh my
I need you to complete these ties

[Verse 3]
This nigga talking about this
And this nigga talking about that
And I don't know who to believe
To be honest I don't care
Just keep that lying shit over there
I don't want that germ on my team
One bitch sucking on my dick
Another bitch eating her from the back
Tell me who wanna join the scene?
I said who wants to join the scene?
Boss up
B-O-S-S nigga, boss up
Run that check up and blow a lil' some
Blow it then you stack it back up to the sun
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Come with me to paradise
I'll be your king you are my wife
I've never been in love oh my
I need you to complete these ties

[Intro]
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh

[Verse]
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, cool story but your vibe too off you bore me
And I be like, "True!"
Do you boo-boo, hah
Nobody gonna stop ya
Talking all that shit who'd want ya
Well your bitch friends ain't real partners
So I dip like a nickname salsa
And your bitch uptight like braids is
Need a fix so I call my barber
Ooh, bitch peep my posture
And I read like I'm on that rasta
Dish it out but you're gonna need armour
Where the fuck is my daughters and my boobies and my markers
My food game is too proper
Cause your bitch can't afford three lockers
Just get up and get obnoxious
Doing soo-soos in the whip
New dude, up crew, new hits, yeah
Doing soo-soos in the whip
New dude, up crew, new hits, yeah
You can't change my flaws, too sharp like a samurai sword
(Shiing!)
Revolutionary adored
Can't bite what the cat harbored
Yeah

[Hook]
Feeling good, feeling great, feeling great, feeling good how are you
Feeling good, feeling great, feeling great, feeling good how are you
Feeling good, feeling great, feeling great, feeling good how are you
Feeling good, feeling great, feeling great, feeling good how are you

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, like:
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, cool story but your vibe too off you bore me, hey
Uh-huh (Yeah)
Uh-huh (Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh)
Yeah, yeah, cool story but your vibe too off you bore me, hey
Cool story but your vibe too off you bore me, hey (Yeah)
Cool story (Yeah)
Cool story, hey (Yeah)
Cool story but your vibe too off you bore me, hey (Yeah)
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It's been a long day without you,my friend,                                  And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standin' right here talkin' to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But somethin' told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place, uh

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everythin' I went through, you were standin' there by my side
And now you gon' be wit' me for the last ride

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love'll never get lost
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line'll never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everythin' I went through, you were standin' there by my side
And now you gon' be wit' me for the last ride

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
So let the light guide your way
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take will always lead you home, home

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Yeah, girl, it's late at night and I'm driving
Over to your crib for some action
And I just can’t wait to put it down (Down)
I just wanna work you out (Out), I'm pulling up in your driveway
Could you keep the door unlocked? I'm coming in, girl
A nigga going up the stairs into the bedroom
A bubble bath, rose petals on the floor
We gon' do it all night, we gon' do it all night

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
So baby, can we play a little game?
Girl, your body on mine, up and down
Just make me work for it, work for it, baby

[Verse 2: Tank]
Girl, I been thinking 'bout you all night
How we hit them streets and tore it up 'til daylight
Yeah, with the top down spinning
Couldn't wait to get in and (Fuck it up, fuck it up), oh, oh
This DMV'll drive ya crazy
All up the stadium, tryna find a lady
Yeah, I gave a couple racks to a 10
And every time I'm in the city, we gon' get it in

[Pre-Chorus: Tank with Chris Brown]
So baby, can we play a little game?

I'm hella paid (Hella paid), h-hella paid (Hella paid), so I'ma fuck the city up (What? Look, ha)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
The nightlife rough, I fuck the city up
Ride this bitch all night, tell her giddy up
Champagne, some new drinks, some new bucks
My life’s too bright, thank my jeweler
This is the epitome of jealousy
When niggas expect me to strike out, like a felony
It’s not my intention to lash out, but you tellin' me
A nigga that he never be one of the
The greatest
Bitch, you hatin' 'cause a nigga made it
When I was cuttin' records in my fuckin' basement
A lil', lil' nigga couldn't get a placement
But like a spaceship I'm outta here and outta fear
You bring the uh and I buy the beer
Lookin' at my chain, it's like a chandelier
But these diamonds here and these diamonds real

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
So baby, can we play a little game? (Haha, yeah)
Girl, your body on mine, up and down (Shake it for me)
Just make me work for it, work for it, baby (Haha, work)
I'ma give you the business and girl, you gon' get when I start really using my tongue (Like), baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yeah girl (What?), whenever I'm in your city (Yeah!)
You know I'ma blow 'bout 50 (Ayy) and I'ma fuck the city up (Yeah, now, yeah)
I'ma give my love to you (Woo!), you (Woo!), I'ma fuck the city up (Yeah!)
I'm coming over, babe (Babe, over babe), over over, babe (Babe, over babe) and I'ma fuck the city up (Yeah, city up, yeah)
I'm hella paid (Yeah!), h-hella paid (Woo!), so I'ma fuck the city up

[Produced By: Xaphoon Jones]

[Verse 1]
I don't know if you belong to someone else
I know that I want you to myself
They might say I ain't shit for this
Just know that I meant everything I said to you for sure
If in fact that you decide
Well I wanna take it all up off of your body, for sure
If in fact that you'll be mine
I wanna take it all up off of your body

[Chorus]
Pretty miss Karrueche, I'm sippin' on this D'usse
I ain't throwin' no shade, I just want you to myself
Pretty miss Karrueche, I'm sippin' on this D'usse
I ain't throwin' no shade, I just want you to myself

[Bridge]
If I'm wrong then let me be wrong, let me be wrong, baby
For thinkin' that you don't need someone
I can make you feel like your heart won't do
Like it's you first time goin' strong, I want you to be mine for sure

[Verse 2]
Now if you decide, you'll say you'll be mine
Sit that ass by my side, ohh
Shawty, don't deny, I ain't askin' for a reply
Just hard to say goodbye, oh baby

[Chorus]
Pretty miss Karrueche, I'm sippin' on this D'usse

Pretty miss Karrueche, I'm sippin' on this D'usse
I ain't throwin' no shade, I just want you to myself

[Bridge]
If I'm wrong then let me be wrong, let me be wrong, baby
For thinkin' that you don't need someone

Make you feel like your heart won't do
Like it's you first time goin' strong, I want you to be mine

[Verse 3]
At the top sippin', baby
If I'm wrong, let me know, I gotta know
At the top sippin', baby
Can we smoke one more time? I gotta know
At the top sippin', baby
Just to go back to that night, all I want

[Outro]
I know what to do with it, I'ma keep it true with it
I know, I know what to do with it
A man can only dream of it, so I'ma dream of you
I know what to do with it, I'm not being rude with it
This ain't for Teyana, this one here for you, ohh baby
Bring your ass to Toronto, all I wanna do is
Bring you to the condo
So we can smoke
And you can let your stresses go
How personal

Nigga, you built like a bitch! You built like a bitch!
What you built like, biting the hand that fed you?

In a couple of years down the road, you realize you ain't that nigga
What you built like? You see that nigga, you hate that nigga
Man, you built like a bitch! Built like a bitch

[Verse 1]
You think I fly, but I like to crash and burn
I guess I'll just never learn
I'll never learn how to keep my cool
I try not to lose my head, but I just go black to red
I'm back to red now

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trembling, I-I-I'm trembling
I'm not listening, I-I-I'm trembling

[Chorus]
Watched my hands curl into fists
Your name just went on my list
I won't say I'm sorry
I won't say I'm sorry
I'm angry all the time, time, time
Angry all the time, time, woah
I'm angry all the time, time, time
Angry all the time, time, woah-woah

[Verse 2]
Don't help me out if you think I'm struggling
'Cause I know you're wondering, you're wondering why
I bleed so blue 'cause I put my heart on ice
More bitter with every bite, with every bite
(You)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trembling, (you, you), I'm trembling
I, not listening, (you, you), I'm trembling

[Chorus]
Watched my hands curl into fists
Your name just went on my list
I won't say I'm sorry
I won't say I'm sorry
I'm angry all the time, time, time
Angry all the time, time, woah
I'm angry all the time, time, time
Angry all the time, time, woah-woah

[Bridge]
I'm explosive, just like a bomb in the boot of your car
I'm acid, I'm corrosive
Let me rot away, rot away
I can't stop this
Just like a bike with the brakes turned off
You know, I keep on rolling
Let me ride away, ride away

[Chorus]
Watched my hands curl into fists
Your name just went on my list
I won't say I'm sorry
I won't say I'm sorry
I'm angry all the time, time, time
Angry all the time, time, woah
I'm angry all the time, time, time
Angry all the time, time, woah-woah
Watched my hands curl into fists
Your name just went on my list
I won't say I'm sorry
I won't say I'm sorry
I'm angry all the time, time, time
Angry all the time, time, woah
I'm angry all the time, time, time
Angry all the time, time, woah-woah

[Intro: Nina Simone]
I ain't got no home, ain't got no shoes
Ain't got no money, ain't got no class
Ain't got no friends, ain't got no schooling
Ain't got no hurt, ain't got no job
Ain't got no money, no place to stay
Ain't got no

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
Programmed inequity, it's in the nervous system
Listen, watch the words, how they twist 'em
Two thirds of the world turned victim
Subtle energy, they capture and block chi
The unseen violence behind the democracy
Some call it hypocrisy, turn freeman into property
And logically justify not treatin' 'em properly
Invisible ink in the constitution
Meant to preserve the institution, unequal distribution
Of wealth, goods and services
Revolvin' door, no floor, just anxiety and nervousness
Trapped in circuses
Herds of us, not understandin' our purposes
When appetites and psychological types
Get caught in the hype, it's tight from morning 'til night
I'm demanding my rights
Women's suffrage then black suffrage
Or Jim Crow, the KKK
American terrorism
Murders and beatings on television
It's in the cells now, you thought that was yesterday?
But the compression stays, trauma still got most afraid
Stuck in the memory, fear gives birth to lethargy
Generations of children in jeopardy
History written in jealousy, scribes full of heresy
Full of barbarians, ch-ch-check out my melody
Musical therapy, reprogram
Africa full of coltan
Coltrane was a cold man
Black genius in a cold land tryna be the whole man
Heal the homeland
Past time for our own land
Where a grown man can be a grown man
The system has benefit for robbery is robbery
You can't run from it, God is a natural monopoly
Divine creator stuck in monotony
Bureaucracy, psyche on poverty
Self-esteem broken like pottery
No more, not me, codename anomaly
Cause there's just no match for the prodigy
Sovereignty, the god in me
Walking university, living cosmology
Without apology

[Hook: Nina Simone]
I've got life
I've got laughs
I've got headaches and toothaches
And bad times too like you, you, you

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]
OK
The more you suppress life the stronger it gets
With death life the longer it gets
I know it’s hard to admit
That you follow some bullshit
Swallow the wrong pill looking for mr bill
Repression, oppression: same thing (same thing)
Fear the shadow that’s the main thing (main thing)
They keep running from
Every action yields an equal and opposite one
Yes that means the consequence comes
Fields of cumbersome back breaking labor
Can’t be healed with just a cummerbund
I was homecoming queen call me number one
Yep that’s another one, now give the drummer some
Tell every mother’s son expression can be far more powerful than a hundred guns
See my Kalashnikov lyrics with the safety off
Now dance around these niggas like Baryshnikov
Street sweeper my words are my keeper
It’s in the ether, now what you trynna tell these preachers, It’s done
It’s done let loose your tongue
Gifted, black and young
Watch these devils run
They knew a change was gonna come
Sinner man  looking for a place to run
Tell the truth in tongues’ enemy reduced by one's
Thousands 2 can put 10,000 in flight
Speak truth to power every 24 hours

[Hook: Nina Simone]
I've got life
I've got laughs
I've got headaches and toothaches
And bad times too like you, you, you

[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill]
(Ay let me tell you)
Imperialism is a form of Jihad
They killed and enslaved millions for gold bullion, in the name of God
The children of mammon called it spiritual famine
Can we examine, how they stole bauxite, rubber, labor, diamonds and platinum?
The building blocks of society and economy, broke humanity to build the colonies
Using reverse psychology to keep us from knowing our quality
No more human tragedy, no more mis-recognition, no more addiction
Let’s accurately diagnose our condition!
Listen:
400 years of the abuse and misuse of religion
Don’t give me another person’s prescription!
I need what I need, my deeds are my deeds
As a man thinketh so is he, Mezanmi!
Take the land back, every child, woman and man back
Reevaluate history, expeditiously
Can’t live my life in apostasy
Emulate the apostrophe hang with S, you can rock with me
I come in love and truth (truth)
Look at what I went through
Now it’s time to acknowledge just what I give you: Life

[Hook: Nina Simone]
I've got life
I've got laughs
I've got headaches and toothaches
And bad times too like you, you, you

[Verse 4: Lauryn Hill]
There’s a whole lotta wrong to be righted, I get excited
I'ma kick this shit off like I’m on Manchester United & my attention is undivided, so you can’t divide and conquer me!
I’m sitting comfortably in a SUV, up in my SUV taking artistic liberties
Making musical history, a lil' acupuncture, structural integration, my meditation, liberating a generation & beyond that, I’m taking the bomb back. I’m splitting atoms for freedom, America needs more FREED men, able to talk right, not prone to GREED men (It’s just not what you need man)
Let your words and deeds line up, master the mind, young king man??, put your signs up, intelligent designs up!, plant your seeds, keep your dimes up, cuz no man knows when the time’s up
It’s elemental like Solomon in the temple, Ark of the Covenant, accountable to a higher government
I’m looking for love (in all the wrong places)
Somebody tell me, where them brothas went, reclaim your wealth, no more giving the enemy help, no more sympathy for the devil, let'em hang himself
Get all the billion Black people out of these bottles, suffer while grown people get coddled, you know the novel

[Hook: Nina Simone]
I've got life
I've got laughs
I've got headaches and toothaches
And bad times too like you, you, you

Ayo Gucci, holler at these niggas man!
Dear White Supremacy,

First of all you are not really that supreme. While throughout history White Supremacy it must be admitted you have achieved some very dominant positions. These positions have been gained mostly through force or some biological agent such as disease that did a lot of the dirty work for you in advance. I mean and anybody can use force on an unarmed populous and anybody can have smallpox. Not judging, just wanted to point out that having a disease that native folks aren't immune to because they've never seen it doesn't make you strategically smart or tactically superior, just kind of sick. And these dominant positions don't really stand up to the test of time that long either. There is nothing about you biologically or physically that denotes an innate mode of supremacy. For that matter there is also nothing about you psychologically, philosophically, cognitively, academically, socially, architecturally, culturally or even financially that signifies a higher position above any other group. And to be diplomatic there is nothing about you that denotes innate inferiority as well. So what you really are is something in the middle. You are regular. White Regularity is congruent to all other forms of regularity i.e. Black, Brown, Etc etc. But in regularity there is room for differences and this is where White Regularity shines! Each group gets the same essential universals. Dance, food, music, etc. and it must be admitted that the White Regularity take on these universal institutions has been unbelievably impressive and a great addition to the total world culture. I mean spaghetti and meatballs, Romeo & Juliet, Coldplay, The Tuxedo, lighter than air travel are all world class additions to the collective bucket but they are no less or more impressive than every other regular groups take on the universals either. And if we really wanted to get analytical every invention is built on inspiration from a previously existing invention so the claim of "The Supreme 1st" to do something is highly debatable and except for a few exceptions, impossible! All things human aren't born from a supreme overlord solely working in isolation.Things are created in collaboration and in tandem with other cultures, knowledge structures and movements and more important, People. I mean if those Muslims didn't catalog all that Greek philosophy for research we might not even know who Plato was. Now whether this collaboration is forced which is seen so much but not exclusively throughout human history does not take away the fact that it is done with the help of somebody else. We are supreme as a spectrum of colors in collaboration. One color does not dominate the other nor can it. Sure Steve Jobs was white. But the guy who built the computer was probably Chinese. And the girl who wrote the programs for the computer is probably from Mumbai. And the raw materials that were used to make it where probably first pulled out of the ground by somebody in South Africa. And if you take this highly collaborated upon piece of high technology to an indigenous tribe in the jungles of Brazil they'd probably use it as a boat paddle. And we can go on and on down or up the rabbit hole all day long and you'll always find a regular somebody relying on the abilities of a just as regular somebody else that another regular somebody doesn't even care about. White Supremacy is a lie white regularists tell to themselves in hopes that they can get a one way ticket to the top and hope we other colors overhear it. Here's the bad news, ain't no top. Here's the good news though, ain't no bottom neither! It's just the regular ole middle where nobody is safe from being influenced by somebody else's extreme regularness. Is your swastika flag printed in Mexico? Did you know the swastika is officially from Asia and the subcontinent? Did you know black people had slaves in Africa too? Did you know in the world your considered a minority too? I mean you call us niggers and beaners but you gotta ship all your former Native American land backwood sourced ginseng to China to get money to support your meth habit. Meth that's made with chemicals produced in India. I mean Hitler hated everything about the Jews expect every possession they had. It's funny how the things you hate so much you have to rely on the most for your survival.And if you wanted to get really ironic and meta about it, White Supremacy has to validate it's on identity based solely on its relationship to other races! I mean now that's what I would call joined at the hip. Without us there is no white supremacy because there would be nothing to supreme over! That sounds so stupid but sometimes the truth is stupid. Stupid like a fox. And no not stupid like a Fox News I mean the real fox. The animal.
In closing white regularity (the race formerly know as white supremacy) I myself on behalf of my own black regularity salute you. Good luck with the northwest front I hear it's beautiful in the spring and probably a strategic death trap if and when Yellowstone finally decides to blow up!

In the studio right now with Ebro, my nigga Rosenberg right here and he know, that me and Vince go way back just like Lebron hairline against somebody. Shit I don't know, I don't really watch basketball but I play with a couple balls, me and Vincent having threesomes, rolling up the weed crumbs.

Don't let them make you believe

[Verse 2]
See that's the magic of racism, it works on itself
We hate each other, screw each other, kill each other
When we can't kill nobody else
See that's the magic of lackin' resources, it works on itself
500 niggas gettin' pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-popped
And North Carolina didn't help
See that's the magic of racism, it works on itself
Niggas hate niggas, hate niggas, hate niggas, hate niggas
Hate niggas, hate niggas, ayy, niggas, ayy, nigga
And I was born in the A, nigga
And my name Ye, nigga, ayy nigga

[Hook]
Don't-don't-don't-don't
Don't-don't-don't
Don't make, make you believe that I'm crazy
I'm not crazy
Don't-don't-don't-don't
Don't-don't-don't
Don't let the media make you believe that I'm
That I'm...

I write this to explain why I’ll be holding back my album, 1989, from the new streaming service, Apple Music. I feel this deserves an explanation because Apple has been and will continue to be one of my best partners in selling music and creating ways for me to connect with my fans. I respect the company and the truly ingenious minds that have created a legacy based on innovation and pushing the right boundaries.

I’m sure you are aware that Apple Music will be offering a free 3 month trial to anyone who signs up for the service. I’m not sure you know that Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months. I find it to be shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company.

This is not about me. Thankfully I am on my fifth album and can support myself, my band, crew, and entire management team by playing live shows. This is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success. This is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt. This is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create, just like the innovators and creators at Apple are pioneering in their field…but will not get paid for a quarter of a year’s worth of plays on his or her songs.

These are not the complaints of a spoiled, petulant child. These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much. We simply do not respect this particular call.

I realize that Apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming. I think that is beautiful progress. We know how astronomically successful Apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists, writers and producers for the 3 month trial period… even if it is free for the fans trying it out.

Three months is a long time to go unpaid, and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing. I say this with love, reverence, and admiration for everything else Apple has done. I hope that soon I can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music. I think this could be the platform that gets it right.

But I say to Apple with all due respect, it’s not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this. We don’t ask you for free iPhones. Please don’t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.

[Verse 1: Shawn]
Lying beside you here in the dark
Feeling your heart beat with mine
Softly you whisper, you're so sincere
How could our love be so blind?
We sailed on together, drifted apart
And here you are by my side now

[Chorus: All]
So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
Open arms

[Verse 2: Wanya]
Living without you, living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you, wanting you near
How much I wanted you home
But now you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay

[Chorus: All]
So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
Open arms

[Chorus] (2x)

[Verse 3: Pepe the King Prawn]
Come on Mr. Santa, if you could
Steamed, baked, or or fried, I'm always good!
I only stole one little heart this year
But it was from a shrimp, who really cares?
It's time to make his list and check it twice
So I hope he likes his seafood naughty and spiced
You got something bad to say about this crustacean?
You'd better clam up 'til after Christmas vacation!

[Bridge: Cee-Lo Green (Miss Piggy)]
Santa, won't you come and get me
(I'm ready for my presents!)
And take me where I'll find my baby?

This is the way that I say that it's gonna be
This is the way that I say it's supposed to be
This is the way that I say that it's gonna be

Let me go, nigga, back up off me
Dog out the cage, cats walk softly
Talk real lightly, scared to bite me
Scared to death to shoot me, scared to fight me

Industry niggas is playing the wrong game
Up in a real nigga face, saying the wrong thang
At the end of the day, what that really mean?
Come on, let this bitch ass nigga flee

He ain't mean no harm, he ain't mean nuttin' by it
It ain't mean no wrong, you's a grown ass man
Let 'em know, dick ain't for ridin'
Dick is for findin' pussy, then hidin'

What is my dick doing in your mouth?
This ain't a pacifier nigga, c'mon, take that out, please
Oh shit bitch, this is how dog get down
Hands in the air whenever dog hit town
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on

Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on

Y'all niggas heard it through the grape vine
What's that? X is back, I'ma take mine, yeah
Name of the game is get in where you fit in, dog
Nigga, I fit in at the beginnin'

Cats living, jumpin' out the window
Where'd money go? Yo, right out the window
Whether it's rock and roll, I lock and load
Shut 'em down, open up shop, oh no, com on

Dick ridin' niggas, stay up in it, where you goin' dog?
Upside your fuckin' head in minute
First you pick the dudes, stick and move
Witness smooth, real simple, stick to the rules

Why you gotta make shit complicated? I hate it
Y'all keep a nigga aggravated
Then rate it, loading up let the hungry eat
911, it's a beast running loose in the streets
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on

Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, come on
Put 'em up, come on, put 'em up, what?

[Intro]
Close your eyes
Rest your head
You are dead

[Verse 1]
Weary soul
Travel safe
Star express
Earth to Earth
Surf the cosmos
Smell the space dust
Find your way home
Went to see a movie show
Found myself an empty row
Thought the show was just alright
Same old Saturday night

Then I made the usual stop
Coffee at the coffee shop
Friendly face nowhere in sight
Same old Saturday night

I really thought the papers I bought
Would help me forget you for a while
Believe me honey, the funnies weren't funny
They didn't even make me smile

How I wish you'd lift the phone
Fun is fun but not alone
Till you let me hold you tight
Same old Saturday night

I really thought that the papers I bought
Would help me forget you for a while
But believe me honey, the funnies weren't funny
They didn't even make me smile
How I wish you'd lift that phone
Fun is fun but not alone
Till you let me hold you tight
Same old Saturday night

Only your face can help me erase
That same old Saturday night

[Intro: Trey Songz]
Woo, listen

'Cause now you got me loving you

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Got me loving you, got me loving
Now you got me loving you, got me loving you

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Got me lovin' on your pretty ass, baby
That's why you my lady
I ain't gon' lie, I fucked 'bout 500 bitches last summer
Ain't none of them like my bae
They ain't gettin' money like bae
No, she ain't no boss like bae
Tired of these fake ass bitches
You should be somewhere with these fake ass niggas
'Cause a real one knows what's real when they see it
Real recognize real when you see it
My ex girl called, told her beat it
And if I make you my girl, I ain't cheatin'
It's my pussy
And it's your dick, and we selfish
And we so rich
Postin' pictures, need to let these bitches know it 'cause you mine (Ooh yeah)

Baby girl, it's just different (Not you)
And I don't know what I'ma do (What I'ma do)
'Cause now you got me loving you
I can't feel my face
Where's this cold, dark place?
This must be the end
Time to shed some skin
The moon brings high tide in
Rotting and wasting away
Transform this decaying flesh
Mumm-Ra the Ever-Living
God give me sight beyond sight

[Intro: The Weeknd]
We wanted the world, baby
That's why we ended how we ended
We chose to live how we live
Well now you found the one, baby
And you ain't tryna see nobody but him
Nobody but him
Ooh, ooh, but I know you well
Ooh, ooh, girl, I know you well

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Tell your man wait inside when I'm pullin' up
Tell your man wait inside when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, pull up on ya, put it on ya
Fuck you in the car, if he looking for you
Seen you with your man and said, “What up to ya”
Like you ain't give me that work
It was California, 5 in the morning
I was plottin' on ya, we was hot as sauna
Tryna pop up on ya
And fuck you good on that purp
We linkin' up gettin' faded, we fell in love and we made it
We only would fuck, never dated
Come get your lady, all this Ice on me she skated
That pussy was good as Crustaceans
I'm in the latest, she ride the D like Mercedes
I might just call her Mercedes
Rockin' Margiela I might just act like a mason
Will tell nobody you my baby
She fell in love with the real
Now she don't fuck with the fakers
Me and her nigga was sharing a home
I'm talking like Clippers and Lakers
And she get the D from her favorite
That pussy got me going crazy
I know that these niggas gon' hate it
But we only trip when we trip to Jamaica
Just tell ‘em

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Tell your man wait inside when I'm pullin' up
Tell your man wait inside when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Pullin' up on that new thang
Mulsanne and my boo thang
And she's-a-dime like Hussein
And we kick shit, Liu Kang
And Chun-Li, is only one me
I'm like Bun B how I screw things
Front stroke, back stroke
I came, you came
And your main nigga ain't fuckin' with me
He ain't fuckin' with me
Tell that nigga go wait inside
When I pull up on you, you coming with me
Talk dirty, you say it's mine
You say it's mine when I'm cuming in it
Broke boys don't deserve pussy
Therefore, you ain't fucking with her
I'mma be there when that nigga get fly
Soon as he slippin, I'm making you mine
Buy you a Rollie to make up for time
And flood it all out to make sure you shine, girl
I never waited in line, girl
Let me just take you to my world
Soon as that nigga stop frontin' on you
You get the D from behind, girl

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Tell your man wait inside when I'm pullin' up
Tell your man wait inside when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up

[Outro: The Weeknd]
Na na na na nah, na na na na nah, na na na na nah
Ooh, ooh
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
This isn't something
I can feel the headache coming
And you ain't saying nothing
No nothing, at least nothing new
You can touch me all you wanna
I ain't gonna try and stop ya
But before you tell your parents
There's something you should know

[Chorus]
It's not nothing, but it's not something
Yeah we had some fun, but it's not something
No it never was

The closer that we get
The more it seems to bore me
You should probably just ignore me
You have to notice I call at night
I don't mean to be cruel , I don't mean to be a bad guy
After this it is the last time
You must have known, you weren't my only girl

[Chorus 2x]

[Chorus]
Serve it up, serve it up, girl, your loving is the bestest
Working up an appetite and baby you're my breakfast
Ooh, oh, you're so delicious
I'll do your dirty dishes
Serve it up, serve it up, I'm coming back for seconds
Working up an appetite and baby, you're my breakfast
Ooh, oh, you're so delicious
I'll never leave the kitchen

[Verse 1]
Girl, girl, don't you keep me waiting
Say you got a situation, but you here now
Oh girl, baby girl, I know you're down
So let me get you out this crowd and we'll get working

[Pre-Chorus]
Go to work on you
'Cause you know I want it, you won't be disappointed
I'm a fool
I just wanna get a little taste, put it right on my plate and serve it up

[Chorus]
Serve it up, serve it up, girl, your loving is the bestest
Working up an appetite and baby you're my breakfast
Ooh, oh, you're so delicious
I'll do your dirty dishes
Serve it up, serve it up, I'm coming back for seconds
Working up an appetite and baby, you're my breakfast
Ooh, oh, you're so delicious
I'll never leave the kitchen

[Verse 2]
Girl, girl, I know that you know that it's only a matter of time
'Til I do what I do and I make you mine
Girl, got me kissing all on your spot, going hard like your body was my job
Tick, tick, tock, like I'm punching on the clock

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll work on you
'Cause you know I want it, you won't be disappointed
I'm a fool
I just wanna get a little taste, put it right on my face and serve it up

[Chorus]
Serve it up, serve it up, girl, your loving is the bestest
Working up an appetite and baby you're my breakfast
Ooh, oh, you're so delicious
I'll do your dirty dishes
Serve it up, serve it up, I'm coming back for seconds
Working up an appetite and baby, you're my breakfast
Ooh, oh, you're so delicious
I'll never leave the kitchen

[Bridge]
You got that body, you got that body, wanna please it
You got that body, you got that body, and I need it
Girl, I've been waiting all damn day
Come on and put it on my plate

[Chorus]
Serve it up, serve it up, girl, your loving is the bestest
Working up an appetite and baby you're my breakfast
Ooh, oh, you're so delicious
I'll do your dirty dishes
Serve it up, serve it up, I'm coming back for seconds
Working up an appetite and baby, you're my breakfast
Ooh, oh, you're so delicious

[Intro: Gucci Mane & Young Thug]
Nigga, turn up

Trap house mansion
Yeah, right on Flat Shoals Exit, nigga
We got London on da Track

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm pourin' fours and shit, I need to just put a deuce in
Car cost four-hundred-thou' and I put a roof in
My nigga pot cook it so good he put his shoe in it
Nigga, it's a gangsta party, why fuck is you in it?
Head bust a microwave, shit, didn't take him two minutes
You know that there's some straps in the club, they let my crew in
I might just do the Michael Vick man and cook it left hand
If you ain't talkin' 'bout buyin' grams then I'm a deaf man
I can make the dope do numbers, the Stacey Augmon
I told my bitch to dye her hair red like Dennis Rodman
If Gucci Mane got so much money then why he robbin'?
We thirty deep, we cover the streets, nigga, we mobbin'

[Chorus: Young Thug]
(It's Guwop), again
Thugger and Guwop, again
Chasin' that guap, again

Pay if you owe me baby, go 'head and show me baby
Pull up and pour it

I got gold on my Rollie
And I'm real right like a poet
I look like a dope boy, I know it
I know I'm gonna win it like Floyd
I became an important lil' boy
Money long like a sock with some shorts

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
My bitch white and she brown like a port
Ed-umacation abort, bookin' these dorks
I jumped off the porch and went north
Whipped you some dope full of narc-cotics
YSL hardbody, I got 'bout twenty chickens in the lobby, baby
Ride it, ride it Kawasaki, 'saki
I don't speak english
I fuck that mouth, when I see her
I'm the big homie, I'm leakin'
Stick to the streets like I'm cement
I don't need no change, you can keep it
I don't want your verse on my remix
No panties she my secret
Got a hunnid bands on me I'm cheesin'
This the sequel, lookin' down like an eagle

[Chorus: Young Thug]
(It's Guwop), again
Thugger and Guwop, again
Chasin' that guap, again

Eyes red on high, 30 racks off in my pocket
Swear to God no lie
Disrespect my best friend, I promise you will die
See me in the vip, I'm kushy to the sky
Hopped out, I'm fresh as fuck, the rollie on my wrist
Tatted on my neck and arm, damn I'm the shit
Damn I'm the king, bring the toilets when I shit

Froze out lookin like a motherfuckin eschimo
Sod money gang, we blew up like geronimo

[Verse 3:]

Throw em at the bentley coupe
Fuck hard top, I knock out the roof, rollie
Drop top lamborghini, you can see the proof

Riding through the hood, I'm beefin motherfucker truths
He say he poured up, bitch pour douce
Soulja boy tell em God damn, I'm the truths
Rock this rolex!

[Intro]
I'm a young, 24 year old nigga
I come to take this game and bring it to me
We gon' be here
Ain't no fly by night nigga
We gon' be here two years, three years
I got this shit

[Verse]
Wire taps, y'all some grown liars
I'm Julius with Cleo betting on my empire
I'm busy in the jet, like a Spitfire
Grandiose in the house, looking like Granada
I'm pops to your daughter's daughter
Want my head like Pompeii, the Roman rider
I write you off like a speed infraction
I'm through with all the talking
Your misery got bad company
Fuck all y'all been
It's LK, symbolic
All the shit I embody
You might get shot but Johnny's driving nice cars
Tryna park it, don't you holla if it ain't my Gualla
Growing up where I'm from, iPhone to get you towed on
Located in bankroll, my niggas weight the dome
The shit I've waited for ever since Brenda Song
Told you that I'd make-make it home, motherfuckers
This ain't no ball game, mad ruckus
More like the Rucker, more like Christchurch, mother
Teresa cash, credit and visas
Not the car, but the passport feature
Need the passport if you're riding with the asshole
Tell her no bags, we shopping on tour, freak
We make a nice cold week and if you ass caught creeping
I'm balanced on the poppers, if I stop won't tell who dropping
I'm topic of discussion when it's who young with the money
I'm here, motherfuckers
I hear my name from the bleachers
But I'm too busy reaching
Looking up to deceased kings
Long live the last king, Martin had a dream

[Outro]
And it's me
Busy in the jet like a spitfire
Julius built my empire
Y'all some grown liars
Y'all some grown liars
Busy in the jet like a spitfire
Julius built my empire
Y'all some grown liars
Y'all some grown liars

[Verse 1]
Old fucking drama, call the karma kamikaze
Shots of alcohol the pain its relic in my chest, I feel demolished
Hold the liquor, make it silence, pray into me like the altar
Life is off the loss and coughing I'm just here to make my offer
Crystal sniffing, bitches tripping, luxury and gang members
Wanna be like Boyz N Hood, affiliated by my brothers
Worship higher powers, smokes inpolished, drinking from the chalice
So they say it's his blood be like he was a Jesús
I'm holy, horrors making eye contact
Surviving the thrones, stones at yo front door, bang it though
When a nigga get dough, promise I pay you back mo'
You always had my back and I thank you for that
Wanna call you late, but I'm busy filling plates
Kids gotta eat and mommas gon' cry, that bread been straight, we shaking dank
Baby I'ma save you one day, from this hell hole and gunplay
Grew up with cinco hasta las cinco
Went east side where rain poured and souls cried, no sunshine
Tomorrow when tears dry, no one'll make it out alive
I just wanna make it God, can you hear me fine, here been deaf, feeling blind, all I see is sacrifice (overtime)
Show no remorse when you die, until then
Wash my sins with time, make yo bed (lay on the line)
Looking at headlines, it's all alive on who are you and I to decide, just tryna get by
And that's pure like virgin blood mixed with 1-51 one sip
Make a nigga flip, I ain't tripping off shit
That happened yesterday, cause I just wanna rest today in pure luxury

[Hook]
All my life I wanted luxury
A roof over to sleep
Family, that's luxury
All I ever hung around was G's
Breaking bread with the homies, that's luxury
Something like virgin blood that's pure and she screaming out "Its yours"
All I ever wanted was luxury
Now all I got is luxury, come fuck with me

[Verse 2]
20 bandana, cross my fingers when in danger
I protect you perfect stranger, put that body on a hanger
Her man's in Herman, 

[?] don't need a fucking filla
Hold my hand, your halo's fading, pesos and Pinot Grigio
Bless the newborns, my comrades they die for me
It's not the game, you just a casualty
War ruins who after me
Surviving, could have been a tragedy
Ninth grade, in a driver seat
Skipping class, no time to speak
Truth be told this honesty
Poker face and poke her highness next to me
I'm soaking royal altercationally
Not complacent, want the cake and cream
Settle in, you just another loyal fee
I don't smoke that reggie seed, high at the presidential suite
And I ain't at the legion seat nigga, overseas
With Sheikhs that's royalty nigga
You can bet that, my tux black
My bitch black and I'm backing out
That ghost black, black MX
Ain't gotta say shit, on the favor

[Hook]
All my life I wanted luxury
A roof over to sleep
Family, that's luxury
All I ever hung around was g's
Breaking bread with the homies, that's luxury
Something like virgin blood that's pure and she screaming out "its yours"
All I ever wanted was luxury
Now all I got is luxury, come fuck with me

[Spoken Outro]
When it all started a couple of months ago
I found that all of my friends were doing it
And I didn't want to feel left out
So, I went out and got one, and it's true what they say
"You'll never forget the first time"
When I put that big face Rollie,
It felt like pure luxury

[Verse 2: Tyga]
I met some models, they said life full of obstacles
Challenges and mobster rules and Libyan size pools
Hold my breath and take 2, anxieties and robberies
Survival, threats, apologies, I made it through the poverty
I be... on my own shit
Cause you never, never know when somebody gon' trip
Oh shit, miss a nigga with that bullshit, man
Aye bossman, I'm my own bossman, understand?

[Hook]
Why blood wanna take mine?
Tell cuz won't take mine

Gotta make a way for my bloodline
So make way, nigga, in due time
Paid dues and I'm due mine

So make way, nigga, in due time
Paid dues and I'm due mine
Tryna make way for my bloodline
Stained blood through my bloodline

[Verse 1]
They said it's racist, black on black faces
Can't portray a nigga when you're called it daily
Days I've dreamt, defeated diplomatic immunity
Ain't shit safe, livin' in a gated community
I put miles on this hooptie, my heroine's tookie
Never seen real life like a gangster movie
Though we kept that Uzi, black gators, we're movin'
Like pharaohs in tombs, bitch, I'm back in tune, bitch
Black out the room, we birthed into this
Who is this new nigga? Who is the proven?
Hundred percent real, no silicone music
I don't do it for you niggas, I just do it to do it
Years ago I swear I was Prince Zamunda
Now I'm King T Ruler
Never know when you're winnin' 'til you start losin'
Can't lose it

Have not betrayed your ideals
Your ideals betrayed you

[Verse 2]
I'm King Ramses of my era
Pacin' everlastin' love, couldn't take me this far
But still my heart racin' to new life and past relations
I'm on deck, Last King, standin' formation
Take a look at your life 'fore you judge mine
Middle finger high, fuck a peace sign
Please give me somethin' to write about, it's been too long
23 years behind bars, no father, shoulder to lean on
No love lost, just cold found
I just... wanna see wealth and my family smile
Wanna pass a better generation down
Cosigned since a child, let him make his way down
A man who they praise now, gon' kneel down, say a prayer loud
I'm here, niggas actin' like I had invitations
Like a nigga just slept, woke up in a mansion and shit
Like a nigga in the club all night dancin' and shit
Like the Jamie Foxx Show, bitches actin' fancy and shit
Shit... if I could I would, my nigga
Right now I'm just focused, livin' good, my nigga
All that shit on TV lookin' good, my nigga
Shit, you doin' your thing, as you should, my nigga
As you should, my nigga

[Outro]
Keep doin' your thing
I see you
Just take it day by day
Can't take this shit when you leave
Only thing you leave behind is your bloodline
Keep doin' your thing, my nigga
As you should, my nigga
As you should, my nigga

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Looking at myself, I see the man, nigga
I'mma call it like I say it, I'mma call you bitch made nigga
Holding pistols not to entertain niggas
I got held up at the light reaching for my switchblade, nigga
Popeye’s on his spinach with the gauge, nigga
If I tell you that the babysitter's dead, don't play, nigga
Reach inside your pockets, dial H, nigga
If you need help with pressure, don't drive this way, nigga
You know I got schizophrenic tendencies
I dream of porn stars and pouring gas on my enemies
If I get a check, I'm not the vet
I'm a dawg ass nigga looking for a hump bitch

[Hook 1]
Shaka Zulu with the new do with the TEC
This is not a purchase, everyday life shit
I've been praying for your downfall, man
But all I see is bad bitches coming down the hill, damn
Shaka Zulu noodle and the TEC
Don't tell anybody that the babysitter's dead
And I heard it from a birdie, it was dead
How'd they bring you back to life? That's a star resurrect

[Verse 2]
She bowed to her knees, want forgiveness
But all I could think about was coming out of speakers
She a fun girl living on the edge
Poppa ran a hedge fund, all his daughter do is give head
Said he had it up to head and neck
Don't you point the thing at me, it could go off offside your head
Temple to the brain, now he dead
That's a life learned lesson, never stress over bullshit
Wasn't even her why he did it
But he found his wife with his daughter's boyfriend, nigga damn
That's some fucked shit over sex
These bitches overrated and I judge 'em like "who next?"

[Hook 2]
Temple to the brain from the TEC
Don't you tell anybody that the babysitter's dead
And I heard it from a birdie, he was dead
How'd they bring you back to life? That's a star resurrect, nigga
Shaka Zulu noodle and a TEC (and a TEC)
Don't you tell anybody that the babysitter's dead
And I heard it from a birdie, he was dead (he was dead)
How'd they bring you back to life? That's a star resurrect, nigga

[Verse 3]
Six weeks, had to vacay
Ain't a resident in sight, just a beach, making sex tapes
Sure, say the shit to my face
She gon' get me off, nigga, like bug spray
Bitches all fake and fanatics, causing ruckus with a ratchet
Don't you put that on your loved ones, you are not my level pattern
This is Pacquiao and pack it, peddle faster like a Flintstone
On a roll, full of ashes, we just run you, this the legion
Zulu, it's all gone, Zulu, forever perished
Ten bedrooms in the palace
But your Playboy bunny's ears full of carrots, I told y'all

[Hook 3]
Shaka Zulu noodle with a TEC
Don't you tell anybody that the babysitter's dead
And I heard it from a birdie, you was dead
How'd they bring you back to life? That's a star resurrect, nigga
Temple to the brain from the TEC
Don't you tell anybody that the babysitter's dead
And I heard it from a birdie, you was dead
How'd they bring you back to life? That's a star resurrect, nigga
Temple to the brain from the TEC
I go temple to the brain from the TEC
Don't you tell anybody that the babysitter's dead, nigga

[Verse 4/Bridge]
Glory be, lord to be
Fashion so fucking unorderly
Move accordingly, don't order me
You poorer than me, more can afford the fee
Word to Meek, 100 in the dungarees
Who claim the game, we're young living like Meek
Click on the tee, Lord of Rings, you order me
Theatric fairytale's become extinct
Fuck the peace, I put a piece on my neck
'Bout the size of a Complex magazine
I'm not for sale, I bought your dreams
Leonardo DaVinci, the Bentley boost my self-esteem
Bitches cling like the chain already been doing the same thing
I mean this gold for press, G
I'm tryna bob and weave, why you chasing me?
I'm on my victory lap, can't you see?

[Outro]
Temple to the brain from the TEC
Don't you tell anybody that the babysitter's dead, nigga
I go temple to the brain from the TEC
Don't you tell anybody that the babysitter's dead, nigga

You know it's all love, heart attack, heart attack
I told the money where my heart at, no comin' back, shit
And niggas take that money ooh, no, shit
Niggas take that money ooh (I know I did)
And now I'm formed with no assist
Spend the gain with my main chick
Comin' down in that lane switch
Stuntin' now on these lame niggas
What the fuck ya name is, don't care what ya name is
Nooo, I don't

I ain't the same rock (Same rock)
I ain't the same now (Same now)

I'm like fuck that, I love you (I love you, yeah)
And fuck that, I need you (I need you)
I took you 'round the globe and back
Matter fact, to Rome and back, I could tell you need that (Need that)

[Hook 4]
'Cause baby, you've been down for a minute
And you've been tryna make your way home
Baby, you've been down for a minute
Your way home, your way home (Home)
You've been rollin' with 'em hitters
And you didn't got way, way, way strong
And now they wanna rob you, she wanna rob me
But we be on our way home

[Outro]
Ahh-ahh
Whenever you get lost
Just remember I will always be there to guide you
Listen to the sound of my voice
My, my love will always be your light
Darkness will always follow the brightest star
(The brightest star)
Our dreams are what make us who we are
The world's yours, Tyga

[Intro]
Hit the bitch
I know you feel special

[Verse 1]
Look me in the eyes, I ain't ever lie
Real killa bees, Wu-Tang 'bout this West Side
Dominate, make a bitch woosah, head nod
Never been fake, gettin' pussy on the red dot
Red dots, pointin' at the bullseye
Lookin' at moi, it's a thin line
Got Bobby Brown for a widow, Superman high
Who gon' contest I? Light up the Jedi
Came with the booty and some caine, purple on the dank
Drippin' my new paint, days, 50 days
Yes I'll be late, I need dollars andale-le-le
Andale, all white, Lana Del Rey
Video games, fuckin', my life, gotta love it
Nothin' above it
Angels and Rolex, a ho fast in public
I don't shop at Publix
Pussy with chopsticks, I dug it, I dug it
I'm sober until 10
If she open, I lock it and post bail
I'ma need the helipad when I land
If it's not there, we back to the crib
That Maybach my limo
So you wanna bang, my nigga?
Got a piece that'll bang, my nigga
Let's bang, my nigga
When I finish, take all your bitches
Now she tellin' me all your business

[Hook]
I hit the bitch with the wham
Wham, wham
Pose like that, just like that
Just like that
That bitch give me wham
Wham, wham
Tattooed that, bring that shit
Pose like that
That bitch give me wham

[Verse 2]
Wham, fuck up the bed
Hole in her neck from the fangs
Pressure and pain, adjust the brains
Rove to the Lamb', my engine the same
Asylum restrained, this ain't for playin'
Put on the mask, now I'm Zoro on the dash
They don't make 'em like this anymore, goddamn
I'm pullin' up, you would think my first name Dan
Niggas like damn, load up the pain, no blanks
Got hate, do a stain, pallbearer liftin' dead weight
How much you weigh?
On a scale... ...to 98
Keep it one hundred with me like sand on the beach
Need a freak of the week
That's her sister Anise, keep it G
On some real shit, niggas can't fuck with me
They can't fuck with me
Wham, wham, more than a man
Who got the keys to the Lamb'
Pussy and cash, hundreds and ass
Pulled out my stash, niggas got mad
Mad, damn, drunk when I land
Fresh off the plan, T-Raw the ram, ram
Look me in the eyes, I ain't ever lie

[Hook]
I hit the bitch with the wham
Wham, wham
Pose like that, just like that
Just like that
That bitch give me wham
Wham, wham
Tattooed that, bring that shit
Pose like that
That bitch give me wham
Wham, wham
Pose like that, just like that
Just like that
That bitch give me wham
Wham, wham
Tattooed that, bring that shit
Pose like that
That bitch give me wham

[Outro]
(Wham)
You now listenin' to the sounds of T-Y-G, if you don't like what you hear, sit back and shut the fuck up. Oh yeah, and have a nice day

[Verse 1]
You know it’s only good pussy that I'm used to
Now this good dick only thing you used to
Anything less couldn't hear her with a bluetooth
Laced up, tongue out, stuntin’, actin’ brand new
They ain’t even know you was steppin’ in Giuseppe too
37 spare bright jeans 'bout 12 jewels
Posin’ like a mannequin, bag, matching manicure
Two ill shawites in the van, she heaven sent
Ever since you was little had a silver spoon
How they make it hard for you shoulda made a song for you
And the world is your stage, turn on the lights for you
Lighting up one in the crowd I be rootin’ for you
If it don't go well, well I'm still rootin' for you
Lean on me if you need help, I'm a tutor to you
Put me in the cell, hit a nigga when you ready to
Better when its late night I'mma just drive through

[Hook]
I know its hard for you
Do it too well, I don't wanna see you fail
They just try and make it hard for you
I know its hard for you
Even though you a star to ‘em
Everybody need love just pick up the phone and imma come through
And make it hard for you

[Verse 2]
And you know the summer’s mine, fuck with a winner
Had to show you shit they ain’t really wanna show you
Imma put you on game, run game on these other bitches
Told her never show no love for a bitch nigga
Keep it all business if you fuckin’ with em
Never let your guard down even when the stars ‘round
Get a lover baby if you in it for the long haul
If you pacing I can show your ass how to last long
I don’t wanna see you up in every video
Every year all star cities I go
If there’s money to be made I can understand
But don't fuck up your brand for a grand, you understand?
Somewhere in Miami gettin’ all tan
With a flock of all tens, talkin' bout who they fuckin’
Ducks swim together baby just remember that
You got too much potential to lose so get rid of that

[Hook]
I know it’s hard for you
You do it too well, I don't wanna see you fail
They just try and make it hard for you
Well me, I just fall for you
Even though I'm a star to you
Everybody need love just pick up the phone and I’ll come through
And make it hard for you

[Verse 3]
Spendin’ all your time on the internet
Checkin up your wish list, things that you wanna get
Make a nigga pay for it, they ain't gotta wait for it
They just wanna fly you out, maybe bring a friend for ‘em
I can tell you over that, been through hell and back
Fuckin’ with the wrong one, you ain’t try to double back
Time to find some love for that, lay up and cuddle that
In the club gettin’ on, rather chill in bubble bath, parlayin'
And i know i ain't saying much
But you gotta learn to give trust
Even when it’s no trust, you gotta find some
Being young on your own it’s like the world against ya
I can bet I could preach that
Appreciate what I do for that
It’s more what I came from if you cater back
Lemme guide you, get inside you, style you
Is what I'm getting at

[Hook]
It’s hard for you
It’s too easy if it’s all for you
Anything that can ball for you
Don't wanna make it hard for you
When the sun rise, you be right there
Still shining like a star to ‘em
Everybody need love just pick up the phone, I’ll come through
And make it hard for you

[Intro]
Stand back, god talk
The watch cost

[Verse 1]
First things first I pop, sling all the honeys
Ain't it funny? Angel, I got devils wanting money
Seems sacred but get nathin'
My penetration is all revelations
And my eyes only seeing basic, they foul flagrant
Infatuated with the bracelets, diamond-cut player
You fallacious, not complacent
Competition, I'm your favourite, knock knock
It's me, motherfucker, you're dead wrong
Turning your doorknob, a heartthrob
Never my title but you bitches getting robbed
I rhyme and flip lines so far ahead of my time
My punchlines is lemon lime
I'm sour, nigga, sweeter than pine
I'm God's gift like Christmas time
The money Jewish but it's black on black crimes
They box me in from time to time
For a Rolex, is you willing to die? You willing to die, nigga?
Oh shit, nigga, you a rich nigga?
Does your wrist glitter? How much your car engine?
I can tell you got six figures
Figure you ain't no real nigga
You don't struggle like real niggas
Probably snitch on a real nigga
Just to get you out of bed, nigga
Well let's see, my god is your god
If he got faith in me, go and pull the trigger
And leave it be, nigga
Russian roulette, let's make a bet
100 on black, I'm back with a vengeance, the villain is vicious
Heart of gold is relentless, book of Genesis
Don't eat the apple, but you'd rather live ravish
Street savvy, but not wealthy
Good health, be blessed, tryna reach the heavens
One day as I pray, halo over me
As I lay back, chick on my lap everyday, this god talk

[Hook]

[?]
This god talk

[?]
This god talk

[?]
Let god talk

[?]
Stand back lil nigga, let God talk

[Verse 2]
Tryna follow Christ, but this club light super bright
And they pay me cash every single night
Taking models back to the crib
I know you want my life, you don't want my life
Couldn't handle what they write about you
The Superman of height, you can get 'em high
But how far is you willing to climb for your own shine?
Blowing shine, papers let a nigga vibe, letting God talk
I'm like when summer approach
Niggas thinking they're good, but they're more TO
I'm known coast to coast, you tryna play god
With the devil's robes
It's only one god, boy, you far from close
Been ready, change cars like winter coats
Niggas bubblegum, Winterfresh, in they Easter clothes
No lint on my Easter clothes
Resurrect, the prophet spoke

[Hook]

[?]
This god talk

[?]
This god talk

Let god talk

[?]
God talk

[Outro]
And the Lord he told me find my way home
And the Lord he told me find my way home
And the Lord he told me make me home
And the Lord he told me find my way home

Believe in yourself and the rest will fall in place, have faith in your own abilities. Work hard and it's nothing you can't accomplish

[Intro]
I can't make you love me

[Verse 1]
Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me and tell me no lies
Just hold me close and don't patronize
Don't patronize me

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something that it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart 'til I feel the power
But you won't, no, you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't

[Verse 2]
I'll close my eyes then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come and I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart 'til I feel the power
But you won't, no, you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't

[Bridge]
Just let me hold you baby one more time
And maybe tonight I can change your mind
And make you love me like you did before
Leave a feeling in your heart you can't ignore
I feel that baby we can make this right
If you just give me one more night
I think that we're worth it and I feel we deserve it
If you feel that we don't have a chance

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something that it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart 'til I feel the power
But you won't, no, you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Born with it, born with it
Yellow bitch fat ass and she was born with it
Tote that scrap my nigga like I was born with it
And that pussy so good I nutted already
Born with it, born with it
She ride my dick, my nigga like she was born with it
Keep them bands on me like I was born with it
Got 2 mill on me right now like born with it

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
20 chains on, I done made a entrance
Tryna rush the stage should've brought a fence in
Said they seen a brick with muhfuckin' imprint
Man I ball so hard last night I damn near had an injury
Smoking blunts of cookie in the Bentley
Cookie in the Bentley, cookie in the Bentley
Smoke, smoking blunts of cookie in the Bentley
Cookie in the Bentley, cookie in the Bentley

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Born with it, born with it
Yellow bitch fat ass and she was born with it
Tote that strap young nigga like I was born with it
And that pussy so good I nutted already
Born with it, born with it
She ride my dick, my nigga like I was born with it
Keep them bands on me like I was born with it
Got 2 mill on me right now like born with it

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Just look at my ring, diamonds in my chain
Me and Guwop pull up fire flame
These rapper niggas lame
They never took the rest and took em on a plane
Blowing Mary Jane
I'm on a private jet, I just got a check
Riding round in a Rari, jumped off in a vet
Man the rap game hurting, heard that its a joke
Pull up in the U-Haul with 2 thousand pints
Pouring up the lean yeah I'm pouring up the act
Shout out to my young nigga, cause all we do is trap
Just me and Guwop, pulling up in that Jag
If you niggas get to talking, put the choppas on they ass

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Born with it, born with it
Yellow bitch fat ass and she was born with it
Tote that strap young nigga like I was born with it
And that pussy so good I nutted already
Born with it, born with it
She ride my dick, my nigga like I was born with it
Keep them bands on me like I was born with it
Got 2 mill on me right now like born with it

[Verse 1: Wanya Morris]
Lying in my bed
I hear a clock ticking and I think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashbacks, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories

Time after

Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling out to me
And I can't hear what you say
You say go slow
Now I'm far behind
The second hand unwinds

[Chorus]
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall
I will catch you
I'll be waiting, yeah
Time affter time
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall
I will catch you
I'll be waiting, oh
Time after time

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman]
After my pictures fades
And darkness has turned to grey
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen
From deep inside
The drum beats out of time

[Chorus]
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time

[Nathan Morris]
You said go slow
And I'm far behind
The second hand unwinds

[Chorus]
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time
Oh, time after time
Time after time, yeah
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time

[Verse 1]
Every time our eyes meet
This feeling inside me
Is almost more than I can take
Baby, when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I've never been this close
To anyone or anything
I can hear you thoughts
I can see your dreams and I

[Chorus]
I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
And it just keeps getting better, yeah
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you

[Verse 2]
The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
(And you say you love me)
Your hair all around me
Baby, you surround me
You touch every place in my heart

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, it feels like our first time every time
I wanna spend the whole night in your eyes

[Chorus]
I don't know how you do it
I'm so in love with you
And it just keeps getting better, better, oh I
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you

[Bridge]
Feels like I am so...
I am so amazed by your love
It feels like forever inside
It's almost more than I can spend
And I can't control it, no

[Chorus]
I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
And it just keeps getting better, oh I
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever (forever) and ever (and ever)
And ever, baby (oh)
Every thing you do
Baby, everything you do
I'm amazed by you
If you leave me now
You'll take away the biggest part of me
Ooh no, baby, please don't go

If you leave me now
You'll take away the very heart of me
Ooh no, baby, please don't go
Ooh no, I just want you to stay

Ooh, a love like ours is love that's hard to find
Ooh, how could you let it slip away?
We've come too far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way?

When tomorrow comes then we'll both regret
The way we feel today

If you leave me now
You'll take away the biggest part of me
Ooh no, no, baby, please don't go
'Cause I want you to, please stay baby
A love like ours is love that's hard to find
How could you let it slip away?
We've come too far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way?

When tomorrow comes we'll both regret
The things we said today

If you leave me now
You, you'll take away the biggest part of me
Ooh no, baby, please don't go
Ooh no, just want you to stay

Ooh no, baby, please don't go
Ooh no, baby, please don't go
Oh mama, I just got to have your lovin', yeah
Ooh no, baby, we've come too far to leave it all behind

[Verse 1]
And I'd give up forever to touch you
Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now

And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
Cause sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you tonight

[Chorus]
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

[Verse 2]
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything seems like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive

[Chorus]
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

[Bridge]
Oh hey, don't wanna be all alone, no
Yeah, said I don't wanna be
Don't wanna be left here on my own
No one knows me quite the way you know me
And I'd be lonely without you beside me
Please believe me
You're the closest, the closest, baby
To heaven that I'd ever be

[Chorus]
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am

[Outro]
Yeah, who I am...

[Verse 1]
I can feel your heart around me
Can you feel it all 'round you?
Nothing in this world I know
Can you tell me who you are?

[Verse 2]
Fantasy of life all around
Way too real, how it feels
I'll ask the Lord to keep my soul
Lay my head down to rest

[Verse 3]
Where the giants roam
Down in your mind
Somewhere between space and time
Watching, waiting for their time

[Chorus]
You are the one, so why stop it?
You are the one that calls me papi
You are the one, good and naughty
Baby, you're the one, hey
You are the one, so why stop it?
You are the one that calls me papi
You were born a star
But now you're my midnight moon
And my morning sun

[Verse 1]
I thought that this love affair
Would only last one night
It turns out that this feeling
I want rest of my life
I wake up holding on to you
Every night, you do something
Didn't know you could do
Yeah, and I got the feeling
Ooh, yeah, I got the feeling

[Chorus]
You are the one, so why stop it?
You are the one that calls me papi
You are the one, good and naughty
Baby, you're the one, hey
You are the one, so why stop it?
You are the one that calls me papi
You're the only one
The only one, the only one, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
You're the only one, the only one, the only one
You were born a star
But now you're my midnight moon and my morning sun
You're the only one, the only one, the only one
You were born a star
But now you're my midnight moon and my morning sun

[Verse 2]
You got everything I want
In all the right places
Twenty different smiles
And twenty more when you're naked
I wake up smiling next to you
Every night, you do something
Didn't know you could do
Yeah, and I got the feeling
Ooh, yeah, I got the feeling

[Chorus]
You are the one, so why stop it?
You are the one that calls me papi
You are the one, good and naughty
Baby, you're the one, hey
You are the one, so why stop it?
You are the one that calls me papi
You're the only one
The only one, the only one, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
You're the only one, the only one, the only one
You were born a star
But now you're my midnight moon and my morning sun
You're the only one, the only one, the only one
You were born a star
But now you're my midnight moon and my morning sun

[Outro]
My morning sun
My morning sun
My morning sun, ooh
My morning sun
My morning sun...

[Pre-Chorus: Future & Meek Mill]
I just took a Perc', now I'm on another level
Tastin' on the molly got me dancin' with the devil
Poured a eighth of Kobe Bryant, mixin' purple with the yellow
Got these racks on me, now it's hard to keep this shit together (Woo, woo)

[Chorus: Future & Meek Mill]
Jump out the 'Rari ,then jump out a Wraith
Then I hop in Margiela, then hop in some Bape (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, woo, woo)
They jump out the face, they jump out the face
Money gon' stack and this money gon' fall though, Meek Mill

[Verse 1: Meek Mill & Future]
Came from the hood, now we jump out of states (The states)
Peep all these diamonds, they jump out the face (They do)
Duckin' indictments and sellin' this white (Ah)
Got to watch for these niggas, they'll jump on your case
(You watch out, these niggas, these niggas, they playin')
And none of this money don't come out the safe (You know what I'm sayin'?)
Fuck with my dawg, knock a chunk out ya face (Ayy, blatt, blatt)
Nigga I be so high, I could jump out to space
What the fuck did I say? (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Future]
I be so fly, just don't shoot my cape (Woo)
Went and bought me a safe and it came with a Wraith (Woo)
Got some new money, went, bought me a K (Yeah)
You see all them VV's jump out the face (The VV)
Put that dope in the trap and cook up me a cake (Strip club)
We fly to Cuba to fuck up some mula (Freebandz)
Pour up some pour up, my nigga we boolin' (Freebandz)
Young nigga pull up in Bentleys just boolin'
I'm taking your ho from you cause she was choosy (Skrrt)

Get me a truck of them things, I'll move it
VVS cuts on my wrist suicidal ('Cidal)

I spend it all with my niggas, let's get it (Let's get it)
Get out your feelings, young nigga let's get it
I got stars on my ceiling

[Chorus: Future & Meek Mill]
Jump out the 'Rari (Ah), then jump out a Wraith (Woo)
Then I hop in Margiela, then hop in some Bape (Ha, ha, ha, woo, woo, woo, skrrt, skrrt, Meek, woo)
They jump out the face (Straight up, woo, freaky fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh)
They jump out the face
Money gon' stack and this money gon' fall though, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I've been peepin', you niggas been watchin' my moves
Watchin' my stacks and my shoes
When everybody did the Gucci and Louis
We was on Jimmy Choos
2012, when we did the Giuseppes
Margielas was cool
When you lil' niggas was worried about Jordans
We was rocking them Loubs
If I got to lose, it's not by the rules
Get hit with that chopper, knock right out your shoes
Shawty so proper, she look like a goddess
When I dip inside her, it's just like a pool
I bought some 'Raris and I bought some Phantoms
And then dropped out the seat like I dropped out of school
Still will pull up on you, hop out with goons
Thirty-two shots, let it pop out the tool

[Pre-Chorus: Future]
I just took a Perc', now I'm on another level
Tastin' on the molly got me dancin', with the devil
Poured a eighth of Kobe Bryant, mixin' purple with the yellow
Got these racks on me, now it's hard to keep this shit together

[Chorus: Future & Meek Mill]
Jump out the 'Rari (Ah), then jump out a Wraith (Woo)
Then I hop in Margiela, then hop in some Bape (Ha, ha, ha, woo, woo, woo, skrrt, skrrt, Meek, woo)
They jump out the face (Straight up, woo, freaky fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh)
They jump out the face
Money gon' stack and this money gon' fall though, yeah, yeah, woah

[Verse 1]
Rather eat crumbs with bums 'fore I split my steak with you snake ass niggas
I rather stay down with my day ones 'fore I come around you fake ass niggas
I rather have a broke real bitch 'fore I ever deal with y'all fake ass bitches
And I ain't with the flooding on the 'gram I don't really fuck with you, don't take my picture nigga
Posted on the corner with a 40 on my hip, Godzilla
We was getting to it when they hit my nigga Dean, that's when shit got realer
I was on the Southside really outside got guns got killers
Started from the bottom of the bottom now its bottles popping in the sky villa
Catch a body, be about it
I'm from where you couldn't talk you ain't be about it
I ain't really with the talkin', let's be G about it
When we catch you niggas slipping we gon' see about it
And these niggas get to talking like they know me
Finna turn me to the old me
Should've listened to my momma when she told me
Now these bitches throwing pussy cause they owe me

[Chorus]
I got the juice, nigga I got the juice
Nigga I got the juice when I hop out the coupe
When I hop out the coupe
Real niggas I'mma salute
Cause I got the juice, I got the juice
Nigga I got the juice, she popping pussy
Like I'm Uncle Luke
Cause I got the juice

[Verse 2]
Counting million dollars gon' fuck something
Put an eight up in my Phantom I don't want none
Nigga looking I don't tuck nothing
My nigga Ernie got thirty trying to slump something
I make the call to Arizona and the truck coming
Yeah, Papi, come dump somethin'
Bust them up we don't tuck nothing
Take a bird to the table we don't front nothing
I'm a north nigga at the end of the day
Gun butt a nigga with the end of the K
Kick you in your ass and send you away
Don't come around here like your niggas are safe
Cause all my hittas going bllllrrrt stick 'em
Fuck if you with 'em
Its money and murder if you fuck with my niggas
You come to my city I fucked all them bitches
I fucked all them bitches cause

[Chorus]
I got the juice, nigga I got the juice
Nigga I got the juice when I hop out the coupe
When I hop out the coupe
Real niggas I'mma salute
Cause I got the juice, I got the juice
Nigga I got the juice, she popping pussy
Like I'm Uncle Luke
Cause I got the juice

[Verse 3]
All she ever wanted was a trap nigga
Every time you ever saw me I was strapped nigga
Getting blunted in the back nigga
No this ain't a 550, this a Bach, nigga
Nigga prolly spend your car money on that act nigga
Couple bands, 5 racks nigga
You call it beefin' when you '@' niggas
We call it beefin' when we clap niggas

[Outro]
I got the juice, nigga I got the juice
Nigga I got the juice when I hop out the coupe
When I hop out the coupe
Real niggas I'mma salute
Cause I got the juice, I got the juice
Nigga I got the juice
Load up the chopper screaming R.I.P. Snupe
Bout to pop out the roof cause I got the juice

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner whipping out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom?
Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, Lord knows I'm filthy rich
All this ice is like fifty bricks
Rap niggas throwing hissy fits
I give my bitch a stack just for a Christmas gift
And my bitch so bad, she on my Christmas list
'Member I prayed, really I wished for this
To get the crib with the maid and with the picket fence
I'm with some niggas that mad, we taking risks for this
I'm talking risky business, flick the wrist
Lord knows that I repent for this
But Lord knows if I get penned for this
I prolly won't get home until I'm fifty-six
They say I'm the Messiah, you rappers is liars
I sign up at church just to rap at the choir
To spit my new verse at your wake while you're lying
The middle of the church have you wake, no I'm lying
I just came from jail, ain't do no crying
They put me through hell, sharpened my iron
I did my push-ups and I roared with the lions
Like hold up, from balling I'm tired
I'm back in this bitch and I'm back on my shit
Man they tell me be humble, I'm cocky as hell
Shout out my bitches that answered my calls
When I called you collect cause it got me through hell
Shout out that judge that denied me my bail
It made me smarter and made me go harder
They locked me up and slowed my album up
But I did not give up cause I knew I would prevail
Came in the game, Philly as shit
Look at these rappers, they silly as shit
I do not know why they be gassing these suckers
But fuck 'em cause I am not feeling their shit
Difference between me and most of these rappers
I'm talking about work that I really put in
Talking about pistols I put on my hip
And I'm talking about foreigns I really could whip
That I really done drove
Really was froze in my hood and these bitches I really did hit
Really was chose, came up from nothing
And now they like, "How he made millions so quick?"
I'm in the back and it feel like a sofa
I done seen bitches I'm fuckin' on Oprah
In my new mansion I feel like I'm Sosa
A brick on the table ain't sniffing no coca, no way

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner, whipping out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom?
Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Uh, niggas can't see me with binoculars on
Back of the Maybach, shottas on
And all my niggas keep choppers on
Don't reach round me, that's a chopper zone
Every time you be on count, what the topic on?
Two hundred and fifty thou' what I dropped it on
See y'all think it's a game 'til FOX be on
CNN, momma picking out boxes for 'em
I want everything, got my own boxers on
Own headphones to get my popping on
I got my own Pumas that I designed 'em for 'em
Stick and moving on these niggas, get my boxing on
All I ever hear from niggas is what they prolly doing
But they be really talkin' 'bout what I be doing
All black Rottweiler, that Givenchy on
Drop top Rolls Royce but the top is on
And the windows down like see y'all later
Mirror tint on that bitch so you could see y'all hating
Champagne cork pop like we all made it
Ya'll looking from the sideline we all hate it
Money don't make it real
Don't give a fuck if its eighty mill', pussy
And just cause you got a Bentley
That Bentley won't make you thorough, pussy
Still hating me from my city
I'm thinking is they for real, pussies
Cause all I got to say is kill
They'll come in like Navy Seals
That's word to my momma, I promise I ain't doing no block
And we shoot at you robbers and kill all you fuck niggas talking
Lately I've been on this money
Don't run it back up just to come and put you in a coffin
I heard you said you was running this city
I seen you in traffic and you was just walking
Niggas be popping that shit like they with it
When niggas start hitting all you did was talk it, you pussy

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner, whipping out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom?
Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You bring out feelings in me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before
I'm a good girl, but I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad-ad-ad
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
And they say bad girls ain't no good
Good girls ain't no fun
I still can't find a nigga that touch that
I don't know one
And I ain't searching for it
Never trust but I'm working on it
Fell in love with that ride game
Swimming pool, you surfing on it
Like 'Yonce, do the surfboard, surfboard
They still think you a church girl
We linking up on your days off
And I still give you that work girl
Like work, twerk
Do it like that video
Wanted that for a long time
Cool with it, I get it though
First year we both fronted
We had feelings we didn't show
Second year we couldn't hide it
Funny part they didn't know
How could something that's so wrong feel so right?
But who to tell you this wrong, though? This your life
Word up

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You bring out feelings in me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before
I'm a good girl, but I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad-ad-ad
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
We just fucking up the city, going hard every night
Niggas hating on us, you know lord they ain't right
Cause I broke a lot of hearts, ain't do them girls right
But you broke hearts too, but that boy ain't fight
So they don't deserve it, it feel like it's perfect
I'm loving your style the way you preserve it
Just look at my eyes and see what's inside
You know that it's pride, you say that I'm worth it
But said I ain't ready, really I'm ready
Really I'm ready, I'm ready like never before
I'mma just give you a key to my heart
You'll be the first that I let in the door
I used to hear that you flirt with them guys
They never would score
All you was hearing about me and the women
Ain't trust them before
You know what you're doing, fuck what they said
You know what we on
When we in bed, it's like we on stage
And I got the mic so let me perform, sing it

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You bring out feelings in me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before
I'm a good girl, but I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad-ad-ad
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
Travel the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 1]
I guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup, hey yeah

Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

[Chorus]
Whatever I said, whatever I did, I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
I want you back, I want you back
I want you back for good

Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
I want you back, I want you back
I want you back for good

[Verse 2]
Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story, it wasn't good
But in the corner of my mind I celebrated glory
But that was not to be

In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find a little room inside for me? Oh

[Chorus]
Whatever I said, whatever I did, I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
I want you back, I want you back
I want you back for good

Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
I want you back, I want you back
I want you back for good

[Bridge]
And we'll be together, yeah, this time is forever
Oh, we'll be fighting and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again, oh whoa

[Chorus]
Whatever I said, whatever I did, I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
I want you back, I want you back
I said I want you back for good

Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
I want you back, I want you back
I said I want you

Whatever I said, whatever I did, I didn't mean it
I just want I just want you
I want you back, I want you back
For good

Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right
I want you back, I want you back
And understood (for good)

Whatever I said just tell me
Where can I find
I want you oh
I want you back, I want you
I want you back for good
Oooh

[Outro]
Whenever I'm wrong I'll tell you
I want you back, I want you back
I want you back for good

[Intro]
Lone wolf and cub
Where will you go?
What will you do
All on your own?
Put up a fight
Heal from your wounds
Lone wolf and cub

[Verse 1:]
Wolf and cub, wolf and cub, wolf and cub
On your own, on your own, on your own
Where will you go? Where will you go? Where will you go?
What will you do? What you do? What you do?
Wolf and cub, wolf and cub, wolf and cub
On your own, on your own, on your own
Where will you go? Where will you go? Where will you go?
What will you do? What you do? What you do?
Wolf and cub, wolf and cub, wolf and cub
On your own, on your own, on your own
Where will you go? Where will you go? Where will you go?
What will you do? What you do? What you do?
Wolf and cub, wolf and cub, wolf and cub
On your own, on your own, on your own
Where will you go? Where will you go? Where will you go?
What will you do? What you do? What you do?

[Verse 1]
There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain

[Chorus 1]
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

[Verse 2]
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

[Chorus 2]
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

[Outro]
Ooh la la la la, in my life

[Chorus 1]
Cupid, draw back your bow, and let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry, and let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

[Verse 1]
Now, I don't mean to bother you, but I'm in distress
There's danger of me losin' all of my happiness
For I love a girl who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix

[Chorus 1]
Cupid, draw back your bow, and let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry, and let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

[Verse 2]
Now Cupid, if your arrow make a love storm for me
I promise I will love her until eternity
I know between the two of us, her heart we can steal
Help me if you will

[Chorus 2]
So Cupid, draw back your bow and let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my tears and let your arrow come near
Straight to my lover's heart for me

[Bridge]
I know that you heard it before, but Cupid, don't go
What would we do if you didn't exist?
We can't be sure but please don't ignore
Cupid the reason you're here

I know that you're feeling discouraged
You think no one cares about love
So Cupid, please do us a favor
Just pick up your bow and let your arrow go

[Chorus 1]
Cupid, draw back your bow, and let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry, and let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

[Chorus 1]
Honey, you are my shining star
Don't you go away, oh baby
Wanna be right here where you are
Until my dying day, yeah baby

[Verse 1]
So many have tried
Tried to find a love like yours and mine
Girl, don't you realize how you hypnotize
Make me love you more each time, yeah baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Honey, I'll never leave you lonely
Give my love to you only
To you only, to you only

[Chorus 2]
Honey, you are my shining star
Don't you go away, oh baby
Gonna be right here where you are
Until my dying day

[Verse 2]
Feels so good when we're lying here next to each other
Lost in love, oh baby
Baby, when we touch, love you so much
You're all I ever dreamed of, oh baby, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Honey, I'll never leave you lonely
Give my love to you only
To you only, to you only

[Chorus 1]
Honey, you are my shining star
Don't you go away, oh baby
Wanna be right here where you are
Until my dying day, oh baby

Honey, you are my shining star
Don't you go away, oh baby
Wanna be right here where you are
Until my dying day, ooh ooh baby

Honey, you are my shining star
Don't you go away girl, oh...

[Bridge: Michael Bublé + Wanya Morris]
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it's begun

[Post-Chorus: all]
And the moment that I can feel that
You feel that way too
When I fall in love, oh yeah
When I fall in love
Is when I fall in love with you

[Pre-Chorus: Jordan Rakei]
Sunlight and you hold me as I breathe
It's a summertime
Cause I'm blowing through the breeze
I said I'm born to you
I'm born to see the day come through
I should care for you
Like you want me to

[Chorus: Jordan Rakei]
(I don't want to see)
Alright
Oh, I don't want to see no more
Alright
Oh, I don't want to see no more
Alright
Oh, I don't want to see no more
Alright

[Verse 1: Jordan Rakei]
Turn me up in this place
It's an ocean of sounds, yeah
'Said turn me up in this place
Til' the notion is found

[Verse 2: Jordan Rakei]
Oh, I don't want to see
It feels like I've been such a stranger
It feels like everything is wrong
It feels like I've been gone for ages

[Bridge: Jordan Rakei]
Assume to be done before
Too long, too long
Too long, too long
Too long

[Verse 3: Jordan Rakei]
The time has come for change, yeah
With no where to escape
With different circumstances
I shouldn't need it to behave
(X2)

[Wanya Morris + (Nathan Morris & Shawn Stockman)]
Listen

Oh, it's been such a long, long time
Looks like I get you off my mind
But I can't
Just the thought of you
(Just the thought of you)
Turns my whole world misty blue

Oh, oh, just the mention of your name (of your name)
Turns a flicker to a flame
Ooh, listen to me, baby
When I think of the things we used to do, oh oh
My whole world turns misty blue (misty blue)

I, oh I should forget you
Hey, heaven knows I've tried (knows I've tried)
When I say, when I say that I'm glad we're through, oh oh
Deep in my heart I know I've lied, I've lied
Ooh (ooh), yeah, (misty blue) misty blue
Oh baby baby, it's been such a long, long time (long time)
Looks like I get you off my mind
But I can't, just the thought of you

Believe me, no no no no, no
I don't wanna be left here by myself
But when you left me, you turned my whole world misty blue

[Chorus: Madonna]
I could be your sister, I could be your mother
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover
That's right, I'd rather be your lover

[Verse 1: Madonna]
I don't know where I stand with you
I never ever make any plans with you
I don't know what I mean to you
The only thing I know is I dream of you
And all that I know (All that I know)
Is I just don't understand (Just don't understand)
Why my, mmmm, happiness
Always lies in the palm of your hand
But—

[Chorus: Madonna]
I could be your sister, I could be your mother
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover
That's right, I'd rather be your lover

[Verse 2: Madonna]
Sometimes I know what you're thinking next
But wouldn't it be better if I loved you less?
Sometimes I think that I made you up
But wouldn't it be better if I gave you up?
And all that I know (All that I know)
Is I just don't understand (Just don't understand)
Why my, mmmm, happiness
Always lies in the palm of your hand
But—

[Chorus: Madonna]
I could be your sister, I could be your mother
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover
That's right, I'd rather be your lover
Are you surprised?

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Hey! Don't slip before they lips say
Even when the media is gettin' greedier, you'll make they hips sway
Creepin' with the bomb ambition
I caught you peepin', and I ain't sleepin'
Got you freakin' through the whole weekend
Frankly speaking, is it passion or just a heat?
Got you tryna get me all up in your satin sheets
What would they say, a blonde and a thug brother
The way you gettin' paid, wish we was lovers
And—

[Bridge: Madonna & 2Pac]
And all that I know (All that I know)
Is I just don't understand (Just don't understand)
(Oh, you don't wanna understand, huh ahahaha)
Why my, mmmm, happiness (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Always lies in the palm of your hand
Now—

[Chorus: Madonna & 2Pac]
I could be your sister (Hey hold on with that)
I could be your mother (I don't need no mothafuckin'—)
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover (Yeah, yeah)
That's right, I'd rather be your lover (I bet you would)
I could be your sister (Chill out with that)
I could be your mother (That's illegal)
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother (Yeah, yeah)
But I'd rather be your lover (Just bringing in girl)
That's right (That's right)
I'd rather be your lover (What you need is a thug in your life)
Are you surprised?
I could be your sister (Hey check this out though)
I could be your mother
We could be friends, I'd even be your brother
But I'd rather be your lover
That's right, I'd rather be your lover (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Are you surprised?
Are you?

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I been that nigga on the corner, nappy braids and selling hard
Now I pull up on 'em bitches, got them texting "Oh my God"
I got bitches out in Paris that be texting "Ooh la la"
I hit back like, "Who this?" She hit back, "You forgot"
Real niggas gon' link up
But my H-town pouring drink up
Just me and Junior in the brinks truck
Doing all this shit we ain't think of
Trying to wild out cause we cranked up
I'm blue-dottin that pink stuff
Maraj putting that pussy on me
Ten bands throw her mink up
I got money all in my mind ho

Condoms all in my condo

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Blew a half a kilo on my cuban link to watch it swing
No shirt, baking soda standing at the sink
Swerving in my Wraith, I should just pull up at the church
Have these niggas playing on me, devils wish it was a hearse
In my all black shades, motherfucking Ray Charles
I used to mop the floors now who the motherfucking boss?
I been that nigga that could get em by the two's
Snow white, no spikes, two stacks for my loubs
You a fool for your wifey and I passed her to my crew
Coke white, sour creme, butter all in my coupe
Put my dogs on salary, you see we all be blowing loud
Chopper still might judge a jury, I could take this bitch to trial

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I been that nigga 'fore the money and the fame
I been that nigga 'fore the diamonds and the chain
I been that nigga 'fore the foreigns and the clothes

I been that nigga, I been that nigga
If he keep talking I'll make him pin that nigga

[Intro: Meek Mill & DJ Khaled]
When you go out, you want an obituary or a documentary?
Which one you want Khaled?
(I want money)
A documentary, right?
(I want that too!)
We gotta make movies

[Verse 1]
Bright lights attracted bad bitches
And attracted mad niggas
Whoever thought lil' ol' Meek Milly'd pass Jigga?
I'm just thinkin' a tad bigger
You niggas talk fly, only fly at your last picture
And you look like the last pitcher
I just hit a home run, on clash with us
And this money, murder, power, comin' for the ass, nigga, ass, niggas
Last nigga, there were cemeteries diggin' grass, nigga
The obituary leaves the last scripture
Mama said he was a good kid, thinkin' would kid
I signed my deal with my AP on
In the drop top with the AC on
Stuntin' with Cash Money, get my Baby on
No, never fuck a chick that got Bakers on
Or no Michael Kors
I'm on the same shit that Mike was on
Jordan, Jackson, Tyson on
I've seen niggas your type twice before
I'm in that white velour, look at the flights I bought
These mothafuckin' hoes got a right to raw
When a young real nigga light the floor
Hundred black bottles, man that's lights galore
Before Tom was Ford, I'm talkin' Honda Accord
Lookin' for a plug, tryna find the cord
Niggas gettin' shot tryna find the Lord
This bust down Rollie say the time is yours
I get my grindin' on
Like rude girl in the reggae, it was mayday
Started with a water gun until I got an AK
Kids in the projects when we was by the bay, bay
Kids with the Pyrex, I hit it first, Ray J

[Chorus]
When the lights low, and the show starts
And the champagne spill on your bow tie
And your dawg change up, playin' both sides
No it won't stop, when the dope stop
When the fed rush in the dope spot
And your main man tell 'em how the coke drop
How he rain danced with me by the boat dock
I know when he did that, I bet that your ghost drop
I hope that you stand up
Young nigga just man up
I'm just hopin' you stand up
Young nigga just man up
I just hope that you man up and don't give the fam up
I just hope that you man up and don't give the fam up
Real nigga for life

[Verse 2]
As the rain drop, drop on the pavement
I came through my hood Mulsanne'n
On the block all night like I ain't famous
I still run with the same niggas I came with
Where I came from, when I came in
We eatin' lobster and steak from Top Ramen
Oodles n'Oodles, when you're hungry them killers'll do you
And when you're gettin' to that money them people pursue you
The Feds lurkin', the streets watchin'
Them hoes talkin', like "he got it"
And he nervous, cause we plottin'
We call that boy for a burner and we rob him
Like Batman, pussy niggas gettin' backhand
Talkin' to the people you a at man
Half rack, we got more ghosts than Pac-Man
And for that paper we be grindin' like a lapdance
Get the money young nigga
Get the money, never fold, cause they comin' young nigga
When the feds get to rushin', better not tell on young nigga
Don't be selfish young nigga, just man up, don't give the fam up
Facin' 20 years when they added them grams up
Plus 5 more, he got booked with a handgun
And now he in the courtroom, givin' his mans up
Rat ass nigga

[Chorus]
When the lights low, and the show starts
And the champagne spill on your bow tie
And your dawg change up, playin' both sides
No it won't stop, when the dope stop
When the fed rush in the dope spot
And your main man tell 'em how the coke drop
How he rain danced with me by the boat dock
I know when he did that, I bet that your ghost drop
I hope that you stand up
Young nigga just man up
I'm just hopin' you stand up
Young nigga just man up
I just hope that you man up and don't give the fam up
I just hope that you man up and don't give the fam up
Real nigga for life

[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Woo! It's hot outside man
Meek Millys coming daddy

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Hundred for the walkthrough, I'm not who you talk to
Drive by and wet you up, nigga thats a carpool
Spitting all this hot shit, every single bar cool
Diamonds in the rollie face, animated cartoon
Call me Meek Milly, I don't play that shit
Got me on my nappy braids before the Maybach clique
Riding in the wheels of fortune, Pat Sajak shit
And all I rock is Balmain like I made that shit
I've been, front row fashion week looking like I'm in the show
Sitting in the foreign, leather softer than a dinner roll
Make a movie on your bitch, tell her friend to get a role
You thought she was innocent, we laughing like she been a ho
Jumpin' out them Benzos, meet yo bitch in the friend zone
She told you I was friendzoned, what? I'm in the endzone
Touchdown with a 2 point conversion, give her that dick long
She busting like the clip long, Uber to send your bitch home nigga

[Interlude: Swizz Beatz]
It's hot outside, it's Meek Milly season

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
I got a fever bitch
Hot outside, I got a fever bitch
Feeling sick, I got a fever bitch
In these Philly streets situations is
Police ain't respecting the youth and
The youth ain't respecting the truth and
The Glock 9 is on me in the booth and
All I talk is that real shit the truth and

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
The money turned your bitch into a gold digger
The money got me feeling like the old Jigga
And Jigga even told me you a cold nigga
They ain't believe me I was broke but I showed niggas
And I told niggas that I would expose niggas
Went to buy a pair of sneaks, landed at the Royce dealer
Brand new paper tag, haters never made me mad
You can ask your baby momma, I'm flyer than her baby dad
Looking at my neck, what that cost? Hundred-eighty cash
Looking at my bitch, she remind me of a Stacey Dash
We was selling rock before Kareem Biggs, Damon Dash
Oh you think you fly with your lil' Dream Chasin' ass?
We don't chase bitches, we chase money and that D'ussé
Cause when you get the money, the hoes do whatever you say
Riding in a drop head, Phantom with the toupee
And if you're just hearing this, then it's probably too late

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
I got a fever bitch
Hot outside, I got a fever bitch
Feeling sick, I got a fever bitch
In these Philly streets situations is
Police ain't respecting the youth and
The youth ain't respecting the truth and
The Glock 9 on me in the booth and
All I talk is that real shit the truth and

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
Meek Milly, Mack Milly
Get smacked silly, come to Philly
Come see it live in direct
You know, godamnit!

[Chorus]
Was the money good?
Was 'em bitches bad? Was they fuckin' good?
Did your hood show you love? Did the hoes say you fly?
If your friends say you're loyal, throw your Rollies in the sky
For the trillest, for the trillest
As the champagne pours and the campaign roars
And the lights shine bright every night they applaud for the trillest

[Verse 1]
See my momma cry too many tears
And we been broke like too many years
It ain't too many kids, a couple homies, there ain't too many there
And they all gotta eat, they got too many kids
Too many kids with no fathers, doing too many bids
Too many bids, judge gave them kids too many years
As soon as you get that money, that's as soon they appear
Assuming you 'em  owe something, they assuming you’ll share
And yeah, I've been losin' touch with my family, it ain't the same
I should've gave my sister some money, but I made it rain
I should've hit the crib with my son and played a game
But instead I ended up at the jeweller to make a chain
It's a sad saying when you make money it make you change
Like four quarters, the fourth quarter, I make a lane
Shit, I had to walk for it they talkin' 'bout takin' trains
And takin' planes, I put the work in and made the name
But the question is

[Chorus]
Was the money good?
Was them bitches bad? Was they fuckin' good?
Did your hood show you love? Did the hoes say you fly?
If your friends say you're loyal, throw your Rollies in the sky
For the trillest, for the trillest
As the champagne pours and the campaign roars
And the lights shine bright every night they applaud for the trillest

[Verse 2]
I never wanted to be like Mike, I wanted to be like Mitch
Now all the lil' niggas wanna be like this
I wear my chain in any city, let you see my shit
Cause I earned that, it's on me, I'mma keep my shit
I got blood on my money, ether in my soul
Do you know the feeling durin' Easter with no clothes?
Now it's stars in the ceiling, bringing ether out the Rolls
With the curtains on the windows, I'm just peekin' at my goals
Money made me iller, already was realer
Young kings killin' young kings over skrilla
That's why I ride around Mac on me like I was Miller
Or Reggie when I shoot for that three
They drop fetty, that's good money
Come to my city, we talk heavy and die young
When we get some paper, we cop Prezis and ride rim
20 inch rims for the dope boy
Sellin' that coke boy, trappin' on your note boy
Got that buy it all money, fuck I need a note for!?
In them school hallways, "fuck I need a note for!?"
We ain't wanna go to class, we was sellin' coke raw
The principal was coppin' too, hit him with a snowball

[Chorus]
Was the money good?
Was them bitches bad? Was they fuckin' good?
Did your hood show you love? Did the hoes say you fly?
If your friends say you're loyal, throw your Rollies in the sky
For the trillest, for the trillest
As the champagne pours and the campaign roars
And the lights shine bright every night they applaud for the trillest

[Verse 3]
Lookin' for the intro
I was at the dealer lookin' for another Benzo
Matching kicks with my Kenzo, young nigga
Heart of a lion, hungry as hippo
When I was on my last, nobody ain't tell me shit though
Flow slicker than Crisco, niggas talkin', I get low
Do my thing, they jump back, know how that shit go
And they say I'm arrogant
I'm still eatin' steak with the asparagus
When I get that money like I married it
1 milly, 2 milly, 3 milly, buried it
Since they say I'm underground, I run that bitch like Harriet
Rolls Royce pushin' real slow like a chariot
Pull up on them niggas that doubted me, shit embarrassin'
I'mma real nigga with money, never cherish it
You a fake niggas with money, it's no comparison
Told me that I couldn't get signed when I was rappin' it
And told me I couldn't do songs when I was battlin'
They told me that I couldn’t be trapper, I started trapping' it
Never listen to 'em, oh well, shit is immaculate
I'mma just go sit up in this Bach again
Smoke the weed and laugh at them
Make a couple million by accident
Couple niggas dropped on Twitter, they say they back again
Couple months later on Twitter they say us laxative
Shitted on 'em, Nicki voice, did it on 'em Benjamins
Plently of 'em Benjamins, semi on him and he on a
Whole 'nother level from before now
Tell my niggas when I see a hundred mil its going down
When I made my first mil, I was like "it's on now"
Then I made my second mil, money on the floor now
Then I made my third mil, I'm like "I need more now?"
I got in my zone and that money started pourin' down
Every time I hit the booth, microphone torn down
We couldn't get a pair of Pumas, we up in the store now, bitches!

[Verse 1]
There's something in this liquor, the air is getting thicker
I can't help but to stare at you, oh yeah, girl what did you do to me?
What did you slip up in my cup, girl? Cause I want you, oh yeah
I had a little bit too much girl, so come over here

[Chorus]
There's something in this liquor, oh yeah
The air is getting thicker
All I want is you-ou-ou-ou
All I want is you-ou-ou-ou

[Verse 2]
There's something in this liquor girl, I'm looking at your figure woah
I just want to see you strip right now, baby let me help you work it out, oh
Girl you look so good, I just wanna get right to it, oh
I could beat it up like-like a real nigga should, baby when we do it, woah

[Chorus]
There's something in this liquor, oh yeah
The air is getting thicker
All I want is you-ou-ou-ou
All I want is you-ou-ou-ou

[Post-Chorus]
All I wanna do is drink and fuck, drink, drink and fuck
All I wanna do is drink and fuck, and fuck, and fuck
All I want is you-ou-ou-ou, drink and fuck, drink, drink and fuck
Drink and fuck, and fuck, and fuck

[Bridge]
There's something in this liquor, there's something in this liquor girl
The air is getting thicker, the air is getting thicker
I can't help but stare at you, oh, yeah, girl what did you do? (Why?)
What did you slip up in my cup girl? Cause I want some
I had a little bit too much girl, so come over here, woah

[Post-Chorus]
All I wanna do is drink and fuck, drink, drink and fuck
Drink and fuck, and fuck, and fuck
Drink and fuck, drink, drink and fuck
Drink and fuck, and fuck, and fuck

[Outro]
All I wanna do is drink and, drink, drink and
Drink and, and, and
Drink and, drink, drink and
Drink and, and, and

[Verse 1]
Living in lies by the railway line
Pushing the hair from my eyes
Elvis is English and climbs the hills
Can't tell the bullshit from the lies
Screaming along in South London
Vicious but ready to learn
Sometimes I fear that the whole world is queer
Sometimes but always in vain

[Chorus]
So I'll wait until we're sane
Wait until we're blessed and all the same
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give
Englishmen going insane

[Refrain]
Down on my knees in Suburbia
Down on myself in every way

[Verse 2]
With great expectations I change all my clothes
Mustn't grumble at silver and gold
Screaming above Central London
Never bored, so I'll never get old

[Chorus]
So I'll wait until we're sane
Wait until we're blessed and all the same
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give
Englishmen going insane

[Refrain]
Down on my knees in suburbia
Down on myself in every way

[Outro]
Day after, day after day, day after
Zane, Zane, Zane, Ouvre le chien
Day after day, day after
Zane, Zane, Zane, Ouvre le chien
Day after

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah, la-da-da, la-da-da-da, yeah

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I never had a role model
I was loading gold hollows in my little Glock-40
A little shorty, heart colder than December in the morning
And I think it was December when they swarmed me
Niggas is jealous, fuck can they tell us
With them dreams they try to sell us? Probably why I'm rebellious
To a fraud nigga, I lost niggas when I got paper
It's like more money I made, they got faker
And it's crazy when your best friend turn into your top hater
Wanna roll out on you and smoke you like top paper
Damn, what a feeling when you and your homie chilling
And you know he got thoughts of probably robbing and killing you
Momma said don't ever, ever let them belittle you
And stay away from them haters cause they'll riddle you
Last year was like a bad year
Even though I touched more paper than a cashier
Small circle, I ain't never really 'round squares
They say there's levels to this shit, you niggas downstairs
Different floors for different bulls
Different tours on different jets, my niggas saw
Different city with different bitches and different whores
Sometimes I look in the mirror, Meek Milly, this your car?
Look at your arm, check out your neck, look at your charm
And to think my niggas started off with cooking raw
When it was hard the coach told me to get the ball
I step back for the three, watch it go swish and fall
And that was and-one, they thinking how we get this far?
We was just down by three and they thought we took a loss
They couldn't D me like Earl Boykins, I'm sticking soft
Tried to pick me off like Champ Bailey but I'm Randy Moss
And I ran it all for the touchdown, what now?
Gold AP all bust down, fuck clowns

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
My heart getting cold, and the streets getting colder
They said I wouldn't make it no way
I think my heart getting colder, my heart getting cold
Told them I would make it one day, only Lord knows

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Dedicated, determinated and disciplined
When Diddy, Hova, and Baby talking, I'm listening
When I be in the jungle, the Devil be whispering
Slugs flying by me I hear them, they whistling
That was a close call
Stand up nigga so I won't fall
My teacher told me I would never go far
Seen him last week, he was my chauffeur, I was like "told y'all"
Mommy was a booster, daddy was a shooter
So they couldn't blame me when I went and copped a Ruger
Looking at my homies, see the ghost of Freddy Krueger
Cause if he catch you sleeping he's gon' knock out your medulla
Oblongata, I'm a father and my son don't see a lot of
If I don't get he gon' probably end up with a chopper
In a field out in Philly do you feel me?
Told my momma I won't let these haters kill me
Getting high even though it might derail me
And I won't ever let these bitches see the real me, do you feel me?
Times change like the Rollie did
Now I'm killing these niggas the way that Kobe did

[Interlude: Diddy]
Ayo, it gets fucked up when your own family start calling you up
Shit, money's the root of all evil
Family start telling you "you acting different nigga"
You're goddamn right I'm acting different
With all this motherfucking money
But then when it comes from your brother, your sister
Your mother, your father, that shit hurts you to the core man
When they start acting like something that you ain't never motherfucking seen
You done grew up motherfucker
They gave birth to you, know what I'm saying?
You got raised, you done played in the park with them
This money thing, this shit will fuck you up man
You got to watch what you ask for
You sure you want this son? You sure you want this money?
You sure you want this fame? You sure you want this power?
Shit have your own mama talking to you like you ain't shit
Yeah everybody want it, everybody need it, money motherfuckers
Get money don't stop but I ain't mad at them
Shit, but shit even bosses got feelings you know?
Dear mama, dear papa, family, we're all we got
Don't let this money bring us down
Shit, everybody eats B, everybody eats, everybody eats
Let's go, hahahah

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Uh, yeah
And we started off as kids, stomach's touching our ribs
And them streets all night like we ain't have nowhere to live
I remember Sundays we ain't have nothing but Liv
Thirty thousand was the tab and you ain't have nothing to give
I ain't trip, I ain't trip, I pour bottles, I ain't sip
I let niggas shine bright, you still act like I ain't shit?
Let you have them little hoes, they was all on my dick
And your main wanted to fuck me nigga, I ain't hit
Twenty chains, eight watches, can't fit on my wrist
When I speak about them things I never said it's my shit
I said it's ours nigga and when you're ready we're gonna ball nigga
Like Kobe Bryant, Metta Peace and Gasol, nigga
But I know just what I saw nigga
It was envious, you looked sideways and I remembered it
The reason that my heart's cold now on some December shit
You used to give thanks for giving on some November shit
Talking about the twenty-fifth, matter of fact the twenty-sixth
Maybe it's the twenty-eighth, fuck it though my money's straight
As long as Papi smiling
I'mma be on airplane mode flier than a pilot
I've seen it, I've seen it
Jealousy in your eyes, I swear that look was deceiving
And I was surprised man I ain't want to believe it
You said you would ride but shit, I know you ain't mean it
But yeah nigga I've seen it

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
My heart getting cold, and the streets getting colder
They said I would't make it no way
I think my heart getting colder, my heart getting cold
Told them I would make it one day, only Lord knows
The gospel according to tony day
The gospel according to tony day
The gospel according to tony day
If I find a girl he'll take her away
Rotten tony!

The gospel according to brendan o'lear
The gospel according to brendan o'lear
The gospel according to brendan o'lear
If I buy him a scotch, he'll buy me a beer
Tight fist, friends

The gospel according to pat hewitt
The gospel according to pat hewitt
The gospel according to pat hewitt
If it's written on a sweater then I'd better not, you do it

Ah!

Got to, got to
Your mind, blow I
Blow it
The gospel according to marianne brent
The gospel according to marianne brent
The gospel according to marianne brent
She'll be mine if I pay the rent

Good old marianne, who needs friends, oh
That's the fucking time, take a look at my life and you'll see
Take a quick, butchers, rotten mary down the oak
Wouldn't give me two pence for him

[Intro]
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
London on the track, bitch

[Chorus]
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want the money
Bring me all my money

[Verse 1]
I just want that money, nigga
I don't give no damn about no fame
I just get that head and go
Plus that lil bitch got a pink pussy like a yam
I'll pop it I'll make that booty say bang bang
I'm icy so she failed to maintain her lane
I'm so priceless I swear to God I can't complain
No no no no I can't
I woke up with a smiling face
Lil shorty keep following like she down to play
I can't fill my truck up with no fucking strays
But I can fill it up with all my bass
And that's no lie that's no lie
I'm balling so hard I need Gatorade
Eat your candy now and later

[Chorus]
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want the money (I want racks)
Bring me all my money
I just want the money
Bring me all my money (Bring me all the money)
I just want the money (I just want the money)
Bring me all my money (Uh)

[Verse 2]
My jewelry wet like water hose
I didn't buy no spinners I had stop and goes
Yeah I was tired started stopping goals
Used to rob for birds now I'm flocking those
Hell yeah nigga flock (Brrrrr!)
King cobra nigga watch
The P stand for players they eat pies
The B stand for bodies who wan' die? Hey!
Who wan' motherfucking die today today?
Bought a gold casket I killed him and paid
I swear I'm back in my John Dillinger ways
Go buy a milk carton he missing today
Get my cookie from San Fransisco Bay
It's time to start planning put on your game face
Godfather, I killed them all in one day
I meant a whole dime at one time oh my

[Chorus]
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want the money
Bring me all my money

[Verse 1]
Look at this poor boy
All dressed up in white
Now how can he smile
With a face of all eyes
He wanders the night
Through sneers and words snide
Spinning round and round
His precious mind
Like dizzy neon lights

[Chorus 1]
Can anybody find out
Any other way
It's choking up his throat now
And dripping out his mouth
Like liquified and dying sparks
Like burning butterflies
These creatures are vampires
They're killing by the night
They're falling from the dead trees
To silhouette your life

[Verse 2]
He sees his white face
Brains limp grey and cold
Trees grow in their throats
And crystals ignored
His cellophane mask
Has filled up with smoke
Look through the holes in his eyes
And see his red righteous soul

[Chorus 2]
Can anybody find out
Any other way
It's choking up his throat now
And dripping out his mouth
These creatures are vampires
They're killing by the night
They're hanging from the dead trees
Like burning butterflies

[Intro: Kool A.D.]
Kinda cold and I'm with someone (na na na na na)
Here we go now na na na na
There ain't nothing you can do about it
(na na na na)
Know I knew you were the one for me (na na na na)
Never mind, never mind, never mind

[Verse 1: Kool A.D.]
Why eat chocolate candy? type profit dandy type
We wrote this on a tandem bike
On Mount Tam with a random dyke
Masculine feminine sandal like
See my writs on DatPiff
I spit jazz by candle light, I'm a beast
Victor Vasquez man you might like
How I stand on a land at night and day
Transitional light, period is right
Weird little shits for beardy kids and 20 year bids
First time offenders who feel like their lives ended
Only to start again too late
I'm about love I don't do hate
I don't want to write this down
I just want to tell you how I feel right now
I don't want to write this down na na now now

[Verse 2: SAFE]
Left the park now, I feel like a spaceship
Coolest night of the year, but they taste it
Mama asleep, but the front door is silent
You can rub the nigga and I love the violets
Leave them as struck as me and I love the violence
Snort alone and you see me just cryin'
Stand still, atrophy is a violence
Crush the pill, a trophy is violence
Little child doesn't know how to light it
Kiss her ring, kiss her finger cause I'm tryin'
Slap my face, hold me down, grab me wrist
Cuban links, Cuban links, Cuban links
Years later, you still hurt me badly
But, I never hit her, she hurt me badly
I'm trying to leave here, but I couldn't see away, away

[Outro: Toro Y Moi]
You and me got two weeks, gotta make it worth while
Gotta make the day long, look at how much we work
You and me got two weeks, gotta make it worth while
Gotta make the day long, look at how much we work

[Produced by The New Royales]

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can hear the drummer drummin'
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone
I know something's comin'
But I'm runnin' from it, to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was?
Was it too good to be true?
Have nothin', get it all but too much of it
Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens?
‘Cause if not, where the hell did it go?
‘Cause here I sit in Lucifer’s den by the dutch oven
Just choosing to sin, even if it means I'm sellin' my soul
Just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
‘Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that? I’m somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark
This sport is somethin' I never bow-out at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are countin' me out
And I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about
Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
‘Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here
But I'm not a quitter; gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'
I'm tryna be headstrong
But it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
‘Cause you're moving onto the next, but is your respect gone?
‘Cause someone told me that…

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Kings never die

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't give me that sob story, liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features
And try to show out on a track with me
But it'd actually have to be
A fuckin' blow-out to get me to retire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous
Comeback, as if I went away
But detractors just say so much for the renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage, and I feel like I'm in a cage
They so want a champion to fall
It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em
‘Cause why can't we win 'em all?
So fuck what these cynics say!
It just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed ta
With this pent-up rage, ‘cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
‘Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow, and I'm not gonna be…

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I want it, I'm comin' to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck
You’re gonna get Riddick Bowe’d
Critics'll end up in critical
Think your shit is dope, all you're gonna get is smoked
And I ain't stopping 'til I'm on top again
All alone and on a throne, like a token of respect
Or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm
And launched so hard it broke my collarbone
And when it's my time to go
I'm still not leaving, stop for no one, I don't know
But I've been told, an obstacle that blocks your road, ya
Knock it over, time to go for the pot of gold, ‘cause…

[Bridge: Eminem]
They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay
They just grow wings and they fly
So, hands up, reach for the sky!
Try to hold on and prolong these moments
‘Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over

[Verse 4: Eminem]
So you're tryna secure your legacy like Shakur
And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leavin' this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral, berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus, I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness; kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts
At Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas
Still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silverscreen
But Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat, ‘cause makin' the beat
Ain’t the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is
Or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is
It's that sound-bombing, Thirstin Howl
Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz
Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone
God, just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down
I'ma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't…

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Outro: Gwen Stefani]
Kings never die

[Intro]
Action

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
05' pounds in the Laredo, they gotta get there today though
Ain’t no time for tryna lay low, bay bro
If you can’t do it all you gotta do is say no
I’ll take it from there, Ace is on Grand ready to work it
Displayed a smirk like Mr. Perfect
Under the bridge, behind the van, in the cab, I made the drop off
Thank science that nothing popped off, since I was young, had a lust for foreign vehicles and things
My father wore the ring when he pushed me in the swing
Plus he pushed that red thing, I wanted to be like him so bad
Wear the same shoes that he stepped in, of course I need paper
I want to ride the one-seater like speed racer
In the Jetta smoking a one sheet in the green acres
Listening to bullshit music, thinking how I’m gonna do this

[Chorus: Rico Love]
Uh, temptations real
Even though we feel we’ve been here before
Somebody help me
Lord have mercy
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
But what about the rest of us?
What about the rest of us?
Screaming, somebody help me
But what about the rest of us?
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
Turn the lights on

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
I’m from a place called the jungle where the living is rough
It had me low for a while now I’m picking it up
Holding the spot straight sticking it ripping it up
I dropped 99 problems, switching and not giving a fuck
So what you what you want? Got your bitch nigga gripping her butt
Her and my dick, taking pics nigga flicking it up
My click is wassup get buck if you want?
You end up dumped chump, in the pond lake in a truck in New York
There’s no ducking me, the Bada$$ time, but no fuckery
Won’t find a chick who got a dime or take a single buck from me
These hoes be loving me, I keep it so G
Respecting where I be nigga check your OG
My rap flow, imperial fad flows
Well here it go my, visions is linear when I’m ripping the video
It’s a lyrical miracle when I enter your stereo
The rarest breeds, sick like venereal diseases

[Chorus: Rico Love]
Uh, temptations real
Even though we feel we’ve been here before
Somebody help me
Lord have mercy
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
But what about the rest of us?
What about the rest of us?
Screaming, somebody help me
But what about the rest of us?
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
Turn the lights on

[Bridge: Rico Love]
Dying for nothing
Killing to live, fighting for something
Too bad we don’t know what it is
What you think all of this cash for?
Trying to put stamps on my passport
Man I’m just scheming on new hoes
I already forgot about my last broad

[Chorus: Rico Love]
Uh, temptations real
Even though we feel we’ve been here before
Somebody help me
Lord have mercy
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
But what about the rest of us?
What about the rest of us?
Screaming, somebody help me
But what about the rest of us?
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
Turn the lights on

[Intro: Royce Da 5’9”]
Everything I say be raw (good God)
I'm hardbody, everything I say be raw
Everything I say be raw
I'm hardbody, everything I say be raw (good God)
Everything I say be raw
I'm hardbody, everything I say be raw (good God)
Everything I say be raw
Everything I say be raw

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
You can never be my nemesis
You against me is me being a fool
And you being an enemy with benefits
I don't even consider myself deep
When I'm rollin' with thirty niggas
'Cause I'm so used to being in a syndicate
Boots on with my strap on me
You don’t know how Yeezy the season finna get
Bad and Evil, catch a body, catch your body that’s a membership
Put you on my hit list then turn around and kill up all the snitches
Then turn around and go to church, repent
Then ask the reverend, “Can I get a witness?”
Ha, I got an I.O.U. on my Bible’s view
Even God knows what I’m liable to do
When I’m high, bro, I represent the same significance
In hip-hop as Pac and Biggie
Driving side car door, 'cept I'm alive though
Best believe I got no problem fucking your bitch, raw
And that mean I got no condom
Panamera Porsche, factory real white
That’s me in real life
And I’ll probably be ménaging more than the back of Meek Mill bike, I’m Hollywood

[Hook: Royce da 5’9”]
Good God, everything about me raw
From the lyrics to the gun play
I'm hardbody, everything I say be raw
And I mean it (ooh!, I'm raw)
Everything I do be raw
What I do, I do it one way
I'm hardbody, everything about me raw
And I mean it

[Interlude: Danny McBride]
"On top of the world
Every motherfucker wants to get a piece of your ass
Then if you take a little time off from being unstoppable
Just to regroup and relax
No one will give you the time of fucking day"

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm the rawest, uh, rest of y'all just one of a
I’m becoming what I used to make fun of, a
Smug son of a bitch, fuck it though
Going for the fucking jugular
Leave them in a puddle of blood I’m a
Killer, but I'm a cut above the others
Bloody glove in a prison yard, Jodi Arias
I’m coming for you, fuck if the world doesn’t approve
Here I come as a custodian I'm dressed, to smuggle ya
Ass out wrapped up in a comforter come snuggle up with
Another fucking nut, we’ll make a tub of truffle butter
I’ma take this chubby, shove it up that nice round little bubble butt
Make it double-stuffed
Pull it out one hole, put it in the other one
Make a peanut butter cup, bust (yeah)
We can fuck on a golf cart
Tell me how you want it, soft, hard, or fucking rough
Like a dog bark, stop at a Walmart
Get a couple of 50 watt bulbs with a hot tub
Fill up them buns with a hot dog
To be frank these other motherfuckers ain’t even in the ball park
Then she pulled out the condiment drawer
She must heard this is where the condoms get stored
Sign above the door to the sauna says
“Welcome to Sodom and Gomorrah”
Told her I got something for her
Sharp and it’s pointed
And it’s head’s on swole, hold it like a samurai
She said, “Woah, look at that bulge, must have a huge ego”
I said, “Is it me you’re aiming that compliment toward?”
She said, “Yes, my ninja, please get to stabbing this shit”
I commenced to dropping them drawers
Threw my b
