ntrol, this girl's got a hold on me

[*"oh" - repeated until the end*]

[Intro: Common]
I come up in the dance with a slip of sensi
Whether peanuts, epitome too, or envy
A family affair, everything is carefree
I ain't get up off the wall until I heard Mary

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
If you're floatin' real high and you're feelin' the vibe
Won't you get on the floor and just dance for me?
If you feelin' the groove, it ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor and just dance for me
And I know you been stressed, this whole week got you messed up
Get on the floor and just dance for me
'Cause we here, ain't no joke, so stay here 'til we're closed
And stay up on the floor and just dance for me

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
Hey, I know it's been rough
But I'm tryna make it easy
For everybody to dance for me

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
So come one, come all, come everybody (Come on, come on)
Me and you, all of us 'bout to really party (Really party)
And you know that we're gonna put it down (Put it down)
After two more drinks, we'll be feelin' the sound

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
If you're floatin' real high and you're feelin' the vibe
Won't you get on the floor and just dance for me? (Come dance with me)
If you feelin' the groove, it ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor and just dance for me

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Get off the wall, 'cause I know that you can feel me
Stop the fronting and dance for me

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
So come one, come all, come everybody (Come on, come on)
Me and you, all of us 'bout to really party (Really party)
And you know that we're gonna put it down (Oh)
After four more drinks, we'll be falling down

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
If you're floatin' real high and you're feelin' the vibe
Won't you get on the floor and just dance for me?
And I know you been stressed, this whole week got you messed up
Get on the floor and just dance for me

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Leave all your troubles and your cares behind
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, not tonight, no
Don't drink too much, because we have all night
Don't you rush, because it's all night long

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
If you're floatin' real high and you're feelin' the vibe
Won't you get on the floor and just dance for me? (Dance for me)
If you feelin' the groove, it ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor and just dance for me (Oh, dance for me)
And I know you been stressed, this whole week got you messed up
Get on the floor and just dance for me (Dance for me, yeah)
'Cause we here, ain't no joke, so stay here 'til we're closed
And stay up on the floor and just dance for me (Oh)

[Verse 3: Common]
While ladies shake they thangs, brothers chains swang
Dancing is a ritual we use to maintain
Whether steppin' or Crip walkin', over music, **** talkin'
Hard times get softened in spots we hit often
Off in a loft, basement party, or a strip club
Good times, good wine, gotta skeet to trick dubs
It's up to you, I ain't gon' tell you where you has to be
Like the ghost of Marvin, come on and dance for me

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
If you're floatin' real high and you're feelin' the vibe
Won't you get on the floor and just dance for me?
If you feelin' the groove, it ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor and just dance for me
And I know you been stressed, this whole week got you messed up
Get on the floor and just dance for me
'Cause we here, ain't no joke, so stay here 'til we're closed
And stay up on the floor and just dance for me
If you're floatin' real high and you're feelin' the vibe
Won't you get on the floor and just dance for me?
If you feelin' the groove, it ain't nothing for you
To just get on the floor and just dance for me

[Intro: Beyoncé & Jay-Z]
Bass (Uh)
Hi-hat (Uh)
808 (Uh)
Jay (Uh-huh, ready, uh-huh)
Let's go get 'em (Uh-huh)
C'mon (C'mon)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z & (Beyoncé)]
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B. (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B., she about to sting, stand back

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Baby, seem like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes, I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly, I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu

[Verse 3: Beyonce]
Seeing things that I know can't be, am I dreaming?
When I saw you walkin' past me, almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losin' it

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
Yes, Hova's flow so unusual
Baby girl, you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro
'Cause you gon' need help tryna study my bounce
Flow, blow, what's the difference?
One you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dope, po-po try to convict him
Thats a no-go, my dough keep the scales tippin'
Like 4-4s, like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one of one, nothin' after me
No Déjà Vu, just me and my... (Oh!)

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missin' you
That I'm having Déjà Vu?

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu

[Intro: Commissioner Mike and Common]

[?] 555 Madison Avenue

[?] drive by
This is life in this world
Some things go right, some things go wrong
It's just how the world can be
People just wanna be free, yeah

[Verse 1: Common]
The verdict came in and it said I was guilty
I looked at the judge, "Hey, America built me"
Tried to get rich, but they label me filthy
Only God can judge me, touch me, feel me

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas & (Common)]
My friend calls me at nine o'clock
Says, "Get the car, it's time to rock"
Never heard him speak this way (Let's go, man)
I grab the keys and hit the road
It's all a flash, but who would know
How the story would unfold

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Common]
Don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place, wrong time
Don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place, wrong time
Don't charge me for the crime

[Verse 3: Nick Jonas]
My friend gets in the car with bags
Filled to the top with loads of cash
And throws his pistol on the dash
Says, "I'm sorry for the crime
That I've involved you in this time
You're the only friend I've got"

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Common]
So don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place, wrong time
Don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place, wrong time, uh
Don't charge me for the crime

[Verse 4: Joe Jonas]
I start to freak and scream so loud
Just like the females in the crowd
That's when he gets in my head
You could live just like a king with everything you'd ever need
All the dreams of every man

[Chorus: Joe Jonas & Common]
Don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place, wrong time, uh, yeah
Don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place, wrong time, you know, uh
Don't charge me

[Verse 5: Common]
Siren sound and my heart was pounding
I looked at my man as the cops surround him
A teen on the scene with no objective
The American dream can be so deceptive

[Verse 6: Nick Jonas]
Now, I see the flashing lights
There goes my future and my life
Now, I've gotta do what's right
I stop the car and throw the keys
Out of the window sets me free
I throw the pistol in the back
Throws me out of the car
You know me well
I'm not going to jail
I'm not paying your bail
Believe me when I say

[Chorus: Nick Jonas, Joe Jonas & Common]
They won't charge me for the crime
Wrong place, wrong time
Don't charge me for the crime
Wrong place, wrong time
Don't charge me
Wrong place, wrong time
Don't charge me for the
Crime

[Intro: Tone]
Unstoppable
Trackmasters, Rockland, come on

[Verse 1: Foxy Brown]
Na-na so sick, make your toes twitch
Get up in yo' ass and ride that shit
Oh yeah, dare you act shady with the first lady?
Let's go half on this baby
Inner thighs thick so when we fuck you must put me in a swiss ho'
Room 704, fuck they mad at me fo'?
Skin copper, na-na stay proper, who could stop her?
Nuthin'.  Hey, do a somersault
All that platinum shit you bought?
Nigga, fuck you thought, it ain't my fault
Keep the wrist rocky, attitude cocky
Next time you see me, address me like, "Miss Foxy"
It's for the wrist? Cop it.  If it's a six?  Drop it
Thongs with topless, how you like that Robbie?
Ain't nothing sweet, you know my style, doggy style
From the back, in the back, hit it like that

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Foxy Brown]
The dolla bill
Nuthin' but stacks get you anything
Anywhere, as a matter of fact, dollar bill
Say what you want baby
While you be stalling at the lights
We be dippin' in Mercedes
Dollar bill
Can get us from here to Rio
In two hours first class still time to take a shower
The dollar bill
Where ever we be it's VIP stats,  no doubt
So what y'all cats know about that

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Say lady, I'm liking what I see
Come on and talk to me baby, baby, baby
Can't you see one night is all I need
We'll go somewhere and be
Talkin' about your future plans with me
I would do anything
To have you in my life,  that's right
We can take a flight out of here, go anywhere

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Uh uh, I got proof rims on the V-12
Make you raise the roof, no gold in the tooth
Put some in the vault CD's overseas
Private lofts, I'm you haters holocaust
Ain't my fault I rap, then still made a mill'
But it's my fault I got my own label deal
Vacation in Japan while you wish for Bennihana's
On the way to pick up Madona, the ill na-na

[Verse 4: Foxy Brown]
Now you know the na-na plays with the big boys, aye'day
From the six coupe to the big Royce, can you handle that?
A lotta sass and ass with that
And I'm strictly for the dough
So, fuck you think I'm here fo'?
Princesses in a row, row platinum status
Ice lace to pink face
Then I back the faggots
See me rocking ery'thang from Mongolians to Persians
Y'all still learning, I got 'em swervin', through a sermon
And there's nuthin' you can tell me 'bout these cats that I
Don't even ram through a plan, too much stack
Must I, continue this?
Might be a couple of cats that I miss
We could skip the French kiss, take it straight to the wrist
And it gets no iller than this
Na-na engraved on canary ice, see me wear it twice
Did y'all niggas hear me right?
Me and Kelly put the lock down on New York to Chi-town
His town to my town, for the dollar bill

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Foxy Brown]
The dolla bill
Nuthin' but stacks get you anything
Anywhere, as a matter of fact, dollar bill
Say what you want baby
While you be stalling at the lights
We be dippin' in Mercedes
Dollar bill
Can get us from here to Rio
In two hours first class still time to take a shower
The dollar bill
Where ever we be it's VIP stats,  no doubt
So what y'all cats know about that

[Verse 5: R. Kelly & (Tone)]
Tell me who dat said dat we couldn't rock
I roll the dice, bet the dots say we won't stop
I roll from Chitown to Cali, hit your block
I bless the day that R&B music meet hip hop
(You haters thought that Kelly couldn't keep it hot)
Even when I'm in your face, y'all see me not
Sportin' nothing but the rocks, navigators on the block
Merridian CD's with five TV's
College honeys follow in your GS3
We on the way to IHOP, coming from the spot
Niggas in the lot jammin' to the knock
(Y'all mad cuz you can't get what we got)
Who's the number one contender, January through December?
Cut your forest down while you niggas screamin' Timothy
Sophia know me from the beach house in Miami
(Banks know me) so I could give a damn about the Grammies

[Outro: R. Kelly]
The dollar bill
Dollar bill y'all, dollar bill y'all, dollar bill y'all
The dollar bill

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
All my niggas, take a walk with me
You ain't gotta holla, you can talk with me
Just try to learn where my thoughts can be and how I stack figures
Learn why I'm real, still that nigga
I get money, I ain't gotta do a crime
Shit, I hit dimes, what I need with a nine
Before y'all judge me, be clear
We got nothing but heat here, beware, we here
What's my name? Got chicks twisted, like, what's my game?
Pimp things still the same
I smash it, I don't harass it
Ma, I'm a baller, I score and pass it
Feel me, still be filthy
If making hits is a crime, I plead guilty
And this is what we came do
Party, Diddy, Usher, game is through, come on

[Verse 2: Usher]
It's right around eleven o'clock
One of your girls just called
Asked you how you look, are you ready?
You tell her you look hot
Not to worry at all
Niggas will be shook, y'all doing it heavy
She's telling you she might change
But you tell her not to
She know that she looks stunning, it'll be fun
The club will be full of game
But none of that has got you
Me, I think you're running 'cause I'm the one
You see...

[Chorus: Usher]
I don't know what you came to do, girl
What you came to do tonight
But I came to party, oh
I don't know what you came to do, girl
What you came to do tonight
But I came to party, oh

[Bridge: Usher]
You're probably thinking to yourself, what's the occasion?
And believe me, girl, I don't just sex for fun
I'm the perfect gentleman in every situation
And the only thing that's missing is the one
Is it you?

[Chorus: Usher]
I don't know what you came to do, girl (Say what?)
What you came to do tonight
But I came to party, oh
I don't know what you came to do, girl
What you came to do tonight
But I came to party, oh

[Interlude: Usher & Pharrell Williams]

Ghetto girls (la, la, la)
Suburban girls (la, la, la)
International girls, you smell me? (la, la, la, la)

[Verse 3: Usher]
Had to take the time
To open up your mind
That's exactly what you are: open
You got the memorizing grind
Your shape should be a crime
Damn baby you're a star, you're smoking

[Bridge: Usher]
You're probably thinking to yourself, what's the occasion?
And believe me, girl, I don't just sex for fun
I'm the perfect gentleman in every situation
And the only thing that's missing is the one
Is it you, yeah?

[Chorus: Usher]
I don't know what you came to do, girl
What you came to do tonight
But I came to party
I don't know what you came to do, girl
What you came to do tonight
But I came to party

[Outro: Usher & Pharrell Williams]
It's real serious
You're so fine, girl
At the end of the day, I'm going home with you
I don't know what you came to do, girl
What you came to do tonight (you're so fine, girl)
But I came to party (at the end of the day, I'm going home with you)

[Intro: Diddy & Mary J. Blige]

Here we go again (Mm-mm)
Haha, yeah (Mm-mm)
This is the remix, we back together again (Mm-mm-mm)
Let's go, Mary, yeah

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
All the love we gave
The lovin' that we made
Then you went away
So I had to pray
To see a brighter day
'Cause I was led astray
Now I'm moving on to get away from all this pain

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I feel (I feel)
Better than I felt before (So much better)
'Cause there's no more drama knockin' at my door
I feel (No more)
Better than I felt before
'Cause there's no more drama in my life no more

[Post-Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Diddy]
No more (No more, no more)
No more (No more, ooh, this is the remix, I like this, c'mon)

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
It's lookin' better now
A brand new love I found
I finally figured out
What love is all about
And now I'm on my way
And all I have to say
Is there'll be no more cryin' and I truly believe that I

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I feel (I feel)
Better than I felt before (So much better, better)
'Cause there's no more drama knockin' at my door
I feel (Yeah, yeah)
Better than I felt before (Ooh)
'Cause there's no more drama in my life no more

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige and Diddy]
It's time to realize (People, it's time)
It's all up to you and I (All up to you and I)
Life is what you make it
If you don't give up the fight (Don't give up)
All this really means, that's all we need
Believe in all you feel (Ayo, Mary, I don't think they ready for this one)

[Verse 3: Diddy]
Yo, it's the D-I, D again, D to the weezy (Yeah)
Been in the game twelve years, it ain't easy (Uh-huh)
Been in them Dames, got game that's so greasy (That's right)
Spendin' them thangs with a chain that's so freezy (Let's go)
Please believe me, TV need me (Haha)
Far as the CD, pump that on GP (Pump that)
What's the 411, hun? It's PD (Say what?)
MJB collabo with the BB (That)
Period, no question, no comma (What?)
You're hearin' this no vest and no armor (That's right)
Bring it to cats like Bush to Osama (Take that)
Sippin' on 'Vu, make moves, ain't no scama (Haha)
Word to my mama (Yeah), can't deal with the trauma (C'mon)
That's why a nigga stay in the Bahamas (What?)

Bodyguards, top guns, two extra llamas

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]

Taking out you suckers and you don't know how I do it

For making everybody dance till the sun come up

[ROC]
We going all the way to the top
Mary Blige and ROC
The Queen of R&B, the King of Hip-Hop

But fellas it's our year to do our thang
Make girls scream and get the cream
Now listen to Mary sing
Tell 'em I'm everything

And every night I pray

[Verse 1 - Jamie Foxx]
Last night me and my dogs were hanging out
Tired of being cramped up in the house
We were simply celebrating life
Off from work today so it's alright
But all those ups and downs had me in a twist
Started dancing with this model chick
And then every record became my favorite song
And that is all that I remember

[Hook]
Cause I had one too many drinks
And ended up at the Embassy
With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee
It was a one night extravaganza

[Verse 2 - Jamie Foxx]
When I woke up from last night's avoutrie
Baby girl was laying next to me
Shoes and clothes were scattered everywhere
I got dressed and got up out of there
But not before I called for me a cab
Hung over from all the drinks I had
And now I'm telling my story to you
Everything that I remember

[Hook x2]

[Jamie Foxx (with ad-libs)]
Extravanganza
Extravavganza
Only was an extravaganza
Yes it was the things that I remember
And I remember

[Verse 3 - Kanye West]
Bein' at the bar tryin' ask what that hypno hit fo' (Hit fo')
Knowin' I can't afford to get mo' (Get mo')
Here's a broke nigga tricked buy one bottle and sip slow (sip slow)
Or, or leave the club now
Do like I did, come back when u get dough
A fishstick nigga now we messing with lobsters
We messin' with Grammies, we messin' with Oscars
You messin' with that dranky drank
Plus you puffin' on that stanky stank
In the morning you gon' draw a blank
The hotel said y'all was on 'em
My girl wasn't on shit, I picked the wrong one
Steady talkin' bout I ain't like them other girls
Well tonight I'm tryin' to find them other girls
Bring they own rubber girl
Never meet ya mother girl
You know they love it when you love 'em
And they tell they friends girl

[Hook x2 (with ad-libs from Kanye West)]

[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx]
Can I, can I, save you from you?
Cause you know there's somethin' missin'
And the champagne that you been sippin'
Not supposed to make you different all the time
Starting to feel, like the wrong thing to do girl
Cause with all that recognition, it gets hard for you to listen
To the things that I'mma say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I've found one
Making the mistake I never learned from

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
I swear I, al-ways, fall, for your type
Yeah, for your type
Tell me why I, al-ways, fall, for your type?
For your type

[Post-Hook: Drake & Jamie Foxx]
I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I believe in people like you

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
So who am I to judge you on the past girl?
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothin' like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me
Down right now, it's too late
I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
I swear I, al-ways, fall, for your type
Yeah, for your type
Tell me why I, al-ways, fall, for your type?
For your type

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, yeah, uh, look
Dress hangin' off your shoulder, barely sober
Tellin' me how you movin' away and startin' over
Girl quit playin' you just drunk, you just sayin' shit
And oh you dance? Dance like how? Like ballet and shit?
Oh, wait, no I get it girl, I'm wit it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn, I wonder why I never learned my lesson
It's feeling like ya second chance and it's the first impression
And I heard there's nothin' new except for someone new
But how you s'posed to find the one when anyone'll come with you?
Talkin' to myself but I never listened
Cause man it's been a while and I swear that this one's different
That's why I'ma take you anyway you wanna go, let you meet my friends
So they can lecture me again about how reckless I have been
And I'm slowly runnin' out of all the time that I invested
Makin' all the same mistakes and I'm just tryin' to correct it
And I fall

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
I swear I, al-ways, fall, for your type
Yeah, for your type
Tell me why I, al-ways, fall, for your type?
For your type

[Post-Hook: Drake & Jamie Foxx]
I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I just can't explain this shit at all
Fall for your type
I believe in people like you

Mary J, Pete Rock, C.L

[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
The way I let it
Loose, for real, could only boost, the deal
The bigger the flip, the better it feel
Ladies up shakin', doin' they dance, hands in the air
When Mary drop, it's nothin' but a family affair
Now once you got C.L. poppin', baby, ain't no stoppin'
It's all gravy, once you got the whole hood coppin'
With the queen on my lap with some new paper
Daddy, it's a rap

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Come on, everybody, get on up
Cause you know we gots to get it crunk
Mary J is in the spot tonight
And I'm a make you feel alright
Come on, baby, just party with me
Let loose and set your body free
Leave your situations at the door
So when you step inside, jump on the floor

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Let's get it crunk up on
Have fun up on up in this dancery
We got ya open, now ya floatin'
So you gots to dance for me
Don't need no hateration
Holleration in this dancery
Let's get it percolatin', while you're waiting
So just dance for me

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige & Pete Rock]
It's only gonna be about a matter of time
Before you get loose and start to lose your mind
Cop you a drink, go ahead and rock your ice
Cause were celebratin', no more drama in our life
Get the… remix… pumpin', everybody's jumpin'
Go ahead and twist your back, and get your body bumpin'
I told you, leave your situations at the door
So grab somebody, and get your ass on the dance floor

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Let's get it crunk up on
Have fun up on up in this dancery
We got ya open, now ya floatin'
So you gots to dance for me

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige & Pete Rock]
We, don't need, no haters

We just want y'all to have a good time
No more drama in your life

Let's have fun tonight, no fights
Turn that… remix… way up high
Making you dance all night and I
Got some real heat for ya this time
Doesn't matter if you white or black
Let's get crunk cause Mary back

[Verse 4: C.L. Smooth]
I'd probably boot these thoroughbreds and bully the draw
Step up in the club, and all they wanna start is the biddin' wars
Compared to the young C.L. A much more ruthless
Muck more richer, but it's a family affair
Then I guess I'm just that much more sicker
Cigar blowin', champagne flowin', be easy
Like movin' units is nothin' further that could please me
But how ya marinate my check late with M.J.B

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Let's get it crunk up on
Have fun up on up in this dancery
We got ya open, now ya floatin'
So you gots to dance for me
Don't need no hateration
Holleration in this dancery
Let's get it percolatin', while you're waiting
So just dance for me
Let's get it crunk up on
Have fun up on up in this dancery
We got ya open, now ya floatin'
So you gots to dance for me
Don't need no hateration
Holleration in this dancery
Let's get it percolatin', while you're waiting
So just dance for me

When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face

I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of fears that were holding me
My endless possibility has the whole world opened for me
That's why...

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm feeling so good (Feeling good)
I knew that I would (I knew I would)
Been taking care of myself like I should (Been taking care of myself)
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down (I don't think, bring me down)
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around

[Verse 4: Jennifer Lopez]
Now the day is turning into night
And everything is still going right
There's no way you can stop me this time
Or break this spirit of mine, oh, no

Anything I want will be mine
Tonight, I'm gonna have a good time
Call a few friends of mine
'Cause I'm loving life, and tonight's for feeling

[Verse 5: Big Punisher & Fat Joe]
Boricua, that's you mamacita
Puerto Rican diva from La Isla Bonita
Let me freak ya on the dance floor
Lead your mans off, he just tryna get your pants off
That's the last straw, Pun, I ain't got a glass jaw
Better run when you see me coming through the back door
Crack's raw, I give it all for my brother
Two things I don't share, that's my money and my lover
I know money's just for caring, that's for real
Take's cash to live (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You love her? Better scrap, for real
Shut up your grill
You know we never fight
It's your world, girl, set it off right

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm feeling so good (Feeling good)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z (R. Kelly)]
After the show it's the after party then
After the party it's the hotel lobby and
After the Belve' then it's probably Cris'
And after the original it's probably this (fiesta)
Yes ma, Bed-Stuy, Fiesta
Remix with the homie from the Midwest side (Chi, what)
Game recognize game, hoes do too
It's the new 2 Live Crew, I suppose you knew
So thugs, pop yo' toasters, but don't approach us or
Bullets'll chase you like Moët mimosas
Catch us both coasts-es, racing twin Porsches
Boxes with Glocks that'll pop ya to make ya ghost-es
Whoever come closest - you've been warned
But niggas don't get the picture 'til the weapons is drawn
Make your way backstage, baby girl it's on
And we'll be drinking 'til six in the morning

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
In the back of the club with ma-ma
Popping bottles of Cris' with ma-ma
Put the bar on the tab for ma-ma
Throwing hundreds up for grabs for ma-ma
'Cause it's about to go down tonight
I'ma be drinking 'til the early liz-ight (that's right)
Nigga high like a muh'fucking ki-zite
Take three honies just to make me feel ri-zight
My, my, my, my
It's what they all say when they see the frozen ice
They say - my, my, my, my
Anytime they see them big things rolling b-zy

[Breakdown: R. Kelly]
While y'all gotta club date, I'm fucking with arenas
Gotcha man saying "Kelly have you seen her?"
Yeah she with me on the low
Getting high off the 'dro, got her knees on the flo'
Fiesta!

[Chorus: R. Kelly & (Tone)]
Fiesta, Fiesta (fiesta)
Fiesta, Fiesta (fiesta)

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Switching lanes in my six, in the 'burbs
I met a girl named Tasha, in the 'burbs
Took the hood then I moved it, to the 'burbs
Now no more sheriffs or polices, in the 'burbs (that's right)
And we about to tear this club up
Don't worry 'bout expenses 'cause I got that sho' nuff
Ready to BOO knock 'em fresh outta jizzail
I need some WOO from all the honies on the DL
I said - my, my, my, my (yeah)
It's what them thugs yelling when the strippers on the pi-zoles
They say - my, my, my, my (yeah)
Got Kisha yelling from that up and down shi-zow (mami)

[Breakdown: R. Kelly]
While y'all gotta club date, I'm fucking with arenas
Gotcha man saying "Kelly have you seen her?"
Yeah she with me on the low
Getting high off the 'dro, got her knees on the flo'
Fiesta!

[Verse 4: Gotti]
I put the big body up, come through in a Rover
Not only Kelly and Gotti, it's Boo and Hova
Pop Cris if you like, my ice glist' in the light
I'm with Rockland right, so I'm rich for life
I'm like Heaven, everybody wanna get to me
How you make it to the gates and forget the key?
I'm the one God chose so you blessed through me
Gotti Floyd getchu higher than that ecstacy

[Verse 5: Boo & (R. Kelly)]
Ayo, I come through stunning, plus I'm getting blunted
In the new six-hundred with the big rims on it
We rock rocks that'll light ya shoulders
Gotta lotta hot cars but the drops is colder (aahh)
You see V-I-P; me, Kelly, Gotti, and Hov'
Drinking Cris' like it's H-2-O
All we do is spend cheese 'cause we love the dough
Mami roll more trees 'fore it's time to go
C'mon

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
If you got cash money then you feel this shit
And if you rolling on them things then you feel this shit
If you drunk off in the club then you feel this shit
If you see a motherfucking thug then you feel this shit
If you smoking on some 'dro then you feel this shit
And if you off that Ecstasy you gots to feel this shit
If you sipping on some Cris' you gots to feel this shit
And if you throwing up and shit, you gots to feel this shit
Fiesta..

[Intro: R. Kelly]
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
I'm a flirt
Soon as I see her walk up in the club, I'm a flirt
Winking eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs, I'm a flirt
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low, I'm a flirt
And when she's with her man looking at me damn right, I'm a flirt
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me 'cause, I'm a flirt
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause, I'm a flirt
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me because, I'm a flirt

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Now swear to tell the truth and the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimping like I supposed to
Rolling like I supposed to, shining like I supposed to
In the club fucking with honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand when a nigga bring his girlfriend to the club
Freaking all on the floor with his girlfriend in the club
And wonder why all these playas trying to holler at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga I'm gon' holler at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walking through the mall
If I could man I probably would fuck with all of y'all
Yeah, yeah homie you say she your girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'ma be like cousin
Believe me man this is how them playas do it in the Chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the Chi
Now the moral of this story is cuff your bitch
'Cause hey, I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich and I'm a flirt

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Hey homie if you ain't got no money
You better keep her away from me, ya dig?...
Well if ya love ya girl and wanna keep ya girl
Don't be walkin' up and askin' me to meet ya girl
Because I'm well known to flirt when I speak to ya girl
She winked her eyes on the sly, I seen cha girl
Better treat girl right cause another man will
Better eat ya girl like another man will
'Cause you leave ya wife and I see ya wife now be for real
How long ya think that's fixin' to be ya wife?
Well I'm living the life, you just getting it right
Ya old lady look at me 'cause you ain't hitting it right
She probably used to like you cause you the business type
But that's 'til I came along and put some dick in her life
Wanna see how that ass looking thick in the light
That's when I noticed she was checking me and digging the ice
And if I get that tonight bet I hit that twice
I can even make her mine if I hit that right
You know, smack that thang
Sit that right up on that dresser, yeah that's right
Pulling on her hair like we getting in a fight
Yeah, I know it's kind of tight but it'll sweat just right
So if ya girl sexy and she test me
Don't be upset G 'cause you might catch me
Trying to catch a glance up her skirt, the McLaren in reverse
If I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
When I, when I, when I...
When I pull up to club all the shorties be like, "Damn twenty-eights"
Then I be like "girl you know just who I am, don't hate"
See I done Fell in Love with a Stripper y'all
All I do is flirt with her and I get them draws
And I don't need no help, I got it down pat
Teddy Pain was born to flirt now you can't down that
Now I'ma flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town
That's why they call me Teddy Bend-Er-Ass-Down
I be like "Como se llama, lil' mama? Me llamo Pain
What is your name? I'm feeling your vibe and I'm hoping you feel the same"
I'ma wink my eye and let you know I got the game
When I pass by I know exactly what you say
"He's so fly, yes he's so cool"
Hey shorty, hey shorty what it do
He mad 'cause I'm looking but I already fucked her
I got these niggas mad 'cause I'm a flirt

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
I'm a flirt
Soon as I see her walk up in the club, I'm a flirt
Winking eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs, I'm a flirt
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low, I'm a flirt
And when she's with her man looking at me damn right, I'm a flirt
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me 'cause, I'm a flirt
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause, I'm a flirt
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me because, I'm a flirt

[Verse 4: R. Kelly]
Oh, it's, the, re-mix...
Now if you walk in up in the club with a bad chick
And if she looking at me then I'm gon' hit
Man jacking for chicks, I tried to quit it
But I'm a playa homie so I had to hit it
While you buying her drinks in the club, acting like you in love
Stunting like you all thug, we was switching numbers
She looking at you and I walk by
You turn your head, she wink her eye
I can't help it if she checking for a platinum type of guy
She be calling me daddy, I be calling her mommy
She be calling you Kelly when your name is Tommy
I don't know what y'all be thinking when you bring 'em around me
Let me remind you that I am the king of R&B
Do you know what that means? That means if you love your chick
Don't bring her to the V.I.P cause I might leave with your chick
Just keeping it real my nigga, it's a playa's field my nigga
Don't take no bitch to the club when you just met her my nigga
'Cause I'ma flirt with her, right, he gon' flirt with her, right
And if she lickin' that good shit, she gon' flirt with her

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
I'm a flirt
Soon as I see her walk up in the club, I'm a flirt
Winking eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs, I'm a flirt
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low, I'm a flirt
And when she's with her man looking at me damn right, I'm a flirt
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me 'cause, I'm a flirt
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause, I'm a flirt
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her

Mr. Biggs, you know you got to keep me jigs
Mr. Biggs

[Chorus: 112]
Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)
Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)

[Verse 1: Ronald Isley & Angela Winbush]
Can't get you off of my mind
Girl, I've been thinking of you
So let's not waste our time
Tell me what you want to do
Your body's hot for mine
Girl, let me hold you real tight
Don't rush lets take our time
I wanna love you all night
You know just what to do
Go down and taste my love
I'll do the same for you
You know what I'm thinking of
Tonight I'm gonna cry
Until I'm soaking wet
Do every thing you like
Baby, comfort me

[Chorus: 112]
Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)
Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)

[Verse 2: Ronald Isley & Angela Winbush]
Don't wanna stop this groove
Just wanna keep goin on
The way your body moves
Oh girl I can't let you go
Just let me come inside
Until you can't take no more
You're body wrapped on mine
Now baby, let me explode

You gotta give me some more
I love the way it feels
The way you caress me
Take me to ecstasy
Oh baby, up and down
Just hit it all around
This love it feels so right
Bring it and hold me too

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
Lil' Kim, you don't know what type of chick this is
Number one ballette of the mistresses
Mr. Biggs, you know you got to keep me jigs
Even though it might mean stealing chips from kids (Say what!)
You know I sail the coast, too hot for mink coats
Get C-notes every time I deep throats
Ya losing it, acting like ya new to this
Get true to this, make it shift in my uterus
Sexing in the Aston Martin
When wifey comes home, get the dough and I'm departing
I wanna see if you can make me scream I hate ya
Give me back shots and sweat out my cream of nature

[Bridge: 112]
Don't you stop (Don't stop)
Just give it to me (Give to me)
I need release (I need release, whoa)
Love me here, touch me there
This love is ours, something to share

[Chorus: 112]
Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)
Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)
Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)
Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)
Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)

[R. Kelly]
Gotham City for the ghetto, ghetto...
Gotham City for the ghetto, ghetto...

[R. Kelly talking]
Uh yo yo, everybody's talkin' about the good ol' days, the good ol' days
Everybody's talkin' about the good ol' days (I remember)
Ha, I remember when me and my brother used to sit up on the porch
In the summertime and just talk about.. just makin' it
Know what I'm sayin' bein' successful and followin' after dreams
And uh.. I believe that's every kids dream, ya know what I'm sayin'
To rise and be somebody but damn sometimes we just get caught up...

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
I ain't got no money and I ain't got no friends
Looks like my world is comin' to an end
No food on the table, no clothes on my back
No shoes on my feet and I just barely gotta used Cadillac
Now ain't that ghetto for ya
But some how it's got to change yeah, ghetto for ya
So I took this remix and rearranged Gotham City, city of love
(City of love), a city of peace for everyone of us (For everyone of us)
Cause we all need it, can't live without it (Can't live without it)
Gotham City for the ghetto, yeah

[Verse 2: Strings]
Gotham City for the ghetto, that's what I'm talkin' about...
Ghetto fabulous, to a nigga health be hazardous
If you wanna test wrath in us, for the respect
S-T-R-I-N-G-S, yes, fuck the rest
Give me the best, why should I have to settle for less
When I could push V-12's in finesse
Wha-wha whew and all that mess
You can try to hold me back but I
Keep on truckin' till I hit the sky
Even if you wanted to ya can't deny
Gotta feed baby girl, do or die

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
We keep talkin' about escalating (Escalating), well who's gonna go first
Guess I'll be the one to step up
If you don't follow me it would be the worst
Every time something goes down, somebody's cryin' ghetto tears
Hope I'm not rainin' on your parade
But this is not what's keepin' it real is, now ain't that ghetto for ya
But some how it's got to change yeah, ghetto for ya
So I took this remix and rearranged a Gotham City
City of love (Uh huh, uh, huh, uh huh)
A city of peace, for every one of us, oh yeah (That's right)
Cause we all need it, can't live without it, oh yeah yeah
A Gotham City for the ghetto

[Verse 4: Strings]
Uh, uh, uh check it out
Now motherfucker wanna act surprised
Cause you afraid to change and scared to rise
That's why ya ass gettin' left behind
Nigga outta sight, nigga outta mind
Cause ain't nobody gonna stop the dream
Talk that shit, lock my cream
Negativity ya got to let it go
Havin' Gotham City free ya soul

[R. Kelly]
And we all need it, hey hey hey
Gotham City for the ghetto (Gotham City for the ghetto)
Yeah (That's right) uh hmmm
Callin' on Heaven
Send yo love down to the ghetto, uh hmm
Talkin' about a land where, oh yeah
Where there will be no more cryin'
No more cryin' no, oh yeah
A place where we can all just get along, yeah
And children will sing ghetto love songs (Sing y'all and smile)
And a land where, city of love
And a land where, for every one of us

[Intro: Crucial Conflict & R. Kelly]
Crucial Conflict come out and play
Hey, come on, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Crucial Conflict, Kelly and Rockland, collabo'
Ooh, ooh, yeah

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Funny faces is all I see
At my place, you on top of me
Playin' strip poker, sippin' Cristi'
I grip your shoulders, you sqeeze the sheets
I'm admirin' your heart shaped booty
Nothin' in your oven, baby feed me now
Who's is this, who's is this, who's is this?
Who's is this, who's is this, who's is this?
My ghetto queen

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
You're my ghetto queen
Right around the way from me
Watering those ghetto trees
We be high just like them weeds

[Verse 2: Crucial Conflict]
Might be ghetto but you queen to me
That's how it's suppose to be
Do whatcha gotta do for me
Forever fulfill your fantasy
When you think of me, have your cream
Everything my team must to do one thing
You're the meanest queen on the scene
Make a player 'fien and be havin' dreams
For real, it's real as it seems
You bring the trees, I'll bring the B's
Begin to freeze on to me, you can scream to please
Plus I'm ready now, take a stand, got me on Rockland
I can be your freaky man, you can climb in, suck a 10
Want some ends? You outta there
No more funny face, put you in your place
Come be the dinner, I'ma bring a plate

[Verse 3: Crucial Conflict]
She's my ghetto girl in her own world, she's a queen
Queen of all things, for that I mean she's Spring
Personality rings bells in my dreams
Night to dawn, light spread tight, let's swing
Grip it in motion, wet coastin' with a little bit of ridin' rough
Up and down we stroke, strokin' puttin' things in her pocket is fat
But watch her stay cool, calm and collected
Flexin', check it, never was on that stressin'
'Cause she bring that hay for the day, what a blessin'
Right around the way from me
This ghetto queen got up with a king
Keep it clean and in essence

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
You're my ghetto queen
Right around the way from me
Watering those ghetto trees
We be high just like them weeds
You're my ghetto queen
Right around the way from me
Watering those ghetto trees
We be high just like them weeds

[Verse 4: Kilo]
Where the players live
Have to deal with the Macks
Like the traps in the concrete jungle
Life's a safari in the mornin' huntin'
In effect, your pulse beatin' like bongos
We be like this, gettin' high
Ghetto queen you look so delightin'
Heard your body callin', callin' me, baby
Tellin' me to rodeo ride it
Don't fall off, hold on
Get your roll on, step aside, hugged her back
She swore she wouldn't do me, need your loyalty
You're makin' me wantin' to snap
I know your man is mad as hell
'Cause it to a player and I did it well
And I added one more for the road, to let 'em know
Kilo weigh heavy on the scale, mmm

[Verse 5: Wyldstyle]
Dedicated to my ghetto queens in jeans
That think they're mean
I'll massage you with whip cream
I wanna spread you legs and said you were my lady
Down with me, clown with me, fall to the ground with me
Lovin' how you sound when we get 'em off
Carry on to the dawn, give a dog a bone (lick 'em low)
Rodeo show, duckin' you, buckin' in the back of a Cadillac
Tell me if you want it like that (let's bang)
Got me tweakin' Mary Jane, it's a hay thang
Me and you, everyday keep it high like flames (your game)
What's my name? What's my name?
It's Wyldstyle from Chitown, no shame
Me and the ghetto queen comin' up the main
Switchin' four lanes, to the airplane
Sky high we fly when we roll by
On the down low, doin' my thang man

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
You're my ghetto queen
Right around the way from me
Watering those ghetto trees
We be high just like them weeds
You're my ghetto queen
Right around the way from me
Watering those ghetto trees
We be high just like them weeds

[Bridge: Crucial Conflict & R. Kelly]
Crucial Conflict, Kelly, and Rockland, collabo'
Crucial Conflict, Kelly, and Rockland, collabo'

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
You're my ghetto queen
Right around the way from me
Watering those ghetto trees
We be high just like them weeds
You're my ghetto queen (my ghetto queen, oh yeah)
Right around the way from me
Watering those ghetto trees
We be high just like them weeds
You're my ghetto queen (my ghetto queen, love it when you get freaky)
Right around the way from me
Watering those ghetto trees (oh yeah)
We be high just like them weeds (my ghetto queen)
You're my ghetto queen
Right around the way from me
Watering those ghetto trees
We be high just like them weeds
You're my ghetto queen
Right around the way from me
Watering those ghetto trees
We be high just like them weeds

[Verse 1]
Deceitful eyes, she's got those come get me thighs
She only knows how low that she can go
She speaks the lines that can control my mind
Wherever she goes I know my eyes follow
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant
Only for me, then spoke with her body
Her only goal is just to take control
And I can't believe  that I can´t tell her no

[Chorus]
That girl I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker

[Verse 2]
She plays a game with such an innocent face
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case
Her actions confess and put me through the test
I was surprised that I was caught inside
Now she's thinking that I will never know
And she'll keep playing until I let her go
But I hope in time that she will finally realize
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same

[Chorus]
That girl I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker

[Bridge]
I never thought that I would stop dreaming about you
Stop being without you
But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you
And start being without you
But I’ll find a way to go and start doing without you
And stop talking about you
And what will she say?
She will say I was the man that got away

[Rap: Fats]
You playing, huh?
I thought it was love with this game, huh?
When your dealing with the emotions of pain, huh?
Take a closer look when your dealing with a stranger
I can't change her, no
Heart murder in place then you'll see
A one hill from Pepsi, they see
One hard player, she's a star player
I need this crap, huh?
I didn't see the heartbreaker, so come on

[Chorus]
That girl I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker

[Like a Virgin]

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was until I found you
I was beat, incomplete, I'd been had
I was sad and blue, but you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel shiny and new, oh

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera,  Britney & Christina]
Like a virgin (Ooh)
Touched for the very first time (Oh)
Like a virgin, ha!

Oh, oh, yeah
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh

[Intro: Usher]
He said, "You swear to tell the truth
The whole truth, and nothing but the truth?"
I said, "Yeah, man
Right hand high, never tell a lie"

[Verse 1: Usher]
Y-Y-Your Honor, I didn't know that I hurt her
I didn't know she was crying
I didn't know that it was killing me slow
And-And your honor, she can't say I ain't love her
Can't say I ain't try
But I guess my love wasn't good enough

[Chorus: Usher]
I guess I'm guilty for wanting to be up in the club
I guess I'm guilty 'cause girls always wanna show me love
I guess I'm guilty for living and having a little fun
Well, I'm guilty, for that, girl, I'm guilty
Don't take me to jail, don't take me to jail
Don't take me to jail
(I ain't did nothing to her, gave everything to her
For that)
Don't take me to jail, don't take me to jail (take me)
Don't take me to jail
(I ain't done a crime, why you make me do the time?)

[Verse 2: Usher]
Your Honor, she accused me of cheating
It was all in her thinking
She gon' believe what she want to
So what the hell am I gon' do?
Turn my life around, it ain't going down
She knew 'bout the life that I live, why she crying now?
This shit is so silly to me, but I won't plead that

[Chorus: Usher]
I guess I'm guilty for wanting to be up in the club
I guess I'm guilty 'cause girls always wanna show me love
I guess I'm guilty for living and having a little fun
Well, I'm guilty, for that, girl, I'm guilty
Don't take me to jail, don't take me to jail (take me)
Don't take me to jail
(How we supposed to get along with her going through my phone?
In her mind, she decided I did it)
Don't take me to jail (don't take me)
Don't take me to jail (don't take me)
Don't take me to jail
(Don't wanna cop a plea, I swear it wasn't me
It don't matter 'cause to her, I'm guilty)

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Let's go, right hand to the sky, strike me down if I lie
If she saying she the victim in this case, well, what am I?
If I hurt her, I ain't try to, the club I may decide to
Ride through, she got proof? Well, I got alibis too
A couple million dollar worth of bags and full of shoes
Seven-carat solitaire, Caribbean, water blue
Range Rover, Porsche Panamera, and the Bentley Coupe
All the shit I did for her and this who you gon' listen to?
And her life, I submit to you as evidence, I never been on bullshit
She ain't caught me on no Tiger Woods shit
Knew what I expected when she met me, should have left me then
Balling against the law? Shorty, go on and arrest me then

[Chorus: Usher]
I guess I'm guilty for wanting to be up in the club
I guess I'm guilty 'cause girls always wanna show me love
I guess I'm guilty for living and having a little fun
Well, I'm guilty, for that, girl, I'm guilty
Don't take me to jail, don't take me to jail (take me)
Don't take me to jail
(If you gon' treat me like a crook, putting money on my books
Never mind, forget it)
Don't take me to jail, don't take me to jail (take me)
Don't take me to jail
(Tired of your little games, fuck it, I'll take the blame
I did it, guilty)

The lyrical genius with the R&B messiah
And the roof, the roof we sets on fire

With they hands in the air bringing in the new year
Yeah, ayo, come on

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Hey yo nephew check this out man
Now I know you got that bad chick right there
You ain't even tripping off of her
But she doing all of that for you
She got this, she got that, man she's off the hizzle
I mean when you find one like that
You got to make that change man
'Cause they don't come too often
And when they do come
You gotta be smart enough to know when to change
Like Sam Cooke say, change gon' come nephew
And you better believe that

[Verse 1: John Legend]
As I look back on all that I've done to you
My biggest regrets, the things that I never could do
I see the light now baby it's shining through
Gotta give up the game, yeah I got some changin' to do

[Bridge 1: John Legend]
I won't get high if you want it, get that straight
9 to 5 if you want it
Keep my ass home at night if you want it
Whatever you need me to do
When you talk, I'ma listen
Give you all that attention you missin'
Girl I swear I'ma handle my business
Just like a real man should do

[Chorus: John Legend]
I can change, I can change (you know I can change baby)
I can change for you (you know I can stop baby)
I can change, (you know I can change baby) I can change
I can change for you (you know I can stop baby)

[Verse 2: John Legend]
I'll give up all the places I used to go
Stay out the club, stay home because I'm with you
I'll give up all those girls that I used to know
They don't compare, baby I swear it's the truth
(you know it's the truth baby)

[Bridge 2: John Legend]
So I'm through with the women
Yeah that's right, I give up on the pimpin'
Girl I'm gonna repent from my sinnin'
If that's what you want me to do
I'll get right if you want it
Go to church
Get baptized if you want it
Girl you opened my eyes and I'm gonna
Be much better for you
(Baby believe me, baby believe me)

[Chorus: John Legend]
I can change, I can change (you know I can change baby)
I can change for you (you know I can stop baby)
I can change, (you know I change baby) I can change
I can change for you (you know I can stop baby)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Take me to the river and baptize my soul
I'm so outta control, needing someone to hold
Man it's cold
I ain't been clubbin', drinkin', or smokin'
I'm focused, bowin' down every night prayin' and hopin'
I'm trying to figure out a way
But I just don't know how to say
But I'm rearrangin', hopefully I'm changin'
And you can see that baby 'cause it's hard for me
Kinda sorta odd for me, but ain't nothing to it
If you need me to do it I guess...

[Spoken: Snoop Dogg] + 

[Chorus]
Yea, I'm willin' to make that change baby
I'm willin' to make that change
I mean, outta all the people in the word
Who would've thought that the big boss dog
Would be willin' to make that change?
Yeah, you special baby, you real special
You get in the pimp and leave all these minks and his cat links and all that behind
All for you, nobody but you
I'm so serious about it, I can change
But only for you
Cause you the type of female, that, you know what I'm sayin'
You bring that out of a playa
Make me wanna lay down the pippin' and step my love game up
Can ya dig that? Yea, on some Romeo and Juliet, ha ha
I can change baby, gimme the room
I can make your zoom zoom go boom boom!
This is legendary shit right here, baby

[Outro]
Gotta believe me (you gotta believe me baby)
Gotta believe me (mmm yeah)
I'm telling the truth

Get baptized if you want it
This time I mean it

Gotta believe me (this time I mean it)
Gotta believe me
I'm telling the truth

[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Yo!
I'm sick of this, man
I can't even take no more
'Cause I hate the fact that I love you so much
And you know what I'm saying?
You don't even understand what this is doing to me
Every time I try to get away, I just can't let you go
You know what I'm saying?
I just can't let you go!

[Verse 1: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
I never ever wanna hurt you, I just wanna love ya
I just wanna sex you up
I wanna give you everything you need, -thing you want
Just lay down and let me love you all night long
It was beautiful when we first started
I don't wanna leave you, I just wanna keep you
When they saw me, they saw you
Damn the world, it's just me and my girl
That's how I felt
Every time I thought it was right, it went left

[Chorus: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
We used to laugh and party
Now all we do is argue (what happened to all the good times?!)
I tell myself that I don't want you no more (girl)
But I can't let you go (you see, I can't let you go!)
So much love and hurt and hate (I hate this!)
People screaming it won't work
Time and time, I say I'm gonna leave (see what I'm saying?!]
But I can't let you go

[Break: Jermaine Dupri]
Now you wanna be real insensitive and try to act kinda funny, man
You know what, man?!
You ain't even gotta wait till in the morning, man
You can get out of here tonight, man
Hey, yo, Glen, come grab her shit and get her out of here!

[Verse 2: Usher]
Baby, you ain't even gotta like me, but you're not gonna fight me
You can't walk away and say
I never gave you everything want, -thing ya need
All we ever do is argue all night long
I don't wanna leave you
See you with another brother loving you
Saying "damn the world, it's me and my girl"
That's how I feel when you think everything is real
But it really ain't

[Chorus: Usher]
We used to laugh and party
Now all we do is argue
I tell myself that I don't want you no more
But I can't let you go
So much love and hurt and hate
People screaming it won't work
Time and time, I say I'm gonna leave
But I can't let you go
We used to laugh and party
Now all we do is argue
I tell myself that I don't want you no more
But I can't let you go
So much love and hurt and hate
People screaming it won't work
Time and time, I say I'm gonna leave
But I can't let you go

[Verse 3: Jermaine Dupri]
Got me walking around, ready to snap
Got me walking around, looking for somebody to slap
Got me going, going with no pause
Got me up in Cartier everyday just 'cause
Got me arguing about little stuff she don't call little stuff
It get a little rough, then we kiss and make up
She wanna say what she wanna, I don't play that
She wanna constantly bring up shit from way back
Got me thinking about her while I'm watching a flick
Got me dipping through traffic, trying to get home quick
Got me talking to myself, I'm hating this
Got me wanting to wild out like I'm Jadakiss
Got me in a place I never thought I would see
Got me not wanting to stay, not wanting to leave
Got me happy, got me confused
Got me wishing I could get it how I used to

[Chorus: Usher]
We used to laugh and party
Now all we do is argue
I tell myself that I don't want you no more
But I can't let you go
So much love and hurt and hate
People screaming it won't work
Time and time, I say I'm gonna leave
But I can't let you go
We used to laugh and party
Now all we do is argue
I tell myself that I don't want you no more
But I can't let you go
So much love and hurt and hate
People screaming it won't work
Time and time, I say I'm gonna leave
But I can't let you go

[Outro: Ying Yang Twins]
Hey
Yup!

[Intro: Jennifer Lopez & (50 Cent)]
Oh yes
(Uh-huh, yes)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I want to be the reason you smile after you wipe your tears
The reason you have the courage to confront your fears (Woo!)
The reason there's two karats in each your ears
I sperge with the paper, ma, I don't care
How you like the pumps, boots, Jeeps, coupes?
Make celebs, 50 fall off never
What's mines is yours and what's yours is mine
So when I shinin', you shine
Come on, the finest champagne, we can toast to life
Crap table in Vegas, you can toss the dice
Don't let your friends get you confused sayin' 50 bad news
I need you in my life, girl, you're too much to lose (Yeah!)

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me this ain't right
Don't you know he's not for you?
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
'Cause I love you, I just tried to stay

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (I'ma be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you?
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize that I can't change you

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Ooh)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (Be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did it)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & 50 Cent]
Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay (Days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need (Need to do) to do to be okay (For me to be okay)
Never thought it would be true (Would be true)
Me living without you (Living without you, yeah)
But now it's time for me to make that move (Uh-huh, yeah)
Oh woah

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Now when I tell you what my wishes are, you don't respect it
When I smile at you, you don't smile back to reconnect it
You ain't even gone long but I already miss you (Yeah!)
I need you next to me so I can hug you and kiss you
All the talking on the phone, all the time we shared
How could you fix your mouth to say I don't care?
I had plans for us to buy ice together
Engagement rings and things and share life together (Woo!)
Now when your friends tell you 50 called you like whatever
Do you think we were wrong for each other from the start?
Or was it my actions that made us fall apart?
Just want you to know you'll always have a place in my heart

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (But I did, baby)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Wasn't with it)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it (To my eyes)
And I know inside I'ma be alright (Be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (But I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Wasn't with it)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Interlude: Jennifer Lopez]
Oh, no
Be alright, yes
Oh, no
Says I'm gonna be alright

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright
I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Intro]
Uh, what?
Uh, uh, uh
Let's go

[Verse 1]
Called you on the phone, said I'm coming through
Hope you're all alone, 'cause I got plans for you
We could stay at home or dance and hang all night
As long as I'm with you, doesn't matter what we do

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't ask me where I've been
Or what I'm gonna do, just know that I'm here with you
Don't try to understand
Baby, there's no mystery, 'cause you know how I am

[Chorus (Diddy)]
I'm real (Real)
What you get is what you see (Yeah)
What you tryna to do to me?
You wanna say you're mine
Be with me all the time (Be with me all the time)
You're falling so in love (Oh yeah)
Say you just can't get enough
You're telling all your friends
(She's a bad, bad bitch)

[Interlude]
Woo! Oh, come on
Huh!
In the pocket, yeah

[Verse 2]
You like the way I dress, the way I wear my hair
Show me off to all your friends, and baby, I don't care
Just as long as you tell them who I am
Tell them I'm the one that made you give a damn

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't ask me where I've been
Or what I'm gonna do, just know that I'm here with you
Don't try to understand
Baby, there's no mystery, 'cause you know how I am

[Chorus (Diddy)]

(She's a bad, bad bitch)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus (Diddy)]

[Bridge]

[Chorus (Diddy)]

[Intro]
Well, well, uh
Well, well, uh

[Verse 1]
If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
But, girl, you just won't approve of the things that I do
When all I do is for you, but still you say it ain't cool

[Pre-Chorus]
If there's somebody else (He can't love you like me)
And he, and he says he'll treat you well (He can't treat you like me)
And he's buying diamonds and pearls (He can't do it like me)
And he's taking you all across the world (He can't trick you like me)

[Chorus]
So why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible
I can't do anything
She's invincible
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible
Girl won't give in to me
She's in-, she's invincible

[Post-Chorus]
Well, well, see
Well, well
Come on now, oh

[Verse 2]
Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me, how does it seem that you ain't checking for me?
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream

[Pre-Chorus]
And if there's somebody else (He can't love you like me)
And he, he says he'll treat you well (He can't treat you like me)
And he's buying diamonds and pearls (He can't do it like me)
And he's taking you all across the world (He can't trick you like me)

[Chorus]
Why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Come on now)
I can't do anything
She's invincible
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible (Come on now)
Girl won't give in to me
She's in-, she's invincible

[Bridge]
Now some way I'll have to prove all that I said I would do
Giving you everything, fulfilling your fantasy
Then maybe you'll change your mind and finally give in time
Then I'll be showing you what other men are supposed
To do for you, my baby

[Verse 3: Fats, Michael Jackson]
Yo, mami, stop the frontin', I'm real with mine
All the things that I promised, I'll fulfill in time
Chains and the bracelet, got the realest shine
So many trips, y'all have jetlag and still be fine (Come on now)
You can trip, but this money ain't long enough
He can spit, but his game ain't strong enough
Now the way you resisting, this ain't cool
It's like nothing seems to work, she's invincible

[Chorus]
Why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Come on now)
I can't do anything
She's invincible (Come on now)
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible (Come on now)
That girl won't give in to me
She's invincible (Oh)
Can you feel me?
She's invincible (Oh, yeah)
She's invincible
She's invincible (Yeah, now you tell me, baby)
Are you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Yeah)
You see the girl won't give in to me
She's invincible (Yeah, yeah, hey)
She's invincible (Hey)
Hee-hee
She's invincible (Hey)
She's invincible (Ooh)
She's in-, she's invincible

[Outro]
Why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Come on now)
I can't do anything
She's invincible (Come on now)
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible (Come on now)
That girl won't give in to me
She's in-, she's invincible (Yeah, yeah)

[Prodigy]
First of all we the one and only
Infamous and Mary Blige
Coming straight, ghetto poetry
And ain't nothing changed but the size of the money
I'm still that same 'g'
Can you say the same thing?

[Havoc]
Must be blind to the fact Mary Queen on the wax
We the kings on the streets
Ain't know where your heart at, look inside
And you'll find a entertainer, one of a kind
That's way ahead of her time
Take a look

[Mary]
Oh I need to know
If you can get into my mind
Stimulate it
Give me good love all the time
Or are you just another man
Who's after me for all my paper
Looking for a ride that's free
1 -	

[Mary]
	Deep inside I wish you'd see
	That I'm just plain old Mary
	Deep inside I wish you'd see
	That I'm just plain old, plain old Mary J. Blige

[Mary]
Now you see for seven years I lived life openly
So it's hard to find someone who really knows me
So I say these things just so that you can know
That you can't be with me
If you're trying to change my flow

[Mary]
Now if you take away the house
And you take away the clothes I wear
And you take away the diamonds
I'mma still be standing here
And if you take away the voice and the money
I will always be my nigga's favorite honey
And if you take away the car I drive
I'mma still be Mary Blige

Repeat 1

[Prodigy]
Let's separate the bullshit from the truth
Straight up, I ain't got time for new friends, I need paper
We came up from the trenches
It was like pulling teeth without sedation
From the benches to the Bentley seats
Nigga, we the M-O-B-B
What, you ain't heard? You can't see?
Ever since the cash they wanna hound P
Oh now you got L-O-V-E for me

[Havoc]
Doing this for about a decade Mobb and Mary
Troopers in the game with a heavy load to carry
After all the trials and tribulations
Rumors we faced, the media invading our space
That's the price you gotta pay
Take away by signs of whips
I'mma just plain old me at the end of the day
You can say what you choose
God gonna see me through
Criticize all you want 'till your face turn blue
I know you see

[Mary]
If you take away the house
And you take away the clothes I wear
And you take away the diamonds
I'mma still be standing here
And if you take away the voice and the money
I will always be my nigga's favorite honey
And if you take away the car I drive
I'mma still be Mary Blige

Repeat 1 till end

[Verse 1]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

[Chorus]
Jam
It ain’t, It ain’t too much stuff
It ain’t too much
It ain’t too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain’t too much stuff
It ain’t, don't you
It ain’t too much for me to
Jam

[Verse 2]
The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

Jam, jam, here comes the man
Hot damn, the big boy stands with an upper hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal, that's the man cause Mike's so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle

Execute the plan, first I cooled it like a fan
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael
Cause it aren’t too hard to

Best thing to do is stay low (Yeah), LOX and J.Lo

[Diddy]

Time to take it back to the gutter
The queen of hip-hop soul

[Break: Mary J. Blige (Jay-Z)]
Oohh, live your life 'cause life is love
Always thank the man above (thank you, uh)
The more you give the more you get (that's real talk)
Yeah, yeah (let me warm it up for ya)

[Verse: Jay-Z]
Who better to usher you back through the gutter
Than America's number one hustler (it's Young, fucka!)
Don't call it a come back
Unless there's some money attached to that
And you can call it whatever you like, in fact
It's something like a phenomenon
Like I'm a young LeBron, gettin' my high school games on
TV just for dunkin' on
Whoever want it with Shawn
We can get it jumpin' like Donkey Kong
We could get it thumpin' like bum-ba-bum
Travel the way of the gun, come on, c-come on
No, I'm not only beggin' I'm eggin' you on
Until you dead or gone that's the vendetta I'm on
This ain't no video game with wrestlers on it
The competitor on this is on some shit
Honest, come through all black like a Amish (woo!)
Holsters under the armpit, the arm spit, ha
It's just that Brooklyn don shit
Along with the queen from Yonkers
Come on kiss the ring, 'fore I let miss Mary sing
Exposed to you her soul into everything, yeah
It's classic material
I see you bastards at the burial
Jay go first and then Mary go, round
I just ride, hold her down with the fifth by my side
Me and miss Blige
Look up in the sky, it's a bird of that 'caine
And the hydro flow that I brought to the game
I could go mo' but I'ma let ma do her thang
Brooklyn, we did it again

[Outro: Diddy]
I can't really explain what it is about her
I don't know it's just, it's something special
Ain't nobody like her, there's only one Mary
Only one queen of hip-hop soul
Love and life, let's do it
Telephone rings two times

[Intro: Lil' Kim & Jermaine Dupri]
Uh, you got it going on, what what
Uh, you got it going on, what what
C'mon, c'mon, haha

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Strictly fuck with those six-digit niggas
If the first one is a nine, they a buck behind
I live my rhyme at the same time, can't find myself laying up
If you ain't paying up, bullets start spraying up
You know my niggas is sick
The game ain't enough for you to run up in this
I need stacks of chips, you know, dream house money
Shit, you just like me, so don't start acting funny

[Verse 2: Usher]
You're the kind of girl that makes
Everybody feel that you're just so damn good
So damn good
But your secrets, I've found out
So don't deny what you're about
I know the truth
You know I do, I do 'cause....

[Chorus: Usher]
I know you get lonely (just like me)
And you want it (just like me)
But act like you don't
When you know you're just like me
I know you get lonely (just like me)
And you want it (just like me)
But act like you don't
When you know you're just like me

[Verse 3: Usher]
Quiet is kept you cry for help
When no one else is there I bet you touch yourself
Does it feel good?
Late night calls, I bet you do it all
Anything to get it off
But you still persist to front on me
Baby, tell me

[Bridge]
Why do we play this game of chase
When we know we both feel the same way?
And why do you put me through all these changes
When you know you're just a freak like me?
You're just like me

[Verse 4: Lil' Kim]
If I had one wish in the world, I swear to God
It would be for girls to rock pearls, straight out the oyster
Voice your opinion, Queen Bee made a million
Got mirrors on my ceiling, so I can see it
When your head be in between it, if I had a penis
I'd be heartless, for real, though, niggas start shit
I'd just flash out my dildo, y'all move too quick
Thought I'd be memorized by your cocaine bricks
And you smoke gray six, nigga, I thought you was a groupie
Obsessed fan with my pictures in your hooptie
You heard my record, now you know I'm freaky
So you, wanna wreck it and you, wanna see me
How your dreams be, you want me sexual
In a gun fight, two on three, I'm next to pull
And I love life, something you never could imagine
Then you woke the fuck up, it's just rapping

[Chorus: Usher]
I know you get lonely (just like me)
And you want it (just like me)
But act like you don't
When you know you're just like me
I know you get lonely (just like me)
And you want it (just like me)
But act like you don't
When you know you're just like me

[Outro: Usher]
Don't front like you don't, you're just like me
Just like me
Just like me
Just like me, yeah
Just like me

This, is, sim-ple

Another, man
Can't, quite
Love you girl, (yeah, a little louder) like I can
Your fantasies and your dreams
Believe in me, I will fulfill
Now you know, how I feel
Now baby, tell me, how do you feel

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
Boy I feel like this just can't be real
And if I'm dreamin please don't wake me up
So what's the deal, should I save my love for you?
Cos no one makes me feel the way that you do

[Pre-Hook: Mary J. Blige]
You make me wanna see your face everyday (mmm)
Deep down inside I know that you're my soul mate (you are my soul mate)
If you should leave, I'm waiting patiently (oh, don't leave)
Cos boy I know that you're the one for me (ooh)

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Let me be the one to give you everything (boy I wanna be the one)
Let me be the one that's always in your dreams (always be in your dreams)
Let me be the one who'd be right by your side (I'll be there, I'll be there)
Let me be the one (Let me be the one)
Let me be the one (Let me be the one)

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
I'm your girl, see there's no one quite like me
Nobody will love you the way that I do
I get chills when you put your arms around me
You make me feel like I'm the only one

[Pre-Hook: Mary J. Blige]
You make me wanna see your face everyday
Deep down inside I know that you're my soul mate (you are my soul mate)
If you should leave I'm waiting patiently (I'll be right here waiting)
Cos boy I know that you're the one for me (you're the one, you're the one)

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Let me be the one to give you everything (ohh, let me be)
Let me be the one that's always in your dreams (I wanna be the one in your dreams, babe)
Let me be the one who'd be right by your side (I'll be there, I'll be there)
Let me be the one, (baby, let me)
Let me be the one (heyyyy-oooohh)

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Baby if ever you need someone who knows you
Someone to go to, someone to be by your side
Baby if ever you need someone to talk to
Someone to hold you, someone to be down to ride
You can count on me, I'll be there for you
When you need me, I care for you like you care for me
Please believe me if I was locked up, I know you'd be the one to come see me
Because you understand life where we from ain't easy
Problems, they say when it rains it pours
But I'm sure together we could weather the storm
Your friends, they don't understand the shit we on
When I'm gone I'm missin you, your love is unconditional
You're my heart, I need you to live, picture me dissin you
Now picture something positive, me huggin and kissin you
If you ever doubt how I feel then this is what you should listen to
(Listen to, listen to)

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Let me be the one to give you everything
Let me be the one that's always in your dreams
Let me be the one who'd be right by your side
Let me be the one, let me be the one
Let me be the one to give you everything
(let me be the one, let me be the one, let me be the one for you)
Let me be the one that's always in your dreams
(let me be the one, let me be the one, let me be the one for you)
Let me be the one who'd be right by your side
(let me be the one, let me be the one, let me be the one for you)
Let me be the one, let me be the one
(let me be the one, let me be the one, let me be the one for you)

[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
Let me be the one, let me be the one, let me be the one for you
Let me be the one, let me be the one, let me be the one for you
Let me be the one, let me be the one, let me be the one for you
Let me be the one, let me be the one, let me be the one for you
Let me be the one, let me be the one, let me be the one for you
Let me be the one, let me be the one, let me be the one for you
Whoa, love is all we need
Cause everybody needs love

Love is all we need
To make everything complete
If we try to live together and be happy
You and me are one and we've only just begun
So let's make a new beginning have some fun

1-Love is all we need, to make everything complete
All we need is L-O-V-E, love is all we need
Cause to love you would mean everything
Everybody needs love

Dealing with tough times seems to always blow my mind
But I know where my heart is so I am fine, I'm fine
If we remain friends it would never ever end
On this love I give to you, you can depend
(repeat 1)

Love is all we need to make every little thing complete
Yeah, yeah, oh if you would trust in me
I would let you know that I love you, that I love you
Oh, Lord, don't ever leave me...
Love is all we need, yeah, yeah, yeah

In this land that's dark
If you my man and you my heart

Need bail? Put up the cash for you
Girls who mad loyal, die for you
Leave them if they acting too fly for you
All up in yo' mix then in somebody else six
Quick to put your name in some murder one shit
I'm not the one cheatin' on you, or beatin' on you
Cause I'm laid back you thought that I was sleeping on you?
Real love make a ill thug feel bug
Nas analyze, are you trustworthy by the looks in your eyes?
Stay with me, be my dog like Dollar and Richie
She convinced me
All we really need is love, strictly

Love is all we need to make everything complete
I want to be happy yeah, want to be happy
Love is all we need, and I know that it can be done

Much LOOOOVE to the people, eh-haha ha...
Hahaha...BROOKLYYYYYYYN...

[crowd cheers wildly as song fades]

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

[Intro: Ghostface Killah *during Chorus*]
Ghostface, dollar, dollars

[Jennifer Lopez]
When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast so I would notice you
But you're hard to miss, think you ought to know
Doesn't really matter if you're balling out of control

[Chorus 2: Jennifer Lopez]
All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy yeah

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Eh-yo ma' you always kept it real
You been had a Benz way before I got this deal
I know its not about the money, the ropes or the missed stones
The leather, platinum rings and summer b-tones
They say we fled from the cameras, boo
Plus they found a hammer and ordered to trap me off
They must question you, say Jenny, shh, look me dead in my eyes
You tellin me that I don't love you boo, that wouldn't be wise
We whine in the best cuisines, Italian restaurants
Big lobster dishes wit Trump, this how come I feel for you
Sweetheart I'll kill for you
Shockin secrets revealed and my will goes to you
So stop all the yellin, Jennifer calm down
We need classed, guidance counsellors to calm us down
A grown man and stand as a man of my word
You see here? Look at her, all these bitches is birds

[Chorus 2 - 2X]

[Break: Ghostface Killah]
Eh-yo ma', you know you the realest
It's real right now, ya heard?
It's like they ain't got nothin to kill right now
It's like e'rything gon' be a'ight
You watch and see

[Jennifer Lopez (Ghostface Killah)]
You think the money that you make
Can substitute the time you take
To get the keys into my heart
Think you can win my heart
Don't know what's in my heart (I got it ma')
I think you need to take some time (Indeed)
To show me that your love is true (It is)
There's more than dollar signs in you
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart
(I got it ma', I got it ma')

[Chorus - 2X]

[Intro: Smif-n-Wessun]
This is how we do...every day all day
This is how we do, this is how we do
Smif-n-Wessun don't play
This is how we do...every day all day
This is how we do, this is how we do
Click click click, in the night

[Break: Smif-n-Wessun] (x5)
I shine, you shine, shine

[Verse 1: Smif-n-Wessun]

[In this day and time
We maintain the same frame of mind
Elevation, spark it up
Yo, start the circulation, 360 degrees in rotation
Stimulation, as the herb bless my physical creation
Slip into a hallucination
Situations, got me thinking about my life seriously
Keep it real continuously
Before I slip into blackness I prepare for combat
Protect my dome 'cause that's where my home's at
Crack my windows, inhale as the mist blows
Build up my mental, construct on my physical
Spreading love to my Brooklyn crew (Who be you?)]
Bad boys, Smif-n-Wessun, comin' through
Tek and Steele, travelin' through the battle and
Handlin' all that is challengin' to the very end

[Hook: Smif-n-Wessun]
This is how we do
This is how we do, everyday all day
This is how we do, this is how we do
Smif-n-Wessun we don't play
This is how we do, this is how we do
When we get down with Mary J
This is how we do, this is how we do
Click click click...

[Hook: Mary J. Blige] (x2)
All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record
I love you, I love you

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
When I found out you were leaving me
I couldn't sleep thinkin' about
All the things that we've been through
Now all I want to do is tell you that I miss you
So much (you know I really really miss you)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] (x2)
All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record
I love you, I love you

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige]
Now that I'm on my own
I know, that in time I'll find somebody
That'll treat me better than you
So I go on my own, without you
But I still love you (you know I'll never live without you)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] (x2)
All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record
I love you, I love you

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
I wish you change your way soon enough
So we can be together
You just don't understand your love
But now all we have is memories

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] (x2)
All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record
I love you, I love you

[Verse 4: Smif-n-Wessun]
Hip-hop, sets out in the park
Blaze an L, raisin' hell 'til the day got dark
Got me reminiscing back like Mary J
When I sit back and peep the games people play
Too high to get over 'cause I'm rolling through life like a soldier
Holding the weight of my fate on my shoulder
Blazing the trees with my Duck Down family
P-N-C, One L-O-V-E

[Outro: Smif-n-Wessun]
You know how we do
This is how we do every day all day
This is how we do when we get down with Mary J
This is how we do, this is how we do
Smif-n-Wessun we don't play
This is how we do, when we break day
Click click click...

[Intro: Usher & Beyoncé]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Soundz, I hear you, man
Usher
Yeah, this it right here
Queen B, yeah
I'm the king, y'all know that
She the queen, came right back
Listen to me
Yeah, yeah
Oh, remix

[Verse 1: Usher & Beyoncé]
Now, baby girl, there ain't nothing more that I can say
You know by now, I want it more than anything
If I walk away and just let you leave
You'll be stuck in my head like a melody
I know you want it (Yeah)
But I'm hesitating (Why?)
You must be crazy, I got a man, you got a lady
I know, we here together, so this must be something special
'Cause you could be anywhere you wanted

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
But you decided to be here with me
No coincidence, it was meant to be
Don't be shy, come let your boy get in
So you can tell all of your friends
You was on the remix, like...

[Chorus: Usher]
In this club, in this club
Ladies, can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watching, I ain't stopping
Baby, I don't give up
In this club, in this club
Ladies, can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watching
Baby, I don't give up in this club

[Verse 2: Beyoncé, Usher & Both]
Baby, you know I'd be down
But we can't have all these people staring, standing around
This right here is only for your eyes to see
But you getting carried away, saying we can do it wherever
The way you touching me like no other
I'ma make you feel insane
Trying your hardest to make me give in
But I'ma be down to give you whatchu wanting if you keep it up
I strongly doubt this velvet rope would hold me up
And I don't want security rolling up on us (I got you)
I'm not hesitating, I just don't wanna rush
You could be anywhere you wanted

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
But you decided to be here with me
No coincidence, it was meant to be
I guess if I mess around and let you get in
You gon' tell all of your friends
You was on this remix, like...

[Chorus: Beyoncé, Usher & Both]
In this club, in this club
Fellas, can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watching, I'm stopping
Baby, I don't give up
In this club, in this club
Ladies, can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watching
Baby, I don't give up in this club

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Ahem, shawty want a thug
It started with a hug
And the rest went like this
I gave her neck, a kissy-kiss
She gave my neck a kiss back
I said, we could do it like a stack
I mean, we could do it like a G
On the couch in V.I.P
Shawty, we could get it on
I'm like, shout out to the DJ for playing this song
Girl, we could act like two damn fools
And everybody think we doing a dance move
Call me, so I can make it juicy for ya
Meet me in the bathroom and you could be my secret lover, girl
Haha, and it started with a hug
But now we making love in this club
And we're not gonna stop just because
The people in the crowd are watching us
But we don't give a damn what they say
And this is the, the remix, baby

[Bridge: Usher & Beyoncé]
Come a little closer to daddy, put it on you
Need you to know what happens here, stays here
And I'm ready and willing, almost got to go
Got you standing at attention, keep it on the low
Ain't nobody watching, don't worry, they can't see us
I know I got you hot, now let me in
You in the club or the car, wherever you are
Run and tell the DJ, run it back on replay

[Chorus: Usher, Beyoncé & Both]
In this club, in this club
Fellas (Ladies), can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watching, I ain't stopping
Baby, I don't give up
Now, run and tell all of your friends
You gotta hear this remix, like...

[Outro: Usher, Beyoncé & Lil Wayne]
King and queen, y'all know
Yeah, man
If we make love in this club
What would music be without Soundz?
In this club, in this club
Nobody will know, baby...

[Intro: Usher]
Gotta do it for the ladies
And I gotta keep it hood
Where we at, Polow? (Hey)
I see you, Ryan
Yo, Keith, you was right
But we just getting started
Yeah, man

[Verse 1: Usher]
You say you're searching for somebody that'll take you out and do you right
Well, come here, baby and let daddy show you what it feel like
You know all you got to do is tell me what you sipping on
And I promise that I'm gonna keep it coming all night long

[Pre-Chorus 1: Usher]
Looking in your eyes while you on the other side
And I think that shawty, I got a thing for you
Doing it on purpose, winding and working it
I can tell by the way you looking at me, girl

[Chorus: Usher]
I wanna make love in this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
I wanna make love in this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)

[Verse 2: Usher]
You got some friends rolling with you, baby, then that's cool
You can leave them with my homies, let them know that I got you
If you didn't know, you're the only thing that's on my mind
'Cause the way I'm staring at you got me wanna give it to you all night

[Pre-Chorus 2: Usher]
Looking in your eyes while you on the other side
I can't take it no more, baby, I'm coming for you
You keep doing it on purpose, winding and working
If we close our eyes, it could just be me and you

[Chorus: Usher]
I wanna make love in this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
I wanna make love in this club (Hey)

I wanna make love in this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
I'm what you want, I'm what you need
He got you trapped, I'll set you free
Sexually, mentally, physically, emotionally
I'll be like your medicine, you'll take every dose of me
It's going down on aisle three, I'll bag you like some groceries
And every time you think about it, you gon' want some more of me
'Bout to hit the club, make a movie, yeah, rated R
Pulled up like a trap star, that's if you had your regular car
You ever made love to a thug in the club with his ice on?
87 Jeans and a fresh pair of Nikes on
On the couch, on the table, on the bar, or on the floor
You can meet me in the bathroom
Yeah, you know I'm trained to go

[Bridge: Usher]
Might as well give me a kiss
If we keep touching like this
I know you're scared, baby, they don't know what we doing
Let's both get undressed right here
Keep it up, girl, and I swear
I'ma give it to you non-stop
And I don't care who's watching
Watching, watching
In this club, on the floor
Baby, let's make love

[Chorus: Usher]
I wanna make love in this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
I wanna make love in this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Just somethin' 'bout you...
Way I'm lookin' at you, whatever
You keep lookin' at me
You gettin' scared now, right?
Don't feel me, baby, it's just Justin
It feel good, right?
Listen

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
I kinda noticed, something wasn't right
From your colorful face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me, your face will change

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Just remember
Sing a song with me

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (Hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
See, people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
If you smile, then that should set the tone
Just be limber, baby
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Baby, just remember
Sing a song with me

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (Hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

[Verse 3: Justin Timberlake]
Yeah, you know I can make ya happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance to be your man
(I won't let you down, baby)
If you give me that chance to be your man
(Here baby, put on my jacket)
And then..

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you, baby)
Girl (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you, baby)
Girl (Ooh)

[Verse 4: Pusha T, Malice, (Justin Timberlake)]
Ma, whatchu wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend see, I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
In the mall kids ask "How the chain glow?"
Point to her they say, "Wow, it's the same glow"
Point to me I say, "Yeah, it's the same dough"
We the same type, you my a-like (Yeah)
You have me sleepin' in the same bed every night
Go ride wit me you deservin' the best
Take a few shots, let it burn in your chest
We could ride down, pumpin' N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play number three, joint called "Brain" (I just love your... brain)
Ma, took a hint, make me swerve in the lane
The name Malicious and I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake - now how heavy is that?

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you, baby)
Girl (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you, baby)
Girl
Oh

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Ain't nobody love you like I love you (Can't love you like I do)
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya like I do (Hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you (Hey)
You will know the difference when I...

[Outro: Justin Timberlake]
Break it down
You know, I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
I never thought it would end up this way, drums (Hey!)
It's kind of special right? Yeah
You know, you think about it
Sometimes people, just destined
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is
Now everybody dance...

[Verse 1: Foxy Brown]
Trackmasters, Commisioner
You say you keep me laced in everything, baguettes his and her
Matchin' E-class, twin chincilla furs
Everything was real 'til he slipped and swerved
Swore the love was real then he bounced with hers
Kept me off speed, blessed me backwards, made my heart bleed
Killed me softly; he don't know how much it cost me
If the love is all we need, real queens will survive
Now peep the remix with Fox and J. Blige
Come on

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
I've got to let you know
That this is the only way (let 'em know)
Troubles far and near, but have no fear
'Cause love is always on the way
Oh, love

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete (So complete, love)
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige]
If you don't know, then I'm telling you
It works with everything you do
Problems every day, but we'll find a way
'Cause love is going to save the day (Come on)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete
(To make every little thing complete)
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete
(Love is all, love is all, all we need)
Love is all we need (All we need)
To make every little thing complete
(Love is all we need)

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Do you know what we really need?
Do you know that love is going to set us free? (Set us free)
Yeah, just you and me
Do you think we can live this way?
'Cause I know that love is going to save the day (Save the day)
In every way

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete (Every little thing complete)
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete
(It's gonna make, gonna make everything complete)

[Bridge 2: Mary J. Blige]
Love is all we need to make things better
(Love is all we need, love is all we need)
It's the only way to live together
(It's the only way we can live)
Love is all we need to make things better
(Love is all we need to make everything complete)
It's the only way to live together
(It's the only way, the only way to live together)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete (Make everything complete)
Love is all we need (All we need is love)
To make every little thing complete
Love is all we need

[Mary J. Blige]
I can't believe it
Could this be love, ya'll?
Could it be love, could it be love
At first sight?

[Intro: Diddy]
Come on, let's go, I see you Mary
I like this right here, you ready?
The queen of hip hop soul
Bad boy, Mary J. Blige, yeah, back together again, let's go

[Mary J. Blige]
Lookin' at you from a distance
Gettin' all of my attention
Could this be love at first sight, baby
You walked away and I missed you
Visions of wanting to kiss you
How could this be if I don't really know you?
Ohh baby, baby

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Could it be love at first sight?
And I never knew that I, could fall in love on the very first night
Could this be love?

[Mary J. Blige]
You had on the latest fashion
It was a bigger distraction
It drew me closer and closer to you, yeah, baby
I never saw anything like this
But you I just could not resist
I swallowed my pride and stepped through your side
Or could it be - be

[Hook]

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
I wanna know if you could call me up (could you call me up sometime? please)
And maybe somebody we just might hook up, could this love at first sight?

[Method Man]
Once again, it's that other M&M now
How many women feelin' him?
Somebody call the coroner, quick, Mary is killin 'em
Tell 'em what's the 411 and who came runnin'
When Clef dialed 911 from shots comin'
This somethin' for the radio, guest starring M.C
Johnny Blazin' the hip hop and R&B
What, ya'll thought ya wasn't gon' see me
You can't spell Mary J. Blige without a J.B
Well back to the matter, and it's sex on the platter
She only wanna be happy and I ain't mad at her
You go momma, nowadays, I'm more calmer
And if you take a look at my life, no more drama
Now you know, you searchin' for a Wu-Tang pro
You find me, just bout everywhere the poontang go
Now you know, feel me like your favorite love song
Cuz my computer love is the thetruth.com

[Hook 2X]
Intro: I'm so high

[Puffy] Rock on!

[Verse One: LL Cool J]
Black shades, three-quarter leathers and medallions
Honies lined up ready to ride like stallions
Since good love is hard to find
I snatch up the real hot ones and make 'em mine
I let my track record speak instead of me
On a level that the halfway players will never see
Uhh, wave your drinks in the air
Shorty turn around keep the ass right there
Focus your attention-let your eyes
Get paralyzed, by the size
Of my rocks, just remember that members of my click carry Glocks
We got it locked down
Mo' flowin', click rollin'
Niggas still smokin' 

[L get 'em open]
Team rough scoop the cream with the puff
You oughtta stop sleepin', you don't dream enough

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Oooooh baby, not tonight, I don't wanna fuss and fight
I just wanna make it right
Oooooooh, there's work to do
I wanna get real close to you, I wanna get you in the mood
All the things, you want to do
Just relax, and I'll take care of you
And anytime you want me
I'm sayin' that I love you everyday
And I know that you want me, baby admit it

[Chorus:]
Gimme all your love and don't stop
My love's waiting when you reach the top
All night long
Come into my bedroom honey
What I got will make you spend money
All night long

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
You know, that I know that you love me
So if you just give me a change
I can still show you romance
I know, that you still savor for my flavor baby
So stop playin' hard to get
Let's make love like we first met
All the things, you want to do
Just relax, and I'll take care of you
And anytime you want me
I'm sayin' that I love you everyday
And you know that you want me baby admit it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
Girlfriend you get me open like Moet, cherry goes pop
When my love drops
Two G's in my pockets for tricks
So tell your girlfriends to warm up and mingle with my click
You're only a customer
You're walking in the presence of hustlers
I did it just right
Spent money all night
Magnums of Moet
Get your lips wet

[Chorus x2]

[Intro: Ghostface Killah (& Beyonce)]
Yeah, y'all ready for this one?
Uh-huh, yeah
'Cause I just want you to dance
Beyonce, Tony Starks
Yeah, the remix
Music World, yeah
Beat beats, c'mon
(All the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it out)
Yo, baby, what's all this you telling everybody
We broke up and all this, you know what I'm saying?
I'm hearin' off the streets and all that, ma
Talk to me or something, huh
I don't know what's goin' on, baby
You know, I got my clothes up in the joint
And you up here just packin' my gear
What happened, boo?

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So young and naive to believe that with me, you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete, when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I moved on, 'cause I realized I got

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Me, myself and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm'on gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm'on gonna be my own best friend

[Beyonce]
(You're so) controlling, you say that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day, I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
Now that it's over, stop calling me, come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me, all your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I got

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Me, myself and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm'on gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm'on gonna be my own best friend

[Bridge: Beyonce]
(I've got me, myself and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out
(I can't regret all the time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(It's how I learned how to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again
(I've got me, myself and I)
Yeah, I know that I will never disappoint myself
(I must have cried a thousand times)
I've cried, all the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out
(I can't regret all the time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(It's how I learned how to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Changes, we all go through changes
Arguments, disagreements, and to some it's dangerous
But your mind and your heart's clogged with all your pain and
But a bond that we was holding's what made us famous
Hey miss, beautiful mami with tears of stone
Stop cryin', come talk to Tone
Tell me everything that's goin' wrong like your needs and doubts
My reason for coming in late, I need cheese and sprouts
So I could continue to hold down the foundation
It's pitiful how you could charge me with violations
Patience is the key, fuck the frustrations
We act off our emotions and we start hatin'
And that leads to stress, problems and weight loss
Total baldness, broke homes come from negative forces
Baby be cautious, you got to call the cops to get me out
When it come, babe, I'm goin' all out
It's T-O-N-E-Y, to Beyonce, my, sweetie pie
Please try, be mine til we die

[Bridge: Beyonce]
Now I've got me, myself and I
(Me, myself and I)
I must have cried a thousand times
(I have cried so many times)
I can't regret time spent with you
(I can't regret time spent with you)
It's how I learned how to make it through
(After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again)
Now I've got me, myself and I
(I know that I will never disappoint myself)
I must have cried a thousand times
(If you've cried a thousand times, ladies you will survive)
I can't regret time spent with you
(Yeah, you hurt me but I learned a lot along the way)
It's how I learned how to make it through
(I can see the sun shine, I've got me, myself and I)

[Intro]
Money
Money
Lie for it
Spy for it
Kill for it
Die for it

[Verse 1]
So you call it trust but I say it's just
In the devil's game of greed and lust
They don't care, they'd do me for the money
They don't care, they use me for the money
So you go to church and read the holy word
In the scheme of life, it's all absurd
They don't care
They'd kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag, your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge
You're called the "Just Few"
And you're fighting the wars, a soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but

[Pre-Chorus]
If you show me the cash, then I will take it
If you tell me to cry, then I will fake it
If you give me a hand, then I will shake it
You would do anything for money

[Chorus]
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you
Would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil

[Verse 2]
Insurance?
Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi? I don't think so
You don't care, you'd do her for the money
Say it's fair, you sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold, need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul 'cause your God is such
You don't care, you kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttony and greed?
Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers
'Cause they're the backstabbers

[Pre-Chorus]
If you know it's a lie, then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt, then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance, then you will dare it
You would do anything for money

[Chorus]
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil

[Bridge]
You say you wouldn't do it for all the money in the world
I don't think so
If you show me the man, then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie, then I will tell him
If you're dealing with God, then you will hell him
You would do anything for money

[Chorus]
Anything (Ah)
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil

[Verse 1]
You can look at them comin' out the walls
You can look at them climbin' out the bushes
You can find them when the letter's 'bout to fall
He be waitin' with his camera right on focus

[Pre-Chorus]
Everywhere you seem to turn there's a monster
When you look up in the air there's a monster
Paparazzi got you scared like a monster, monster, monster

[Chorus]
(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood it's got you jumpin' like you should
(Too bad)
It's got you bouncin' off the wall
It's got you drunk enough to fall
(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood, just look in the mirror
And tell me you like, don't you, don't you like it?
Monster, he's a monster, he's an animal
Monster, yeah, he's a monster, he's an animal, ho-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
He's coming at ya
Coming at ya rather too fast
Mama say mama got you in a zig zag
And you're runnin'
And you're runnin' just to 'scape it
But they're gunnin' for the money
So they fake it

[Pre-Chorus]
Everywhere you seem to turn there's a monster
When you look up in the air, there's a monster
When you see them in the street
That's a monster, monster, monster

[Chorus]
(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood it's got you jumping like it should
It's got you bouncing off the wall
It's got you drunk enough to fall
(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood, just look in the mirror
And tell me you like what ya see
Monster, he's like an animal, (he's a monster) just like an animal (he's an animal)
And he's moving in the air
Monster, he's a monster, he's an animal
Everybody wanna be a video star

[Bridge]
Why are they never satisfied with'n all you give?
You give them your all, they're watching you fall
And they eat your soul (like a vegetable)

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Catch me in a bad mood, flipping, you'll take a whippin'
Animal, Hannibal, cannibal addiction
Tears appear, yeah, blurring your vision
Fear in the air, screaming, your blood drippin'
Shiver a second, now, now, now, what is it?
Funerals, cemeteries, don't worry, it's time to visit
Broke bones, tombstones, how do you think I'm kiddin'?
It's home, sweet home, the land of the forbidden
All hail, run tell, the King has risen
2010 Thriller, there's nothin iller, it's killer
Their vision, they miss 'em, won't impact, this is that
It's the bomb, ring the alarm, MJ number one
It goes on and on, it goes on and on
We get to creeping and crawling in the early morn'
Dream on dreamer, there's nowhere to run
You can try but you're done
I can feel it in the air, here the monster come

[Chorus]
(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood has got you jumpin' like you should
It's got you bouncin' off the wall
It's got you drunk enough to fall
(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood just making me clearer
And tell me ya like, don't you, don't you?

[Post-Chorus]
Monster, say you wanna be a star
He's a monster, say you wanna go far
He's an animal, why do you keep stalking me?
Monster (what ya do to me?)
He's a monster, why'd you take it? Why'd you fake it?
He's an animal, yeah, why d'you torture me?
Monster, why you stalkin' me?
He's a monster, why d'you torture me?
He's an animal
Why did you do it? Why did you? Why you stalkin' me?
Monster, why d'you torture me?
He's a monster, why d'you torture me?
He's an animal, why d'you? Why d'you? ho-oh-oh!

[Outro]
He's draggin you down like a monster
He's keepin you down like a monster
He's draggin you down like a monster
He's keepin you down like a monster

Money make the world go round
Money make the world go round

Money makes the world go round
TM

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yo, for those who live the way that I live, we came a long way
From wiping cold outta eyelids, to rap's hottest
Fake Gazelles to black Pradas
Selling nicks to trey bags, to making hits like Kidada Jones' father
OG's would send me to the store with a dollar
Hit me with some wise advice for me to follow
Ain't nothing free in the world in life
No matter who you are, everybody got they price
And some cost more than other's
When you poor, it's like life ain't even worth living
But when you rich, it's every fat ass worth hittin'
With no chips, your drawers just stay on your hips
I play with the six 'cause money make the whole world spin
But without the Franklin faces, you see who's your real friends
It's V-12's, honeys on the cell, bobbin' out the JBL
It's Nas and R. Kell

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Never thought that I'd ever live this life
Money stacked in rolls, honeys on each side
Anything I want, I can say it's mine
No more worries 'bout how can I provide

[Chorus: Kelly Price, (Nas) & R. Kelly]
Money makes the world go round
(Nuttin' move but the money)
You believe it if you want to
Money makes the world go round
(Said nuttin' move but the money)

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Oh, many say it's wrong cuz I love to spend
Ice in everything countin' Benjamins
All I wanna do try, and let you know
If you don't believe, ask someone who's broke

[Chorus: Kelly Price, (Nas) & R. Kelly]
Money makes the world go round
(Money makes the world go round)
You believe it if you want to
Money makes the world go round
Yes, it does
(Said nuttin' move but the money)
Said money makes the world go round
(Money make the world go round, what?
Still nuttin' move but the money)
Nothing but the money
Money makes the world go round
Yes, it does

[Bridge: R. Kelly & Kelly Price]
Feels so good, yeah, yeah
So good, this life I finally live
And feels so real
So real this freedom I finally feel
Show me the money

[Chorus: Kelly Price, (Nas) & R. Kelly]
Money makes the world go round
(Go money, go money)
You believe it if you want to
Money makes the world go round
(Go money, go money, yo)
Said that almighty dollar
Money makes the world go round
Yes, it does
(Still don't nuttin' move but the money)
Money makes the world go round
From sun up till the sun goes down
(Yeah, what?)
So much money
Money makes the world go round
Hey, makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round
Show me a man that don't need money
Money makes the world go round
And I'll show you a world
(Show me a world)
Standing still
Money makes the world go round
Yes, it does, talking 'bout the loot
Money makes the world go round

Whoa, whoa, whoa   (repeat 2 times)

Chorus:
Can't get you off my mind
Thinking about you all the time   (repeat 2 times)

1st verse:
The day we met was the last day
That I said I would look anyone else's way
Now you know that I'm with you
And I'll always be true
There's nothing in this world that I won't do for you

Chorus

2nd verse:
The day you left
It was so sad
Now I'm standing here holding on to the past
Keep growing on
Gotta live your life
If we grow up in time
Maybe real love we will find

[Styles P]
You need rocks on the fourth finger of your left hand
Tell your bridemaids to hit off my best man
Always on my mind like money
You my honey
There when I'm laced
There when I'm bummy

[Sheek]
Say word
It's type hard for me to get you off...my mind
But I still get dough, of course
True love between a thug and a dove
Poppin' champagne in the tub
What

[Jadakiss]
Ayo
Everything revolves around trust
Cause if it wasn't for you
Then there wouldn't be no us
No jealousy, envy, and no lust
328 off the lot when I bust
Sittin' in the house counting Lincolns
And I'm still thinkin'
Can't get you off, so I'm blinkin'
Sinkin' down in the silk couch, milked out
Your hole in my heart got my love all spilt out

[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo
See, it's rare that you find people like us
Cause all y'all other... (look)
Out there doing what I'm doing
Or try to do what I'm doing
But you can't 'cause I do what I do, my way
What about you?
Huh? Huh?! Come on!

[Verse 1: Usher]
I do
Any and everything you want to
Make your girl say, "Oooh, oooh
Why is he so fly-I-I?"
She beeps me
Ever since she wanna get freaky
You can get mad if you want to, do whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it...

[Chorus: Usher]
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control

[Verse 2: Jermaine Dupri]
Bad ass, señoritas, two-seaters with kicks
New kicks, all in the mix
I don't turn no tricks, they turn for me
Catching bricks don't concern me
So forget it, little midget
My mind on seven digits
Before I pay Heaven skies a visit, now dig it
I'm pulling all stops, locking down all spots
Saying "You, can't, front"
So, from this day forth, you know I'm all about heat
And what I do be the Major League
That's why your girlfriend's paging me
And she know like he know
You don't see her like I see her, so she's out the door
Shotgun in my drop, having fun
With the Don, system bassing, conversation
About how she been chasing me
And facing me, saying, "Give it to me now, baby"

[Chorus: Usher]
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control

[Verse 3: Usher]
Don't check me
It was your girl who let me
Take it this far, then, ooh wee!
Let her have it every chance that she could get
What, you think you a baller?
And I ain't gon' call her, clip that
You can get mad if you want to, say whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it...

[Chorus: Usher]
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
This is ladies night, once again it's on!
Ya man actin' up? Then leave him home!
It's the girl the industry call the rap Madonna
More dangerous than a tank full of piranhas
Courvoisier in my left arm, glass in my other hand
While I rock that coochie like a rubber band
I'm feelin' sexy in my million dollar Vicki bra
Ay yo Beyonce, how you feelin' ma?

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I'm feelin' sexy, I wanna hear you say my name boy
If you can reach me, you can feel my buring flame
(I'm feelin' kinda N-A-S-T-Y, I just wanna take you home with me)
Baby, the minute I feel your energy, the vibe is just taking over me (Ahhhhhhhhh) I start feelin' so crazy, babe

The rhythm got me feelin' so crazy, babe

[Chorus: Beyoncé]

Baby, the minute I feel your energy, the vibe is just taking over me (Ahhhhhhhhh) I start feelin' so crazy, babe

Yeah, I'm lookin' like something to eat
Your man there lookin' like something to freak
Lickin' on his lips like I'm somethin' sweet
Lil' Kim and Beyonce just tryin to keep the flame lit
And warm it up like Big Daddy Kane did

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl (Uhhhhhhhh)

[Verse 1: John Legend]
You can't say I don't love you
Just because I cheat on you
Cause you can't see all I do
To keep you from knowing the things I do
Like erase my phone
And keep it out of town
I keep it strapped up when I sleep around
Well I should have known one day you'd find out
But you can't go and leave me now

[Hook: John Legend]
You know that I love you (know that I love you)
There's no one above you (no one above you)
I said it the last time (hey, hey)
But this is the last time
Don't make me over (don't leave me baby)
'Cause I can be faithful (you know I try)
Baby you're my number one (baby)
You're my number one

[Verse 2: John Legend]
Now who is she?
What's her name?
You don't need to know about everything
We fight about this
We fight about that
You hang up the phone and call me right back
Well I'll never be something I'm not
Please don't throw away what we've got
'Cause we've been together for way too long
I was playing around but I'm coming home

[Hook: John Legend]
You know that I love you (know that I love you)
There's no one above you (no one above you)
I said it the last time (hey, hey)
But this is the last time
Don't make me over (don't leave me baby)
'Cause I can be faithful (you know I try)
Baby you're my number one (baby)
You're my number one

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I keep you laced up so you ain't gotta borrow nothing
From them broke ass friends who be bargain hunting
They say they shop on eBay – baby why is they frontin'?
They be on the internet but they never cop nothin'
I keep you in Girl what is those on your toes?
And your neck staying froze off that rose colored gold
I suppose you was told by them hoes I was cheatin'
Thinkin' my heart don't got nothing to do with my penis
He got a mind of his own and he just be seeing shit
And I don't wanna cheat but I don't be saying shit
I try to jack off he ask me who is you playin' wit'?
But I know he love you he told me you was his favorite

[Hook: John Legend]
You know that I love you (know that I love you)

Don't make me over (don't leave me baby)
'Cause I can be faithful (you know I try)
Baby you're my number one (baby)
You're my number one

[Outro: John Legend]
You're making it hard for me
You're messing up everything
You tell me I gotta leave

Baby let's shine where we can shine
And ball where we can ball
Sharin' sometime together we not promised tomorrow
Know the difference between love and lust
Lustin' for your love f'na to feel your touch
Baby I'm grown, I'm not goin' through a phase
Let's talk, the touch could be brains in both ways
Now could you tell me, what's a king without a queen
I'm usin' metaphors, what's me without you is what I mean

[Mary J. Blige]
In the middle of the night, you hold me tight
Said it's alright, I'm yours forever
I'll do what you want, if you don't hurt me
I'll cook and clean, I'll make you happy
And

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Ooh! (What you do to me)
Ooh! (You're my everything)
And Ooh! (I'm so glad I found you)
Ooh! (I can't be without you)

[Mary J. Blige]
Got a chill in my bones, and it's all for you babe
Can't leave you alone, I'm so addicted
I can't sanctify, its the sweetest pain
So who's your girl?
You better say my name

[Llyod Banksl
It feels like I made it to heaven when I'm inside her
And we ain't gotta keep no secrets cuz she's a rider
She got a hold of her kid that's tighter than yo' pliers
And I got her hittin' notes that's higher than Mariah's
Maybe I'm jumpin' or gunnin', maybe I'm crazy
Maybe she's movin' too fast, maybe I'm lazy
She's kind'a different you know
Her body shape'll make you wanna take a trip in the snow

[Young Buck]
My thug luv got her, the way I put it down
Got you callin' on my phone when ya man not around
Shorty I know what you like and we don't have fight
You ain't gotta be trippin', you know I'm comin' home tonight
Tried to warn ya bout a playa, but she ain't wanna listen
Till I got ya in the bedroom, huggin' and kissin'
I got what ya missin', put you in the position
Now you hollerin' and screamin', talkin' bout how I did ya
Come on baby

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Ooh! (What you do to me)
Ooh! (You're my everything)
And Ooh! (I'm so glad I found you)
Ooh! (I can't be without you)

[Mary J. Blige]
What you do to me (What you do to me)
Is just a mystery (Heyy Heyyy)
Its hard to believe, that you are here with me
Makin' all my dreams (Makin' all my dreams)
Have seen reality (Seen reality)
All my life I've tried
To find what's best for me

[Chorus 2x]
Ooh! (What you do to me)
Ooh! (You're my everything)
And Ooh! (I'm so glad I found you)
Ooh! (I can't be without you)

[Intro]

[R. Kelly]
I hope y'all got y'all playa's cards
'Cause y'all ain't gettin' in unless you do

[The Game]
Bounce, it's the new 12-play
Bounce, throw the pussy like Elway
Bounce, I wanna see your tail shake
Bounce, when you hear R. Kellz say

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough
Honeys got ass bouncin' on the floor
This is how we do behind the playa's door

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
(She on the floor) Surrounded by them playas and thugs
(She on the floor) The girls goin' wild in the club
(In V.I.P.) Got 'dro with a bottle of bub
(She don't care) Shakin' ass, just throwin' 'em up
I'd really like to know her
The way she runs her
Body up and down, she got me heated up
I can't front, I really wanna beat it up
Show her how I hit the bar and spend it up
You ain't gotta be worried 'bout being alone
'Cause tonight we'll be together in my home
Exit out the club, bouncin' our domes
Got that red coupe matchin' the chrome
Put that body in motion, motion
And watch it wave like a ocean, ocean
Now break it down and worm it, worm it
Now bring it up, now shake it, shake it

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough
Honeys got ass bouncin' on the floor
This is how we do behind the playa's door

[Verse 2: The Game]
I'm still fresh like, uhh, Impala, uhh
Dre's young gun still ridin' the bass drum
Four times platinum, Hate It Or Love It, I'm still number one
Still in the hood, one hand on my gun
And my trigger finger still make bitches come
I mean the one with the ring in the tongue
Compton, R. Kelly found her in the slumps
Shaking that rump, both hands on the pumps
Send her home with me, I have your girl yellin', uhh
Kellz, my bitch drunk
But her two girlfriends still wanna have fun
Pass the blunt, let her drink red rum
Bet she ain't never seen a penthouse at the Trump
Me and R. been around the world
And we'll give it to you just how you like it, girl

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Girl, you're on a mission
Step into the club, shuttin' down competition
The way you walk it, talk it, switch it
And when the doors close, handle your business
Now make your booty go (Boom boom boom boom)
Break it down now (Boom boom boom boom boom)
Bring it up now (Boom boom boom boom)
Push it back, girl
(Kellz, you crazy for this one)
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Out the club, in the coupe to the mansion
We gon' get bent up 'til the morning
Laying back in the chair while you wind it
Lap dance on me girl, bump and grind it
We gon' do it 'til we drop, until the party stop
We gon' keep it hot, oh

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough
Honeys got ass bouncin' on the floor
This is how we do behind the playa's door

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
I like it when you flip that, bump that, roll that
Shake that, drop that, grope that
Make it go clap-clap
Flip that, bump that, roll that, shake that
Drop that, grope that
Make it go clap-clap

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough
Honeys got ass bouncin' on the floor
This is how we do behind the playa's door

[Outro: R. Kelly]

And this that uptown classic

Give it to 'em
Take 'em uptown to the Polo Ground
Take 'em uptown to the Polo Ground
Take 'em uptown to the Polo Ground
Take 'em uptown to the Polo Ground

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize
I really want to put you on
I've been searching for someone
To satisfy my every need
Won't you be my inspiration
Be the real love that I need

[Chorus]
Real love
I'm searching for the real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love
I'm searching for a real love

[Verse 2]
Oh when I met you I just knew
That you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you felt for me
You said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see
All of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration
Lead me towards a real love

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I've got to have a real love
Love so true and oh, baby
I thought that love was you
I thought you were the answer
To the question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong
If I stay strong maybe I'll find a

[Rap: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Look up in the sky
It's a bird, it's a plane
Nope, it's Mary Jane, ain't a damn thing changed
Kickin' ill flava with the Teflon Don
Wreckin' shop, gettin' props
She got it goin' on
So what's it gonna be?
The real one, the fake one
Ya need a minute to think for whom ya better take
What up? My time is up
Peace out to brooklyn
Helpin' Daddy-O, hey yo, bring the verse in

[Verse 4: Mary J. Blige]
So I try my best and pray to God
He'd send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me
Towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful
I can be your all and all
And give you good lovin' through the summertime
Winter, spring and fall

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Mary J. Blige]
You see I'm searching for a real love
And I don't know where to go
I've been around the world and high and low
And still will never know
How it feels to have a real love
Cuz it seems there's none around
I gotta end it in this way
Because seems he can't be found

[Chorus: Repeat Until Fade]

[Puffy: Outro]
It's that flavor
That's what I'm talking about
Ain't no other way to explain it

[J. Lo (Nate)]
Now only God can hold me
(You make me go "baby")

[Jennifer]
I've seen so many men and it's like they're all the same
My appetite for loving is now my hungers pain
And when I'm feeling sexy who's gonna comfort me
My only problem is their insecurities

[Nate Dogg]
Tell me who is that girl, standing cross the way
She like what I got, got, got, watch her become my slave
Baby girl it's me, yeah that crazy nigga Nate
I won't 'lax so don't talk back let's be on our way

(Chorus)

[Nate Dogg]
You make me go "baby, baby," cause you're a sexy girl
You make me go "baby, baby," cause you're a sexy girl
You make me...

[Jennifer]
Now people loving me, and hating me, treating me ungratefully
But not knowing that they ain't making or breaking me
My life I live is to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again, baby, now I can breathe again

(Chorus) x2

(Bridge - till fade)

[Nate Dogg]
You make me, eww
You make me go

[Nate Dogg]
Watch out 'fore I ball
I'm looking for a girl who's got it all
Ain't flashing no bills
Just testing my skills
I'm looking for a sexy girl to take and peel

You were off in the wind

That woman's got me messed up in my head I forgot about my thought
And what I said all I could remember is one night more then (yea)
One hour on one floor (yea break it down)
There was one red light by the bed
That was glowing of her skin when I did my thang
We was dripping with a little bit of sweat and a whole lot of lost
Cause I really most of diggin her friend
All I wanna say is that we handle ours
And there ain't too many women that could handle stars
And what I wouldn't just one more time
For the chance to grip their handle bars

(Let's go)

[Chorus]
It was supposed to be
Just a one night

And smile for you when your skies are gray, bae

So baby, listen carefully, while I sing my complex song

Shadez of Brooklyn:
Yo, I know this chick named Monique
She lives right across the street, she's a freak, eyein' me like the sheek
(So hit that) Inbetween her sheets, the skins was cheap
Like a tray bag of weed, or a T-shirt right up off the street

She took a bite now they call her Applebum
Never lay in the dumb, sodimize her for the funds
Lifestyle sudductive, low budget high class
Is all for a nut kid, she's the eve of destruction (ya lied to me)

Tried to paly me like I'm nothin'
This rap stuntin', cock them legs, ready to spread
Then you ask cause you a chickenhead
Now for your main concern, this love trial has been ajurned
Mark Morrison and Shadez, round mack and return
So burn baby burn

Ya lied to me
But I do, but I do do do

She's got the look, she's so fine
And you know damn well the girl will be mine
She's got the breaks, she's the scene
And you know damn well she gives it to me
Uh-huh!
Black jeans and a turtleneck sweater
I know the girl is fakin' cause
I've seen her look better
She's composition, she's statistical fact
Got it ready for the willing
Got it kicking in the back

And you know damn well you know what I mean
Hot in the face, one to three
Like a pleasure trip like you've never seen
Uh-huh!
Satin lace and a paisley cut top
The girl is wasting over
'Cause she knows she looks hot
She's got position, she's got just what it takes
Got a mojo in her pocket
Got it ready just in case

Uh-huh!
You got me lookin' like buckwheat, oh
Hair pulled every which way but me

Far from Medusa, but your looks are deadly
You're walkin' soft, still I hear the medley

Hope you're all alone, cause I got plans for you
We could stay at home, or dance and hang all night
As long as I'm with you, doesn't matter what we do"

(Bridge)

[J. Lo]
Don't ask me where I've been
Or what I'm gonna do, just know that I'm here with you
Don't try to understand
Baby, there's no mystery, cause you know how I am

(Chorus)

[Jennifer (P. Diddy)]
I'm real - what you get is what you what you see
What you tryin to do to me
You wanna say you're mine
Be with me all the time
You're fallin so in love
Say you just can enough
You're tellin all your friends (She's a bad, bad bitch)

[P. Diddy]
All my niggas take a walk wit me (what)
You ain't gotta holla you could talk wit me

And how I stack figgas (uh-huh)
Learn why I'm real, still that nigga (still that nigga)

And this is what we came to do (what)

[Jennifer]
You like the way I dress, the way I wear my hair
Show me off to all your friends and, baby I don't care
Just as long as you tell them who I am
Tell them I'm the one that made you give a damn
(Bridge)

(Chorus) x2

[Usher]
You tell her "you look hot don't you worry at all"
?As long as we be shook? then get ready

Shorty she looks stunning, really fine
Coming before the game that means I got you
Need not take to running cause I'm the one

(Chorus)

(Bridge)

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're, approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're, approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Little baby with the sun dress on
Looking so damn right you're wrong
Make me wanna write my own little song for you
The way the thing just wiggle in the air
Turn around and then you flip your hair
I could think of a couple positions for you
You're wasting no time talking to me
Must be something you want me to see
Well, baby girl, don't mind me if I do
So take the stage just show me what you got
Feeling lucky let me touch your spot
Might be leaving with me before the night is through

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're, approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Your body's saying things I ain't never heard
You did the shake-shake and I kinda went berserk
Gotta give it to you, girl, you're one of a kind
When you took my hand up so calm
Touched it to your cherry lip balm
A million nasty things went through my mind
So baby, tell me what you're doing later on
'Cause I'm thinking me and you could get along
Baby girl, don't mind me if I do
So take the stage just show me what you got
Feeling lucky let me touch your spot
Might be leaving with me before the night is through

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're, approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
Yeah, Bubba come stumblin' in
Get up, huntin "Betty" with Justin and them
We must, be the flyest of Southerner men
That's your girl, well buddy, don't fumble it then
You better get her, I'm totally into my zone
Come on girl, close your eyes pretend that your home
I will be puttin' my signature on
That thing I don't even wanna finish the song, let's go
I'm gettin discouraged with her
Too late now we're friends, I surely prefer
Listen to every word that I slur
Other dudes be huggin' and nourishin' her
Not me, I bet you remember the night
Good ol' Bubba K, came into her life
Test the water let me know if the temperature right
Thank you ma'am, its certainly been a delight, uh-huh

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me
I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me

[Verse 4: General]
Sex with me, not hard to see
Roll with a G, roll a tree
Soak the sheets, stroking deep
Nah, y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Trying to creep, blow the feet
Working O.T., supposed to be
Hit it from the back, spank the cheeks
Pull her hair, pushed it deep
Pound the meat, sound asleep
Found a beach, grind and freak
Ménage à trois, roll with R
Posed the part like a porno star
Doing shit, never done before
Get it all now, going on tour
Major Leagues cats, going to war
Drop-top 6, Bentley Azure

[Intro: Nas + Alicia Keys]
Nasty (yeah, yeah)

Ayo, black, it's time again! (Yeah, yeah)
(New York, New York, New York, New York)
Yeah. Premier! (Yeah, yeah)
(New York, New York, New York, New York)
(Ayo, black, it's time)

[Verse 1: Nas]
If you knew my streets
You would know all everybody talk about is who got beef
Who's snitchin', who told police
Who came home, who's still gone, who rest in peace
Now they killin' over music money, not drugs, rap replaced it
Cause thugs with no brains got no patience
New jacks I pistol whip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition of pain
I'm like Saddam Hussein
Still alive lookin' at his dead children's burnt remains
I burnt the game, learnt you lames a new lesson
Your crew's soft man, ya'll need some new weapons
The Ps breed warriors in skullies and Timbies
Around micks, spics, niggas, and guineas
For my ghetto kings in deep thought we don't blink
But don't think we wastin' our time
It's a New York state of mind

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
New York, New York, New York, New York City, whoa, ohh
New York, New York, New York, New York City, gritty

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
It's like a jungle out here
So much struggle out here
And my dreams steal my rest
Sleep's the cousin of death
Always feels like a race against father time
In the Streets of New York
(New York state of mind, New York state of mind)
All I see is street hoes
And bullet holes in our people
Only crime fills the brain
Feels like I'm goin' insane
The revolution has to start, don't waste no time
In the Streets of New York
(New York state of mind)
New York state of mind
(New York state of mind)
C'mon

[Altered Chorus: Alicia Keys]
New York, New York, New York, New York, ohh
State of mind (New York City)
New York, New York, New York, New York, ohh
State of crime (New York City)
New York, New York, New York, New York, ohh
Big dreams (New York City)
New York, New York, New York, New York, ohh
Big schemes

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
Oh, it's like the game
Just ain't the same
Baby thugs and girls with no shame
Can't get away (Get away)
Epidemic plague (Plague)
Every hood in every state
Don't have no reasons cause believin's hard to find
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind)

[Verse 3: Rakim]
I'm from the home of a million legends and trend settin'
A lot of footsteps to follow, I been steppin'
Mind stressin' tryna find direction, crime spreadin'
Time precious, I ain't have rest since 9/11
I live fast, hustle like today is my last
I get cash, the struggle's like a day on the Ave
Crack, D and raw, gats squeezin' off
Manhattan streets in awe from casualties of war
The eve of the Apocalypse, evil people in politics
Every block is at risk, the metropolitan metropolis
The opposite of Liza Minnelli and Frank Sinatra
Alicia Keys, Nas and Ra the gangsta's opera
So New York City walk with me, talk gritty
It's up to us New York it's our city
Here the man come with the anthem, hands up
It's time, the thrill is back New York, let's stand up

[Chorus & Outro/Coda: Alicia Keys & Rakim]
New York, New York, New York, New York City, whoa ohh
(Uh. Yeah.)
New York, New York, New York, New York City, gritty
(Crucial Keys. Ya God, Rakim Allah)
New York, New York, New York, New York City, whoa ohh
(New York City. Nasty Nas)
New York, New York, New York, New York City, gritty
(A. Keys. Yeah, c'mon)

Throwing ass like that, you must be a rock star, baby

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Luda, hey

Stunting in Roberto Cavalli mami with the dime frame
Hotter than tamales, you probably should be my wild thang
Tell them other chicks to mind they business and let us do our thang
I gotcha open, you're open, stroking, now you're soaking wet
And I'm not from Texas but I hold 'em, rope 'em, and I yoke they neck
You gon' make a player choose, show me what that thang'll do
Class is in session, let me show you a thang or two
I'll strip ya, I'll strip ya down to your bare minimums
And I'll, I'll lick ya, I'll lick ya down, you taste like cinnamon
And I'll grab a little bit of that whipped cream
Then I'll put her on the back, get mean
Then I'll get her in a matrix, cut her like LASIK
Basically make her scream
At the top of her lungs, give her shortness of breath
How many times can you cum before I poke you to death?
Someone call in the ref, Ludacris is tired of playing
In the middle of the stage with an ass like that, you got everybody saying

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Hey, you's a rock star, baby
Up in the building making the club go crazy
Hey, you's a rock star baby
Throw an ass like that, you must be a rock star, baby

Fucking with this weed and Patron got me hazy
Hey, I'm a rock star, baby
So put 'em up if you's a rock star, baby

[Verse 2: R Kelly]
Girl, yo booty so swoll', how you got them jeans around it?
Girl, yo booty so swoll', why you think I'm singing about it?
Hit it hard from the back and then I go to sleep and dream about it
It's like that ass is crack the way you got me fiendin' about it
I'm telling you now, the way we fuck gon' lead to child birthing
Rocking to this guitar is about to have me crowd surfing
Kells'll put on a show up until the closed curtains
Then right after the show, backstage, ass hurtin'
Call me Scotty 'cause g-girl I'm 'bout to beam up
Once I get ya, get ya, I'm coming up out them D cups
Stroking it hard, stroking it hard while you go your legs up
Making ya, making ya sound like you got the hiccups
Know what you want 'cause I'm 'bout to give you what you need
Up in my room, you're screaming, "Hercules! Hercules!"
Man, get Kells and Luda on a track, a hit is guaranteed
Everybody on your feet, this is what your shirt should read

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Hey, you's a rock star baby
Up in the building making the club go crazy
Hey, you's a rock star baby
Throw an ass like that, you must be a rock star baby
Say, I'm a rock star baby
Fucking with this weed and Patron got me hazy
Hey, I'm a rock star baby
So put 'em up if you's a rock star baby

[Bridge: R. Kelly & Kid Rock]
I got my drink in my cup
I got my hands in the air
I'm 'bout to set this bitch off
Like I'm a rock star, baby
We out of this club
'Bout to hit the after party
All the ladies comin' with me
'Cause I'm a rock star, baby
So put your hands up
(So put your hands up, so put your hands up)
Everybody in the building, come on, bounce with me
If you's a rock star

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Hey, you's a rock star, baby
Up in the building making the club go crazy
Hey, you's a rock star, baby
Throw an ass like that, you must be a rock star, baby

[Mary]
Ooh, ooh

[Rah Digga]
Uh, uh, uh The Rah D-I-G
Here to rap on behalf
All the females headed down the wrong path
Things gonna change when we hit the set
Put an end to the pain and the disrespect
My Flipmode brother gonna switch his pitch
Like we ain't supposed to know when he talking to a chick
Too fly for that to even make that an issue
Take little chicken head baby moms with you

[Mary]
Loving you is what I thought
In my mind was a miracle
But times have changed and you have changed with them too
How foolish of me
To think that you would be
Someone that I can hold on to
Something in my mind
Was warning me all the time
That you were no angel and neither was I
I tried and tried and tried
To bring peace into our lives
But you continued to flip and try to take control of my life and I
1 - 

[Mary] (Rah Digga)
I don't know
Where we went wrong
All that I can say
He never loved me anyway
(He didn't love you, he didn't love you, come on)

[Mary]
I had been with you
Through everything that you've been through
But it hurts me to my heart that you don't realize
That I've only stayed around, not to cry tears of a clown
But to someday end up being your wife but you lie
Liar, cheater, deceiver and a woman beater
About to give up
Because you want me to sell it short
Boyfriend, little boy
I've been played like a toy
Wondering in your heart
To give someone else a brand new start

Repeat 1 (2x)

[Rah Digga]
How ill is this?
Playing games with my mental
All them other heartbreaker dealers I've done went through
I'm just too fly for that
Now all the ladies say, I'm just too fly for that
And now don't be surprised
Catching you in all kinds of lies
If a honey come flip, start chasing you with knives
You gonna feel the wrath that's word is bond
Cause ain't nothing worse than a ghetto chick scorned
Repeat 1 till end

[Intro: Robin Thicke Ludacris Polow da Don]
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa Remix
Yeah Luda, Ha!

Ready to get up off them feet and I'm so on time
Tick-tock go the clock, it's Ludacris

And I'mma dance all down yo spine
And you can scream and beg for mercy
But I won't stop til I make you mine

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
Stressed out, uptight, overworked, riled up
Unleash what you got let's explore your naughty side

Let me be your medicine
Cause I got one thing on my mind, I'll be your valentine
Spread your wings and baby, fly away

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
It's your body, we can love if you want to

As hard as you want to, soft as you want to
Just let me love you, lay right here, I'll be your fantasy
Give you sex therapy, give you sex therapy

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
It's so therapeutic, how I do it
Get into it, you gots to
Hit the music, cuz you gon' lose it
From deep tissues, or shiatsu
Don't care if the neighbors watchin'
And I won't stop til the cops come knockin'
Make a wish list then I got gifts
When it's Ludacris, miss I'mma stuff yo stockin'
Give you any and everything you ever really wanted
Or imagined that you could have in a lifetime
I'll be your one and only lover and your one and only plumber
When you need me I'll be movin through your pipeline
Whether it's night time or the daylight
When it's the right time, what it taste like
Gimme a taste test and I'mma get you
Got the banana, now let me split you

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you get away from me
Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you go, no

Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you get away from me
Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you go, no

Looking in my mirror
Thinking 'bout last night
I can't help but see you
Running often through my mind

Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you get away from me
Can't have you, if I wanted to

You were saying Mary
Don't let go, hold tight
I just wanna hold you
All through the night

This is something that I can't deny
Boy you know your touch just drives me wild
Won't you take my hand I'll set you free
I want you to belong to me

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Can't have you, if I wanted to

Can't let you get away from me
Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't let you go, no

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Oh, oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Uh, uh-huh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-huh, uh
Yo, yo, yo
You might bump into the Kiss late night
Or on the DN speeding
In the drop, four thirty on my way to rock a birdie
With automatic lead in the car, bread in the car
Plus I'm gettin' head in the car
My wedding tomorrow
More dutchies to the head, the ready you are
After the session with shorty
I'll be better tomorrow
And you know how we are
We always keep one or two
That don't say much
Like to hit a blunt or two
Or don't mind driving with raw in the trunk
Or freaking off for the week
Top floor in the trunk
Just laying back blowing
Twenty five's a skull
The our keys by the door with bow ties and posts
Can't let me get away
But you ain't ready for Kiss
Got the Chevy and the six
Wrists heavy and shit
Matter of fact we gonna take a trip
And put the dats up
And cop the pink lemonade Cadillac truck
Repeat 1 (2x)

Repeat 2

Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't have you
Can't let you go, no
Can't have you, if I wanted to
Can't have you
Can't let you go, no

Repeat 1 till end

[Verse 1: DMX]
Uh.. Uh
Now there's two ways we can do this, keep it real or front
I know you got what I need and I got what you want
And the hunt for soulmates is all over for us
We could go away where nobody would know it was us
Leave behind all the fuss, the studios, the pictures
No autographs, just laughs when I'm wit ya
I know what it's like when they know you now
But bark it at the dog baby, and I'll hold you down

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Time and time and time again
I knew that our love had to end
But now it's gone so very far
That I can make a brand new start
I thought that we were meant to be
Be one big family
But I was weak and loved you still
No matter what you did, I could forgive

[Hook]
All I need is sincerity
All I need is sincerity

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige]
Thinking 'bout you all the time
Never seemed to cross my mind
How you could take the time to kill
Everything our love had built
I never knew how you could hide
Every time you told a lie
But now I know why you're so cold
But I don't understand

[Bridge]
Now that you set me free
I truly think that we
Could find love separately
I need sincerity
One thing, I'm not as weak
I'll always stand alone
But my heart is not made of stone
So I'll go on

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Nas]
Chipped tooth don
Nasty, blue ice timbs on
Screw it face, half moon part, my tattoos dark
On a scale of tough criminals, nothing to call me
I'm a rare individual, young and I'm bossy
Guess it come from a rough life, cuffed at night
Letting off hot lead that bust from iron pipes
I'm the type that have to shed blood
Pray to the ghost of dead thugs, dead blocks that spread drugs
Fled from the cops 'till when my first joint dropped
I'm still wit my hood, Hollow Point still in the Glock
But I've been shitted on by these high class hoes
Even these chickens did me wrong, I was just getting on
So I turned cold, giving 'em hard dick and straight to the hole
Like Rod Strickland, it was taking it's toll
I needed someone I could hold in my darkest hours
A strong couple is a blessing and the heart is the power
Give me someone I could trust, not just a hotty to bone
Does she love Escobar, or love Nasir Jones?
Let me know so I could cop her the stones
What's clear to me, it's sincerity
Somebody I could call my own, yeah

[Hook]

Ghetto fabulous, glamourous, it's effortless

Designer scarf, work of art, rockin' vintage Gucci

Chandeliers in my ears from Bailey Banks & Biddle's
Ya feelin' my style, ya feelin' my flow
Hair chic, smells sweet, like flow to flow
I'm the lady sippin' Bailey's while I strut like a model
If the ladies wanna hate me, I just send them a bottle

In December, every sign has its own mode
I was in love with a Sagittarius
See the emotions he put me through
From Capricorns to Aquarius
They all got their different minds
The affection of a Virgo
Which sign matches good with mine?

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I was in love with a Sagittarius, he blew my mind
He also had a flip side too much like a Gemini
He was freaky like a Taurus, the way he handled me, yeah
Flirtatious like an Aries
Which sign is best for me?

And know how to show me love, 'cause I've been hurt by a Pisces

I wish he was a Virgo, the same sign as me
And know how to show me love, 'cause I've been hurt by a Pisces

He's so unpredictable
He reminds me of every sign

Well I know you lookin' thick now
But I'm wit you to the end

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
You still got it (You still got it, girl)

Don't you know that You still got it
(Yeah, them jeans is snug)

But you scared to try 'em on now
'Cause , it just want fit you right
And you steady watchin' Oprah
Tryin' to redefine your life
But as long as you're my lady

No need to cry, I dig the thighs
That's why I'm tellin' you!

You still got it (You still got it, girl)

[Common]
I look at my lady, and then my day begin to shine
I told her, "Baby, bein' beautiful is only a state of mind"
And you are so, had to let your mind and your heart know it
The more you grow, the more I see God glow
I know it's probably strange, seein' your body change
Can't fit your clothes, nose ain't the same
My loves still remains, it won't vary with me
Looked and smiled and said "Damn, she carryin' me"
A life that we created, we can cherish forever
You're growin', but it's sexy, the sex is even better
But through thick and thin, pickles and peanut butter
It's a divine mother, queen and supreme lover, you still got it!

[Jamie Foxx]
I, know, that, you, still, got it (Baby I know you still got it!)
Don't you know that you still got it (No matter what happens, baby, oh baby!)

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige & Pharrell Williams]
You know I really need you, sugar

For sure ma, let's steal away
Car keys to my man's Benz and peel away
Spillin 'Ze, whether your man like it or not
He ain't diggin' it right, so I'ma be pipin' a lot
Icy and hot, mami, hold on if you able
We put a flake on your hand, I'll floss your navel
**** what it costs, I'm able to make you happy
Whether it's the back of the four-dot-six or the Navi'
Blankets and pillows fluffed up
And we shine like we puffed up
Blowin' that dro 'til we **** up
His luck's up, I just stole his honey
Own his honey, he wildin' like I stole his money
His gold is honeys, my gold is money, he can have my wife
While me and you live that lavish life
With your V. Secret satin tight, thongs and bras
I'm hoping to God this ain't no mirage, uh

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & Pharrell Williams]
Steal away (I wanna steal, I wanna steal)
Steal away (Steal away)

Chorus x2

[Beyonce]
And yo I came from the projects now I want the condos

Yeah
There's three things I like about the summertime
Drop tops, long hot nights and summer love
Yeah
Ayo, B
Tell 'em what time it is
Let's go

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Out of all the guys that approached me
Walkin' up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited a while and took your time
You don't know how impressing
Your curiosity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I

[Refrain: Beyoncé]
I wanted more than just a man (man)
I needed a friend (a friend)
Someone I can talk to (oh)
Someone who'll really listen (yeah)
When you touched my hand (hand)
The sun got brighter then (brighter then)
Trusting you, I closed my eyes
And felt our love begin

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
It was the summertime
When we fell in love, it was the summertime
When heaven shined on us, it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime (summertime)
(Oh)

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Now it's been a year, and we're closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside
For me and now, you are my prize
Wanna grow old wit' ya
Fill a house wit' your pictures
Have a son for you, a little girl for me
Together we'll raise a family

[Refrain: Beyoncé]
I wanted more than just a man
I needed a friend (you are my best friend)
Someone I can talk to (yeah)
Someone who'll really listen (yeah)
When you touched my hand (yeah)
The sun got brighter then (brighter then)
Trusting you, I closed my eyes (yeah)
And felt our love begin

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
It was the summertime
When we fell in love, it was the summertime
When heaven shined on us, it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime (summertime)
(Oh)

[Verse 3: P. Diddy]
Yo, lemme holla at you a sec
So what's it gonna be, him or me? (yeah)
We can cruise the world for pearls
And gator boots for girls
Summertime in the linen, fresh fruit (yeah)
Livin' the life that's forbidden for just you (let's go)
No worries, you ain't gotta be stressed out (uh-uh)
No hurries, you ain't gotta be rushed out (uh-uh)
Sit back, relax, ma, take your time
Now, have a taste of the finest wine
Every minute that we have's a blessing to me (a blessing to me)
And in your heart, you's a "Child of Destiny" (that's right)
Them hot summers that we had especially (yeah)
Love who you is, girl, you bring out the best in me (thank you)
And it's like that, you know it's like that (that's right)
And that's the plan, where's your hand? Lemme ice that (let's go)
You my heart, ain't no chance you could fight that
The summertime, when you hot, baby, take that, take that
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Oh, it was the summertime
When we fell in love, it was the summertime
When heaven shined on us, it was the summertime
Baby, there is nothing like the summertime (summertime)
(Oh)

I know you heard I'm a gangsta
They say "Stay away from them gangstas"
They never change up, or pull they pants up
Well, baby girl, put ya foot down
Don't let 'em push you around, you know what you like
Baby thug, you know wrong from right
And you done felt wrong before
This can't be what it feel like
And they don't really know whatcha feel like
For instance
They don't know the difference between real life
And the music videos and the raggedy magazines
They have it badder than he seems
All they see is my baggy jeans, my attitude
I ain't mad at you, it's just my glide
Way I wear my hat to the side
The way I lean real low when I ride
That's why in my mind
They like my walk
My accent from New York
My way of thinking is slightly off
They like the way he floss
Leave the block on a bike, he come back in a Porsche
But of course
But, most of all, they like my honesty, integrity, my loyalty
Young Hova and the letter B
How you like that, huh?

[Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]

[Verse 1: Grand Puba]
Well, I be Puba on this here, the nigga from last year
Girbauds hangin' baggy, Tommy Hilfiger top gear
Take no shorts, I'm doin' lovely in all sports
Even swing the pole at the hole on my golf course
Some say I'm fair, see, 'cause I'm horny and nasty
If I see some rugged joints, then I won't let it pass me
I take no shorts, let suckers step up to see
I'll flip the script, and get harder than Jeopardy
I shot the sheriff and the mutherfuckin' deputy, test me, check it
I'm not Keith Sweat, but bet that ass that I can make it last
Skinz turn their head so fast, they end up catchin' whiplash
If hun's a monster, I'm Carl Lewis on the meter dash
It's Grand Puba, baby, and I'm gettin' crazy cash
What's the 411? Let me know, hun
What's the 411?

[Hook]
What's the 411, hun?

I said I got it goin' on
Ay, yo, I got it goin' on

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Yeah, nigga, what makes ya different from the next nigga?
Seen ya last week, and ya couldn't even speak
Ya try ta play like Mr. All Of That
But now ya wanna come to me with some chitchat?
I don't have no time for no 'Wam-bam-thank-you-ma'am'
Gas me up, get me drunk and hit the skins and scram
The same ol' shit you pulled last week on Pam
I'm not havin' that, no, I'm not havin' that
Ya gotta do a lot more, and that's just how it be
I'm Mary Blige and you just ain't runnin' up in me
I need a man whose lookin' out with some security
So come correct with some respect, and then we will see
So if you wit' it, then drop the seven digits
And I might just give you a call
If you ain't wit' it, then don't waste your time at all
So what's the 411, hun?

[Bridge: Grand Puba & Pop]
Hey, yo, honey was talkin' a little somethin', man
Yo, so what's up? Push up, man

[Hook: Grand Puba & Mary J. Blige]
All my love is all I have
And Grand Puba's very special
All my life I look for you
And today your dream comes true
You need me and I need you
Grand Puba is very special
Things just seem to do divine
This is how the two combine
I know our love was meant to be
Mary Blige is somethin' kinda special
Love is life and life is livin'! You're very special
You know it, baby, you got it goin' on a little somethin'
So baby, you know what I'm sayin'?

[Intro: Pharrell]
Let's party

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Imagine the Backstreet Boys here with the Neptunes
Call it the rec room, play time now, holla
Pusha be one if you follow, slo' mow, low-low
Thousand spoke on the gold Impala
Crushin', love my women in couples (what)
One on each arm, keep double the trouble (yeah)
So I gotta, shift 'em and shuffle, love how I twist 'em and tussle
Sex play, next day, call me, uh

[Verse 2: AJ McLean]
Let me tell you the story
About the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home
When there she was standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?"
I should've said no, someone's waiting for me
But I called my girl up and said

[Chorus: Backstreet Boys]
"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!" (Hello?)

[Verse 3: Nick Carter]
Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

[Chorus: Backstreet Boys]
"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

[Bridge: Pharrell & Backstreet Boys]
Dance
(Hello?) Listen baby I'm sorry
Dance
(Hello?) Listen baby I'm sorry

[Verse 4: Malice]
Don't stay up and wait
'Cause I'ma be somewhere late
I feel for ya if you can't relate
I take it aways, like two day stays
But look, still hit me on my two-way page
See, I'm heavy in the streets like a cream Denali (uh)
Cold outside? We take trips to Maui (c'mon)
AJ, Brian, Kevin, Nick and Howie (what)
Accompanied by Clipse; Pusha T and Mali

[Reprise: Nick Carter & AJ McLean]
Let me tell you the story
About the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home
When there she was standing there in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby"
Gotta go

[Chorus: Backstreet Boys]
"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby

"Listen, baby, I'm sorry

I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

[Outro: Backstreet Boys & (Pharrell)]
We're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby, gotta go
We're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby, gotta go
(Say what?)
We're going to a place nearby (Say what?)
We're going to a place nearby (Say what?)
Gotta go (Gotta go!)
Hello?
Hello?
Haha, yeah

Yeah, plus I'm lookin for the right type
Cautious of a flood so I always lay the right pipe
Wes put me on the marquee flight life
Plus I go hard for the woman that I might wife
I put the ring on her index finger
So if you wanna keep ya girl please don't bring her
I bet I'm the type of guy that she got a thing for
And you would block me, but this ain't Jenga
Yeah, and she's someone I would work with
That's what I can tell from what she's showin' on the surface
I ain't sayin I'm requestin' anyone that's perfect
But I just need a woman that'll make it all worth it

[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Ladies and gentlemen!
The champ is here!
The champ is here!
The champ is here!
Get your motherfucking hands in the air!
The champ is here!
The champ is here!
The champ is here!
You can hate me, I don't care!

[Verse: R. Kelly]
All y'all wanna powl on me, make it hard for me to breathe
Throw sand in my eyes, make it hard for me to see
Out of breath, can't see, still hard to defeat
The history that I made, impossible to impeach
First round, spread rumors, point fingers, throw stones, judge me
Hate me, love me, hug me, curse me
Whatever, 'cause y'all fucking opinions don't feed me
I'm clever, enough to know that the industry needs me
Second round, I'm opposite of the demon that faces me
I've been through hell lived in the belly of the beast
I've confessed my sins but still didn't find peace, but
Like MJ in five, I will six-peat
Third round, I make music from the hood 'cause that's where I'm from
That's why the hood is always first to help me overcome
Fifth round, when I'm down, some of y'all cats act so strange
When I'm up, same cats wonder why I act so strange
Sixth round, Kells done changed, please you bitches is so lame
Something ain't your fault and y'all so quick to blame
That's why I got number one in the back of my Range
Y'all cats is foreplaying, I'm pregnant by the game
Seventh round, some would like to see balled and chained
But I'm a child of God so my destiny is all day
Eighth round, undisputed is the title I claim
'Bout to shoot the world up with this lyrical cocaine
Ninth round, the place is packed
The bell rings I'm about to bring the pain
Left jab, right hook, shutting down your brain
Tenth round, I could be surrounded by lions in the mist of the jungle
And still I'ma rumble your many rumble, eleventh round

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
Ladies and gentlemen!
The champ is here!
The champ is here!
The champ is here!
Get your motherfucking hands in the air
The champ is here!
The champ is here!
The champ is here!
You can hate me, I don't care
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast so I would notice you
But you're hard to miss, think you outta know
Doesn't really matter if you're balling out of control

All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy yeah

When I took a chance
Thought you'd understand
Baby credit cards aren't romance
Still you're tryna buy what's already yours
What I need from you is not available in stores
Seen a side of you that I really feel
You're doing way too much, never keep it real
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys?
I've got to go

You think the money that you make
Can substitute the time you take
To get the keys into my heart
Think you can win my heart
Don't know what's in my heart
I think you need to take some time
To show me that your love is true
There's more than dollar signs in you
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart

[Intro]
(Hoo!)

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
This time around I never get bit
Though you really wanna fix me
This time around you're makin' me sick
Though you really wanna get me
Somebody's out, somebody's out to get me
They really wanna fix me, hit me
But this time around I'm takin' no shit
Though you really wanna get me, you really wanna get me

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, (They thought) they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, (They thought) they really had control of me

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
This time around I'm not gonna get bit
Though you really wanna get me (You really wanna get me)
But this time around I'm takin' no shit
Though you really wanna fix me (You really wanna fix me)
Somebody's out, somebody's out to use me
They get people to use me and then falsely accuse me
This time around don't treat me like spit
Though you really can't control me, you really can't control me

[Chorus]
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me (Get me, and fix me)
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Listen, I got problems of my own
Flashin' cameras, taps on my phone
Even in my home, I ain’t safe as I should be
Things always missin', maybe it could be
My friends, but they ain’t friends if they robbin' me
Stoppin' me, from makin' a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun-totin'
If I was dead broke and smokin'
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'ma kill a nigga, I ain’t jokin'
Indo smoke got me chokin', I'm hopin'
A fool come slippin', so I can blow him open
This time around I changed up my flow
Got rid of the Rotts, got Pits by the door
A real set of peoples to watch my back
Stay away from strangers so I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that
Baby (This time around, yeah!)

[Chorus / Outro]
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
(Get me, and fix me, they really tried to get me)
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
(Use me, accuse me, nobody will abuse me)
He really thought he really had a hold of me
(Take me, shake me, nobody's gonna fake me)
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
(Guilt me, and deal with me, I like the way you thrill me)
(Hit it! Control this now!)
He really thought he really had a hold of me (Hoo!)
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
(Use me, accuse me, nobody will abuse me)
He really thought he really had a hold of me
(Fix me, and wish me, nobody's gonna diss me)
(Hoo!)
This time around, yeah! (Control of me)
He really thought

[Intro: Rod Serling]
Tonight's story is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction
A monster had arrived in the village
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
And this person or thing is soon to be met
He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion
Oh yes, I did forget something didn't I? I forgot to introduce you to the monster

[Verse 1]
You're fearing me, 'cause you know I'm a beast
Watching you when you sleep, when you're in bed, I'm underneath
You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
I'm the floor when you fall, and when you scream, it's 'cause of me
I'm the living dead, the dark thoughts in your head
I heard just what you said
That's why you've got to be threatened by me

[Chorus]
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

[Verse 2]
You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you
Your worst nightmare, it's me, I'm everywhere (Everywhere)
In one blink I’'l disappear, and then I'll come back to haunt you
I'm telling you, when you lie under tomb
I'm the one watching you
That's why you got to be threatened by me
(No, no)

[Chorus]
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

[Rod Serling Verse]
The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark
A nightmare, that's the case
Never Neverland, that's the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in two places at the same time
This is judgment night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that's fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear

[Chorus]
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened (No, no)
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened (Yeah)
Every time your lady speaks, she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened
(You should be)
(E-e-e-e threatened)
(While you sleep)
(E-e-e-e threatened)
(Every time)
(Threatened)
(Half of me-e-e-e)
(So you should feel thre-e-e-eatened by me)
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened (No, no)
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened (Yeah)
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened (She speaks to me)
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened (It's you, hoo-hoo!)
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened (C'mon, baby, yeah)
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened (You should be, hoo-hoo!)
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened (Every time, she speaks to me) (Hoo-hoo!)
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

[Outro: Rod Serling]
What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare
It isn't. It's the beginning

[Intro - R. Kelly]
Yo, I know everybody out there wanna know
What the hell does this mean
I don't know my damn self, haha

[Verse 1 - R. Kelly]
Now what the hell does "Thoia Thoing" mean
It can mean anything you want it to mean, anything you say it mean
That's what it mean, if you say sex, then probably
Some say it means pushin the Lex then probably
This one White chick said, "Gettin real smokey and feelin free"
This Black chick said, "Sippin Hennessey in V.I.P"
Well, well you can say what you want that's what it is
All I know is that the thoia thoing man it's the shit
Afro's, corn rolls, hair weaves, you gotta love it
White, Black, brown, even Japanese you gotta love it
And you know somebody out there going "Man I like the beat"
"The hook is real tight, but I'mma keep it real dogg it puzzles me"
No rules in the music industry y'all know
If it feel good and make you move your feet y'all know
If the bass is bumpin in your jeep y'all know
Then its the Piper and I'm coming with the heat
Thoia thoing, make you wanna club pop make you wanna drop top
Make you get like Beyonce, and do the booty hop
Thoia thoing, inspired by juice and Hypnotic
It's like a virus, and the whole world got it

[Hook] + (w/ Baby ad-libs)
I had her singing
Thoia thoia thoia thoia thoing thoing
Thoia thoia thoia thoia thoing thoing
She had me singing
Thoia thoia thoia thoia thoing thoing
Thoia thoia thoia thoia thoing thoing

[Verse 2 - Baby]
See it's Baby and Kelly, come relax with us shorty
When we drop, it's platiuim plus shorty
Whoa you see the rocks with the rays
Mess up your eyes like a blunt of that haze
Knee high boots, right wheel side Coupe
Custom made seats, with the fall back roof
Fine Dutch, Louie Vaton with steeleto shoes
Iced up Jacob watch march Jacob boots
Mini's On the Jetta, boss just to take a trip
G4 we in the clouds, now we making hits
The Bird landed in Japan, hopped in a Six
Steering wheel, wood grain, in these foreign whips
Kiesha to Italy, Stacy to France, and
Tanya to Paris, her models the badest and
We stopped in Jamaica spent a hundred grand
Got a hundred model chicks, I done flew from Japan

[Hook] + (w/ Busta Rhymes ad-libs)

[Verse 3 - Busta Rhymes]
Shorty I love how you drop it the way you get down and pop it
Lock it and cock it again and again you better stop it girl
I see how you wiggle your coochie, know you should watch it girl
And once we step in the spot, and you know that I got ya (Ahh choo)
Yeah your little Gucci cologne be having me puffy
When sneezing baby it nothing do your thang I ain't gon' stop you girl
All in your mini skirt really squirt, show me something baby
Once I give you what really hurts, you won't owe me nothing (Come on!)
Looking and watching and seeing the way jeans be cutting
All up in yo ass rockin and switchin when you be strutting
(Shake it fast) I know that you willing and able
And ready to (take a glass) sitting on top of ya ass like a table
Now (make it last) performing until the water drip to ya navel
(Take it past) the level of if the label will beat unstable
Now shake ya ass to the joint da joint
Baby do ya thing go head and shake ya tha thoia thiong

[Hook]

[Bridge - R. Kelly]
We make a lot of noise when
We come through the club
All of the ladies in the house
Come show your boy some love
Last call for alcohol
We're closing down the bar
Tell me where's the after party at
We rolling with the R

[Hook - until fade]

[Hook]
If I had my way
Life would be just fine
But the world is too much
And it makes me cry
Sometimes I feel like leaving
But I must be wise
Because time is not on our side (on our side)
(Don't you know that time's not on our side)
Because time is not on our side (on our side)

[Verse 1]
The end is coming, stop your running
I'm telling you this is the truth
You can talk about what you read about
Everything is on the news
People nowadays so shady
Now what is wrong with them
Something cast a spell up on their minds
And they always wanna condemn

[Hook]
If I had my way
Life would be just fine
But the world is too much
And it makes me cry
Sometimes I feel like leaving
But I must be wise
Because time is not on our side (on our side)
(Don't you know that time's not on our side)
Because time is not on our side (on our side)

[Verse 2]
While you're judging me you should look around
And you'll see how people going down
Some of them are killed over a dime
Now tell me do we really have time
To continue with this madness
Cause I'm sick and tired of this
Trying to crush my world with jealousy
And I'm about to catch a fit

[Hook]
If I had my way
Life would be just fine
But the world is too much
And it makes me cry
Sometimes I feel like leaving
But I must be wise
Because time is not on our side (on our side)
(Don't you know that time's not on our side)
Because time is not on our side (on our side)

[Bridge]
You're deceiving
What's the meaning
Of you retrieving
The enemy's greeting
We all are leaving someday but
We don't know how we are going
Please believe me when I tell you
That time is not really on our side

[Hook]
If I had my way
Life would be just fine
But the world is too much
And it makes me cry
Sometimes I feel like leaving
But I must be wise
Because time is not on our side (on our side)
(Don't you know that time's not on our side)
Because time is not on our side (on our side)
If I had my way
Life would be just fine
But the world is too much
And it makes me cry
Sometimes I feel like leaving
But I must be wise
Because time is not on our side (on our side)
(Don't you know that time's not on our side)
Because time is not on our side (on our side)
If I had my way
Life would be just fine
But the world is too much
And it makes me cry
Sometimes I feel like leaving
But I must be wise
Because time is not on our side (on our side)
(Don't you know that time's not on our side)
Because time is not on our side (on our side)
If I had my way
Life would be just fine
But the world is too much
And it makes me cry
Sometimes I feel like leaving
But I must be wise
Because time is not on our side (on our side)
(Don't you know that time's not on our side)
Because time is not on our side (on our side)

[Intro: R. Kelly]
Yo what up, my nigga
You know I was in the hood
I just thought I'd stop by
Holla at you for a minute
Pour out a little liquor or something

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Nigga, we done been through a lot of shit together
From running these streets to being down for whatever
And now that you're gone I got a whole lot of shit to tell you
Things I should've said way back when we was younger
Remember when we used to roll hand in hand
And now I'm tripping on how I really miss you, man
And remember when you and me would say
We'd get up out this hood and everything would be okay
It's all good now (my nigga)
We out the hood now (mmm)
We had the same ideas, but not the same careers
We shared the same old laugh, and now the same tears
You were my homie, my sconey, my Roni
My nigga and never placed no bitch before me
Man, I swear to God I love you for that shit
Why'd you have to get hit
Where was I, what time was it
You were supposed to get older with me
On stage, hands on shoulders with me
Copping them Range Rovers with me
Sitting on thangs and smoking trees
And if it wasn't for the will that God had made
I'd turn back the hands of time and take your place
Sitting here sipping on this Hennessy
Just thinking about how much you meant to me (my nigga)
Even when you're gone you will always be my nigga
Though you made it home I'm still missing you, my nigga
I'm feeling like the timing was wrong, my nigga
I know you're smiling down saying carry on, my nigga
Sometimes my nights can get long, my nigga
Sometimes I feel God did me wrong, my nigga
So I had to write a song, my nigga
Just to let you know that you're still my nigga

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
I wish, I wish, I wish (oh I)
I wish, I wish, I wish

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Little son is looking at me like, "Where's my daddy?"
And your 13-year old daughter is mad 'cause she understands
Promised your mama I'd take care of the family
But she's so hurt, she turns away my helping hands
Damn, I wish your ass was here, my nigga
To grow that gray beard and smoke that cigar, my nigga
And we would talk about you getting up out this game
And you would tell me how it keeps calling you name
(We used to ride-ride-ride)
Never afraid to (die-die-die)
But sometimes we (cry-cry-cry)
Asking the Lord (why-why-why)
They're tearing down these projects
We were homies for like 20 thug years (say word)
Sat in church and cried the same thug tears (say word)
You remember when Vibe world premiered
How we used to share the same old gear
And remember when you and me would say
We'd get up out this hood and everything would be okay
(It's all good now) my nigga
We out the hood now
It's so easy for folks to say, "Rob, just live on"
When I'm dying every second that you're gone
Nevertheless I try my best to be strong
Hoping you said your prayers before you went on home
We done stood on these blocks and just shot the breeze
We'd slap box dead in the middle of streets
And if a fight broke out, you would take up for me
You're all I have left of these ghetto memories

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
I wish, I wish, I wish (oh I)
I wish, I wish, I wish

[Verse 3: Boo & (R. Kelly)]
Uh, uh, yo dog, I can't explain how I miss you
We stayed together, copping 'caine, popping pistols
I miss you most
Putting the doo rag over your bean head
Even out the hood on the scene you brag (whoa)
Coming up off the fiends for bags
Running up out the cleanest Jag
You was the closest nigga I had
Look how we stayed aces
Hustled, made big faces (faces)
I wish we could trade places (places)
Fuck giving you ice, I'd rather give you life
And the things that I had, I'd give you twice (oh yeah)

[Verse 4: Gotti & (R. Kelly)]
So what the deal, my nigga, I know you holding it down
If you could see me you would say I'm talking soft right now (ooh)
But it's hard for me to say when I'ma see you again
And I know it's fucked up, I gotta talk through this pen (ooh, ooh)
But you died for the love of the dough
The love of the block, 16 you was running the spot (spot)
Boy, your mama used to hate how we stood on the curb
Hanging with wild thug niggas, smoking the herb
(Mmm, hmm, hmm)
I'ma keep pouring this liquor and that's my word
This here is for my niggas that be flipping them birds
(Oh) Word up!

[Outro: R. Kelly]
Even though you're gone you will always be my nigga (Whoa…whoa…oh…oh..oh…why…)
Never made it home I’m still missing you, my nigga
I'm feeling like the timing was wrong, my nigga (I'm feeling like the timing was wrong )
Know you're smiling down saying carry on, my nigga
Radio, please don’t take the nigga out this song
Let it play on, play on, play on, play on, play on…whoa…oh
Sometimes my nights can get long, my nigga
Sometimes I feel God did me wrong, my nigga
So I had to write a song, my nigga
Just to let you know that you’re still, my nigga
Yo we miss you nigga, we love you, nigga (for life, nigga)
We’ll never let you go, baby, we gon always remember (Rest In Peace)
Chitown wherever Boo, word up, we love you

[Intro: Usher, Just Blaze, & Sample]
Real talk, Usher
Just Blaze, you know
Oh, oh ohh
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)
It's the last words she said to me
Now I'm wishing she was still here with me
(You're gonna need me, need me one day)
And now that day's here, your man gotta shed tears, right?!
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)

[Verse 1: Usher]
You never miss a good thing 'til it leaves ya
And finally, I realize that I need ya
I want you back
Baby girl, I need you back
Gotta have you back, babe
Heartbroken when you left my world
Man, I wish I would've kept my girl
I love you
I don't know what I'm gon' do without my baby

[Chorus: Usher]
It's drivin' me crazy (It's drivin' me crazy)
'Cause I'm missin' my baby (Missin' my baby)
I'm goin' out of my mind and I'm runnin' out of time
Oh, I just wish I could find you, girl, oh-oh
Said, I'm 'bout to go crazy ('Bout to go crazy)
'Cause I've been needin' you lately (Needin' you lately)
I'm goin' out of my head and all the things that I said
I wish that I never said 'em now

[Bridge 1: Usher & Sample]
Aww, baby, what you say now?
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
And still, I want you, want you, want you, want you, want you
I need you, babe

[Verse 2: Usher & Sample]
If I could rewind the time and get inside your mind
I would take back all my words
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)
I didn't see it
I couldn't see what I was doin', babe (Oh)
See, baby girl, I was blind and I wish I could try
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)
To be the man that you deserve
Give me one chance to make it work, (Ah, baby)

[Chorus: Usher]
It's drivin' me crazy (It's drivin' me crazy)
'Cause I'm missin' my baby (Missin' my baby)
I'm goin' out of my mind and I'm runnin' out of time
Oh, I just wish I could find you, girl, oh-oh
Said, I'm 'bout to go crazy ('Bout to go crazy)
'Cause I've been needin' you lately (Needin' you lately)
I'm goin' out of my head and all the things that I said
I wish that I never said 'em now

[Interlude: Usher & Sample]
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
(Oh-oh) Wish I could throw it back
I want it the way it used to be, oh, oh
(You're gonna need me)
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)
Give me one chance to make it work

[Verse 3: Jadakiss, Sample, (Usher)]
Oh, yeah, oh, yo
I'm tryna stay strong, I don't wanna crack
But I need her and she told me I was gon' want her back
Should've believed her, now I'm wishin' I could throw me back
To that exact spot where we found L-O-V-E at
Lose some, then I lose again, when am I gonna win some?
(Gonna need me, need me one day)
I said a lot of things out of anger, but I meant some
(You're gonna want me back)
I brought a lot of things to the table besides income (Oh)
I just want things to go back to how they used to be
I was used to you and I thought you were used to me
Time is against me
You never miss something till it's gone
That's my word, ma, you convinced me
It might not happen, but I'm still hopin'
And my heart is broken, but the door is still open
Pillow still soakin', your boy still locing (Oh)
Dutch still lit and a bottle still open
And if I don't get another chance, it'll be hard to get focused

[Chorus: Usher & Sample]
It's drivin' me crazy (It's drivin' me crazy)
'Cause I'm missin' my baby (I'm missin' my baby, yeah)
I'm goin' out of my mind, runnin' out of time
I just wish I could find you, girl, oh baby
Said, I'm 'bout to go crazy ('Bout to go crazy)
'Cause I've been needin' you lately (Needin' you lately)
The love of my life
But I wasn't lovin' you right, baby, yeah, yeah
It's drivin' me crazy (It's drivin' me crazy)
'Cause I'm missin' my baby (Missin' my baby)
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)
I'm goin' out of my mind and I'm runnin' out of time
I just wish I could find you, girl (You're gonna need me)
Said, I'm 'bout to go crazy ('Bout to go crazy)
'Cause I've been needin' you lately (Needin' you lately)
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)
Lately, I'm goin' out of my head, all the things that I said
I wish that I never said 'em now

[Outro: Usher & Sample]
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)
It's the last words she said to me
Now I'm wishing she was still here with me
(You're gonna need me, need me one day)
Now that day's here, your man gotta shed tears
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)
I'm sittin' by the phone
Realizin' she ain't ever coming home
(Oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh)
(You're gonna need me, need me one day)
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)

[Intro - Usher]
Yo.... after tonight
Don't leave your girl 'round me
True playa for real, ask my nigga Pharrell

[Verse 1 - Royce Da 5'9"]
Detroit Rock City ballin, Philly batters and Boston
It don't matter where we at, we travelin often
It don't matter what we pack, the gat'll be coughin'
That'll be that, either that or your faculty's softin'
Ladies stack that, ass phat when they walkin'
Gallopin like horses, Jesus, I just wanna get in between ya
Like, chilly when you thinkin of me
But really you leavin Dallas, Austin, it's happenin often
I really could read you, rather by payment to please
To spoon feed, really who needs you
The longer I get, the longer I please you
Five Nine'll creep wit the people, keepin it diesel
But who could forget you, I'm keepin it street
While I'm shootin this missle, reachin and heat seekin this freaks
Royce 5'9" is literally the head nigga that's breathin
The reason that chivalry is dead, so please

[Usher]
Situations will arise, in our lives
But you got to be smart about it
Celebrations, with the guys, I sacrificed
Cause I knew you could not sleep without it
Meanwhile I, I, I, I, I... I loved you, you were my girl
You see I, I, I, I, I... thought the world of you
But your so steady still leavin' baby

[Chorus - Usher]
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight

[Verse 2 - Usher]
Aw girl your face is, sayin' why
Tears in eyes, should've been more smart about it
Should've cherished me, listenin' to friends, now it's the end
And again no story can end without it
Damn ri..i, i, i, ight... I loved U, you were my girl
U see I, I, I, I, I... thought the world of you
But you're so steady still leavin' baby

[Chorus - Usher]
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight

[Bridge - Usher]
Gonna boogie... tonight
Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy
To stay home, waitin' for love
So tonight, I'm gonna do what a single man does
And that's party!!!

[Chorus - Usher] w/ (ad-libs)
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight

[Bridge - Usher]
I'm alri-ight-ight
Gonna boogie.. tonight
Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy
To stay home, waitin' for love
So tonight, I'm gonna do what a single man does...
And that's party!!!

[Chorus - Usher] w/ (ad-libs)
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight
You don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'ma be alright tonight

[Intro: R. Kelly]
Rock on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Chillin' at the club
Showing niggas how we ball
Ever since the drought
It's been nothing but the trump

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Can you really blame me for getting these G's
Something I don't understand
Why you fools after me
VIP, got the haters after me
'Cause I push these V's
They wanna be like me
If you agree
Then raise the roof with me
In the party place to be
Living VIP

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Since when did money, oh
Become such a problem
I just wanna live a life
That only involve the numbers, yeah

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Can you really blame me for getting these G's
See what I can't understand
Why you fools don't rock with me
VIP, I got the haters after me
Because I push these V's
They wanna be like me
If you agree (If you agree)
Then raise the roof with me (Raise the roof with me)
In the party place to be (In the party place to be)
Living VIP

[Verse 3: Tone]
Haha, nothing but the
Stretch Bentleys with the top that's drop, that's right
Kelly CD's with the sound that knocks
Di di di di di di di
When the party rocks
Fingers to the wrist filled with nothin but rocks
I know you haters wanna come to Rockland's party
But you can't get in unless you VIP

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Can you really blame me for getting these G's
See what I can't understand
Why you fools are after me, livin' V
So if you're ballin' and you know, raise your hands
And if you sexy and you know it, stomp your feet
And if your man ain't spendin' money on you
Then ladies, you can come and get with me
A little V

[Verse 4: R. Kelly]
Yo, uh huh, wish I could call up all the haters
I mean, I wish I could make a phone call
To all the haters around the world
You know what I'm saying?
This is what I'd say
What's goin' on in the world today, huh?
Seems like every nigga got beef cuz they ain't got steak
When I ain't had no money see, everything was cool
But now that I got a little money and y'all wanna act a fool
And none of 'em VIP

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
VIP, I got the haters after me
Because I push these V's (What?)
They wanna be like me (Raise the roof, y'all)
If you agree (Now let's lock)
And raise the roof with me
(Over this here's, just bring it on)
In the party place (Uh, Rockland)
To be living VIP, VIP
I got the haters after me
Because I push these V's
They wanna be like me
(Wanna be a.....)

[Intro]
Right, oh y'all know what I'm sayin'
Trackmasters, what up?

[Method Man]
Yo, you remind me of this chick I knew, used to pursue
She wouldn't let the Meth' Man screw, but let the crew
So I did what any man in that situation would do
Go find him something new that's gon' keep it gangsta, too
Don't take it personal, I just call it the way I see
And what I see is not a potential wife to be
So basically, there it is and there it go
I'll pass this time, but next lifetime who knows?
Anything I suppose

[Usher]
See, the thing about you, that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl I'm-a try
You need to sit down, this may take a while....
See, this girl she sorta looks like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

[Hook 1 - Usher] (Blu Cantrell)
You remind me of a girl that I once knew (Once upon a time)
See her face whenever I, I look at you
Wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
(You remind me, yeah) This is why I just can't get with you

[Blu Cantrell]
I can recall a certain magic in your eyes
Although we are just meeting, I feel as though I already know you
It's such a shame that you remind me of a past love, my worst love
So sorry, but I can't get with you cause remind me, yeah

[Hook 2 - Blu Cantrell]
You remind me of a guy that I once knew (you remind me, yeah)
See his face whenever I, I look at you
Wouldn't believe all of things she put me through (yeah)
This is why I just can't get with you

[Bridge - Usher] {Method Man}
I know it's so unfair to you (ha)
It's so unfair
That I relay her ignorance to you (whoa, I)
Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me.... (you remind....)
{Yes, yes y'all, don't stop y'all
To the beat y'all, Trackmasters and ya don't stop}

[Method Man]
It's just somethin' about ya
That got me not knowin' if I wanna kiss ya or slap the shit out ya
My bad, I'm losin' myself, don't get me wrong
It's just that oil and water don't get along
Take it from somebody that know, been there befo'
I used to where my heart on my sleeve, not anymo'
Ask Usher and Blu, nothin' hurt me more than your love do
I put that on my life and The 'W'
You remind me

[Hook 1 - Usher] {Blu Cantrell}
{I can't get with you}
You remind me of a girl that I once knew {Once upon a time}
See her face whenever I, I look at you (Said I...)
Wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
{Sweet thing this is why} This is why I just can't get with you

[Hook 2 - Blu Cantrell] {Usher}
{Gotta let you go}
You remind of a guy that I once knew
See his face whenever I, I look at you (You remind me, yeah)
Wouldn't believe all of the things he put me through (Everything that you do, yeah)
{This is why I just can't get with you}

[Mr. Cheeks]
Yea, Mr. Cheeks, Mr. Saks
Usher, the remix
It sounds like a winner to me
Ok
You remind me of this chik I used to deal wit
Hang out and chill wit, smoke and eat a meal wit
Cop the rings-n-things, took her to the Ruckers games
I'm findin out cuz it ain't nothin but some other mothafucka's names
Neva thought that she was grimey from the way she looked
Sex a nigga, gravy and every day she cooks
Come to find out my honey wasn't playin fair
Grab ya clothes and ya keys you ain't staying hear

[Usher]
See this girl she, sorta looks just like you
She evan smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

[Hook]

[Usher]
U remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I I look at you
Won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

[Usher]
Thought that she was the one for me
Till I found out she was on her creep
Ooo she was sexing everyone but me
This is why we could never be

[Hook]

I know (yeah) it's so unfair to you (it's so unfair)
That I relate her ignorance to you
Wish I knew (Wish I knew how to separate the two)
U remind me (U remind)
Whoaaa Whoaaaaaaaaaaaaa

[Cheeks]

Yea, I'm talkin
Pokin those trips, I'm lovin those hips
A hot chik's up in my corner and my dough flips
The type of chik that every cat wanna keep wit dem
She had a lot a male friends that wanna freak wit dem
I wanna hold you the way you wanna hold me
I've played the fool before I'm not trying ta O.D
And being unfair to you that's what I hate ta do
I swear I wish I had a way to seperate the two
I swear I wish I had a way to seperate the two
Yo

[Hook]

(Gotta let you go)
(Said a Iiiiiiiiiiiii huh)

[Hook]

You remind me of a girl yeah)

(This is why I just can't get with you no no)

[Hook] till end

[Intro: Michael Jackson]
Yeah, yeah, ah

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Now I'm just wonderin', ah, why you think, uh
That you can get to me, uh, with anything? Nah
Seems like you'd know by now when and how I get down, nah
And with all that I've been through, ah, I'm still around

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby, I got what it takes
And there's no way, you'll never get me (Come on, uh)
And why can't you see that you'll never, ever hurt me?
'Cause I won't let it be, see, I'm too much for you, baby (Take on)

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
You can't believe it, ah
You can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, ah
'Cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, ah
And you can't take it
You'll never break me, ah
'Cause I'm unbreakable

[Break: Michael Jackson]
Doo-doo-dah
Oh, dah, ah, a-da, well, ah, ah

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
Now you can't stop me, nah, even though you think, ah
That if you block me, ah, you've done your thing, ah
And when you bury me underneath all your pain
I'm steady laughin', hah, while surfacing

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby, I've got what it takes (Yeah)
And there's no way, you'll never get me (You can't do it, baby)
And why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me? (Come on)
'Cause I won't let it be, see, I'm too much for you baby

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
You can't believe it, ah
You can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, ah
'Cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, ah
And you can't take it
You'll never break me (You can't break me), ah
'Cause I'm unbreakable
You can't believe it (Yeah, unbreakable)
Ah, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me (You can't touch me)
Ah, 'cause I'm untouchable (Why do you do it, baby?)
And I know you hate it (Come on, now), ah
And you can't take it (Yeah)
You'll never break me
You can't stand it, because I'm unbreakable

[Bridge: Michael Jackson & The Notorious B.I.G]
You can try to stop me, uh
But it won't do a thing
No matter what you do
I'm still gonna be here (Be here)
Through all your lies and silly games
I'ma still remain the same
I'm (Uh) un—(Uh)—breakable (What? Uh)

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
A lime to a lemon, my D.C. women
Bringing in 10 G minimums to condos with elevators in 'em
Vehicles with televisions in 'em
Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly 9's and MAC's
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them? Hello
Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow
Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any telly you in
Crack baggin', sick of braggin' how my mink be draggin'
Desert E's, street sweepers inside the Beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messin' with the devil, what?

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
You can't believe it, ah
You can't conceive it (Yeah)
And you can't touch me, ah (I'm untouchable)
'Cause I'm untouchable ('Cause I'm untouchable)
And I know you hate it, ah
And you can't take it (Yeah)
You'll never break me (Ah), nah
'Cause I'm unbreakable (I'm unbreakable)
You can't believe it, ah
You can't conceive it (You, you, you, you, you!)
And you can't touch me, ah
'Cause I'm untouchable

Yo.. after tonight (Remix)
Don't leave your girl 'round me

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Man I'm a playa, girl you don't have to call
Six G's in my socks so I have to ball

Then hit the liquor store and them Swisher sweet makers
Yeah, me and some friendly friend friends
Close as the hairs on my chinney chin chin
I'mma be aight tonight we down South
But I plan to get head straight up like Alfalfa

[Verse 2: Usher]
Situations will arise, in our lives
But you got to be smart about it
Celebrations, with the guys, I sacrificed

Meanwhile I, I, I, I, I...I loved U, you were my girl

And again no story can end without it
Damn ri..i,i,i,ight... I loved U, you were my girl

[Hook: Usher]

Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy
To stay home, waitin for love
So tonight, I'm gonna do what a single man does

[Verse 4: Ludacris & Usher]
Damn! What's with all the long faces?
You're wookin pa nub in all the wong places
Let's hit clubs and girls will take a shirt off
If not for me for the raspberry Smirnoff
Then me and Ursher can knock 'em all
Then we up and disappear like socks and drawers
A-Town!! Hit the block and get rowdy
We puttin up A's like Summa Cum Laude's
Yeah I graduated at the top of the class
And yeah I'll strap a harness to the top of yo' ass
And I, told 'em befo' the parties don't stop
So like Ripley's, you "Believe It Or Not"
And when you don't realize I'm the best ya had
Now you sittin at home and you got it bad
OHH! I'mma get nice and move slow
So drink some prune juice and let the shit go
And that's party!!!

[Hook: Usher]
U don't have to call, it's okay girl
Cause I'mma be alright tonight

[Intro: JAY-Z & (Beyoncé)]
He-he-he...
Yeah, B!
Talk yo' shit! Ha-ha-ha
(Partner, let me upgrade you, upgrade you)
How you gon' upgrade me?
What's higher than number one?
You know I used to beat that block
Now I be's the block
(Partner, let me upgrade you)
Ha-ha-ha

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I hear you be the block, but I'm the lights that keep the streets on
Notice you the type that like to keep 'em on a leash, though
I'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason
Sendin' me a drink ain't appeasin', believe me (Believe me)
Come harder, this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself, trust me, you need me
This ain't no shoulder with a chip or a ego
But what you think they all mad at me for?

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
You need a real woman in your life (That's a good look)
Takin' care of home and still fly (That's a good look)
And I'ma help you build up your account
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look)
Believe me (Ladies, that's a good look)
When you're in them big meetings for the mills (That's a good look)
You take me just to complement the deal (That's a good look)
And anything you cop, I'll split the bill
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look)
Believe me (Ladies, that's a good look)

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars-Piguet you
Switch your necktie to purple labels
Upgrade you
(I can) up, (Can I?) up, (Let me) upgrade you
(Partner, let me upgrade you, upgrade you)
Partner, let me upgrade you, flip a new page
Introduce you to some new things and
Upgrade you
(I can) up, (Can I?) up, (Let me) upgrade you
(Partner, let me upgrade you, upgrade you)

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I can do for you what Martin did for the people
Ran by the men, but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equal
Still played my part and let you take the lead role, believe me
I'll follow, this could be easy
I'll be the help whenever you need me (You need me)
I see your hustle with my hustle, I can keep you
Focused on your focus, I can feed you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
You need a real woman in your life (That's a good look)
Takin' care of home and still fly (That's a good look)
I can help you build up your account
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look)
Believe me (Ladies, that's a good look)
When you're in them big meetings for the mills (That's a good look)
You take me just to complement the deal (That's a good look)
Anything you cop, I'll split the bill
(That's a good look, better yet, a hood look)
Hey, believe me, I can upgrade you (Ladies, that's a good look)

[Chorus: (Beyoncé & JAY-Z)]
Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you (Audemars Piguet you)
Switch your necktie to purple labels (Have you rockin' purple labels)
Upgrade you
(I can) up, (Can I?) up, (Let me) upgrade you (Hey)
(Partner, let me upgrade you, upgrade you)
Partner, let me upgrade you, flip a new page
Introduce you to some new things and
Upgrade you
(Uh, Hov, uh-huh, Hov)
(I can) up, (Can I?) up, (Let me) upgrade you
(Partner, let me upgrade you, upgrade you)
(Uh huh)

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I be's the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz oughta do
It's big ballin', baby, when I'm courtin' you
I'm talkin' spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on your finger's like a tumor
You can't fit your hand in your new purse
It's humorous to me, they watchin' and we just yachtin'
Island-hoppin' off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You sure to see stars, this is high-level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you (He-he-he....)

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevatin' with me
You my project celebrity
I keep your name hot in them streets
But it's that little glimpse of light
That makes a diamond really shine
And you already is a star but, unless you flawless
Then your dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you (Whoo)
Switch your necktie to purple labels
Upgrade you
(I can) up, (Can I?) up, (Let me) upgrade you
(Partner, let me upgrade you, upgrade you)
Partner, let me upgrade you, flip a new page
Introduce you to some new things and
Upgrade you
(I can) up, (Can I?) up, (Let me) upgrade you
(Partner, let me upgrade you, upgrade you)

[Outro: Beyoncé]
Audemars Piguet watch, dimples in your necktie
Hermes briefcase, Cartier tie clips
Silk-lined blazers, diamond-cream facials
VVS cufflinks, six-star pent suites
Partner, let me upgrade you, grade you
Partner, partner, let me upgrade you, grade you
Let me, let me, let me upgrade you, grade you
Partner, partner, partner, let me upgrade you, ha

[Intro: Jamie Foxx]
Yeah ladies I know you're tired of the same old thing
Things have become so mundane
I mean your bedroom is so cold, so cold but I'm here to tell you

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
So girl get comfortable
We 'bout to do something you never done before

Baby 1 plus 1 ain't 2 when you with me
C ain't after A and B when you with me
It don't make sense right now but it will

When it comes to love makin', neither is missionary
Positions: girl pick one...better yet some
Never mind that we tryin' all of 'em!

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
So girl get comfortable
We 'bout to do something you never done before

See what I got over a lot of fellas is that I'm more creative
And soon you will see what I mean, what I mean

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
So girl get comfortable

[Interlude: Ludacris]

Nevertheless, always the more
From the pool table to the kitchen floor
Next stop's the G spot... Luda!
(I like that!)
I like it too, baby

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Let me put a little bit of excite-ment
Up in yo lifestyle
You gotta know that time's of the essence

What you doin' tonight?
Some say that sex is overrated, but they just ain't doin' it right
I keeps it interesting baby just take them clothes off
I'll be your Tylenol just take me till you doze off
Wake you up in the middle of the night and take you to another world
You'll wake up in the mornin' feeling like another girl

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
So girl get comfortable
We 'bout to do something you never done before
Baby, not the usual
Tonight we getting unpredictable
So try to roll with
It, baby (Baby)

[Verse One: Treach]
Hey boo! Yeah did you remember the tip of tender fender bender
From last September you let me enter the center
So we went through the Winter
Then we had a little prob, now we let it solve
Now you think that you get robbed, if you're givin bod
Well I'm stickin to the kitten cause it's hittin
The only way I be splittin if you pick it for money and trick it
You wanna dip, this is the brick you pick
So you ain't dismissed until both sets of lips kiss
It's the mother number one the phunky Phillified
The chilly side, Boyz II Men and women with the illy vibe
So until it's nineteen ninety (nine)
Just vibe with me and smile like you wifey for life, B

[Bridge: Treach, Boyz II Men]

[Treach:] Too high to get over

[Boyz II Men:] Yeah yeah

[Treach:] Too low to get under

[Boyz II Men:] Yeah yeah

[Treach:] Too high to get over

[Boyz II Men:] Yeah yeah

[Puff Daddy:] Gotta get the cash

[Craig Mack:] Ah one two y'all!

[Puff Daddy:] Gotta get, gotta get the dough

[Verse 2: Craig Mack]
Craig Mack's got a lot in store for MC's so please listen
Fake rappers stop booin and hissin
My shit's the bomb, like nitroglycerin
Electrifying, if I said I wasn't I'd be lying
On the fader, from here to Grenada
Dope demonstrater creator of the force like hey Darth Vader
You imitator, I'm greater than your data
MC's run up so then they pack this doggie bag for later
I'm the, wisdom-mystical
Hyper-scientifical
Do your typical write rhymes get loaded take a miracle
To lyrical whip, the word dick on the side tip
Rhymes to flip, Hercules ain't got a tighter grip
Whoever said that you couldn't be beat?  Well have a seat
Grab a spoon, taste some defeat
I shake MC's down directly to the ground
Boyz II Men make the world go round

[Hook]

[Spoken over hook: Busta Rhymes]
How ya feel?
Party people, how ya feel?
Let me know if everything remains real!
Word up!  Tell me how ya feel!
I feel good tonight, talk to me tell me how do ya feel
So that everything's alright
Word is bond!  Busta Rhymes keep it comin one time for your mind
Flip Mode y'all, yo

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
WHOOOO! That music feel my cool breeze
Make you bang your head from hear to overseas, now!
You feel the charge that we be generatin, conversatin
Always get taken by vibes that be penetratin
I make you feel the sensation like we come into
The last days of Revelation, sometimes that's how we be vibin
Yes I'm gonna keep you smilin
Hit you then I take you on a ride just like Coney Island
One two three it's simply you and me
While you listen I MC
Blow your mind and make you really want to par-ty
Ohh ohh! Take those bars and keep em swingin
Ohh!  Sometimes it makes me want to start singin
But I keep on bringing ...
... and swinging you better believe I keep your bells ringing
Feel the motion and the magic potion while we in the dancehall
With Boyz II Men we bring the universal vibe y'all!
Bring the universal vibe y'all
One time, Flip Mode is forever
Y'all get down and feel my thing
Guaranteed to make your fat butt swing
One time while I get on

[Hook]

[Verse Four: Method Man]
Here come that real rap shit
Criminology, yeah
I mentally stab your brain with the pain
While other brothers spit mad game I spit flames
You know my fuckin name, write joints with Mary J
Johnny Blaze get methed right because it pays
Life insurance indeed as we proceed
To give the track menstraul cramps until it bleeds
Who the bad guy?  It's I, the chinky eye
Knotty-head, rugged MC, from N.Y
City, my whole rap committee get busy
My roots date back to Kizzy, now ask who is he?
Lady sings the blues then, I take it as a gem
That's able to raise Boyz II Men
A thousand, young black kids from out the housing
Projects, ready to catch wreck, Ticallion
The center of attraction, guaranteed satisfaction
Stop the yappin make it happen baby
*A brief tone*

(Mystikal)
Miss Michelle Tyler:  Sweet, beautiful
Intelligent, talented, creative, and
Crazy as hell.  And missed more than
Anything in the world

Thank you for being the best sister
A brother could of ever wanted
Twenty-four years.  Laughter and joy
Sure is gon' be hard not being able
To see your smile again, baby
So, I guess, I'll just hold onto
All the memories that we did share
Until we meet again

Anyway, I did it Chell.  We did it
I wish you could of been there
For the finishin' touches
But it's all good
Cause your gonna always
Be in my heart
Oh, thank you for hoopin' on
I'm Not That Nigga for me
You did that, baby.  You
Were already a angel, so
I guess your just goin' home
And, I know that heavenly
Choir sound good up there, now
They one more strong
So, you keep singin' baby
And I'm gonna keep you in my heart
And my thoughts

I love you

[Intro]

[Bridge]
I know y'all niggas ain't fucking with me cause I can't fuck with my damn self, here I go
I know y'all niggas ain't fucking with me cause I can't fuck with my damn self, here I go
Da man right, chea (da man right, chea)
Here I go, here I go

[Verse 1]
Y'all muthafuckers better get ready to rumble
Get in the line like a conga, plastic like plumbing
Cise on the bongo
Y'all muthafuckers ain't ready
Hey to them boys, get at them bitches and cut they ass
As sharp as a machete
Dope I don't; herbs I do
You bitches probably couldn't see me with a birds eye view
It's alive, finna make your head spin
Stop walking the one way to a fucking dead end
Bitch you yellow
Coward hearted, better bring some water
Kick the gasoline can over
Get this fucking fire started
Your heart jump like a bass drum bump
You bad enough to meet the alligator in the swamp

[Hook]
Here I go, here I go, here I go, here I go , here I go
Here I go, here I go, here I go, here I go , here I go
Here I go, here I go, here I go
The man rightchea

[Bridge 2]
I know y'all niggas ain't fucking with me cause I can't fuck with my damn self
What you muthafuckers know bout rapping (what you muthafuckers know bout rapping)
Who put you on the map (who put you on the fucking map)
I know y'all niggas ain't fucking with me cause I can't fuck with my damn self
Here I go - the man right, chea
Here I go, here I go

[Verse 2]
Rhyme slaying, straight suckers I'm slaying
Hoes I'm laying, niggas gon' barely stand
I got 'em laying and praying, delaying, decaying
Ask them hoes, I ain't playing with 'em
Wanna get beef, you'll have to turn your cheek
Cock back like like Mad Max and knock out one of them fucking teeth
I'm a mean, gene machine
The executioner be appeased with guillotine
My lifestyle is brutal, like a pit on a poodle
After disaster, have you sipping on chicken noodle
Get yo ass in gear, I’m getting fucked by your women
I'm the shark in the dark, bitch at night don't go swimming
Cause if you do you doomed
I'll probably be the king of the looney toons
Sweating and gasping, I'm a massive assassin
All this smashing and smashing, kicking ass with a passion
Mystikal's on a roll, just that throwed
(Ice cold)
Another nigga couldn't touch me with a flagpole
Wanna fight Iron Mike but you're too damn light
Like a knife I'll rip ya from ya ass to your appetite
Gangsta since Genesis
Fuck a (?) I'm the foreign minister, don't brag fag
Wanna battle, bring a body bag
I'm gonna need it, to carry your stupid ass
I observe, time to serve rhymes I heard like words of King George the 3rd
I proceed, to mislead the sweet hoes I cheated
Devour cause I'm sour like Johnny Appleseed
I intrude hoes call me rude, bitch I'm smooth
Watch your fucking attitude
Blast from the past, curse like I'm Mac
I'm like a black cat on the trail of a fat rat
You finna overdose
And choke off these rhymes I wrote
Somebody said that you was looking for me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm coming straight for your throat, like a coyote on a goat
Note by note, you sweat me like a ho be no, you ho
Cannot find a antidote cause when I start to flow
Murder he wrote
Huff puff and bluff, come, touch this rough stuff
And get cuffed, snuffed, buffed and scuffed
You can't hit this, get with this or witness
I'm bad tempered, I'll fuck you up with the quickness
I paid my dues, I'm bad news to fools, I choose you lose
Fuck the rules, I wreck beaucoup crews with the words I use
Got me feeling like Z.Z. Hill cause I'm screaming and screaming
And singing the blues you been child-abused
I never bled in the battle, I refuse to lose
You can bring your whole posse bitch I still won't lose
I'll stomp your whole staff, you must want a bloodbath
Fucking riff-raff, break you in half and laugh
Then snap and served you I (?) and heard you
Think about them words you heard, you fucking nerd
You tried to probably rob me, dodge me
Fucking, fighting, making money on my hobby
Freezing degrees run 'em up, shut 'em up, buttered 'em up
What up? Wanna fight? Bitch, put 'em up
How that sound come get knocked down
Bolos, I throw bitch you won't last no round
I bet let's see, what we can fuck with next
Step that ass in the ring and I'ma jab you to death
Cause I am the baddest black Prince of the South
He who run up, gon' get knocked the fuck out
Pound for pound, blow for blow we could go
If you're really looking for an ass whooping
Here I go, here I go, here I go
The man right chea
I'M! (x8)

[Verse 1]
See I'm that nigga that's, fixin' to do my dirt under the sun
I been hustlin' since the morning become
I keep a couple of rocks under my tongue
Watch out here come the cop, might notta stand still where you chill
Run to no automobile cause it can kill
My destination can feed my home purpose
I'm vibrating' on the down low in the first place
You want me show me the money you gonna be payin'
Pop ya ass up out of the van and take these rocks up out my hand
Cause I don't trust ya and I ain't tryin'
Hold up nigga, I don't know ya gotta reach out at the same time
You want some, come get some
Tyson's on the drum and I'MMMMM!

I'M! (x16)

[Verse 2]
Ya livin', in livin' up in my people's rentin'
Windows tinted, nigga from a couple houses down
Get Skinny, bump it to last amount of spittin'
It's senseless how them dudes be smokin' that shit
Gettin' roped in that shit, jump in this shit
I got to flippin' on nigga, you want some more of that shit
Live in that click where niggas do what they gotta do
Blast em' with burnable fuck em' and watch em' fuck you
Nigga be livin' that life, playin the role of a gangsta
But them niggas ain't gangstas
Bitch you gotta be big enough to think about bein' a fuckin gangsta
Most of them niggas be comin' real
Bring it to ya blood field but that nigga got killed
That's how it be's on that rough side
The tough die, the strong die
Fuck with the wrong niggas on with the wrong chrome
Check the wrong shit, walk the wrong zone
Nigga you good as dead and gone (Problem serious)
Nigga don't hear me that's how we livin' till the saga stops
Every nigga and his mom gotta Glock on my block
Niggas push rocks and dodge cops till they pissed and tired
Nigga, you livin' by the gun
Y'all need to handle y'all fuckin' business cause I'M!
I'M! (x8)

[Verse 3]
Don't sell it, Arm & Hammer got my rocks swellin'
Laws is yellin, prosecutors yellin'
I'mma Glock ya spot, ya head pop like a fuckin' melon
Do my thing destiny I'm a felon
But I ain't just a young, black nigga rebellin'
Breath by breath, step by step, day by day
Playin' this game of death
My nigga remind ya of manslaughter
Niggas slangin' quarters
Georgia, Cali, to New Orleans rollin'
I'm in the pen, pumpin' that iron until I'm swole up
Grits and cheese made me bigger
Now I'm just a lil' bit harder than that next nigga
The first one up to run up
That nigga there gon' get done up
When I put that fuckin' gun up
They told ya, ya hip bone gone gone
That lil' roam don't live long, pop me to stop it
Cock block me, you bitches can't drop me
Hoes gon' still jock me
Got me now the niggas mock me
I seen Scarface twice now I'm a fuckin' carbon copy
Missing on society
And insane probably cause I'm full of animosity
I'm kind of like at all
I might huff and puff and blow ya fuckin' hat off
Tear it off, swear it off
Now get the 411 to 911 to Red Cross
My moaning make me lead
Ten steps to feel these
Got me cocked these
Swingin' like Conan
Wanted from no man with boo-koo ho fans
Talk more garbage, funk, filth, shit, trash, and lies
Rhymes so funky they draw flies
If I rock one up, shock one up
It simple enough to be did
But your shit terror rig
Change your big
Niggas be sayin big
Pass the fig, don't give me no fuckin' pig
I don't choose no swine
But eat Popeye's chicken and eat watermelon to the fuckin' rind
Feel the grip of this black chrome
That don't fuckin' rhyme, nigga get ya back broke
Fuckin' with them black folks
I'm (x5) with DJ scratching in background
Artist: Boyz II Men w/ Erick Sermon, Keith Murray, Redman, Two To Da Head
Album: Vibin 12"
Song: Vibin (Kenny Smoove Remix)

Verse One: Erick Sermon

It's Kenny, and Erick Sermonn
Give me room I'm the mack-tastic, theatrical
Dramatical, bringing pain plus working chains
Hey, it's Erick Sermon with the umm my sound is high bias
Not on Def Squad I wouldn't try this
Check the mixes my style is wicked like three 6's
Harmony stacked vocals on Boyz II Men spinnin
Like the wheels, on my black 500 S
TV's in the headrest, who flex the best?
No question, I'm the nuh, believe what you heard
I shut down dig and vibe in boy that's my word
My style, is all the way live
And Billy Dee love it like it's Colt .45, vibe

Verse Two: Keith Murray
Now you can On a Bended Knee to the End of the Road
Luxurious glorious punks vibe all in your soul
And I ain't even gotta talk about how I'm livin
With E.D. and Boyz II Men, turnin little girls to women
From the mental to the physical, I get in you
Let's keep it real and bring your homegirls for the Def Squad crew
I been all around the world, what battle me?
Take this autograph home and give it to your family
It's a shame the way I trap rappers up in my brain
And drive em all Batty, like Bruce Wayne
I be spackling and tackling
MC's to the mat like world wrestling, just vibing

Chorus: Boyz II Men

Every-thing's fine
It ain't nothing to it, cause we're gonna do it all
But all we do is
We're just, vibin, you know it
Dancin the night away
We're just, vibin
Nonstop until the break of day

Verse Three: Redman

Jumpin jehosa, I roast a, toughest MC
You're coming closer, to getting blown, effin with these
I freak the funk styles major, my neighbors complain
About the vapors and the capers, and murder your brain
The hot rocker, the shocker of the, 40's and vodka
The Phantom of the Opera give you, one beat to rock ta
Plus my poppa, threw me out when I was young
Now I'm a Boy II Man run with the with the Boyz and plan
With a, new toy in hand, mics I get freaky like a
Dean it don't matter what the size of the arena
Kenny Smoove, drop it on the one while I bust
Any MC that think they running with us
Chorus

Verse Four: Two To Da Head

Bust it, it be the Boyz II the Men, with the Two To Da Head
Coming through with Ed sticking victims through their necks
To be down On Bended Knee, and caught up in the vibe
Honey I get you wet until your Water Runs Dry
And once I hear the bum-baada, umm-dada
Original problem child, I betta holla
For some mo', while I headline the freak show
And get you vibin from here, to the End of the Road
You bust a U-turn cause it's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday
It's more rotten baby
Droppin Sermons like Erick for all the lost souls that perished
Big up to Most Beautifullest and the Funkadelic

[Intro: Madonna]
Waiting for you, just waiting
What you waiting for?
Waiting for you, just waiting
What you waiting for?
Waiting for you, just waiting
What you waiting for?
Waiting for you, just waiting
What you waiting for?

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Well I know from experience
That if you have to ask for something more than once or twice
It wasn't yours in the first place
And that's hard to accept when you love someone
And you're led to believe that in their moment of need
That they want what you want, but they don't

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry, you're gonna say goodbye
Baby tell me why
Tell me why or you're gonna have to justify

[Chorus: Madonna]
This waiting for you, just waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you, just waiting
What you waiting for?

[Verse 2: Madonna]
It was so easy in the beginning
When you didn't feel like running from your feelings
Like you are now, what happened, what do I remind you of?
Your past, your dreams, or some part of yourself that you just can't love
I wish I could believe you
Or at least have the courage to leave you

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Life has taught me that love, with a man like you
Is only gonna make me blue
But I love you anyway no matter what you do
You don't come around here, like you did before
When you did adore
Tell me what I did to deserve this

[Verse 3: Everlast]
What you waitin' for, hun, come and get it
Don't even sweat it baby doll that can wet it
I treat it like a virgin and work it over time
If honey's lookin' fine we can go the whole night
We can do the deuce sweety pie, what's the news
I bet ya when I'm done, hun, I know I'm true blue
Cause I can get explicit, baby let me kiss it
Get it while it's hot cause when I'm gone you're gonna miss it
Sexual healin' baby that's what I'm dealin'
Mirrors on the ceilin', come check the feelin'
High pitch squealin', twitch it, jerk it
I'm a stud like Captain Kirk and it's your body that I'm workin'
Cause I can get freaky like a Friday
I know you're going my way, naked on the highway
Jump into the ride, I'll take you to the pent
The name's Everlast, hun, here's what it is

[Chorus: Madonna]
Waiting for you, just waiting
I'm waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

[Bridge: Madonna]
Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me who is going to take my place

[Outro: Madonna]
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting
And the next time you want pussy, ha, just look in the mirror, baby
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you, just waiting

[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Ho!

[Verse 1: Robin Thicke]
She's the kind of girl you wanna marry
The kind of girl you'd walk the whole Earth for
Put her on your back and just carry
Her attitude is hotter than the earth's core
When she's around, nothing else matters
Untouchable, she's got her own forcefield
Sooner or later, someone will get at her
If I don't, someone else will

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you

[Post-Hook: Robin Thicke]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
Uhh, she's the kind of girl you wanna marry
Scientists say that she's the second sunshine
And now my life is sweeter than berries (Than berries)
I guess if we have sex, our love will turn to wine
When she's around, nothing else matters
Even if the sky was at a stand still
If I turn my back then someone will get at her
If I don't, someone else will

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you

[Post-Hook: Robin Thicke]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I'm so glad)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I found you)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (Oh girl!)
Wanna love you girl, ooh
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I'm so glad)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I found you)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (Oh girl!)
Wanna love you girl, ooh

[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]
Uhh, picture this all
Picture my life and my intention to ball
Picture this ice and how it glitter for y'all
Now don't you feel claustrophobic when that chick is involved?
She changed your life, and your frame of mind
Sorry, I hope what I'm saying is fine
We fuss but we take it one day at a time
If there's a fire, you know that she'll lay in the line
I just, close my eyes and curve my mouth
Open my mind and words come out
You're eclectic, you're creative
You the picture girl I just painted
I got it, you name it, it's all paid for
Big castle on the seashore
With the Willy Wonka decor
How this sound? Mr. and Mrs. Skateboard P!

[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I'm so glad)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I found you)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (Oh girl!)
Wanna love you girl, ooh
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I'm so glad)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I found you)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (Oh girl!)
Wanna love you girl, ooh
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I'm so glad)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I found you)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (Oh girl!)
Wanna love you girl, ooh
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I'm so glad)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I found you)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (Oh girl!)
Wanna love you girl, ooh

[Verse 1: Usher]

Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend!
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems!         (That's right!)
You used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do!
And when I go home at night
And lay my head down
All I seem to think about was you
And how...

[Chorus: Usher]

... you make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you,               (Ooh, yeah! Ooh, yeah!)

On,...)
That come along with,                            (... come on, come on!)
You make me...
You make me...

[Verse 2: Usher]

Now what's bad
Is you're the one that hooked us up!
Knowing it should've been you!
What's sad is that I love her
But I'm falling for you!
What should I do?
Should I...
... tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I...
... do exactly what I feel inside?
Cause I...
... I don't wanna go
Don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together!

[Chorus: Usher]

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with,        (UUH!)
Start a new relationship with you,               (Ooh Baby!)
This is what you do!                             (See what you do?)

[Intro: R. Kelly]
Uh huh, hey, I remember when I back in the days
When I ain't have shit
Now that I got shit
Niggas wanna keep up shit, hah
But it's all good (make this loot)
Watch me do this shit

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Ayo, from my town to Chi-town
R. Kelly got some thugs to make you lock down
Voice cry, hot sounds, tied down, cop twisters
Shop lifters with Benini schemes
Smoke greenie green, Candyman up in Cabrini Green
Some cats I know like to splurge on they wrist
But my man karate man cut the nerves out his fist
But yo, throw your hands up y'all it's just love in here
It ain't shit but a thug affair
I'm at the bar spending thug money (money)
Cop so much huh, they say I love money, karats like Bugs Bunny
So lets slide you got the right thong
'ju don't know, I'm all night long
The DJ playing all the right songs
To the BM, rims are muy bien
It's R. Kelly, Killa Cam, baby girl, can you dig now?
Next time we see him yo, we laying Mr. Biggs down

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
To all my players and my thugs
To all my honies in the club
To all the hoods that show me love
We ride, we ride
(From Chi-town to LA)
To all my ballers locking ice, getting a room for the night
Taking first class flights, we ride, we ride
(From Chi-town to NY)

[Verse 2: Noreaga]
Yo, I used to be in Chi-town and collect panties
When I make Cabrini Green you know I hit Sammy's
Thugged out yo, all my people giving eye jammies
Now them shorties say I'm cute, when they can't stand me
R. Kelly yo, I'm right from the belly, you know the soul
Everything that we spit on is platinum gold
But now it's for the love, for all the players and the thugs
Yo, it's a party going on, meet me right at the club
We got some chickens in the living room getting it on
And they ain't leaving 'til six in the morning
Thugged out, my people gettin' head while we yawning
Tear the club up every time we performing
Gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place
Because this shorty right here, looking good in my face
Ayo, it's so deep I told shorty just last week
Uh huh, it's like, you remind me of my Jeep

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
To all my players and my thugs
To all my honies in the club
To all the hoods that show me love
We ride, we ride
(From Chi-town to LA)
To all my ballers locking ice, getting a room for the night
Taking first class flights, we ride, we ride
(From Chi-town to NY)

[Verse 3: Vegas Cats]
Only ballers be allowed up in here
Money makers got my thug niggas watching my rear for player haters
Eighteen and I'm living a dream, go figure
How a nigga that's younger than you, ice bigger
Don't sweat that, stick to rap nigga, try that
Call my nigga R. Kel if you need a hit, black
And when you get it, make it known baby, who did it
It'll make your fans hit the stores and go get it
Now, here come a bitter sweet note for the fellas
Left out the club with her friend, now she jealous
Mad 'cause she can't ride in the LS
Yeah, she kinda mad but a baller could care less
While you sleep, sleep, sleep
I'm in a Benz going beep, beep, beep
Got your girl saying "Yo, who he?"
So let's ride to Rockland's party, uh huh

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
Check, ghetto pro'
Federal, Jay-Z shake the dice, let 'em go
Bet a load I tear down every show
Better know cheddar grow like the 'fro on ba'y bro
Says R., Jay y'all, all I need is four bars
I'm hotter than a lotta men
Switch up cars like Rodman's hair color, then hit your broad
I'm borderline too much for the mortal mind
Every time you ought to rewind, find there's more to find
Now pop that cork, then pour the wine
Represent New York to Chi-town, like what
Floss mine, like of course my, what
Never cross my family, can we all get along? Hell no
I'm trying to tell y'all who dat is that rule that biz
Not your baby daddy but Jay-Z, true that is
Better school that kid on who's shoes that is
Or who I be, nigga, V.I.P Jigga, uh huh

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
To all my players and my thugs
To all my honies in the club
To all the hoods that show me love
We ride, we ride
(From Chi-town to LA)
To all my ballers locking ice, getting a room for the night
Taking first class flights, we ride, we ride
(From Chi-town to NY)

[Outro: R. Kelly]
Let's get together and make this loot
(Trackmasters, Rockland)
Make this loot
(Untertainment)
Come on players
(Thugged Out)
Come on players
(And we out like that)
Roc-A-Fella y'all

[Intro]
To all the youth in the world
That think that nobody understands
Well, I understand that

[Chorus]
It's been hard for me
Trying, struggling endlessly
For where I've been is no longer where I'm at
And where I'm going is not where I'm stopping at
It's been hard for me
Trying, struggling endlessly
For where I've been is no longer where I'm at
And where I'm going is not where I'm stopping at

[Verse 1]
I grew up as a seventies baby
Brought up in poverty and sin
Making jokes at the crazy lady
Never cared how she was feeling within
I knew all the words to Michael Jackson's album as a kid
And when it came to the biggest pressure
No, he wasn't my man
At the age of seven years old
A strange thing happened to me
Before I even saw my life had flashed before me
And I've got the marks to show
And it became a thing of beauty
So I gotta let you know that my life and my life

[Chorus]
It's been hard for me (It's been)
Trying, struggling endlessly
For where I've been, that's no longer where I'm at
And where I'm going, that's not where I'm stopping at
It's been hard for me
Trying, struggling endlessly
For where I've been, that's no longer where I'm at
And where I'm going, that's not where I'm stopping at

[Verse 2]
Now mama's working hard all day
And she said this before she left home
"Take care of your little brother
Have the place clean when I get home"
All this priority, me and Tonya had to learn to be grown
But at the time for me it's like grown had seemed so long
Woke up and I'm seventeen
With nothing going for me
Except the fact that I sing
You know it hurts so much
From all the sights that I've seen
From abusing to holding drugs
You probably couldn't take some of the things
That I lived in my life

[Chorus]
It's been hard for me (It's been hard)
Trying, struggling endlessly (I know, I know)
For where I've been, that's no longer where I'm at (I know, I know)
And where I'm going, that's not where I'm stopping at (I understand)
It's been hard for me (I'm wit' you)
Trying, struggling endlessly (I been there)
For where I've been, that's no longer where I'm at
And where I'm going, that's not where I'm stopping at

[Bridge]
It's hard and the street's a jungle
I'm telling you, I'm telling you
Especially with your pretty colors
I'm telling you, I'm telling you
So stay low and keep it humble
I'm telling you, I'm telling you
Black women, hold it down, keep your feet on the ground
Black men, keep searchin' and you'll be found

[Chorus]
It's been hard for me
Trying, struggling endlessly
For where I've been, that's no longer where I'm at
And where I'm going, that's not where I'm stopping at

[Verse 3: Eve]
In this world of continuous bullshit and full clips
Seems all we have to pass on is being useless (Huh)
Broken homes, babies all alone
Parents never there, no food, no clothes to wear
Anger everywhere
Ain't no values being taught, no productive thoughts (Uh-uh)
Jealousy rules the world, take shit at any cost
Gotta change our state of life, make it worth living
God gave me voices to speak, and that's our way of giving
It's so much bigger than the furs and jewels (Come on)
What about encouraging the youth to do well? (Huh)
What about giving back?
What about unifying shit? We all black, get it together
Everybody's got their trials and tribulations (Yeah)
Learn to change the negative to positive situations (Always)
Don't hold the lessons that you've learned (Huh)
Pass it on and accept the blessings that you earn (Come on)

[Chorus]
It's been hard for me
Trying, struggling endlessly
For where I've been, that's no longer where I'm at
And where I'm going, that's not where I'm stopping at
It's been hard for me
Trying, struggling endlessly
For where I've been, that's no longer where I'm at
And where I'm going, that's not where I'm stopping at
It's been hard for me
Trying, struggling endlessly
For where I've been, that's no longer where I'm at
And where I'm going, that's not where I'm stopping at
It's been hard for me
Trying, struggling endlessly

[R. Kelly]
Sitting at the bar with mama
Shorty tryna bring the drama
But she cannot fade the player
Cause this pimp is a money maker
Mettings from Chi-town to L.A
Yo I came to get down at this party
I got my eyes on Keisha and Shante'
Rollin' in like this track was reggae
I roll throught the hottest clubs
With about a houndred thugs
Get up out of thousands hugs
From chicks that wanna sit on dubs

[Chorus]
Yo who's that in the jeep?
(Some honeys)
Who's that up off in that truck?
(My niggas)
Yo what y'all doin' tonight?
(We thuggin')
Yo whats off up in that cup
(Some liquor)
Yo, I'm rollin' wit y'all
(Well lets go)
Shawty where's the alcohol?
(Right here)
Now let me hit that haze
(Fa shizzle)
That would really make my day

[R. Kelly]
Yea, take a plugger for the pool party
Right off up in Miami
Ten G's for the best bikini
Lookin' for the biggest booty
She got the crowd goin' crazy
Cause this track here is so amazing
Yo even with a nigga's life lookin' hazy
Still you R&B cats can't fade me

[Chorus]

[Bridge - R. Kelly]
I'm driving a fast car, jump to the third lane
Mommy a passenger, stealing the champagne
We stop at a red light, she driving me insane
Like, we seened it like a ---------
Stop playing girl the way you shake your phatty back
So sexy the way you tellin' daddy that
Turn that piece around and let me patty that
Got me saying, "Man, I'm tryna marry that"

[Fat Joe]
Oh no, They did it again! (Who?)
Rob and Joe they slept with ten (What?)
Dyme misses, fine misses, big behind misses
All kinds of misses, don't matter, you're my misses
What's love got to do with -----?
And, everyday a new different group of chicks
We headed to the Island of Caymen's
Life of the famous, shorties almost died when we came in
Girl, I know you diggin the diddy bop
This my world come through in the whole city stop
Looks like ice but actually its really not
Diamonds, blindin', all live around me
Five houndred thou and all on the time piece
In the South Bronx you can find me
Nevermind me, thats just how we ball
I'm rollin with y'all now tell me "Where's the alcohol?"

[Chorus]

[Fat Joe]
Come on, make 'em bounce baby
Uh, yeah, uh, keep goin' baby
That chunky, funky, sticky, ooh wheee
Uh, The R, Joe Crack the Don

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]

Have you ever been to Spain in the slow lane
Holdin your name, play 'n' bet it like no pain, no gain
Let me show you wot your body is made for
Everything is on me it's all paid for
Bubble up, get in trouble up, and raise your level up (come on, come on)
Put your heart in, I beg your pardon

All your blowing trees are on there wind
Why you act like I can't be the only one for you, yeah

You put that ass on me and made me stay
Girl I'm feeling so deceived
You got me feeling so confused, oooh

(Girl I got to get...)

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Lay up and spend cheese, Malibu breeze
Pop bottles on the regular

Good bye the lime light, head down south
And get ya mind right
Sex so good you can't believe it
Later on we can have some kids, that's what it is, Whoa

[Verse 3: Jamie Foxx]
I'm not a player but I'm still a man
There's just some things you gotta understand
Girl you know I ride for you
But sometimes you just put me through
Sooo much, when I wanna get with you
(Girl I got to get...)
And I know that if you get your way (if you get your way)
You'll have me fiendin' for ya every day
Your smile, your kiss, your love, that exists for me, oooh
When I wanna get with you

Lay up and spend cheese, Malibu breeze
Pop bottles on the regular

Sex so good you can't believe it
Later on we can have some kids, that's what it is, Whoa

[Verse 4: The Game]
Next to you, your lexus coupe
My four door bentley, that Dre just sent me
Millionaire boys club, and my wrist freeze
Me and jacob got an understandin', I don't spend cheese
And I don't see no rock on ya hand
So my question to you is, where's ya man?
She said he been doing movies lately
And Game you got a baby face
Then she split like Tracy
I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em
Let 'em runaway, Watch 'em come back like Ma$e and
She an ATL freak, she get A town stomped
But she never been fucked on the beach
In silk Channel sheets, and it feel good baby
She looked back at me and said "you so craaazy"
After that she played me
I asked her whose pussy is this? And she screamed out "Jamie's"

[Bridge: Jamie Foxx]
And now that I have put it all out on the line
Close the deal and wave the hands of time
Your king, my queen, a wedding ring, for you
Girl I wanna be with you
(Girl I got to get...)

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx (Snoop Dogg)]
Any time any place - can I be with you
Don't ya know, there's some things - I, just wanna be with you
Girl I'm still your man, Girl I'm still your man
(sex so good you can't believe it
Later on we can have some kids, that's what it is, Whoa)
Can I be with you?

[Hook + Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Lay up and spend cheese, Malibu breeze
Pop bottles on the regular

And try to get next to ya
Good bye the lime light, head down south
And get ya mind right
Sex so good you can't believe it
Later on we can have some kids, that's what it is, Whoa

[Outro: Jamie Foxx (Snoop Dogg)]

[Intro: Raekwon (Ghostface Killah)]
Yo word up, yo Ghost come here
Ooh, you in trouble
Yo Ghost man, you haven't found out
(What, what happened?)
I know she is frontin' (for real son)
Nah, nah man come on
She is on the block son (damn)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
She said you couldn't deny it
Why did you try to hide it?
You buggin, it's just like you
Tell me what am I suppose to do?
Should have told me long time ago
Baby I would not have walked out the door
You tried to deny your own flesh and blood

[Mary J. Blige]
I couldn't believe my ears when she told me
You had a child and she was the girl
I thought I meant more to you
Shared thoughts with you, held hands with you
You loved only you, not me and not your child
Tell me why, is not worth your while

[Chorus]

[Mary J. Blige]
So many things you need to do
Like take care of your responsibilities
Stand tall and be a man, strong and understand
That the truth will set you free
No need for you to lie, to hurt on me
She said it and I believe it

[Chorus]

[Mary J. Blige]
What can I do, said it - I won't play with you
*singing various lines over each other*
You tried to deny your own flesh and blood

[Ghostface Killah]
It was the one night stand and the chick tracked me off
I was drunk and the stink-witch slit the condom off
We got seven years in, now boo now picture me
This Hollywood big-head bitch don't mean shit to me
Your eyes look sad and you are hurt boo, pardon
Self, put the drink down, Scotch is bad for your health
Why you slapped me in my sleep, with steamin
Hot grits in the bowl, fiendin to throw it at me
Chill! (Don't try to deny your own flesh and blood)

[Chorus 2X]

[Raekwon]
Read the fish, get the red lobster, tilt your glass, seen shorty ass
That's what's happenin', son, pass the hot sauce
Straight vibes, corner to corner, me and my mans glanced at her
The look, sure do prove she a woman
Yo, good morning, mamma, what you ordering, right now, some water
And it hit me, mami was a dime and a quarter
Thirty five cent, thirty five dollars or thirty five bricks
That's live, then I seen her eye and blew a kiss

[Alicia Keys]
Baby, baby, baby, from the day I saw you
I really, really wanted to catch your eye
There's something special 'bout you

[Verse 1]
Yo, tell me fellas have you seen her? (Seen her)
It was about five minutes ago
When I seen the hottest chick that a youngin' ever seen before
I say, "Yo, tell the girls I wanna meet her" (Meet her)
On second thought that ain't the way to go
I gotta give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it, there she is I gotta stop her
Oh, should I talk about her smile? (It's been said before)
Or what about her style? (Too obvious)
I'm out of time, she's out the door
I gotta go for mine, I think I'll say

[Chorus]
Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss (Oh yeah)
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby

[Verse 2]
Now shawty, grab hold of my hand
And let's pretend the floor is ours
You say you don't really dance
(Don't worry 'bout it, we just one-two step, one-two step)
Now if the music is moving too fast (Too fast)
Grab my hand a little tighter (Tighter)
Don't be afraid to move a little closer
Girl, there's something about you that makes me wanna say (Aw yeah, aw yeah)

[Chorus]
Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss (Ooh)
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss (Ooh)
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby
I think I'll say yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby

[Bridge]
I wanna be where you are
Ain't nothing wrong with dancing
Baby, it's so romantic
Baby, I can be in your heart
So many things I wanna tell you
I think that I should start by saying

[Chorus]
Yo, woah
I don't know your name but excuse me miss (Oh yeah)
I saw you from across the room
I gotta give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it, there she is I gotta stop her (Oh yeah)
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss (Oh)
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby

[Outro]
Now everybody just clap your hands like this (Like this)
Just clap your hands like this (Woah, like this, huh)
And if your shorty's in the house tonight
Just grab her by the hand, homie, make her understand
Y'all was made to dance like this (Like this)
Y'all was made to bounce like this (Woah, like this)
Just let her know she was made for you and
You want to do everything she want to, man
Ha, woo!

[Introduction: Usher, Freeway, Lil Jon and Ludacris]
Peace up, A Town down, Philly, yeah, yeah, okay, okay
Usher, Usher, wait, Lil Jon, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Freeway]
Luda, Usher, Lil Jon and Free
When its time, only niggers' rock designer first
And we pull up and we crush the curb
And the rims so deep, you can't find your feet
Can't see past the truck, past the Phantom, the click
I catch Hummer, Benz, and Bentley's
Wrist froze, step on the grease, crush the guard
And, with Jay-Z twisting up weed, the Big Bad Wolf
He'll puff your hut down, the gauge, I'll buck rounds
Leave you with no knees, the O.G., probably bouncing to rap music
The four life fluid and it does make the chicks' scream

[Bridge: Ludacris, Usher and Lil Jon]
Take that and rewind it back
Lil Jon's got the beat that make's your booty go smack
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go

[Verse 2: Usher and Lil Jon]
I was up in the club with my homies'
Trying to get a little V I
Keep it down on the low key, low key
You should know how it feels, hey, hey
I saw the shorty, she was checking up on me
From the game, she was spitting in my ear
You would think that she know me, know me
I decided to chill, okay, conversation got heavy
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow, watch out
Oh, watch out, she's saying, 'Come get me', 'Come get me'
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, 'Baby, let's go', when I told her, 'Let's go', I said

[Hook: Usher and Lil Jon]
Yeah, yeah, shorty got down on her knees, said 'Come and get me'
Yeah, yeah, I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
Yeah, yeah, her and my girl used to be the best of homies'
Yeah, yeah, next thing I knew, she was all up on me screaming

[Hook: Usher] + (Lil' Jon in backround)
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah - yeah!
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah - yeah!

[Verse 3: Usher] + (*Lil' Jon*)
She's all up in my head now
Got me thinking that it might
Be a good time to take her with me (with me)
Cause she's ready to leave (ready to leave - now!) (*let's let's go!*)
Now I got to keep it real now
Cause on a 1 to 10 she's a certified 20
But that just ain't me (*hey!*)
Cause I don't know, if I take that chance
Just where's it going to lead?
But what I do know, is the way she dance
Make shorty alright with me
The way she "get low!"
I'm like yeah, just work that out for me
She ask for one more dance and I'm like yeah
How the hell am I supposed to leave?
(*Let's go bring the beat back!*) and I said..

[Hook: Usher] + (Lil' Jon)

[Hook: Usher] + (Lil' Jon in backround)

[Verse 4: Ludacris] + (*Lil' Jon*)
Watch out, my outfit's rediculous
In the club looking so conspicuous
And RAWR, these women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'm a milk the cow (*yeah!*)
And forget about game, I'm a spit the truth (*what?!*)
I won't stop until I get them in they birthday suits (*yeah, yeah!*)
So give me the rhythm and it'll be of with they clothes
Then bend over to the FRONT - and touch your toes!
I - left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting then I put them on foot patrol (*let's go!*) (ow!)
How you like me now?
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thou-sand!
Let's drink, you the one to please (*yeah*)
Ludacris fill cups like double D's (*yeah!*)
Me and Ush once more and we leaves them dead
We want a lady in the streets but a freak in the bed - that say..

[Hook: Usher] + (Lil' Jon in backround)

[Hook: Usher] + (Lil' Jon in backround)

[Outro: Ludacris]
Take that and rewind it back
Lil' Jon got the beat that make your booty go (smack)
Take that, rewind it back
Usher's got the voice that make your booty go (smack)
Take that, rewind it back
Ludacris got the flow that make your booty go (smack)
Take that, rewind it back
Lil' Jon got the beat that make your booty go (smack)

[Intro: Lauryn Hill]
Hey love, hey love
Turn yourself ’round
(Turn yourself ’round)
’Cause I got that brown
You're in love

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
They call me L-Mahogany ’cause of the things that I do
Like disappearing for a week with my crew
Like making sure that all my peoples got loot
Like watching out for Babylon in the blue
They be like why do she rock so fly
On the microphone its do or die
Brothers be like oh my
You don't know what you're missing
Its Fugees and Mary

[Mary]
I can't deal with the fact
That you don't want me around
Why you wanna see me down
It's so unusual
That you don't love me no more
Why you wanna close the door
I spend all my days
And all my nights with you
Just tell me what am I gonna do
Without you
If loving you is so right
Tell me how I make it through the night
You know that I don't ever wanna leave you

[Mary]
(I wanna be with you)
I just wanna be with you
Nothing else I'd rather do
(I wanna be with you)
I want to spend my life with you, oh

[Mary]
Let's take this time to think about
What was said and done
Now tell me why you had to run away from me
Now I can't sleep at night
Why we have to fight
Every day from you
I look and I see something new
Now tell me what I got to do, uh
To get this through to you
It's the little things you do for me
That make me very happy
You know that I don't wanna leave you

[Lauryn]
I love you I keep
Put your number in parenthesis
So I can know your borough
You mind if I say hello
We can make it healthy, you know
A strong ghetto love
Cause you met me at the club
Grinding to some reggae dub
That ain't where I wanna be
I need a family
(That's what I need, know what I'm saying, word)
Chastity I'll be if you're looking for a refugee
See my love anoints all your joints in the erogenous points
I make ya tipsy, read you your fortune like a gypsy (Ha)
So lift me to this plateau and don't forget the chateau
Cause you without me just ain't natural

[Mary]
You don't want me there
And it's beginning to make me so scared
(I wanna be with you)
So scared that I might lose you
All I wanna do is be with you baby
Baby, baby, baby
(I wanna be with you)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I wanna be with you)
I just wanna pick up the phone
I know if you do, do ooh yeah
(I wanna be with you)
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I wanna be with you)
Oh I wanna be with you

[Intro: R. Kelly]
No matter what ya'll say or do

First of the month and rent is due
We gotta get this paper
Come for us, we'll wait for you
A million men can't take us

[Chorus: Tone]
Did you ever think that you would be this rich
Did you ever think that you would have these hits
Did you ever think that you would be the don
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn
Did you ever think that you would be this paid
Were there times when your ass was real afraid
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours
Have a show with fifty million viewers

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
I used to think about how I was gonna make it
Struggling day to day just trying to get this paper
Hoping the day would come when things would go my way
But now I'm living lavish and all I do is hear them say

[Chorus: Tone]
Did you ever think that you would be this rich
Did you ever think that you would have these hits
Did you ever think that you would be the don

Did you ever think that you would sell out tours
Have a show with fifty million viewers

[Verse 2: Nas]
Hey yo
Now who knows poverty like Robert and me
Did you ever think you'd be dancin' and vibin' with me
Did you ever think you'd push a Ferrari, blast a Nas CD
With 5 TV's and DVD's, come on ride with me
Ain't naan nigga fly like me
Honey you heard about the style I got
We from the wildest blocks, where police
Make arrests, carry heat wear vests, we ghetto
Never thought we'd ever reach this level
My people behind metal
The streets coulda had us, but now we live lavish
Our freaks be the baddest
Bus 'em out while maids change the sheets on the mattress
It's deep cuz I never thought I'd reach this status
Walk around and grown women stop and look
They recognize me, no longer hide they pocketbooks
Hate me now cuz I ain't gonna stop, you're stuck
The remix is R. Kelly, please drop the hook
Come on

[Chorus: Tone]
Did you ever think that you would be this rich
Did you ever think that you would have these hits
Did you ever think that you would be the don
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn
Did you ever think that you would be this paid
Were there times when your ass was real afraid
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours
Have a show with fifty million viewers

[Bridge: Tone]

Uh, the Mike Jordan of rap, Mike Jackson of pop
The Mike Tyson of street, Airs with no socks
The Hugh Hef of the game, yeah it won't stop
'Til I meet the Lara Croft of the hood, it's all good
The Spielberg when I spill words to tracks
I'm a sick dude, you can't feel worse than that
For you slow-minded dudes I reverse it back
I got a sick flow, see ain't no nursin' that
But mami, if ya rock my world
I'll get you the baby bucket, you can be my baby Roc girl
The white Nike Airs, we call em' Wifey Airs
Size 4 or 5, how cute is your size
That new cute bubble, give you horses to drive
I paint that picture, 'cause ain't no nigga
Like the one you get from, Mike holla

[Michael Jackson]
I don't think they're ready for this one

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed

But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams

Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)
You rocked my world, you know you did (Girl)
And everything I'm gonna give (I want you, girl)
And there ain't nothing we could find
Someone like you to call mine

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]

My neck and back
Jigga voice his music, forget the track
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Before we lose it, Trackmasters bring it back, let's go

[Verse: Michael Jackson]
In time I knew that love would bring
This happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I waited patiently
Girl, you know it seems
My life is fully complete
Our love is true because of you
You're doin' what you do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think that I (Oh)
Have finally found the perfect love I searched for allmy life

So I brethren, I sistren

We've gotta live up, woh now, woh now!

Global intelligence
Time to save the continents
Power goes to the people
Plus there's a conflict
Cause the people sold they people refused to be equal
The same old story no sequel
True that, we're all must live as one
But the conflict lied, unless we're all get some
Gold, Silver and Diomands that we're all minin'
Got to get mines, we got to get mines

You know you want my love (Love)
I don't think the time is right (No)
Call when I'm ready, but it won't be tonight

[Verse 2 - Free]
We in the club, Free gully no doubt
See this real deal playa, starin' dead in my mouth
He got his crew, but I got mine too
Send a note to my table like, what you gonna do
Eye game got him spreadin' me out
In my ear dry tears, how he left his spouse
And oh, the nice cars, and impressive house
He want to run up in, I ain't no regular route (Hoooo!)
Me and the girls, we ain't stressin' out
We ain't birds, we ain't headin' south (Noooo!)
Them one nighters, that's sad and doubt
That little talk on da creep ,what you said is out
I gets cheddar, to help me do what ever
No beef with Dennis Edwards, but I fight temptation
I'm not sayin' I don't like temptation
I'm just lookin' for da right temptation, ya kno'

[Hook]

Now, show me that you got my back
Love me from, where you at
I got eyes up, over my shoulder
If you should decide, to get closer (Hooo!)
Well then this dance, is straight over

Twerk somethin'

Twerk somethin'

Shake that ass over here

[Mystikal]
Oh
You think I can't see you over there shakin' your ass
Watchin' you bouncin' your tities, I almost dropped my glass
I can't be trippin' on a big ol' booty
I'm supposed to be a star
When you see them tanks, you know who we are
You on a mission with your pussy
You after my papers, straight asshole naked on your way to my table
So I played it cool, and tried to act surprised
Knowin' damn well I've been watchin' this bitch from the side of my eye
She looked my in my face and said "Don't I know your name?"
You out the South, y'all bout it, you wanna get entertained?
I said B, I'm not tryin' to be too much, but I'm chillin' tonight
My mouth said no, my dick's sayin' fuckin' right
Man fuck all that shit, I ain't bout to pay this woman to party
Till she turned around, bent over, her pussy hung on my body
Damn, you know what bro, this pussy might be worth somethin'
Go ahead girl, handle your business
Twerk somethin'

[Chorus X2]

[Mia X]
There's gonna have to be a whole lotta big bills wavin' in the air
To make me shake it work it twerk it, take a nigga there
To the sky, get 'em racked up
Tryin' to have relations, dick at atten-hut
What, what
Whoa now daddy, love to love ya baby
But you know you gotta pay me, prolly got a old lady
And a few rug rats at home to feed
But you tryin' to run that line
What you think, you Gineuwine the bachelor
I'll pass you like you don't exist
And part my ass like the red sea, and tell you to kiss
You be the same nigga known to get your fuckin' mack on
And call the wife, it's so precise, and say you won't be back home
Mama's sunshine all in your face with that southern wine
Rodeo style till your toes curl and I'll be
Laying in the gap so picture perfect
Now do you really wanna see a bitch twerk it?

[Chorus X 2]
Intro: 

[Mystikal]
Man I got something to tell you
I don't know how to explain it
But I'm different (crazy)
Naaaaa....I ain't
I'm just sayin', I'm not like you
I'm not like others
It's like I've been here before

[Verse 1]
504 is the domain I don't sang
My rhyme go bang
Nigga, ain't in the place get a flame and ya act like propane
No sweat, no blood, no pain, no gain (Blade)
No cards, no deal, no dice, no game, no thangs
I'm givin' you bitches something vicious
Got 'em fallin' to pieces like porcelain dishes
I'm dirty
I get all the way down in the ground bitch
WHAT
Memorize, take a picture, nigga write a book, I don't give a fuck
I'm blended bile, ground rip up
They're here
They down to give up
Nigga you underneath, me out my entrance
Off by inches I can count a hundred thousand pennies
Help me center
Look at that, look at that, look at that, get back
I get very scary like that gatlin bitch whats happenin
I rip tracks and pop tapes
I'm so popular they just gots to rock what I spray
Time I gotta watch what I say (Blade)
I gets pride 'cause I'm from 'round where the crocodiles play
Jock-a-mo fee na nay
I make em' say
"Aww give it to me, don't be that way."
I'm tellin' ya from cuttin ya tellin what the music
I've been doin' this shit
I'm highly trained on how to use it
The objective's to apply the proper perspective
Taxes are selective, maximum effective

[?] collective
Brown complected
It just don't get no ???
I'm perfected
Y'all niggas couldn't pop a rubber band on my parade
Choppin' and slicin' with the edge of the blade
Chorus: The blade (x 24)

(clip from movie)
Blade: There are worse things out tonight than vampires
Girl: Like what?
Blade: Like me

[Verse 2]
I turn a sucka into supper
Gotta suffer
Mighta had enough
Thats why I'm cussin' (come on fucker)
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired
They can't hide from the pain 'cause the noise don't stop
They don't stand a ghost of a chance but they try
One side of my mind tell me to get 'em, other say let em' ride
Even when a couple of hundred years gone by
They still gonna bite and I'm still gonna fly
Yes... five fingers around they necks
I'll run through your back and come out your chest
You movin' too fast, you got to pace yourself
Aww shit here it comes nigga, brace yourself
Oh my goodness
Don't worry I'ma getcha no matter how I put it
Imitates, I'm limit, tall limit, tell it (Blade)
Let me finish hedgehog and answer fella
You would if you could but you don't get up off
And I'm the hand on the hammer on the nail in the coffin
I'm marchin' to a different drummer
At the head of the parade
On the edge of the blade
Chorus (x32)

[Mystikal]
Whaaa, wassup nigga?
This for my niggas in them Big Trucks
This for all my niggas in them SUV's, you heard me?
This for my Big Truck Drivers, look nigga blow yo' Big Truck Horn
You still could see me in my Big Truck boy
Smilin' like a lil' kid when I spin the corner with my brand new toy
I got 'em parkin they cars, talkin 'bout
They wish I never would've came out the garage
But, I guess that's too bad
Cause your truck used to be the shit until they saw mine pass
Strobe lights flash, solar baric *boom boom*
Big feet ten runnin' while they *vroom vroom*
Another SUV can't do nothin' wit' me
I'm on 23's so 22's ain't fuckin' with me
Car so big it make it hard to turn the wheel
I can't watch the T.V.'s from the steering wheel
Shit, plush stronger than the buckskin ceiling
Chocolate tan interior billet big truck grill
Yeah, that's how you do that there
Got bling and bass, everything clean but the ashtray

[Hook: Byou2ful] (Mystikal)
I'm lookin' at you behind the wheel
Singin' this song (I'm a Big Truck Driver)
In the big ol' truck, with the big ol' grill
Rollin' on big ol' chrome (I'm a Big Truck Driver)
And you know when you pass those small trucks you doin' them wrong
(This is for my riders Big Truck Drivers
Even on a bad day everything clean but the ash-tray)

[Mystika]
Dark lights with brights, the dark windows
With the pistols in the hot spots fuckin' well right
So when you bitches try to act hype
I get the gat get the gat cause niggas don't fight
When you get to Ruby Tuesday's then make a right at the light
And you might catch my rims will-millin' 'round night light
I played a Jag' 'round Raggs, and now Excursion and Escalade 'round Upscale
The Range Rover don't even get used
Til' it's time for Rhythm City or either House of Blues
My niggas wit' me at your seat to pick my friends up
My brother Reece in a motherfuckin Benz truck
Fresh wax don't need no buffin'
Just call a homie where I'm at, West Coast Custom
Put it on a trailer and ain't no rushin'
Cause when I get it back y'all ride can't touch it

[Hook]

[Mystikal]
Ain't no slack in my mack, rollin' slow the windows down
They recognize me so you know how they act
Cuttin' up fallin' out tryin' to flirt and get nasty
Raisin' shirt showin' titties talkin' 'bout autohgraphs
I try my best to keep my fans happy
I sign my name I grab the nipple they pull off and start laughin'
Then it's back through the hood, tryin' to find somethin' good
And after that I'm on my way to Baton Rouge
I knew that I'm on course at all time
And I love grindin' like alcoholics love sweet premium wine
2002 and you dodgin' me now
Big Truck gonna come up ain't no holdin' us down
Grab eyes, turn heads, stop traffic
My black Big Truck half match my Big Truck jacket
Do shows and get paid when I travel stay busy it be gone
Now this a Big Truck Driver

[Hook 2x]

[Mystikal]
I'm a Big Truck Driver, I'm a Big Truck Driver
This is for my riders Big Truck Drivers
Even on a bad day everything clean but the ash-tray
Time to get with ya
What ya think nigga
Time to get with ya
What ya think nigga

I already done told ya niggas
Shit I showed y'all niggas
When I slaughtered ya niggas
This how I sold ya niggas
Bitch if ya put yourself in a fight
Here me kick it
I get flashlight how we get it with it specific and artistic
Spare rhymes and rough drafts get it done tighter
I stay clear you cut the war underwear
I'll hold ya back nigga cause ya shystie
When my blood start bubblin I get fystie
Laced with cyanide
Hard education if somebody try to bite me
Scratchy, flows come across hypely
Closer than your fuckin icy
Reaching my level is highly unlikely
Precisely I'm the right king I be
Why in the sam hell would you take it upon yourself to ever try me
Got be suffering some type of fault or malfunction
You don't want this situation to get both dangerous and rambunctious
Why y'all be thinking about beef I be thinking bout big numbers
On top of things running shit why you bitches going under
If I take your ass on this track it'll probably defeat the purpose
Cause that half ass material you putting out
Probably ain't gone never surface
You harmless, you couldn't blow the bomb up
Couldn't keep up the pace I set
I'll whoop your ass with my warm-ups
Entertainer rap composer and performer
Map located on the southern corner
I'm making the way like they at a parade
Niggas get fitted for graves for going for brave
When them bullets get sprayed
So I ain't no hangman no gang bang
Shit, I'm trying to change things
We stuck on the same thang
Stealing draws from Les Unplauge
Then I can go back to the trunks of cars of the upper esilonge
Blunts and guns roll like M1s tasers
Smoke weed all the way to the bank
Nigga what the fuck you think

[Chorus]

What cha thank nigga

[Verse-2]

Fuck ya'll niggas think bad lines and bad words serving their purpose
Doing videos and movie soundtracks and tv commercials
Independent, smoke herb
Walking this thing throughout your suburb
Got young niggas switching suburbans
The tempo I run when I run around like a tortoise
Your mom say run when I hear they come
Ta get they titty slick and they pussies murdered
Low down dirty
Big old niggas burn down the barn to make million dollar merges
Never mix no bullshit with your business
I'll snatch ya pull your head out ya ass that mothafuckin stay down
There til I finish
If I cut ya down I'm gone make you look bad
I'm gone make them look at you
The same way they look at the back of a dog's ass
Hit it tell us, stomp through this mothafucka like elephants
Swing though this bitch like apes and fly by you bitches like pelicans
Playa haters are of no relevance
I'm striving on intelligence
And changing like them elements
If you was up to my level I'd probably wail all on ya
But you ain't bitch you bumb time don't tell on ya
What the fuck you think its time to come up
And profit off the shit we sell
Rode the band with BL why I gotta chance to back up with KL
Nigga next to me your shit be seeming fake
You bests to move your fucking finger
While I cuts my piece off the tank cake
Move them ugly mothafuckas show me your mean face
But stick your fingers in your mothafucking ears
Cause these niggas be dropping some mean bass
Cause it ain't gone be no more after me
It ain't no limit to these young black hustlers
Ask that nigga Master P
It has to pe the paper if ya ask me man
Ya'll niggas know ya can't hang
Nigga, what the fuck you think

[Chorus till fade]

[Treach] No Limit

[Myst.]  Naughty!

[Treach] Da bomb Ill

[Myst.]  Mystikal!

[Treach] IllTown

[Myst.]  Da Big Eazy.. (oh shit) HAH!

[Chorus: Treach (2X)]
Dirty South, Dirty Jerz, nigga fuck what ya heard
Your talk words don't serve while we slang on the curb
We take it from a fuckin fight to a stage and a mic
If I don't take the limo bitch I'm pushin a bike
* 2X - last line replaced with YEAYY-YAY! *

[Mystikal]
Us big niggas get pussy while songs get cooked
Fuck rough rhymes get hooked and young minds get shook
Duck, don't rock, don't break, don't bend, don't fall
Not gon' play, don't fake, don't stop to rest don't pause none
Top dough top pro on bitches
Chop funk, not gon' bitch ass niggas
I wring they neck and slap they fuckin mouth
I run laps around the Superdome
Breast stroke the whole Mississippi to represent THE FUCKIN SOUTH
That's right, I said it!
I'm the fuckin boxer in your face is where I'm headed
Blaow, you gotta whole lot of nerve dissin the.. South
We ridin all the way to Jersey
We gon' keep up, but you keep on, keepin on
Y'all gon', keep on, gettin the fuck on, bitch get gone!
Y'all heard me?  Mystikal and Naughty
New Orleans and Jersey!

[Chorus]

[Vinnie]
Yo, yo, yo
I heard somebody wantin Naughty to get raw, ha
I dismantle your fuckin crew just like Apartheid, nigga ya heard?
There's No Limit no gimmicks, to the shit I spit
Ain't no magazine you know could count these mics I rip
Comin straight from Jersey, motherfuck all those who curse me
I'm, running through you niggas like Jackie Joyner Kersee
Now, how many niggas comin better than this?
Naughty By Nature puts it down on some veteran shit
And chins I devour, while fuckin at your baby shower
Spittin lyrics on you a hundred miles an hour
Our Zoo got no problems gettin physical
Naughty By Nature down with Mystikal, you bitches foul

[Chorus]

[Treach]
You get your ass kicked when your only assets is ass bets
You cry quicker than Angela Bassett, cause your cassette
I'll trash it, like potatoes, beets, I'll mash it
Bust dust to dust and turn ashes to ashes in masses
I'm massive mashing bastards faster
Question bout my pimping tell your bitch to ask it
Chip-chop like all tops the store stops (it stops here)
Cause I'm raws likes strawberries on shortstops (it comes now)
The Beast from the East, the big future for the pharoah
Diss my crew, do some spine travel on gravel
Some fuhrilla shit, go and, peel your shit
I want my, scrilla quick, on some gorilla shit
Rhyme illest, no mimic, no quit it, gon' feel it
IllTown, divine mill it, No Limit, fuck the spillage some
Hear my shit and go and switch they style
While I get down and wild with Mystikal

[Chorus]

Bring it louder if you coming to rap
Your arms to short your legs to small
I'm the sure shot shit off of deputy dog
Break it in two and TRU so do
By myself I can take you and you and you and you
Straight forward like Kerry Kittles
Nigga's head bob very little
Gooder than a whole hand full of skittles
Evil with feedback when I turn on the mic
I'm the spritz that has to "Chsssss" when you open your Sprite
No fight no war no brawl y'all ain't ready
When they see me their eyes get big arms get sweaty
Enough to go around you know exactly how it go down
In house uptown big boys throw down
Out of control ballers from Bagwood back to New Orleans
If it'll make ya feel good that's what you can call it

Laid back and masturbated
Take them fake wood strips off the side of you ride
Cause real niggas keep their war on the inside that's money with pride
Shell shock niggas

[Mystikal] The mans right here
What the fuck?  Shit..
It's.. HOT!
I'm steamy, sweatin, tossin and turnin
The whole house on fire, and I can't stop it from burnin
The curtains and the walls all indulged in flames
I yell, "Somebody help me!"  But ain't nobody pay em
I try my best to put it out then I said, "Fukkit!"
Break, full speed to the back door, one room away
But the faster and harder I ran it seemed like the longer I took
Prayin, "Please God spare me; I don't wanna cook!"
Knew I that I did done some things that I shouldn't of
I knew I didn't come into Sunday service like I could have
But have mercy for your child, forgive me for my sins
I'm too young to die Lord, get me through this
I gotta get to the back do', gotta get to the kitchen
But they got thick black smoke comin from the kitchen
Shit, all other exits are tossed, what I'ma do?
Stay my ass here and burn or -- RUN THE FUCK THROUGH?
Already havin trouble breathin when I started to cough
But no more time to waste, I cover my face and took off!
Dis-en-dehydrate, I'm gettin tireder
I gotta, keep movin, cause it's gettin HOTTER
And HOTTER, WHOO.. WHOAH, shit!  I'm on fire!
C-c-call them people to me, I-I-I'm on fire! (6X)

Oh shit!  Ain't none of y'all motherfuckers help me out dere?
HELP!!!  Motherfuckers it's me!  HELP!!!

I gotta get out of here!  I've been trapped for over 55 minutes
Looks like I'm finished, this could be a fucked up ending
I done been in some fucked up shit but this the worst I ever been in
"Call them people to me" -- tell them send the fire engine
I hope this ain't my calling y'all cause I ain't ready
I'ma need some alerted emergency units to stand by, paramedics
Runnin through the fire, and I can't turn back
Somethin went {WHOOSH} and everything went black
I can't see, I can't see, I'm BLIND!!
Oh fuck I'm alright I just had my eyes closed the whole time
Oops, shit damn!  But that ain't my stop my shoes from movin
Cause outside, here I am!
I smashed through the back door like a ram
I made it!  I'm still alive!  I'm still the man!
Out the house but still I got fire on my clothes
So I stopped, dropped, and rolled dick rolled
Started goin wild on the ground tryin to get the flames out my shirt
Windmillin in the dirt, but nuttin didn't work!
I heard a {HORN SOUNDS} but that was just a barge
See I live right by the river -- THAT'S IT, WATER!!!
Every step I took made hot footprints in the tar
Runnin over cars to the 12th Ward wall
Get out the way cause everything I touch turn crispy
I'ma be at the riverfront, tell them people come get me!!
C-c-call them people to me, I-I-I'm on fire! (4X)

Hello?  Somebody get the fuckin fire off me!
HELP!

Sparks like aluminum foil, in the microwave oven
Where them fuckin people?  SOMEBODY DO SOMETHIN!
Can't you see what's hap-pe-nin?
Don't you see the smoke?  Can't you hear the cracklin?
Nobody wanna listen, everybody was scatterin
I grab a nigga he screamed so loud that shit was eardrum shatterin!
I said, "Don't scream Dawg, I need your help, I'm the one on fire!"
He said, "Nigga you 'sposed to be dead, how you still alive?"
He was right -- by now they should be embalming me
But the shit don't seem to be harming me
Damn this must have been a bad dream the whole ?
I heard them motherfuckin sirens, hollerin
I guess they finally got the people to me, they must have saw me
Huh, cause they was headed right for me
A fireman walked up, and handed me a tape
And said, "You just been put out, the fire went away!"
Testin testin testin
You can hear me, what what what?
MIC, check one, check, check check
You can hear me?  YO!
I'm loud enough?  Yo!
Mic mic, micraphone, check, check
Yo, can you hear me?
Yo!

Chorus: repeat 2X (w/ variations throughout)

YIKES!!!  You know what I like?  (What?)
I keep it hype, the words that I write  (Oh)
I rock the whole crowd, I don't need a mic  (Huh?)
I say my rhyme LOUD, with all of my might

Verse One:
People say that nigga CRAZY, I'm throwin off
I raise my voice up then, GO OFF!!
The king of different, titan of screamin chantin louder than
A hundred people clappin (GO) keep them fuckin speakers crackin
Rockin it, about to ROLL
The sticker on the tag can't make it ragged
Vocals that'll blow horns til your ass in traction
Disgusting like that bell on your bike with the basket
BLING BLING comin through, not excuse me
I'm the nigga that's makin this loud ass music
Chorus

Verse Two:
The doctor slapped my ass, so I've been hollerin since an infant
Gotta make sure they hear me cause I wants my attention!
Disturb the class, so I stayed in detention
Couldn't whisper when I was talkin so they sent me to the office
The principal say, "Young man what seem to be the problem?"
Said, "I try to be quiet but I just can't seem to lower the volume"
"Hmm, what's your name?" -- "Michael Tyler"
"Perhaps you'd be interested in joining our school choir?"
Said, "Nah that's for funny boys"
"Either that or a suspension," while you roll, HERE I COME BOY
I wanna holla, but I gotta try: *clears throat*
DOE RAY MI FAH SOH!  Ahh no!
That ain't gonna cut it, that ain't gonna get it
Then the teacher said, "Maybe you can try something ath-letic"
But I'm too clumsy so I went to the band
But I made more noise honkin than I did when I was playin!
YIKES!!!  That ain't workin so I'm leavin
The very next day I was in ROTC
Had no problems soundin off like I had a pair, THREE FOUR
But I just ain't like them tight ass green pants that I had to wear
All this ? made me tired, on top of that
One of my teachers wanna see my ass outside
I went downstairs to the yard
When I got there I seen my teacher with about eight fine broads
I said, "You lookin for me?  I'm the one who be talkin loud"
She said, "Damn, nigga we need you on our cheerleadin squad"
HELL NO, never ever Trevor
Either that or a report card filled with the F letter
GO, TEAM, FIGHT, WIN
Nah this shit ain't cool, FUCK THESE TEACHERS AND THIS SCHOOL
Got a loud mouth but I don't know what to use it for
'til they told me that they was gon' put me in the TALENT SHOW
Chorus

* lots of repetitions of YIKES!!! Y-Y-Y-YIKES!!! *

[Intro: Mystikal]
Since I'm so fucking bad
Give me mine
Get yours
Ooooh...

[Mystikal]
I woke up this morning
Rocked up
Humping on the matress
Hard like I was fuckin
I realized I was dreaming
Then I got up
I hit the Vick's inhaler
'cuz my nose was stuffed up
From the bed to the floor
To the bathroom to the sink
From the mirror to the toilet
Took a piss then shook the shank
Oops, dont look know I think I sprinkled when I tinkled
So, I did what the sign said, "be a sweetie, wipe the seatie"
Cocoa powder, bubble-bath, and rubbing alcohol
For 5 fuckin cent that you could buy at the mall
I'm a long distance super-power, pussy-magnet
I was born in the ghetto, made by the ghetto
So fabulous!

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
Ghetto fabulous - living like this
I'm so happy, yeah!
'cuz I'm ghetto fabulous (repeat)

[Snoop Dogg over Chorus]
Yeah I feel what you're saying, Dog
But, uhh, you could let these fools know how hard it is
When a nigga ghetto fabulous, know what I'm saying?
Let's kick that shit!

[Mystikal]
It's like a big rush with no time
Niggas be like "whyyyyy"
Kids be like "let me get your autograph"
Bitches be like "ahhhh!"
Ever since I said "here I go"
Braids or not y'all
They know me wherever I go
I'm real private
The windows tinted, doors locked
They'll crowd you, make a scene
"Ain't you Mystikal?"
"No, I'm not."
Lie to a die hard fan with a straight face
And let the hour long picture signing session take place
Sign, hey, baby, how you doing?
What's your name?
Stay real, stay sweet
Stay sexy, stay the same
And never forget
I'm never going to change
I'm loving what I'm doing
And you can put that on your game
I got my piece of pie and my piece of mind
Fool, I'm a piece of coal
Don't crowd me, people, let me shine
I know you see me on t.v
With Snoop, Fiend, Mia, C, Silkk, Serv, and Petey
Nigga we run these street-ies
But livin' like this ain't easy
It's fabulous!
I'm so fucking bad

[Chorus]

[Mystikal]
See, that's a cutie with her big booty
And her big body
Her and her big fine posse
Take their ??? and take their vitamins
Be ordering drinks all down at the bar
We don't got to buy
Just work that halter top
And work them tight bell bottoms
Ohhh, you acting funny and trying to holla
She project Tyra Banks
The neighborhood super-model
She shaped like a coke bottle
Hair whipping smelling good
Finger nails and her toes polished
She get it how she live
Cause she got to have it
First drop them fucking kids by they baby's daddy
Her ass ain't never what she should have been
Go ahead on and act bad, I'll see ya when I get a hit
See, she was so fucking bad

[Chorus]

[Silkk] (Mystikal)
Man these niggas...
They might have to learn the hard way
(Y'all gon' learn!)
Y'all gon' learn
(Yeah y'all gon' learn!)
Mystikal, Snoop nigga, Silkk the Shocker nigga
(They gon' learn!)
(We gon' teach em!)

[Mystikal] (Silkk)
Nah! Come on come on
(Come on!)
Come on nah, come on
Come on come on
(What, what)
Come on (Come on)
Nah!

[Mystikal]
I'm quick to bang bang bang, pop pop pop
I'll kick in the fuckin door before I knock knock knock
You gon' duck duck duck when I buck buck buck
Actin bad bad bad and I'm fuckin somethin up
Lay yo shit down, I'm comin to get down
Count my money, 20,000 dollars times my shoe size when I get  down
To a big eyed, big pussied big bootied bitch I'm cute
But to a motherfuckin buster I'm a sabretooth
I'm comin to get you, ain't no savin you
I'm five times stronger than the hate for niggas in the heart
Of David Duke
I take your style from ya, and your pride from ya
I turn ya upside down, shake the dope out you
And take your high from ya
I'll bless ya, way before the ha-choo
Can't nobody fuck this bitch up like I do

[Chorus:] X 6
Let's go do it! Nah!
Let's go do it! Let's do it!

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm at my pad actin bad and my bitch got me mad
But I'm gon let my khakis sag and continue to mash
Blue flag around my head, gold tank on my chest
Motherfuck y'all niggas talkin shit out west
I'm down south hustlin, crushin, bustin on punk busters
I know them niggas wanna rush us, but can't touch us
When y'all see us, a hundred thousand deep, duck us
I keep a can of repellent for you suckers, motherfuckers
What the fuck y'all figure?
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah I'm still that same old nigga
Gang bangin, P don't mind, I feel ya
Dogg Pound crip on mine, and I kill ya
If you cross that line, it's a thin line
Between the nine millimeter and that hairline
Trigger, nigga, cap peelers and drug dealers
Real niggas feel us, especially them bonafide cold hard killers
Now I know y'all niggas don't want us to get things crackin
With all that jaw jackin you bitch ass niggas keep yappin
I'm slappin niggas in they face for the nine eight
Let's go do this Mystikal, what the fuck we waitin for nigga?

[Chorus]

[Silkk]
Get up, like a robbery, nigga fuck fuck
That's real cuz after I rob a nigga, what what
Y'all don't want no problems with us us
Problem here, let them niggas go, followed by a buck buck
So forget what you sayin nigga fuck you and fuck who you with
You shoulda know motherfuckers, who you were fuckin with
Silkk the Shocker motherfucker, that's my last time
Made Man, motherfucker, little brother of the Last Don
Niggas talkin about you got beef with this nigga
All hoods talkin about you better have a meet with this nigga
How could I beef with this nigga?
Cuz that's that nigga, (Who?) That's that nigga
(Who you talkin about?) Everybody talkin about
(That's him?) That's that nigga
I can sleep with my heat, I can even sleep with a freak
I can do a lot of things, I just can't sleep with no beef
Like you can't eat with no teeth you can't rob the police
Just like you can't cook with no heat
When I get to comin, ain't no comin wet
When I get to bustin, fuck all y'all, ain't no comin back
See you shoulda known, I wasn't scared of no nigga
All Mystikal and Snoop gotta say is one thing
Talk about, let's go get em

[Chorus till fade]

[Intro: Master P]
Woman like my momma
Ain't no woman like my momma (11X)

[Master P]
Sharin liquor with the homies, reminiscin bout the old days
Cookin dinner in your kitchen listenin to the Bar-Kays
When I was sick, you came got me from school
When I got suspended momma, you taught me the rules
And even though, I never had a daddy
Momma took me where I need to go in a old school caddy
A single parent on welfare
And even though times were hard momma made sure the rent was there
And we couldn't fold name brands
But momma kept her kids neat, that's why we understand
And momma even rode the Greyhound
To see her little man, when he was locked down
And even though I life the STREET LIFE
Momma prayin for her baby, hope he get his mind right
It feel good to see momma on top
I told you if I make it momma you won't be forgot

[Chorus: repeat 2X]

[singers]  Momma life ain't cool

[Master P] Ain't no woman like my momma

[singers]  Tell me what would I do without you

[Master P] Ain't no woman like my momma

[Mystikal]
I thank God, for keeping you strong, but you keep me strong
Things'd be different if, momma wasn't home
Who gon' fix the grits and eggs and smoked sausage
Teach me and love me and raise me and watch me
Who gon' lift my spirits when I get sad?
Discipline me when I need a stain whip on my ass
I was seven years old when I lost dad
Trying to accept the fact but I was too young to understand
Who gon' take the slack and carry the load?
Make ends meet while in the grocery stores?
Who's the single parent to me and my big sister
That had me happy on my birthday and merry at Christmas?
Who took care of us, did everything for us?
Stood by and didn't leave, just because
We was yours, she was ours
Who was still sweet when everything went sour?
You mom!

[Chorus]

[Silkk the Shocker]
I couldn't imagine gettin this far, without you
Even when the bills was due, you found a way to come through
Even though we didn't have money, we seemed rich
We had each other me and my sisters and brothers, forget the other shit
You was side by side when I was sick
Early in the morning, cooking eggs and grits
You was the first one up, but you was the last one sleepin
Made sure we had somethin to eat, last one to eatin
Couldn't live our life for us so, let us know
Wanted to tell us, but you had to just, let us grow
Gettin older now, soon have to, let us go
We was goin through some things momma but you never, let it show
And I only get one of you so I, cherish the times
Didn't know how to tell you how much you meant to me
So I wrote that line
So wherever you at, I hope you doin fine
You did so much for me then, I'll do the same for you in time

[Chorus]

[Chorus w/o Master P]
Me that's who
Me me that's who
Me me that's who
I'm the round out the tank
I'm the round out the tank
I'm the round out the tank
I'm the loud blacca blacca, wacca wacca coming from
Behind cha
Me that's who

(Chorus X 2)

I'm the "weee" before the "boom"
I'm the fire in the hole coming from the tube
I'm the claymore mine sittin in the dirt
I'm the prone unsupported
I'm "doom doom doom" three round burst
Sleepin bag in the freezin weather
I'm the fragmentation vest for shrapnel and flyin metal
I'm the auto on the fire selector
I'm the thousand shells bouncin off the brass deflector
Squeeze the trigger center mass when it's time to take aim
I'm the "waahhhaa" boom when they ricochet down range
Creeping, heat seekin and keepin my target
I'm that biological threat you don't wanna go to war wit
Listen here I make you fuckin grave where you live at
I'm almost there one click away from yo' bivouac
Flash bang, highly illuminated
This is operation fuck over my destination
(Chorus X 2)

Ha, I'm all you rank and ribbons strips and brass and decorations
I'm that fucking hole in the earth after detonation
C 130 airborne soldier coming from the sky
Recognize ground troopers rolling just like hemmit tires
I'm fixin my road march so save ya breath
If I don't get cha with the rifle I'm a catch cha with my bayonette
I run with M1's, tanks and howtzers
I'm a 45 day 45 night field problem
I'm yo' smart book when the live exercise begins
And when it get dark I'm noise and light discipline
Twelve bravo run you out the foxhole
Make it to the bunker or it ain't no survival
I'm that war vet that's combat ready
Whether arctic or jungle or the middle of the desert
They try to make it when they know they can't
How the fuck yo gon run from the round out the tank

[Intro]
I'm in the land
L.A., land of the sticky
What y'all niggas know bout that purple weed nigga?
Show y'all niggas some shit, it's that sticky, that bud
Indo, hydro, open up the window, I'm bout to blow
That fire shit, nigga what ch'all, what ch'all got
What ch'all got to roll 'em up?
Backwoods?
Garcia Vegas?
Straight chocolate Phillies?
Nigga straight, can get down with that
Nigga I'll twist it in the Black n Milds
Y'all niggas don't know nothin' about them Coronas
Cognac?
J.O.B., one point five?

[Verse]
Break it up, chop it up, cut it up, tuck the end
Take the filler out and roll it up
Light it, hit it, hold it, pass it
Puff puff blow it up
See some of y'all niggas be talkin' about blowin'
But can't handle the doja
Getting sleepy an' shit, quittin' all early
Bitch you ain't no smoker
Y'all must think used to hittin' that dirt
The sticks with the brown buds
Me, I ain't got shit else to do
Nigga, I'm 'bout to get fucked up
Two cases of green Optimos burned away
A.M. done turned to P.M
And nighttime done turned back to day
I'm, still smokin'
Feelin' sporty in my hotel - spent the whole day gettin' loaded
It's nothin' but smoke til there's nothin' to smoke
It's nothin' but sticky and nothin' but doja
Disconnect the smoke detector and
Put a wet towel up under the door
Nobody around me mo' dope for me, I got the whole tree
Leftovers for me, whoo this bitch off the hee
Button up 'cause suck 'em up is a pet peeve
First don't put my lighter in your pocket
Second don't wet my goddamn weed
That's just two, before I could get to three and fo'
Five and six, I heard a DUM DUM DUM DUM at the do'
Evidence all over, I've been doin' somethin' serious
Gotta hide this shit, 'cause I know that's hotel security
I played it off, I said come back later I ain't got on no clothes
He said, sorry sir, I don't mean to disturb ya, but I smell smoke
Fuck it just went to jail for that shit; I ain't goin' back
I done ate an ounce and I'mma flush the rest
'Cause I ain't goin' out like that
Sprayin' cologne and cuttin' on the shower; tryin' to clear it up
Workin' like a dog but I gotta open the do' - fuck it here go nothin'
The door swung open and some young nigga, talkin' bout  "What's happenin'?"
He said, "I know you got that fire, sell your boy a sack"

[Outro]
Ain't that a bitch
Boy if you don't get your bitch ass up outta here...
Nigga I'm thinkin' you the motherfuckin' police
I done threw all my motherfuckin' weed away
Fuckin with you old bitch-ass nigga
Nigga, get your motherfuckin' ho-ass up outta here
Bitch before I stomp your bitch ass, the fuck
Boy this nigga done blew my motherfuckin' high
Fuckin right I'm hip-hop
I hoe hop, I'm funky as a pair of Reeboks with no socks
I'm hot like a nigga watchin a big titty bitch with no bra
I'm tight like them twistin up under the 6 with no top
I've been up all night
Writing like a motherfucker cluck with no clock
Been platinum and I'm still stompin
Rock jam-packed concerts and bitch filled parties
Done had them standin more than a hot comb when I perform
Gotta em feelin like they in Saigon when they hear what I got
I got funk
No Limit legitimate respect the man of power
I turn your motherfuckin thunderstorm into scattered showers
Yo Bam, bitches can't get down
Like me and the Pound can, we ain't gotta bring up SoundScan
I come into focus when they all starin
I turn your fuckin head and, spin your fuckin ball bearings
Hit the antenna so they all scatterin
Believe that cause I'm tellin you
They don't challenge what they can't handle
M-Y-S-T-I
Smoke spinach, eat chicken, shit bullets, SPIT FIRE
I'm above you like the sky
Like the clouds like the Gods like the birds and the pilots
You know why I'm here, come to say it loud
For the one-thousand nine-hundred and nine nine
To infinity and BEYOND
Now.. now.. now.. now.. bitch
Respect my motherfucking mind
Fuck what you feelin, fuck what you think
Bitch I kill you
Respect my fucking mind
Fuck what you think, fuck what you feelin
Bitch I kill you
Respect my mind
Fuck what you think, fuck what you feelin
Bitch I kill you
Respect my fucking mind
Bitch I kill you, bitch I kill you
I said BITCH I KILL YOU

Back-bending, That's That Nigga spinning
Y'all done feeling my line before I finish my SENTENCE
This microphone's for holdin
I don't give a fuck, as quick as you bring them niggas
Then that's how fast them niggas get FUCKED OVER
No prisoners at no time
I'm so advanced I put your ass in the blender
With my OWN rhyme, bitch say, "Damn that nigga tight!
I heard what he did to that other rapper that other night
And Dawg that shit wasn't right!"
I'm nothin nice in the shinin lights
No band, no choir, just me and my fucking Nike's
But am I missing something?  FUCK NO
I got the whole crowd bucked up, "UH OHHH!"
I smash a rapper into smithereens
Make him spill his beans
Then I'm running with the guillotine
Diss on my rhymes bitch and diss on my records
Diss on my moms bitch you gon' respect it!
Respect my fucking mind
Fuck what you thinkin, fuck what you feelin
Bitch I kill you
Respect my mind
Fuck what you feelin, fuck what you thinkin
Bitch I kill you
Respect my mind
Fuck what you feelin, fuck what you thinkin
Bitch I kill you
Respect my fucking mind
Fuck what you feelin, fuck what you thinkin
Bitch I kill you
Respect my mind
Bitch I kill you, bitch I kill you, bitch I kill you
Respect my fucking mind
Bitch I kill you, bitch I kill you, bitch I kill you!

Razor sharp rhymes penatrating you skin
The way I drop
Bitch gotta feel them

Try to stop me from gettn' it

[Hook]

[C-Murder]
I make a million dollar dream become reallity without a doubt
I get paid for every rhyme coming out my mouth
And gangsta rap pays the bills so I represent it
And who we be
Some soldiers down that no limit
My young thugs love to get high off of my lyrics
I have em' tweakn'
Possessed like an evil spirit
We on the rise
But labeled as them bad guys
We're family tied
And run like the enterprize
Fool is you legal
But bugs is segal
This ain't no sequil
You damn sure not my equal
And playa haters don't last too long
A million muthafuckas with my disc
Sittin at they home
My edvasaries is slowly being put to death

[Chorus:] X 8
Yaah! (Say what?)

[Verse 1]
Break my joint, cut my tongue off if I ain't tight
Put a bullet in my head take my life and let me die if I ain't fire
Cut me up feed me to the roaches, let me rot if I don't rock
Let me go to hell, burn, sizzle and simmer if I don't deliver
Pull my hair out if I sell out
Bury me on my stomach without no drawers on at all if I don't go off
Or either lethal injection or straight electricity
Let the garbage man pick me up and get rid of me
If I lose creativity
Let me get forced into sexual activity
Let me get turned out by three skank freaks if I don't bust to
The utmost of my ability
Take my head if I say it and don't feel it
Stop selling my record, give me the money back nigga
If I don't sell at least a million
Cut my dick off if I get down and don't get off
Crush my spine and cave my chest in if I come (.?.)
If I ain't bad for my age and kick ass for my size
Close my fuckin eyes if you can stop me from sayin or keep me from playin

[Chorus] X 16

[Verse 2]
Snap my pencil, dislocate my fingers and jam my thumb
I ain't gon' write no more, tear my papers, strip clothes if
It don't ship gold
Take my blessed, Baptist Holy Ghost Christian soul
If it take less than a year of playin my records and tapes
Before they can say my shit old
If it don't bang, take me out the game, call me out my name
Put me out my house, beat me out my change
Let em read my poem and tell em to seal my doom
When I'm dead read bitch ass nigga in the ground
Written across my tomb
Let the breeze take my leaves if my trees don't bloom
Put me in the sun and cut my air supply
If I give these niggas breathin room
If what I'm brewin ain't potent
If what I'm doin ain't rollin
Nigga, diss me, make a movie, talk about it on Oprah
Erase my fuckin vocals, burn my fuckin notebooks
Take my fuckin tank from me and give it back to Goldman
I quit, my career's over
Turn me upside down and hang me from my scrotum

Da da da daah
MC's!
Da da da daah
Da da da daah
MC's!
Da da da daah

[Chorus] X 8

[Verse 3]
Give me my post office application if I ain't hear from rap
Nothin if they ass ain't shake and they hands ain't clap
Take my happiness if it just so happens I ain't happenin
Let something happen to me if I ain't hardcore at it maximum
Flip the dial change the channel if I can't handle
Forget me if I leave this bitch
Before I put my fuckin Grammy on the mantle
Let my next fifty concerts get cancelled
If I'm scared in front the camera
Then take my fuckin talent, take me from my family
Sneak me, fuck over me if I don't represent Louisiana
Jump my fence if I ain't the prince
Bitch keep me back if I can't keep up with the presidents
If I don't run circles around these other rap guys
Let my momma Benz catch four flat tires

[Chorus till fade]

That's what the fuck I'm hearin in my head
Yaah!
That's what keep me going
Yaah!
That's what make me fuck over you
Yaah!
I can't stop that voice
Yaah!

Bitch I'm on a mission
Not the one to be mixed up from this nigga and that nigga
Hundred percent, full blooded natural, rap whipper
Ass kicker, mad spliffer, back flipper
That much colder than the last nigga
Come from my pops so y'all ain't fucking with me
I come to get down, its time to get down
I think u chicken bust a cap
I'm the one mixed with Duggery and Master P Ugh!
Mystikal and Busta Rhymes
Ohh shit the shocker and the guillitine
Down, now put my gun on fire
One eight zero zero can't nobody fly
Like the cotton off your bottem then its gotta be me
Late at night, lights out, you in a perminent sleep
Ain't many of these niggas coming harder than me
Flip Mode, No Limit, who you thought it would be?

[Chorus: Mystikal & Busta Rhymes]
Wacha want nigga?
Wacha need nigga?
We gonna give it to ya
Untill u bleed nigga
Now where my live niggas?

Untill u bleed nigga
Now where my live niggas?

[Busta Rhymes]
Contact we will bomb that All I know is they will make a nigga
We will omb back when we contact For better or worse
Make a niggas heart sweell up and burst
You know one of my niggas busting shots first
Bust another shot off into the earth
Leave a nigga stressed Feeling the pain of a women giving child birth See now a days everywhere we go we'll carry ya
Even when we swinging with bitches down at the Mariot
Chickens that will bust back on you and the ferries that
Waiting for me to marry ya Ride up in my chariot
Sorry but I ain't having it Thinking u can roll cause you wearing a
Little glamour and acting all irogant
Bitch Nigga Beet it like Micheal and fuck up you cycle
Blast you with my grandfather's rifle
I'm great to stifle
Bitch Create a crises your paying the prises
With the devil you was never richeous
I think i might just, hit you now?
You know u can fold here, niggas know it ain't all there
Prepare for warfare, niggas is everywhere
Fuck with my niggas we are double there
Flip Mode nigga you'll find trouble here
Tipsy and turning, crispy and burning
Hoping and learning You yerning to take hold of a niggas burning
Reps for every grain of salt from every street corner
The ones you wanted from Brooklyn to the south of the border
No Limit and Flip Mode in this bitch
While Mystikal and Busta Rhymes be straight busting your shit

[Chorus]

[Mystikal]
I want another side of fries with my poppa's chicken and bisquit
Take the wall out
Fall out I'm not playing with these dumb bitches
What you doing if your riches don't fit ya?
Ball playing and
Swinging on a track
We some big old niggas
Not some dead old niggas
Bitch you trying to do something
I'm gonna get on with ya
I'm scratchy!
You can't match
I'm known for getting nasty
With my ciggerette ass
Once I get this fucker started you can't stop
Oww you done fucked up now
Mystikal and Busta Rhymes like Dolomite and Red Fox
They frightened of the braids, running from the dread lox

[Chorus]

[Intro: Mia X (Mystikal)]
MC..  (Whoa)
This is your motherfuckin time nigga, you ready?  (Huh bro?)
You sho' you ready?  (Fuckin right.. nigga what?!)
Fuck that mask we don't need no mask
They know who we is anyway!
What we gon' do, is go in here, handle our business
Take everything and break out
You feelin me?  (*gun cocks*)
Well let's let them niggas have it

[Mia X]
This is a stick, up, MC's lay it down
We got the clout in this bitch so don't be fuckin around
Got the rap game locked, spittin what they feelin
Makin all the money, got em say we rackateering
Y'all fearing No Limit, black owned and operated
Uncle Tom's and Lil' Sambo's get annihilated
Y'all ain't tolerated, cause only soldiers ride with T-R-U
On the Tank full of lyricists, hustlers, and gorillas
Killers, and we do what we gotta do to make it happen
All action, all cappin, fuck yappin
Mappin, out the industry, gon' blow this joint
And take the royalties, the publishin and all the points right with us
It's the Black Prince and the Biggest Mama
Shootin sparks from the top of the Billboard charts
Watch out now, don't nobody move, cause you gon' lose
Then we takin everything, cause we brought the right tools

[Hook: Fiend (repeat 2X)]

Give it up, give it up, or get fucked up
It's gon' happen point blank range, so don't even duck
We lust to bust, turnin bitches to dust
Always your ass if you don't give it up

[Mystikal]
Black Prince in this bitch with the Biggest Mom of em all
Out of sight, when we unite, like killers and George
Slowly, unlock the safe on the wall
Stop disrespectin the pistol I'm pointin at y'all
Buck buck!  Get down, get on your face or get handled
Bitch keep still 'fore I make an example
Cut up that fuckin remake, and give me that sample
Give me the fuckin recoup, you 'sposed to be payin me!
Bag the loot then, cover the camera
Snatch a fuckin hostage then run out with the manager
Fuck it, gotta have my paper, fortune and fame
Lay it down so the bitches won't forget my name!
{*GUN FIRES*} Listen close motherfucker
If you don't meet my demands, this nigga gon' suffer
This ain't no fucking game, and ain't none of this funny
If you want this nigga to live, then gimme your company!

[Hook]

[Intro]
(Mystikal saying "Beware" played backwards)

[Verse: 1]
BEWARE!
The man with the braids done walked in
Mild mannered like Clark Kent
I'm rougher and tougher than dead shark skin
This man gonna be have you flippin' like the blades of a propeller
Evil like Cruella
Five years later I'ma still be hard as a armadillo
Roll like a eighteen wheeler
Shinin' like the slipper of Cinderella
And bad weather
And a capella
This fella
Top seller
Gon' be that way til' I'm old as Mandela
Still gettin' better
Writin' rhymes under pressure
I'm the aggressor, I'm the professor
I'm the nigga that keep his picture on your girlfriend's dresser
Now really
Tell me what you muthafuckas know about gettin' rowdy
Turn your whole Sunday day cloudy
Bitch, I been 'bout it
Now, I kick the rest of you into HASH
Bow, Grasshopper
Bow, to the man

[Chorus]

[Verse: 2]
I bet'cha, bet'cha I'm best that I'm better
Letter for letter
Swift as a jet or keep up with the pacesetter
Sparkle like glitter, hard-hitter, hoe go-getter
Side-stepping from no nigga
Whenever you bitches decide you gonna get too big for your britches
Leavin' you stitches
Diggin' in ditches
Sufferin' hickeys, cuts, scrapes, bruises, welts
Don't fuck with the rhymin' black belt
Watch yaself
Boom! Here I go!
Boom! Boom! I know
Y'all niggas can't fuck with the man with two tongues, cuz that's the way I flow
Cuz I can get hot like fire
And you can't put it out, it's like tip-toein' on top of barbed wire
For instance, persistance
No resistance, stay your distance
Is vital to your existance
You leave it to me to show you the way out
I'm never gonna play ya
I'll take your old lady
Even if I took my braids out

[Chorus]

[Verse: 3]
And I'm uh, ready, and it looks like all you bitches are rusty
Y'all can't buss me, don't cuss me
Hit'cha, so much muthafuckin' we gone leave this bitch musty
You disgust me, trust me
When Mystikal hits the door
You bitches be screamin' to touch me
I'm the invisible man you can't see me
I'm like an illusion and confusion
I'm abusin', your conclusion, and contusions, from the bruises
Issuin' these muthafuckas with the style that them bitches want
Five-foot-eleven, screamin' and yellin'
I say fuck, shit, got damn
Bitch respect me like a reverend, and...
Congregation say "Amen"
(Amen)
I come through this muthafucka swingin' like a caveman
And just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water
(Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun)
Up jumps the shit-starter
From the rafters
The mornin' after
Since you won't bow to the man
Bow to the master!

[Chorus]

[G-Quikk]
Unh....yeah...
I got that Boot Camp Clicc in this muthafucka tonight
Me & my nigga 'Cise....
We done hooked some smooth shit up for y'all...
And we bout to throw down in this bitch, ya heard mes?

First Verse 

[G-Quikk & Mystikal]:

[G-Quikk]
I had plenty of you niggas who that I couldn't, do it

[Mystikal]
Do what?

[G-Quikk]
Grab the pen and the paper, put the fire to the blunt, time to get to it
Fuuuuuck how y'all niggas do it
She quick to pursue it til' his pockets smell like body fluid
Some niggas be walkin' up at the line
Blow job then slob on my knob, bitch I been the shit

[Mystikal]
BITCH I BEEN THE SHIT!!!!!

[G-Quikk]
Ain't nothin' you can do to me

[Mystikal]
What this muthafucka talkin' about nigga who me?

[G-Quikk]

Put a nigga on the muthafuckin' map with'cha bitch ass

[Mystikal]
Wit'cha bitch ass

[G-Quikk]
Takin' how long?

[Mystikal]
How long it took?

[G-Quikk]
It took a nigga thirteen muthafuckin' years just to make a rap song
But I'm on my winnings, in fact now niggas is jealous
Y'all niggas don't faze me
Hoes gone...hate me
Bust up and then I may get they lips bloody
Your back nutty
Aw, y'all niggas ain't ready for me
But if you want me, who clamps?
I'm shell-bound, watch me throw down on my first go-round
Here's our shit, properly did it and now you're evicted
Now admit it, fuck that yin-yang, you talkin' behind my back Mr. Hood Critics
You're all on my dick hun
Get one, lick one
Shit son, talk about me?  Jealous man, you're done
Fuck it, it's all good
I'm not that nigga, I'm not that nigga, I'm not that nigga either, understood?
Chorus 

[Mystikal & G-Quikk]

[G-Quikk]
You're all on my dick hun

[Mystikal]
Mr. Hood Critic

[G-Quikk]

Get one

[Mystikal]
Only way to keep my muthafuckin' name
Out your muthafuckin' mouth
Is to keep your muthafuckin' mouth SHUT!

(x4)

Second Verse 

[G-Quikk, Mystikal, & J-Dawg]:

[G-Quikk]
Roll like a tank
Comin' cold like a shake
Every move that I make
Be smooth like a, snake
I got what it takes to make your eyes burn
Hooked up in the jazzy fifth, with the pee-wee sideburns
I dress better than a drug dealer
Cuz when I jump shop I'm on my job nigga
20/20 couldn't see me

[Mystikal]
Who you?

[G-Quikk]
Q to the U to the I to the K, K, I be......

[J-Dawg]
Follow me now, open sesame
You niggas ain't ready for the best of me
I'm takin' you niggas nuts and givin' you bitches a hysterectomy
I'm comin' up fast, runnin' in more ass
Sharp as glass
Bitch you might think this nigga be lickin' the pussy cuz my tongue fast
Hoe, but that's a no-no
Oh, you mean you don't know?
Mr. Hood Critic told you what?  I'm lickin' pussy on the down-low?
Now if I'd did it, I'd admit it and walk around proud
But tellin' no fables, on this label, pussy eaters ain't allowed
Now I be comin' around the mountain like "Oh Susanna"

[Mystikal]
Nigga where the fuck you from?

[J-Dawg]
New Orleans, Louisiana
Home of the boot camp clicc
And now it's time for rest of you muthafuckas
To bow down and respect the South shit
Get your mouth split
That's what thing that you can do up with this chemistry
The Boot Camp Clicc is droppin' bombs on the industry

[G-Quikk]
You all on my dick, hun

[Mystikal]
Mr. Hood Critic, the only way to keep my muthafuckin' name
From out your muthafuckin' mouth
Is to keep your muthafuckin' mouth SHUT!

[G-Quikk]
G's oh, G-Quikk's a G so
Want me to creep these hoes?  I'ma keep these hoes
On they tippy-tippy toes
Shovin' that dick all in your daughter
Called a nigga, fucked a nigga
Sucked a lil' dick

[Mystikal]
BUT CAN'T GET A QUARTER!!!!!

[G-Quikk]
I'm not your everyday extraordinary busta
Another soldier out that boot camp
Bustin' you dick suckers

[Mystikal]
From walkin' round town tryin' to call Michelle
Hit slow like shit you jump now nigga

[G-Quikk]
Ain't nothin' colder, ain't nothin' cooler...
Ooh!  Don't let the smooth ice fool ya

[Mystikal]
Cuz I ain't that type of nigga to get my...

[G-Quikk]
Ass kicked

[Mystikal]
Caught 'em talkin'

[G-Quikk]
Cash hit

[Mystikal]
Cha-CHING!

[G-Quikk]
Bitch another smash hit

Chorus (2x)
Nigga you ain't shit

I woke up this morning dick rock hard
Had to piss so bad, that shit made me say Good Lord!
Dick harder than a armadillo
So I went in the bathroom and drained the lil' fellow
Flush the toilet, washed my hands
Took off my silk shirt, (what else) and silk pajama pants
I was about to meet this bitch in bout an hour (what you did?)
Brushed my, washed my face, get the soap, grab and towel and jumped my stankin' ass in the shower
Now I'm feelin' better, at least i'm smellin' better
Instead of a combination of pussy and cheddar
I still smelled like last night's fuck
So washed my lips, fingertips, but I can't forget about under the nuts
Blow my nose, wash my toes, then my asshole
Foggin up the mirrors, and wettin' up all my fuckin clothes
Ain't that a bitch?! I'm already running late
(What are you gonna do now?) Now I gotta change my outfit
Stepped to the closet and scanned the wardrobe
Seen that silk shirt, Tommy, fuck it, i'll wear that Polo though
Girbauds and Polo socks
Slipped on them Fila's cause it was too hot to bust the Timbo high tops
I looked in the mirror one last time for kicks
Like I really had to check, like I ain't know I was the shit
Everything was in place
Pearly whites, brown complextion, daily braids and that baby face
Mirror, mirror, wasup, who's the most stuck up
I bet it's that bitch I just fucked that stankin slut
Thats the thought for the day
I'm bouts to cut that ho off (why) she can't fuck anyways
Now i'm back on my mission
But before I hit the fuckin front door, gots to hit the kitchen
Cause hunger pains are gettin bigger
Man, I ain't ate shit yet (nigga you hungry?)
Dawg, hungrier than three niggas
Grits and oatmeal, no time to cook though
Fuck it i'll grab that left-over cold cut combo
And now the stomach's at ease
I'm bout the jet, but first grab the beeper, the ring, the wallet, and keys
And now i'm ready for the street
Lookin neat, smellin sweet from my teeth to my fuckin feet
I guees it's part of my job (what job nigga)
Being colder then cold, smoother then smooth, shiver then shive
So if you catch my in the club don't say shit
Sweatin a nigga like Micheal Lawrence Tyler don't pay bitch
Cause I ain't that nigga thats gonna play with ya
Or stay with ya, but i'll damn sure lay with ya
Cause i'm that type of nigga to tell a bitch that I love em quick
Better but not beleive it though (why) cause I ain't bout shit
That nigga ain't shit
That nigga ain't bout shit
That nigga ain't shit
2x

[Chorus: Insane & Mystikal]
Guns murder niggas at night

Guns murder niggas at night
Man, niggas even kill niggas at night

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
Motherfuckin murderer....shot my fuckin brother

Fuck that, I'm lockin that bolt back
Loadin that gat, here that Glock come, 

[gunshot]

Calmin my nerves, get rid of these punks and stick em in my mind
You want it?  Fine, I DONE REACHED FOR THAT NINE
I'm gone do you in
I'm tellin ya bitch you gone have to get up quick
And hit the bricks before I do you in
Two of your boys spied me comin
Them coward-hearted niggas started runnin
But not you though, you gots to play the hard role
Stop playin it up like a bone, BITCH I KNOW YOU ARE
Talkin head gonna put you on your deathbed
Just cuz you got a gat, that's just why you actin brave
Got a gat I got a GLOCK, what'cha gone do?
Handle your business, DON'T LET YOUR BUSINESS HANDLE YOU!

[Chorus: Insane & Mystikal]
Guns murder niggas at night

[Verse 2: Mystikal]
Pull your shirt down bitch
I know you got a gat, but I ain't scared bout that bullshit
It don't matter how many fuckin guns you got
The only thing that MATTER, is a nigga, to get the first shot
Cuz if I peep, that ass is fallin to the street
Bitch retreat or that ass is deeeeeeead meat
Smack your teeth, but I'ma knock you off your fuckin feet
They gone pick you up, piece-by-piece off that concrete street
When N.O. meet, who gives a fuck about a poor neat scene?
We got beef, so I'ma shoot'cha like a FAKE BITCH
Let you know just who you fuckin' with
But I ain't that type of nigga
That's liable to shoot you over no DUMB SHIT!
If I'ma pop ya, I'ma pop ya for just cause
You talk too much shit PLUS, you popped one of my boys
Gankin niggas I'm gettin downright SCANDOLOUS!!!!

[gunfire]  YOU CAN'T HANDLE THIS!!!!
So when you're out bitch, move or I won't step
Cuz if I catch'cha I'ma drill ya in your fuckin chest
I ain't gone gone ride by and pop, cause I might miss
I'ma walk up to your FACE, Pop POINT BLANK BITCH!!!
That's what you get, from out there tryin to go act bad
Not even BRUCE LEE, could whoop a bullet ass
Got'cha, come, get this ass whoopin
If you bringing them niggas with ya, that's nothin
I'm poppin' the clip in
Nigga fetcher, satisfied when you're on the stretcher
You might run but I'ma CATCH 'EM!!!!

[Chorus: Insane & Mystikal]
Guns murder niggas at night
Man, niggas even kill niggas at night
Cops murder niggas at night
I'll be fucked if I'm gonna let them bitches murder mine!
Guns murder niggas at night
Man, niggas even kill niggas at night
Cops murder niggas at night

[Verse 3: Mystikal]
(Yo nigga you caught that bitch yet?)
FUCK NO!  I ain't caught that bitch yet
I done been through every scandalous sight, and every project
But I bet'cha, when I stop, runnin behind em
Get up, pack my shit and I'll STOP, and then I'll fuckin find him
Yo dumb ass in the street
Fuck that shit, cuz I'ma catch your ass this week
Monday, a one day when you go play 

[alot of gunfire], goes the A.K
Sprayin on his ass like a roach, and if I approach, too late to duck hoe
Drop, run, fall, kick, scream, now curse
How in the fuck you gone duck a twelve round burst?
Hammin at that ass on Tuesday, put up the nine
Go get the A.K
Bitch if I catch you in the mall Wednesday
That's the day that ass fall
Then it might be Thursday, three round burst day
The day I'm blood thirsty
Fuck that, wait til FRIDAY, PAYDAY!!!!
Shoot'cha in your face and take your money, J
Now wait til the weekend, heh, yeah
Saturday, that's the day you go CREEPIN
But you better be watchin your back cuz I'm sneakin 

[door noise]
Waitin for my chance to do your ass in
I don't give a fuck if it's on Sunday
God gone have to forgive me, cuz I'ma shoot'cha in your head nigga

[Chorus: Insane & Mystikal]
Guns murder niggas at night

Guns murder niggas at night
Man, niggas even kill niggas at night
Cops murder niggas at night

[Verse 1]
I'm not really the type of nigga to play the gangsta
Cause you's probably coolin'
But straight off the motherfuckin breast
I ain't comin for no foolishness
100 volts on the mic kept knowin (????) then I'm probably chillin
Tilt that crazy off bottle 'til I'm blitzed
Fuckin yeah nigga yall know that feelin'
But I ain't that type of nigga to shoot the shit on my shit list
But I'm that talkin' bro nigga that's quick to handle my business
Im makin a run with shit that I've done
Im wavin' a gun at shit that you've brung
Make niggas get brung stoned and hung with the slip of a tongue
I unfold a truck-load as I explode
You bitches can't hold the side-door when I'm in my front-load
Im keepin'em (??) I'm keepin'em hype
I'm leavin'em right I'm even uptight
Holdin' the mic and say the word FUCK more times then Dolomite
I'm the nigga that got the last words you got served
Smokin' fat herbs and gunnin niggas down like back burs
With fast words I'm zipper I'm funky like raptors
And I'm much much more then a mouth full of adverbs and bad words
Stick it to a nig like chop sticks
(? My rapper I'm rapper ?)
More flava more flava more cooler then a tub of Kool-Aid
I'm never in doubt before so nigga then why try
Hittin' harder then Popeye slappin motherfuckers like Cha-Cha
I fuck with a capitol "F" put (?) to death (??) crowd def
And I'ma continue to flow until I come up on my last breath
So homie raise up (OH!)
Hold these tricks up (OH!)
See I'm that nigga that tells whether or not a nigga stay now look here

[Hook: Mystikal & Michelle Tyler] (x8)
I'm not that nigga
I'm not that nigga
I'm not that nigga to fuck

[Verse 2]
You been picked off
Keep fuckin wit a nigga like me get hip-tossed
Fuck fightin faggot nigga I know
He jumped your bitch ass like Kriss-Kross
And look at a riddle that I be little
When I'm a jumbo now a fiddle
I jump in your eardrum and play (?Baradiddle?)
Stop wanting to ditch'em
I'm in this bitch and comin' out rich
In case yah know 'bout a fired up son of a bitch
Inch by inch as I drench
I'm a sense clench
That bullshit that yall niggas (?) (?play of a pinch?)
I got the gimmick to make them bitches rough like they can feel me
They can't get near me cause they fear me but yall don't hear me
Just like that bitch I saw
Who hit my fucking car
Look-it-hear I'm playin that ho from (?Chipiwalk?)
Whatchu talk?
I'm very (?hard pressin?) so niggas can kick this fuckin lesson
I am fluorescent as if caressing from that fuckin crescent
A nigga that know how
Nigga that been to serve (Go Child)
Mamma that pushin shake my head just like they got a loo-ow
So come with the pussy the paper the pen and the pussy now pass me the mic
Show you around jump on yo' ass just like a (???)
I shot more shit then Shawn Kemp but got more bitches then a world pimp
And got more flavour then a brown shrimp
I'ma be comin out flossin shit that make a nigga gon' talk some shit
But if you ain't brought shit
Then I ain't the nigga to start shit with

[Hook]

You couldn't fuck the old but all of a sudden what make you think you can
Fuck wit the new shit
You stuck on stupid
I ain't that nigga to fool with
A nigga might sprout up talkin about what
The only way to keep my muthafuckin name out your muthafuckin mouth
Is keep your muthafuckin mouth shut
I don't step (?) fire then a gutter
I'm takin'em 10 at a time cause I ain't SCARED of you muthafuckers
I'm strippin'em up
I'm rippin'em up and flippin'em off
And I'mma continue to flow on rhymes then single'em out and choppin'em all up
Making classics
See massive titties and pussies and asses
But got more hoes then a value class
More vicious then BooBoo wash you up like we do
I'm blacker then Voo-Doo, harder then a rough rhyme (????)
Black like Sheep, I'm Cool like Jay in effect like Rex
I'm Grand like Pub huh, huh daddy are you?
I'm Ice like T, rock like Kim fuck it
Spice like One but got more Enemies then the Public nigga
I kick it around (?) (?choke on bread crumb?)
(?Rich'n and pitchin?) (?) to the hair drum
The bigger opponent nigga that's you
You can't compare a nigga like Mystikal to Skidrow or Ugly Kid Joe
But yet you suddenly pickin terf with me
You irkin' with me jerkin' with me when I tell your bitch to stop flirting with me
I'm giving it (?mad house like fan belt?) I came tho
I know you niggas can't fuck with me cause I can't fuck with my damn self
I'm making yall mummble (or what I thought of)
Nigga you beating me is like cuttin' a Philly grass with wire cutters I
Be keeping to you all so breakin'em off
And still uh, fuck with me you faithful walkin' around with pork chop drawers
I'm ready to graze and blaze pump up the gauge and pick up the pace
I'm more deadly then having safe sex, with a bitch with AIDS
A nigga like myself is bad for you ho tho
I fucked that bitch one time and now that ho can't hold herself
That shit be kicks and niggas be smokin' in cliques and fuckin'em tricks
I rollin' from that Big Easy
Where the buddha are beyond and niggas they rumble, over the least mumbo-jumbo
Standing tall like this Mutumbo but turn that shit to Briant Gumble
That's how we do it when we kick it back on my block
It's pop or get popped
Kill or get killed
Drop or get dropped
And nigga be wondering why they always spunnin is off of some dumb shit
Cause I ain't, cause I ain't, cause I ain't that nigga to fuck with bitch

[Hook]

[Intro]
Say, KL, we gon' lay up there and kick this bitch raw
Ya heard me?
Like some of that old Parkway shit, nigga

Microphone check (check), check one
Microphone check (check), check two
Microphone check (check), check three
Microphone check (check), check four
What y'all niggas wanna do, how y'all wanna do it?
Check, check, check one
Kick this shit raw

[Hook]
They say, that's the nigga
That's the nigga (7X)

[Verse 1]
Turn your head towards your ass and say bye bye
From the southside, southside, puff, ya ya ya
Nothin but the Fi-Yi-Yi
Eardrums snatchin champion
Chief Rhyme Buster till the day I die
I say I lie
Bitch I'll be fuckin on your grave singin ay la ba
I'm throwed off
I'm two scoops, I'm cuckoo
I crew screw your Froot Loops, poo poo in your Fubu
Yall niggas remember what happened to that mosquito
Tweety tweety MC, sweetie I'll read ya meter
Stop your water turn off your gas cut off your lights
Move you out, cut your grass, watch your kids, fuck your wife
Like a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich I'm good
Mm hmm, like syrup on the biscuit and orange juice puddin'
Come and take me by the hand and walk ya
I'm the thief in the night that slide your draws off ya
Watch where ya steppin I'm a verbal weapon
Bring more pain then when John Wayne came on old westerns
What is the actual fuckin meaning
I come in this bitch, when I leave out this bitch this bitch be leaning
It's been like that since way back
I used to rock 8 track before I rocked ADAT
Concepts going stay fat, concerts goin stay packed
Ownership's goin stay black, nigga this is payback
I scraped and scruffed and crawled until I'm established
Now I'm country club livin from the scribble scrabble in my tablet
Proper proper droppin somethin decent
Yall niggas is as fucked up as Santa Claus for Easter
I'm a keep comin as long as KLC keep drummin
And the only way to stop me is call the people for me
Fuck them people, I'll fuck over you if I have to
That's the nigga, that's that bastard

[Hook]
That's the rapper (15X)
Ghetto fabulous
That's the nigga (8X)

[Verse 2]
Who dat what they say they can't sell, boy?
They the 3rd ward huh, the 12th ward
For yall I rock all of my pauses by heart
Guitars on these boys and get down and go off
All sides get high when they ride to my words
They mine and they high when I'm live in concert
Stop what your thinking
This ain't no show 'less I'm up in it
I don't need nine or ten niggas rappin' with me
I'm independent, make frontin, stuntin suckers lose thier stomach
They lose their clout, their cool
And after I come in the cut they lose thier woman
Hello, ghetto fabulous!
Big mansions and fine fabrics
Like a man, my money and my pussy come automatic
You don't want no static with a hardcore rhyme fanatic
Full speed head addict, vocabulary acrobatic
That's him, that's that rapper
That's the man, that's the nigga
That's that bastard

[Hook]
That's the nigga(5X)

[Outro]
What is the actual fucking meaning?
(laughing)
Walking through the mind of Mystikal
No holds barred
Still don't give a fuck about ya'll

I'm still not the nigga to fuck with busta
?? the average nigga don't fuck with me
Fool a nigga in size, ain't much none of ya'll niggas can do with me
Typically speakin, i'm not what your seekin
Now vision the rhymes that I be keepin
I fuck like a mohican, ain't drunk like them demons
I'm quicker then one of those puerto ricans
Get it off your chest
Don't run on my set, i'm breakin your neck
If you gettin upset i'm breakin a sweat
Ya'll niggas ain't ready yet
I'm catching my breath, ya'll niggas ain't findin wind
I'm keepin they momma from tryin again
I done fucked up more niggas then Henikken
Fuck, i'm cute as a puppy, you smart as a guppy
Now how you gonna fuck me, that bitch get lucky she fucked me
And now that hoe can't stop thinkin of me
I'm thinkin of much wealth, come tell ya how gettin fucked felt
Ask them niggas that know me now
Even them bitches will tell you i'm somthin else
Bitches, they like my good looks
But niggas can't stand that right hook
They might look but they stay put
I done stomped more niggas than Big Foot
What I mean is i'm grand, you can't fuck with this peacan man
You don't know who i'am, you goin too fast, slow down Tito, damn
(chorus)
Nigga go ring the alarm
I came in this bitch, and i'm in the swarm
My niggas are already armed
Were turnin this bitch into Vietnam
Nigga go ring the alarm
I came in this bitch, and i'm in the swarm
My niggas are already armed
Were turnin this bitch into Desert Storm

I stick to the left like a thumb tack
I hum that to the drum track
No wives, tote no knifes
Bitch i'm sharper then a pair of Filas
See i'm humble, you fuckin 'em right, i'm makin 'em mumble
Don't stumble, hoe I ??? the seen it for your fuckin gumbo
When a homie compare me, but spare me i'm a rap figure
Please never don't dare me, bitch I barely kept an ? nigga
I run with the real niggas, they kill, they them ill niggas
You best to chill niggas
I don't fuck with them run-of-the-mill niggas
Here's what you gonna feel nigga:

Heavy pressure from both sides, as the brain collides

I'm tellin them lip lies, I hang with hip guys
I split thighs, bitch don't ask me for shit
You get nothin, no tighter then grip ?
Fuck nigga, don't bother me and try to be, and tired of me
Walkin out the hood with more bitches number then lottery
Look, I like fuckin around, but I ain't fuckin with no fuckery
Luckily, none of you niggas in here ain't cold enough to fuck with me
Fuck niggas can't touch that, no ??, get the fuck back
Fore you find yourself achin from you ass crack to your nut sack
I run these hoe brand niggas from the back of the map
To the front of China
Just when you thought it was safe to back in the water
I'm right behind ya
We as one must combine to never be stopped nann man

Novice, servants, fiendins, demons, devils
Griffins, goons, raidin rebels
Women, wizards, warlocks, witches
Punk fags like bitches
Gold, platnium, silver, copper
Any kind of pussy popper gets wopped or chopped
When Mystikal hits that door, now watch
Nigga want a big cock, get popped like Hitchcock
When I rib shot, when I hip hop, that zip lock thats thick knot
Ohh, it's goin though me, got me struttin
When E.F. Hutton talks everybody listens

Chorus 2x

[Intro: Precise]
Man, them niggas can't fuck with you, man, fuck them niggas man!

[Intro: Mystikal]
I know, I, I, I know
I know y'all niggas can't fuck with me cause I can't
Fuck with my damn self
I know, I know y'all niggas can't fuck with me I
I know y'all niggas...
Ugh, god-damn it took a nigga
Thirteen motherfucking years through this shit
Bruh, I been rappin since La-Di-Da-Di some fucking where
I know y'all niggas I know y'all niggas I know y'all niggas
Aw shit, it's on nigga

[Hook]
I'm still not that nigga to fuck with buster, bad for your ho health
I know y'all niggas can't fuck with me cause I can't fuck with my damn self
When Mystikal hits the door

[Verse 1]
See can't nobody fly, through the swamp and bayou, like I do
I know y'all niggas can't fuck with me and they can't but they try to
Some niggas just need to be warned
It's gonna be harder to get it up on a my own
Nigga go ring the alarm
Matter fact better know what it take
For the back of your head to hit that grass
Let' s get this straight from the jump
I ain't playing with your bitch ass
These outside niggas that run to the mic better come clean
Fuckin with that Saudi Arabian
Desert Storm veteran 12th ward offspring
I'm runnin these niggas to the jets
To the hills, to the back of the tracks
A-a-ask them hoes, did I do that?
I'm coming boisterous with 5 million switches
I'm the man with single and double and triple
And four five six time them bitches
I'm the nigga with the go head, fuckin' your bitch up in your bed
Standin' 5 foot 'leven dick crooked like a roach leg
Much bone and I don't fail a test
Little nigga fuck hoes both sides of the river
I can't be fucked with, you can't touch this better grab hold
Bitch I'm so cold I'm like a 24 year-old north pole!
Give a fuck about these raggly ass hoes
Grippin' my nuts as I strut in my baggy ass Girbauds
Makin em stop, (bigidabounce) pause, Like Jubilee All
I'm harder than a nigga watchin' Janet Jackson in draws!
But if ya catch me on the TV, or the radio spell it
M-Y-S-T-I-K-A-L y'all ain't ready though!

[Hook]

[Interlude: Precise]
So Mystikal, in your own words could you explain your style?

[Verse 2]
I gotta get a rhyme that can tumble through the air like a Rambo spear
See y'all can stop lookin at another nigga
Face cause bitch the man right here
You nigga didn't think that I could swing mine
Bitch I'm doing bad and saying rhymes at the same time (I ain't lying)
Talking behind my back don't make me no nevermind
Cause all you can say is I'm smarter than Einstein
I'm fire like Cayenne!
You'll never catch me cause I'm swift as a hyena
Gimme the chance I'll rock the Lakefront Arena
Like Teena Marie be rockin' Tipitina's (damn Gina)
Tall dark strong long and lean ain't nobody comin cleaner
It's all in the way I lay my game down
Watch me swing with the Guillotine, rollin' round Niggatown
But everybody think these niggas be wantin' me
To prove that I'm the man
Fuck I'm colder than a freezer, cooler than a fan
I got no love for no b-i-e-otch
Matter fact's been that way since I was wearin' osh kosh b'gosh
But yet y'all steadily trying to squab bout me
When I come in this door the only thing y'all can do is talk about me
Better get some business about yourself that's what you better do
Matter fact I'm a tell you mother fuckers three things I'm a never do
One : never gonna change my style
Two: never gonna bounce, three: never gonna bow
I'm gettin' tired of being sick and tired
Nigga you got a problem with me gettin' high
Suck big dick and die
Same rhyme phrase get me paid, they can't fade
The tan shade man with the braids
Bitches peep as I creep through the 12th ward
I done offended these niggas compare me
To niggas that gotta practice looking hard
Bitch-a won't leave me alone
But I'm not that Thug and I'm not that Ruggish but I do pack Bone
Black prince of the south that's my title
Bitch I'm whoo chka ckha ow! bad like Michael
I'm throwin rhymes at a steady flow
Whoo, there they go y'all niggas ain't ready yo

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Bitch I pimp hoes instead of an army petty shit it don't harm me
Bitch I'm entertaining like Cedric and I'm mac like Bernie
I'm black like Menace and I'm g like Slimm
I'm Sporty like T and I'm smooth like Tim
I can click just like the boot camp but I'm conscious like daughter
Bitch I'm insane but um, you still be wantin'
To claim that I'm your partner
I'm Down just like Bust plus I'm Ice just like Mike
And I'm the living lyrical miracle I'm just ice like Precise
I'm the invisible man you blind you can't see shit
You mad cause I got more bitches on my dick than bitches at Freaknik
I'm rougher than a Brillo, I'm soothing like Mylanta
And I'm kickin' like Brando, and I'm swingin' like Evander
Technics that'll speak, be sweet like my Auntie Alberta
Who got the nerve to fuck with the murderer
Better not be no busta
Kickin' it with them Uptown, levee-born hustlers
Ain't no slack in my stack, ain't no lack in my mack
I'ma put you on yo back cause you'se a rat
I'm no pussycat
I pack enough dick to make you scream Hallelujah
Runnin' these bitches from Tchoupitoulas through Pascagoula to Chattanooga
I'm the nigga gon' rock "Streamline" like Lalapalooza
You think you gon' take me, but fuck that
Bitch, I'm out that Boot Camp Click
I got my rifle and my rucksack
Never ever 

[??] could touch this lil nigga
Cise, break it down
Dave, play that fuckin' guitar
I run wit' the best and I'm willin' to bet that
He done dropped that album on that ass
But, y'all niggas ain't ready yet

[Hook]

[Mystikal]
Smoke something niggas
This one go out to all the niggas that be getting loaded
All the ladies that be getting loaded

Score it up, roll it up, blow it up
I'm bout to let you niggas know something
'fore you get mad and throw something
Bitch you better smoke something
If it's on your chest, get's rid of that mess, for the end of that stress
Nigga told me that's sess was the best, so I got's to test
It's all in the roll, fuck how you hold it
If you didn't notice that I was fucked up, y'all niggas ain't loaded
Speakin' of myself I'm just a rap writer
But before I get my nerves bad, let me go get my -- let me go get my lighter
Blaze up a swissa full of herb, shut the door, shut the window
Close the gate, get the phone out, I don't want to be disturbed
I'm on too but I'm in my own home
High as Cheech N Chong, in my own zone, smokin' homegrown
Smoke all over this motherfucker
But never would have knowed it, if I wasn't loaded
So come and take a walk with me
Get spark with me *inhales* what a brought with me
See ya'll nigga can't find this, niggas be moving in slow motion
Smokin' that  Bionic Chronic
And ain't no weed like Bo-Weed
No four like that score
I be screamin but yall know what I'm fiendin' for
Nigga you wanna know something?
Fuck the dumb shit, nigga you better smoke something
Y'all bitches... get cha mind right
Get cha get cha mind right
Get cha get cha mind right
G-get cha mind right, get cha mind right
Get cha get cha mind right, get cha mind right
Get cha get cha mind right..

[1st Verse]
I'm tryin to do my thang like a rap star
Tryin to stay clean, make my ends, and avoid the game but it's hard
Cause I can ball dope and get paid like a motherfucker
Gotta be another way to pay T. Tucker
Used to roll twenties by the ounce (ounce)
But poppa got a brand new mag it's called BOUNCE
Crackers wanna label me a nigga man, but I'm a bigger man
I'll say, "Fuck David Duke I'm the Trigger Man!"
It's the new Southern train goin round
I started in the St. Thomas, then it moved to Gulf Town
Saturday night was the time but - where your gat?
Niggas get WILD when they hear :Where-dey-at? Where-dey-at?"
You bitches tryin to pussy-pop
Me and Herb slang tapes ten dollars a WOP
I got the tape that you NEED, the tape that you WANT
Slangin tapes out the CLUB and tapes out the TRUNK
When them Trigger Man be a story
Take it to the St. Thomas rock another block party
DJ Irv had that shit bumpin
T.T. Tucker had the 10th Ward JUMPIN!!
The whole project full of hoes
(Come on - go T.T., go T.T., go!)
But if a nigga jumps stupid I'm blast ya
Who put the fuckin thing together?
ME! That's ME! That's who!!
I told you don't fuck with me

[Chorus: repeat 3X]
Neva gon' bounce, neva, neva gon' bounce
(Never.... say never)

[2nd Verse]
Oooh, see I'm the one that they talkin bout
Drop a little red tape in the store and it sold
And my pocket got swoll from the shows
I bought a little more gold and fucked a lotta more HOES!
All them bitches know whazzup (how dey know how dey know?)
Shit, they heard me on the radio, boot up or shut up
"Where-dey-at?" hittin dead home
If it wasn't bumpin in your ride it was bumpin in your headphones
No it ain't goin to my had cause I ain't gon' let it
Damn it feel good gettin sweated, hehehehe
Uptown, downtown, cross the river
Don't matter I'm the nigga, the nigga nigga, the nigga nigga
One brick object (What happened?)
Couldn't keep my motherfuckin ass out that project
Shit, that's when it happened (What up?)
5-0 busted in there was a raid and I was captured

[1st Bridge]
Alright, all you niggas on the floor right now!
DOWN!  Get out the way!
Ay man, why you fuckin wit me?
I'm the fuckin boss, I put this shit together!
I tol' you that {*punch*} shut the fuck up!
I don't give a fuck who you are get your ass on the floor!

[Chorus]

[3rd Verse]
Man calm down, calm down
Yo T.T. don't trip (f'real)
Cause when them laws let you loose, boy we gon' handle this
See you gon' get your shot at limelight
But in the meantime in between time keep your mind right
(But man they said that I was wanted) For what?
(Narcotics, homicide, shopliftin warrant!
So much shit I can't finish.)
This call concludes this minute {*dial tone*}
(Hello? Hello?
BITCH! You gon' hang up on MEEEEE??!!!!!)

Alright (*repeat 21X*)

[Chorus]

Shake that ass, never gonna....

[Mystikal]
Listen!...Listen!...huh...Listen!

God forgive me but you can't do shit no mo'
The water ain't no good, the grass don't grow
Never mention schools ain't safe no mo'
Killing in the 1st grade six years old
Ask yo self this, In what kind of world is that to raise yo children
Then again it really don't matter, where you gone go
You still gotta live it
Let's face reality, stop talking bout peace that's a thing of the past
But then again that's a bald face lie
Cause a few years ago you was hanging my ass
??? no presidents, sometimes the whole world just pressed up against me
Think about it, young black man, come up set up for penitentary
Do the math, all on you, choose yo path,be a leader, pray for strength
Know when to cap and when to blast
Get back on track, we damn near got past crack, then every dope dealer got
Snatched back
But we already black on black, that's sad
Is it really in our nature what make it so bad
But I ain't no better then the rest of ya'll
Plus I came up in a house wit out no dad
I knew that you left, you didn't won't to
But that how it is, Lord help us, You know what we going through
Hook:

It's bigger than us, it's out of my hands
That's why I'm praying to God
Oh heavenly father, keep my head above the water
It's your world, but we yo children yo son's and yo daughters
We struggling trying to get it together
But some of us ain't gonna see tommorrow...some of us ain't gonna see
Tommorrow
I know some of us ain't gonna see tommorrow

[Mystikal]
Somebody tell me what you get in a relationship
With nothing but silence, silence
We ain't married so we can't get divorced
So the only thing left is domesticated violence
When a man uses a woman to take out his problems
He abuses that woman, then man must recognize this and stop it
We got two kids and you pregnant again so how can we profit
That's BULLSHIT! That ain't no reason to pull her arm out the socket
Baby I'm so sorry, you know that I luv you and didn't wanna hurt you
When I put my hands on ya, I was wrong so I don't deserve ya
I never thought I'd see the day
I'd be a witness when they describe a nigga on the t.v
Now my sister flipping in the grave
Cause that's a how she died and I know this can't be me
Lord help her forgive me, God give me my purpose
Jesus break this chains, you know this a viscous circle
But I got my trust in you
I know there will be light at the end of the tunnel
I done been in many situations, she was there each and everyone of 'em
Keep me humble
I wanna take time out write down and thank ya, thank ya
Trying to make it wit out you is something we can't do
Hook:

It's bigger than us, it's out of my hands
That's why I'm praying to God
Oh heavenly father, keep my head above the water
It's your world, but we yo children yo son's and yo daughters
We struggling trying to get us together
But some of us ain't gonna see tommorrow...some of us ain't gonna see
Tommorrow
I know some of us ain't gonna see tommorrow

[Mystikal]
Lord tell them you difference
Between having eternal life or forever burn, burn
Lord tell em you was wit me when I had my accident
And my truck started flipping and turnin'
When it felt like I was dying from the moment of impact
We rolled ten times
I was driving my best, that fool came on my side of the line
But when the truck did finally stop moving I was just fine
My little brother that was on the passenger must of got hurt
Cause he was unconscious
We done had our tradegy's
We was just talking so this can't be happenin'
But before I could say anything else
I saw the helicopter and the ambulance
My little brother came back through, first thing he said was
"What is going on"
But the next thing he said was
"Watch over me lord and keep me strong"
And right then and there, I knew every thing was gone be alright
But we ain't promised nothing
So thank you my lord for saving his life
Hook: 2x until fade

It's bigger than us, it's out of my hands
That's why I'm praying to God
Oh heavenly father, keep my head above the water
It's your world, but we yo children yo son's and yo daughters
We struggling trying to get it together
But some of us ain't gonna see tommorrow...some of us ain't gonna see
Tommorrow
I know some of us ain't gonna see tommorrow

[Intro]
Test one
One, two, test, motherfucker
Mic check, one, two (Rrr)
Roof
Fuck a bitch, beat my ass, hoe, damn
Just- just checkin' my shit
I gotta check my shit to make sure my shit tight
That's how I do my shit, nigga
You know?
Do your shit how you do your shit
It's cool, I ain't trippin', you heard?
I'ma do mine
Don't fuck, don't fuck wit' the braids
You can't fuck, you can't fuck wit' the braids
Don't fuck, don't fuck wit' the braids
You can't fuck, you can't fuck wit' the braids

[Verse 1]
You can't stop me, cocky
Just watch me, watch me
Ain't gon' be no carbon copies
Drop it, can't mock me, too sloppy, now stop it
You should've known better, or is it cause I flow better, they kept me in the shade
But now I'm back, motherfucker, it's the nigga with the cannon for the tooth swingin' with the braids

[Chorus]
Don't fuck, don't fuck wit' the braids
They can't fuck, they can't fuck wit' the braids
Don't fuck, don't fuck wit' the braids
They can't fuck, they can't fuck wit' the braids
Roof, roof, roof, braids
Roof, roof, roof, braids

[Verse 2]
Right before the dope man, I don't sing but my rhymes gon' bang
Make the ink on the page catch flame and it light like propane
No sweat, no blood, no pain, no gain
No card, no deal, no dice, no game, no thang
Giving these bitches something vicious
I got them falling to pieces like porcelain dishes
I'm dirty, I get all the way down on the ground wit' the work
Memorize, take a picture, write a book, I don't give a fuck
I learned to fly, ground rip up
I'm here, lay down and give up
Nigga, you ain't gonna leave me out my entrance, 

[?] inches
Count a hundred thousand pennies, every sentence
Buddatt, buddatt, buddatt, get back
I get very scary like a gat in this bitch, what's happening
I rip racks and pop TECs
I'm so poppin' they just got to rap what I spray
Sometimes I gotta watch what I say
I'm so wild, cause I'm from 'round where the crocodiles play
Don't play wit' me now or later
I make you say, "Aww, give it to me, don't be that way"
I'm tellin' ya, couldn't tell you wit' the mute
I been doing this shit, how to train 'em, how to use 'em
Just apply the proper respect
I'm tactically selective with the maximum effect
But eclectic, brown perfected
It just don't get no colder, bitch, if I'm perfected
Y'all niggas couldn't pop a rubberband
You fucking with the man wit' the braids

[Chorus]
Wit' the braids
Don't fuck, don't fuck wit' the braids
They can't fuck, they can't fuck wit' the braids
Don't fuck, don't fuck wit' the braids
They can't fuck, they can't fuck wit' the braids
Roof, roof, roof, wit' the braids
Roof, roof, roof, swing the braids

[Verse 3]
Big spark create a fire, goddamn it
Get into it, get off; get down, get cross, get tied
For my Million and my Mychelle
My Mama and my brother and my nephew and myself
The man upstairs, cause I kept it up
For my niggas, and my rounds, back down
Bout to step it up (step it up)
Put in some cash and some Outkast beats
Hop behind the wheel and come out from the fucking backseat
Michael Tyler, rhyme and droating driver, miracle rip plyer
The fasthold desire! On fire, reach a flyer, ain't nobody lie
Starting them out of a team, city of Seam
With 100 suckers and a busta
And I'm still clean! Hollering hi-ya
Right before I chop you in your throat
Another rapper say I'm on my way
To get the fucking hat and coat, and hit the motherfucking door
You can't stop me! How then
Just watch me, watch me
Ain't gonna be no calling Congress
You can't drop me, you can't block me, who stop me
It's outside, you should've known better
Is it cause I flow better, they kept me in the shade
But now I'm back motherfuckers
The nigga with the cannon for the two
Swinging with the braids

[Hook]

Mystikal
What's up my nigga
It's Da Brat-tat-tat
Lettin' the whole motherfuckin' world

If you don't like what my nigga Mystikal do
Come see 'bout that shit
Step to it, know what I'm sayin'
You don't like what the fuck I do, step to me
We 'gone see about your motherfuckin' ass, nigga
Huh, uh, uh

[Da Brat]
If I do somethin' you don't like
Come and see about it
You wanna box, get'cha dukes up, I'ma be 'bout it
And ride off into the sunset
With the windows down, feet out it
I got a foul mouth, I blow weed out it
Seperate these thighs, get the price and eat out it
Ain't no other bitch rowdy like me
S-O, S-O, D-E-F, you C.K
Y'all bitch ass niggas disbehave me since the first day
Worst way to kill 'em is hit the top of the charts
First week at number one, R&B be a war
Leave ya fake-ass manager home
And if you eager nigga, to see about me, come along
I keep my enemies a far, don't need a friendly to leave
I make at least twenty-five just to breathe on the beat
Tell me, how many niggas wanna fuck this bitch named Brat
60644 is where I'm at, come see

[Hook: Mystikal & Da Brat] 2x
You don't like!
Come and see about me
You gotta problem!
Come and see about me
You hurry up and come!
Come and see about me
What's up whodi!
Come and see about me

[Petey Pablo]
(Who-a dat?) The burnin man (The burnin man?)
Yeah, came here to burn some ass
You don't see the burnin' man
You don't see the blazin' hands
You don't see 'em when I walk past
(All smokin' in Hell)
The So So, Da Brat brought
Petey Pab and Mystikal
Not nan' one of y'all
Can fuck with these bulldogs
Known for breakin' the law, just came home
Get it on 'bout this damn microphone
Who the best, who said this and who said that
Here go three of the best on this God damn track
And you can believe that
Willing to bet my Jive check
If you don't rewind this back
Somethin' wrong with deck
I'ma can't forget spinnin off the wall type shit
And no it didn't, I'm talkin' 'bout y'all type shit
Greensboro to Cuira, Chapel Hill type shit
Better send them folks to check for this
Cause I'm the one that ill
Hook 2x

[Mystikal]
This one is from your majesty, his lordship, your excellency
Bitch barely can see me - definitely can't stand next to me
Dick get hard like Rottweiler (you can handle it..)
You know that fool can break down hits on shit, get adrenaline spannin
We gon' kill 'em in New Orleans, like kill 'em for jumb'
As cold as the Arctic, recorded in Georgia (rouff, rouff)
Ninety proof through the roof, y'all niggas pink lemonade
I hit the booth, your whole crew burst be kinda late
Such a bunch of fuckin' cowards
Ain't worth the dirt that come off my ass
You go down the drain when I take my shower
New Expedition be a Eddie Bauer
Sometimes I gotta comb these fuckin' rappers hair, fix they collar
Wanna be like me, we can take your bitch, and smack that daughter
Be a man, and tell them bitches what you causin'
I'm a south cowboy, Howddyyyy!
Call them creepers, come and see about me

Hook 2x

[Mystikal]
I come from out that Cajun, I'm stayin ragin, keep it blazin
Bitch I'm crazy, half man, half amazin'
Half way up the charts, and bitch I'm halfway in your ass
I'm only halfway with this rhyme, and got half y'all mad
Soon as I come in this bitch
You know I'm comin to spit you somthin
Then Michael Parker said "That's a bad rappin motherfucker!"
I'll bust your ass up like a
Mutherfuckin' bug stuck on the windshield wiper, walkin'
Catch a temper-tantrum, from Mr. Shit-Talker
The vulgar, the champion'll knock ya show off!
I'll cut 'cha like a Newport, with no gauze (oh don't)
Bitch I'm stupid like I lost a few marbles
Still balkin, still tossin 'em
Still holdin' MC's hand
Takin' they ass across the street walkin'
So let me know when you ready to bust
With your head on the pavement
Bring ya ass, you don't need no fuckin' invitation

[Mystikal & Da Brat]
Come and see about me
Come and see about me, nigga
Come and see about me
Come and see about me

Hook 2x

Come and see about me

Chorus: Mystikal

Mystikal......
Left, your left
Left, your left, dress it right
Left your left, cover down soldier

Mark time march
Company! (Left!)
Atten---hut!

[Mystikal]
It's strictly representation of the Boot Camp Clicc
Got to find, got you runnin that train!
The M-16, A2, the nine millimeter Beretta, aim!
You better be dressed for wet weather soldier
I get cold as North Dakota
I'ma do whatever whenever to run yo muthafuckin' ass
Back to the border, rock and roll ya'
I control ya' I can hold ya' lock and load
Thirty round clip, flesh gon' rip
Ain't shit a tourniquet can fix, the booby trap is tripped
I drop P's and 203's on you MC's
Rank done hit the room, stand at ease
In danger, but in the Ranger I drank King Cobra's
Out my canteen and smoked Optimos
In the gas chamber, violent, move silent
Five meter interval, single file column
You in my sights you gonna die
You on it tight keep yo head down, eyes right
All you dying on the battlefield struggling for survival
I hope you got your bible
Bitch, I got my rifle
Chorus

[Black Menace]
I feel like no nigga alive can take me
Handle my business I'm in this to win this
You fuck with the Menace and you will be tasting my tennis
And when I get finished you be needing a dentist
I'm ready to end this niggas defenseless when I be laying that shit down
Hold up, where the fuck you going? Nah nigga don't quit now
Reachin' up under your shirt like you got a strap but you ain't using shit!
Fuck pullin' out guns I'ma start drowning niggas
Like Susan Smith cause youz the bitch making me believe
You other than a Bitchcock
It's drama time and I'm playin' the role of a black Alfred Hitchcock
B double O-T C-A-M-P better be known
Where the best lay now what the fuck that camp like
(it's for life ess-say)
I got my Glock locked the fuck down
And I'm still gonna be pullin' a plug
Much love to my niggas that's full of the bud, G-Slimm what up, cuz?
I buzzed off the suds partna' I does what I want to
You tink your pretty C-A-T smart don't you
That first step's a loo-loo and I'm too through
So chill bailin' straight from the five-oh-four
So slow your roll and recognize the real
Chorus

[Mystikal and Black Menace]
It's a long way from home, can't escape the killin'
Feel ready to kill casket feel for real
Twistin' the night away AK's the weapon
Step into the darkness this nigga be heartless
With the steel feel me as I duck your guts upon a corner
Down for the funk smell the aroma death I'm on ya
Erase your blood stains ghetto train like a pit
Survival kit marks the beast nigga triple six
Minus one up out the chamber, endangered species
Be me when I'm in anger rearrange your structure
Bustin' at you bustas USA to Russia
Fuck you never trusta' Bitch I'm out that boot camp!

Chorus

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
Go tell the DJ to put my shit on

Taking they shirt off, showing they tattoos, screaming and hollering and all
Got the gift to come up with it, put it together, deliver, make 'em feel it, bitch, I been on
Sharp like you pulled me out the pencil sharpener
Bad like that student in the principal office
Put rappers in coffins, they dive like dolphins
I'm the damnedest, the lyrical marvel you don't come across often, so
Watch yourself
Or fuck around and get beside yourself, I know
Go 'head though, bounce them titties
Shake that ass, drop that pussy, but stay in line, ho
Fuck a can't, 'cause you can-can
Cocked up, head down, pussy popping doin' a handstand
Leave that pussy smoking (Ooh)
If you wanna do somethin', then bend over and bust that pussy open (Damn, ooh)

[Chorus: Nivea & Mystikal]
Been so long (Get up)

You looking good, mama, why, psh what's up, homie?
Sirens, limousines and the club owner, ya bitch, you
If you late, ain't no getting in this bitch 'cause it's filling up
Inside packed from the floor to the ceiling up
The building ain't big enough
I'm backstage bouncing, adrenaline building up
The pussy cutter, did I stutter?
The heart flutter, make your woman drawers melt like butter
Go down like Nelly, I'm hype like Belly
The rhyme seller, kick ass like Jim Kelly
Stand up, wild out, boot up and frown
Tell a nigga if he wanna try it then, bitch, come on down
No sweat, no blood, no tears
And if I tell you it's the shit, then bitch, that's what it is

[Chorus: Nivea & Mystikal]
Been so long (Sing)
He's been on (Say what?)
So please, show me (Get on the floor, the nigga right here)

Huh, BOOM! Huh.. guess who it is?

Let's get ready to rumble!!

[Mystikal]
I come in this bitch to get paid to bust flow, I come for the gumbo
They know me for kickin they ass from here to El Segundo
Let's get ready to rumble!!!
Shit sparks, spit flames the coldest thing up under the sun though
Spendin your money on them niggas
You're wastin you time cause I'm the one hoe!
Smokin the blunt smoke, stay out of my bundle
I swung with the blast, I've never been matched
I hop on the track like a jump rope
I come with the guillotine to cutthroat
Holdin it down, fuckin y'all up
But the rest of them suckers be unsho'
Me?  YEAH, I'm blessed - if you don't know
Pack a big boner, heavy strutured AND hung low
Wrecking-ball nuts and dick touch the flo'
If it's on yo' chest then bitch let me know!!
I hope you don't think I'm a runnin
I know you don't think I'm scared
You must of forgot who the fuck that I am
The man with the braids - BEWARE!!
That's yo' ASS Mr. Postman
Got them niggas stompin and swingin with both hands

[Chorus 2X: Mystikal]
I rock, I roll
Tear this motherfucker up - let's get ready to rumble!
Shuttin systems down! You ready for war?
Start somethin, start fightin

Chorus 1/2 again

[Mystikal]
Bats and pipes - broken bottles, glass, and knives
Jump in the mix and don't handle yo' business
And a nigga gon' turn out yo' lights!!
You'll be gettin' yo' stupid self up
Askin' the people "Which one of y'all hit me?"
I don't know the way you went down looked like the ground was slippery
Attack 'em with sawed-offs, and niggas get throwed off
The party get called off, when niggas get sawed-offs
Go get my meat to meet and give me that raw dog
You, go get you a nasty, givin that pussy you bought off
I come with the real
I be with them niggas with booted up grills
We don't do promotional shows that shit don't pay my bills
Keep it in the ballin ballin, promoters callin
Videos jumpin off nigga this the real New Orleans!
My neck of the woods, my side of the hood my part of town
Thugs, drugs, and violence - y'all niggas is watered down
When I perform I'm that calm
And I'm the shit on the record I hit the studio and show 'em!

[Chorus]

[Mystikal]
I rock, I roll
I roll, we by hype
Knockin 'em out, throwin 'em away, keep 'em off
Takin 'em out, bustin they head, breakin 'em off!

[Chorus]

Verse 1: Mystikal & Female singer

I heat up the way coffee be
Tasty like pastry
Got mo' flavors than parsley
With 9 aunties and 2 uncles
I got a lot of cousins, so watch how you talk to me
Good ol' places, good ol' times, doing good ol' thangs
That was just the good ol' days
Most of my people still look the same
All though we deep in the numbers
Our feelings is close as a lot's, ya heard me
We originated in Louisiana way back in the 1930's
On the farm of the son of Mr. and Mrs. John and Amanda Tyler
Hooked up with they daughter
Daughter Josephine the difference do you know what I mean
She was on the cotton field
He was on the farm where the cows get killed
Then they moved off the plantation
Then ??? came in a few mo' years
First came Rosa Lee, then Lawrence "June Bug", then Ana Lee
Then Louise and Alberta, then my mama came who they call Marie
Without a breather, um, here come Mary Alice, and Linda
Po' Grandma stayed bare foot, pregnant, and off-balance

Don't worry be happy
Whatever we got we was glad that we had it
After that, here come the last three, (Who was?)
Lois, Allen, and Kathy

Chorus

Tell me where you from round? (I'm from here)
Tell me where you from round? (I'm from here)
Tell me where you from round? (I'm from right chea)

Where's ya family, mighty family
Where's ya family, mighty family (from right chea)

[repeat]
Verse 2: Mystikal

And I'm just another kid
That come from one of the children of ma'dear and papa
One of beau coup grandchildren
Representing Lawerence and Elizabeth Tyler (like who?)
And my cousin Harry, cousin Becky
My cousins Davita and Larry
Rock and Walter, and Herbert and Meekie and Tiffany
Cynthia, and Dede, and Terry
Poncho, Erica and Junior
Mimi, Debra, Petey, Cheryl and Buster
Jermaine and Fayetta
Ronald and Donald, my crazy twin cousins
Albert, Lil' Will, and Tasha, Trenette, Shirlet
Rodney and Rodneshia
Lisa, Lil' Allen and Derrick and Teddy

Tell me where you from round? (I'm from right chere)

Where's ya family?, mighty family
Where's ya family?, mighty family (from right chere)

Verse 3: Mystikal

Now that you know about my family ties
And my family history, and my family size
I done took ya back five generations and broke it down for ya
Now haven't I
From great-grandparents to grandparents
Mamas and daddies and uncles and aunties
To all of my in-laws, nanas, parrains and nephews and nieces
From maw-maws and paw-paws
Stomachs still growing so the number increases
From sisters and brothers
Baby daddies, baby mamas, great cousins and play cousins
So watch how you look at me
You never know who I'm kin to when you passing
If you ain't in ya own back yard
Better be careful 'cause we just might ask ya

Chorus

Tell me where you from round? (I'm from here)
Tell me where you from round? (I'm from here)
Tell me where you from round? (I'm from right chea)

Where's ya family?, mighty family
Where's ya family?, mighty family (from right chea)

I'm out for the big bucks and NO WHAMMIES, goddammit
You can't stand it!
Make 'em feel the impact and I ain't even in Miami
Handlin' with my man 'nem in Atlanta
And they payin' me 'cause they know I bring the kinda shit you feelin' as I'm sayin it
I'm like the NBA sore thumb
Or a pawn shop Tec 9, bitch, I'm known for jammin'
Smoke Mary, Mary, Mary
Put a mean ass flow on top of bad vocabulary
I bust through, intrude, move through distractions
Withstand hits and blows, don't lose no traction
I threw a round off flip flop flip flop back at em
If a nigga come in clown then I'm gon' get the cannon
And then get God back
Knuckle up boy, don't be no fuck boy
Me and Guillotine we run some niggas in a big truck boy
Run flat boy, run that boy
Bitch, where I'mma send you, you can't come back, boy
I bring flames to a four alarm fire
I wash him up and wring him out, now throw him in the dryer
I hit the door, I'm blowin' him like Southern band
And they always tryin' to find something to say about the brotherman
I invent 'em, flip 'em, and send 'em
Rhymes get jumped off like I pulled King Kong for ya
Guess what? This is a stick-up
Give me back my shit before I start pickin' bricks up
Garbage MCs better 'run, Forest'
Don't come this way 'cause you can't walk on this side of the yard forty
And respect me for takin' it to 'em
So expect me to lay it down and represent my neck of the woods

[Big Boi]
Yeah, like that, ha ha, ha ha, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mystikal and OutKast, ha ha

[Hook 2X: André 3000]
If it don't bump off in the club, you can't rock
If it ain't 808 in the trunk, it ain't knock
If you round our neck of the woods, you better stop
'Cause the people on the block gonna show you where to drop, ahhhh

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Call me the Heat Miser, the beat riser
The nigga that spit that street fire
Mystikal, André, and Big Boi taking 'em out of the park like Mark McGwire
Sosa, you so so, your rhymes are small like Toto
You're bitchmade like Dorothy, you belong in a sorority
I'mma call you Cocoa, or Candy
Go sing a song with Brandy
Quit rhymin' and double timin', what is you sayin', G?
I'm taking my thirteenth shot of Cuervo Gold
My style is drunken
And you know we doin' the beat big, oh hell yeah, it's gonna be bumpin'
Giving you something to beat the block with, with the cops swift
My stamina's incredible, so sucka, don't try to stop this
The D-U-N-G-E-O-N Family, merrily
Life is but a dream, I mean a nightmare 'cause it's scaring me
But I live, gotta give, one-double-O percent above the rest Yeah, Daddy Fat Sacks gon' burst, and you know that, YEAH
Yeah, know that, East Point never stop like that
All the way to Decatur

[Hook 2X: André 3000]
If it don't bump off in the club, you can't rock
If it ain't 808 in the trunk, it ain't knock
If you round our neck of the woods, you better stop
'Cause the people on the block gonna show you where to drop, ahhhh

[Verse 3: André 3000]
Hey, what's your name?
André 3000, the year to fear is already here
Must look beyond, sounds from the center of the sun
Reason for a gun, only one
Strong believer in self-preservation
(Aahhhhh, OOF!)
In the State of confused
City of forgotten fate, County of the blues
Street address Generation X Avenue
But Generation Y high to the point
That a joint won't anoint a new one
Walking in my silver boots, need a shoehorn and some church socks
What if I told you he manipulate clocks?
Stops, time rewinds, see what he finds
Then re-arrange and change things that's on your mind
Would you swallow like fine wine or peanut butter?
Would you holler that I'm lying and ask another?
Or pay no heed and run for cover?

[Hook 3X: André 3000]
If it don't bump off in the club, you can't rock
If it ain't 808 in the trunk, it ain't knock
If you round our neck of the woods, you better stop
'Cause the people on the block gonna show you where to drop, ahhhh

Yo' ace boom coon in the hole in the clutch
In the pocket on the field, without gettin touched!!!!

[Hook x2]
Uh oh here I come, here I go,uh oh, jump round jump!!!
Watcha wanna do?!

Let me know girl, jump, jump!!!

[Verse 2: Mystikal]
You get tackled by the style I'm usin
I got all of my adversaries cruisin for a brusin with contusions
Cuts and lacerations, broken bones, and open sores
Ripped spleens, sprained ankles, and broken nose
I'mma bust the microphones I rip on
I step on the stage and get my grip on
That's when you get stiff armed
It's on and I'm the shit homes!!!!
I fucked around and lost count of bitches I put the dick on
My alter-ego and its cool when I talk to P
They fuckin call me the home-town hero
I'm the center of attention, topic of the discussion
It's understood they already know without me sayin nothin
It's been like that since these niggas been down here wearin badges
I'm off the heezy, I'm the reason for this pimp rap!!
So stuck on myself sometimes it's like I ain't got no mind
I say fuck it dawg and go for the crowd like the goal line!!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mystikal]
Nigga you just like ten yards, always the first down

Bitch that was my only sister, YOU CAN'T JUST KILL HER!!!
DON'T THAT FUCK WITH YOU???   CAN'T YOU FEEL HER?
THAT'S WHAT THE FUCK SHE GET FOR GIVIN' YOU HER REAL LOVE????
I tried to play cool, and mind my business, and stay out it
I was supposed to be all in, when it comes to your family SHARE YOUR
PROBLEMS!!!!
I just wish I would've knew then what I know now

Noooooooow, why?
Would you come to my house, tell the truth

BITCH!!!!!  MY GOD DAMN SISTER USED TO CALL YOU MAMA!!!!!
AND THIS IS HOW YOU HONOR HER???????
I'm furious, and to her I say MURDERER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Her loyalty, and her love, YOU DESERTED HER!!!!!!!!!!!!
Changed the whole story, and got on the evening news and shined

Now who the fuck you think you foolin'?  Or convincin'?
IT MUST BE YOUR FUCKIN' SELF!!!!!
It hurt me so bad, to avoid doin' somethin' crazy

AND SHOW YOU WHAT THE FUCK I FELT!!!!!
You disgrace me, it's a show of shame
You saw that look in my sister face, she died in PAIN!!!!
Chorus

[Third Verse]
Thou shalt not kill
Bitch I can remember finishin' the argument

Thou shalt not lie
I know what you did, I'm comin' to get'cha, YOU CANNOT LIVE!!!!!
Look, you sleep forever is the fuckin' price
Shit, a throat for a throat, a life for a life
FUCK MY FEELINGS, you owe that to my family and her son
My children auntie ain't there
Fuckin' well right I got a grudge
On your Ma, and her lawyer, and the courts
And the jurors, and the judge
Defenses, your immediate family members
I'm pissin' on it and burnin' the distict attorney
You stepped down on us
Shipped that coward out his fuckin' cell and let him skip town on us
Just like that
And I guess I'm 'sposed to let that shit go down, ha?  Just like that?
I'm makin' it happen to these actors
My screwdriver, and my telephone bar, and my black hat on backwards
Takin' your boyfriend, that's how it end
But until then, I'M LIVIN' FOR REVENGE

Y'all niggas act like ya go to job interviews
And come and try to fuck with our beans
Oh no, you don't go, go there, fool!
That nigga said what? Oh ah, hell no!!
Still hot, just thought I'll tell y'all
Bitches suckin' dick if they thought it fell off
Like a man-stare, hundred-twelve floors
When they want the fire I'm the one they'll call
Your Record Company's Stores' fallin'
I'll pick that bitch up, put it on my back and start walkin'
Hit the car, start coughin'
Shoplifter get off, I'm bustin' the dodger
I'll B&B y'all from N.O. to L.A
You ain't lookin' for me, cause you know me by my face

(Chorus: Mystikal)
Somebody said that you were lookin' for me

I better go complete, tie to put together rap DEAD on the beat
Don't beg for my weed, don't step on my feet (step on my feet)
Don't pull out my prenium, messin' with my trailor
Lookin' my women, don't fuck with my jeep
My coban motherfuckers, can never be chuckin' no beef
Y'all niggas still can't fuck wit' me and would not compete
I'm out the box, off the HEAT!!
Proper prop-lock up blocks with much shit, drop shit
Jaws and break bones with my shit-song
And it's on with rhyme-stones, styles gon' be shown
And I'm known, bring it home, an' home on microphone
It don't say my name on it, so, cause they know I'll be comin' for 'em

(Chorus: Mystikal)

Attack'em with sawed-offs, suckas get throwed off
The party get called off, when suckas get sawed-offs
I go give her my meat to meet and give it to her raw dog
You, go get the

We don't do promotions and shows that stuff don't pay my bills
Keep it in the ballin' ballin', promoters callin'
Videos jumpin' off sucka this the real New Orleans
My neck of the woods, my side of the hood my part of town
Thugs, drugs, and violence - y'alls is watered down
When I perform I'm that calm
And I'm the BOOM on the record I hit the studio and show'em
All right yeah you right start fightin'
Get it right keep it right we be hype
Knockin 'em down, throwin 'em away, hittin 'em hard
Takin 'em out, bustin' they head breakin 'em off

Go wit'cha flow go, just don't call me bitch OK?
BACK OFF, BACK OFF!! Mind your business

(Chorus: Mystikal)
I'm throwed off (huh), I'm throwed off
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off

Niggas be testin' the street like dick-birds

Then I fuck my eyes and spit in my face - they got bad nerves
I smoke - funny - ain't lust and use bad words
But I'm in another revolution - motherfucker seem with his ASS HEARD!!
If you ever in your car and you play my game, throw the password
Cause it doesn't rest its head with an exquisite hand and they BLAST FIRST!!

They won't stay over my GRASS - fur, I ain't right

(Mystikal)
Hickery-dickery-dock - get 'em - jump off my cock
Bitch - get out my face and whore - stay out my pocket, that's right
Everytime I come in the kitchen, put two in the kitchen
Gettin' fat, eatin' all the fuckin' food up but ain't washin' the dishes
The FUCK YOU MEAN do I have somethin' else to drink?
You just got through emptyin' the jug out the hands - its the same
THAT'S IT - gotta get the fuck out
Bitch about to schold your hand to the door
Nigga, I don't play that shit, better ask somebody
Bitch - thought you know

I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off

I had thought i heard u laughin, talkin trash

Pull it out, put it on your ass
Some of y'all niggas still got the game fucked up this year
But I ain't gonna have it

And the bitch ain't got no cabbage
Hopin somebody can tell me whats wrong with this picture

Duck and whooo! from this fuckin fool
Monkey see, monkey do nigga

And as talented and handsome, ghetto fabulous
Keep em off my back

In a minute y'all niggas dont show no love

Reach blazin temperatures
So please come wit ya sun gear
Whoop the sleeves off of muthafuckas that try to run in here

And a boot in my mouth and balled up fists
These niggas dont want my trouble
But its too late for em, gotta accept this shit
Chorus:
(Tryna sound like me)

From the moment that i slid in the door

But afta I rap bitches ain't feelin it nomore
Wanna talk that shit, betta kno what to come with
If you jump in the water
Then ya ass betta throw up before i start ballin
And if you eva fuck with what I be recording
Imma flush you down the toilet
And if you eva come at me wrong with a mike
Imma throw you in the gutter
I can't be scared these niggas
And they disrespect me cuz im from New Orleans
We dont play that shit
When these niggas and they really want me to get started
Make it painful cuz I dont think so
I be bustin til I can't
Thats what I where that tank for
Hittin with the speed of Roy Jones Jr
And the strength of Iron Mike Tyson
Triflin, exciting, well precise
And I gotta let em know that I still been right
You talk on me strong
Just cuz I'm rich dont mean that it dont sound hungry
Count if you wanna
Hope you think cuz you little I won't jump on ya
You betta remember that
When you be droppin that bullshit
You lucky I'm in a good mood right now
But I'm lettin you know how it could get
If I was the preacher
Yall niggas would run when I step off the pulpit
If I was you I'd leave me alone
Cuz bitch I ain't nothin to fool with
But if it is on ya mind
You got somethin to prove, then go head and do it
I get so vivid
I wouldn't be able to make a better picture if I could
You understand my platinum
Then fuck up my raps, semi tracks
No matter wheter kickin a verse or smokin a sack
I'll fuck over you, yea
I'm makin a habit of hurtin they head and bustin they ass
Fuckin they woman and takin they spotlight, makin em mad
Chorus & talking til fade

Been so long (sing it!) Since, he's been on

[Mystikal]
Go tell the DJ to put my hit on
I'm keepin the fellas and women a jumpin from the minute I get on
Takin they shirt off, showin they tattoos
Screamin and hollerin and all
Got the gift to come up with it
Put it together, deliver it, make them feel it, look I been on!
Sharp! Like you pulled me out the pencil sharpener
Bad! Like that student in the principal's office
Put rappers in coffins, they dive like dolphins
I'm the damndest lyrical marvel you come across often
So watch yourself!
Or mess around and get beside yourself, I know!
Go head though.. bounce 'em, shake 'em, drop that {**}
Stay in line though
Forget a cain't, because you can can
Cocked up or head down, {**} poppin on a handstand
That leave that nucca smokin
If you gon' do somethin then bend over, and bust it open

[Chorus] - 2X

[Mystikal]
Yo I hope my concert line around the corner
Parkin cars, fellas forget it, girls nuttin on her
You lookin good momma - Why? Pshh, what's up homie?
Sirens, limousines, and the club owner - ya trick you!
If you late, ain't no gettin up in heah, cause it's fillin up
Inside packed from the flo' to the ceilin up
The buildin ain't big enough!
I'm backstage bouncin adrenaline buildin up!
The nucca cutter, did I stutter?
The heart flooder, make your woman drawers melt like butter
Down like Nelly, I'm +Hype+ like "Belly"
The rhyme seller!  Take off like Jim Kelly!
Stand up, round out, boot up and frown
Tell somebody if they wanna try it then boy come on down!
No sweat, no blood, no tears
And if I tell you it's a hit then THAT'S JUST WHAT IT IS!

[Chorus] - 2X

[Mystikal]
I wanna see these fake rappers get off the mic
Get in my room, you crowd my space, they got you all in my light
Watch out mayne!
I'm rippin 'em solo, I jump from the shelf they records sell no mo'
Throw lyrical bolos, and head busts, and rhyme elbows
So get off me!  Tip-toe out slow but softly
Hurry up, you might not be able to do that shorty
{??} entertainer
The whole crowd screamin out, "DANGER! DANGER!"

[Chorus] - 2X

[Mystikal]
DANGER!
DANGER!
Get on the flo'!

I thought the last seven would have taught'cha
I'm known for remarkable feats with my points in the tape recorder
Mystikal into MC Mad Slaughter
Standin' and I dropped a couple of rhymes and they dropped the charges
I ran 'em by deep margins
How dare you try to compare a fuckin' private to a FIRST SERGEANT?
I come with more rounds than a hundred soldiers when they marchin'
I make more noise than a yard of German shepards when they BARKIN'
Spin the bin, it, will make heads split when they hear them
Shit you get flipped from this MACHINE GUN MOUTH NIGGA
My rhymin' skills be dirty if I wash'em
I keep pepper on my tongue so approach me with CAUTION!!!!
Chorus:

That's MISTER!!!!  Mr. Shit Talker
You fuck with the old
And all of a sudden what make you think you can fuck with the new shit?
That's, Mr. Shit Talker....
FOUL MOUTH SON OF A BITCH!!!!!!!
MISTER!!!!  Mr. Shit Talker
You fuck with the old
And all of a sudden what make you think you can fuck with the new shit?
That's, Mr. Shit Talker....
FOUL MOUTH SON OF A BITCH!!!!!!!

Second Verse:

I fly past ya like you're movin' backwards
You fuckin' good for nothin', no talent, non-rappin' bastard!
I can tell you outta breath, like asthma
I can see clean through ya like CASPER!!!
Done went from ordinary to spectacular
Refuse me then I'm swingin' at you bitches til' I see the platinum
And I bet it make you  mad, ha?
Well brace your fuckin' self cuz it's about to be some shit now
Bet'cha I'ma make a foot a part of ya
Since you tryin' to kick some dust up, got to make it hard for ya
Slow ya down like you drinkin' booze
Started workin' in the studio all night LIKE IT'S THE THING TO DO!!!
Opening act to main attraction
Therefore disrespect is not allowed no form or no FASHION!
Sell my album and I'm still smashin', BLASTIN'
Who the fuck that is, is what they askin'?
Chorus

Third Verse:

I talk more shit than a LIL' BIT!!!
Makin' it rough enough, y'all can sure feel it
Nigga be fussin' that bitch be feelin' faint
Just like a cheerleader I'm bout to (go, go) TO THE BANK!!!
And watch, the baddest niggas even gonna shrink
Keep them bitches out my damned face like my breath stank
Starin' at niggas like wet paint
You done ran out of gas that's why your shit don't wanna drank
You hit the charts but you can't stay up
You want a contract, but you don't weigh up
Mic-clutchin', rhyme bustin'
Ain't no fuckin' rushin', cuz I'm perfected to the percussion
Start to finish chorus to the verse
Bout to fight you niggas with FIRE so prepare yourself for the WORST!
If I tell you to take precaution then you oughtta
You ain't heard it til' you heard it from MISTER SHIT TALKER!!!!!

Chorus (2x)
Chorus: Ras Kass

I'mma do what I wanna do, when I do it
Ain't nuttin that you can do, when I'm gon' do it
Rap game recognize the game
And we came to bring the pain
I'mma do what I wanna do, when I do it
Ain't nuttin that you can do, when I'm gon' do it
Rap gane recognize the game
Mystikal, Ras Kass came to bring the pain

[Mystikal]
I got mo' anger than you got in yo' whole body in one arm
And that's a threat to Triple H, three times the harm
That's right, you face to face with a villain
Any has-been, gets harassed and gon' feel the ???
Jump off roofs, land on backs
Stomp on tongues, walk on necks, then I flex
Crackin heads, I can't get no rest
So many enemies, I don't know who to fight next - c'mon!
I'd like to see you try to explain that to my, FIST..
.. why it's in yo' forehead!
And if you really think you got what it takes
To step to the game, GO RIGHT AHEAD!
Chorus

[Ras Kass]
The ghettofabulous Rat Pack, inner city NASDAQ
Young savages, that don't know how to act
Rebels without a gat, that pin you to the mat
Got devils havin flashbacks of When Animals Attack
In a world that's assed out, after I spaz out
Mash til I cash-out, hit my coffin and blast out
(Why?) Cause real riders still do real things
I'm "The Man in the Iron Mask," break steel guillotines
Name is Rass Kass, livin Burger King style
Have it my way, all day, every day
Drink smoke lay, the game and no play
Straight out of L.A, baby - "Get in my bel-ly!"
Protein diet (??) just another Watts riot
"All the ugly people, be quiet!"
The R-A-S K-A-Double-S, yes
Snappin necks for some live effects

Chorus

[Mystikal]
I don't like you.. and when I'm here
And when I walk out (boooo) I see you don't like me too
I've got a physical ability for causin misery
You get maddest when I feed off your negativity
For every boo, I'mma leave a bruise
For every bad gesture, I'mma leave your ass messed up
Watch your mouth, you talkin loud to the hard tester
Back it up, you won't see nuttin unless I LET YA
So you can keep that in mind when I pass by
This is your big chance to say hello to the bad guy
I run with the north side, dirty aren't I..
.. cause I'm three times hellafied!
Chorus

..

Chorus
One, one, one, one, one
One, hear I go, mic check, here I go, mic check
One, one, one, one, one
That's that shit, that's that shit nigga, that's that shit
(That's that shit)
Ya'll smell that shit?
That's that shit

That's the reason the bitches be trying to get the worm out the zipper
That's the reason niggas gon' have to learn that I'm the ripper
I scrape off crumbs and turn 'em into nickels
Bounce 'em into dimes and turn 'em into flippers
And I can't come around, like you do your rhyme, cause I'm different
You can't make your shit sound like mine cause it isn't
I run whether it's top of the line, get your mind right nigga
Murder was the case cause I shine at night nigga
The man with the braids in his hair, two tounged live nigga
Let him fire nigga, I ride with five niggas
Live from the west, bring it back home
Ducked off in the Burnerville, blowing up the zone
Strollin', cutting up on my cell phone
Hundred miles per hour in the wind and I'm gone
Watch them jails find the twenty inch wheels twirls
Hoes hatin' in the back, fuck 'em girl
I stand up like a pitch, swing the big dick
Take a picture, feet stickin' like scotch tape bitch
I swear to God I'll fuck over yay yay
Have you sitting on your porch, gettin' pushed in your rocking chair
I know you hear it, I know you hear it, I know you hear it
That's that shit nigga
I know you smell it, I know you smell it, I know you smell it
That's that shit nigga
I know you feel it, I know you feel it, I know you feel it
That's that shit nigga
I know you scared, I know you scared, I know you scared

I come in the bitch to put my two cents on a two inch
I'm tearing down the fuckin' building and the blue prints, any sign of
Intrudence
Tear your ass down, make that ass look foolish
Raise your hand and talk to the teacher, no, students, students
I like to sing a about the boota and the tooters
Smoke the purple bubble gum, merge crazy blue vooda
Ya'll past tense, I'm the black prince ruler
Sharp shooter, I'm chopatula, to talula
Point black bitch, gone, gone
Full blast turning up the water all the way on
Hi, my name is, Mystikal
I handle my business, deliver my lyrics ever since I hit the door
When I come around in this muthafucka your arms fall off
You can't touch me, your jaw broke, you can't say nothing
Fuck around and let my second wind kick in
I better be makin' it sound like the booty that the dick went in
That's that shit, that's that shit nigga
Yeah, that's that shit
Yeah, that's that shit nigga
Yeah that's that shit
Yeah, that's that shit nigga
Yeah, I know you smell it, (I know you smell it)
I know you smell it, that's that shit nigga
I know you feel it, I know you feel it, I know you feel it
That's that shit nigga
I know you hear it, I know you hear it, I know you hear it
That's that shit nigga
Is you scared, is you scared, is you scared
Cause that's that shit nigga

I got that shit
That's that shit nigga
I keep that shit
I own that shit
That's my shit
Bitch, that's my shit
Uh, fucks wrong with you nigga?
Bitch
Get the fuck off

[Mystikal]
I was at the mall, and this girl passed me by
So I like her booty she said hey boy
That's when I made my move
I jammed up and jammed re-over there by the baby shoe
I said you got a chiled huh
She said yeah he live in Bogaluga out there by my momma
Give me yo' number and I hit you when I make it home
And after I take a bath I'll catch up wit'chu later on
That's exactly what I did
We went to the movies got some eatin' back to the crib
Being a man you know I'm thinkin' about hittin' somethin'
She said this you nice but this the first date you ain't gettin' nothin'
That's alright cause I respect your mind
It ain't no rush cause I'mma get you next time
We ain't got no beef, we ain't got no quarrel
You likin' me tonight, but you gone lovin' me tomorrow

[Hook: P. Williams]
I said go 'head, go 'head and move it baby
You've got 'em watchin', go 'head and do it honey
You've got 'em comin' now, you've got me watchin' baby
So don't you stop it baby, you got me so..

[Mystikal]
Must be my baby cause I seen her everyday this week
And when we made love you know we went meat to meat
I think I'm headed for a Love Jones
This one hear supposed to be a jam not a love song
Girl you got me humpin' and don't ask me what I'm doin'
Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout my pumpin'
They call her pumpkin' cause she workin' with somethin'
I call her bia' cause she carryin' my youngin'
I made her Cavalier a Navigator, and put baby momma on a Jaguar bling
I for you and me for me
She built like a stripper I don't need to cheat
And when it's late she's always inside
Under the cover behind her cuddled up wit' her
And since we met you been the love of my life
We ain't married but we call eachother husband and wife

[Hook]

[Mystikal]
We always home and all we do is laugh together
Even watchin' T.V. takin' baths together
Went through the sunny and the nasty weather
My feelin' short so I ain't have to tell ya'
And I would never try and use you
I care too much to hurt you, and need you too much to lose you
We have mo' babies than my cousin' Weebie
I'm goin' be yo' King Tut you goin' be my Nefa Teenie
Tell me what you say to that
I be coming home from work sayin' where my ol' lady at
And you come runnin' from the back room
And you know how much I love to see you when you wear a cat suit
Now give me what I want want
I say where them trishes at I took 'em by the mall mall
You make me feel like a man, cause you can't get enough
Girl you got it you got it bad

[Hook 2x]

[P. Williams] (Mystikal)
I said go 'head, (move it)

Make it a lil mo clearer for y'all

Can't walk on water or jump over buildings or nothing
But I was the first to get ya hurt and get the fuck out rapper
So pay attention to what I put on the chalkboard
I'm the start of the concrete
The lyrical lawnmower
You can say this the house I built
Off'a shit bitch fuck dat
Non filt ba'dat-tat-tat
Boom boom boom
Your Louisiana number one Zorro of the two boom
Get caught
Roll thru
Hold back
Come short
Go gold
Fall off
Fuck dat
I told ya I was coming back harder and I meant that shit
Yea I mad a couple million dollars last year
But I spent that bitch
Like martin Luther king ya'll project jealous
And ya want me killed
Like the white man from town
Got me on the scope
But I won't stand still
Cause I put the haaa-o in da hot sauce
And the jaguar with the top off
See I started it
CHORUS
Who, who, who, who, who, who
MYSTIKAL!
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
See I started it

Verse 2

And I do not like to promote violence
Or diss other artists or nothin'
But I'm faithful to gumbo
And it's killed to be killed
The game
Jack knife
Cutthroat
Let it rip
Don't hold back shit
Nigga say what ya feel, Fa eva
It's graphic and explicit
But I be rappin' up in dis bitch
That's how I do it when I kick it
And who-eva it is that complain
Only reason you got somethin' to say if I'm late
Cause I'm the only reason you came
This is for the grown folks
And if you don't like what I'm doin'
You can suck my daddy long stroke
Been crunk
Been trunk tight
Those was the school days
Gamma Phi Kappa Si
If ya stumble
They don't see ya nigga
Play it off
But if they disrespect you
Front ya
Take they head off
So this is what it's come to
Don't give a fuck
Nigga what
Nigga who
CHORUS

Verse 3

I thought I heard you talkin' shit
And you ain't got nothin' out
So nigga fuck where you come from
Nigga fuck what you talkin' 'bout
Heads rolled
Less bread
I'm talkin' my way
Some'o bitch ass nigga with somethin' to say
I' on think ya'll know how serious I be
And how real I be getting' when I be up in here kickin' dis shit
I guess I'mma have to show you

Didn't know about fronting or playing a role
Yo thought I was slick, felt harder than bricks
With my Mr. duh and my uptown kicks

[Mystikal]
Its my time to come in this bitch and put my foot down
I'm getting ready to fitting knock your mothafucking door down
Cause when Ol Dirty Bastard doing something you know its bout to go down

Watch cha waiting thru your rap fatigues
If the mc world was a minor league
See would niggas cease where it is unique
Tear itzzzz up from an old antique
Don't inspect the project, bet on you frees
Hardhead, startin that said siamese
I never like rhymes that's incomplete
Then again obsolete, shall I repeat
Its an easy street for a nigga who earn
Learn so dern and a nigga return
Add intelligent, positive messenger
Experiment negative Lucifer
I'm intelligent so excellent
Girls wanna talk to me I don't give you know hint
Will I wait a moment give you a compliment
Bitch do you think this is some sort of entertainment
Forget about that, that's just experiment
Damn a nigga blew a fuse off the things I invent
Allow myself, my fresh reducement
Better step to the left of the rap lightning
There's no replacement for my supplement
Of the new testament cause what I say is what I meant

[Hook]
Who rock this bitch

[Mystikal]
Smokin' and fuckin' is some of my habit
Fo' the grilly hand had come take up for my daddy
A shot off in the kitchen jump but didn't get married
Still I'm lovin' takin' bowp keepin' them happy
I do what it takes with the pills and the paint
Just to keep my black ass off of minimum wage
I went from stu-stutter, to shake it like a dog
I might not eat yo' pussy but I bite you on yo' drawers
It ain't my fault but go 'head tho'
I can't return the favor but mo' head ho'
I'm tappin' at them tonsels at the back of yo' throat
Snap it on wet it up let it go in slow
Ooh stroke it suck or leave it alone
Mo' dick ain't nothin' but meat and the bone
You better not let your momma hear you sing that song
Eat it up sweat it up and lil' daddy gone, gone

[Hook]

[Mystikal]
Well look at you, you flirtin' with this pimpin' ain't yo'
I seen you pstin' winkin' at me when you grabbed yo' ankle
Ah she can't sang, but g-strings hangs
And it don't take no Ricky Martin to know that she bang
Wobble that ass, and show yo' tits
Fo' a bitch to be that fine don't make no sense
Them ho's hatin' but she gettin' the money nothin'
Bouncin' off her booty but fifty's and hundred's
Ooh, flip 'em the bird if you gettin yo' serv
And then hit this fuckin' dick and kick them ho's to the curb
Look at them hips, look at them thighs
It could make a grown man temperature rise
She stoppin' traffic and she do it on purpose
Got niggas jumpin' out their car to see them bop in the circle
She makin' me hot, I'm makin' you rich
Take this fuckin' money and back up on this

[Hook]

[Mystikal]
This for my bitches in the backseat of them cars
Know how to ride a dick, and pack the gards
After she had a daquiry that's when she called me
Talkin' hot comin' from the bachelorette party
But really what happened she probably won't tell me
Now she want her pussy tapped hard knock out I'll help her
I'm supposed to be the broad ain't that some shit
So I went ahead and drove her off, ain't that a bitch
She shakin' 'er leg and makin' the bread
Ah she good with her mouth so nigga look out
She servin' them heads you heard what I said
Around and 'round she knockin' 'em down
Wherever is crackin' then that's where she be
And guess what if that's what she like then that's alright with me
Because-a, she bring it to me, in the night and the day
She supposed to have a baby from me that's what they say

[Hook 2x]

I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide
I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
I'm too hip to trip

[Mystikal]
I'm too manish to try to handle (that's right!)
I'm too bad and too loaded for you to hold it (Oooo!)
Too tight to out-write (yeah!), too strong to out-song, too much to out-bust (out-bust!)
Loud talk shit and cuss
Foul-dog rimp and buck wild talk spit  and crush
Bring paper towels and toilet tissue, start your engine set the table
Clean your plate and wash the dishes
Can I please get a Source cover?!
And if they don't give me my Grammy, feel so sorry for your mother
And after I'm goin' get Jive
I done bust my ass, y'all ain't do y'all job

[Hook 2x]
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga I'm too def to lose a step, too jive to slip or slide
I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga I'm too def to move a step, too shy to slip or slide
I'm too hard to fall apart, I'm too cold to get old
I'm too hip to trip

[Intro]

Because this the first time you ever heard some shit like this nigga
I'm tellin you this shit so off the fucking hook bro
Ya'll man look check this shit out

{Humming in Background} + {"Waaaaaa" in Background}

Mystikal: Mystikal and Juvenile Nigga
Say Juvey they don't believe you did the beat bro

Juvenile: What you mean nigga, fuckin right I did this beat
Mystikal: I tried to tell them niggas bro

[Mystikal]
I come with my own look, my own sound, my own style
Who the fuck you think drawed this crowd
It's the ripper, the clean up hitter
You bitter intimidating young long dick nigga
Now suck it, now suck it, while you around here playa hating
Your woman around here screaming Fuck Me, Fuck Me
Tell me something, don't I put down on my albums
Motherfucka nobody ever told you I was hard as a NFL Helmet
I write 'em, land 'em, plant 'em BAM Nigga can't stand 'em
On top, on sight, heads up, bust 'em at random (What You Did?)
I got the vest out, put the braids back, put on the bandana (What Else You Did?)
Signed a brand new contract, shot the video in Atlanta
Don't pull me, can't hold me the beat don't move me
You know smokin, drinkin whenever I kick it with Juvey
Back on my own, back on my zone
Feelin better, lookin better
Bout to go get it and bring it back home

[Hook 2X: Juvenile]
A nigga got, got but I won't no more
Cause this time round I come to settle the score
Greedy niggas eat good, but not that long
They wind up with a stomach ache balled up in they home

[Juvenile]
You better cancel that shit, about you run this here
I ain't seen you on the charts what you done this year
Y'all thought "Project English" was the last of this shit
When I was really only given y'all half of this shit
Fuckin right I made the beat, and I wrote this rap
But a Niggas In the ghetto want to post the crack
Got two Niggas posted watching a bus with macks
Just waiting on the police and Niggas to jack
To people across the nation, thanks for being patient
Ya'll been itching for some G-Shit Huh, I know you waiting
When you cop the cd, get some Herb and Ride
Turn the bitch up real loud so you can feel my Vibe
I got a long way to go, I'm just gettin started
I'm 26 years old and I'm still retarded
I ain't talking about handicapped
I'm talking about the way I talk and Express my rap
You Feelin that

[Hook]

[Juvenile]
Anytime you say my name make sure it's some good shit
Look I'm not your eldest rapper, I stay on some hood shit
Am I hatin on Cash Money, Now Stop Playin
I respect it How it came, Now I got Game (Bling)
I'm all about U.T.P. Family and Kids
And Takin Care of business it the way that we live
I don't need a record deal just give me my props
How many muthafuckas you know keepin it hot

[Mystikal]
Believe it or not, keepin my spot locked
I got more season than the seafood out the gumbo pot
Now run your mouth and lose your slot (I'm Lowdown)
I make em feed for me like junk is fever one more rock(Tease Me)
Ain't this some shit I'm famous and rich (Huh Bro)
I got bitches I ain't even Fucked claiming my dick
If thats how it is, I guess we gone see
Is this all about that big truck and U.T.P

[Hook and Ad Libs to fade]
Redman: Yo, I need to wait
Mystikal: Tarantula, tarantula, boof!, handle yo' bidness then nigga
Redman: Mystikal waddup nigga!

I get it started for you, I get it started for you
Soon as I get'cha cause I know that you was waitin' for me

[Method Man]
Yo, yo, yo..
If school was pussy, I wouldn't miss a day
Big John Jay slay around the way, fish fillet
Taste the truth, ay' no more lies like Michel'le
Keep my kids frost like they was born in east L.A
Told yo' buy yo' weed by the ounce, twins lets bi-dounce
That shit they talkin' don't add up, I say what get down
Can't stop drop, can't flock, most of all I can't stop
Wreck my hand-cuffs and fightin' bullies in the sandbox
Method-cal, Mystikal, Oh yeah that's my man Doc'
Whoopin' she shoulders, WHA!, hit you with the lamb chop
Throw 'em up, slow 'em up, like the wic blow 'em up
Chick showin' butt, half of y'all ain't even know nuts
Cause I'm, I'm comin' dirty like duzum
Come on, like Buzz Lightyear lets get our buzz on
The ladies in the club, like "where the dollars at?"
They babies be at home like "where my momma at?"

[Hook]

[Redman]
When the twins track on, you can't talk you bark on it
Doc's yo' walf on it, sometimes get lost on it
America's Most No Time a Car woman
Timberland's and Nike Air's in the fog runnin'
We job huntin', with no I.D.'s
Plus my coke carry all the minerals I need
I'mma flow top speed, my crew fight it out
Like in-door hot beat, it's war when I bleed
Sugar come here, throw that ass in the air
I leave blood guts and, broken glass everywhere
I write with "bear" hands, but I'm a gorrilla
Broke out the zoo, with Mystikal and my nigga
Fuck y'all for wrong me, I'm inside of a Ridder
With fat chicks arguing, Who's body is bigger?
I'mma get my smoke on, I'mma get my freak on
Rims get they poke on, here's some more dope to choke on

[Mystikal]
I get it started for you, Soon as I get'cha cause
I know that you was waitin' for me, I know that you was waitin' for me
So when you come you better, have your fuckin' back cause
You know it could get ugly for me, you know it could get ugly for me
I tried to tell you but your ass didn't want to listen so bitch
Now I got to show you somethin', now I got to show you somethin'
It's capital M-Y-S-T-I-K-A-L you mother-fucker, L you mother-fuckcer
No pussy my temple band, no weed or my nerves shot, no money no concert concert
You don't get no deposit back, man these niggas can handle that
Who in the fuck is you playin' wit', playin' wit'
I'm sorry it can't change, you probably can't hang
The sounds I like James, HEY!
I rap fast and kick ass, and kiss my ass
Mystikal, Redman, Method Man, nigga Yeaaaaaah!

[Hook 2x]

(Intro 

[Master P])
What's up niggas and bitches
It's the muthafuckin kisarme
It's No Limit, Master P
Im'a introduce y'all to the muthafuckin
One of the hardest liuetenants on the tank, Mystikal
We was all born to be soldiers
See, these evil thoughts
They was scarred into our muthafuckin souls from these wars
The streets, the ghetto, the hood. The ghetto

Chorus: 

[x7]

[Master P]
Bitch, I'm a soldier!

[Mystikal]
I was born to be a soldier!

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
Ah, ATTEN-HUT!
Muthafuckas don't you move
I got what is takes to make your ass feel (?)
You don't wanna rest in this parade
No Limit soldiers throwin grenades!
Strictly, heavy artillery, calm and gunnin
I got your ground troops runnin from INCOMING!
Go, go go go, the fifty caliber
Bout to rip your (?) vest, split your capita
The niggas be marchin in the land camp
Bitch we ghetto soldiers, the streets is what made us!
No LBE's, no MRE's
But we kill our enemies, and drive humvees!
Chorus 

[x5]

[Master P]
Bitch, I'm a soldier!

[Mystikal]
I was born to be a soldier!

[Verse 2: Master P]
Born, to be, a muthafuckin soldier
The colonel don't play, I'm out that tank
Money in the bank, make niggas think
At ease when we rank, salute cause we scrap
Fools run they trap, soldiers bust caps
Fools die a million deaths, solider dies once
Put that on my gold teeth, my gat, and my blunt
Candy painted hummer, triple gold D's
We bout it, eyes hella red gone off green cause we rowdy
Battle kicked advil, niggas load they carriages
Weapons on the mayor of the cash cause I know character
I'm ready to bust keys, niggas (?)
Niggas are fuckin, slanging them trees
They gon die in New Orleans

Chorus 

[x4]

[Master P]
Bitch, I'm a soldier!

[Mystikal]
I was born to be a soldier!

[Verse 3: Silkk]
I came out the muthafuckin' womb, niggas wanna combat tank

[?]
My ghetto antics, my ghetto tactics
I smack quick, stick another gat nigga to your ass and acrobatic
Nigga what? Black, my M-16, is black bitch
I was born to drop phat shit
Punk your ass like a sac bitch
Yeah, I keep a gat bitch (?) I react quick
Blow them soldiers, told ya, and that's it
But see, I set my shit off like a punt (Go, T, Go)
We roll, I said we roll like a muthafuckin blunt
See, don't come stunt and don't try to front
I'm Silkk the Shocker, I snatch your ass like a muthafuckin duck
I put on my camoflauge nigga, straight up my fuckin boot
Why would a muthafucka who ain't TRU laugh at old shoot
About face, salute!
Tell I'mma soldier, by the way I talk
Tell I'mma soldier, by the way I march (Right, left, left)
I was born to be a soldier!

Chorus 

[x4]

[Master P]
Bitch, I'm a soldier!

[Mystikal]
I was born to be a soldier!

[Bridge: Master P]
Born to be a motherfucking soldier!

[Verse 4: Fiend]
Bringin bags and weed
Lil Fiend live by the soldiers creed
Of broken no seed in the botton pockets of my fatigues
War fatigues, playing live chess games with the chain
(?) silhouettes at the gun range, cause I'll be bringing pain
When I'm playing survival games, that's why I sport a vest
But niggas are put to rest, but got them right tatted on my chest
I was best on my recon, started harm and dis
The war from this, is that Fiend was born from this
Scarred from this, so all the armies now go hide
Cause the crime design, was lost in a nine to five
Enemies retire, and the bigger go up, till my gun show up
No Limit soldiers, the world blow up!

Chorus 

[x3]

[Master P]
Bitch, I'm a soldier!

[Mystikal]
I was born to be a soldier!

[Verse 5: Mac]
Assassin, soldier, sniper, murderer
Son of a bitch, arsonist, house burglarer
Been there, done most before the sun rose
We changin clothes, when the po po's chase
Narrow with the bass, got them hoes all in my face
And them fake niggas hate, so I started different ways
And even when I'm dead and gone
My legacy'll live on
Tattoo me on your arm and tell niggas he got his rhyme on
Murder murder kill killin and shit that I spit
For lunatics who be feelin' this shit
Put the gat in my face, I never squeal, nigga keep it real
Pops gave me the game, about the battlefield
We attack like the Men in Black
You react, if you got a gat
I'll never die, camoflauge in my vein
I'll never change in the purple rain
My name manifest pain, I'm a soldier

Chorus 

[x8]

[Master P]
Bitch, I'm a soldier!

[Mystikal]
I was born to be a soldier!
19 nigga 7, bitch what's happenin?

Chorus:
Thirteen muthafuckin years!
I know what to do to knock your stupid ass
So bad you ain't no challenge
Thirteen muthafuckin years!
This ain't no fluke, this pure deep talent
Thirteen muthafuckin years!
I know what to do to knock your stupid ass
So bad you ain't no challenge
Thirteen muthafuckin years!

[Verse 1]
Bow, when I hold the microphone and hold it
Keepin me rappin until I hoarse and swollen
Thirteen years and rollin
I rate colder than coldest
Gettin part of this, niggas don't want no more of this
Never leave you alone in your life, nigga I'm selectin and sellin rhymes
Slap a nigga that style sound some like mine
Mad enough you screamin "It AIN'T!"
(This line whispered, can't hear)
You be pissin me off some the time, take you down one at a time
I'ma be known for fuckin over your whole album
Who want my rhyme?
Keep decling, I'ma keep climbing
Keep duckin, I'ma keep buckin
Keepin heat seekin rhymes comin to get you bitches off me
Disrespectors cow sled, (..?..)
Hard to break, if it comes that way
It took me thirteen muthafuckin years just to make a tape
But that don't mean that my rhymes one of the strongest
All I know I been tryin to make it for the fuckin longest
Fuck the side of all this, long as you done it
When I done it, gettin blunted bout to run this bitch
Takin them riders down with me, clown with me
Leave thirteen in your muthafuckin chest and you can count em
Chorus

[Verse 2]
Nigga go pass the vibe, dividin mad this year
Creative catastrophy, leave MCs in closed caskets
Hit ya like full metal jackets, cut like hatchets
Tight as ratchets, and burn like matches
Thick than amino acids, flip like gymnastics, nasty as a pissy mattress
Droppin like the temperature in December
Clippin em, tippin em, been writin raps far back as I can remember
Fulla them rocks, everybody move key
It was ghetto Djs and sucka MCs
Handle your buisness in this industry of competition
Or be at F.W. Bulls washin dishes
Bitch I was born to write million dollar rhymes
Battle in the hallways of Cohen back in 85
86, 87, 88, hooked up with Big Boy records and made my first demo tape
We dropped some real shit in the basement
I had big ol' nigga tracks, raps like pavement
To come from New Orleans made it hard to surface
That's when I got discouraged and joined the service
Pissed of and I (?) before long
I went to war and served federal time before I made it back home
No more rips in my jeans and gettin my cream
Ain't shit unlucky about my number thirteen
Chorus

[Verse 3]
I hit the bitch like BOSH! Owwwwww!
Never gon bounce could rap and doin time before I bow
How in the fuck you like me right now
Told your ass she had said I'd be on top of the pile
Cause my rap style is my hustle
I shot niggas up like Muslims
With the flex like muscle
Use a, pretty delievery cause it's most important
I form a style sharp enough to cut straight through the bones
I came from my welts, gave up my belt
I got off from Big Boy records to put my single on the shelf, now
Do I do it? Fuckin right I did it
Shoulda seen the little chir'en in the street singin I'm Not That Nigga
Size ain't nothin nigga, I'm short
Shockin nigga, raah!
They gave me five hundred dollars, shit I quit both of my jobs
Fuck em, got some other shit to do from nine to five
My birthday came, and my sister died
But next year, Mystikal signed a half a million dollar deal with Jive
This shit thats tragic can't be no more
Because of my rings I work at A&P no more
I drive my landcruiser off the show floor
Got the time to time to feel pain, sittin on Volvos
Comin with scheme, up in my dream
Who'd a ever thought I'd be a No Limit soldier
By the end of that thirteen
Thirteen manic muthfuckin years!
*Comprised of lines from many of his songs on previous albums

(Scarface voice)
Ok, ok, jou wanna fuck wit me? Come on
Who put this fuckin shit together?
ME! THAT'S WHO!

Chorus: X 4
Did I do it?
You fuckin right I did it! (Alright)
Fuckin right, fuckin right

[Verse 1]
I got's to get it when I do it
Make sure your ass feel this
Don't want nobody style, used to be
Bitch, cause I'm still it!
(In your own words could you explain your style?)
Ow owwwwwwww! Bad like who? ME THAT'S WHO!
I'm the pussy cat!
Y'all muthafuckas ain't ready!
We gonna be hung, I'm not the nigga
I'm not that nigga I'm not that nigga
But I'm the unlimited, unlimited
That's how we do it when we kick it
Bum bum bum, HERE I GO!
I can't fuck with my damn self, I-I know
Walkin through your mind, look what I brought with me
Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water
Back to the boulder
No, I serious, can't nobody find
Who put you on the fuckin map? (Me, that's who)
Ahhhhh! No, you, won't, know
Did I do that? Fuckin right I did it
Chorus

[Verse 2]
Lemme see, you lackin creativity
Tryin to bite my style like fingernails
Tryin to sound how I sound, on my tounge with every single name
(Pause, people talking)
Slow down, T don't, damn
Watch yourself, and they can't
Fire point blank to the back of (?)
Four five six time the bitches
Never exercising, you gon get to big for your britches
The man right chea!
I ain't comin here for no foolishness
Sides, not much any one of y'all niggas can do with me
Speakin like one of them Puerto Ricans
GOOD LORD!
Fuckin right I did it!

Chorus

[Intro: Mystikal]
Hey there, Sup boo?

Naw for real, come ere tho, Mmm hmmmm

[Mystikal]
You got that fire
Ain't to fly, But When I jus walked by ya
Hands at your side, Dont you know I ain't your average buya
I thought you live on the twelve-hundred block on Tecnuiqe
By tha studio apartments, right off 70 street
She said ya, How do you know that?
I said you live next door to my friend
Her name tazra
She said, Oh you know tim?
I said ya we use ta kick it man, What about it?
She said no thats cool, Thats my girl
Dont take it how it sounded
She said you mean
I said who told ya?
Me and you can make music, dats kinda what im hopin for
Movin like im automated
What we bakin?
Mixin, blendin  and twisted
Tha neighbors gonn be listenin
She said Slow down baby, movin kinda swift
Besides we just met I usually dont get down like this
I said Dont even trip I got you!
She said, You sure?
I said Yup I got to!

[Chorus]
Put tha dick on tha track, and make em sang
Put the needle to the grove x2
Them otha niggas ain't gonna do what i do!

[Mystikal]
When i hit ya with tha tenor
Say sapreno
When your moanin
We ain't gonna stop makin racket
Till in the mornin
I say baby kick it wit me all nite
Safe sex, like pot holder on my mic!
Commin thru the woofer, In your speaker
When we freakin, I can see you gettin hot
Why you weakinin? Climaxin
While im rappin
Whats my name, and who its for?
Dats what im askin
Spitin like wax
All over 64 tracks
Remember shock ta knock you sax
Symbols, and high hats
Gettin nasty with the music
To be funky like a bass line
Disregard it and get ya good sing
Ain't no red lights, When i take mine
Im havin sexual intercourse with the chorus
Screamin! hot vocals got your adlibs gettin hoarse
Sweatin the whole session, your circuits burnt
She said baby dont beat it down no more
Its just the second Verse!

[Chorus x2]

[Mystikal]
First time I laid eyes on ya I was like zaaam
Tell me, girl where you goin? whats your name?
She said Pam
And I think its only better that you know who I am
Im the man they make high, like the melophones in southern japan
The way I work my aucustics, ain't no comparin
Very rough and aggresive when i lay em
Huffin and puffin, Right when I see em
Ya breakin it down so scandalouz
She got me thinkin, when else
Im touchin ya like a massager
Ill be bustin off soon as ya touch me in
You can hear It through the soundproof booth
Fuckin up the roof!
Dont stop, she on top
And im watchin em jiggle
No more preachin and minglin
She pregnant with my singer
I dont be kissin and tellin
But its gotta be told
Now im 500 dollas short
Unless we got married, I wed till I was old
To infinite, Im plannin our future
Its jus gonn be me, you, nobody else, MIne and Mystikal Junior!

[Chorus x4, then in backround till fade]

[Outro: Mystikal]
How that feel?
Com here, Take dem headphones off
Turn around little baby
I put tha dick on the track, ya feel me
Its like when i get on the track
I have sex with it, I make out with it
We make woopie, we do the nasty
Anyone wanna jus jump on and rush it?
Im gonna spend time wit you
I ain't quitin halfway

[Intro: Master P]
It's crazy out here (uhh)
Yo, mama, I'm tryna keep my head strong (whats up Mystikal?)
Uhh! (uhh) I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it
Uhh! I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it
Uhh! This ghetto got me crazy
Mama, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhh! I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it
Mama, I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it

[Verse 1: Master P]
I feel like a bird nigga with no wings
I'm stuck in this ghetto tryna have a little change
My homies killin' up each other 'cause we gotta eat
And I ain't trippin' 'cause I'm runnin' from the police
I done seen little kids in the projects starvin'
I done seen more hoes messin' than Marvin
See in the ghetto, the sun it barely shines
But so many niggas in jail and the welfare lines
And all my life I thought Bill Clinton ran the country
'Til I found out Bill Gates had all the money
And the media startin' east and west coast wars
I'm from the south, where they prejudice on us all
Commodity powdered milk and eggs don't fill us up
But why the government sold us drugs and charges to clean us up
Gave us three halves and high interest student loans
Four dollar minimum wage and section eight, we call it home

[Chorus]
Uhh! This ghetto got me crazy
Mama, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhh! I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it
Mama, I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it
Uhh! This ghetto got me crazy
Mama, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhh! I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it
Mama, I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it

[Verse 2: Mystikal]
It's real when you can do whatever you want to do
When you want to do it
Ain't to many niggas out there livin' like that
That's why the rest of y'all niggas ain't never gone through it
How many niggas in the penn
How many niggas in the cemetery don't know why?
How many strikes y'all niggas need
How many innocent children in the ghetto gotta lose they lives?
WHY? Why you gotta make your mama cry?
HUH? She tell you stay off of the street 'cause that's where you gon' die
But you don't listen 'cause your mind is one track and your head is hard
And your gettin' flipped, and your talkin' back
Showin' your ass, actin' straight up off the wall
Lemme talk to y'all, don't think it's too hard to fall, but that's far and all
I done saw it all, and it was cool when it started off
Now the nigga's duckin' bullets like dodge-balls
Niggas got me scared to plant my seed
Fear of how it's gon' grow
Livin' in a messed up world, in a messed up time
I'm tellin' ya, you can't do shit no more
It's bigger than us, it's out of our hands
That's why I'm prayin' to God
Oh, Heavenly Father
Keep my head above the water
It's your world, but we your children
Your sons and your daughters
We strugglin', tryna get out the ghetto
They constantly tryna make it to mars

[Chorus]
Uhh! This ghetto got me crazy
Mama, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhh! I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it
Mama, I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it
Uhh! This ghetto got me crazy
Mama, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhh! I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it
Mama, I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it

[Verse 3: Silkk The Shocker]
Dear mama pray for your son
Hopin' I can make it through this game
Wishin' I can change, I've been through so much
Seen so many things, couldn't find the words to explain
Only way to avoid stress is to get high, by drinkin' Hennessy
But I can't get too high, 'cause I keep my eyes on my enemies
I've seen harder times, but there gonna be some harder days
Penitentiary close, but you know what? Cemeteries ain't that far away
Before I die I'm tryna make the whole world feel
Like our people scared to stand here
The way we express ourself, they think that we all some killers
Now look through the eyes of this ghetto child influenced by the street
Go to sleep to gunshots, wake up from sirens from the police
See now my life ain't been the same nigga
Life as a thug
If I had to draw a picture of my life
I have to paint my picture in blood
Closest homie died
Before he died little cousin told me this
Get you somethin' 'cause cemeteries
Packed full of niggas who had dreams to be rich
So keep your head up, to all my ghetto children
It was hard to tell my family one day I was gonna grow up to make millions
When I told them, they seemed to laugh at my so called dream
I liked to scream when I came home from jail
Told: my best friend turned into a fiend
I ain't gonna lie, my conscience ain't clear
When I close my eyes
But you gotta realize, God forgive me
I'm just out here, tryna survive
They cut welfare and health care
That shit gotta stop
I got a positive note, my auntie havin' a baby
Congratulations, she on rocks

[Chorus]
Uhh! This ghetto got me crazy
Mama, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhh! I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it
Mama, I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it
Uhh! This ghetto got me crazy
Mama, won't you pray for your baby?
Uhh! I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it
Mama, I'm just a ghetto child tryna make it

Fuckin with niggas like E four O and B-Legit
Y'all niggas got a pay to feed the men, we the men
Do it fast or slow, we dressed up straight from a fashion show
Passin hoes, ain't nothing on the wall
In the hall but platinum and gold
I put the dick on the track, and break they back
To the mighty N.O., came fame, when I brought it to the top
Here we go, in this B-I-T-C-H
Chorus

[Master P] (Talking with echo)

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]

Look here, you got three crazy muthafuckas
In the same place at the same time
(Yeah, Master P)
You know this shit gon be off the hook
(It's gon be the wildest shit you ever heard.)
For my bitches down south
Southern hospitality
(Representin, ya heard me!)

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
From the cold, hard streets of the LBC
To a duet with Mystikal and Master P
Real G's ship keys and shoot dice on their knees
And put pistols to the mouths, of their enemies
Old country ass nigga with a gold in the front
Be the same muthafucka that get your bitch ass stomped
Underestimatin hatin got you knocked out cold
Tryin to play my boy over, you was with your ho
Them South niggas bangin' off the shit that we write
Punk niggas get killed, straight on sight
No Limit ain't no gimmick
It's tragic you know, so don't be meddlin with my boy and my ho
Lay low, hit the floor, I'm back
Yo P, take me to the streets, that's where my heart is at
You make em say ughhhhhhh!
I make em say beeyatch
Together we can flip the script and get grip
You got the crack, I got the bud sack
Mystikal, smack, you got the strap
Deep in that gangsta shit on a night like that
You blast me, I blast you back, beeyatch!

[Hook]
We bout to jump off with some gangsta shit
Gangsta shit!
We bout to hop off with some gangsta shit
Gangsta shit!

Gangsta shit!

[Verse 2: Mystikal]
Got this fuckin party poppin'
You cappin and army braggin'
Gon keep smugglin in this game shit
"Niggas ain't rappin" what you say about gangsta rappin'
You get killed forever, my nigga, every day
Where you get fucked up nigga, is where you lay
Time again I tried to tell you, but you ain't wanna heard what I say
Damn leather dog bombin'
Done made a mistake
We made (ghrrh) sound so good
Keep that gangsta shit banging up and down your hood
Cause only real gangstas get down and to the bottom
Where y'all going, that much, we'll see right through ya
I'll out hustle ya, can't put up a fight cause I out muscle ya
My really don't give a fuck attitude got ya feelin' uncomfortable
I got that there, nigga you ain't saying shit
I'm colder than a brand new pair of Stan Smiths
Fresher than a whole box of green Altimos
But I got to blow your head off and put bullet holes in your Girbauds

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Master P]
B-O-U-T we bout it
Real gangstas live muthafuckin' rowdy
And where you from is how you come
Where you be or you're at
Fool, watch your back for these gangstas in that black from
Long Beach to New Orleans, from every nigga in the hood to the
Penitentiary
Tryna, survive on these streets
Slangin' dope cause the kids gotta eat
Put it in a car or a plane, Grey Hound or a train
Sixty five when it came, eighty nine when it lay
I'm in love with miss mo mo, candy painted four
Twenty skirt with convertible, fucking polo
Bring the stylins of your talk
I mean real gangstas don't talk
Free your mind and refugee
Alive and turn your cheeks like Pras be

[Hook]
Mothafuckin' murderer x2

Murdered my sister
The only thing ?I'm tryin to tell? is to take it to that nigga
Get that mutherfucker what I tell myself
Make that mutherfucka feel what Chell felt
Heavenly father but ?your will? to bring them tears to her eyes
Fuck the fussin and the fights why she have to die
Couldn't ?beleive my baby? to leave away from here so goddamn early
I tried to tell her that nigga was bad news but she ain't heard me
Fact was that she love this bitch
But she found love on the graveyard shift
And how many ? mutherfuckin' quick lift, or spliff, on the fifth
Find my baby sister she ain't deserve that shit
Nigga you couldn't of, nigga you wouldn't
Put your hand on a women, how could it be my sister
Can't say I wouln't miss her
But I wouln't forget cha
Get that bitch for every time he hit ya
He gone pay for what he did ya
MURDER!
Motherfuckin Murderer x3

Possesed that nigga that hurt her
100% black queen self  ?every women?
Nigga you lost your fuckin' life when you took hers from her
You took her from her brothers
And her baby mother from her
But after its said and done your ass gone burn like its summer
Even give a fuck bout a sister?
Sister was your victim
Fuck he said he didi it
What the fuck you mean your being a victim
Fuck him, I'll get 'em
Be that nigga to deal with him
Cut him and split him, reverse that feelin'
Commited ?mutherfuckin? centuries under my ceilin'
The paper said lacerations to her trachea what did the killin'
But thats on my first born to make him my first blood
Nigga you took her from her fuckin' close friends and first cous'
She would probably miss my partner she was cool with
? multiplied by the people she went to school with
Never the less, rest my sweet sister
?I'm about to? handle this buisness
Get that thing and kiss ya picture
Heavenly fatherhe done put me in that water
But I got to get theat bitch for what he did to my momma daughter
Never dreamed he'd be the one to hurt her
She died a bloody murder
MURDER!
Motherfuckin' Murderer x4

Into the tick-tock of the wee hour
Shit started to get sour
She was killed by that fuckin' coward
How could nothin' take so much and
No more was uppin' no more huggin'
But his conciense know the truth so he fucked up and
Her memories was all that was left so to that I'm clutchin'
She was taken out of your reach now you can't touch her
Unfortunatly also taken from us so we gotta sufer
?dabalin'? down to that last supper
Gotta hustle
Feelin' my album shake the devil up
Reconstruct this motherfucka
I never slowed down just throw it down like I know how
Thought I do it like she would have wanted me to do it
I still can't believe I lost her in the worst way
She died wearin' my very first T-shirt on my birthday
Now what the fuck I'm supposed to celebrate
Would have celebrated if I caufgt his ass
But I got in my ?bed? and its too late
Everybody gotta roll they must play
No hollerin' when to pray
But this mutherfucka gotta pay
There will be no reasonable excuse for what you've done
Even ignored him when he started stealin' from me
Cause them was crumbs
A raindrop to a river
Huh, a sinner to a christian
A holler to a whisper
She was the sole reason that I got along wich ya
But I'm a never heal from the scars of what you did to my sister
MURDERER!
Motherfuckin' Murderer x6
Uh oh, whutcha want whutcha gon do nigga

I know yall nigga ain't fuckin wit me, you lookin for me

If you gonna be down with me
Be all the way down with me, or get from around me
You see what I'm doin but don't like it
Even though everybody and their momma bout it bout it
Our concerts crowded, crowding used to be down but now you doubt it
You fuckin' well right
We real over here, we real on the No Limit mountain

So how the fuck is you soundin'
Nothin but legends, true multimillionaires 'round me
SoundScan be astounded

Black owned and clownin
CDs from the corner
Told yall I was gonna do it
But you didn't wanna see it
Wasn't worried about a nigga
Till I was leavin
Now, come here, let me show you the difference between a man and a ho (you the ho)
It's the man right chea (you lookin' for me)
Here I go
Whutchu want do nigga

Chastise and brutalizing, stop 'em from dissin
If I'm in it I own it, put the keys in ignition
I hope your seatbelts get fastened
I'm known for massive harassing
Havin to snatch your ass off the mic
Grab ya and slap ya
Psh come here, psh shut up
I know you ain't gonna do it no more
You sayin my name you must be lookin for me
Here I go!
Whutchu whutchu want do
Whutchu gonna do
We can do it whenever however you want to
Entrepreneur soldier guns galore
Watch em burn bitch burn like a flame thrower
Rock it all sharp as a bull's horn
Long, strong as a python, whores they get they fight on
Soon as I cut my mic on
Niggas getting humped or stumped
Fumbling mcs I crumble
Come through like the reaper
So deadly you don't wanna rumble
That's right don't panic, Mystikal the mechanic
Sank you like a torpedo gigantic as the Titanic
Rhymes I'm hummin keep hummin
I'mma keep comin
Grabbin ya woman
But the drummer still drummin
Hard hitter, bullshitter, head splitter when bitter
Assassinate a rookie killa
Like Adolph Hitler
A Mandingo warrior
Opponents get crushed
I'm too cruel to be moved
Too fuckin much to be touched
Got em danglin and janglin
To that shit when they hear this
Fight me like a Viking, bitch I'm tragic like a terrorist
You think you don't like it but I have yet to begin
You'd rather be my enemy cause I'mma deadly friend
So stay the fuck from around me do I make myself clear
Unless you lookin for the man
Cause the man right chea

[Intro: Master P]

Consider me an asset
Slow down cause I got some more rhyme ambush ya ass set
Nigga that's how it is and I'ma make sure it stay that way

[Verse 2: Mystikal]
Acceptin you can deliver title material

I'm rocked up Oh Creative valves been unclogged up
I keep my elbow in your back To keep yo ass cocked up
Ain't no fuckin wit me Ain't no fuckin wit shit I did
26 and been through it, Tellin it like it is
Comin up with tight shit To make your girlfriend love me
Hunt me like playin rugby, Been a star since smokin puffies
And I'm that type of nigga that come thru this bitch
Now I stay down like it ain't nothin, My position is not up for grabs
My title is not for uppin
Seem like I can take a little bit more that what you put out to harm me Gotta continue to line my style to take
Formin a fort (You really will) I writes em line for line
Take my time till the shit is all tight
Focusing mind For most definitive could take all night
All right Fuckin right Unlike nobody else

You know how we kick it

When underground rules, will be tha day

[Chorus till fade] (11 times)
*In case you don't know, 'It's yearn' is the same as 'it's yours'

(Intro, some guy talking)
Old school niggas. (IT'S YEARN!)
True hip hop niggas. Ha, ha. (IT'S YEARN!)
This something y'all niggas can dance to

[Verse 1]
LIKE THAT!
I be a black muthafucka from the 12th ward
I want some bullshit niggas (?) hittin em hard
I hit em with more (?) I make em run
I made a lot of noise with the shit I done
I give y'all a chance to roll but y'all niggas can't roll
Sit your ass down, let me show you how it go
I thought I showed you last time, when will you learn?
Watch what you ask for, nigga, IT'S YEARN!

[Verse 2]
The maniac brotha's back with another dramatic track
Crossin my path struck you like you a black cat
Maniac, abused, used, and abused
Try your luck and bring a pack for the horseshoes
You got nothin to lose, it just might help you out a bit
Shit, I doubt it
You're better off dead, goin head to head with a nigga like M-I-K-E
Your best bet's to pack your shit
Calm your head, bleedin bitch
Sucka tragic you'll never get none
You better leave cause you only get one
Chance to make a break for it
Uh huh, leave now or get the pow
Get the fuck out this area, I'ma have to bury ya
Mo thug, I draw blood
Whip that ass, leave ya face down in the mud
Militant, bitch I might be
But that's a risk you take when you fuck with me
Headlocked, yo I dirt ya like a nacho
Shit you go, bigger than G.I.Joe
You ain't know? I thought you knew
This time you can have it, it's for you
IT'S YEARN! X 3

[Verse 3]
Come on, come on
Well come away sucker fake MCs in the place
There's only one Mystikal so make no mistake
Comin straight in your face, sucker MCs I hate
Rhymes bite you in your ass like a rattlesnake
Bout your screamin no way
Bitch you won't escape
I'm like a boa 'strictor I kill, I suffocate
Hittin harder than Hitler, no slidin, no livin, no jivin
Got more niggas runnin and hiding than Batman and Robin
Takin out adversaries with rhymes I wrote
The sucker (?) I'm the antidote
I the conductor of shive rhymes
(...?....)
Stretch like elastic, pure fantastic
Lift off and burnin MCs like amino acid
Nigga please don't try to battle, it's suicide
Those who have time watch me I do survive
This is only a suggestion, so ask no questions
Try and digest my rhymes bitch you get indigestion
Wrote this as a lesson so you will know
Comin hard muthafuckas this physical
Be pussy bitches in my fans I brought a dime and
Understand I'm comin strong nigga harder than He-Man
With these hands, nigga laying face down on the curb
IT'S YEARN!

[Verse 4]
Some murderer got the nerve to talk about me
Bitch I never heard of ya
That's a shame, you got the blame cause you're blind
You know my name, the M to the Y, S-T-I, the K-A-L
Rebel, ya smell, ya fell, ya tell, ya sell, hotter than hell
Soft as hell, I might as well SPELL!
I'm a big marine, M-I-K-E, you figure weaker then me
I speak uniquely, how in the fuck do you plan to beat me
Ruler of hip hop, left ya shell shocked
Scare the fuck out ya like Alfred Hitchcock
Don't wanna be bothered (..?..)
I'm a rough motherfucker from the 12th ward
Never left nothin undone, breakin jaws for fun
Cocky as Paul Bunyan, have ya cryin like onion
Flyin low, a soldier born, ya chicken's choked
Explosive, bitch I'm the one that wrote this
I scream like rebel with the sword and snake
Your boss come to battle, it's not your week
I reverse my verse, I love to curse
You won't be the first muthafucker in the back of a hearse
Stomp, pop, clap, havin the last laugh
Then, I step back and grin at your dumb ass
Watch me burn, can't miss my turn
Like, do you want it?
IT'S YEARN! X 2

There we go right there, ok were on the air
Let's go

[Verse: Mystikal]
We grew up with showbusiness on our mind
In hope to make a big name
That's why me and my sister was a stiff competition
Show off when company came
Now my Lil' cousin wasn't shy see but in front of the rest of the family
Shake that ass!
Although my sister was the one with the beautiful voice
I still had to go last
Everybody waitin' on me to cut a fool so they could laugh and act goofy
I either came in the room when ain't nobody gonna see the Michael Jackson and just act stupid
But lately, me and my people ain't been havin' too many family groupin'
Or maybe, itchin' for sometimes heard a sweet melody of my baby whoopin'
You was there through the struggle
And shortcomings tryin' to reach the big picture
I'm tellin' ya
It hurt when you plan on showing somebody love and
When it's time to do it, they can't be with you
I'm feelin' guilty to tell you things been better since you been gone
Well no matter
How much you fake something and front it ain't the same when you ain't home
(Baby)
I'ma miss you forever, forget you never
But you gonna see the world through my eyes
And live what I endeavor
So, if you can see me way up in Heaven, over the clouds
You can be proud of your little brother, so look down and smile

[Chorus]
Shine my lady, I miss you baby
For your my baby, my love is crazy
You're my sister, I'll always miss you
No one can get ya', 'cause God is with ya'
Shine my lady, I miss you baby
For your my baby, my love is crazy
There's no other, it's from your brother
Your son and mother, 'cause we all love ya'

[Verse: Mystikal]
All the sad songs in the world
Probably couldn't express how much I miss my baby
I just thank God that I had a big sister
The 29 beautiful years that he gave her
Even the days when I misbehaved
And I knew she was gonna get that belt to pop me
I could see the aggravation in your face when
My momma said that they had to watch me
“Michelle, if you go somewhere, take Michael with you”
Know what that meant
All up and down I was gonna try to find out how your time gonna be spent
'Cause I was too hard-headed
Everywhere you said “Don't go”, that's where I went
Always flipping, jumping around like a jackass
Somewhere climbing a fence
Bring me my Rocking Robin, my double dutch bust
She had some songs to sing for us, we had some name brands to discuss
Plus, I want to tell her I was sorry for leaving the toilet seat up
And not cleaning out the tub, and leaving peanut butter and jelly
And drinking out the Kool-Aid jug
I pissed you off, burned you up
When you told me: “Cut that music down”, I turned it up
Bickering conflict cuss each other out is how we showed our love
You was my flesh and blood, we was brother and sister
And it meant so much
Now I'm doing it, you supposed to be here
We supposed to be writing songs together
I'm telling ya', that girl tore talent shows up
With old Tina Marie records
What you left us with, never be in vain
You gonna be shining, and they gonna know your name
Too many damn things left unexplained
But since you was an angel down here
Then an angel there you shall remain
And that's always until my time
You're my strength, you're my light
Shine

[Chorus]
Shine my lady, I miss you baby
For your my baby, my love is crazy
You're my sister, I'll always miss you
No one can get ya', 'cause God is with ya'
Shine my lady, I miss you baby
For your my baby, my love is crazy
There's no other, it's from your brother
Your son and mother, 'cause we all love ya'

Shine on, shine on
'Cause we do miss you
There's no other like you

Shine on, shine on
'Cause we do miss you, oh you

Oh yeah, oh, ohh (Oh, oh, yeah)
Oh yeah, oh (Huh-uh-uh, come on, yeah)

Oh yeah, oh, ohh (Oh, oh, yeah)
Oh yeah, o-oh-oh-oh (Huh-uh-uh, come on, yeah)

Oh yeah, oh, ohh (Oh, oh, yeah)
Oh yeah, oh (Huh-uh-uh, come on, yeah)

[Fade out]
Still Smokin Bud, Still Smokin Weed
King Edward, Philly Blunt, Swisha, keep groovin, Tampa Sweet, good ol
Optimo, easy water, joker

My lips get black and my fingertips burn and my eyes half way open
Cough Cough and I'm chokin
But bitch I'm Still Smokin!
I wanna be puffin this like I ain't be worryin bout nothin
If you gonna get the cigar
Nigga I'll do the stuffin
I roll em swoll like broken arms
But I sure hate when they come around this bitch I don't know talkin bout
What chall smokin on cause
Niggas like that we call em Hoovers
They try to get cool with ya
To smoke your weed up

Puff Puff Puff Puff Godammit!
Nigga you ain't chip in no shit here
Bitch What's Happenin!
But if you did then its good and it goin down
Get rid of them nickels and them dimes

Tenth thru 11th to the 12th ward bound
But P said one of my niggas I heard somebody say
One Time!
But I paid it no mind and I kept rollin
But that was the Po Pos
I gotta get rid of this fat ass Optimo that I'm holdin
Excellerate and I made that left on line center
I hit that bitch one more time
Then threw it out the window
Young niggas in a big white truck
You know whats up
They're lookin to catch you fuckin up
It just so happened that I was hot
They looked in the back on the floor
And the silver canon and they found the pot
I can't believe that I got popped
It took me 2 hours and 1500 dollars
To get unlocked
Straight from jail to the weed spot
Shit I took that as a minor setback
Hell no I ain't stop!
And I'm
Still smokin bud
Still smokin weed
Mystikal

The Bitch x6
The bitch been

Chorus: O'Dell
(Mystikal)

The bitch been sleepin' with me
(the bitch)
The bitch been sleepin with me
(the bitch been)

Mystikal

I woke up this morning, dick rock hard
This time I had scratches on my back
Agghh, lipstick on my draws
Cause me and the bitch from down the street been creepin'
I beat that pussy like a heathin'
And she keep my beeper beepin'
Don't repeat this
The whole while we was sneakin' I was cheatin'
Shhh, its a secret
My lady wanna try to kill me to find out where I was sleepin'
I guees the fuck she can't find out
Come on ho hurry up and put on your mutherfuckin' clothes
Look bitch we got to dine out
She give me locks, give me knots
Put on your draws and your socks
She make unannounced frequent stops
It wouln't be nothin pleasent if she catch us
Or find them dirty love letters
Or them pictures of you in sexy teddies
She knows its heavy breathin when we finish
Legs and shit gonna be numb
And you gonna be so ?
Find your mutherfuckin' earings and fix yo hair
Come on lets bounce up out this motherfucka before
Michael, you in there
Chorus

Mystikal

I didn't want to get into it
Get involved
I know you know thats that same broad from them late night phone calls
But I swear darlin, I done begged that bitch to stop callin'
Come on don't look at me like that
It ain't that way at all
Besides shit we ain't married I ain't got nothin' to hid
If I'de a fucked I could've told ya
She said ya ain't gotta lie
Just for your information I walked down the street on the side
When you and that bitch was gettin' outa dodge
I already found all the used rubbers so I should'nt be suprised
I guess I had to see it with my own two eyes
I said what the hell, F.B.I
She a spy
Girl pull that fuckin' skin back and call me circumsized
She said yea you make me laugh but you make me cry
And I done put up with shit, them trifflin hoes and I'm tired
I said what you tryin' to say
She said I would just let you slide but I got my pride
I love you Michael but this is goodbye
You all know why
Chorus

Mystikal

And being that I'm happily unmarried with no attachments
A black bachelor with cabbage
Bitches be throwin' pussy at me
Baby you nasy
But put your number in my bepper and I'll pick you up Saturday
She said Saturdays bad I'm off Sunday
I said Sunday I gotta got to the studio
I'll hook up with you Monday
She said damn honey Monday I'm a have my Son
And Tuesday I got an appointment at the salon to get my hair done
I said shucks it ain't no thing
Baby handle your biz
I ain't got no chil'ren but Mystikal love the kids
She said thats cool I'm free Wednesday where you live
I'll get my girlfriend to drop me off over there and thats what she did
But she pulled up with a fine ass friend
She said my girlfrien gotta go to the bathroom bad
I said go on in
But I'm go in there with ya
Show you where
Made that old girl stay down stairs
While we went upstairs
Yall know damn well the bitch freind been sleepin' with me
Chorus

[Verse 1]
If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga, I'm too deaf to move a step through shards or slip and slide
Talk back and you get me for cussin', cuttin', bustin' bustin' me
Tried to talk 'em, but they really won't pay it
Found nothin',fuck 'em fuck 'em
Inside, outside, in a state of an abomination
Don't want no confrontations, making me hit you with combinations
Kicking in bloodier faces, compilations, occupations
Back in hibernation, yeah you suffer with complications
Too in to be losin' money, too old to be time wastin'
Man, people that don't even listen to rap still buy my tape
Only Beats By The Pound gettin' down on the drum
Wit' DJ Darryl and Moe, hollywood here we come
If what you are reflects your actions, bitch I'm a man
Ahh, shut up, I don't wanna here it
Cause I'm 'a fade you and your chance
You know what you did was despicable
I sick of you, they call me Mystikal, cause I'm Unpredictable

[Hook (x2)]
I said what they thought that I wasn't gonna say
I did what they thought that I wasn't gonna do
I knew what they really not want me to know, I'm Unpredictable
Can't fight it, deny it, you're gonna get lost
Sure you can't follow the rhymes that I wrote
No one can stop me, uncover my flow I'm Unpredictable

[Verse 2]
Man, until you give it your all, you never will know what can happen
From nappy-headed ass Michael, to cold-blooded ass rapper
Sometimes the little kids be listenin'to me
And I'm tryin' to stop the cursin'
Teachin' 'em bad words and then people be gettin' nervous (Oh my God)
Calm down, I'm not that type of rapper you'll see
Besides, I know some of y'all churn out that cursin' better than me
I'm ice-cold baby, I'm zero degrees
I'm like a lumberjack, cuttin' MC's like trees
Choppin' 'em down, knocking 'em down, locking 'em down
Four years, and six months later I'm still on top of the mound
Just more powerfully now, on time for that No Limit sound
Already know what you gonna say before it come out your mouth
Yee got's to stay awake, tidin' y'all no matter whats done
Old style-stealing copycat tried to bite and bit his tounge
You can't fight that feeling, it's irresistable
Never know what I'm 'a do next, I'm Unpredictable

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
If you thinking the nigga done rolled with a other they'll take you
Nigga you heard wrong
Prime Suspects (who?), Mia X, (who?) Mr. Serv-on
Oh, you want to ride in my Mercedes
But I ain't got no more room in the back (my bad)
Whole Gambino Family in their, Kane and Abel and Mac
Got C-Murder, Colonel, the Shocker, you don't want none
Oh hell, O'Dell and VL all of the funk sons
I'm confident, don't come in conceited, ain't got no Big Ed
I'm bad like Fiend, but I B. like Craig
So don't provoke me, if you don't want to get strong-armed
Big Mann and Champ, V-Dog, be worrying might do you some harm
All that ready to put a bullet in your belly-belly
With a four-ten two shells, Boswell and Kelly-Kelly
We ain't faking, making hits and gettin' paid
You can't fade the track that the tank just made
Mystikal, I'm Unpredictable
Shit, anything else is unacceptable

[Hook]

[Intro: Mystikal]
Bitch we ain't your standard his and hers rap duo X2
Mystikal, Mia X, who the fuck you take us for  X4

[Mystikal]
You better cover your nose cause rhyme flows run like diahrrea
Burn like gonorrhea, that's me and mama Mia.....X
Explicit mistress, unlady like diva
You gonna know when you see her
You stack like you don't know
Now we run this motherfucker
That's what them No Limit Soldiers
Done this motherfucker
Ain't no stopping us now, long way from finished
Just gettin started, gaining momentum
See our faces on magazines, hear our music at parties
Movies and videos, it's kind of hard to avoid us
How many motherfuckers try to come out the south and don't sell out
Make up all the money, take up all the clout

[Chorus:]
Mystikal, Mia X we got clout
Mystikal, Mia X
Mystikal, Mia X
Mystikal, Mia X who the fuck you take us for  X3

[Mia X]
Tank mama (who) mama (mia) drama (what) biggest (mama) mama (who) ya'll know Mia
My rhymes are the pins in all the voo doo dolls
Got your earholes hexed, Mrs. X I come to set it off
With the unpredictable big ole (whooo)
Crooked like a roach leg dick nigga Mystikal
And they knows who got the clout all this
On that nigga and that broad with the tanks around they necks
We connect like infra-red dots and can't be stopped
Colossals in this game check the billboard spots, we on top
But chatter knocks and ice rocks they can't wait
That's why these No Limit Soldiers always break street date
Fakers hate yet they smile kissin ass no doubt
But two faces get you punched them both in your mouth
Who got the clout, no need to answers that
It's not a matter of who, it's a matter of fact
We got the clout

[Chorus]

[(Mystikal) Mia X]
(biggest momma and that nigga Mystikal)
(don't hold on your chest, Bitch let it go)
Whoa, we got tornadoes, nigga spinnin that ass no doubt
We got the hook up, we bout it bringin the world to the south
(never gon bounce off the billboard count)
(No Limit in there, how they do that there)
Yeah, you can give me trigger man and that hard shit
And Mama Mia still gon stay up on her guard bitch
(gettin rich makin hits to the filthy dirty)
(Bitch I'm almost 30, we livin like we slangin birdies)
You heard me, you heard him you know what we bout
You know you can't doubt that we got the clout
(Bitch we got the clout)

Hey, what's this on your iPod? tell me what you listening to
Why you jumping 'bout his money? I ain't hear him mention you
I know this aggravate you, and it upset ya
But I can change you, I know how you hear me, is this better?
Yeah girl you like this, yeah, this your language
Life is short and black and white just like little penguins
Why you were in social studies screaming and argue?
Why you Doctor Kill Joy shooting up the party?
Where you get that money from? wait, where you running to?
Why I'm hearing sirens? where them blue lights coming to?
Dog, you a genius, you can blueprint and plan this
'Stead of playing video games, why don't you take advantage?

I don't understand you, you the school's biggest cut up
Riding in your momma car, booming like a motherfucker
Why you always spitting for? what you get her digits for?
Don't you know with no money, that girl is not gon' give you none?
Life doesn't dish out, why you got your fist out?
Oh, you just gon' run in there and five finger discount?
Talking 'bout "Where the weed at?" wait, what you coughing for?
I thought you was an expert, now listen to the officer

[Bridge]
I know you're alive and there's a lantern lit inside
It's not just burning bright
It won't blow up in your face if you try
I know you try hard, but you gotta try harder
Now you got your light, you can find your way
You're a multitasker, you're doing things faster
Are you gon' let this God-given gift decay? Wait

[Chorus]
You so anti, don't I matter? (What?)

You fuck around like you ADHD, ADHD, ADHD

[Chorus]
Sooner or later, it all comes crashing down (Crashing down)

To not make a sound (To make a sound)
But everyone knows now

[Verse 1]
(So you're sad) about the moment, you lost your love (Damn)
You couldn't see her leaving (You were gassed)
And that's sucks don't it, cause God yanked the rug (Damn)

[Verse 3]
(So you're sad) could've had so much done, you blew it off (Damn)
Your chances passing you by (You were gassed)
Time waits for no one, and it cost for a loss (Damn)
A cosmic joke, should you laugh or cry?

[Chorus]
Sooner or later, it all comes crashing down (Crashing down)
Crashing down (Crashing down)
When everyone's around, I bet
You would've paid up all your cash down (Your cash down)

[Pharrell]
I was walking, down the street
Saw this girl, she smell so sweet
....Hey baby...
She start running, so I could chase
How they get them saffires, in yo face
....Hey baby...

So we start walking, and holding hands
But she don't know, that daddy got plans
I'm gon' get her, in my car
In the backseat, show her a rock star

She said, "I been hugged, and I been kissed
But ain't no other boy, make me feel like this."
....I know baby...
So then she starts screaming, and reaching for the door
"Daddy I ain't never felt this before!"

Stay in the car, put the windows up
No seatbelt, no need to buckle up
Emergency brakes, no need for the clutch
But wait... ah, don't get a ticket girl!

[Hook - Pharrell]
Backseat love, backseat love
Backseat love, backseat love
Backseat love, backseat love
Backseat love, backseat love
Backseat love, backseat love
Backseat love, backseat love
Backseat love, backseat love
Backseat love, backseat..

Love, love, (backseat love) love, love (backseat love)
Love, love, (backseat love) love, love (backseat love)

[Part I: Wonderful Place]

[Intro]
Yeah, uh huh, let's do it
Damn

[Verse 1]
It's setting in now
Cause cartoons are turning into real life
Lemons and limes are fighting
Fighting over straws like they were oil filled pipes
Why's the sun writing the song?
Why is this funny to me?
All of a sudden a mouse come along
And what he sings, it brings harmony

[Pre-Chorus]
You may not understand why there's a smile on my face
It's cause this world would be such a wonderful place
If some of these companies in two-thousand three get erased
But not me man, I see a wonderful place

[Chorus]
Muscles in my smile, don't frown
Just get up, get up
Muscles in my smile, don't frown
Just get up, get up
Muscles in my smile, don't frown
Just get up, get up
Muscles in my smile, don't frown
Just get up, get up

[Verse 2]
The wallpaper's moving
My arms and my legs leave a blur when I swipe
Sap is just oozing
But trees say that smoke blocks the sun
So for them, it's just night
The seven eyes look in through the clouds
And why is that funny to me?
And here comes the mouse singing loud
And what he sings brings harmony

[Pre-Chorus]
You may not understand why there's a smile on my face
It's cause this world would be such a wonderful place
If some of these companies in two-thousand three get erased
But not me man, I see a wonderful place

[Chorus]
Muscles in my smile, don't frown
Just get up, get up
Muscles in my smile, don't frown
Just get up, get up
Muscles in my smile, don't frown
Just get up, get up
Muscles in my smile, don't frown
Just get up, get up
Muscles in my smile, don't frown
Just get up, get up
Muscles in my smile, don't frown
Just get up, get up
Muscles in my smile, don't frown
Just get up, get up
Muscles in my smile, don't frown
Just get up, get up

[Part II: Waiting for You]

[Verse 1]
So she tells her man: "Let's go fishin'
We'll go tomorrow morning when the sun rise"
And then she says she wants to take her kids and...
That's her boy that's 12 and her daughter that's 4, with angel eyes
So they get there... and the sun has barely risen
Decided on a spot where the fish is plentiful with the tide
Get out their poles, Daddy smiles and said the fish is jumpin'
Then they heard a splash, but it sounded bigger than fish size
The 12 year old screams "Mom!"
And Mom screams back "the baby was holdin' your arm"
Well that was 30 seconds ago, so they jumped in
All comin' up with nothin'... but then...
Something told Mom, to look toward the light
But the sun wasn't yellow, it had turned white
So she listen and swam, she swam for the light
Like the Michelin Man, she swam with such might
She spotted the baby, and she was on her back
Just as the light said, "Sunrise was Heaven's track"
She turned the baby over, her eyes were still blue
The baby had a smile and said

[Hook/Outro]
"I was waitin' for you!
Mom I was waitin' for you!"
Your baby
Momma! I love you
And I was waitin' for you
Hey
I was waitin' for you
I was waitin' for you
Momma
I was waitin' for you
I love you ma

Sometimes it seems all wrong, I won't stop till it's all gone

They wanna know why I hit like that
Spit like that, shit like that
Maybe cause I get like that
Kick like that, rip like that
They wanna know why I rhyme like that
Shine like that, glime like that
Cause the world is mine like that
(Yours like that?) Mine like that

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Maaan you could get your whole crew
Even niggas that owe you, and paid you shit!
You could drink some cold brews
And throw on them bold shoes, and jump in the whip!
You could come and find us, and be right behind us
And insert the clips
You hear something go CLAK CLAK CLAK!
Somebody went down! But it wasn't us
You could sell about 2 mill', get hooked wit a good deal
And start stacking dough
You could get your mo-biles, ride 20 inch big wheels
And collect some hoes
You could even start eating good, and smoking good
But you pressing your luck
And you say what? Somebody went bankrupt?!
But it wasn't us

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
You could be going on worldwide tours
And see your face on every magazine
Or you could flip through channel after channel
And see yourself on the TV screen
You could pay for expensive videos
And have a whole lotta big booty hoes
But when that shit start coming to a close
Damn! But it wasn't us
You could use your backup plan
And even call up your backup man and start thinking quick!
You could call up the backup hoes
And even call some to backup those, and tell 'em "suck a dick!"
Then you tell 'em just to get on these
Or you tell 'em just to pay their fees, or to pay them dues
And if you catching them STDs, damn!
But it wasn't us

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Infamous 2-0]
You could bring your whole squad and your bodyguard
Fuck it, dog, you could bring ya block
But I got me a AK, and a couple of them SKs
So you all gettin' shot
You could sell them hard-hard, them E pills
And every nigga wanna smoke on the dro
And when the Fed's come and kick ya door, pick up ya ho
I'm like "Whoa!" And it wasn't us
You could even flip a whole brick, wit ya whole click
So everybody riding out on the Sprees
But you got you a problem dude, I got the robbin' crews
So everybody gotta get on they knees
You could even make a chained dog, get a main broad
Even let her stay inside of ya crib
But the bitch got no choice, she love my voice
And now I put it way inside of her grills
You could even make a phone call to ya road dogs
'Cause I'm the nigga that ya fear in the South
Then you try to do a new tune, called the Neptunes
But Pharrell wasn't hearing ya out
You could even try to blame me, cause ya whole crew framed me
But I'm still gon' bust
If the Feds try to name me, hey, it ain't me, and uh
And it wasn't us!

[Hook x2]

[Intro]
You should smokes with me

[Hook]
The chronic's blowing
The chronic's blowing
The chronic's blowing
The chronic's blowing (It blows my mind)

[Verse 1 - Snoop Dogg]
Blowing chronic to me, it's like a tradition to me
I got the pi-doun, so sit down and listen to me
Don't go against me fool, go wit me
We could blow it all together like Bobby Brown and Whitney
Yeah, we got something in common
They could search a nigga, but they never finding my bomb and
I got the stash, spot, my cash got
Lot of motherfuckas pulling, police shots
I'm not "The One" nigga you could call me "The Two"
Bob Marley reincarnated, pupils dilated
Emancipated, concentrated, debated, rated many times
You suprised how I made it, huh?
You hate it, huh, but you know, I ain't even trippin
I'm spliting that Swisha up, plotting on the come up
I'm living my life, and never putting my gun up
Dranking my drink, and I'mma smoke that blunt

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg]
The greener the tree, the better the bud
The strength of the branch, will tell you how chronic it was
I'm - buzzing high, sliding, slippin
Gotcha listening to Snoop and now you feel like you crippin
It's all to the good, the dash is wood
You got some hoes in ya truck and now ya ready to fuck
But, they frontin and fakin, and time is waistin
She don't wanna give ya number now she hollin at Jason
Now don't get mad, just roll to the pad
And keep a G on the bitch and roll another dub bag
(My nigga) light that shit, hit that bitch
Then past it to ya homie like playa, pimp (blaze that bitch)
And when you get dizzone, crack the do'
And let me get a little snizzle
Cause ain't no fun, if the homies can't get none
Puff, puff, pass my nigga, one lizza

[Hook]

[Bridge x2]
Do you wanna smoke wit me (Do you wanna?)
Come and keep me company
Baby come and fuck with me
You should smokes with me

[Verse 3 - Snoop Dogg]
It's the diabolical, chronical, mythological
Psychological, make a model ho, fuck a G
Pre-medical, steady slow those, ready can get it
Teacher taught it to those with mind apparatus
My status has been the baddest ever since I intro'd
I'm that nigga that brought y'all the info
On the Chucks, French braids, and endo
Big Snoop Dogg with the fog on the window
Spell ya name in it, put ya face in it
And hang with the nigga with the gang bang spinach
Drag it, blunt wrap it, or zig-zag it
Don't really matter even if it's in the package
Put it to the side, so when ya boy hit the Eastside
I'm look for the firefied cheefa
Aiyyo Pharrell, gimme that VA discount
I'm tryna bounce wit the whole ounce (smoke me out)

[Hook]

[Bridge x2]

[Hook]
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya

[Laughs]

[Intro: Pharrell]
Sorry that we took so long
You probably thought we forgot your song
It makes us smile just so you know
To see your eyes at our shows

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
I wrote this song while I was drunk
I hope you don't mind that it was wine
But you called me and said you didn't want your friends to know
But what if you had to go
What about then
What about then Mildred
Excuse me I mean music
But what about then?

[Hook: Pharrell]
Sweet chariot of fire
Gon' swing us all the way
Sing us a song today, awayay
Awayay awayay
Awayay awayay
Awayay awayay
Or maybe I'm in your car just driving away
And everything's ok

[Verse 2 - Pharrell]
Float around where there's no need to walk
And there's nothing but thoughts and feeling no talk
Where there's golden bees and silver birds
And dreams are like sheep they come true in herds
And every moment
Feels like a spin, Mildred
I mean, a spin music
So what about then

[Hook: Pharrell]
Sweet chariot of fire
Gon' swing us all the way
Sing us a song today, awayay
Awayay awayay
Awayay awayay
Awayay awayay
Or maybe I'm in your car just driving away
And everything's ok

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
Where every star flickers bright as a sister
Just but the whisper commands your love
The bright sun in the sky all the flowers harmonize
And that's where your starry eyes will stand above

[Interlude: Pharrell]
(Mildred, Mildred) The fuck I mean, Mildred?
(Mildred, Mildred) How the fuck you gonna tell me it's Mildred
(Mildred, Mil-I'm sorry)
(Music) And not music
Fuck it

[Hook: Pharrell]
Sweet chariot of fire
Gon' swing us all the way
Sing us a song today, awayay
Awayay awayay
Awayay awayay
Awayay awayay
Or maybe I'm in your car just driving away
And everything's ok

[Hook]
Drill sergeant I don't work for you
I'm not going to war (I'm not going to war)
I'm a cashier wielding books
I work at the Barnes & Noble store (Barnes & Noble store!)
You must think you're Orson Welles and this is 1954
You don't understand liberty until
Someone speaks for yours (someone speaks for yours)

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Shame on you
Singing 'serve your country' while I'm young
Shame on you
Mixing my mind up, handing me guns
Bye bye mom and dad and all
Just in case there is failure
I could be blaming you
But I got something to tell ya

[Hook]
Drill sergeant I don't work for you
I'm not going to war (I'm not going to war)
I'm a cashier wielding books
I work at the Barnes & Noble store (Barnes & Noble store!)
You must think you're Orson Welles and this is 1954
You don't understand liberty until
Someone speaks for yours (someone speaks for yours)

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
Aim on you
Level their buildings, destroy their soil
Aim on you
Did you finally figure where to run that oil, fuck it
Why cry if man should die?
When there's probable failure or
I could just aim on you
But I got something to tell ya

[Hook]
Drill sergeant I don't work for you
I'm not going to war (I'm not going to war)

You must think you're Orson Welles and this is 1954
You don't understand liberty until
Someone speaks for yours (someone speaks for yours)

[Bridge]
Maybe there's another way
That we can bond, bond, bond, bond, bond, bond, bond, bond, bond
Maybe there's another way
That we can bond, bond, bond, bond, bond, bond, bond, bond, bond
Maybe there's another way
That we can bond, bond, bond, bond, bond, bond, bond, bond, bond
Maybe there's another way

[Outro]
I'm not going to war...
I love you
You mean the world to me

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Just a minute ago...
Just a minute ago...
Just a minute ago I said somethings I know
That I can't change that
But when I just screamed
That didn't mean for us to break
Break our pact

[Hook]
I'm searching for my way back
But I'm looking through a peep hole
I'm trying to find my way back
I wanna be your hero

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
I'm here, you're there...
I'm here, you're there...
I'm here, you're there, between us is air
But no one is breathing
How can this be
It's your face I see
This is so crazy
We're in the same room

[Hook]
I'm searching for my way back
But I'm looking through a peep hole
I'm trying to find my way back
I wanna be your hero

I love you...forever

[Bridge]
I don't care what it takes
But I know we got to get there
We got to get there
I can see it now, you and me
I know nothing will change
If the both if us just sit here
If we just sit here
C'mon join me girl
Can't you see

[Hook]
(Hey!)
I'm searching for my way back
(I'm lost.....where am I?)
But I'm looking through a peep hole
(I just wanna go home)
I'm trying to find my way back
(I'm out here by myself)
I wanna be your hero
(I'm lost in space)
I'm searching for my way back
(My rocket won't start)
But I'm looking through a peep hole
(I just wanna see you)
I'm trying to find my way back
(Hey, my rocket won't start)
I wanna be your hero
(I wanna be you)
I'm searching for my way back

But I'm looking through a peep hole

[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Uhh huh, uhh huh, uhh huh, fly!
Whoo! Whoooo!
This is for the kids!
This is only for the kids!
Come on!

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Mommy! Daddy! I know, you love me
Bad grades, Playstations
Restrictions, you take it from me
But God forbids, something goes wrong
You call, the police
Well guess what! I found
In the drawer, of Daddy's

[Hook: Pharrell & Shae]
Oh God (oh God!) Ohh God (oh God!)
Oh God (oh God!) Hey! (c'mon!)
It won't be long, till you see me on the news!
Another soul lost at sea - while taking a cruise!
Gasping for air makes the righteous path - harder to choose
What if he'd fly or die, sink or swim!
Which one shall I choose? (Yeah!)

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
Stupid shrink - get paid, by the hour - 350
He can't - figure out, what's wrong - with me
Dumbass - girlfriend, fuck my friend - she's a ho
I tried telling - mom and dad
But they're more concerned - with the portfolio

[Hook: Pharrell & Shae]
Oh God (oh God!) Ohh God (oh God!)
Oh God (oh God!) Hey! (c'mon!)
It won't be long, till you see me on the news!
Another soul lost at sea - while taking a cruise!
Gasping for air makes the righteous path - harder to choose
What if he'd fly or die, sink or swim!
Which one shall I choose? (Yeah!)

[Verse 3: Pharrell & Shae]
Now I'm in with - the negotiator
And he says to me (you don't want to die boy)
(It's not the right time, you have a bright mind)
(You'll do great things in your lifetime)
I screamed NO!! I beat his ass
He turned around, I seen his wings
And just then, the bell rings
I was in school, it was just a dream!

[Hook: Pharrell & Shae]
Oh God (oh God!) Ohh God (oh God!)
Oh God (oh God!) Hey! (c'mon!)
It won't be long, till you see me on the news!
Another soul lost at sea - while taking a cruise!
Gasping for air makes the righteous path - harder to choose
What if he'd fly or die, sink or swim!
Which one shall I choose? (Yeah!)

[Outro: Pharrell]
It won't be long
Gasping for air makes the righteous path - harder to choose
Fly or die, sink or swim!
Which one shall I choose? (Yeah!)

[Intro - Pharrell]

[Verse]
I've been all around the Earth
There no girls that kiss me first
But you just stand there with a smirk
But don't you worry about it, ahh - OWW!!

BABY!!! Don't fool wit me
If you don't wanna give it up

Baby look at your girl starin at me
And her girl, in the next seat
They want a menage three, don't worry about it
OWW!! I said BABY!! Don't fool wit me
If you don't wanna give it up
Don't worry about it (worry about it)
Chocolate flower.. uh (worry about it)

[Bridge]
See, I know I got them other girls
But I wanna learn from youuuu
There's a war going on outside no man is safe from
And I'm not trying to looossee, I need you
They say, damn Pharrell! you have a cold heart, will you move?
So when it comes to a girl like you, that moves me
What am I supposed to do? .. but admit it
You're you're you're bad ass
You're you're, c'mon sing it wit me

[Hook]
She's bad bad, bad ass (uh)

She's bad bad, bad ass (she)

[Outro - Pharrell]
Don't worry about it..
Don't worry about it

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Hate when they call me superstar
Do I look like a superstar?
Yet unreachable and very far
Ever noticed I'm right here wit' y'all?
I cover my face because
They do not need to see
I ain't no gangsta or no thug
I am just being me
The world smells of drama
So I cover up my nose
The faces like film leavin' out too long, gets overexposed
Getting praised by magazines
From the girlfriends in my clothes
I hope they still love me when I shun away
Cause I am afraid to blow

[Hook: Pharrell]
WANT WAR?!!
(Well!) WAR WE'LL GIVE!
(We'll be rocking this) BANDANA!
(Well!) So you
CAN'T SEE SHIT!

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
Now the fear of blowing up
Definitely takes its toll
It sends its demons down to your mind to take control
If it thinks it's got my mind
It-it better think again
I got the pleasure of the piano and this powerful pen
But you (You!)
You want fifteen minutes to shine, what's your concept?
What's so interesting? What's your desire?
Soon as you get your cover story
And your precious headlines
So sorry, so sorry, so sorry
They'll just fuck you from behind

[Hook: Pharrell]
WANT WAR?!!
Well! WAR WE'LL GIVE!
We'll be rocking this BANDANNA!
(Well! You) So You
CAN'T SEE SHIT!

[Bridge: Pharrell]
I don't wanna blow up
I'm smiling cause I know
All the pieces that make me me will glisten from my soul
My self-esteem is not a fake
It comes from within
Come and take a picture
I'll sign whatever you want my friend
Still... (Still..), Still... (Still..)
Yeah!
...War

[Hook: Pharrell]
WANT WAR?!?
Well! WAR WE'LL GIVE!
We'll be rocking this BANDANA!
(Well! You) So You
CAN'T SEE SHIT!

...WANT WAR!??!

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
It just happened, so what?
But they're all laughing, what's up?
Why the tears? have no fear
We are here for you
But I know how you feel
I know how you feel when no one cares

[Bridge: Pharrell & (Shae)]
If you feel just like I feel (push people)
Everythings plastic, nothings real (push people)
Fuck your lover face, not steal (push people)
We're just dancing, no big deal (push people)
Hey just let the bullshit pass (push people)
Or we'll skateboard your ass (push people)
Got more bombs, more wheels (push people)
We're just dancing, no big deal (push people)

[Hook: Pharrell & (Shae)]
Breakout (push people) breakout
Breakout (push people) breakout
Breakout (push people) breakout
Breakout (push people) breakout

Breakout (push people) breakout
(Push people) break awayyyyy (push people)

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
All you can be is just you
Cause you're real, not the plastic type
But reality sets in this dark and this plastic life
Why the tears? we're all here for you
But I know how you feel
I know how you feel and I do care

[Bridge: Pharrell & (Shae)]
If you feel just like I feel (push people)
Everythings plastic, nothings real (push people)
Fuck your lover face, not steal (push people)
We're just dancing, no big deal (push people)

[Outro: Pharrell]
Just as long as we got the same thing in our veins
You and I, we are both the same
I'll bail you out, show you what you should see
One love, N.E.R.D, peace

[Intro]
HO! HO! HO! HO!
HO! HO! HO! HO!

[Verse 1 - Pharrell]
Every once in a while there is some asshole
Giving you shit, cause something in his life won't fold
Usually, I'd walk away
The "peace" offering another day
He seems not to wanna trade
So he must pay (its the inevitable, it's going down!)

[Bridge - Pharrell]
He's talking! (fuck him up!) at me (fuck him up!)
Instead of! (fuck him up!) to me (fuck him up!)
My intelligence! (fuck him up!) sacked me (fuck him up!)
But he says! (fuck him up!) he'll run through me (fuck him up!)

[Hook - Pharrell]
(THRASHER!) I'm a (THRASHER!)
I'm a (THRASHER!) you ain't know (THRASHER!)
That I'm a (THRASHER!) I'm a (THRASHER!)
I'm a (THRASHER!) I'm a (THRASHER!) I'm a..

[Verse 2 - Pharrell]
Every once in a while there's that same asshole
Try to swing and hit, cause the things he can't control
And God knows what will unfurl
Either with or without his girl
Cause I browsed down, his fingers curled
Like it's his world (its the inevitable, it's going down!)

[Bridge - Pharrell]
He's talking! (fuck him up!) at me (fuck him up!)
Instead of! (fuck him up!) to me (fuck him up!)
My intelligence! (fuck him up!) sacked me (fuck him up!)
But he says! (fuck him up!) he'll run through me (fuck him up!)

[Hook - Pharrell]
(THRASHER!) I'm a (THRASHER!)
I'm a (THRASHER!) you ain't know (THRASHER!)
That I'm a (THRASHER!) I'm a (THRASHER!)
I'm a (THRASHER!) I'm a (THRASHER!) I'm a..

[Verse 3 - Pharrell]
Now I know that slime ballers laying out and all
But he said things that were so uncalled for
But he deserved it (the boy deserved it)
And I know your his girl but you should ride wit me
Cause I'll show you feelings that you've never seen
Keep this rocking it's brown mixed with green (we'll be swervin)

[Outro]
HO! HO! HO! HO!
HO! HO! HO! HO!
HO! HO! HO! HO!
HO! HO! HO! HO!

[Intro]
Love was the egg, see

[Verse 1]
And it was born in a cloud with silver lining
Uh-huh
But it broke
I mean it hatched on the ground so time flew right by me
And voila

[Pre-Hook]
I know you thought that life was gon' be easy when you didn't call
You found out you were wrong
See, I know you thought your life was gon' be easy
You thought you had it all
But you found that you were wrong

[Hook]
See, maybe, there was something wrong
And you weren't telling me, no (Nooooo)
See, see, maybe, the laugh's on me (joke's on me)
And life was telling me a joke

[Verse 2]
Well, they say that if it's yours
And you let it go
If it comes back to you
It was yours all along

Well, I let you go, along with those lies from you
I wonder what else lies in you
Or did the lies just eat it gone

[Pre-Hook]
I know you thought that life was gon' be easy when you didn't call
You found out you were wrong
See, I know you thought your life was gon' be easy
You thought you had it all
But you found that you were wrong

[Hook]
See, maybe, there was something wrong
And you weren't telling me, no (Nooooo)
See, see, maybe, the laugh's on me (joke's on me)
And life was telling me a joke
Babe

[Interlude: Pharrell]
Hold it now
Y'all there?
How do you feel right now
Yeah me too
Hey Yeah
Oh, babe!
Hold it now

[Outro: Pharrell]
Y'all alright?
See
Do you remember... what it's like to wake up in... her love nest?
Get it, love nest
And now she's gone, gone, gone, gone
At which point you realize...
Life is but a joke
And the laugh's on you
It's funny, right?
Babe!

[*dialing*]

[*ringing*]

[Verse 1 - Pharrell]
Hello? Hey mom, it's me mom
Can't tell you where I sleep mom
Cause that's where we be mom
Sometimes I steal and cheat mom
Yes, I get enough to eat mom
Mom, can you listen to me?
No! I don't mess with guns
Yes in my travels I have seen one
No, being a runaway is no fun
But house rules sure were not fun
Something told me to

[Hook - Joel Madden & Benji Madden]
(Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!)

[Verse 2 - Joel Madden]
Hey dad, I'm ok dad, that's what you say dad
I never could obey dad
You would have bad days dad
And you would make me pay dad make me feel way sad
Punk rock, tattoos, leather jacket
Good grades don't come with that package
Yes y'all I would love to match it
But names just make it harder to hack it by

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Pharrell] + (Joel Madden)
Don't let your teachers teach you about wealth to death
Maybe there's something else (I'm checking out)
Don't let NASA teach you that we are by ourselves

Oh la la la, la la, la la - la la la, la la, la la
Shh.. maybe there's something else (I'm checking out)
See we're not part of the Magna Carta
There's no shuttle for us to charter
No... they're keeping it for themselves (I'm checking out)
My ex-girlfriend I'm trying
And her new boyfriend I'd fight him
And what about my cousins?
Tell em that I love 'em
I'm not perfect nor facetious
But at home I've felt fearless
Your son completely hateless
Turn to BBC you should see this
A thousand heads

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I woke up thinking something (I'm checking out) (jump!)

(Her name) She's sexy!!
Move, she wants to move
But you're hogging her, you're guarding her
She wants to move (she wants to move)
She wants to move (she wants to move)
But you're hogging her, you're guarding her (damn!)

[Hook - Pharrell Williams] (Shae)
Mister! Look at your girl, she loves it!
(Look at her) I can see it in her eyes
She (come here babe) hopes this lasts forever, Hey!!

[Verse - Pharrell Williams] (Shae)
Her off beat dance makes me fantasize
(Her curves) She's sexy!!
Her ass is a spaceship I want to ride
(Her ass) She's sexy!!
Move, she wants to move
But you're hogging her, you're guarding her
She wants to move (she wants to move)
She wants to move (she wants to move)
But you're hogging her, you're guarding her (beat it!!)

[Hook - Pharrell Williams] (Shae)
Mister! Look at your girl, she loves it!
(I know you love it girl) I can see it in her eyes
She - hopes this lasts forever (hey) Hey!!

[Interlude/Bridge - Pharrell Williams] (Shae)
Ehh, this is your part girl
Uh, this is your part girl!!
(Move, she wants to move) c'mon!
OWW! (Move, she wants to move) ehh

Somebody get us some water in here!
Cause it's HOT!
(Yo why you, why you, why you wit that fool?)
HOT y'all! Hey! Huuuhh!
(I like it when you're wet baby) Ehh

[Pharrell]
So she tells her man:
"Let's go fishin'"
We'll go tomorrow morning when the sun rise...
And then she says she wants to take her kids and (*baby crying*)
That's her boy that's 12, and her daughter that's 4 with angel eyes
So they get there... and the sun has barely risen
Decided on a spot where the fish is plentiful with the tide
Get out their poles, daddy smiles and said the fish is jumpin'
Then they heard a splash but it sounded bigger than fish size

12 year old screams: "Mom!!!"
And Mom screams back:
"The baby was holdin' your arm"
Well, that was 30 seconds ago
So they jumped in
All comin' up with nothin'
But then...

Something told mom
To look toward the light
But the sun wasn't yellow
It had turned white
So she listen and swam
She swam for the light
Like the Michelin Man
She swam with such might
She spotted the baby
And she was on her back
Just as the light said "Sunrise was Heaven's track"
She turned the baby over
Her eyes were still blue
Baby had a smile and said...

"I was waitin' for you!"
Mom, I was waitin' for you!!!
Your baby!!
Momma!
I love you!
And I was waitin for you!
(Hey!)

I was waitin' for you..
I was waitin' for you..
Momma...
I was waitin' for you..
I love you ma...

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Unzip your skirt
Take off your blouse
I hope your toes are painted
Cause you gon dance in your undies all over the house

[Bridge]
When your eyes are closed
I hope I'm the man you see (the man you see)
Cause if not, I want you to know
Tonight I plan to be
Is this for me? HO!

[Hook]
Slow motion like a dream
But real time is what it seems
I love the way she dance
Slow motion like a dream
But real time is what it seems
I love the way she dance
See I love the way she dance
Girl, I love the way you dance

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
I am in your aquarium
Are you a mermaid or something?
Is it possible to marry one?
Big tits, fat ass and turquoise skin

[Bridge]
When your eyes are closed
I hope I'm the man you see (the man you see)
Cause if not, I want you to know
Tonight I plan to be
Is this for me? HO!

[Hook]
Slow motion like a dream
But real time is what it seems
I love the way she dance
Slow motion like a dream
But real time is what it seems
I love the way she dance
See I love the way she dance
Girl, I love the way you dance
Calling all cars, please arrest her
(She's a criminal in my dreams)
She just stole my heart
(It's an A.P.B.)

[Hook]
Slow motion like a dream
But real time is what it seems
I love the way she dance
Slow motion like a dream
But real time is what it seems
I love the way she dance
See I love the way she dance
Girl, I love the way you dance

[Outro: Pharrell, Shae & Chad]
Kissing you, kissing me, it's Euphoria
Remission two, remission three, it's kissing four of ya
(When sparks fly, sparks fly) I think that's love
(When sparks fly, sparks fly) Don't you think
Close your eyes, hold my hand, concentration
No destination
Just dance on constellations
(When sparks fly, when sparks fly) I think that's love
(When sparks fly, when sparks fly) Don't you think
Excuse me, but girl come with me
See you and I can be each other's company
Can't you see
(When sparks fly, sparks fly) I think that's love
(When sparks fly, sparks fly) Don't you think

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Woke up, I had the same clothes on I had on last night
I must have passed out
And cash is just like the clothes I worn yesterday
We are broke, I gotta get my ass out
I went to see what my friend was talking about
He told me cocaine could get you clout
My momma said he's trouble and school's my route
But I went to high school and got kicked out
So I'm driving this truck down 95
I pray to God I make it home alive
I don't get pulled over by the man
I just want to make it home to hold your hand

[Hook]
Goodbye, beloved one
Do you know what I am?
If you don't see my face no more
I'm a provider, girl, gotta face the streets tonight
Goodbye, beloved one
Do you know what I am?
If you don't see my face no more
I'm a rider, girl, gotta face the streets tonight

[Verse 2]
You say you don't want me to go, but I have to
Please, don't weep, I love you
I refuse to be a bum
Especially coming where I'm from
I'm a provider, girl, and I love you
So it's just like I said before
Heading down 95, dodging Johnny law
I don't need a ticket, though I never got one
If he pulls me over, he gon' feel my shotgun
I think about life, pull down my hat
It's just like this road, I don't know where I'm at
I don't want to be another cocaine story
Will I find my sanity where I find my glory
Come on

[Hook]
Goodbye, beloved one
Do you know what I am?
If you don't see my face no more
I'm a provider, girl, gotta face the streets tonight
Goodbye, beloved one
Do you know what I am?
If you don't see my face no more
I'm a rider, girl, gotta face the streets tonight

[Bridge]
Someday, this will be over
We'll raise a family
I'll get a job, and I'll be a voter
And if I die, it will change you
I'll watch over our family
But only as an angel

So don't tell me you don't know what you see
When you're looking at a motherfucker just like me
I'm a provider, girl
I said, don't tell me you don't know what you see
When you're looking at a motherfucker just like me
I'm a rider, girl

[Hook]
Goodbye, beloved one
Do you know what I am?
If you don't see my face no more
I'm a provider, girl, gotta face the streets tonight
Goodbye, beloved one
Do you know what I am?
If you don't see my face no more
I'm a rider, girl, gotta face the streets tonight

[Outro]
I love you, girl
I'm doing this for us
I don't know any better
What am I supposed to do?
Nothing?
I love you

[Intro]
What do you think baby

[Verse 1]
I know I want you
And you know you want me
But can you promise please
You'll say yes to me
I love how you think
You think oh so deep
And share your thoughts with me
I buzz then fall asleep

[Hook]
Do you really even love me
If you do there is no pain
Do I really even love you
Or do I really love your brain, brain
I just love your brain, brain

[Verse 2]
Girl unlatch your bra
But first unlatch your jaw
It's cool to call me dog
But your head is under my paw
Soon as your lips part
Then your tongue it starts
My pulse just races hard
Enough to pop my heart
I'm so high

[Hook]
Do you really even love me
If you do there is no pain
Do I really even love you
Or do I really love your brain, brain
I just love your brain, brain

[Bridge]
Yeah, hands up, if you feel like that
Yeah, hands up, if you feel like that
Yeah, hands up, if you feel like that
Hey, huh, hey, what?
Yeah, hands up, if you feel like that
Yeah, hands up, if you feel like that
Yeah, hands up, if you feel like that
Hey, huh, hey, what?

[Verse 3]
The things you think on me
The games you play on me
And stay the day on me
The words you say on me
When we party hop
Bathroom countertop
Or in your old man's truck
Grocery parking lot

[Hook]
Do you really even love me
If you do there is no pain
Do I really even love you
Or do I really love your brain, brain
I just love your brain, brain
I just love your brain, brain
I just love your brain, brain

[Verse 1]
Babe
For what I'm about to ask
Don't be ashamed
I just love you girl
Babe
As time will surely pass
Love shows it flame
In my fuck you world

Relax girl
Sip some of my slurpee
You don't have to lie to me
It's fly to me
And this way
You can have your privacy
And at the same time I can see

[Chorus]
Look, I just wanna, tape you, all night, yeah
Hey baby, I just wanna, tape you, all night, yeah

[Verse 2]
Babe, please don't let this make you think my love has swayed
No way okay
Baby girl
This is not her idea
It's mine single-handedly
It's just my fantasy
There's only one and when you're done
It's ours just for fun
And then please give me some
Listen we'll call her gold and you'll be platinum
I just want to see you come ...out

[Chorus]
Look, I just wanna, tape you, all night, yeah
Look here sugar, I just wanna, tape you, all night, yeah
I just wanna, tape you mama, all night, yeah
I just wanna, tape you, all night, yeah

[Bridge]
Nah baby don't worry about
Your makeup
I promise I won't be jealous and break up
Not to patronize and sound fake but
If this is a dream I don't want to wake up
Nah baby don't worry about
Your makeup
I promise I won't be jealous and break up
Not to patronize and sound fake but
If this is a dream I ain't wakin' up

[Verse 4]
Turn on the purple lights
Begin flashin'
By removing your fashion
And start tongue lashin'
Now girl kiss her boobs
And you kiss her boobs too
And let your finger dash in
Lights, camera, action

[Outro]
Tape you, all night, yeah
Hey sugar, I just wanna, tape you, all night, yeah
I just wanna, tape you, all night, yeah
Hey little mama, I just wanna, tape you, all night, yeah
I just wanna, tape you, all night, yeah
Hey I just wanna, tape you, little mama
I just wanna, tape you, all night, yow!
I just wanna, tape you, you and your girl, baby
Hey little mama, you and your girl, all night
Just tapin'
It's just my fantasy
Don't be afraid
It's all right (and cut)

[Verse 1]

[Verse 1: Pharrell + (Shay Haley)]
Help me! 'Cause I can feel the fumes
'Cause someone uncool has made it inside the room
Our ideas get shared, not a good one gets spared
And you're just sittin there suckin up the air
(Okay, you got it, you wanna do somethin 'bout it?)
(Wait a minute, what's wrong, somethin broke?) C'mon!
Help me! Is that a snake I just saw?
Well they can only live where the grass and weeds are tall
Well I'm stuck and no cost to please my eyes
And no, I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
C'mon!!!

[Bridge]
YEAH! DIE BITCH DIE! Uhhh

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
Help me! 'Cause this ain't good for my health
So you can have this room and do them yourself
My oath won't let me conspire
While your presence set our sanctuary on fire
Help me! 'Cause your intentions aren't pure
'Cause cool can only be killed, never absorbed
And I will not stop or compromise
And no, I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
C'mon!!

[Bridge]
WOOO! YEAH! YEAH! Uhhh

[Verse 3]
Help me! Understand why you're surprised
But never mind that, please look outside
Submarines and flying machines and fellas you know
Point signs that say we shoulda nuked you a long time ago
Help me! See those war machines out there?
A pack with your karma, do you care?
Just know karma doesn't stop when you cry
And no, I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
C'mon!!!

[Bridge]
WOOO! YEAH! YEAH! Yeahhhh

[Outro]
Help me!

[Congressman Patrick Kennedy]
If anybody wants to know where cynicism is, cynicism is that there's one, two, press people in this gallery. We're talking about Eric Massa 24/7 on the TV, we're talking about war and peace, three billion dollars, a thousand lives and no press?! No press?! You wanna know why the American public is fit, they're fit because they're not seeing their congress do the work that they're said to do. It's because the press, the press of the United States is not covering the most significant issue of national importance, and that's a laying of lives down in the nation, for the service of our country. It's despicable, the national press core right now

[Pharrell]
Mmm Dada, I'm sure you can tell
It's in the air, of our nation
It may shock ya, the maddest hallucination
But the dead people, they'll be dressed well (yeah)
They say

[Shay Haley]
What's yo' name? You the one starin
Oh my God, lemme shake yo' hand
Do it like this, do it like that
Can you switch it up? Send it right back
Frown to your back, smile to your face
Think I keep it real, but I keep it fake
Think I'm ahead, but I'm the ass
Man I'm really sick, I really need a mask
Woof!

[Hook]
And now it's in the air, spreading everywhere
So you should be prepared
(Ain't no pill or cough syrup)
(That can help so you better hurr'up)
Come on, come on, come on
Hey, hey, hey
It's in the air
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, come on, come on
Hey, hey, hey
It's in the air
Hey, hey, hey

[Pharrell]
To spread this thing, they don't need a tongue
Instead they use the precious lungs
But the scariest thing, they don't {?} kill ya
But they're still dead people dancin' like Thriller

[Shay Haley]
What's yo' name? You the one starin'
Oh my God, lemme shake yo' hand
Do it like this, do it like that
Can you switch it up? Send it right back
Frown to your back, smile to your face
Think I keep it real, but I keep it fake
Think I'm ahead, but I'm the ass
Man I'm really sick, I really need a mask
Woof!

[Hook]
And now it's in the air, spreading everywhere
So you should be prepared
(Ain't no pill or cough syrup)
(That can help so you better hurr'up)
Come on, come on, come on
Hey, hey, hey
It's in the air
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, come on, come on
Hey, hey, hey
It's in the air
Hey, hey, hey

[Pharrell]
They comin' in, they get me now
What a shitstorm of the situation
But a maid and I, guns to the biggest cloud
Stop big brother and there's invasion (yeah) come on

[Shay Haley]
What's yo' name? You the one starin'
Oh my God, lemme shake yo' hand
Do it like this, do it like that
Can you switch it up? Send it right back
Frown to your back, smile to your face
Think I keep it real, but I keep it fake
Think I'm the head, but I'm the ass
Man I'm really sick, I really need a mask
Woof!

[Hook]
And now it's in the air, spreading everywhere
So you should be prepared
(Ain't no pill or cough syrup)
(That can help so you better hurr'up)
Come on, come on, come on
Hey, hey, hey
It's in the air
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, come on, come on
Hey, hey, hey

Hey, hey, hey

[Pharrell]

Hello? I miss you
All my Mexican girls, it's a new day
Life is, life as you know it can change

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
I want it
Oh, I'm not even gonna lie (I want it)
It's an everyday dream, every sigh (I want it)
Even if it makes me cry (I want it)
I've got to have it or I'll die (I want it)
Does your family even care? (I want it)
Oh, did they tell you I'd be there? (I want it)
I've gotta get this for my team (I want it)
Just tell yourself this was my dream

[Hook]
Victory, I can smell it in the air
In my mind it surrounds me everywhere, errrre
But what a wondrous occasion, this could be (it would be)
In fact I know it will, 'cause this is my victory

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
I want it
This is something you can't buy (I want it)
Oh, don't you get it nothing else will satisfy? (I want it)
Even worse than someone that would lie (I want it)
But only a champion would qualify (I want it)
Oh, to be in the books of history (I want it)
Oh, look page one hundred, this is me (I want it)
They'll say I changed things officially (I want it)
And so these were the words to my speech

[Hook]
Victory, I can smell it in the air (in the air)
In my mind it surrounds me everywhere
But what a wondrous occasion, this could be
In fact I know it will, 'cause this is my victory

[Pharrell Outro]
Oh, the limit's the sky
The limit is the sky
The limit is the sky
The limit is the sky
It's the sky
The limit is the sky
Ah, don't you be afraid!
SKYYYYYYYYYY!
The limit is the sky
The limit is the sky
The limit is the sky
Go for it, go forth and try
The limit is, the sky
Good luck
Revolution!

Yeah

[Verse 1 - Pharrell]
All I know is I can't get the recipe
For how to make my pie taste just like the dream
Oh it's so revealing, a feeling I don' have no feeling
But I bet they tell you don't worry 'bout it just add the cream

[Hook]
AND THEN YOU FEEL GOOD! (3X)
LET IT GO AND YOU SHOULD FEEL GOOD!
Here we go...!

[Verse 2 - Pharrell]
How does every man endure the heckling?
Every phone, internet, and TV selling pie {*ka-ching*}
Tell me the type of pie it is, that's your vision buying it (hey!)
Don't bother with hello, just say bye

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Shay Haley]
Here we go, here we go
Uhh, uhh
Hello, how are you-ah?
Just stopped a second on my cruiser
Nice to meet ya, wanna recruit ya
To the muffin girls of the future
Let me school ya, and renew ya
(Free your mind!) Hallelujah
First I move ya, then go through ya
When I do yaaa...

[Hook] - "here we go"

[Outro]
ALL MY MUFFINS!
Oo ah, oo-oo ah (8X)

[Intro]
Yeah... uh
All the ladies on the floor
Damn right

[Pharrell]
I hate the fact that you know
I hate the fact that you know (why)
I hate the fact that you know, that everywhere you go
They recognize yo' jeans, they recognize a Queen (why)
Everybody runnin' but they don't know where to go
There's such a commotion right there on the flo' (dance)
You're spinnin' yo' body, the witness makes an O
Well there's one detail that's killin' me, I want to know (what)

[Hook]
You just know it, don'tcha know it, don'tcha
No chick got nothin on you
You just know it, don'tcha know it, don'tcha
Cause everything just comes to you

[Interlude]
Ay... cut it out
But

[Pharrell]
Where the hell have you been?
Oh where the hell you been? (where)
Where the hell you been, what'cha got yourself in
Baby figure's trouble, came to squeeze me in - ohh!
Everybody runnin but they don't know where to go (ay girl)
There's such a commotion right there on the flo' (want a drink?)
You're spinnin' yo' body, the witness makes an O (c'mon)
Well there's one detail that's killin' me, I want to know (what)

[Hook]


You kissed me, I kissed her
She kissed you, you kissed me
You kissed me, I kissed her
She kissed you, you kissed me

[Over the repeat]
Ohhh! Yes
Where's your drink at girl?

[]
She kissed me, I kissed her
You kissed you, you kissed me
She kissed me, I kissed her
You kissed you, you kissed me

[Over the repeat]
C'mon you're fakin'
Let's fill that up, c'mon
HOLD UP!

[Shay Haley]
Just got off and I'm tryin' to hang
A hole in the wall and my favorite drink
Put a hole in somethin' and tear it out the frame
Now who came here to partyyyy?
Get it girl, go on and get wild
What's that dance? I love your style
Animal ass, shorty get wild
But I love how you move your body

[Pharrell]
Everybody runnin' but they don't know where to go (stop!)
There's such a commotion right there on the flo'
You're spinnin' yo' body, the witness makes an O (hey girl)
Well there's one detail that's killin' me, I want to know (c'mere mama)

[Hook]

[Over Hook]
Let's take a shot together
I like your smile
Don't get gassed though, ha
Hahahahaha, yeah
Ay... ahhh!

[Verse 1]
Changed your mind
I made you live a lover's life
Changed your mind about all guys
No kiss at the end of the night
But it bewilders me
When I'm sure that you can see
So when I ask you, "How you think it'd be?"
Just when I thought you would say to me... No!

[Hook]
You keep me locked away
You don't want to admit
About me and you
Hey! But I don't care, 'cause
You make life worth living
You make love worth giving
You make time worth spending
Well why ain't we worth admitting?

[Verse 2]
When you were in my arms
Though inside I could see the stars
As if they were not far
I read what they were sayin'
They said the world is yours
With her you make it better
So imagine you two together
It'd be so amazing

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey but what if you
Miraculously feel what I do
Our split up can't beat us two
It's like you speak in invisible proof
And you're writing the same
Except you swap our names
Trying to figure out this weird ass game
And you're like real confused, shit

[Hook]

[Outro: Pharrell Williams & Spymob]
Locked away
Me and you
Living

Spending
Admitting

[Intro]
Let's be rebellious baby

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
No turnin' back now
I'm already sold on it
You came and convinced me

Thank God the teenagers takin' over the world
And all you old school niggas should just go fishing for pearls

[Pre-Chorus]

Well get on up and jam y'all

[Chorus]
I came to jam tonight
And I came to party
Well I come to jam tonight
Life makes me horny

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
They talk about yesterday
But I'm just thinkin 'bout tonight
Don't take it no kind of way
But I just wanna dance alright
Thank God the teenagers takin' over the world
And all you yesterday people should stay in your bed and curl

[Pre-Chorus]
I came to sweat
I came to sweat
I came to sweat
Well get on up and jam y'all

[Chorus]
I came to jam tonight
And I came to party
Well I come to jam tonight (Haha, yeah)
Life makes me horny (Uh, damn right)

[Verse 3: Shay Haley]
I am a ten-to-five
I am a happy dryer
Your uphill makes my mouth dry
C'mon let's wash saliva
Don't you wanna feel some love
Everybody is high on drugs
Got problems with some wookie
I am the nookie piper

[Pharrell Williams]
Thank God the teenagers takin over the world
And when you open up your eyes I hope you old fucks just hurl

[Pre-Chorus]
Look here
I came to sweat

You ain't seen nothin yet

Well get on up and jam y'all

[Chorus]

And I came to party
Well I come to jam tonight
Life makes me horny

[Q-Tip - Intro] (Pharrell)
To the, uh to the ah, um um ah

To the, uh to the ah, um um ah
To the, uh to the ah, um um ah

[Common]
Do-do-da-dom-ga-dom (AHH!)
HEY!

[Common]
She move, she move, I like the way she
Turn around but somehow still face me
A sweet girl, a-ah, ah, was tasty
For the cash, she dash like Stacy
Said she wanna move from there
On some Lil Jon shit, all she knew was "Yeah!"
...Told her act like you know
Pimpin the game, havin' to act like a ho
Inside she was black as a 'fro
Sheen of a queen on a booty shake scene
Seen with a chick, a dude to make green
Change colors, change cities, change dreams
You can be in the game but you need to change teams
We both all papers so we in the same genes
It'll pop, you ain't gotta go mainstream
So get with this rebel things and let's move

[Hook: Pharrell]
Hey mista, look at your girl...I housed her...
And she gon' fuck now, don't you know that?
I housed her... (Don't you know that?)
I housed her... (Don't you know that?!)
I housed her... (nigga)
And she gon' fuck now

[Mos Def]
AHHHH-OWWW!! And that's how I feel
You ain't checkin your dame, then I will
She got a secret that her body cain't hold
She got close to the bass and let it go-ah
High tide, everlasting {?} flow-a
Set that down on freak radio-ah
Push it up 'til her antenna show-ah
Horny out nipple stereo, AH!
What it is, where ya at? Here we go-AH!
Double-dare, ante up, tally-ho -ah!
Lights down, lights up mirror bulb - ah!
Super duper fly, supernatural - ah!
Hips in a twist, thighs on her work - ah!
Starin past her room, actin like you know - ah
Like you want some, here we go ma

[*Mos Def panting*] (DAMN!)

[Hook: Pharrell]
Hey mista, look at your girl...I housed her...
And she gon' fuck now, don't you know that?
I housed her... (Don't you know that?)
I housed her... (Don't you know that?!)
I housed her... (nigga)
And she gon' fuck now

[Posdnuos] (Dave)
AIYYO!! - You must feel well-rested
From all the sleepin in on the fact
That yo' lady's in-vested..
Into the mind games boarded at - myself
But wealth's not the reason
It's my poor if you any (hardly)
Oddly enough for wantin to get in between her
Like dots between them letters N.E. - (R.D.!)
Huh, she just wanna be free
Submerge herself completely within
(Sweat) on the floor from Alpha to End
Lend me yo' ears, my countrymen
Cause this city boy has no fears
Rep NY everyday, all year
But I rep in the name of my love for how you're movin
The chance of you backin it UP, to make me..

[Dave] (Posdnuos)
Hey yo, beat it, boardwalk! She ain't property
Parked her place in my Monopoly
"Sixteen Candles", she blew me in my birthday suit
I wouldn'ta thawed her with that bracelet star
Asics on, she a little athletic
But he's goaltendin (swat for shots)
Playin the mind games (wantin to watchin meeeeeeee...)
She that Ultra Mag and OTAG
Spray can sexy (Psss! Psss!)
The colors got gang niggas callin the truth (PSSSS!)
Make a madman go chase the life
And vacate his faith and go browse the proof
But your shops got gates in front, the basic hunt
Your ligaments thicker than possum meat
You possibly, define a one-night stand
But I won't know, because of your man 

[*dog barks*]

[Hook: Pharrell]
Hey mista, look at your girl...I housed her...
And she gon' fuck now, don't you know that?
I housed her... (Don't you know that?)
I housed her... (Don't you know that?!)
I housed her... (nigga)
And she gon' fuck now

[Q-Tip]
Escort your honeydip to the Native Tongues show
She's a Abstract freak, and you didn't even know
The lights go down, her body hits the ground
Clearly she's affected by the Q-Tip method
Her Jungle Brothers shirt is the symbol of her heart
How much you wanna bet more than her brow was wet
How far you gonna go to block the lady flow
She just wanna move, unless you bust her groove
I didn't even mention that the tail is Titanic
I didn't wink back when she winked, so don't panic
Pretty Guinevere with her hands in the air
One more drink, ma should fuckin stay there
Don't be the jelly bean whose color turns green
Be the proud man, let go of her hand *woof*
Let her get more to the four on the floor
To the, "Um, chicka, ah da um, um, da ah!"

[Hook: Pharrell]
Hey mista, look at your girl...I housed her...
And she gon' fuck now, don't you know that?
I housed her... (Don't you know that?)
I housed her... (Don't you know that?!)
I housed her... (nigga)
And she gon' fuck now
Hey mista, look at your girl...I housed her...
And she gon' fuck now, don't you know that?
I housed her... (Don't you know that?)
I housed her... (Don't you know that?!)
I housed her... (nigga)
And she gon' fuck now

[Pharrell]
Yo
(Love hurts, hurts) Yo...Yo
(Love hurts, hurts) I don't know how to understand you
(Love hurts, hurts, hurts) You won't give me a chance
(Love hurts, hurts) (C'mon)
(Love hurts, hurts) Yo, turn me up a little bit
(Love hurts, hurts, hurts) I gotta talk to her
(Love hurts, hurts, hurts) Yeah
(Love hurts, hurts, hurts) Hey, baby

[Verse 1]
You don't have to have those beautiful eyes
Or that... beautiful skin (So pretty)
You don't have to walk that way (Oooh)
Or be extraordinarily thin (You're the dopest, baby)
You don't have to be a supermodel (Wish you weren't)
To... be my girl (The whole world knows you)
Or would I be a over-indulgence
And just... make you hurl

[Hook]
(What's wrong with me) (Yo...)
What's wrong with me, yeah, yeah, yeah (Why can't I be with you)
Why can't we be, yeah
(You don't know what you do to me, I can feel you all over)

Now look-a-here

[Verse 2]
Now when I first met you (Damn)
You, you never asked what I drove (You didn't ask about none of my cars)
You told me I was beautiful (Thank you baby)
Girl... and you ignored my clothes (Ignored my clothes...)
Heaven only knows, knows, knows (Heaven only knows, the Lord knows)
That you're the faceless girl of my dreams (Yeah...)
Hey, but what's so weird (Crazy, crazy)
I've seen you all along in magazines (You're all over the place, baby)
What's wrong with me

[Hook]
What's wrong with me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Why can't we be, yeah, yeah (What's wrong with me...)
What's wrong with me, yeah, yeah (C'mon, c'mon; c'mon baby)
How long will it... be, yeah (C'mon)

[Verse 3]
Every once in a while I'll hear from you
Which illuminates my day (So bright, baby, so bright)
What's so scary I'm not, I'm not in love with you baby
But I'm preventably on my way
If I could remove all the lights from the world
For an... experiment for me
(Let me show you something), you'd learn that
When in the dark, if you use your heart (C'mon, c'mon)
You'd, you'd most certainly see (Look here)
That I'm the one for you

[Hook] with "Wooo, wooo" in background
What's wrong with me, yeah, yeah, yeah (Ohhhh) (What's wrong with me...)
Why can't we be, yeah

[Breakdown] (music changes)
I don't get it
You mean so much me
What's wrong, am I too demanding?
Listen
I just wanna feel you
I just wanna touch you
Please be mine (What's wrong, baby)
You'll be my breakfast every morning

[Hook in background becomes distorted]
I'll eat you (What's wrong with me)
You'll be my lunch, I'll eat you (Why can't we be)
You'll be my dinner, I'll eat you
(Oooh-oooh, Oooh-oooh, what's wrong with me)
What's wrong with me, baby (What's wrong with me)
I'll eat you on the rocks
I'll do it better than any of those (How long will it... be)
I'll do it better than your ex-boyfriend
I'll do it better than that bitch you're sleeping with now
I'll eat you (Wooo, wooo... Wooo, wooo)
What's wrong with me (Wooo, wooo... Wooo, wooo)
Huh, what's wrong with me (Wooo, wooo... Wooo, wooo)
Yeah, yeah (Wooo, wooo... Wooo, wooo)
Hey baby
I'll eat you
I'll eat you...

[Verse 1]
Little Red Riding Hood went riding on her bike
She got just a little distracted cause she seen something she liked
Just because it ain't grandma's house don't mean that it's all good
Cause no one cares if she's in there, and the wolf's still in the woods
(Beautiful losers!)
To you they might look beautiful, but they're rotten in the inside
(Beautiful losers!)
When there's so much dirt up under the cupboard
There's a big ol' lump that can't hide, c'mon
Here they go again, wearing disguises as your best friend
Watch the bullets ricochet, off of the armor like
Blam-ba-blam, blam-ba-blam, hey hey
You know they won't secede, you know relentless they will be
You should tell 'em clear the way
And tell 'em to step back, back-ba-back, hey hey

[Chorus]
Kill joy, kill joy, a kill joy, a kill joy
Watch them bullets ricochet like
Blam-ba-blam, blam blam, ba-blam-blam, a kill joy
Everybody let's go!

[Verse 2]
Think back when you've met them, you'll see it in their glances
That's the seed, that led to trees, which eventually led to branches
Cold as a snowball, downhill to avalanches
Believe you me when the world is coldest when the devil does his dances
(Beautiful losers!)
Don't you wonder why you always end up in last? Uh
(Beautiful losers!)
Well I would bet you anything that it's karma from your past, c'mon
Wake up little boy, there's no spaceship here employed
They zapped that shit away, like
Damn-da-damn, damn-da-damn, hey hey
You're impoverished at your knees
But you gotta stand up and face the fees
And that's when you say, give the shoulder a
Dap-ta-dap, dap-ta-dap, hey hey

[Chorus]
Kill joy, kill joy, a kill joy, a kill joy
Watch them bullets ricochet like
Blam-ba-blam, blam blam, ba-blam-blam, a kill joy
Everybody, let's go!

[Outro]
Everybody, let's go!
"Kill Joy, an N-E-R-D film starring you!
Also starring, him, color provided by "Seeing Sounds"
Goodnight, aw!"

[Verse 1]
You made me take a look at me
At all the flaws and what could be
And all the things that you would reap
Was hidden in me, I didn't wanna see, what was troublin me

[Interlude]
You brought your sledgehammer, comin down with the BOOM
I mean I fell in love, cause I'm inside of you
I mean I love your heart, but it's your mind if I had to choose
You're smilin at me smokin, but you are not amused

[Hook]
Someday I'll laugh about it
All that pressure stashed behind it
Couldn't it last like that? I doubt it
But c'mon girl, let's laugh about it

[Repeat Hook]

[Verse 2]
The way you see the world is neat
You're in the sun and cloudy peaks
Please be my friend, oh would you please?
But you're still on the move, smoke comin from your shoes
Meanwhile I'm still bruised

[Interlude] + 

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Let's just have a blast about it (ohh, some day)
Couldn't never found our paths without it (laugh about it)
All the bullshit that surrounds it (ohh, some day)
Let's just have a laugh about it (laugh about it)
And I can never lose those memories
Because you're screamin from the clouds, goin out
The color from those painted these melodies
In fact I'm dreamin 'bout it now, UHH~!

[Breakdown: Pharrell & Shay Haley]
Girl no! (Ay, you need to rethink this)
Girl no! (I mean, we been through too much)
Girl no! (And our friendship means everything)
(You know we can't take that much time) Girl no!
(But I can't stop us from bein friends)

[Hook] with ad libs

[Pharrell]
First they say the angels sing, and then, the big bang
That was the first day, there's six more
From organisms to single cells, mutate, to shells
Then mutate into spores

On dry land (dry land)
Where the living scream die man (die man)
Awwwwww

By the seventh day, he rested as he looked at them
Those made, those, men

Guess it's safe to say that they don't know
Since they not alone, and there's no dusk or dawn
As they never washed ashore, but of course, what for?
Who cares what lies beyond

On dry land (dry land)
Where the living scream die man (die man)
Awwwwww
They see our boats, and say oh no not them again
And scream swim, just, swim

So while the federal buildings blow, below, fish glow
How lovely that must be
You shoulda listened to Jacques Costeau, don't say, you know
Stop sending your trash to sea

Leave it on the dry land (dry land)
Where the living scream die man (die man)
Awwwwww

He made this world, took it and gave it back again
And we learned, no-thing
(Nothing, we, we learned nothing right?)

[Verse 1]
The summer's gone too soon
The winter's coming out
And lives are falling and, I'm just bawling
You had me going out of my head!
And I look stupid
The pain was gruesome
We're deep for awhile, and then in heat for awhile
But there's no need for you now, because I'm free of you now
You see I'm

[Hook]
Happy (happy!)
Things are lookin good now (good now)
I feel so alive (SO A-LIVE)
I'm on overdrive (overdrive)
I'm killin it, I'm killin it
I'm good, I'm good, don't try coming back
I'm good, I'm good, cause I will not be there
I'm good, I'm good, it's not like you ever cared

[Verse 2]
Smiles would die too soon
Our days were filled with frowns
My job was calling, my life was falling
My friends said I looked like I was dead
Did I look stupid!
Oh damn you Cupid
You were shooting at me, instead it landed on her
If this is how it should be
We should have stayed how we were
Cause now I'm

[Hook]
Happy (happy!)
Things are lookin good now (good now)
I feel so alive (SO A-LIVE)
I'm on overdrive (overdrive)
I'm killin it, I'm killin it
I'm good, I'm good, don't try coming back
I'm good, I'm good, cause I will not be there
I'm good, I'm good, it's not like you ever cared

[Verse Three]
Damn you're stupid~!
How'd you lose it?
You had it all, but you treated it wrong
You've got some things to resolve, so I requested this song
Hey I'm just

[Hook]
Happy (happy!)
Things are lookin good now (good now)
I feel so alive (SO A-LIVE)
I'm on overdrive (overdrive)
I'm killin it, I'm killin it
I'm good, I'm good, don't try coming back
I'm good, I'm good, cause I will not be there
I'm good, I'm good, it's not like you ever cared

[Verse 1]
Sitting here in this white padded room
Imagining I'm a meteor flying out through the distant space
How does tiny speckle Earth destroy tommorow?
So capable of so many things, why make life taking planes?
But I believe that when you lose your route
Choose the sunlight, it could be your guide
No more political dreams, not another excuse
Don't need another love song, we need a love bomb

[Chorus]
To just blow us away, to freaking blow the lights out
Turning night to day, hear it from miles away
Just to make it right now, fuck what the government say
We gotta save some lives now, is that okay?

[Verse 2]
Can't you see? This is "The Truman Show", baby
Cause when they fight, who dies is you
Hold, if you unscrew me, we've got the same gear and same tools
But how you gon' catch it witcha head hanging down?
Whatcha see staring at the ground?
But I believe, even without a clue
You've got sunlight, and it can be your guide
No more political dreams, not another excuse
Don't need another love song, we need a love bomb

[Chorus]
To just blow us away, to freaking blow the lights out
Turning night to day, hear it from miles away
Just to make it right now, fuck what the government say
We gotta save some lives now, is that okay?

[Bridge]
I'm trying to unbind a few
By removing propaganda but
They must have used the devil's superglue
I'm trying to take the machine apart, yeah
What I'm simply trying to do
Is have the reason to take a pause
I've been down every avenue
But everybody's building's gone

[Chorus]
To just blow us away, to freaking blow the lights out
Turning night to day, hear it from miles away
Just to make it right now, fuck what the government say
We gotta save some lives now, is that okay?

[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Hey!

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Hey, I'm a little teapot short and stout
There's some shake up in around me, know it's talking about
I pop the lid, the lid, it's gon' be me, I'm gonna let it out
Nothing'll hap' if I don't open my mouth
I ain't a punk bitch, I don't give a fuck
I'm just being me and speaking from the gut
Well it's a little bit of us, a whole lot of you
And we just came here to see what it do

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I'm right here, and I ain't going nowhere
You can turn tables and you can throw chairs
I'm right here, and I ain't going nowhere
You can knock doors and tear gas the air so
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to

[Verse 2: Shay Haley]
I'm a little teapot, blowing off steam
You put me on the heat, I don't whistle, I scream
Bang (bow!), bang (bow!), fuck a bed fuck a dream
This is rage blowing up your machine
I'm a star, bitch, I don't give a fuck
Don't be surprised when this bitch start blowing up
Well it's a little bit of us, a whole lot of you
And we just came here to see what it do

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I'm right here, and I ain't going nowhere
You can turn tables and you can throw chairs
I'm right here, and I ain't going nowhere
You can knock doors and tear gas the air so
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
And now I'm waking up, laying in the ambulance bed
With something in my arm (I gotta get it off)
And tied to it, a line that'll read your mind
And next is your mind (I gotta get it off)
The shit they spray attack my lungs everyday
With a creeping decay (I gotta get it off)
By attacking these things, I earned my wings
And my halo but first I gotta get it off

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I'm right here, and I ain't going nowhere
You can turn tables and you can throw chairs
I'm right here, and I ain't going nowhere
You can knock doors and tear gas the air so
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to
I'm right here, and I ain't going nowhere
You can turn tables and you can throw chairs
I'm right here, and I ain't going nowhere
You can knock doors and tear gas the air so
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to

[Intro]
Hohhhh-ah
Hohhhhhhhh

[Verse 1]
At first it started with the eyes
I'm like uh-uh, no way, yo sister, can't no
And so the tension slowly build
You got them slanted eyes that kills, all systems go
Then you kissed my cheek, my knees get weak
My heart just skipped a beat, so I just froze
Then you touch me there, I knew you would, and
Girl, you touched me good, I'm like uhh-oh
Ohhhhhh girl

[Hook]
Know what, know what, know what, you know what?
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
It hurts me, it hurts you, it hurts me, what you do
Was so good, so good, so good, so good

[Verse 2]
Let me show you where you went wrong
You know that our sex took us to and fro
Then you had the nerve to say you're hurt
And fix your mouth to blame the Cuervo
Then in me you couldn't find a compromise
And I'm just like, 'you know what you chose'
I don't want to say it again, but here it goes
Fuck it, we're just friends, now where's my clothes?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
What am I gon' do when I can't get anymore
I'd rather not know oh
Cause if you wanna know the truth
Nobody made me cum like you, I just roll over
I can't let my mind think of you
I hit that dial and get you on the phone
Cause baby it's just not the physical
I get with you I'm addicted to your moan

[Hook]

[Bridge]
The rumors (3X)
This ain't right (you know it's so)
You know I want it (you know it's so)
You know I want it (you know it's so
(You know it)
Girl this ain't right (you know it too)
You know I want it (you know it too)
You know I want it
(I'm mad at you)

[Verse 4]
You try keep your feelings inside the ropes
But then you weigh me down when you see me like hey hello!
Now you know we never cared of a public place
I see it in your face and those were magnific' times don't go
How we gon' stop?

[Hook]

[Outro] x2
Your friendship means the most to me

[Intro]
Uh-oh!

[Verse 1]
Every single night I'm starin in her window
(Win-dow-dow-dow, dow da dow)
She's fresh in a towel and the lights are dimmed low
(Win-dow-dow-dow, dow da dow)
If you seen, what I've seen, she's a ten yo
(Win-dow-dow-dow, dow da dow)
You would be (ahhhhh) starin in her window
(The eyes are the win-dows to the soul)
You would be (ahhhhh) starin' in her window!

Uh-oh!

[Verse 2]
My best friend said I shouldn't do this no more
(Win-dow-dow-dow, dow da dow)
Well I guess that means I'm very different from my friends so
(Win-dow-dow-dow, dow da dow)
Cause you've seen, what I've seen, she's a ten yo
(Win-dow-dow-dow, dow da dow)
You would be (ahhhhh) starin in her window
(The eyes are the win-dows to the soul)
You would be (ahhhhh) starin' in her window!
Uh-oh!

[Interlude - repeat 2X]
Win-dow-dow-dow, dow da dow!

[Verse 3]
Look at her, she's my medicine
In those magazines, and all that estrogen
I bet she'd like me, but my conscious says to guess again
If she ever did, I would be ready then
The best time to watch is like 1 or 2 o'clock
In my fuckin world she can come over and rock
I wonder if she'll be down with it a lot
She's taking off her clothes, and 'bout to close the win-dow

Uh-oh!

[Verse 4]
She's like the Bill to my Gates that was entitled Windows
(Win-dow-dow-dow, dow da dow)
She said "Don't go Microsoft, you like it when I bend low" (Don'tcha, don'tcha)
(Win-dow-dow-dow, dow da dow)
I said I see, what you mean, cause that's my twin-doh
(Win-dow-dow-dow, dow da dow)
And uhh, we see you starin in our windows
(The eyes are the win-dows to the soul)
Damn~! They caught me starin' in her window!

[Outro]
Uh-oh!
Uh-oh-wha-ho!
Yeah
Oh no

[Verse 1]
Yeah; I was at a show
Backstage untying my shoes
There was your friend from Wireimage
Standing beside her was you
And Nigo told me don't do it
My nice image would go up in fumes
But the head without the ears heard it
So you end up in my room

[Hook]
Textin' me a hundred times, callin' me a hundred times
Hope it is not you this time, damn I gotta change my line
Textin me you're gonna die, call the psychiatric line
Friends and family should know why, reportin' this as a crime
I bet you heard this song wanna know who I'm talkin' 'bout
I said I bet you heard this song wanna know who I'm talkin' 'bout
I bet you heard this song wanna know who I'm talkin' 'bout
I bet you heard this song wanna know who I'm talkin' 'bout--YOU!

[Repeat 2X]
Hoo-hoo
Yeah baby!

[Verse 2]
And on those frustrated nights
E-mails that could evoke tears (I like you, I like you)
(I love you, I think I'm dying)
My friend asked me for your e-mail address
She said she'd take it from here
She said she'd tried to walk you through the picture
(He doesn't like you)
But for you nothing is clear (why?)
Now she too is frustrated and damn
That's been a year

[Hook]

[Repeat 2X]
Hoo-hoo
Yeah baby!

[Interlude: Shay]
As you listen to this song
I hope your thought process evolves
It's not your reasoning that's wrong
Its that deep down everything is gone
The place is empty, no lights on
Instead happiness should be sprawled
Across the face of your heart's wall
But you'll press pause and you'll just call
{*phone dialing*} (*FUUUCK*)

[Repeat 2X]
Awww baby, you can't help yourself

[Hook]

[Repeat 2X]
Hoo-hoo
Yeah baby!

YOU~!

The saxophone makes my head hurt

[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
"Y'know, when I was a kid growing up
We used to love playing outside, riding bikes
And that was the 80's, record heatwaves
I mean people were like
Dying on the side of the road, getting heatstrokes
So the only thing you could do was go in the house and, y'know
Take a shower a couple of times a day
So, I'll never forget I was like seven years old
I closed my eyes, and that's when it started
I started seeing sounds, whoa..!"

[Refrain]
Time for some action, time for some action
Time for some action, time for some action

[Bridge: Williams]
Eh...
Yes, yes, right there
I like it, 'scuse me!
Hey...

[Verse 1: Williams]
Yeah, you know the scenario
Images circle your mind like a merry-go
If you just tunin into your stereo
Turn this bitch up, here we go

[Refrain]
Time for some action, time for some action
Time for some action, time for some action

[Verse 2: Shay Haley]
I'm more like a vulture, far from a dove
Don't you mistake this, ma, this is not love
It's lust; no cuddles and hugs
This is for floor and rugs

[Refrain]
Time for some action, time for some action
Time for some action, time for some action

[Verse 3: Williams]
Yo, the sweat on your body, it creates a scent
No liquor, no pills, only that gets me bent
I'm loving your clothes, especially the prints
Get it, the prints?

[Refrain]
Time for some action, time for some action
Time for some action, time for some action

[Verse 4: Haley]
Hey, you ain't know I was a nasty guy?
You say you wanna flash me, right?
You know only I could smash you, right?
Well alright

[Refrain]
Time for some action, time for some action
Time for some action, time for some action

[Bridge: Williams]
It's time for some action
What can you imagine?
It's time for some action
What can you imagine?
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Action!)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Action!)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Action!)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Action!)

[Interlude: Howlin' Pelle Almqvist]
I see what's going on, I've been sitting there all along
Just waiting and waiting 'cause I'm tired
(Time for some action, time for some action)
I ain't got nothing to say, nothing to do
But I've been waiting for so long
And I think, I think, I think I'm through

[Refrain]
Time for some action, time for some action
Time for some action, time for some action

[Verse One:]
To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical dooches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies
The back of the club, sippin' Moet is where you'll find me
The back of the club, mackin hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question askin', blunt passin, music blastin'
But I just can't quit
Because one of these honeys Biggie got to creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret why not?
Why blow up my spot cause we both got hot
Now check it, I got more Mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweetie I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy, I got mad friends with Benz's
C-Notes by the layers, true fuckin players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS3, I got the chronic by the tree

[Hook:]
(I love it when you call me big pop-pa] x3
Throw your hands in the air, if youse a tru playa
To the honies gettin money playin niggas like dummies
If you gun up in your waist, don't shoot up the place
Cause I see some ladies tonite that should be havin my ba-by
Baybee, uh

[Verse Two:]
Straight up honey really I'm asking
Most of these niggas think they me mackin', but they be acting
Who they attractin' with that line
"What's your name, what's your sign?"
Soon as he buy that wine, I just creep up from behind
Ask you what your interest are, who you be wit?
Things to make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while, I'm gon' call my crew
You go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around two
Or three o' clock, Lil Ceas pull the truck up out the parking lot
Roll a blunt cause he like to spark a lot
Steam on the way to the telly go fill my belly
A T-bone steak, cheese eggs, and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, cause in a few, we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right boo (truuuue)
Forget the telly, we just go to the crib
And watch a movay, in the jaccuzay, bay-bay

[Hook]

[Verse Three:]
(How does a true playa live?)
Nigga, Versace down
Donna Karan, Diamonds glarin', Niggas starin'
Now I got my pants draggin in the Benz wagon
Raggin' sippin' D.P on my way to D.C
The biggest willies, smokin' phillies
Thai & skunk together, Junior M.A.F.I.A. forever
Thuggin to say youngin and you knows that
I steps in where the Mo and the Hoes at (Baybee)
Niggas know the better on the Coogi sweater
Butter leather, chrome beretta see
You know who that nigga be

[Outro: Jermaine Dupri]
Shit you ain't know, ha ha, That's the stride for ninety-five Baby
Straight up playerlistic mentality
You just do your thing, Cause I'm definintley gone do mine
And we gon' hook up a lil later and do thing you never heard of
Can you feel me?

[Hook]

[Intro: Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh.. UHH
Yeah..
Uhh.. uhh..
Uh! Yeah.. yeah..
Uhh..
I'm on..
Fuck em.. yeah, uhh..
With my hands gripped, praise the Lord shit
Fuck her, never knew her
Screw her.. (dump her body, dump her body) sewer
Our father.. uh-huh..

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
What you expected from his next of kin
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, Glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin
Uhh, the lesson from the Smith and Wessun is depressin
Niggas keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question
How many shots does it take to make my heart stop
And my body start to shake? If I should die before I wake

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
With my hands gripped, praise the Lord shit
Our Father, if I should die before I wake
With my hands gripped, praise the Lord shit
Our Father, if I should die before I wake

[Verse 2: Black Rob]
Fluck that, snap a nigga shit, smash him with the 5th, watch his body lift
Shut his hottie's lips, bitch screamin, hit her body quick
Got me like the trifest not knowin how my life is
My life is, rap sheet long as the Turnpike
The sheistest, hey fella, who bidded with the lifers
Did it with the Glocks, spit it with your pops, you was in diapers
Loved me when you came to Rikers
Hated me all in the free cypher, mad you can't be like us
Some murderers who turn bikers, see Biggie Smalls
Recruited these snipers, alumni do it just like us
Some pied pipers, squeezin life out y'all
It's all out war, be all wild as all outdoor
If a coward got beef, y'all be checkin his palm
Paralyzin, my niggas thorough kid, how bout yours?
Real quick to screw a nigga then, pop out four
Clean the wipers, hit the party up and, hop out yours
Bitch nigga, whoah

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
With my hands gripped, praise the Lord shit
Our Father, if I should die before I wake
With my hands gripped, praise the Lord shit
Our Father, if I should die before I wake

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
Yo, when you fuckin with Mac, you fuckin with the best
I'm still going to war with them dusty Tecs
Man you know how I handle my shit, S.K. can on my shit
Jump out of vans like Hannibal Smith
Man I spit a thousand rounds, your squad don't need it
Shredders in a riot pump leave you quadriplegic
When I squeeze don't breathe keep it lined and even
So when niggas get hit, they be cryin screamin
Lyin bleedin from that iron steamin
And I ain't tryin to hear that bullshit, I ain't mean it
Niggas start bitchin, when that pistol in they face
Or I sick two pits to come and get you in your place
If I catch you in my shit, I'm wakin my bitch
Hear take this shit, crackin the brick, facin that shit
Takin two sniffs, grabbing my shit
Best believe if I get hit, y'all niggas takin some shit
Picture niggas takin my shit

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
With my hands gripped, praise the Lord shit
Our Father, if I should die before I wake
With my hands gripped, praise the Lord shit
Our Father, if I should die before I wake

[Verse 4: Ice Cube]
Niggas never thought they'd see Cube and Biggie
In the year 2000 all drunk and pissy
Off whiskey, you can miss me acting gay
He's the King of New York, I'm the King of L.A
Doin it the O.G. way, it's sorta like
The Brooklyn Way, it's just the crook in me
So this is dedicated to the memory of
The Notorious One, the glorious one
And if you go for your gun, I got to go for mine
Cock my nine and seperate your head from your spine
So, "Grab yo' dicks if you love Hip-Hop" and
Fuck you niggas that shot Big Pop'
The conspiracy of this nation for assassination
Of the young black male in this black Hell
And I can tell, no matter the weather
That you and 2Pac got your shit together
California Love

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
With my hands gripped, praise the Lord shit
Our Father, if I should die before I wake
With my hands gripped, praise the Lord shit
Our Father, if I should die before I wake

[Intro: Lil' Cease]
Queen Bee, and The Notorious B.I.G. nigga
The best that ever lived, the best that ever did it
The best that ever lived it
Cocksuckers, what's his name, huh? (Biggie)
That's how we do it y'all
To all my niggas in the house
Bad Boy, who we die for? (Biggie)
All day, everyday nigga

[Verse 1: Lil' Cease]
For the love of B.I.G., we bang out
Since my man died, we don't hang out
We blow brains out, we tear the club up pullin' things out
Mafia World, all my niggas max out
We Bad Boys, why ya'll niggas cracked out
Coward niggas, most are burried down south
Far from gangstas, really hush puppies
Niggas bearly speak when we discuss money
Niggas stay yappin when there's always somethin' funny
The realest niggas never took nuthin from me
Rock ice, stay jig, fuck with niggas that got drunk, and hate kids
Got niggas on state bids, that hate movies like Rosewood and Matrix
Ayo, Biggie taught me well
Biggie told me how to flip bricks like cartwheel

[Chorus: Lil' Cease & Notorious B.I.G.]
To all my thugs who puffed him
To all my girls who hugged him
You love him, yell his name (Biggie)
I'd rather die on my feet, than live on my knees
Nigga please, I cock and squeeze for (Biggie) Mafia
Representin' Bucktown
Mack 11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Face down, you know the routine, the cream
Earrings, you know the drama Biggie bring

[Verse 2: Larceny]
For B.I.G., I learn to grip aim and cock it
Once I got it, I lock it
Banger, big city boy with deep pockets
See me speak, that paper better be the topic
I like my ice frozen like the Antartic
I'm quick to finish it, your good to start it
And with the flashy colors on, you just a target, Waitin for a hard hit
I like marine blue, marine green, roll with a mean team
Meshed out, fresh out, and stay greams
We big boys, we do big things, born in this county of kings
I ain't got shit, I spread things, take things
Fuck whenever my mood swings, from the summer for the winter to the spring
My nigga ill's holdin it down for the beam
Like BIG said, we do the real things, we still bubble and steal chains
Still tustle, still struggle, we feel pain
Still ride, still die for BIG's name

[Chorus: Lil' Cease & Notorious B.I.G.]
To all my thugs who puffed him
To all my girls who hugged him
You love him, yell his name chorusBiggie
I'd rather die on my feet, than live on my knees
Nigga please, I
Ock and squeeze f (Biggie) Mafia
Representin' Bersecktown
Mack 11'  cocked back, niggas better duck down
Face down, you know the routine, the cream
Earrings, you know the drama Biggie bring
For BIG I grip the Sig, put six in your wig
Not cause of what he said, 'cause of what he did
When I hear that pop quiz, that's the way I was raised
And that's the way it is for (Biggie)
We roll like the Panthers, show our guns on camera
Do jokes with police scanners, niggas mediocre, full of dirt like hampers
I roll with a bunch of niggas that wear bandanas and rep
We kept it thurough, from the heart ripped the barrel
B.K. style, see B.I.G. howl, now
Lets see who, wanna go against Mafia world
Niggas nuthin' but squirrels, they know we rep
Niggas tryin to get a nut, hit in the head or below the gut
Wood style roll'em up, get plucked, nigga what?!
Go back to spend a ton, and know cats wit gold tooths
Know my gat and bust for my nigga (Biggie)

[Chorus: Lil' Cease & Notorious B.I.G.]
To all my thugs who puffed himsTo all my girls who hugged him
You love him, yell his name (Biggie)
I'd rat
Er die on my feet, than live on my knees
Nigga please, I cock and squeeze fL (Biggie) Mafia
Representin' Bil' cktown
Mack 11'K cocked back, niggas better duck down
Face down, you know the routine, the cream
Earrings, you know the drama Biggie bring
Now Verse 4: when I cock back and squeeze, my Desert E'z
Make you drop to your knees, barely able to breathe
My bullets move in threes, one for Brook-lyn
One for Mafia so take that, Uh, and this one's for...
You know Frank kept me iced out
Mink dragon, seven figures in my bank account
All that material shit, ya'll still tryin to get it
Uh, you fuckin pricks, get off his dick tryin to be like...
All ya'll lame ass niggas keep my man name out your mouth
Or get this shit right, check it, it's the B-I-double G-I-E
Ya'll niggas can't see Poppa, nor the Big Momma
Who you love... for the Y2G, the two ten
We got it sewn, we don't need ya'll help, we hold our own
Cause this goes out to cats not tryin to give it up
B.I.G. lives in us, shout him out

[Chorus: Lil' Cease & Notorious B.I.G.]

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
Venue after venue I've been through
Come up to the telly so I can bend you (Uh)
Send you to the store, condoms and more
Jealous females call you sluts and whores
Could it be my hardcore metaphor
Makes sweat pour on the bedroom floor? (Uh)
Open up the Lex door, jump on in
I'm kinda tired, I'ma roll blunts while you spin
You got your license, right? Alright, no swerving
Hair blonde out, Madonna style like a virgin (Uh)
Splurging, Dom P., Rose
Much foreplay, that's my forte
Niggas see the ring, baguettes to death (Uh)
She looking for a man, honey, he just left
Violate me, he get beat to death
Goodfellas squeeze every shell they got left (Uh)
Grand Marnier increase the don strength
Two four-fifths within my arms length
With a calm breath I say, "We got to float"
Throw Little Cease the keys to the boat
Tongue all down her throat, you know the routine
Got my dick large like Bruce Springsteen
And you mean too (Uh), eyes greenish blue
Got the Coogi sweater with the bubble Fubu
Beautiful, that's how the night goes
Get out them tight clothes, get in some night clothes
I invite those girls that smoke lah (Uh)
Keep it real with you, you keep it real with I
We be tight like frog's ass
Have you screamin', "Biggie, Biggie, give me one more chance"
What?

[Chorus: Puff Daddy]
Would you ride with me? (Yeah)
Would you lie for me? (That's right)
Would you get high with me? (For sure)
Would you die for me? (No doubt)
Would you ride with me? (Yeah)
Would you lie for me? (That's right)
Would you get high with me? (For sure)
Would you die for me? (No doubt)

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
These hoes don't treat you like I treat you
Like my contacts, I can see right through
Don't they know me and you is stuck like glue?
Queen Bitch means number one and two
Wifey, ya'll ain't got to like me
Go head and act dumb, you'll just catch a hot one
Y'all know where I'm from
Bucktown, lay your ass down
You don't wanna play around (With me)
Probably just mad because Frank chose me
A fly cutie, you just a groupie
Girls call my telephone just to hang up
While me and you is in the crib, laying up
Oh, he ain't tell you that we live together, huh?
And that we gonna have a kid together?
Whatever, me intimidated, never
Anything you give to him, he give it right to Kim
Anyway, I fuck better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
If I fuck another nigga, it don't mean nothing
B.I.G. is in my heart from the start
Whether broke or rich, I'm a stay his bitch
Chicks who used to be around, where they at now?
See I don't care bout them other broads
B.I.G. kept it real with me, and that's that

[Chorus: Puff Daddy]
Would you ride with me? (Yeah)
Would you lie for me? (That's right)
Would you get high with me? (For sure)
Would you die for me? (No doubt)
Would you ride with me? (Yeah)
Would you lie for me? (That's right)
Would you get high with me? (For sure)
Would you die for me? (No doubt)

Yeah, ninety-six, for my Nostrand Ave niggas
My Fulton Street niggas (hardcore for ninety-six)
Dangerous MC's

Uhh (Check it out) uhh
Diamonds on my neck, chrome drop-top
Chillin' on the scene, smokin' pounds of green
Oooh-wee, you see, the ugliest
Money-hungriest, Brooklyn Loch Ness
Nine millimeter cock test, wan fi' test?
And the winner is...

[Busta Rhymes]
Y'all niggas know the rules
I blast on niggas so --

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
-- my fist never bruise
Land-still-cruise, Frank White paid his dues
Ask who's the raw, bet they say Poppa very
Look forward to me like commissary
All of a sudden, now every-body Big Willie
Done did it, come widdit, get yo' head splitted
Or get your neck slitted, admit it, you overdid it
Your shit it, just ain't got that LOUD
Gold tooth shine like TaaDow!
Biggie Smalls the illest and how, phrase raise your eyebrow
By now you figure, he talkin' bout that nigga
But your weak-ass assumptions, lead led to dumpin'
IV to pump-in, you're feeling something
Catch my drift, or catch my four-fifth lift
At least six inches, above project fences
Turn meat to minces, jumps turn to flinches
When I rain I drenches, cleared your park benches (HAH)
Missed you by pinches (HOO) your talk is senseless (RRUFF)
Actor needs chiropractor (HAH, HOO) for cracked jaw
Yes, I rocked your chatterbox (Hah)
Dangerous you're not I gets down (HOO)
Twist your body {*singing*} round and round, upside down

[Verse 2: Mark Curry]
Uh-huh, make money hand over fist
The bo-vines roam where chickenhearts don't exist
Settin' up shop, it's hands on in the hustle
Fakes don't kill nuttin' but time and don't tussle
The process of elimination, fresh rotation
Come and go and they death be starvation
In the heat of battle it's no rest for the weary
Snooze and you lose is the theory
The theory of a patient man, is wild beyond belief
Be afraid, you don't want beef with us chief
Your talk is cheap and the supply meets demand
Everything you can imagine is real man
And revenge be the dish I serve to cats cold
Stay up on about ten folds, you know how it goes
You know the streets and it's real as shit, c'mon
Niggas grab your dicks, c'mon

Follow me, I slip em slide em rip em ride em provide em

Point a pistol at you bitch niggas, BLA-DOW

Most of my niggas cuckoo, easy to gas to shoot you
Even all of them Haitian niggas won't believe this voodoo
Can yo' pussy be chaka, don't let me speak in pat-ois
And kick you in your face like we playin' a game of soc-cer
I love to cock the Glock-a, stack up on loot and vod-ka
And fuck your crew because all of y'all niggas full of ca-ca
The way we doin' damage tell me how the fuck you manage
With my niggas who marinate on foul thoughts and think savage
Them niggas'll throw you in a manhole
And push they hand in yo' ass
And pull yo' head right out yo' asshole!
Parkay nigga we rugged all day nigga
You ready to fuck bitch? Fuck the foreplay nigga
This me for all consumers, my nigga FUCK the rumors

Beeotch!

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
I got a bitch that suck my dick 'til I nut
Spit it on my gut and slurp that shit back up
Ain't that a slut (HELL YEA) she even take it in the butt
Fuck for 'bout a hour, now she want a golden shower
You didn't know that we be pissin' on hoes, bitch (BEOTCH)
Luke and Biggie straight shittin on hoes, bitch (BEOTCH)
Lick your toes, bitch? (BEOTCH) Fuck no, you must be crazy
Squirt in your face and then I'm Swayze (Bitch)
Recognize G, straight up, I can't knock y'all
After Big Poppa, fuck all of Junior M.A.F.I.A
The whole clique, dick sucked, ass licked
Leave your number by the phone, bring yo' ass on home
I roam in Lexuses and Benzes, the fly way
With the flyest bitch gettin' head on the highway (Ridin')
My way deep throat on Luke's boat
When the moon rises, I'm cumin' in her eyes-es (Do it)
Just the way players play
Leave it up to me, I get fucked all day (Yeah)
Sucked all day, smokin' blunts, countin' cheese
Fucking bitches 'til they assholes bleed
What you say, ba-by

[Hook: Too $hort & Biggie]
All I want is hoes, big booty hoes

Uhh... uhh...

I'm feelin' kinda itchy for a quickie
Don't take off your coat, all you got to do is lick me
Me eat you, I beat you, then greet you to the door, bitch
'Cause I don't love you no more
Which one of these hoes in the lobby wanna slob me?
You know me, I like my dick, Brown like Bobby
In the duke shoot, then the bitch get the boot
Unless she lick ass and blow dicks like flutes
I like 'em cute, round tits and fat asses
Educated, so I can bust off on they glasses
I wanna cum on your tongue and gums, all night
The bitch drink nuts by the pint

[Pre-Hook: Too $hort]
Drink it, bitch!

(Don't take 'em to the crib unless they bonin')

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
It's after midnight, it's time to come up
Fuckin' with some sluts tryin' to bust a nut
I ain't seen this many hoes in a long time
I wanna make 'em all mine (Get down, ho)
But it's gettin' kinda late, and I can't wait
Bitch, fuck a first date
I pulled out my dick, she called me rude...
...but then she ate it like food (Tramp)
Then she noticed the limp and the whip
Recognize game, you've been pimped by a pimp
Throw all that trick shit, out the window
You come up short tryin' to doubt the pimp, ho
Too $hort baby, straight from Oakland
Ho money is my fix and I can't be broken
Freak bitches all on my dick
We on some Brooklyn - Oakland, California shit (Beotch!)

[Hook: Too $hort & Biggie]
All I want is hoes, big booty hoes
Check it out, here's another one
All I want is hoes, big booty hoes
(Don't take 'em to the crib unless they bonin')

[Outro: Too $hort]
You knew I was a dog when you met me, bitch (BITCH)
Ha ha, fo' sho' (YEAHH)
Tell you anything you wanna hear right about now
To the spot, that's where we goin' baby
See we goin' to the spot
Do our thang like we always do
You ain't know?

[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G. (Diddy)]
Motherfucka was amped (Uh huh)
The nigga was motherfuckin hyped up (Right?)
The nigga just grabbed the nigga, snuffed the nigga
And it was on from there
The motherfucker there wasn't nuttin stoppin him
(What what did the rest of his niggas do?)
Man the motherfuckers was just ready for anything
Them niggas was packin burners
Them niggas was ready to fight (Oh shit)
Whatever we had to do holmes (Uh huh)
Niggas was on the real flipmo' holmes (Uh huh)
It was just comin out like a motherfucker (Right)
The nigga amped be like come on
COME ON MOTHERFUCKER!!!

[Hook]
Come on, motherfuckers, come on

[Verse 1: Sadat X]
Let's go deep into the phrase, feel the sun rays
Off the forehead, everything is real
Biggie put me on this joint, so I'ma be the big wheel
Watch it spin, hey dad, placed your bet on seven
Peace to 106, 108, 110 and 111th
Hey Biggie, I understand you're from Brooklyn
With .22s in your shoes, yo, keep this joint cooking

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
Well, why not blow up the spot with Sadat?
Release the brainstorm to make your motherfucking brain warm
A strange form, something kind of lyrical
Biggie the bastard, Sadat's kind of spiritual
Well, in God we trust, guns I bust
Got that disgusting, sewer-style dumping
And, uh, do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that I bring?
Make an MC wanna sing for a living
Take the beatdown we fucking giving
C'mon, motherfucker!

[Hook]
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on

[Verse 3: Sadat X]
What? Niggas want drama, putting work on my block
When I told y'all last week that shit was too hot
Selling deuces and treys cuts my dimes
Somebody don't get paid, somebody's block get sprayed
Reaction is delayed as ya run down the block
Caught one in your chest, your breath come in spurts
Hey yo, Biggie, tell these niggas I'ma hit 'em where it hurts
The Big City, it don't spare no bodies
Call me papi chulo, to all the Spanish mamis
I'm about ten blunts down, drank three or four stouts
Seen five fat asses, passed this bitch with glasses
Hey, your money, that's your stock, yo bitch, pass the Glock
I'ma tell them, "It can happen, don't play me with that rap shit"
Life is real, so Biggie take the steel

[Hook]
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on

[Verse 4: Notorious B.I.G.]
I got seven Mac-11's, about eight .38's
Nine 9's, ten Mac-10's the shits never end
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
Huh, that's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the lamb spread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give MCs the runs dripping
When I throw my clip in the AK, I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flows remarkable, peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniff the yayo
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my God I'm dropping shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listening, smacking babies at they christening
So you better grab your pistol
'Cause if you sit still, I'm gonna make your fucking shit spill
And I'm talking 'bout buckets, why did I have to do it?
Sadat said fuck it, you got a gun, nigga bust it
'Cause I got mo' shots to pop ya
Big Poppa, breaking you off something proper
Signing off is the hardcore rap singer
AKA crack slinger, bring it any time nigga

[Hook]
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on

[Hook]
To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)

To all my Bronx (Niggas!)
To all my Queensbridge (Niggas!)
(Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!)

[Verse 1]
Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rips it quick
And kicks it quick; you know how black niggas get
With the hoods, fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, making crazy G's
Hitting buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue--take my loot, and I'm bagging you
Pimping hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make her wet in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga's style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga want to act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfucking back out
That's a real nigga for ya

[Hook]
To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (Niggas!)
To all my Bronx (Niggas!)
To all my Queensbridge (Niggas!)
(Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!)

[Verse 2]
When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case Dread want to riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
Not your ordinary: we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad, do a quarter, flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the DA, cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up north, bound first stop for the town
Of Fishkill, where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha-Hah! Yo G, pass the buddha

[Hook]
To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (Niggas!)

To all my Bronx (Niggas!)
To all my Queensbridge (Niggas!)
(Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!)

[Verse 3]
Money, hoes, and clothes
Blunt smoke coming out the nose, is all a nigga knows
Flipping on foes, putting tags on toes
Watching the stash grow, clocking the cashflow
The neighborhood gravedigger
Getting paid so much, all the bitches want to see a nigga
I guess they figure I'm paid, I want to get laid
Or since I got loot, I want to knock boots
I'd rather beat my dick than trick
And if she don't suck, then we don't fuck
I'd rather make a buck, drive a fat-ass truck
Grab the 9, two clips, and run amuck
Yes, flex after two or three Becks
As I wreck shit, what the fuck you expected?
A fly guy? Well fuck it, I'm the high guy
From Bed-Stuy, putting the swelling on your eye
And your nose even; when I choke ya, you stop breathing
And when Jake come, I'm leaving

[Hook]
To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (Niggas!)
To all my Bronx (Niggas!)
To all my Queensbridge (Niggas!)

[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Yo, check it, Call Lil' Cease

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
The doctor said I need about three weeks of recovery
But the nurses is lovin me
Sayin the best part of the day is my half
Feedin me breakfast, and givin me a sponge bath
(Notorious) Niggas say I died dead in the streets
Nigga I'm gettin high, gettin head on the beach
Chillin, sittin on about half a million
With all my niggas, all my guns, all my women
Next two years, I should see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealin
Got no love for the other side, fuck them tricks (fuck them)
Any repercussion, Junior M.A.F.I.A. spit clips (that's right)
All the time, Big Poppa kick the war rhymes
Raw flows, and that's how it goes

[Hook: Puff Daddy]
NOTORIOUS!

NO, NO, NO, NOTORIOUS!
He is.. he is..

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
This for my niggas slingin thangs, had my ring encaged
Truck, necklace, igloo ring and things
For the bitches, who see them rims spin and grin
That shit with the V-trim that win
And the enormous fields disperse of rap
On the road to the riches more furs to drag
More niggas to kill, than birds to bag
Hit the jeweler and splurge the tab, uh
Hops, out the truck like, "Trick, what up?"
Call me Sean if you suck, call me gone when I nut (come on)
That's the end of us, get your friend to fuck
Untwist and bend her up, you know the deal (No-no-notorious)
Niggas talkin real greasy on some ballin shit (that's right)
Funny how quick these pricks forget
Actin like I ain't the reason they traded they shit
Switched that 5, copped that 6 (that's right)
It's all good, you know who the clone is
Fuck the Joneses, niggas tryin to keep up with the Combses

Who that queen bitch, keep her glass filled to the rim?
The Notorious K-I to the M (Notorious)
That's me, on MTV, no doubt
Titty out like what - I don't give a fuck!
Y'all know my attitude, can't stand my cologne
Then stay your ass home, you and your chaperone
(Notorious) Things done changed, but we continue to reign
As the King and the Queen of hip-hop, me and B.I
Frank White still listen to all the (a)'ttention
I'm by his side, with the chrome fifth, playin my position (Notorious) Sexy, young thing, from the ghetto
That bitch rockin mics in high heel stilletos
We takin over like Francis
Switchin our styles like the hottest new dances
See, I let y'all live to stack a LITTLE paper
Be glad I pushed my album back, I did y'all hoes a favor!

[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Yeah
Bad Boy
Cash Money
2000, baby!

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Check the pain I inflict, like a convict, the Fulton digger
Jump in the Acura Vigor, after I stick ya
Rip ya like a razor, straight up Henny with no chaser
Watch me erase ya, misplace ya
Put you in the back with the derelicts
Yeah, I pop plenty shit
Chump, I'm making hits
No time for the crack rock and shit
Took it to another level
Now I'm getting crazy papes, getting paid from the devils
Another amateur trying to damage the pedigree
Of the B-I-G-G-I-E, you know it's me
Hoes, I thought you know I'm smooth as a baby's ass
Smooth as Teeddy Pendegrass, smoke the grass, get in your ass
The Brooklyn-born Teflon Don, wrecking shop
Getting props, proving nobody drops
Words as potent as the blunt smoking Bed-Stuy bandit
And niggas just can't understand it
I bust a cap for the brothers in Nap Nap, Comstock, and Clinton
You know my shit is hitting
Yeah, ya'll, a fly nigga, Biggie Smalls
Kicking flavor, make a nigga wanna dig up in their drawers
For the burner, catch a body
I got styles like karate
Jujitsu, when I hit you then I split you
Like a cantaloupe
Hope you got a rope to hang yourself
I rob for self; from Brooklyn, where else?
Fat like a Lexus coupe, I ripped your troop
Not even Lois Lane could get the scoop
What you think, I'm stupid?
My crew is mad deep
I hope you niggas sleep

[Verse 2: B.G.]
I throw a bomb through your window
Burn you up and your ho
I catch your mama going to therapy and cut her throat
Your little sister walking home from school
I abduct her, then I fuck her
I hit your park close up with the Louisville Slugger
B.G.-zy is the hustler, ignorant motherfucker
I was taught how to bust heads by the best head-busters
Cluckers, you know I got 'em, two for one, my nigga
I'm on V.L. if you want me, get some my nigga, come on

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Thugging is my thing; if I'm beefing, I'm banging
Slanging, it's in my nature, gotta be about my paper
Haters, I don't like 'em; bitches, I don't trust 'em
Niggas, I can't stand 'em, I creep down and pluck 'em
Strap stay in my hand, I gotta protect mine
Niggas trying to pull it off, "pop," goes the nine
That's how it got to be in these uptown streets
And a nigga like me, I play the game for keeps

[Verse 4: Juvenile]
I remember when niggas slang heroin up in balloons
I paid attention to everything, from killings to cartoons
Got a picture of Malcolm X on the wall in my room, bitch
Want some old nigga? Fuck with me, I'mma do 'em, shit
Nigga give me dope, I accept it, but don't respect him
Put my foot in their rectum right after I dome checked 'em
I be popping D, smoking weed, and full of that Hennesey
Fresh off the streets on my way to the penitentiary
Everybody whisper in ears when they gonna mention me
I been out doing it for years--since elementary
Real good relationship with guns and drugs
Because my whole neighborhood consists of crook and thugs
Everything is my own shit cause I don't fuck with scrubs
I don't need you harassing me when I'm up in the club
Trying to hustle a nigga, asking me for a dub
Quarter, ki's, and halfs is what I sling, cause that's what I love

[Verse 5: Turk]
I know you bitches know that I ain't to be played with
Dont have no picks and chooses who get they head split
They die quick, fucking with Turk, wodie get whacked
Spend a bin with Kevin and Randy leave ya flat on you back
And trust that, ain't bout to let no nigga steal me
Fuck that, I bust back with a .223
Big and full of that raw with no cut and be ready to creep
Innocent people move cause somebody fixing to get split

[Verse 6: Lil' Wayne]
Na, Na, it's iceberg shorty, Lordy have mercy
Come from under my shirts and flip'em and reverse'em
I'm coming so alert them
(Ur, Ur) fore I hurt them, desert eagle bursting
You haven't seen the worst and
I'm right near you and my gun blast quick, dog
Could kill you so run, dash, get gone
Wodies movin slow around this time they got bricks dog
I ain't got bricks dog, nigga break it off, what

[Outro: Puff Daddy]
Un huh, B.I.G. with the Cash Money Millionaires, forever
Juvenile, Lil' Wayne, Baby, Turk, B.G., Manny Fresh
Slim, CEO, and me P. Diddy, B.I.G, Born Again
And we won't stop, get money niggas

[Intro]
"Well it's the Funk Docta Spock.."
"Meth-Tical.."
"Biggie.. Biggie.." (mmmhmmmmmm)

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh.. uhh.. uhh.. (yo c'mon Big) uhh..
Fuck that, I preach it, my nine reaches
The prestigious, cats that speak this, Willie shit
Flooded pieces, my hand releases, snatches
Smack ya cabbage, half-ass rappers, shouldn't have it
So I grab it, never run, the outcome
Is usually, a beatdown brutally, fuck who you be
Or where you're from, West or East Coast, squeeze toast
Leave most in the blood they layin in, what, what?
The rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
It's more than I expected, I thought your jewels was rented
But they wasn't, so run it, cousin
I could chill, the heat doesn't
Ran up in your shell about a dozen, you never see bank like Frank White
Your hand clutchin, your chest-plate contemplate
You 'bout to die, nigga wait, keep yo' hands high

[Verse 2: Redman]
Yo.. yo yo
I don't brown nose out of town hoes
I'm up around fo' with the crowbar to the five point oh
I get bagged, I'm John Doe, suspect
You ass like prime roastin, Calvin Klein clothes
Explode the pyros when Doc guest appear
I'm out there, I bought it with George Jetson here
Your time is near, so get your body dropped off
I stopped trusting niggas since Gotti got caught
It's Bricks, keep your wrist covered, I'm piss colored
By the waist got a gun as dark as Kris brother
I.C.U., my sheisty crew, like ice me too
I break your legs, leave your eyes slightly blue
The Doc was born with a grenade palm
I'm concurrent in your hood like a, teenage mom
Yo Biggie (what? what?) She havin my bay-bayy
If I pull out the A.K., keep your hands high

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G & Method Man]
This rule is so underrated
Actin as if it can't happen, you're frontin'
Ain't no other kings in this rap thing
Biggie, a motherfuckin' rap phenomenon
This rule is so underrated
Actin as if it can't happen, you're frontin'
Ain't no other kings in this rap thing
Biggie, a motherfuckin' rap phenomenon

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh, uhh
I got a new mouth to feed, I'm due South with keys
Y'all pick seeds out y'all weed, I watch cowards bleed
Motherfucker please, it's my block with my rocks
Fuck that hip-hop, them one-two's, and you don't stops
Me and my nigga Lance, took Kim and Cease advance
Bought ten bricks, four pounds of weed plants
From Branson, now we lampin, twelve room mansion
Bitches get naked off "Get Money", "Player's Anthem"
Don't forget, "One More Chance" and my other hits, other shit
Niggas spit be counterfeit, robbery come naturally
In and out like fuckin rapidly, pass the gat to me
Make his chest rest, where his back should be, talkin' blasphemy
Blastin me, your family, rest in coffins often
Frank Wizzah, far from soft or fragilla
Play hard like Reggie Miller, rapper, slash dope dealer
Slash guerilla, slash illest turned iller

[Verse 4: Method Man]
Now now
Don't approach me with that rah rah shit, you out of pocket
I take these adolescents back to Spofford
Mentally, my energy, is like a figure eight, on it's side, that's infinity
Too many sick niggas, nickel nines bring the remedy
When you play the field, what's the penalty?
Unnecessary roughness, career endin' injuries for suckers
Stuck on stupid, shoot 'em with a dart like Cupid
Until they got love for my music
Star Wars, I'm Han Solo, with three egos
And three charges, I got to "See-three-P.O.'s"
This is whoop-yo'-ass-day, the sequel
High bar flow-er with no equal
Niggas swingin' swords in the WAR, that's my people
Sho' nuff, before I roll up, this is a hold up
Hands high, reach for the sky
I rep S.I., the unpretty, word to Left Eye
New York Shitty, put they weight on it
And who better for the job than Biggie?
The Notorious, Jeee-zus, "Unbelievable" rhyme that reaches
And touch individual, small frame buck and change
MC, What's-Your-Name, tuck your chain
All about the fortune, fuck the fame, labels still extortin'
Kick me when I'm down, but I'm up again, scorchin'
Hot — forcin' my way up in the door
To kill the bullshit like a matador
Keep your hands high (what?)

[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Wooo! There's gonna be a lot of punchin' in this motherfucker!
Y'all better be swift with that punch button, Jack!
Biggie! - Biggie!

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
And wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D wasn't B-I-G
I had to get P-A-I-D that's why my mom's hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smoking mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court
For an assault that I caught in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand cause man

[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
Come and run with me - I really wanna show you
How I run the streets - I really wanna show you
How I'm clockin' G's - I really wanna show you
Come and run with me - I really wanna show you

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two TECs
And when he start to bust, he like to ask: "Who's next?"
I got my honey on the Amtrak
With the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be Lieutenant
Bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin' black
Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up; see what's up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated like Nino at the Carter
Heard Tec got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks, I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy - She'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me! Blowing like a bubble;
In the everyday struggle

[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
Come and run with me - I really wanna show you
How I run the streets - I really wanna show you
How I'm clockin' G's - I really wanna show you
Come and run with me - I really wanna show you

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Giuliani
Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti

[Verse 4: Nas]
Guns and diamonds
Bitches put they tongues where the sun ain't shinin'
Take keys 'til they spot us, snakes flee with consignment
This kid he got his crib raided, police found grams
They locked up, his whole fam; moms, sister, his old man
Nigga bailed his moms out, then he told on his man
Now they home, actin like nuttin wrong, hustlin again
He tried to be the next Frank White, and Escobar
Pickin up coke a fiend holds it in a separate car
Cooks it up til it's bright white, cut it tight right
Then he slings it to the fiends, lookin like Fright Night
Coppin the motorbikes, the scooters, countin dough on computers
High technology dealers, to the users and losers
Half-leg DiDi, try to swap drug for TV's
Stores run out of baking soda from BK to QB
My niggas die for the cause, .45 on the drawer
City laws made by Big Nas and Biggie Smalls
Bitches, holdin my weight in they titties and bras
My bitches out of state get busy while they pushin my cars
Callin me up, callin me baller, call for they cut
Pretty hoes bring me my cash, swallow all of this nut
Seats on the Bent' stay nasty, push the dash
For the stash box is where the cash be; watchin for task force
Cause I know they comin but I'm reachin my goal
Fuck bummin, I'm makin sure I leave this whole game wit somethin
Crib in West Palms for my dime, crib for my moms
Ridiculous, you lookin at the next Nicholas Barnes, baby

[Chorus (repeat to fade)]

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G]
Another day in the ghetto
One look outside I'm already upset yo
It look about a hundred-and-two
It's a Saturday and Biggie ain't got nothing to do
Uhh, I'm interrupted by a phone ring {*brrrrring*}
Sometimes I wish I never got the motherfucking thing
"Hello hello? Can I speak to Biggie?"
Yo, who dis? "Taisha" Yo call back, I'm busy
Why don't ya hit me on the box a little later
Washed up, got dressed, hits the elevator
Steps out it's the same old scene
Dope fiend, crack fiend, eyewitness news team
I seen a honey with a butt looking butter soft
I know she looks much better with them clothes up off
Sitting all thick, with the ruby red lipstick {*SMACK*}
That's the one I gotta get with

[Hook 1: Notorious BIG]
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha

"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G]
She said "If I get with you
I gotta get witcha whole hood rat crew, whatcha I think I do?
Sling skins for a living,my name ain't November
This ain't Thanksgiving, you ain't Michael Bivins
Mack it up, flip it, rub it down
Do me baby, I ain't down
My name ain't 2Pac I don't "Get Around"
You hitting this nigga, how that sound?"
Huh, first of all you got me mixed up with
Somebody ya done slept with, hold up
That's my Neneh Cherry shit, I got something slicker
Let me just sip up on this liquor
All I wanna do is smoke a little chronic
Slam ya like Onyx, and get ya hooked on
This Biggie Smalls phonics, 102
How to squeeze 22's in them Reebok shoes, HUH?

[Hook 2: Notorious BIG, Lil' Cease]
Can I get witcha (can I get witcha)

"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G]
I said walk me upstairs, cause I forgot my Phillies
She said "I don't care, so don't be acting silly"
I knew I had her trapped with my hardcore raps
And it wouldn't take a second before I had her on her back
Pulling back the bra straps, threw on my Silk CD
Cause, "I wanna get freaky with you"
Lose control on the skins is all I can picture, now I'm about to hit you

[Hook 3: Notorious BIG, Lil' Cease]
Can I get witcha (can I get witcha)
Can I get witcha (can I get witcha)
"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

[Verse 4: Lil' Cease]
To all my hoes, respect due
Tamika sorry I left you
Michelle I'm glad I met you
You make the head feel special
Now I know it's official
That I can touch and tease you
Pull up my pants and diss you
And hit the door you came through
It's Cease-a-Lee, a.k.a. Mista Nasty
Germany style, these hoes they blast me
One of the chickenhead with sex appeal pass me
That's her hands, ankles, feet they ashy
I like the flashy type, who pass with dykes
With long hair, and they ass be right
I get up on that ass, see what that be like
I fuck a bitch good, if she ask me right, huh

[Hook 1: Notorious BIG]
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T, see
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
"Why you wanna get with me?"
Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

[Intro: Notorious B.I.G. (Puff Daddy)]
(Yo, check this out, yeah motherfuckers)
(Come on motherfuckers, B.I.G. motherfuckers)
Too much smoke in here man
Open a fucking window
What the fuck man
Yo yo yo yo yo

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
I make your mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
When I release, you lose teeth like Lil' Cease
Nigga please, blood floods your Dungarees
And that's just the half of my warpath
Laugh now, cry later, I rhyme greater
Than the average player hater and spectators
Buy my CD twice, they see me in the streets
They be like, "Yo he nice, but that's on the low though"
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out fo'-fo's and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggas, snort-'caine niggas
Extortion came quicker, bought the Range, nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be
'Til Lil' Cease crippled me
Now I play hard, like my girl's nipples be
The game sour like a pickle be, y'all know the rules
Move from BK to New Jeruz; thinking 'bout
All the planes we flew, bitches we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back--take two
Motherfuckers mad 'cause I blew, niggas envious
Too many niggas on my dick, shit strenuous
When my men bust, you just move with such stamina
Slugs missed ya; I ain't mad at 'cha
Blood rushin', concussions ain't nothin'
Catch cases, come out fronting, smoking something
Sippin' White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin'
I laced it with the basic, six TV's a system
Knocking Mase shit; face it, we hard to hit
Guard your shit, 'fore I stick you for your re-up
Wipe the pee up, lick shots, woke your seed up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up, long kiss

[Hook: Joe Hooker]
Y'all can't see this
That this might be the night
This might be the night, that's right, that's right
This might be the night (Kiss your ass goodbye)

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Niggas playing they hands wrong, that's why they won't last long
Finessed what I was dealt with from the day I was born
While you bent up on that corner, niggas plotting and scheming
Up in them little holes, be creeping with Mac demons
Niggas know not to fuck with my dough
Niggas know not to fuck with this little bro, I'm 10 seconds hit'n'go
Black mask, black truck, chrome rims, Chuk' Timbs
Enough to confuse any witness
Strongest of calibers, is what we only travel with
You gotta get hit, your man dead, so you got a hand in it
Extort y'all, once friends, now we gotta cross y'all
You know the niggas with the biggest balls set the new laws
And flip fours, have 'em washing drawers while you up North
Gat to your jugular, getting your salad tossed
Overhearing niggas situations, singing like Lou Rawls
Sitting on the stand with no remorse

[Hook: Joe Hooker]
Y'all can't see this
That this might be the night
This might be the night, that's right, that's right
This might be the night (Kiss your ass goodbye)

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Yo, yo, how we do niggas, I don't beef, I shoot niggas
If I can't get the main character, a few niggas then
I don't need no gin to boost me
I got enough steam to blow, somebody gotta go
I got fire in my heart, guns in my car
Cash in my Carhartts, it ain't hard to get 'em
Like blaow when I hit 'em, the nigga shit his drawers
When the 40-pound hit him, the fuck these niggas thought?
Could it be the fame, maybe it's the 2 Benz or
Would it be the same if I couldn't claim those?
Fuckin' put holes through your Range Rove'
Cocksucker, beat it, while you bleedin' on the dashboard
Niggas get, what they hand call for, I'm gettin' rich
You get deaded, I get erections over revenge, kid
You get a quiet spot in the shade for a grave
I'll lay a nigga down and steam roll away...

[Hook 2X: Joe Hooker]
Y'all can't see this
That this might be the night
This might be the night, that's right, that's right
This might be the night (Kiss your ass goodbye)

[Outro: Puff Daddy]
But I would've loved to hear
A Big Pun and B.I.G. collabo
That shit would've been incredible

[Big Pun talking]
Aye you know what I'm sayin', it was just happen
We have our day, you know?
I seen him, I seen him, I seen him at the pearly gates, yaknahmean?
We keep it, keep it, keep it goin' from there

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh, I drink filthy
My moms and pops mixed me with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey
Huh, what a set up
Shoulda pushed 'em dead off, wipe the sweat off
Uhh, 'cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off
Benz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-land
Army fatigue break up teams, the enemies
Look man, you wanna see me locked up, shot up
Moms crotched up over the casket, screamin' "BASTARD!"
Cryin', know my friends is lyin'
Y'all know who killed 'em filled 'em with the lugars from they Rugers
Or they Desert, dyin' ain't the shit but it's pleasant
Kinda quiet, watch my niggas bring the riot
Giving cats the opposite of diets
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me
Shit, I need the company (uh-huh)
Apologies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me, sorta like
Daddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest
Silencers so you can't hear it
Competition still fear it, shit don't ask me
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still

[Chorus: Freeway]
Nigga still gotta get his grind on
Come get introduced to my home
I grew up in the crime zone
Soon as you grown, you on your own, you keep your strap
You keep your chrome 'cause the streets is chilly
Now get your grind on
Come get introduced to my home
A nigga grew up in the pro-jects, end up gettin' mo' stressed
Mo' money, mo' drama you know a nigga keep his armor
'Cause the streets are killin'
Now get your grind on
Come get introduced to my home

[Verse 2: Big Punisher]
Yo, yo
The penalty is death, especially when I'm mentally stressed
My enemies hang with me 'til I eventually flip
I never reject an offer to battle
Slap a coffin on the saddle
And rattle like a wooden horse to el barrio
Niggas talk but they babble 'cause they ain't sayin' nuttin'
If ain't blazin somethin' with the MAC, I'm in the shack bakin' muffins
Fake the funk and get your rump roast
One dose of the toast'll make you jump if you come close
Pun spoke, ain't no more debatin'; my Squad been waitin'
For the perfect time to give you what you all been waitin'
An orgi-nation of veterans built
With genuine skills to pay the heat, gas, and the rest of the bills
Invest in the real, don't get left in the hills
My TEC and my steel turn your whole crew into vega-ta-bles
We blessed with the will to never surrender
'Cause my every agenda's in and out
Unseen like I entered the ninja, it's my world

[Chorus: Freeway]
Nigga still gotta get his grind on
Come get introduced to my home
I grew up in the crime zone
Soon as you grown, you on your own, you keep your strap
You keep your chrome 'cause the streets is chilly
Now get your grind on
Come get introduced to my home
A nigga grew up in the pro-jects, end up gettin' mo' stressed
Mo' money, mo' drama you know a nigga keep his armor
'Cause the streets are killin'
Now get your grind on

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
I got that new F-N, call it that faggot nigga gun
Couple of hollow tips make you faggot niggas run
Crack pull up, everybody clear out
Anybody pumpin' that rock is gettin' aired out
I'm in that caddy with my bitch in the pack
Your mommy got a body but she itchin' to clap
And I know you pitchin' purple but we switchin' the packs
Listen, don't make me hurt you I'm just givin' the facts
On that I 9-5 swervin' to a town near you
My niggas watch out for that Black Suburbans
And no it's not the Feds, man papi's home
And papi got it good, he could put you on
Listen, I done made abandoned blocks look hot
Nine to ten Benzes, a couple of drops
Couple of rubber bands from the corrupt cops
Just to see my niggas eat and shit and huggin' the blocks
Crack a chastise 'em, right besides 'em
In front of a hundred million viewers, shouldn't surprise 'em
We from the Bronx where the may-ors lift up
And niggas get shot in broad day 'cause we don't give a...
Fuck, little niggas on bike and just shoot you
All for a pair of some Nikes, the shit's brutal
I done seen fiends O.D., shot the wrong pack
Then they call the shit the bomb smack
Word to Crack, the God body, the hard body, the realest ever
The John Gotti, this rap shit, will it kill me? Never

[Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G.]
This goes out to cats (stupid), fingers in they ass again
Fifty dollar half-a-men, daydreamin'
Fuck around get wet like semen, your whole team-and
Be Mor-gan than Freeman
I took the cream and, moved to new places new faces
Fuck the screwfaces, 'cause when I flip
I make the papers, dangerous, we Goodfellas
Niggas can't bang with us, try to do me
My crew be unruly (what)
Some old school cats that call gats toolies
Call blacks moolies, think it's cool to smoke woolies
And fuck without rubbers (what), specialize
In killin' wives and grandmothers, who ya trustin', shit
When Frank start bustin', Frank start somethin'
Killin' ya gently, God meant me, to push a Bentley
Me and Sean Combs takin' broads home
On the phone with the chip, with these Cristal chicks
'Bout to make our own porno flicks, my life's the shit...

[Intro - T.I.]
Hey what it is pimpin
Slim Thug and T.I.P. doing it B.I.G with B.I.G (yea a ye yeaah..)
Ya understand what I'm saying (hey..)
P.S.C. pimpin!
Y'all already know what it is man, its a bad boy thing man
Grand hustle collaboration, Y'all already know man
Boss Hog whats happening (hey..)
A-Town pimpin!

[Verse 1 - Slim Thug]
Slim Thugga!
I roll strapped Glock 40 in my lap
I rap but still think like I'm grinding in the trap
Trying to adapt to the change from the streets to the game
Can't be selling CD's and still selling dem thangs
Cause snitches drop names and bring alot of problems
And putting somthing in they head the only way you gonna solve em'
Jackas stay plotting watching your every move
And the minute you snooze will be the minute you lose, dude
Thats the rules so I cruise with the tools
To fix the damn fools that think I'm slipping with my jewels
Breakin old habits so hard to do
Thats why you see me on the same block with the same crew
And everybody sitting fat living good
And I'm the only nigga that be rapping in my hood
I was raised by the hustlas, and ganged by the G's
And taught by the bosses how to stack that cheese

[Hook - T.I.]
You got rich and G shit is still a part of you
Cause breakin old habits so hard to do
You still watch for the haters and the robbing crew
Cause breakin old habits so hard to do
When on shot that nigga like I started to
Cause breakin old habits so hard to do
Fresh out the dealership crackin open cigars in the coupe
Man cause breakin old habits so hard to do

[Verse 2 - The Notorious B.I.G.]
Damn it feel good to see people up on it
Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it
My brain is haunted, with mean dreams
GS's with BB's on it, supreme schemes, to get Richer
Than Richie, quickly, niggas wanna hit me
If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it
My lyrical carjack, make your brains splat
High caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit
In my circumfrence, mad bitches, with mad lucci
Bulletproof vestes under they coochie
Spittin my uzi, don't lose me, my trigga niggas represent
Drivin dirty in J-30's gettin bent
And to my hit hoes, my murder mommies
I be smokin trees in Belize when they find me
While you still killin niggas with punany, like Connie
And Cyrus up in Cypress fuck you raw, you on the floor with the virus
While I just, slang coke, smoke pounds to choke
Got lawyers watchin lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it
Them country niggas call me Frank White
I'm squirtin off in my loft of course I know my shit's tight
Sunrise open my eyes no surprise
Got my shorty flying in with keys taped to her thighs
With all the utensils, who hang my china thing
She half black half oriental eighty-six she got me rentals

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - T.I.]
I used to drive a Chevy Monte Carlo, bricks of blow all in it
I was taught to sell the shit, you put your nose all in it
Let my bitch drive the Benz but the Rolls off limits
How you call yourself pimpin, with hoes all in your buisness
What it is, the music business or the streets make a decision
I do this in my sleep, and you way out your division pimp
This game we play for keeps, and the rules remain hidden
This ain't a place for lames and that snitching shit is forbidden
After sitting in the kitchen and whipping with hopes of getting back
All that off a brick to go blow it, so it even 50 stacks
And now I'm sitting back, thinking about a time
When a nigga get a 100 g's, think he went down
But now look for loyalty in the game, it ain't there
And things ain't the same they changed it ain't fair
Real niggas dead, doing their time and ain't here
You commit the same crime and come home the same year

[Hook]

[Intro: Diddy]
Its Bad Boy bitch
Scram Jones... the Clipse... B.I.G
Let's go

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Niggas in my faction don't like asking questions
Strictly gun testing, coke measuring
Giving pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hitting fanny, spendin chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
Muah!, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four, and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Leer
Yes my dear shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin, no lying
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big dangerous you're just a Likkle Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success, escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all, death controls y'all
Big don't fold y'all, (big don't fold y'all)
I spit phrases that'll thrill you, (thrill you)
You're nobody till somebody kills you (I don't wanna die)

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Do you know where you're going to?
Just a memory, everybody dying
When I throw my clip in the AK, may you rest in peace
Your nobody 'til somebody kills you
Do you know where you're going to?
Just a memory, everybody dying
When I throw my clip in the AK, may you rest in peace
Your nobody 'til somebody kills you

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Label limbo, I treat it like the wind blows
My back don't bend, see papi is my kenfolk
Spin out the work, as if it's on a ten spoke
Soul benefactor the benz, he made the rims poke
Trust me they can't touch P, in one touchie
Turn drop-head coupe to dune-buggy
Admire the verses, their inspired by the hearses
That carried my niggas, and had the church mothers cursing
Imagine the glamour that comes out the flow
Of a nigga who still play in the snow like Santa
The wrist is rushing, my ears is blushing
And the diamonds in my chain, big as grandma's buttons, (yes!)
On the flipside, the steel I'm gripping
You thought all the floss had me slipping?
Think again, blink again let me know that your bluffing
Lead give permanent concussion, you're nothing

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Do you know where you're going to?
Just a memory, everybody dying
When I throw my clip in the AK, may you rest in peace
Your nobody 'til somebody kills you
Do you know where you're going to?
Just a memory, everybody dying
When I throw my clip in the AK, may you rest in peace
Your nobody 'til somebody kills you

[Verse 3: Malice]
Ha ha ha ha ha check out the facade
On the face of rap, so we gon raise the bar
A mil on the crib, mean a quarter on the car
Bentley coupe another short of the arnage
Even as a youth I was loitering the stoop
Underneath the nose, and the Feds had no clue
I was pushing keys in a V with no roof
Rich, black, two big guns and no coof
Things at the label, well they tend to get unstable
And that pretty much leave Malice at the table
Or over the stove with the flame to the ladle
Because I'm a provider as long as I am able
This here hughe the most foolish of blues
When I tell my mom the price
She damn near sent me to my room
It's the M-A-L-I-C-I-O-U-S
You don't wanna try nigga, you next uhh

[Hook]

[Outro: Diddy]
Biggie Duets...
Born Again...
Life After Death...
Legacy lives on..and on, and on
These motherfuckers still can't see you BIG
Shit you ain't even here..
Motherfuckers better step their game up..
Greatest of all time, Greatest of all time!
Motherfuckers...

[Intro: Notorious B.I.G. (Faith Evans)]
1970 somethin', 1970 somethin'
1970 somethin', 1970 somethin' (Oooooh)
1970 somethin', 1970 somethin' (Ooh ooh oooooh)
1970 somthin'

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G. (Faith Evans)]
1970 somethin'
Nigga I don't sweat the date, my moms is late
So I had to plan my escape, out the skins
In this world, the fly girl (Yeah)
Tanqueray or Hennessy until I called Earl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck (Hey yeah)
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
While, Juvenile rippin' mics and shit (Ooh)
New York, New York ready for the likes of this
Uh, then came the worst date, May, 21st
2:19 is when my mama water burst
No spouse in the house, so she rolled herself
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical chord's wrapped around my neck (Ooh)
I'm seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy (Ooooh ooh ooh)
The doctor looked and said "He's gonna be a Bad Boy."

[Hook: Faith Evans (BIG)]
I remember back in time
(1970 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines
I knew that I was goin' somewhere
(19, 70 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Let me take you back in time
Before I even got the rhyme, before I had nickels and dimes
I knew that I was goin' somewhere yeah

[Verse 2: The Game (Faith Evans)]
Would 'Pac be alive, if you let 'Pac drive?
Swear to God, to reverse it, I'll give my Left Eye
With the right I'll visualize the king of Bed-Stuy (Ooh)
Checkin' his daughter, Tyanna into junior high (Yeah)
If I was in Brooklyn and B.I. was still alive
In 2006, it might sound like this
NY, 7-1-8's, 2-1-2's
With Sue's rendezvous, it's like Moulin Rouge (Ohh ohh)
High fashion, uptown Air Force Ones and Vasquez
Puerto Ricans with fat asses (Ooh ooh)
Blazed dutch masters, we dump ashes
On models in S classes for you bastards (Ohh ohh)
Catch a cab to Manhattan, with that Broadway actin'
You hype, that Belly shit'll get you capped and wrapped in plastic
Tell the captain to ask Rog' What's Happenin'?
I hear, nor speak no evil inside the magnum (Ooooh ooh ooh)

[Hook: Faith Evans (BIG)]
(1970 somethin', 1970 somethin')
I remember back in time
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines
I knew that I was goin' somewhere
(19, 70 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Let me take you back in time

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G. (Faith Evans)]
Now I'm thirteen, smokin' blunts makin' cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team (Yeah-ah)
Riskin' ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearin' the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream (Ooh oh)
I mean, I wanna blow up, stack my dough up
So school, I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up (Ohh)
Mom said that I should grow up, and check myself (No-oo)
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself (Oooh)
Put the drugs on the shelf, nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, king of New York, I wanna be it (Oh yeah)
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary
C-74, Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind a great steel gate (Oh no)
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked, was all the money for bail

[Hook: Faith Evans (BIG)]
I remember back in time
(1970 somethin')
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines
I knew that I was goin' somewhere
(1970 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Let me take you back in time
Before I even got the rhyme, before I had nickels and dimes
I knew that I was goin' somewhere yeah
(1970 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Said I knew I

And I knew that I was going somewhere yeah

Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed no angel dust, label us Notorious
Thug ass niggas that love to bust, it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scrambling, gambling
Up in restaurants with mandolins, and violins
We just sitting here trying to win, trying not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke need oxygen, steadily counting them Benjamins
Nigga you should too, if you knew, what this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since '92
Look at all the bullshit I been through
Sure caught beef with you know who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Nigga, blue light, nigga, move like Mike, shit
Not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick, cause
Me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit yo' game, talk yo' shit

Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas I got ta fight one

[Verse 2: Twista and Swizz Beatz]
(Ladies and gentlemen, Twista)
Making money, living marvelous
In God we trust
Don't too many niggas wanna start with us
Got big guns in the cars with us
Bust at any motherfucker acting hard with us
They really wanna show you what a G.I.B
I'd rather be sipping Remy in V.I.P
We can hear the music and that'll be by me
Twista with the legendary nigga B.I.G (Uuuuu)
Brooklyn to K-Town, when you checking out the flow
You know it's gon' reign with persistence
Two legends on the same track, two different planes of existence
Let's get it cracking, I love to bust flows
Hit it from the back cause I love to fuck ho
Do it for the city, I love Chicago
Calico's bumping, I love to bust dough (Jeeesus)
You think you could spit on the mic like you Biggie and flow just as steady as I
Shit, it's real, you know you love em, you ain't got Ready To Die
Life After Death, give it to you however you want it nigga
Got it, they got ya, give it to you, however you want it nigga, Huuuu
Cause the shit it get deep
So I carry big heat
Screaming "come and get me"
Twista and Biggie on the Swizz Beat (Swizzie)
Free mils, I love to make one
All these cars, I love to ride one
All these hoes, I love to cut one
A tribute to Big, I love to bust one

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone and (Swizz Beatz)]
(Them Bone boys is back! Them Bone boys is back! Let's go)
In the middle of it I'mma
Bring niggas more drama then they baby mamas
Nigga wanna battle I'mma bomb ya
One man, but attack like a pack of piranhas
Like terracotta, niggas always ready for the war
But they really don't wanna see a nigga though
We can get em in a minute then we finish with the venom of the rhythm of a nigga with a sick-o-flow
Doing it with Swizz, oh no!
You niggas is in some trouble
Somebody better call po-po, it's gonna be murder when I get to serving them verbally (Yeah!)
Nigga y'all heard of me
Wig splitter, killer nigga, word to me
And I'm classic like Bird and Magic with a tactic to snatch his rep back and stack some platinum
Dumping on them at random
With the bullets I brand them
Fitting to hold the game ransom, running up in your mansion, cash demanding, flashing cannons (Let's go)
Niggas ain't ready for this one cause (C'mon) I'm on a mission to get even better believe it
I'm heavily heated, it's easy to see me
If you want to see me, let that be the reason (C'mon, B.I.G.!)

[Hook]

(Notorious! Notorious!)
You just heard the sounds of the King of New York
B.I.G. (B.I.G.)
There's only one crown

[Notorious B.I.G] + (Faith Evans)
To my motherfuckin' man, fifty grand, the alcholic man
Inject a tall can in his blood stream if he can
Biggie Smalls, the pussy stroker
Emcee provoker, the chocolate tah smoker (huh?)
I like to mack in Maximas and Acuras
Your girl butt cheeks, I'm smackin' (huh?)
The raw rapper, spot smacker
Wit the lil hooker on my lap-ah, you know your favorite macker
A shy nigga, but I ain't ya fuckin' comforter
And If I ever fall in love, I bet I'm fuckin' her
Ask the hooker, If I didn't jug her
She try to front, then I put the Chuckii Booker on her
(Why you wanna...play games on me?)
Bitch, you crazy? Commitments, I'm Swayze
No time for the ill shit
Mess with the niggas on that real blood spill shit
My rappin' tactics, are drastic
Stretchin' motherfuckers like Mr. Fantastic
So if you wanna see my Pedigree, you better be
Filled with energy, niggas never gettin' me

[Hook 2X: Bobby Valentino and Cheri Dennis] + (Ludacris ab-libbing)
Big cities and bright lights
Short days and long nights
No stress and no strife
I'm high off living the life

[Ludacris]
It's clear to see that I'm the motherfuckin' man, I done learned from the
Best of em; Took the first slot, niggas still second guessin' em
Hoes, I'm undressin' em', foes, I'm not stresin' em'
Outlastin' a bunch of 'em , outflowed the rest of em'
Cuz everyday, I stay preachin' on the pulpit
So tell them haters they could miss me with that bullshit
But I won't miss, I'm Luda, the heat holder
I'm rich, bitch! I've done more shows than Oprah
And I'm a soldier, ready for whatever
Roll with a bunch of niggas that don't know no better
King like Coretta, countin' mo' cheddar
Just hired two dykes to be my ho getters
When it comes to these women, dog, ain't no one fuckin' wit me
They runnin' back, you think I had TJ Duckett wit me
That's cause I throw it like Vick, from the yard line
Menage a trois, it's safe to say I'm havin' hard times

[Hook] + (Ludacris ab-libbing)

[Snoop Dogg]
To my nigga Chopper dot, with the whoopty-whop on the block
Got the heaters cocked, cause I know the suckers on the block
Hennesey and Belve-D, brings a lot of jealousy
Nigga stop snitchin', nephew, why you tellin' me?
They say the game ain't what it use to be on (?)
Used to be a G, but now he just a ho
Runnin' 'round poitin' fingers, tellin' names
You fuckin' up the rules to this dirty game, and it's a diry shame
I ain't flippin' out, that's probably why I'm dippin' out
Ya'll fools trippin' out, that why I'm on a different route
Now, makin' money, havin' clout, what's what it's all about
Twenty seven cars and a tweleve bedroom house
Now they call me Snoopy Trump
I keep my heater close, cause I love to bust
Now hat's a stain on a nigga, I bang on a nigga
Kick rocks and watch how I do my thang, young nigga; I'm livin' the life!

[Hook] + (Snoop Dogg ab-libbing)

[Intro: R. Kelly]
New York to Chi
Perfect combination
Kells, Biggie

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
You see, I don't sweat these hoes
I keep 'em in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds
Bitches just like to play the merry-go

[Yeah we know, drop the scenario]
It was me, Dee, the MPV
The blunts and brew thang, knockin' some Wu-Tang
M-E-T-H-Oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip, and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the Gee's obsolete
Don't sleep! Banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rappin' to?
That's my nigga Dee, damn he got Gee
Now she fuckin him and fuckin me, see

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Mi casa, you casa (Oh)
I ain't lookin for no wife
I just wanna give dick to ya (Oh)
Hit the club, drink, dance all night wit cha
Do the pussy good, I might do anything for ya
Girl show me how to work that thing (Wo-oh)
You make a motherfucking thug wanna sing (Oh Oh)
Baby baby, can't you see? (Whoa)
We gon' fuck until six in the mornin (Whoa)

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
Now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard cause I'm a rap star
I be cruisin up the block, I be passin her
Pimpin hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, schemin on a gang-bang
She should've used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's sayin I dissed her cause I'm fuckin her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets 'em pissed, uh
But she started that fuckin family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me?
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit yo' nasty ass

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson]
Red bows, stilettos do please
Hit fellas to show off yo' booty
I'm hangin wit the best of them, sweet
If you wanna, I'm a veteran
When I show up to the club, it's V-I-P (Oh)
When they dressin in the club if it's B.I.G. (Ooh wee)
I'm not lookin to find a wife (Find a wife)
Just someone to make a friend of mine

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Mi casa, you casa (Oh)
I ain't lookin for no wife
I just wanna give dick to ya (Oh)
Hit the club, drink, dance all night wit cha
Do the pussy good, I might do anything for ya
Girl show me how to work that thing (Wo-oh)
You make a motherfucking thug wanna sing (Oh Oh)
Baby baby, can't you see? (Whoa)
We gon' fuck until six in the mornin (Whoa)

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
I roll up, the black Impala
I'm so high when I walk in the club
I see this chick that used to get the dick
Now she freakin on the floor, make a nigga reminisce
Ah, wanna back in my ride again
But I don't want no girlfriend
See I just wanna hit it and we can be cool
We can do this if you feelin the same way too
Come on girl, lets go to my hotel
After party all night in my hotel
Pop mo', smoke 'dro in my hotel
In twenty minutes, girl hit me on my cell

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Mi casa, you casa (Oh)
I ain't lookin for no wife
I just wanna give dick to ya (Oh)
Hit the club, drink, dance all night wit cha
Do the pussy good, I might do anything for ya

You make a motherfucking thug wanna sing (Oh Oh)

[Notorious B.I.G.]
What you expected from his next of kin
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, Glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin
The lesson from the Smith and Wesson is depressin
Niggas keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question
How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
And my body start to shake, if I should die before I wake

[Korn] + (Notorious B.I.G.)
I'm here, I'm watching you (if I should die before I wake)
Love, the flesh, my blood's pourin through (if I should die before I wake)
This, can be, reality (if I should die before I wake)
Wake, up, my dead face I see (if I should die before I wake)
My dead face I see, my dead face I SEE!!

{*Korn electric guitar w/ indistinct shouting*}

[Notorious B.I.G.]
On your mark, get set, when I spark you're wet
Look how dark it get when you're marked wit death
Should I, start your breath or should I let you die
If he start to cry, ask why?
Lyrically, I'm worshipped, don't front, the word's sick
You cursed it, but rehearsed it
I drop unexpectedly like bird shit
You herbs get, stomped quickly for raw T's and show money
Don't forget the publishin, I'm punishin
I'm done wit them, son I'm surprised you run wit them
I think they got cumin, cause they nothin but bitch
Tryna blow up like nitro wit dynamite sticks
Mad I smoke, but yo I rock diamonds that's sick
Got paper off my flow, ride wit my own click
Take chicks to Cairo, layin wit yo' bitch
I know you playin you was rich
Fuck you prick, when I see you I'ma..

[Korn] + (Notorious B.I.G.)
I am here, I'm watching you (when I see you I'ma..)
Love, the flesh, my blood's pourin through (when I see you I'ma..)
This, can be, reality (when I see you I'ma..)
Wake, up, my dead face I see (when I see you I'ma..)
My dead face I see (when I see you I'ma..), my dead face I SEE!!

Damn Ma, I love you like the lah, the ganja
Sensimilla, can I feel ya
All I wanna do is touch ya
The ultimate rush, you're drugs baby

[Missy]
Don't you know I'm the ultimate? To get this nookie, be fortunate
Just like tastin pussy with pork in it
People stop when I'm walkin in, I'm twist-in twistin 'em
Back on ten, I'm talkin 'bout like when Mase come back again
My ski's is immaculate, my paper stackin keep trackin
I'm mackin yo slackin, reaction makes ya'll dicks grin
I'm mo' better than gold diggers with figures
Mo' bigger than Jigga's and even Paris Hilton's
Damn sir, sniff me like the coke, three lines
Me won't give you none
Sent amilia, all you wanna do is sniff me
The ultimate rush, get high baby
Damn sir, sniff me like the coke, three lines
Me won't give you none
Sent amilia, all you wanna do is sniff me
The ultimate rush, the drugs baby

[Hook 2x] (w/ Biggie ad-libs)

[Verse Two: B.I.G. & Missy Elliott
Now Biggie Smalls is not the type to fall in love with 'em
Hit 'em and forget 'em and go handle my business
I like the kind of whine and dine, who grindin' all the time
Yo ex girl was a fly, but now lucked up on a dime, nigga
What is it with you, all you wanna do is lay around
And stay around and get mad when I play around
I like to lay never work, put your money in my purse
To the mall, I go search matchin' shoes for my skirt
Tuesday I saw you on the zee, but you still wanna get wit me
Wednesday is the Benz day, that's what your friends say
Me and my friends got your Benz, attractin' mens
And spendin' dividends, blowin' like the wind

[Hook 2x] (w/ Biggie ad-libs)

[Verse Three: B.I.G. & Missy Elliott]
So I guess you think I'm slippin' cause I ain't flippin'
Baby, I'm Big Poppa, ain't no need to be trippin'
I ain't trippin' nor flippin', I'm just liquor sippin'
At the bar, tippin' wit your money, can you pay the difference?
It seems like it's a waste of time, that's why I wrote the rhyme
I hear you jump in every car, except for mines
Nigga, I don't jump in cars, I'm a superstar
Face way to flaw, you should hang me on your wall
All I do all day is drink Tanqueray
Thinking of a way to put a smile on your face
Make me smile, see them teeth, me look cute down to them features
My waste, my physique, me don't want freak-a-leek
Should I wine and dine? You put ring on your fingers
While sex from the next man in the bedroom lingers
Sex will never linger, hold up, put up the blinkers
I flow just like sprinklers, give yo ass the middle finger
You better slow your roll baby, you ain't got enough dough to pay me
You know the pin number, just page me when you will baby

[Hook 2x] (w/ Missy ad-libs)

[Intro : Akon]
Akon and B.I.G. yea

[Verse 1 : The Notorious B.I.G.]
Niggas talkin' it but ain't livin' it
Cristal pops I'm sippin' it, mob hats and lizard shit
'Gator trunks bitch, rollin' blunts with the williest of the willy
Heckler Koch, M-1's and nine millies
Stories like a motherfucker
Model bitches wondering if I'm a fuck with her
She know I treats my bitches like Ivana
Dolce and Gabana drippin'
Big Poppa never slippin'
H-class diamonds shinin'
Dinner with the wifey winin', dinin'
Smoking cigars in Bogotá
With Colombian niggas named Panama
And Englique and shit
Games we play life endin'
Bitches bending over with ease
For a pair of Moschino jeans
And Donna Karan tank tops I got your bank stopped
Singles on top
Benjamins
Under the rest of 'em
Advancin'
From duplex to mansion
Stashing keys hidin' G's overseas
VCR's in my V's
Game elevates, money I make
Gets your stocks and real estates, bitch
Jet skiing in the Caribbean, white sands
Discussing plans with my mans
Dark blue land, smoke tint chrome rims and system
That leaves your rear views tremblin'
What you gonna do when poppa catch an attitude?
Drop to your knees and show gratitude
Kiss my rings it's a Frank White thing I stay potent
Bitch is devoted, take my dick and deep throat it

[Hook : Akon]
Eternal sunshine in this elevated world of mine
Looking for this hour glass of time
Trying to find my purpose on this grand design
Is there anybody out there living?
4-5-6 is on the streets, they shootin
Is there any money out there for me?
You just listen to this husler's story

[Verse 2: Big Gee]
Picture me, a product of the zone three
Scared lost, don't know what I'm suppose to be
Shit cost, money never came to me
When shit short, I suffered unshamelessly
The lord humble niggas 'specially if they act like
They too big for they draw when they stacks right
Think I'm bullshittin'? A bunch of niggas back like
Right back hungry, stacks gone, they forgot Christ
I know a nigga sold his soul for a nickel rock
I know some hoes for the dro you can hit the cock
I know a nigga workin' 9-5
Been on 15 years, ain't got a car to drive
I know some nigga wanna act hard, flicks pitch
Fake jack boys, can't rob, get killed
Got kin folk backyard big whips
Escart that lift my homeboy this year

[Hook : Akon]

[Interlude : Akon]
Akon

[Verse 3 : Akon]
While B.I.G. sittin up with Englique
I'm on the coastline politickin' wit Jose
We got the birds flyin' in the coop all day
Tryin' to find a new way to smugglin' pure yay'
We bout our business, ain't no small time thieves
If you ain't growin the 'caine then we ain't gon' meet
See I'm the one to call when things get deep
And my Africans will put yo' main man to sleep, now
And Mexico far from the block
Tryin' to figure out how many Glocks to a box, now
Sellin' arms as well as rocks in my socks
If you could show me the money, here's the keys to the lock, now
Hey, you know the streets is my territory
Ain't scared of nothin, let you fear it for me
Hey, whether win, lose or draw
Believe that death is waitin for all

[Hook : Akon]

[Verse 4 : Scarface]
Face Mob in the buildin (Uh huh)
Niggas is quick to chop rocks and hide hands
Make a break for it, get away from it, that was the plan (but)
So the whole time, I been plottin' on his man
Caught him slippin' and sleepin', I hit his ass wit the can, and
Here's somethin' that you can't understand
How can one be so cold and snatch a nigga's soul? (Damn)
I'm on some get back shit, there comes a time
In every man's mind when it's deeper than dollar signs
I been on the grind, got homies doin' time
Behind niggas actin like bitches and bitches droppin' dimes
I'm duckin' indictments, pussies is wearing wires
Niggas just ain't tellin', no, they know we let it slide
But nah, we gotta ride and him, he gotta die
So if you catch up to his ass before I catch him, give him mine
The rats one thing a real nigga here despise
I'm a five K one killa, I set his ass on fire

Don't take 'em to the crib unless they bonin
Easy, call 'em on the phone and
Platinum Chanel cologne and
I stay dressed to impress
Spark these bitches interest
Sex is all I expect
If they watch TV in the Lex, they know
They know, quarter past 4
Left the club tipsy, say no mo'
Except how I'm gettin home tomorrow
Cease will drop you off when he see his P.O
Back of my mind I hope she swallow
Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Griffin, she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryna wait
Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, "You know what you do to me"
She starts off, "Well I don't usually"
Then I whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South (Ooow)
I threw that back out, in the parking lot
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top
And I don't stop until I squirt
Jeans, skirt, butt-naked - it all work

Rocked them pearl sets, flew in a pearl jet

Blow a chick back like I blow through a trial (take that)
And now you and me can drink some Hennessy
Then we get it on, mad women wantin' to bone Sean Combs
Sippin' on Patron, speedin' be leanin', got 'em fiendin'
Then when I did it to you throw it right back (right back)
And tell me "Yeah Diddy I like it like that" (like that)
Lift your shirt, you know how I flirt

I reach my peak, I can't speak
(A-yo, you listening to me motherfucker?)
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
(Eyo, c'mon nigga)
I'm sick of niggas lying, I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talking
*BANG*
(Ayo Big, ayo Big!)

[Interlude]
*heartbeat slows, sound of ambulance sirens*
*sound of pulse monitor and breathing machine*

[Outro: Puff Daddy]
Damn... we was s'pose to rule the world baby
We was unstoppable!
The shit can't be over, no
The shit can't be over, man
I know you hear me nigga
I know you hear me
You got too much livin' to do
Too much unfinished business
It ain't over
*flatline*
Live your life

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
Can I live 'til my last day?
Hittin' honies that be na-sty
Gettin' money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Yo what's beef to you, three niggas with hoodies and bats
That ain't shit compared to one small cat with gats
When we came here we cut off all kind circulation
Breathin', eatin', the whole situation
When we do our shit we do our shit for real
While you take your money for your deal and make your own beats
Compose your own sheets, that's aight but chill
I'ma spend that mil and cop only hot shit
Rock top shit you know how The LOX get
Then you can see me flyin' in the Bentley cockpit
LOX and B-I, hold our grica down for years
Gang not, but we been had our black tears
Niggas under the stairs only understand what we got
Underground, all above must get shot
You couldn't book me Dano, Sheek Luciano put the burners
To all y'all, what nigga bring it I'm callin' y'all

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
You already know what it's about when I run up in your house
Put the gun up in your mouth and get the money out the couch
Hearin' you out is senseless, perhaps for instance
I give this faggot a french kiss
Black gloves, no prints, dark tints
Word on the street they ain't heard from him since
You know about life after kickin' the kid in
Since me and my mi-dan can flip seven gri-dams
Scri-dam, the flow is forbidden
Either you ridin' or you dyin' 'cause we swingin' iron
LOX and Poppa, turning niggas into Jim Hoffa
Who gon' stop us? Your last joint double copper
You gettin' money or you're runnin' from the Feds
Ain't nothin' over here but 16 with one in the head
And I solemnly swear
That all y'all niggas out there got a problem this year

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
Can I live 'til my last day?
Hittin' honies that be na-sty
Gettin' money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me
Can I live 'til my last day?
Hittin' honies that be na-sty
Gettin' money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me

[Verse 3: Styles P]
Before you think of keepin' me down, heatin' me down
The flow like water get deep and you drown
With no soul, many niggas roll with no goal
Even the small gun got a little black hole
Your destiny is something you can never figure out
Niggas is never happy 'til there's blood up in your mouth
There's a lot of killers, but who the hell are you to blame
There's a lot of dead, how the hell you take the pain?
Live with it, got money, you better give with it
My man had the thug in him, did his bid with it
Get married to the game, but never have a kid with it
Advice from the wise, slice the pies
Too many schemes devised when dreams collide
Teams provide war for the street to absorb
You stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor
Only a blind thug'll fall in love with a whore

[Break: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh, uhh, uhh

[Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Who the fuck wanna squeeze?
My Desert E's make MC's freeze
You wakin' up in cold sweats, they just dreams
You still apologizin'
Analyzin', my size and your size and
Realizin', a fist fight would be asinine
You just pop wines, I must pop nines
Genuine steel piece, nozzle in your grill piece
You're shook up, two bricks, every cook up
We can hook up, all I see is the future
Disrespect, I shoot ya
By the way, them bricks get flipped weekly
Sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
Die for a dollar, nigga, life ain't sweet
Play for keeps, wet shirts with experts on the creep
Our beef is my fiancé, about to marry it
Illegal transactions in Farragut with Arabics
Why not, they fit twelve up in the bedroom
Imagine what they stash is like, make you a classic like
My first LP, beef with me is unhealthy
Fuck around and get an ulcer, loose your pulse or
Collapsed lung, look how many gats I brung
For them homos, still doin' promos
Break both your legs, you're movin' slow-mo
Got shine to glow mo'
Nine hundred and ninety six grams, you need four mo'

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
Can I live 'til my last day?
Hittin' honies that be na-sty
Gettin' money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me
Can I live 'til my last day?
Hittin' honies that be na-sty
Gettin' money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me
Can I live 'til my last day?
Hittin' honies that be na-sty
Gettin' money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me

[Intro: Jim Jones]
R.I.P. Big
We some niggas that's gonna make you proud of this game
Smell me? Jones, Capo
Cash Money, Santana
Dipset, Lil Weezy
Let's ride, Let's ride
Cause real Gs know the feeling
It's hard body, no remorse for the killing
Cause real Gs know the feeling
It's hard body, no remorse for the killing

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Mad trees and bitches in dungarees
The city under seas, kitchen hundred degrees
I love that summer breeze, I'll stand in it 'til it freeze
I'm from another breed, them s-s-southern Gs
I sip promethazine, I lean, I stand tall
I'm mean, I'm mad raw, I'm coming like fastball
Steee-rike, yup, so get it right
Nigga, one of my sniplets'll end your whole life
You ain't nothing but a riblet to a nigga with a knife
And a fork, I'm a pig myself, I eat pork
So be smart and play your own part
If you don't love yourself, I'll make you see your own heart
And we don't like the narcs, stay away from the cell
Hey, I'mma shoot it out if I'm facing the L
Yeah, so tell your girl to come and make me rich
Weezy Baby, nigga, nine to five, ten to six

[Hook: Juelz Santana]
All night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?
I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever and I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever, I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever, it'd be your life before my life
At night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
It's showdown time, throwdown time
Safety off, four pound time
Clack clack, go get yours, I'll go get mine
Check it man, I'm with whatever
Goodness gracious, the paper
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
I'll blow that ass back for fronting on a nigga like me
You got nothing on a nigga like me, you'll see
I'm on the grind from sun up to sun down
If I'm lying, may lightning come down and strike me right now
I'll turn a dollar to a twenty to a fifty to a hundred
Keep it coming 'til I'm full on my stomach
I'm stuck in my ways, I'm stuck puffing my haze
Hand on my pistol, front of it sprays
I'm stuck living the life of a ghetto nigga
Trying to get rid of the life, alright?

[Hook: Juelz Santana]

[All night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?
I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever and I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever, I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever, it'd be your life before my life
At night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?]

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G (not in album version)]
As I grab the Glock, put it to your head piece
One in the chamber, the safety is off, released
Straight at your dome, holmes, I wanna see cabbage
Biggie Smalls the savage
Doing your brain cells much damage
Teflon is the material, for the imperial
Mic gripper, girl stripper, the Henny sipper
I drop lyrics off and on like a light switch
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drop with you
.45 Glocks and Tecs are expected when I wreck shit
Respect is collected, so check it
I got techniques dripping out my butt cheeks
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets
My shit is deep, deeper than my grave, G
I'm ready to die, and nobody can save me
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl
My life is played out like a Jheri curl
I'm ready to die

[Hook: Juelz Santana]

[All night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?
I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever and I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever, I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever, it'd be your life before my life
At night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?]

[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]

[Break: Notorious B.I.G]
This goes out to my Brooklyn crew
Representin' on the freaky freaky
Fuck 'em all day, fuck 'em all night
We don't love these hoes

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I go on and on and on and
Don't take them to the crib unless they bonin'
Easy, call 'em on the phone and
Platinum Chanel cologne and
I stay, dressed to impress
Spark these bitches interest
Sex is all I expect
If they watch TV in the Lex, they know
They know, quarter past 4
Left the club tipsy, say no mo'
Except how I'm gettin' home tomorrow
Caesar drop you off when he see his P.O
Back of my mind I hope she swallow
Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Riffin', she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryna wait
Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, "You know what you do to me"
She starts off, "Well I don't usually"
Then I whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South
Threw that back out, in the parkin' lot
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top
And I don't stop, until I squirt
Jeans, skirt, butt-naked, it all work

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nasty

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I remember we went to Tennessee
Then we came home, mad messages was on my phone
Bitch named Simone
Screamin, she fiendin' for the semen
Me bein' the man that I am
Took it to her condo pronto
Half Indian, I called her Tonto
Roll the chron' chron' in the dark pronto
Few puffs, eyes got low
And off to the bedroom we go
Sex is drama, head is trauma
Ripped pajamas, I'ma stay 'til tomorrow
Satisfyin' all my needs twice
With whipped cream, handcuffs and ice
The bitch is nice, word is bond
Can't wait to put my niggas on, what? What?

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nasty

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Ladies, my Mercedes
Hold fo' in the back, two if you're fat
Keep a gat 'cause cats try fi test me
They just fans like De Niro, Wesley
Let's see, the bitch I'm waitin' on
Gardeur jeans look like they painted on
Ask thee, leave it up to me
Lay her on back ever so gently
She like the way the dough fold up, Rolls roll up
Cristal 'til she throw up, bitch grow up
Hold up, there's DeGenero
Dripped out, Iceberg apparel
Intro goes without speaking
Call me Cease 'cause I keep 'em, we can go freakin'
All weekend, so, roll in
Ain't it good that my Lex seats foldin'? Uhh

[Chorus: Kelly Price]
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty
You nasty boy, nigga you so nasty
You nasty boy, you nasty

But if you lose, don't ask no questions why

Rock it out, baby bubba, to the boogie, the bang-bang
The boogie to the boogie that be

[Skit: 'Prince' Charles Alexander]
God damn it, Voletta, what the fuck are you doin'?
You can't control that God damn boy? What?

What the fuck are you doin'? (Get your black ass the fuck off!)
You can't control that God—

What the fuck do you want me to do?
If— if you can't con— fucking control him

Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy
The weak or the strong
Who got it goin' on?
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong
Who got it goin' on?
You're dead wrong

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Relax and take notes while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke, gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer, motherfucker say your prayers
"Hail Mary, full of grace"
Smack the bitch in the face, take her Gucci bag
And the North Face off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money, oh you got me mistaken, honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like The Vapors
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho
The head honcho, swift fist like Camacho
I got so much style I should be down with the Stylistics
"Make up to break up" Niggas need to wake up
Smell the indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia
She don't remember shit, just the two hits
Her hitting the floor and me hitting the clit
Sucking on the tits, had the hooker begging for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly, love, my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House Of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was Humpin' Around and Jump-in Around
Jacked her then I asked her, "Who's the man?" She said, "B-I-G"
Then I bust in her E-Y-E (Yo Big, you're dead wrong)
Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 2: Eminem]
There's several different levels to Devil worshippin': horse's heads
Human sacrifices, canibalism, candles and exorcism
Animals having sex with 'em, camels, mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit, I just
Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin', meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin'
I got a nine in my pocket, and baby I'm just
Dyin' to cock him
He's ready for war
I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
My uz is as
Heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door
I lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread
Red on the wall
Red on the ceilin', red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, wed on the third, then she's dead on the fourth
I'm dead wrong
Repeat Chorus Twice

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
How many licks does it take to the center of my Tootsie Roll? (Or)
How many nuts to the center of your booty hole?
Hold on, shorty, cause I'm about to slap this groupie nigga
Jab this fluesy nigga, watch 'em bleed, then shit dookie, nigga
Spooky nigga, you gettin' skinny like you Pookie, nigga
Blood spill got you laggin' out like that soupie nigga
Smoke this Lucy nigga, time passin' on the frank mic
Watch 'em dyin' slow, then see ya skin, you start to change color
My goons lay the flood, leave you layin', drippin' blood
Then ended up fingerfuckin' your mother at a strip club
We dead wrong for how we gutter like how in the sudden
Fascinated how all of this street shit, we straight mother
Fuck it
We thug rugged to the tenth power
Like B.I.G. was listenin'
So Gimme The Loot for the past ten hours
Another dick
Hear the click of my gun cock
Same mentality when I was scheeming on a lunch box
Gimme that!
Twenty-focused and I'm sorry Campbell
I'm taking from you and your wife and run the baby Pamper (What?)
Repeat Chorus Til Fade

[Puff Daddy]
Oh shit (What's that man)
I don't know kid, I think it's a party going on
Oh, it's the remix
Check it, yeah muthafuckas
What we about to do right about now (Hey)
We gonna get kinda funky
I am the Puff Daddy
And I'm rolling with my man Biggie Smalls
Mary J. Blige and K-Ci from Jodeci
And we about to do something new
And we about to
Check it, say what, say what

[Chorus: Biggie and Mary J. Blige]
Hey yo, what's the 411, hun?
(What's the 411, hun?)
I know you got it going on
(Hey yo, I got it going on)
Hey yo, what's the 411, hun?
(What's the 411, hun?)
I know you got it going on
(Hey yo, I got it going on)

[Biggie]
As I sit back relax
Steam a blunt, sip a Becks
Think about the sexy singers that I wanna sex
I'd probably go to jail
For fucking Patti LaBelle
Ooh Regina Belle, she'd probably do me swell
Jasmine Guy was fly
Mariah Carey's kinda scary
Wait a minute, what about my honey Mary?
Them jeans, they fittin' like a glove
I had a crush on you since "Real Love"
Hold your horses
I'm a show ya who the boss of intercourse is
Sex, I'm taking no losses
Even groups like SWV and TLC
Can't see B.I.G. with telepathy
The recipe, a picture hardcore with a gun
Pimpin' ain't easy but it's always fun
When it comes to nuts, I bust 'em one by one
So what's the 4-1-1, hun?

[Chorus: Biggie and Mary J. Blige]
Hey yo, what's the 411, hun?
(What's the 411, hun?)
I know you got it going on
(Hey yo, I got it going on)
Hey yo, what's the 411, hun?
(What's the 411, hun?)
I know you got it going on
(Hey yo, I got it going on)

[Mary J. Blige]
Yeah nigga, what makes you better than the next nigga?
Seen you last week and your black ass couldn't speak
You try to play like Mr. all of that
But now you wanna come to me with some chit-chat
I don't have no time for no wham-bam thank you ma'am
Gas me up, get me drunk and hit the skins and scram
The same old shit you pulled last week on Pam
I'm not having it, no, I'm not having it
You got to do a lot more and it's just how it be
I'm Mary Blige and you just ain't running up in me
I need a man who's looking out with some security
So come correct with some respect, and then we'll see
So if you with it, then drop the 7-digits
And I might just give you a call (Damn)
If you ain't with it then don't waste your time at all
Biggie Smalls, and you don't stop

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige + K-Ci]
All my love is all I have (Yeah, something to funk to)

We gonna get hardcore on these homos

Like I said before, Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique, hard-core
Uh, representing, Biggie Smalls in the house, uh, check it, uh
Biggie Smalls is the wickedest
Niggas say I'm pussy, I dare you to stick your dick in this
If I was pussy I'd be filled with syphilis
Herpes, gonorrhea, chlamydia, getting rid'a ya
Got it locked like the penitentiary
Niggas mention me for MC execution
Who ya choosin, the wack MC
Or the Black Fat MC
Jack Dempsey will start shaking
All it's taking, is some marijuana and I'm making
MCs break fast, like flap-jacks and bacon
Back spins, the windmills, who's still the gin-drinker
Ill-thinker, exploding when the paper hits the ink-ugh
Take the Gangster Chronicles, turn to page 6-6-6
Holocaust, B.I.G. the merciless
Niggas press they luck-and
They get a butt-fuckin
Straight up the ass
Raw dog with the rash
And I don't fuck with the condoms
The condoms is a problem from the AIDS getting sprayed
Diseases, B.I.G. pleases
MCs across the seas is just the way, I crush my prey, hey
I'm crazy and deranged
Blowing niggas out the frame, simple and plain
But getting back, to the black rhinoceros of rap
B.I.G. took a loss, how preposterous is that, nigga
Recognize
Notorious Biggie Smalls, '94 Ready To Die

[Intro]
Chill Twan, damn man!
That nigga Big got somethin to say?
Yo Big, what'chu got to say Big?
Yeah, yeah
Special shoutout to my man
MC Homicide and DJ Fatal
Twin one and two my man Milk
My man Fred Dawg, the O.G.B. crew
Y'all know how we flow
And I'ma drop it like this y'all

[Verse 1]
Oh what a feeling! Drivin' in my four by four
Girlies galore, B.I.G. on the door
Chrome trimming with the smoke tint
Givin' chumps a hint as I count my mint
Stacks of doves, half my man's is C-note
All from sayin' rhymes that B.I.G. wrote
Blunt, I take a toke, but only if it's weed
Skunk with no seeds, a sip of Hennessy
Pass to D or maybe movin' solo
Never with a skeezer by my side, that's a no-no
Tell me I ain't the flyest nigga that you ever saw
Live in action, guaranteed raw!

[Interlude]
Who's coming through? Y'all know who! (Who?!)

[Verse 2]
Bed-Stuy Brooklyn where this rapper was originated
Your rhymes ain't shit; they must be constipated
Many awaited the heavyset brother from Fulton Street
To drop a rhyme to a funky beat
Expellin MCs as if I was at Sarah J
Or boys and girls at any school around the way
Opponents, pupils, but I'm the principal
Hard to beat, damn near invisible
Niggas wanna know, how I live the mack life
Makin money smoking mics like crack pipes
Flippin' bombs, stayin' calm, givin' my people my palm
And sayin' rhymes is an opium bomb
Yes it's me, the B.I.G
Competition ripper ever since 13
Used to steal clothes, was considered a thief
Until I started hustlin' on Fulton Street
Makin' loot, knockin' boots on the regular
Pass the microphone I'm the perfect competitor
Jewels and all that, my clothes is all that
Chumps steppin' to me, that's where they took a fall at!
B.I.G. without burner, that's unheard of
I stay close to mine like Tina on Turner
Quick to smother a punk motherfucker
Undercover, word to mother, I'm above ya
And I love ya 'cause you're a sweet bitch
A crazy crab, ya might make my dick itch
I flow looser than Luther, words ya get used ta
B.I.G. is a born, trooper
Like ice cream I scoop ya, my music you wanna get loose ta
Stay dipped and I'm not a booster
So what'cha got to say? This mackin' word is bond
There's no other assumption, I got it goin' on
I'm not conceited, my friends tell me this
Even my mother be noddin' her head to this
Makes her proud to see her one son get loud
Flip on a sucker and bow to the crowd
Drink a little Hennessy, smoke a blunt or 2 or 3 or 4
Live in action, guaranteed RAW
Round two the rhyme regulator here to roast ya
As ya follow this yeah, I gave a toast to ya crew
See, they popped on ya like a kernel
They didn't realize that the beef was eternal
Internal injury that's what you're soon to see
B.I.G. keeps company
Sometimes in my waist, if Jake come, I'm boatin'
Run upstairs, change my skimmer and my coat and
I'll be floatin' to your punk part of town
Anybody fronting, they better duck down
Don't get mad 'cause I grazed ya
You jumped in that 4-door Blazer, quick I couldn't get a good hit
Shit, I was aimin' for the melon
But the kick of my three-pound auto there's no tellin'
Drink a little Hennessy, smoke a blunt or 2 or 3 or 4
Live in action, guaranteed raw!

[Outro]
And you don't stop, and you don't stop
You keep on
To my man Milk, and Thai
Like I said before the whole O.G.B. is in full effect
Most definitely
Sent a shout on

[Notorious B.I.G.]
A whole lotta niggas want Big to make a demo tape
'Specially that, BUM-ASS NIGGA uhh
This goin out to you nigga recognize
Yo 50, what's this?

Microphone murderer, mass mayhem maker
B.I.G.'s on the mic, call the undertaker
Make an appointment, schedule a interview
Because you know what Big Man's about to do
50 Gran' on the Technic at the right peak
Brothers wanna hear the words Big Man speak
The microphone - I'm rippin', the burner got the clip in
Slammin MC's like Scottie Pippen
Flippin on Old Gold, cold as the rhymes you stole
Puffin on dime bags and I been told
My words are harder than a brick, Chinese arithmetic
A thick stick and my dick
Makes me sick when you pick the whick-whack rhyme G
You get what you pumpin is Tic-Tac time Z
B.I.G. moves swifter than a ninja
Even on stickups I'm the masked avenger
Keep my eyes open and the case closed
No eyewitnesses, no names are exposed
Just the heavyset one with the big gun
And a sweet tongue shakin down everyone
Loot like Michael Jackson kicks like Bo Jackson
Benz like Freddie Jackson, no need to ask in the crew
Oooh! No frontin, no fakin moves
Fightin or fuckin, resort to the stick and move
Smack the fool that disagree, recognize the pedigree
Rhyme is mine cause I said it's me
Step to a Big Man grippin the mic stand
Keep a bankroll and so do 50 Gran'
And, I give you my hand cause you deserve a pound
Tryin to blow up the spot, in my part of town
Braves, because you get no praise
I treat you like a derelict with AIDS
Recognize, I don't fuck with the St. Ides
B.I.G. down with O.G.B
Old Gold Brothers for the others that missed me
The crew stay deep on Bedford and Quincy
Rhymes in the pocket for a quick hand to hand
You want it to be on, there's a Tec in the garbage can
I pull bitches like Kim Fields, Brooke Shields
Shelley Long, Connie Chung, I can go on and on
Word is bond I'm a don~!
I split 'em and run up in 'em I fuck 'em and then I duck 'em
I hit 'em in the shitter and forget her, and it gets better
B.I.G. are the letters
Niggas know the pedi'...
That's the end!! What you want me to do? DAMN~!

[Intro]
Yo Bigs, man, what's wrong man?
You look like you got problems man

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Hey yo man, psh man..
It's this fuckin' bitch, man!
Shit, I know I ain't s'posed to have no feelings for these hoes out here man, but
This bitch on the back of my mind man (word?)
Yeah man... done wrote a rhyme 'bout the bitch man
(Let me hear it) Want me to drop the drama kid? (Yeah)

Yeah, dedicatin this to you man
Cause my man 50 Grand told me straight up and down man
I ain't 'sposed to love NO ho
Knahmsayin? I tried to tell her 50
I got three rules in life
I'm not to be played with, played on or played out
I'mma drop it like this

[Verse One]
Lyin' in my bed, I'm lookin' at four walls
Echo in my head sayin' I got a lot of gall
Grippin' my cap, my pen in my teeth
Thinkin' what this ho said, she called me a thief
She said I stole her heart, and didn't leave a trace
I told her I was sorry, and she said "get out my face"
Walked out my door with my Walkman in my pocket
Playin "Love Is a House," and thinkin how she jocked it
When she had the key, to open up my door
Adore, that Prince scan that bought me on the floor
I know that she loved me, I couldn't ever fake it
I say go buy a pie, the girl would go bake it
Makin' a record was important to me
More important than her that's what made her flee, see
The mistake was not payin' no mind
All her posse said we was "two of a kind"
I call her back twice, your sister said you're broke
She said "when you left, your ears was full of smoke
Chokin' on a cigarette, you don't even smoke!"
Jumped in the train station put in a token
Coulda been my partner, amigo, my peer
Just waitin' for them three words that all girls wanna hear
"I love you," huh, you would start to cry, if
I would reply with I.L.Y
Then I tell your friends that you played me out
Said I wouldn't say "I love you" just to make you shout
So I, call up 7 digits that would pick up your phone
Your sister picked it up and said that you wasn't home
I heard you in the back cryin' up a storm
Screamin' how you wish that I never was born
"I hate him! I hate him!" That's what she kept sayin
She'll come to her senses is what I kept prayin'
But now I'm gonna lay the cards on the line
Just say that you hate me, or say that you're mine
I said, when I played ball you was in the stands
When I was sick, you held my hand
It was hard to say before, but now I can
Bitch, I love no ho, fuck ya!

[Interlude:]
I don't give a fuck about'cha
Take a long walk off a short pier, bitch
Tryna to take bankrolls
Bum bitches outta here 50, man
Now check this

[Verse Two]
Come to my crib, she say, "B.I.G. listen
I don't like the way you been dissin'"
Feel like I been kissin' other bitches cause my lips feel chapped
I tell you "it's from the blunts," you ain't tryin to hear that
Now I'm Henny'd like a fuck? What's the riff?
Who I'm sleepin with? I ain't got the time
To shoot the gift to hoes, I'm tryin to take bankroll
I ain't fuckin nobody, case closed
You hit the lights and decide to doze off
No kiss goodnight, didn't take your clothes off
And my dick is harder than a rock
Nobody to cockblock but you's a hardrock
The fuck you think I am, gay?
I ain't got no time to play I ain't got nothin' to say
Bounce out the crib, just to see my man 50
And what's up with B.I.G
And the O.G.B., you know they keep plenty hookers
And I ain't a bad looker
So I see one ho that I like yeah, oooh
Shit is cool

[Outro: The Notorious B.I.G., ?]
Trust no hoes, all they want is bankroll
That's what I'm tryin to tell you now baby
My man 50 done schooled me to all y'all hookers
Knahmsayin? I ain't lame to this
Can't spell game without me, the B.I.G

[Intro]
A-yeah!
Bad Boy in the house for the '95
Big shout out to my man Mel Smith
To my man Don Cee Shan in the house
What's up Michelle Ray, what's up boo?

[Verse 1]
Sick of mama screamin' that "Get a job, nigga"
Pressed to the limit, got to rob me a nigga
Simple and plain, my man scooped me in the hooptie (uh-huh)
Whispered in his ear "This is what we got to do, G"
Got to bang a nigga and bang a nigga good
So I can cop a Benz and drive the fuck out the hood (uh-huh)
'Cause baby-mama screamin', "Your daughter 12 months"
Can't live life slingin' rocks and smokin' blunts (ugh)
Hangin' with the niggas don't pay the bills
And being broke at 30 give a nigga the chills
So what we gotta do is creep and see a sweet vic
Yo, you see that shit? (Hell yeah, I see that shit)
Colombian, Dominican, yeah whatever
Whoever he was, he had it tucked under the leather
Two keys, 20 Gs, nigga, please!
Blew his brains out 'cause witnesses, we don't leave

[Chorus]
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging with the bitches is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging with the bitches is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things, ugh!
And the saga continues, uh

[Verse 2]
After mad blunts and gin we had the plan made
I bought my wifey a crib, I bought the MAFIA an arcade
Mad games: pool tables and candy (uh-huh)
A little extra trickin' loot be comin' in handy
Check it, got on some '95 shit, sold the 5, bought the 6
Del Vec, copped the Lex, we was set (ugh!)
Nino had work all in the projects
Niggas slingin' O's he kept the profit
No one could stop it, we was livin it up
All the sexy young bitches stressin', givin' it up
Same bitches suckin' dick, tryin' their best to thrill me
Said the niggas I killed is out to kill me
Soon as she spoke, on that note, I saw trenchcoats
One had a MAC spittin', all I saw was gunsmoke
The other had a shotty, I was shootin' everybody
And I wasn't missin' (ugh), had to get out this position
Niggas still hittin', feeling hot ones in my back
Licked six shots, smoked the nigga with the MAC
The nigga with the shotty still bustin', cussin'
Maricóns and putas, all I'm tryin to do is shoot ya
Two shots in the Ruger, booyah! Blew his ass out
Then I passed out (passed out, passed out)

[Chorus]
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging with the bitches is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging with the bitches is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things (ugh, ugh)

[Break]
And the saga continues
Bad Boy in the house, for the '95 piece
Real niggas, aight

[Interlude]
Yo check it
Call Lil Cease, tell that motherfucker to bring me some motherfucking weed to this hospital
Fuck that, tell Uncle Paulie to go pick up ten thousand from Dez and go take about 20 Gs from Nino
Tell that motherfucker to get this nigga next door up out of here, that nigga be snoring all night, I can't sleep
And call that big butt nurse with the long hair to come suck my dick, ugh!

[Verse 3]
The doctor said I need about three weeks of recovery
(Ugh!) But the nurses is lovin' me
Sayin' the best part of the day is my half
Feedin' me breakfast and givin' me a sponge bath (ugh)
Niggas say I died dead in the streets
Nigga, I'm gettin' high, gettin' head on the beach
Chillin (ugh!), sittin on about half a million
With all my niggas, all my guns, all my women
Next two years, I should see about a billion (yeah)
All for the love of drug dealing (ugh!)
Got no love for the other side, fuck them tricks (yeah)
Any repercussion, Junior M.A.F.I.A. spit clips
All the time, Big Poppa kick the raw rhyme (yeah)
Raw flows, and that's how it goes

[Chorus]
On the road to riches and diamond rings (yeah)
Real niggas do real things
Hanging with the bitches is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging with the bitches is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things, ugh!

[Verse 1: Masada]
Mahogany Team Queens up on the rise
Be careful, watch your back, blackbirds don't wear disguise
How we comin, comin hard.. camels too slow
Stick up kids do anything, hustlers keep loot to show (what?)
The game is hot you could never be a winner
Just begun a game so considered a beginner
Masada for real, this shorty here is here to stay
Mahogany go platinum after that we just parlay
I'm from the Bricks we get kicks, offa loud gun shot licks
Fuck stones and sticks, loudmouths get nixed
This life is plush I be the bill-be-board, Scarface want
Italiano, I'm the real McCoy, nigga what?
Can't be a joke I've been through too many games
Niggas laugh, but my expression wasn't hardly the same
Show me respect cause it's due, you keep the fear
Cause I'll get over and believe I'll come back at you

[Hook: Masada + Rico Wade]
Mamacita, papadonna
Mamacita, papadonna
Mamacita, papadonna
Mamacita, papadonna

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Yo, now, you and your nigga shit shaky
And at the time your heart feel down and broke like Achy Breaky
Lump in your throat, feel like a trachea, oh dummy
The pain that's in your chest done made it's way down to your tummy
You wide open, you start smokin' with your girl
She nigga-bashin', sayin', "You don't need em in your world, niggas all dogs!"
If niggas all dogs, then what you call broads?
Felines in heat, meowin for some yarn balls
Now you and her done got to drankin'
Oh now it's really crunk, cause y'all silly drunk and your girl done got to thinkin'
She talkin bout, "Girl you look so beautiful"
You say, "thank you," bein' nice, you try to change the subject
Want some beans and rice? But she's back at you like a pit
Mixed with a chihuahua, how much meaner can you get?
Don't let her have her way with you, she's gonna have a fit
You're the candy apple of her eye and bout to get bit
Here's what you do -- you
Grab her by her neck, throw her on the wall
Say, "Bitch don't ever disrespect me, never not at all"
These simple words can put a pause to half of the applause
Then black ball laws of balance at all cost

[Hook: Masada + Rico Wade]
Mamacita, papadonna
Mamacita, papadonna
Mamacita, papadonna
Mamacita, papadonna

[Verse 3: WitchDoctor]
Que pasa, que pasa? Check this out
Quiet nights like this, might twist one for the mota
On the balcony, I got a sofa
Nights like this is perfect, for this Spanish Fly
Can you come over, somethin, I wanna show ya
Told ya once we was gon' take a trip, touch you
With my lips where you like it, it's time, don't fight it
Piggy-back ride to the sofa, in the microwave
I got your favorite Stouffer's, lasagna, that's how much
I want ya, fuck flowers
The ceremony starts from the shower with the water
I got somebody's daughter in the Doctor headquarters, chillin
Prepare for this sex drillin, she said somethin in Spanish
Got me feelin mannish, me and you fin' ta vanish
Real quick, feel this shit, got cheese, tryin to make cheese
To get you pregnant overseas
Maybe make sho' that's my seed
Quiet nights like this, bachelor like me is single
Talkin to you Miss Bilingual
Let's mingle in the crowd, watch them show, pop some Moet
Tryin to get you so wet, never been to Spain
Never been a lame, horny, ever since I been a tiny
Fuckin with niggas with ageless bodies
Talkin to me, while I squeeze it bare
Let me talk to you while I run my fingers through your hair

[Hook: Masada + Rico Wade]
Mamacita, papadonna

But they choosin
Better get in where you fit in cause it's crucial
I'm tryin to cut bout two of them girls
Cause that just what I'm used to
I mean that
The first that look my way just gon' get splack packed
From the front to the back this cognac got my throat burnin like burlap
Everybody cheesin, knowin these hoes gon' cut like Pleasers
These hookers they praisin my crew
Like Reverend Hodo be praisin Jesus
The easiest was the meanest, but the skeezer was a beanie
She thought we was some motherfuckin genies
So I checked her, like the king I am, no disrespect intended
Told her, and her silly friends
"Get out" before they got offended
To the La Quinta we went, layin them hoes down
On the freestyle tip, geyeah!

(Yeah) Yeah, yeah, yeah (Woo), rrah

[Chorus: André 3000]
Old school players to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumping like kangaroos
We'll skew it on the bar-b, we ain't tryin to lose
Say, "I'll be goddamned if they done changed the rules"
Old school players to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumping like kangaroos
We'll skew it on the bar-b, we ain't tryin to lose
Say, "I'll be goddamned if they done changed the rules"

[Verse 1: André 3000]
The common denominator, the nigga numerator
Never know who the hater, niggas cater to your ego
I'm sorry like Atari, who's the cousin to Coleco
Vision, caught a RICO, back on the street like Chico
DeBarge, he large and got a 'Lac in the garage
Few parts here and there, I declare hard
My Lord, one at Clark, one at Spelman
Both know each other and it's cool, you can tell when
He step off in the party, women jump for joy
But all the wild niggas scheming, they gon' jump the boy
For spittin' all that bourgeoi', "My watch, my car"
I'm a star, I'd rather be a comet by far (Rrah, rrah)

[Chorus: André 3000]
Old school players to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumping like kangaroos
We'll skew it on the bar-b, we ain't tryin to lose
Say, "I'll be goddamned if they done changed the rules"
Old school players to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumping like kangaroos
We'll skew it on the bar-b, we ain't tryin to lose
Say, "I'll be goddamned if they done changed the rules"

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Deliver this through your audio, ghetto mafioso
Grow hydro, then bag it up slow
Price that, longevity suggest make moves slow
Take time, grow eight, react nine, blow
Hydro slide raw like fuck Ronaldo
Fly ride, though, shit lookin' wild dope
Then glide, yo, flippin' the page, I go
Watch five-o, jump on my meat, ride slow
Watch those undercovers, cop those, rock those
Glock blows, leave 'em baggy and collect, spot closed
Keep a watch froze, lean on the yacht, wash clothes
Let the chop blow, bag a half a block, plot grows, what?

[Chorus: André 3000]
Old school players to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumping like kangaroos
We'll skew it on the bar-b, we ain't tryin to lose
Say, "I'll be goddamned if they done changed the rules"
Old school players to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumping like kangaroos
We'll skew it on the bar-b, we ain't tryin to lose
Say, "I'll be goddamned if they done changed the rules"

[Verse 3: Big Boi & André 3000]
Boy, I bust raps like D-boys bust gats, shit
We the type of people that don't bury the axe
Or the hatchet, every time we see your link, we snatch it
Ridin' 'round our hood talkin' that dumb shit, your cabbage
Is cracked like plumber's ass and summer's grass
I been in the game for a minute, seen some suckas like y'all passin'
Thinkin' you're light skinned, aight then, lil' boy why you frightened?
The Dungeon Family gon' be here, nigga, so keep writing
I gotta hit The Source, I need my other half a mic
Because that Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was a classic, right
College Park, East Point and Decatur they got my back, so
We gon' keep on jammin' and stabbin' off in the track, I
Think it's time to bungee, but buddy we will be back
And I'm fin' to put some D's on the 'Lac, know dat (Rrah)

[Chorus: André 3000]
Old school players to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumping like kangaroos
We'll skew it on the bar-b, we ain't tryin to lose
Say, "I'll be goddamned if they done changed the rules"
Old school players to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumping like kangaroos
We'll skew it on the bar-b, we ain't tryin to lose
Say, "I'll be goddamned if they done changed the rules"
Old school players to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumping like kangaroos
We'll skew it on the bar-b, we ain't tryin to lose
Say, "I'll be goddamned if they done changed the rules"
Old school players to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumping like kangaroos
We'll skew it on the bar-b, we ain't tryin to lose
Say, "I'll be goddamned if they done changed the rules"

[Verse 1: T-Mo]
Piece by piece, this puzzle comes together
Sever your ties with the bad guys, let the lies go
If you wanna be a ho, go 'head and don't be scared
Many a bitch, represents, and is led
Whichever way no I'm not gay
And really don't give a fuck bout what you doin
Long as I pave the way
For my Southwest GA warriors
To come in packs, to feed, takin what we need
To succeed, you know what we gon' do, on this road
We gon' explode, now are you ready for this territory
Makin our life one big story to tell
Reality amongst the youth, long as, breath is in my body
I got proof, I'm not scared

If you scared, say you scared

[Verse 2: Gipp]
Who's scared?
In this world I'm Gipp, in second the mutant
The third the Geechee, how many ways can you reach me?
Now most be scully, went from clean to muddy
Polished to shine, the season to rhyme
Been down like brown, like dirt to the ground
Been lookin for love, now I bubble like suds
Others flew sky high, while others were duds
Live high up on the hills, to escape the floods
Situation they change, like faces and names
Went from cool to plain, from lame to flame
Man down or not, man plans or plots
Give a FUCK what you think, we ain't movin out this spot
And I'm out
If you scared, say you scared

[Verse 3: André 3000]
Yo, paragraph indent, I make intense sense
Niggas on that Gil Scott dope—hint, hint
At age fifteen they start smokin' Billy Clint'
Now he's twenty-one and wants to know where the time went
Hey, hey, hey, what's the haps? Well see your time elapsed
Have you ever thought of the meaning of the word trap?
Baboon on your back, but what's sad is that crack
Was introduced to Hispanic communities and blacks
But then it spread to white and got everyone's undivided attention
'Cause your daughter is on it and you can't hide it
Maybe your son tried it
Rehab too crowded
You scared, she scared, they scared, I said
They scared they scared to talk about it
Bout it, bout it, bout it, bout it, bout it

If you scared, say you scared

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
February 1st, 1975's my birthdate
The player the B-O-I, was brought onto this Earth on Thursday
I think see, my cap I twist it back from all the dank
But if you see me on the Ave, you betta believe I tote that shank
So what y'all thought, bruh?
I gotta protect my name and what we fought for
Southernplayalistic ATLiens in your sock drawer
No lockjaw, we got that raw shit and all the trimmings
Even though we got two albums, this one feel like the beginning
The intro, the Goodie—we kinfolk
Nigga, it's fin to jump off
But now it's time I lay low
'Cause I believe the track gon' cut off
Psych, the track is bumpin' like pussies on some dykes
So if you scared, say you scared, 'cause everybody can die tonight
'Cause my heart don't pump no Slushee
You touch my niggas you touch me
I blow up the microphone, like Marilyn Manson
You can't hush me, yeah

[Verse 5: Khujo]
Heat'll make anything move
Even Tyson, can get laid down, with this tool
Just cause the name say Goodie, you take us for fools
Out they rabbit ass mind, don't give me mine
I go off like mines, blowin suckers to smithereens
We was never folks if we fell out over this lil' cream
Or let some soft legs come in between our dreams
We live like Kings, and die like fuckin' men
I don't care how rough you roll, we can't be shut down
Ain't no openin' up shop, we already established
You lap doggin', we boss hoggin
Grown men, don't beg for attention
Keep wishin', high heels clickin'
Paper champions, leavin' with they feet behind
Zap em for the pumpkin, at twelve
On the bottom bunk, holla at me
Six to the left, last one, can't turn over with dirt on ya
Slain dead, devils, don't have enough to purchase my essence
In da head, missin ounces, zip code, eight miles
Suckas, think I got they package
But they still eatin moo-moo, oink-oink
And fowl-fowl-fowl-fowl.. *repeats*

The truth hurts, but you can't be scared of it
So remember that, OutKast, Goodie Mo-B
Still standin for somethin while y'all fallin for nothin
Stop dyin over this lil concrete and lil paper
We get this shit together our power's in numbers
You can deny the lie but you can't deny the truth
You scared, you scared, say you scared!

[Verse 1: Backbone]
From front to back street, listen, we on a mission
To get right, workin' street corner in the midnight
Picture the scene, these fiends with five
Ten dollar dreams, scheme, for a sack of that, believe that
I'm wit' whateva like Wheatstraw
Stuck servin' my cocaine raw
Drop sixty-two off the brick, jump back
Twenty over, now that's mo' money to get
Slick, we fin' to lick on this corner without gettin' caught
But time, keep a sleepin' and money gettin' short
Plus that crooked cop Brock think we blow slangin' (fuck him)
That why he ride through the hole with the do' swangin'
But I make moves, shake them tricks up out they shoestrings
Be more precise when we do things
'Cause life is like shakin' the dice, but I buck back twice
Like five-deuce, fo'-trey, okay

[Hook: Backbone]
I'm strictly stressin' dirty dirty
Gon' represent it to the T-top
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin' "Hootie Hoo!" when we see cops
I'm strictly stressin' dirty dirty
Gon' represent it to the T-top
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin' "Hootie Hoo!" when we see cops

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Shit, cops and robbers, niggas be bound to get them dollars and cents
They get in a slump like baseball players when they short on they rent
Anything goin', you ain't knowin' how much money you spent
But in the real world you surrounded by these ladies and gents
Who hang around you 'cause you be buyin' all the weed and all the chicken
Feedin' everybody, smokin' 'em out
When you was broke though they was missin'
Now you ridin' 'bout fo' deep, startin' to tear up your suspension
And your baby mamma on child support, my fault, forget to mention
You don't even have a checking account wasn't thinking about no pension
I used to work at Steak 'N' Ale, Old Gold off in the kitchen
Had determination and graduated, now I got the whole rap world fascinated
I wanted a piece of the pie for me and my family so I made it
Continue to sell dope, it's payin' the bills so you gon' do it
But legislation got this new policy: three strikes and you're ruined
Now where your crew at? Yeah

[Hook: Backbone]
I'm strictly stressin' dirty dirty
Gon' represent it to the T-top
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin' "Hootie Hoo!" when we see cops
I'm strictly stressin' dirty dirty
Gon' represent it to the T-top
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin' "Hootie Hoo!" when we see cops

[Verse 3: Cool Breeze]
Ay, me and my buddy on the cut and they know we servin' 'em slabs
We better watch what we doing, and look out for Joe Nab
And quit re-ing up and standing on this same old block
Before our gangsta-ass partner get both of us shot
Niggas talkin' 'cause they making some flow
But still ain't did nothin' that ain't been done befo'
You can't be trying to showcase, just put it down for your spot
And improvise and work with that little you got
So I think when I finish selling my last sack
I'ma take some of this money, go and give some back
'Cause people won't forget about the time you gave, knowmsayin'?
And start thinkin' 'bout a path to pave

[Hook: Backbone]
I'm strictly stressin' dirty dirty
Gon' represent it to the T-top
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin' "Hootie Hoo!" when we see cops
I'm strictly stressin' dirty dirty
Gon' represent it to the T-top
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin' "Hootie Hoo!" when we see cops

[Outro: Big Boi]
This is uh… a lil'… tune that we composed back on the first album
I know a lot of y'all, uh, playas out there thought we wasn't gon' come back at y'all with this thang here, but… it go a lil' some' like this!

[Intro: André 3000]
Woo, woo
Yosky-wosky, peesky-weesky
What'cha wanna do-ski?
Nathaniel
Niggas get jacked like Daniel
Something I can't handle
Yo, unkay

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Yo, this is my story, this is my song
And to them rudypoots don't attempt to try this at home
It's just a poem until y'all learn right from wrong
Know when to bless a situation, when to grab the chrome
But it's back on, another stormy night in Atlanta, Georgia
Overcast, but on behalf of OutKast, I cordially
Invite you to an emotion-filled theater
Bring your umbrellas, 'cause young fella it gets no weirder

[Hook: André 3000]
We reign, reign, supreme, 'preme
Dungeon, dungeon kings
Do you know what brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole?
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied
Now hold on, my brother, no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride
Do you know what brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole?
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied
Now, now just hold on, my brother, no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride

[Break: OutKast]
You are now about entering the fifth dimension of ascension
Our only intention is to take you high
High, yeah, yeah, my Lord

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
To make one bob they head would be the track job
Your job's to spit that fire
Some of y'all MC's take this rhymin' for granted, I won't comply
With that slackin', poppin' and crackin' fourth ward say we snappin'
They want that hardness that oddness that gets a nigga to start this
What's happenin', see if do what you won't do today boy
Will I live tomorrow like you can't even live 'cause you strayed
Motivational skills lackin', when I see you nigga you packin'
Understand that though, you behind a $75,000 car doe
But still stay with mom though, playing the King like Don doe
You choked up, you was the nigga that supposed to be so locced up
Makin' them think Hip Hop is dead, exhume the body if you ain't scared
And if I see you in the streets I'd dap you down like you was Greg, yeah

[Hook: André 3000]
We reign, reign, supreme, preme, dungeon, dungeon kings
Do you know what brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole?
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied
Now hold on, my brother, no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride
Do you know what brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole?
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied
Now, now just hold on, my brother, no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride

Do you know what brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole?
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied
Now hold on, my brother, no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride

Do you know what brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole?
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied
Now, now just hold on, my brother, no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride

[Outro: Kid (of Kid 'n' Play)]
And the winner is—ladies, help me out—OutKast!
(Crowd erupts)

[Big Boi]
Goodie Mob in the house. Yeah, word, what's up? Goodie Mob in the house, yanamsayin'. We wanna say what's up to New York, yanamsayin', 'cause we from Down South, namsayin'. Is New York up in this, yanamsayin'? Are y'all in here, yanamsayin'?
This y'all city, yanamsayin'. We just wanna say—yanamsayin'—wanna say what's up to all the original MCs out there, people out there that who got their own stuff. So what's up, Dré?

[André 3000]
Yeah, first of all, yanamsayin', I wanna thank God. Just—namsayin'—dead serious. 'Cause if it wasn't for him, yanamsayin', we wouldn't be here. But it's like this though: I'm tired of folks, yanamsayin'—them closed-minded folks, yanamsayin'. It's like we got a demo tape and don't nobody wanna hear it
But it's like this, the South got somethin' to say. That's all I got to say

[Skit]

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Me and everything around me is unstable like Chernobyl
Ready to go at any moment, jumping like a pogo stick
Life never lived up to my expectations, so I accept the patience
Expect the worse, but now I'm pacin' back and forth
Inside, I'm melting like water on wicked witches
A monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences
I had the best of life in my clenches, but monkey wrenches was thrown
Like chairs kings sit on, my prayers seem too long
I fall asleep before the ending, don't even get to say "amen"
I hope He understands I be on bended knees
At times, I think I'm crazy, then I say "forget it"
Or maybe it's the devil infiltrating and, like Riddick
Bowe, I've been fighting this since them fetus days
I count from one to twenty, when I'm through, repeat the phrase
"It's just a phase, it's gon' all pass", but that gets old too
I'm weakenin' like a deacon doing dirt
What am I s'posed do?

[Hook: André 3000 & (ShaJuanna Edghill)]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh (Planets and stars)
Uh uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh uh (Earth, Jupiter, Mars)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh (Clothes, hoes, cars)
Uh uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh uh (It's who you are)

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
See, from bedknobs to broomsticks, we lookin' to start some new shit
I'm writing this rhyme in faith, so when you hear it, hope you true it
My nigga, you do it like swooshes, the lyrical cleanse and new sense
Wiping away your germs and filling your craniums with juices
See, Mo goes on, my slick flow flows on
Straight from West Savannah, Georgia, but the S.W.A.T.S. is my home
Never go wrong, 'cause the click is tighter than gnat ass and that bad
Mosquito, now we goes, "I'm proud of you people
For selling your crack in sacks, I'm glad I'm white, not black"
Shit, on the real, that's how them mighties really act
When your back was turned, them slackers learned and now we fallin' apart
You lookin' me in my eye, but you ain't feelin' me in your heart
Yes, yes, Lord, give me the power, we live in the final hour
These niggas, they leavin' me stranded like Rapunzel in the tower
Now or never, let's stick together and overcome
But they don't feel like marching, 'cause they shoes is overrun
Ain't that a bitch?

[Hook: André 3000 & (ShaJuanna Edghill)]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh (Planets and stars)
Uh uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh uh (Earth, Jupiter, Mars)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh (Clothes, hoes, cars)

Clothes, hoes, cars
It's who you are

Uh uh uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh uh (It's who you are)
Planets and stars
Earth, Jupiter, Mars
Clothes, hoes, cars
It's who you are

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
In the zone like Keyser Söze, always the Usual Suspect
No check, all I got in this game is my respect
And Southern pride, I'd be, checking my fucking head
Scared, looking up in your face, boy, I see dead
If you test like SAT, then I guess that we may be
Enemies in the P's, freestyles be freebies
I be that wrong nigga to fuck with, wouldn't I?
Wouldn't I be the wrong one to try, never eating chicken thighs
Only the twenty piece mojo, flows on like Flo Jo
I wanted to figure out, just how low could your hoe go
The beat hit like Beat Street, Krush Groove and Breakin'
Never baking, rebuking Satan, we had you waiting
For the Second Coming, funny how time flies when you're rhyming
LaFace Records, I think they got that perfect timing
To be doper than Saddam, believe the Nation of Islam
Fuck the police and the dogs, sniffing that dope up out your car
I think they overstep they boundaries
Huh, OJ, not guilty, that's how they found he

[Interlude: Cee-Lo]
Mmm, yeah, mmm, mmm
Mmm, yeah, mmm, mmm
Mmm, yeah, mmm, mmm
Mmm, yeah, mmm, mmm

[Verse 2: André 3000]
I felt the pressure like sun shining, while raining
At the same time, I kept on rhyming, not complaining
Storm braining cats and dogs, my catalog be the size of golf balls
Throw up your Daisy Dukes I'm Hazzard-ous to all you Boss Hoggs
And Rosco P. Col' people, who caboose my locomotive
But enough of that, everyone can rap but let's say gift, suppose if
I use my gift of gab to boast and brag in every rhyme I
Compose, won't y'all get sick of that, 'cause I know I do when I hear those
Flows that ain't hip-hop, you find that shit in the gift shop
But to each his own, my speech is born
Keep that shit up outta my zone
Long as you happy, then I'm happy
Even if you just hate my fucking guts, go 'head and dap me
'Cause I'm gon' dap you anyway
And then go home and pray for your ass later
'Cause we might need you in this war, I'm wailing on you traitors
Like that

[Intro]
Greetings, earthlings

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
From the bottom of my lungs a nigga be blowing
Spitting his game
Coming up on ya from the South, the A-T-Liens ain't changed
Cooler than most players claim to be
A nigga that's from the A-Town see
The home of the Bankhead Bounce
Campbellton Road and other city streets
Enough of the verality, fallacy, butter we speak not fiction
Speaking of pulling yo girl looking at Jheri curls you bitches
Everytime I rhyme for y'all, I'm looking to prove a point
Kicking a freestyle every now and then
But mostly off the joint
See I smoke good cause see it go good wit them flows, bwoi
The nigga the B-I-G like Tony Rich nobody knows why
But me and my folks, cause y'all niggas jokes like the Joker
I'm sick of these wack ass rappers like I'm tired of hoes in chokers

[Hook: André 3000 & Peaches]
Who them boys that be having it crunk every occasion
This side niggas dusting, that side niggas lacing
But in the middle we stay calm, we just drop bombs
Asking where we come from? South Coast slums
It's just two dope boys in a cadillac
It's just two dope boys in a cadillac

[Verse 2: André 3000]
This ol' sucka MC stepped up to me
Challenged André to a battle and I stood there patiently
As he spit and stumbled over cliches, so called freestyling
Whole purpose just to make me feel low, I guess you wilding
I say, "Look, boy, I ain't for that fuck shit—so fuck this"
"Let me explain 'only child' style so you don't dis'"
I grew up to myself not round no park bench
Just a nigga busting flows off in apartments

[Hook: André 3000 & Peaches]
Now who them boys that be having it crunk every occasion
This side niggas dusting, that side niggas lacing
But in the middle we stay calm, we just drop bombs
Asking where we come from? South  Coast slums
It's just two dope boys in a cadillac
It's just two dope boys in a cadillac

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
It goes Broughams to the Fleetwoods, Coupes to De Villes
Hitting Girbauds and off these flows we having the playa chill
In this atmosphere this ain't no practice here
We cutting the fool now
I'm doing ya at the house and throwing you out because I'm through now
Don't you love the way we claiming Bankhead, stankhead
Looking around the SWATS for the herb that's never tainted
Fainted when you heard the burban serving on the block
And all you biting individuals need to check yourselfs and stop

[Verse 4: André 3000]
Yeah, tight like nuts and bolts, sluts and hoes they get evicted
I'm dealing wit Queens in my castle—ain't worth it to risk it
Now tricks be looking at me like I'm they way up out the projects
Can't put you on my payroll, and no I ain't got no Rolex
Or no diamond; at the exit with a sign saying "We'll rap for food"
My face is bawled up cause I ain't in a happy mood
While my partner got the squeegee and the Windex
'Cause somewhere in my life I done went wrong just like a syntax error
Bring the terror to your dome like PE
Prone to finish this out cause this be a freestyle

[Hook: André 3000]
Now who them boys that be having the crunk every occasion?
This side niggas dustin', that side niggas lacin'
But in the middle we stay calm
We just drop–
(Explosion)

[Intro: Big Boi]
Ugh
As I sit in my b-boy stance
With flip-flops and socks, and sweatpants
I'm finna enhance your brains, check it out

[Verse 1: Big Boi + André 3000]
Once upon a time not long ago
When the playa from the Point didn't have no flow
A nigga hit me for my tennis shoes, walking to the store
Caught a player slipping
But now I lay it to the floor just like carpet
'Cause I got the heat in my baby momma name now
Never bragging just to stay knot
Even when I was a younger lad, I learned my lesson
Never talk to strangers in the trap and answer questions
The Pope and his folks got us under a scope
But for unknown reasons 'cause we don't sell dope
That you distribute
We don't contribute to your clandestine activity
My soliloquy may be hard for some to swallow
But so is cod liver oil
You went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl
Two things I hate—liars and thieves; they make my blood boil
Boa constricted, on my soul that they coil

[Hook: André 3000]
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel

[Verse 2: Big Boi + André 3000]
It took your momma nine months to make it
But it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it
Cut that kronk clean up, I did, but I did so not safely
Don't want no AIDS, *clapping* no claps, or no rabies
Yeah, we take no shit, like, ummm, stopped up commodes
Gotta collect call, they done locked up my folks
Low blow, hit me in the left ventricle
We won't be able to ride out till two thousand four
But not for long 'cause we got a better sack to serve
Tryna take you other people 'fore your rims at the curb
'Fore you swerve and bust ya forehead, go 'head, go 'head
More head for me, while you ride to the beat
Drop, like tears, like For Fears, you know
Shout, shout, let it all out, just for my peers
And peoples who feel it's time to unwind
Like December 31st, on nineteen-ninety-nine

[Hook: André 3000]
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel

[Bridge: André 3000]
Okay, like this, yes, yes
One time for my boys doing King shit
Two times, too legit and it don't quit
Three times for my folks in the drop top
Four times, OutKast and it don't stop
One time for my girls doing Queen thangs
Dead fresh to the T, eating chicken wings
Three times for my girls in the beauty shop
Four times, OutKast and it don't stop

[Instrumental Break]

[Hook: André 3000]
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel
Touched by the wheelz of steel...

[Hook: André 3000]
Do-doo-do-do Do-doo-do-do

People don't you worry bout me
Evil gon get buried by me
Well, I'm gonna shoot you out of this lil town and
Soon as I do it I'mma get down
Come on
Ah, ah, ah come on

[Hook: André 3000]
Do-doo-do-do Do-doo-do-do
Do-doo-do-do Do-doo-do-do

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Mama don't you worry bout me
Papa don't you worry bout me
Well, I live a life but it just ain't mine
I know I'm your son won't you let me shine
Come on
Ah, ah, ah come on

[Hook: André 3000]
Do-doo-do-do Do-doo-do-do
Do-doo-do-do Do-doo-do-do

[Verse 3: André 3000]
Sally don't you worry bout me
Sally don't you worry bout me
Don't worry bout me I'll be fine
Well, that's what I tell 'em, baby, but I'm lying
Come on, all people come on

[Interlude 1: André 3000]
Y'all know bout the blues don't you?
Everybody get the blues
Even babies get the blues

[Bridge: André 3000]
Some call it baby blue
Some call it midnight blue
Some call it navy blue
Whatever hue is what we gonna do
We gon' play until you feel happy
Till there ain't no more blues

[Hook: André 3000]
Do-doo-do-do Do-doo-do-do
Do-doo-do-do Do-doo-do-do

[Outro]
Idlewild
Be there

[Intro]
Something's gotta give!
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin? Uhh
Herndon Homes, unh, Martel Homes, Carver Homes, Techwood
Martin Luther King, Bankhead

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Undercover, over the hills and through the woods I go
Like green lights, a Southern nigga that's comin' for your throat
But not no guillotine see, we be them Southern playas
Remember the football socks, aerobic Reeboks and Decaturs, now
You up to par and ready for your lesson
I got an ounce of dank and a couple of drinks so let's crank up a session
Like Tri-Cities High School, was pulling 'em in a broke down Rabbit
I spit a couple of words and laying em down was just a habit
Just like Smokey, choking off da pee-wee that we rolled up
Talking about the clique will get you nathaniel but swolled up
Hootie Hoo slapped you boys across the cheek with Isotoners
And went to tell yo momma and yo pop that you was a goner
Tell 'em Big Boi did it; I swear that nigga be rhyming
Every lyric that he spit be turning charcoals into Diamonds and Pearls
Girl, when you giving up them drawers, 'cause
I got a couple of niggas down the hall
That wanna hit it too, I'm not the type to be acting selfish
Set it out and let it out and I'll be right back just like Elvis
'Cause the postman rings twice...
Hey Mr. Postman...

[Hook: Witchdoctor]
Power, power, I come, gimme some
The deadly voice over drums, we from, ATL
Put tha SWATS SWATS on yo' car
Let's travel far, tha Southern star shines
Power, power, I come, gimme some
The deadly voice over drums, we from, ATL
Put tha SWATS SWATS on yo' car
Let's travel far, tha Southern star shines

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Everybody wanna get signed, but (I'm here to tell you)
Record companies act like pimps
Getting paid off what we made when we the ones that's fly like blimps
But ain't no Goodyear, I tell it like it is so I'm like look here
Just willing to get what I deserve, my kids do have a mother
And a little house, with a dog in the backyard going "woof-woof"
Who knows what I must face when I leave this recording booth?
Poof, back in the real world where birds fly
From Miami by way of Cuba to whoever wants to get that high
There's clouds of clowns, seas of G's
Pro-jects, packed with playas meditating on their knees
Just to make them ends meet, like ground beef, you won't believe
The shit that niggas attempt 'cause they got other mouths to feed
Besides they own

[Hook: Witchdoctor]
Power, power, I come, gimme some
The deadly voice over drums, we from, ATL
Put tha SWATS SWATS on yo' car
Let's travel far, tha Southern star shines
Power, power, I come, gimme some
The deadly voice over drums, we from, ATL
Put tha SWATS SWATS on yo' car
Let's travel far, tha Southern star shines

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
It's some hoes in this house, damn right
I'm thinking about the way you skull me, girls be
Sucking me dry like deserts Mojave, Gotti, hotties and honeydips
Liking the way you do me, screw me and make my money flip
Shaking that ass for daddy, putting this gas off in my Cadi-llac
Back, don't ever snap, packing the gats and pimping whores
Hors d'oeuvres, swerve, hit the curb because I'm reckless
Back in the days when I was broke I'd snatch your fucking necklace
You ol' pussy-ass nigga... yeah

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Peep what I say
Everyday the sun sets just like clockwork
To put the Glock to work
And putting the body to standstills
Man it kills me
Taking that life is like taking a shit
Hit or miss, niggas are playing God
Trying to rob and steal
That's why ya gotta guard ya grill
Like a barbecue cause them harming you
Are just like honeybees swarming you
Vocally arming you was my responsibility
It's killing me thinking that all these niggas see they flauging
Thinking they Steven Seagal and balling
Falling to the wayside when ya try to call, I've fallen
When we was little nappy headed niggas in the projects
But now they carjacks, wait on income tax and unsafe sex
Still yet they tend to flex, like solo for tha lo-lo
Smoke same thing, no-no, not this time
Niggas around my way can rhyme
So fuck that country shit, we done a bunch of shit
And yes ya heard of this out of this world like E.T
Coming across ya T.V
Extraterrestrial - straight from ATL

[Hook]
Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Right now I'm smiling, taking advantage of this moment
Cause there might not be another soon
Holding on to memories like roller coaster handle bars
Tightly cause I'm slightly off my rocker
But to you I may appear to be your average Joe
But little do you know that even Joe got problems that he gots to joust with
Floating in this game of life despite how out of place you may feel
In this race oh you just can't quit
Ain't that a bitch that be in heat
I'm on the beat like cops
Only cultivate the stable dirt when I skeet my drops
No concentrating knocking other niggas out the box
Why? Cause in a sense see we all be kind of fly
Just can't be scared to spread your wings, head to better things
Maybe the mockingbird and nightingale they want to sing
Keeping this thing alive, to the table's what we bring
We like hailstorms and blizzards in the middle of the spring
Extraterrestrial, out of this world

[Hook]
Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world

[André 3000]
My suit is dark my clouds are gray
And all things around me pass away
Well what if I leave
Yeah thats what I'll do I'll leave

Cause 88 keys is all I got to lose
That ain't much, you can have them shoes

I'm dyin to love dyin to play
Dyin to get out of here
I'm dyin to live

(female singers)
Percival (ohhh)
Says goodye (ohhh)
An angel dies

[Intro: André 3000]
Chronomentrophobia
The fear of clocks
The fear of time
Yeah

[Verse 1: André 3000]
High as the cost of living
Ohh
I take what I've been given
Pastor say, "Be strong"
Ooh, yeah, hey
I ain't got time, leave me alone
Ain't that much time left, I've got to funk you now

[Hook: André 3000]
Chronomentrophobia, chronomentrophobia
Chronomentrophobia, chronomentrophobia
Chronomentrophobia, chronomentrophobia
Chronomentrophobia, chronomentrophobia

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Lord be having mercy on my soul
I'm having the impression that my life gon' be a bowl
Of cherries, but it's very hard for me to cope
Got tired of being broke
This ATLien ain't got no time to sit and mope
Made up my mind while y'all made up y'all beds
On a cold wooden floor is where I laid my head
Born in 1975, never thought I'd make it this far
Still battling in this racial war
Tryna find solutions to the situation I'm facing
Only thing that's free is my flow that y'all be chasing
Letting my niggas know before I go, I drop that knowledge
Like dropping books; let's stop the crooks
From robbing you of your brains and such
Using welfare as a crutch
I'm in it for good; you enter my hood, you won't be finding much
Hope that when I'm gone, y'all remember this
What we stood for: "Fuck that fame and that glitz"
It's beginning to look a lot like the ending
And got to be more careful, know what corners you be bending
Revelations, getting impatient, and now, I'm dead
Remember what I said; I'm gone, bow your heads

[Intro]
"Can I dance?" {*echoes*}

[Unfamiliar voice]
Awww shit {*echoes*}
{*whispered*} Big Boi! Big Boi!

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
What if everything you ever knew or known was lost?
The knees'll tend to freeze you when you gatherin yo' thoughts
You pause for the cause, try to recall and remember
But the train is in reverse and the caboose is in the center
Cause ya mind ain't free
Constricted by the muthafuckin boundaries, an ounce of weed
Or a pound of 'dro couldn't place you on the planet where I'm transmitting
Life from Bro, Bra, bruh, Brother, Bro-ham
Cadillac on vogues, strike a pose, then the door slam
Wham nigga, wham! Don't they say that in their show, dad?
Fo' sho' man, you acting like a tadpole out of gonads
You know OutKast the truth, hit the booth, be makin' more jams
Spreading strawberry preserves on ya nervous program
(Fuck the learning curve) We took our ramp to No Man's Land
Hello? Is anybody home? Is anybody giving dome?
Serve me up, I want some

[Hook]
Buggface, toe jam
(Frown ya face up, cause we don't give a jam)
Jam to the jam, go jelly to the jam
(Imagine me not jamming, shove it up ya monkey jam)

Buggface, toe jam
(Frown ya face up, cause we don't give a jam)
Jam to the jam, go jelly to the jam
(Imagine me not jamming, shove it up ya monkey jam)

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
When I'm left alone, I get to thinkin to myself
The mind is a terrible thing to waste, so use it 'til none left
Like everything is alright, clearly tight to def
I can see clearly now, analyzing every step (step)
Clearly you can feel me cause it's beating through yo' chest (chest)
And you can see me clearly through the window, paint drip but wet
With no tint, not deject.. clearly I'm a vet
And not no veterinarian but clearly pit bulls are the best (are the best, are the best)
Like the O.U.T.K.A.S. clearly nigga you know the rest
And if you actin like ya don't, then clearly nigga you tryna test
Crystal clearly I confess and I suggest you clear the runway
Cause the ticket is a one-way, (clearly) back we won't be coming
Bugg!

[Hook]
Buggface, toe jam
(Frown ya face up, cause we don't give a jam)
Jam to the jam, go jelly to the jam
(Imagine me not jamming, shove it up ya monkey jam)

Buggface, toe jam
(Frown ya face up, cause we don't give a jam)
Jam to the jam, go jelly to the jam
(Imagine me not jamming, shove it up ya monkey jam)

[Outro]
"Can I dance?" {*echoes*}
Oh shit, Bamboo! You gonna break.. get outta here, you 'bout to break somethin!
(Stop!) Y'all just playing around now.. y'all just playing around
Come on Cross! (what?) You can hear the music from there

[Verse 1: Big Boi + Sleepy Brown]
Whether you like it or not, he's back
D-A-double-D-Y Fatt Saxx
(Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some beat it up
The game done changed
OutKast came to heat it up)
Sharp as a tack like I just left church (Clean)
Bark then attack when the shit won't work (Mean)
(Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some beat it up
The game done changed
OutKast came to heat it up)
And everybody wanna know whats really goin' on
Is you and 3000 still makin' songs?
So on and so on
I can go o-on and o-on
And on, and on, and on
Hell yes!

[Chorus: Scar]
Music makes the world go 'round
Where it goes (Where it goes)
Ya' just don't know (Ya' just don't know)
My heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' 'Hey, baby'
Sayin' 'Hey, baby'
So baby, please believe me
Don't you go (Don't you go)
Baby, no, no, no (Baby, no, no, no)
My heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' 'Hey, baby'
Sayin' 'Hey, baby'

[Verse 2: Big Boi + Sleepy Brown]
Two dope boyz in the Cadillac, still
'Kast wear the crown on ya Cadillac Seville
I'll make your wheels of steel stand (still)
Like your DJ got killed
The fire marsh-
Fire marshall (Shut her down; time to go!)
OutKast royalty by design of logo
Wanna count it out loud?
93, 94, 95, 96
Plus a dime, still that fire
Hot like the perm on the back of your neck
Left it in too long, now ya got Cabbage Patch silky
(Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some beat it up
The game done changed
OutKast came to heat it up)
Bendin' corners like a crowbar, oh so unique
Got the pedal to the floor, but the 4-door just creeps
(Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some beat it up
The game done changed
OutKast came to heat it up)
Exotic, melodic melodies, yep, we got it
Funkin' for the funk of it and everybody want it
(Roof!) You make a nigga put a dog on it
(Roof!) You make a nigga put a dog on it

[Chorus: Scar]
Music makes the world go 'round
Where it goes (Where it goes)
Ya' just don't know (Ya' just don't know)
My heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' 'Hey, baby'
Sayin' 'Hey, baby'
So baby, please believe me
Don't you go (Don't you go)
Baby, no, no, no (Baby, no, no, no)
My heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' 'Hey, baby'
Sayin' 'Hey, baby'

[Verse 3: Scar]
I'm tippin' my hat off to ya baby
'Cause you're so fine, blow my mind
I put in the time
Everybody knows you can't let a pretty one pass you by
Without sayin' 'Hi'
I'm so gone over you
And yes, it's true
Baby, do what you do
My nose is open so wide (So wide, yeah)
Lookin' at you such a pretty sight (So wide, yeah)
My heart is on my sleeve (My sleeve, yeah)
And this is how it sounds to me (This is how it sounds)

[Chorus: Scar]
Music makes the world go 'round
Where it goes (Where it goes)
Ya' just don't know (Ya' just don't know)
My heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' 'Hey, baby'
Sayin' 'Hey, baby'
So baby, please believe me
Don't you go (Don't you go)
Baby, no, no, no (Baby, no, no, no)
My heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' 'Hey, baby'
Sayin' 'Hey, baby'

[Outro: Scar]
Baby, you and me
We make a musical masterpiece
I travel the land
Me and the band
We bringin' the church back to their feet
So wait, baby
Don't leave me, baby
Say wait, baby
Don't leave me, baby

Baby, you and me
We make a musical masterpiece
I travel the land
Me and the band
We bringin' the church back to their feet
So wait, baby
Don't leave me, baby
Say wait, baby
Don't leave me, baby

[Verse 1]
N-n-n-not too far but long ago
When life was straight up and cars would move slow
When you were cool if you were pigeon-toed
But things have changed (it ain't so simple)
Now life is a musical

I called Big Boi on the telephone
I said "hey hold up 'fore we put out another song"
Say no matter what goes down we stand strong
Cause ain't nothin changed (it's simple)
Hey let's make a musical

Based on fict and faction
Or verse, vica throw in some action
And you got us well to a fraction
Cause things have changed (it's all hood)
The Kast go Hollywood

[Chorus]
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Change us change us
Change us change us
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Change us change us
Change us change us
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Change us change us
Change us change us
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Don't let 'em don't let 'em
Don't (echoes)

[Intro: Big Boi]
Yeah!
I know y'all already know what it is
Damn!
Too much inspiration
Here we go

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Back when I was a freshman, I learned a valuable lesson
A ho gon be a ho and it don't matter about you stressin'
The only thing you do is tap that throat and wear protection
And only when she spit it out is when you feel rejection
Evidence and DNA drop down, stainin her dress
She's making a great big mess, can I get something off your chest?
And that is no intended pun, I'm just joshin' with you hun
Don't we always have a blast as we bust one on one
One on one (uhh) one on one

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
I, I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Now that I'm a graduate, she still gotta have it
School days are over, spike the punch, and you can stab it
Joog joog, more joog, kush, pull, more wood
Ice and tone her glove, bedding nicely cause we go good together
Like Salt-N-Pepa, Kool Aid and sugar, mustard and mayonnaise
Shoulda, coulda, and woulda, uhhh
And that is no intended pun, I'm just joshin' with you hun
Don't we always have a blast as we bust one on one
One on one

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
I, I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you

[Khujo Goodie & Big Boi]
Ain't talking about commitment
Shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop
Ain't talking about no wedding ring
Shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop
I hope you ain't a gold-diggin biatch
Shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop
But you a fine lil' sexy thang
Shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop (uhh)

[OutKast & Khujo Goodie]
I, I don't want no girlfiend
I just wanna get into (just wanna get into you)
I, I don't want no girlfiend
I just wanna get into (just wanna get into you)

[Hook]
I, I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I, I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you

[Big Boi]
Girl, bye, i.e
Get the hell on, I'm through, make me a sandwich
I love you
Only at this moment, maybe not tomorrow
Kisses, toodles
Ah, lil' me
Man y'all play too much
Now now Percival, don't fret
We're here to help you *laughs*
I told you to bring good songs... what are you gonna do now?
Look at the keys... well... you gotta do something
Keep your eyes on the keys... here's looking at you kid *laughs*
Okay okay... well... make up somethin... yeah right
You won't make sense... I don't know lets try it
Here we go *clears throat*

[Hook]
Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense at all

[Verse 1]
ABC, 123, Do-re-mi, out of key
(you got that right)
Out of touch, out of tune, butterknife, tea spoon
(now what was that)
Razz-a-matazz, Thing-a-majig, whatchamacallit, bullshit
So and so, such and such (bullshit!) pretty much
(I think I'm gonna throw up)

[Hook]
Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense at all (blah blah blah blah)
Makes no sense at all (blah blah blah blah)
Makes no sense at all (blah blah)

[Verse 2]
1 and 1 makes 2, 2 and 2 makes 4, 4 and 4 makes 8 and 8 makes 16
16 and, 16 makes (32 Percival)
Ahh makes no sense at all
Who needs lyrics anyway (ummm... YOU!)

[Bridge]
How in the hell do we get ourselves in these situations?
How in the hell do we get ourselves in these situations?
How in the hell do we get ourselves in these situations?
How in the hell do we get ourselves in these situations?
How in the hell do we get ourselves in these situations?
How in the hell do we get ourselves in these situations?
How in the hell do we get ourselves in these situations?
How in the hell do we get ourselves in these situations?

(during bridge) (bridge continues throughout)
Hey! Hey little buddy where you going?
Come back man! We was just playin! Come on man!
See I pissed him off
{*bridge fades out to piano solo*}

[Intro: Trumpet, Percy Jr.]
Hey Percy Jr., Percy Jr... wha-wha-what's that
What's that you playin?
Workin on somethin new
Sound like some bullshit
I mean you really think the audience is gonna appreciate that?
Well, Rooster say I can play what I wanna
No, never mind anything that Rooster tell ya
You gonna play the stuff I like, okay?

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Ain't nobody like my style, yeah
I light my fire, yeah
(I light my fire, I light my fire!)
They blow it out, yeah
(They blew it out, they blew it out!)
And don't nobody gonna feel like that, no
Monkeys on my back crawl
Now watch them all fall
Gon' fall! Look out!

[Hook One: André 3000]
Nobody wanted to dance
When I had a lot of time on my hands
Now I gotta lot of hands on my time
And everybody wanna be a friend of mine
Whoa, whoa! I wouldn't mind a friend
The fellas back home all tryna win
Moon keeps shining on bootleg bottles
Cops in the street, keep yo' feet on the throttle
Sellin' what you got, can't afford they model
Yellin, "Go PJ, go!"

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Ain't no Idle; everything is Wild, yeah
You can be here now, yeah
(Soon as you turn around)
Be in the ground, yeah
(Four, five, six feet underground)
And ain't no bible at this here church, no
You won't find God, no
Might meet Him first, oh
Oh, God! Look out!

[Hook Two: André 3000]
Nobody wanted to leave
House so packed that we couldn't even breathe
And ain't no better place to fall in love
Angels sent from heaven above
Swing down! They gon' change ya life
You might make a baby, might meet ya wife
But one sure thing that you gonna say
Deep down south rustling in yo' place
Them Idlewild cats man they don't play
Don't make me send the telegram to Rooster, he'll shoot ya

[Break: Taffy]
You better come harder than that sweetie!
This ain't no mortuary!

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
And you don't wanna take it to the gat so soon
Stinkin to ya Jenkins, waiting in the upper room
Tell ya maker, say ya prayers, we some playas but you made us
Mashed potatoes, bad potato, blast you hater, blast the gator
So you might just wanna kick back and drink roots
Take hat to ya woman, relax, break loose
Cause pret' soon if she choose, she gon' walk away from you
Straight to the Rooster cause he's cock-a-doodle poo
What they do fool?
Who's tryna run a small time crap shooting
All time fat chewing, hats got the matching suit and lens
All cats pursuing, kinda wild, it's Idlewild
Time to break it on, break it on down now
Percival take it on out!

[Refrain: André 3000]
Say whoa Mammy!... whoa Mammy!
Say whoa Pappy!... whoa Pappy!
Say whoa Mammy!... whoa Mammy!
Say whoa Pappy!... whoaaa!
Everybody get up! Aww, naw, naw, naw, get down!
Everybody get up! Aww, naw, naw, naw, get down!
Everybody get up! Aww, naw, naw, naw, get down!
Everybody get up! Aww, naw, naw, naw, get down!
Everybody get up! Aww, naw, naw, naw, get down!
Everybody get up! Aww, naw, naw, naw, get down!
Everybody get up! Aww, naw, naw, naw, get down!
Everybody get up! Aww, naw, naw, naw, get down!

[Horn sounds play 'til fade]

[Intro]
Hey
Uh-huh
Well, all right
How y'all doing?
Yes, ma'am
Looking mighty fine

[Verse 1]
I've been around the world
Seen so many pretty girls
But I still get overwhelmed
When I look in your eyes

[Verse 2]
Been from Maine to Spain
But everything seems the same
I only feel the change
When I look in your eyes

[Bridge 1]
I know you're upper-class
I know you've got pizzazz
Every man wanna kiss yo'...
And I do too

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I'm just a clown
And everybody puts me down
I guess I'll come around
When I look in your eyes

[Verse 4]
Tell me what's a man to do
To get close to you
I'm just a lonely fool
When I look in your eyes

[Bridge 2]
Don't tell me no this time
If you do, it'll blow my mind
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
It's an awful thing

[Verse 5]
I guess it's time to say goodbye
But I gotta give it one more try
I'm only satisfied
When I look in your eyes

[Bridge 3]
Ooh, please come home with me
Ooh, don't you wanna marry me?
I'm even gonna rub your feet
When they stink
(How can...)

[Verse 6]
How can I let you down?
I guess I'm always gonna be around
I'm simply astounded
When I look in your eyes
{"It all started at an accident scene on Bankhead and Ashby
It's not clear if the suspect caused it; it is clear he wielded
A hammer and told ..... to get out of his car."}

[Verse 1]

[Big Boi]
Yeah, now check it
From alligator belts to patty melts, I be that smoothest nigga
So how do you figure that Atlanta don't be pullin dem triggas?
The Southernplayalistic pimp is up in this bitch
Man, my folkers up on that track, complimentin' that wickedness
See one is for the money, two is for my niggas who jack
Niggas ain't takin' that shit no mo', they got big Benz and Cadillac
My gat is in my lap, so whatchu wanna be startin' now?
I'm pissin' up on Jeffrey's Dahmer grave, that cracker was foul

[André 3000]
Too close for comfort, too close to home
Too close to be playin' your boy, so hey, why don't you get your own?
As long, as I got this legally
People see that we can be on top of things without causin' another nigga sorrow
I know it seems it ain't enough to go around
But keep on holdin' on like Goodie Mob 'cause it's a better day tomorrow
That's all I can say, can't tell the future
Tomorrow's another day but today, they just might shoot you
For your ride, fuck your pride, hide better be out your seat
Quick and snappy with a happy face before you bleed
Ask me, if that material shit is worth your life
I don't know about yours, but if so, you smoking pipes, right?

[Hook 4X]
Either want a Benz or a Beamer

[Verse 2]

[André 3000]
Deep in the Dungeon for these many months
Amongst the Dungeon Dragon as we pass around dem blunts
Had to cut it out like shears, but for years I used to burn 'em
Gettin deep off in my thoughts just to get shit off my sternum
Chest/chess, I never played but made many a moves
I still blame it on the session 'cause I can't remember the due
I guess, I feel that getting a Benz is out of the question
The world is yelling Hootie Hoo but in my pockets nuthin but
Gum and lint, to sum the shit, up, I'm broke
Nothin' but hope, so Big Boi, tell 'em what you toke

[Big Boi]
I'm travellin' up to Jersey with four keys off in my trunk
And thinkin' of startin' the ways to get that motherfucker crunk
See yes I be that nigga that with that sess off in my chest
Smokin' and chokin' them token blacks, that wanted to test
See strong niggas survive and the weak niggas they die
I never fuck no white bitch, I stopped eatin' at pig stys
Be activatin that Lo-Jack 'cause the Fleetwood has been stolen
Campbellton Road is open, the B-I-G has spoken
'Cause it's like this

[Hook 4X]
Either want a Benz or a Beamer

[Verse 3]

[Big Boi]
I got these thoughts, similar to the ones in Call of the Wild
Up in the Benz is where I be doin' about a hundred miles
The world is FUCKED UP how these niggas be driving drunk
Vehicular homicide with their bodies off in your trunk
To me the car does not belong, I use that strong arm robbery
Robbin' spree, look at me, W-M-B backwards
Takin' you to the chop shop with these verses
Comin' around the projects make you sleep off in dem hearses
I got a word of wisdom, for those who must resist
You'll be needin' a physical therapist, 'cause you can't fuck with this

[André 3000]
While you sat down by the seashore thinkin' about some seashells
I was around the corner from Pleasant Hill thinkin' about the V-12
But maybe not for long because I just done seen the light
I'm packing my screwdriver so see I'm gon' be alright
Just moving the steering wheel side to side like a slalom
Now I ain't got no problem, I'm just breaking the steering column
I spot him, in the middle of the MARTA parking lot
I'm hearin' a voice in the back of my head yellin "Andre stop!"
But do I stop, naw, I figure it's a come up
But now I'm goin' down 'cause the folks wanna run up
BANG!!!

[Hook 4X]
Either want a Benz or a Beamer

(*scratched* Mmm...drop)

{"These days, the best way to deal with a carjacker
Is to simply give them what they want."}

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
Just keep your faith in me
Don't act impatiently
You'll get where you need to be
In due time
Even when things are slow
Hold on and don't let go
I'll give you what I owe
In due time

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
When that nigga be thinkin' of cruisin, the Braves cap is to the side
Thinkin' the police gon' pull me over with this herb off in my ride
So I hide the brick of weed, under the arm rest, under the leather
And thinkin' of startin' ways to make my life a little bit better
Than the dope peddler
Never to pay no fucking taxes
Takin' a chunk up out of my checks and makin' my rhymes just look like practice
Buying clothing, Range Roving with my folks
Don't speak about the Dirty South, my crew ain't bout no jokes
I know some people don't like the way we flow because they envy
They talkin' about they fucked my hoes and that they could have been me
You lookin' to be the butterfly, without the caterpillar
Take your time and do it right cause you gon' make it, I swear my nigga
Or collapse one, fallin' a victim to your greed, boi
You're lookin' to be Big Willie, but you're still a seed, boi
The information in my skull be pokin' some of y'all on the shoulder
But on the other side of the fence, they got y'all niggas breakin' boulders
For quick money

[Verse 2: Cee-Lo Green]
Strugglin's just a part of my day
Many obstacles have been placed in my way
I know the only reason that I make it through
Is because I never stop believing in you
Some people wonder why we here in the first place
They can't believe 'cause they ain't never seen your face
But even when you pray, the next day you gotta try
Can't wait for nobody to come down out the sky
You've got to realize that the world's a test
You can only do your best and let Him do the rest
You've got your life, and got your health
So quit procrastinating and push it yourself
You've got to realize that the world's a test
You can only do your best and let Him do the rest
You've got your life, and got your health
So quit procrastinating...

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
Just keep your faith in me
Don't act impatiently
You'll get where you need to be
In due time
Even when things are slow
Hold on and don't let go
I'll give you what I owe
In due time

[Verse 3: André 3000]
Uh, who said good folks is not supposed to die?
The same nigga that said niggas is not supposed to cry
United States giving out milk and cheese to pacify
I'm sure they got a cure for AIDS but yet it's classified
You wonder why I spit the truth and not to make no dough
To make a difference 'fore this motherfucker up and blow
In pieces
I could think of many reasons
Only when shit is going bad, you want to holla Jesus
Fuck a pledge allegiance, they got my knuckles bleedin'
From crawling
Got these niggas thinkin' they really ballin'
When they isn't
Don't take my word, there's niggas off in prison
That will tell you
That's locked up for long time and won't sell you no flex
So congregation, will you turn your text
To the book of OutKast, chapter two, verse one
The first one that feel me, jump up and make a joyful noise
You's OutKast-ed, meaning, now you have a choice, like that

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green]
Just keep your faith in me
Don't act impatiently
You'll get where you need to be
In due time
Even when things are slow
Hold on and don't let go
I'll give you what I owe
In due time
Just keep your faith in me
Don't act impatiently
You'll get where you need to be
In due time
Even when things are slow
Hold on and don't let go
I'll give you what I owe
In due time

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Now sittin' in the bathtub listening to the Isley
Brothers and others outside my door want to despise me
Reminds me that everyone ain't cool, the world is jealous
Never could understand when my mama use to tell us
"Don't take your food outside around your friends
Unless you got enough to feed the neighborhood"
The play has just began, follow me now
Act 1 Scene 2 the date 1/1/96 the time I don't know
Mood disturbed, Dre goes on to say they trying to get over
Like them niggas with the blinker on, I got my thinker on
So I'm like 'Word, however you want to act is fine'
That is real as fishing rods
I might be kissing God but I'm still in the battle
So if you got cattle you best be fasting
For 7 days and 7 nights we everlasting
20 years young on a quest to get my class ring
Just for them fhite wolks, I will if it's the last thing
I do

Yeah, slick, knowhatI'msayin', I'm gonna tell you like this
Just 'cause I live the apartment don't mean you can keep puttin' these notes under my windshield, I'm tellin' you
Shorty gon' bust your ass about that shit

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Check it, hey y'all, hey y'all, hey y'all, hoes
Back up in this bitch rippin' tracks like I'm supposed
Tommy and Ralph Lauren don't like niggas to wear they clothes
Where your proof at? Who's that? Talking shit like those
Keepin' the rumors up, I wish I lived in a fuckin' cave
I ride the streets in Lexus, all these crows they wanna be saved
Go to college, get a job 'cause all you want to do is shake
I use to hit Club Nikki's but I gave that shit a break
Just like Maaco, Waco, burn it to the ground
I bet you eatin' that pork when your partners ain't around
Backdraft, scenes of Shaft splackin' these hoes just like he's supposed to
Quote you: "Big Boi is the pimp ass nigga that formed you"
Like pottery, sloppily, playin' hoes like lotteries
OutKast did the dirt and now you swear your shit is poppin' see
You bit (beats), we makin' hits, so give me your flag back
I'm living in the SWATS so you may call me Daddy Fat Sax
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'? Like this

[Big Boi]
One in a million men passing the J off in the culture
Don't y'all smoke a couple of pounds and get tore up y'all
And tear the devil headquarters down to the grizzound
Is how we hit the house and puff a couple of good pounds
Of good weed, PeeWee, my nigga Little Beewee
We need a 50 box of Phillies and some bouncin' titties
From the Magic, the Flame
Nikki's too, and share in Sequel's
Never payin' for no pussy
You can shake it, you can keep it to yourself, hoe

[André 3000]
You left your morals at the door, when you stepped in, crept in
Naked as babies at the beach, so
Now you wonder why your nigga done bust you in the fore
Head, ain't no respect there, so now you just assed out like breech
Delivery, slivery got you swung on
These types of things go on from here to Bowen Home to London
England, Wall Street to y'all street
Sometimes I get bewildered and it throws a nigga like me off beat
But I'm back on it
Because we lasting 'ever, sound good, don't it?
Rattling your trunks like FAMU and the component
Said that's it—man, fuck that shit
On and on and on and I'm out

[Hook: André 3000 & Sleepy Brown]
In the land of a million drums
There is always something going on, on, on, on
If you can't locate your thought off
Might as well go on take your dead home, home, home, home

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
In the land of a million drums
I catch a pattern that spit rings around you like Saturn
Intergalatic tracks I make 'em like magstrulium
This one for scooby, pass the doobie I'mma do me one, do me one
Only you clean over
I pick up the mic and rock it while I'm sober
For the rated G exposure if you listen what I'm tryin to told ya
We fathers with seeds of our own
We're talkin about sons and daughters boy, not roots and clones
Now that the theory gone wrong
An embryo with no soul
Stuck in this green mini-van with my lungs in a chokehold
Shaggy pass the boombastic
Daphne said don't do that
Freaky Fred smashed the gas and slammed us into traffic
Now Scrappy wanna box and throw them bows
So I had to sic the pitbull on him before he could pass one blow
Scooby-doo, scooby-doo, scooby damn doo, scooby doo (Scooby doobie doo)

[Hook: André 3000 & Sleepy Brown]
In the land of a million drums
There is always something going on, on, on, on
If you can't locate your thought off
Might as well go on take your dead home, home, home, home

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Woke up from a long night of hanging out with Shaggy
Oh no, lost my last baggy of scoobie snackies
Shaggy, wake up, we've been had
Our Scooby snacks, they got the whole stash
He said, "Who, who?"
I don't have a clue
I suspect the thirteen ghosts of Scoobie Doo
Call Vincent Price up on the Nextel
Tell him to send another package right through the mail
In the meantime, I'ma call Velma to tell her
To get the Mystery Machine ready
I'm two-wayin' Daphne and Freddy
Me and Shaggy dressed in all black, strapped
Dippin' through the flash trying to get our stash back
Rounding up suspects, collectin' clues
I got a question, where the hell is Scooby Doo when you need him?
The hound's only found when you feed him
In fact he probably got my sack
Tell him holler back

[Hook: André 3000 & Sleepy Brown]
In the land of a million drums
There is always something going on, on, on, on
If you can't locate your thought off
Might as well go on take your dead home, home, home, home

[Break: André 3000]
Break it down, break it down baby 'til the flow jumps off the ground
Ooo break it down lookin' over yonder til the walls come tumblin down
Ooo, yes lord y'ain't gotta tell me two times but you know I know
Ooo, break it down, break it down baby 'cuz I want y'all all to know
We rock the world

[Hook: André 3000 & Sleepy Brown]
In the land of a million drums
There is always something going on, on, on, on
If you can't locate your thought off
Might as well go on take your dead home, home, home, home

[Outro]
I coulda got away with it, if it wasn't for ya meddlin kids
(oh oh, oh no)

[Intro]
All aboard
Or, are all y'all bored?
It's good to have y'all back now
Ladies and gents
Y'all already know what it is
(God don't make no mistakes)
(God don't make no mistakes)

[Verse 1]
Little do they know when I was brought up in this game
'Twan ain't always in a vibe for spitting, I made a change
Like the diaper on the bottom of my baby daughter
I wasn't ready to be no father, maybe, kinda, sorta
'Cause when I saw her, I swear it made a tear fall
Not tears of sorrow but of joy, so listen here y'all
I grabbed the mic and moved the crowd then disappeared, dog
Back in '94, that was the motherfucking year, homeboy
Then that Southernplayalistic went platinum
Stacks on deck, they ain't tell us to pay our taxes
Walking around the table in the kitchen just for practice
Reciting rhymes to sharpen mine, now let's deliver to the masses

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
It's been a good long road
Now its time for me to go
I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Time to spread my wings
So high up in the sky
I can fly, I fly, I fly, so high

[Verse 2]
Welcome to my life, I think its time I take it back
I got to give you all the facts so you can see what type of cat
That you dealing with
Now on ATLiens, we was killing it
And then my auntie passed, she was like my mother, I was feeling it
The first person close to me to die, I needed healing
But I see her as an angel when I look up at the ceiling
Like my daddy and granddaddy on both shoulders steady chilling
So you got to keep on living like each day is the beginning
It's your birthday, even on your worst day
Live it like the first day, I'm Antwan Andre
Or General Patton if you know 'bout Purple Ribbon or Got Purp
I, I be on that kryptonite, that means I can't be hurt

(Gotta leave this place it's been cool but I got to go...)

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
It's been a good long road
Now its time for me to go
I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Time to spread my wings
So high up in the sky
I can fly, I fly, I fly, so high

[Bridge]
Even on the train
Surely as truth remains
I'll be back again
(Know we been through a lot, and I ain't perfect
But I swear to you I'm a changed man)
Even on the train
Surely as truth remains
I'll be back again
(From the caboose)

[Verse 3]
And now it's time to say goodbye, they should've turned me loose
I was all about my team but now I call upon my crew
I'm a family type of person but I'm deadly dolo too
You can achieve anything that you put your heart into
See the second hand will never stop and neither will the clock
The nigga Big still hit the stage by hisself and still rock
Cus when your faith is in the right place, see, he ain't gon' let you flop
You can say whatever you want (Bet you can't do it like me) Boy, stop!!

[Bridge]
Before you say you can't hit goal
Please, no excuse this time, don't be afraid to fly
You never know what day the doors will close
It's time to say goodbye time to pack up and ride
Got to leave this place it's been cool but I gotta go
(I can take it from here, ladies; y'all done a good deed tonight)

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
It's been a good long road
Now its time for me to go
I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Time to spread my wings
So high up in the sky
I can fly, I fly, I fly, so high

[Hook: Scar & Sleepy Brown]
Stages in life no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows where I've gone and been
Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend

[Verse 1: Big Boi (Sample)]
I cram to understand why a woman and a man
Make a plan to enter matrimony then he takes her hand
Put that ring on her finger, couple of kids in minivans
Standin' in the stands like a fan, watch her little man
Run ball... And every time you see the family they look happy
Got a mama and a daddy and I think they got a lil' dog
But daddy had a cat on the side
He would hide her from his ride decide not to divide
Kept the yam in the hide the spouse in the house
Boy its cheaper to keep her you fuck around and take a loss
Come up short like Short Dog cuss words flow like
(Motherfucker, shit, goddamn asshole)
Took my shit (Beitch!) FUCK!

[Hook: Scar & Sleepy Brown]
Stages in life no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows where I've gone and been
Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend

[Verse 2: Big Boi (Sample)]
It was the night that they done dipped
And all throughout the palace
Death didn't do us part, heart broke or no more marriage (Beitch!)
When it happens you'll be slappin' yourself rememberin'
You coulda remained boyfriend and girlfriend
Now you're sittin' in the courthouse, plaintiff and defendant (Bitch)
Pleadin' to the judge you was in it to win it
In the beginnin' was splendid see she was grinnin' and spendin'
All of her time wit the kids an' in the kitchen she'd cook
She was fierce on the stove it was always great
Covered plates in the microwave when I came home late
But now we just debate like some candidates damn I hate
Friction wishin' I had paperwork on the misses but I didn't
Damn... fuckin' around (Hey baby)

[Hook: Scar & Sleepy Brown]
Stages in life no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows where I've gone and been
Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend

[Bridge: Sleepy Brown & Scar (Big Boi)]
Girl you have to remember
I gotta provide for the family and future
So please stay down and please stay around cause you know
That I'm tryna change but its hard cause I've been this way
(Man you already knew that shit)

[Hook: Scar & Sleepy Brown]
Stages in life no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows where I've gone and been
Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend
Life
Ooooh, yeeeeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Dre 3000]
Yeah yeah uh
Been always told to keep my head up
But cliches just don't cut the cake when your neck tired from bobbing
Life's a stage, street's the cage
We dungeon rats Outkast and Goodie Mobbin
Enough of the petite talk, I'd rather have a nigga with a perm
Ain't got to have punk, on my side than a nigga who frontin
To another nigga's interpretation of god-stuntin
My growth, why vote for president if he a spot guy
That's like choosing which bullet you gon' get shot by
A drank and some hot fries
Slowly eating me up from inside to outside
Well you gon' die anyway, right? Wrong
I plan to live forever, I know it seems mighty long
If you think about it in Earth terms
Thank god we on the TV what we let like earthworms
Stay underground like Cheers or Dig Dug
Only come above to shake hands and give hugs
Lay your beautiful body down on this fur rug
You got to give a damn if you do not give a fuck, ha!
Rack 'em up 'cuz we bustin'
Once was the nigga in the back of the class who never said nothing
His thought became an amplifier
I live for inspiration, for without that, I will die (go!)
Jitterbug jam now can you dig it?
Don't stop and uh don't quit cuz uh
We own that high school shit and uh
You know that uh we spit it
Jitterbug jam now can you dig it?
Don't stop and uh don't quit cuz uh
We own that high school shit and uh
You know that uh we spit it
Jitterbug jam now can you dig it?

[Slim Cutta-Calhoun]
Got issues on my mind like a fool from Columbine
Will I swallow my pride or take that ride?
Better think before my cock get slide and take a dive
Into this hot pit like oil and grits
Stand alone on my own ten toes against foes
It's a snowstorm and you outside gettin' cold
Luck has struck one buck for seven every roll
Throwin' snake eyes thinkin' a nigga gon' fold
Stand down like four black vogues on golds
Snatchin' all the dough and leavin' y'all broke
Going all out for an A plus in class
I bust ass walkin' barefoot over broken glass
Now who gon' pass player? You won't last
See we all in the race just taking up space
If we's on the other side of the track grab the straps
Thought y'all knew wild dogs run in packs
So who you think you foolin? We can get to dueling
On some old school shit, like we high schoolin'

[Bell rings]

There he is!

Get him!

(Don't run! Don't run!)

Yeah, sucker! What'cha gon' do now? What'cha gon' do now sucker?

Don't stop and uh don't quit cuz uh
We own that high school shit and uh
You know that uh we spit it
Jitterbug jam now can you dig it?
Don't stop and uh don't quit cuz uh
We own that high school shit and uh
You know that uh we spit it
Jitterbug jam now can you dig it?

[Big Boi]
Let me walk you little kiddies through my school days
Sunday night I hit a party, missed a Monday, I'll go Tuesday
Doomsday, homeroom was lookin' beauty
The girl I wanna cut is absent but I see a cutie
But bump a flirt, I need to be doin' this homework to graduate
Saturate my body and memory on some algebrate
Bro, why you holdin' and totin' that's to assassinate
Go masturbate you jack-off, nigga take the hat off
I'm a third year freshman, I started with the best of them
But now them niggas done passed me, I'm just a baby daddy
O.G. Original Goofball, and I used to slang the hard heart
And smoke the soft softball saw through the way-hall
Niggas up in the school, they know my name, look!
But that's because my face is in like eight different yearbooks
Could've been took the S.A.T. but the streets got the best of me
Thinkin' and drinkin' and bankin' open while like sesame
All tellin' me to chill out (chill out!)
Before you be a drop out (chill out!)
Or cop out, is when you're thirty-something at your mom's house, yeah
Don't stop and uh don't quit cuz uh
We own that high school shit and uh
You know that uh we spit it
Jitterbug jam now can you dig it?

(fade)

[Intro: Big Rube]
The feeling of being 12 years old and waking up in the middle
Of the night and somebody in yo room
Your heart starts beating so fast, you can hear it pumping
The veins in your temples pulsate as you stare at the intruder
Then after a few minutes, you realize he ain't moving
So finally you let 'em hang and turn on the light
And the killer turns into your coat throwed over the chair
The feeling of sitting at the red light early in the morning
And two or three motherfuckers cross the street
Your senses heighten, reflexes sharpen, vision's enhanced Adrenaline flows
As they rush across the street, you leave the print from the heater grip in your palm
Then your heart rate and breathing drag back to normal as you realize these niggas just going to the store
Many of us mistake phobia for true fear
Whereas fear is a gift from God to be used for self-preservation
Phobia are obstacles strategically placed in society by opposers of positive existence
Through stereotyping, innuendo, false documentation, and glorification, they'll turn your fear switch to a permanent on We can change this by changing the small truth within the lie
Death is a small price to pay for respect
Death is a small price to pay for respect
You know who it is; you know what it is
Peace out

[Verse 1: André 3000]
In these troubling times, a nigga like me be thinking of rhymes
That makes my quarters, nickels, plus my pennies and my dimes stack
Don't be looking for trouble, it be finding me
Try turning the other cheek
I understand but never mind that
Yes sir, guess the light is getting dim
At the end of the tunnel tried to hit me for my rims
I never thought thirty spokes could attract so much attention
I gotta protect my own therefore I'm heated just like a kitchen
Full of pots and pan, Glock's in hand
Shots, rung out like ringin' the bells
And then that sucker nigga ran
Damn, I never thought that it would come to this conclusion
The folks that throwed us on them boats should be the one's I'm bruisin'
But naw, we don't see it that way
In '94 this is the real, it ain't no time for play play
Better believe the playas on the loose
Need to get they head screwed on tight
When it really get down to the nitty grit, who gon' fight?
Pipe, down
'Cause ain't no better time to crank it up than right now
We gots the Seagram crunk down here
And I don't hear nobody disagreeing
Orga-no-i-z-e, Mr. D.J. and me and Big Boi

[Chorus: Big Boi]
So don't spend your whole life
Living it for the white
You got a 9-to-5 and now you choose to live it right
You taking your ass to the Army 'cause you scared of revolution
I'm writing every day to stop that brain pollution
I got a baby on the way, the cess is in my chest
I'm 18 years of age and black so I can picture less
I'm smokin' and drinkin' e'ryday, so playa, fuck a job
Educated and black, I will resort to rob

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
See why in the muthafuck, do niggas be acting up
Do they want me to grab my shit and be lettin' that pistol go buck?
See I be gettin' stuck and stuff
Havin' to knock a nigga out about my clout
That's not what it's about
See yes indeed I got that weed like Daddy Q be havin' them ounces
That nigga the B-I-G be chokin' 'em out  and then I bounces
I got that lyrical flow to make a ho pull up her skirt
I drunk that Erk & Jerk, boi, thinkin' of future things to work on
I got my fuck on and then I took my clothes off
Washed my nuts up in the sink and then I got more nuts off
Cough, it's time to be out, sees bein' a pimp is bein' a pimp
I'm dirtier than the shit on the back of a shrimp
Now ain't that foul the way a nigga can spit that style
My nigga, I spit it, I did it, y'all suckas need to quit it
'Cause it's real

[Chorus: Big Boi]
So don't spend your whole life
Living it for the white
You got a 9-to-5 and now you choose to live it right
You taking your ass to the Army 'cause you scared of revolution
I'm writing every day to stop that brain pollution
I got a baby on the way, the cess is in my chest
I'm 18 years of age and black so I can picture less
I'm smokin' and drinkin' e'ryday, so playa, fuck a job
Educated and black, I will resort to rob

[Verse 3]

[Big Boi]
Well, it's that nigga that be wearing Nautica V-necks and Polo sweats
I got some food up in your thoughts and that cess off in your chest
See, living up in the Dungeon where we stayed in '93
See, that nigga the B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, yee
And when we rock it, niggas be jocking just like jock itch
You snitch, I fucked your bitch
See and my niggas G'd that ho
On the Southside of Campbellton Road
No slippin' in this pimpin', she was just a horny toad
See, I'm a mystery like the killing of Michael Jordan's father
Was steadily clockin' the hoes when I worked at Foot Locker
I'm gettin' higher than learning
Smokin' 'em up and then burning
East Point is on the map and now I close the curtains

[André 3000]
Now shit done got boring ass
Molin' when XS closed down
But niggas kept soarin', steerin'
Stirrin', being the pharm assistant that missed
Other folks but some people tend to joke about this
But it's really dead serious
You can bet my lyrics
Now ya wonder why that we done stopped and got curious
Wanting to know where I'm from and where I need to be
Now that I know comfortable living give me meat
Can I get that; ya wonder why we split back
Lure us into pitch black dark
But I sit back and spark another one
To leave ya discombobulated in that dust
Living in a world where in nobody do you trust
Then hustlin' became a major trade, but...
Us in major trouble 'cause we made, uh...
Too many mistakes off in the past
Thinkin' you could make it this world and now we laugh
'Cause it's all false
Either way ya go, ya gotta pay the cost...

[Chorus: Big Boi]
So don't spend your whole life
Living it for the white
You got a 9-to-5 and now you choose to live it right
You taking your ass to the Army 'cause you scared of revolution
I'm writing every day to stop that brain pollution
I got a baby on the way, the cess is in my chest
I'm 18 years of age and black so I can picture less
I'm smokin' and drinkin' e'ryday, so playa, fuck a job
Educated and black, I will resort to rob

Spend your whole life
Living it for the white
You got a 9-to-5 and now you choose to live it right](2506084)
You taking your ass to the Army 'cause you scared of revolution
I'm writing every day to stop that brain pollution
I got a baby on the way, the cess is in my chest
I'm 18 years of age and black so I can picture less
I'm smokin' and drinkin' e'ryday, so playa, fuck a job
Educated and black, hangin' with the G-O-O-D-I-E Mob, nigga Yeah

Take you a li'l higher, knowwhatI'msayin'?
When you learnin', when you burnin' up that smoke
So you can choke on my quote
And get my ... down yo' throat
You just don't understand, youknowwhatI'msayin'?
Organized Noize for '95, bitch!

Here I am, you know it's me
The funk style brotha with the pinky ring
People stare, women scream
'Cause they ain't ever seen a brotha be so clean
Gangsta hats, minks to match
Glass half full just sippin 'yak
Big Snoop Dogg 'bout to...
Me and OutKast just leanin' back in the back
Cadillac, rims intact
Got the blue gators and belts to match

[Verse 2: Andre 3000 + (Sleepy Brown)]
Some people play crazy, some people play like they sane
It doesn't matter, we always play in the rain (Play in the rain)
Too much of data can make the mind overload
Scramble all logic, not even you can decode
Where are we going? Can we slip and we slide?
It doesn't matter just shut the fuck up and ride
I am, a multi-pimp, so fresh, so clean
Primp, primp, primp, in a...

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg + (Sleepy Brown)]
I woke up early on my birthday, pimpin' in the worst way
Never come in last place, usually come in first place
First they chase me, lace me, and taste me
Keep me some Brandy, Cagney and Lace it
Face me, look at me, now tell me what you lookin' at
A P-I-M-P in wingtip Stacey's
Lately, hate me, it's all that they could trip on with
And know them niggas' bitch to hit
That I'm the one she kick it with
Run and hide, tell a lie, watch the P-I-stizi
O-U-T-Kizni, Dirty Siouth-sizni
The bitches love the way we ride
So if you ain't a big dogg, then I suggest you stay insiznide
I be, G S-N-double-O-P, E-S, LBC, you feel me?
You can't sell me, tell me, silly, gilly, hilly billy...
...while I slide in the 6-9...
(Cadillac, rims intact
Got the blue gators and belts to match)

[Verse 4: Big Boi + (Sleepy Brown)]
To the window to the wall, to the bathroom, bitch, don't fall
The 'Kast gone keep on humpin' and dumpin', and post up on all of y'all
Got my nigga Snoop Dogg, LBC, College Park, E-P-T
On the remix tip, we gon' sit and rim tip and wingtip
Like a boss pimp, not a lost pimp 'cause I...
(So fresh, so clean) Wearin' hard shoes, or none at all, I...
(Limp walk with lean)
Take Godzilla and the gator from Lake Placid
Manufacturing in a fashion, mashin', mobbin', stabbin'
You crabbin', your girl is sappin' and frampin'
I'm snappin' and trappin', dapper, debonair, dashin'
All I need is some Cognac, and a cold, cold cola, slashin'
Smooth, serious, smashin', multi-rubles matching
Toot that booty, I'mma toot the horn
I'm a player, every time they ask me in my...

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Somebody hit me the other day, for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie, and the Dungeon Crew
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew, ‘cause she screwed a lot
Making a nigga hit that chonk, at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats or things of that nature
Had to hate ya player, I'm dicking the ho down never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her
From College Park and Fayette, all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Beamer 840
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mama beeped seven o'clock it's gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her though, maybe she had to work
I caught her in the mall, wearing a real tight skirt
She was, fine as fuck, I wanted to sex the ho up
She said, "Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck"
I said, "Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do
I gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mama beeped me too"
She said she understood then everything was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Will CD, and a fuckin poster, it's like that now

[Hook: Sleepy Brown + Big Boi]
It's like that now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Lac now
We just, shoot, game in the form of story raps now
It's like that now, it's like that now

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Now Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha, Thumper
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy, yeah, they threw a slumber
Party but you cannot call it that ‘cause it was slummer
Well it was more like spend the night
Three in the morning, yawning, dancing under street lights
We chilling like a villain and a nigga feeling right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite
All of the bullshit, we on our back staring at the stars above
Talking ‘bout what we gon' be when we grow up
I said, "What you wanna be?" she said, "Alive"
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown
I came back home, to find lil' Sasha was gone
Her mama said she with a nigga that be treating her wrong
I kept on singing my song, and hoping, at a show
That I would one day see her standing in the front row
But two weeks later, she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due
Sasha Thumper

[Hook: Sleepy Brown + Big Boi + Slick Rick]
It's like that now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
(Uncle Ricky) Yeah
It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Lac now
Yeah (Can you tell us a story?)
We just, shoot, game in the form of story raps now
(Please?) Oh
It's like that now, it's like that now
Here we go…

[Verse 3: Slick Rick]
Throwing things, yelling in a mad high pitch
Here we go again with this psychopath bitch
The neighbors will hear you, you misfit
Can't disagree with the bitch without this shit
The price we pay to fuck women
The most pretty bitch got the psycho shit within them
Stuck up, as soon as I pop up
But see me with the next, she wanna tear the fucking club up
Check her pants, a number confirming
Learned more and more, they're just shit to dump sperm in
And you know, probably get cussed if I backslap Miss
While she busy trying to justify who cheated first
"Rick what would I want
With this small chain wearin muh-fucka trying to front?"
I oughta cut her off, let another soothe me
But I don't know, ordinary bitch don't move me
I mean, I tried to fall in love with a bitty
But straight up, just be with the bitch out of pity
So although I know, pretty bitch shady
Here I go, trying to change a hoe into a lady
Knahmean?

[Hook: Sleepy Brown + Big Boi + Slick Rick]
It's like that now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
Yeah
It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Lac now
Yeah
We just, shoot, game in the form of story raps now
Oh
It's like that now, it's like that now
It's like that now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
Yeah
It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Lac now
Yeah
We just, shoot, game in the form of story raps now
Oh
It's like that now, it's like that now
It's like that now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
Yeah
It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Lac now
Yeah
We just, shoot, game in the form of story raps now
Oh
It's like that now, it's like that now

Niggas in the point ain't changed
Niggas in the point ain't changed
Yeah...

[Beat switch]

[Verse 1: André 3000]
A nigga ready from the get-go (Blaow, blaow, blaow)
Y'all hear my shit go, it's Andre
Can yo' punk ass come out to play?
Stay in your little hole, then coward duck your head
You don't know who you be fucking with, you's better off
Dead is what I say, best run the other way
In case of physical breakdown, y'all can break now
My kitchen full of heat, if you can't take the temp
Make yourself exempt
Pussy footing around don't be getting y'all nowhere but stuck
Nowhere to duck, bullets fly, niggas die
By getting blasted, how drastic
They got the nerve to ask me why I do the things I do
I got the nerve to serve you up just like a waiter do
But naw, I take that back, that's my problem
Turning and walking away
This ain't gon' work when they be robbing
As long as Big Boi's still living, never standing by my lonesome
Step up, nigga, if you want some

[Chorus]
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Well, nigga, you softer than silicone used to pump up tits
It's that nigga down in the Dungeon with them playeristic hits
I'm quick to stop a sucka flow like menopause at 50
Original ghetto bastard, so now I makes a switch
I used to sell dope, but in 1994
I'm making Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik
But see these voices in my skull has got me reminiscing
About the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens
She had me making better grades to make a better life
But I never had no love or respect, 'cause we's gon' be alright
I ran the streets and broke my curfew 'cause I gave a shit
I carried guns and butcher knives 'cause I was steadily in the mix
Yeah, it was so hard to say goodbye, I'm a man now
I'm at the end of my street, so it's time to take my stand now
I call the wild because it's time to take the streets
So if you ain't got the vertebrae or big enough nuts, retreat
I'm ready to wet 'em up like cereal
Just an international playa, coming through your stereo

[Chorus]
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)

[Verse 3: André 3000]
3-5-7 to your forehead
There'll be mo' dead 'cause I'm a pro, kid
But Lord forgive me, I gots to keep my Milli right Vi-near me
My nine be doing fine until these niggas wants to clear me
Off my street, but in my hood-hood, they hollering ghetto
Don't got no neighbors, they hit the pipe and never let go
But I feel for them like Chaka Khan feel for you
Ain't shit that we can do but rest in peace, pour a brew
On the concrete, remember when we ran deep?
Remember at the party when we served them niggas dandy?
They know not to test us, test me, do me, try me
Tripping with that drama, my Beretta's right beside me
One is in the air and one is in the chamber
Y'all ask me what the fuck I'm doing, I'm releasing anger
Quick to dodge danger, I'm taking it one day
At a time, I got the fattest dimes around my way
You can sway with Andre, I'll take it to the Ho-Jo, bitch
Just to let you know, yeah

[Chorus]
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
It's on my friend, on the road again, I'm traveling
Do more than 65 on 85 off in my Cadillac
I got that nigga Dre, he riding shotgun
And got my pump under my seat
In case these youngsters wanna have some fun
I'd do it if I have to, busting caps with this, a heater
Load it clip up after clip, I'm packing my gauge, if I feel it
The Glock, the gat, the nine, the heaters
See, I be busting caps like my amp be busting speakers
So how do you figure that Big Boi be scared to blast you?
You 'posed to be the quickest draw, but man, I hail 'em faster
1-2-3, you need to think about the future
Before I shoot your ass and dilute your blood with lead
From my hollow tips, I'll send you to an early grave
You fucking slave, you better try another way
To take me out is truly something difficult
Don't even run up on me unless you want your brain broke
I'm out of bullets, letting loose my last clip
I'ma kick you in your ass and your nigga getting pistol whipped
Yeah, that's how I do
You know that's how I do, you know that's how I do

[Chorus]
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)

[Outro: Big Boi]
Yeah, and it don't stop and it don't quit, to the motherfucking
Organized Noize, PA, Goodie Mob, Big Gipp and all the niggas
Around the East Point way
College Park is really on the map
We coming around Atlanta and the niggas are really strapped
With the motherfucking guns and the motherfucking Glocks
The heaters, the gats, nigga, don't fear it and it don't stop

[Refrain]
Everbody on the streets
This a little thesis coming from me
When I throw up baguettes, sitting at the bar
Or smoking a little red life in my car
I don't know what you came to see
Nigga just out here feeding my kids
Throw up the duece and let me slide on by
Cause everybody wants to be a tough guy

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Cruising down the street, minding my business cause I'm trill
Stopped at the ATM, grabbed a thousand dollar bill
Now I peel like apples and peaches because I'm chill
And niggas around my city respect me because I'm real
But still the things I see from day to day it irks me
When I'm off in the '79 Seville or the Bonneville
Niggas wanna hurt me, absurd G
I know it, betta believe I tote something for it
And I got a slogan like Nike but it goes like this, just know it
And I'm not the type of person be riding around your block just flashy
Just came to the store to get some black and milds and a lil bit of 93 gas,G
Wanna blast me, get sassy, say negative things about OutKast G
Riding all on a nigga dick, all you had to do was just dap me, come slap me
You the bad man, so go ahead and touch my cheek then
But we'll be burying you and your whole motherfucking family by the weekend
I'm calling your bluff, go on and buck, I got my squad we trapping
Aye C-bone gone slap this nigga, he ain't bucking, he just yapping, yea

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Say, we took it from packing the pistols
To jacking this missiles, to stacking my crystals
Now my torpedo's even cracking your missile
When we start, ain't no stopping us
We too smart and too popular
Take your toys and we topple em
Resort to the dopplar
To the agent underground well known as Stankonia
Where trill as niggas go one and bad ass bitches be boning ya
I'm warning you, niggas i'll fill the middle of your moany
And make yo broad lick her pony up, its that platinum shit
Called zonia, tell Tommy blow me up
I ain't Mariah, bitch I'm the messiah can't no motherfucker show me up
UGK a set nigga, throw me up
Fuck catching a case bitch, i'll lace you and your homey up
Cause we the cream coming out of the crop
The steam coming out of the pot and the team coming out at the top
Your baddest or not, these niggas getting shattered or shot
Splattered for props, man you should'nt've left your gat at your spot

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Pimp C bitch I'm a country star
I got a country mansion and a country car
I got a country bitch, I made a country son
I got some country nuts, I keep a country gun
I don't fuck with nobody in this shit but Bun
So if you pay me a mil, you gotta give that nigga one
Fuck boys talk shit, but them bitch niggas know
And UGK run the streets and we put dick in your ho
Whether weed or blow, I keep an open store
I keep my hair cut low, .44 on the floor
You can test me Snow, we got the glass for sho
Get your mind on your money, cause you playing with your dough
Bitches who ready to go, say you moving to slow
If you wasn't bout sucking it, what you fucking with me for
The quarters in the side in case you didn't know
I'm Sweet Jones Bitch and I'm an old school pro, pro, pro

[Refrain]

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
Since the beginning of time, up to the present of now
There are beauty shop playas also intelligent clowns
Got they blue cuts with brown, booty grinding the ground
It's the sound that's created when we get up to get down
Stimulate my imag-ination with exag-geration of stanking light
That can't be right but we laughed
To keep from crying, sighing, hugged by cutie-pie and
Death defying acts of a Blacks not scared of dying
Y'all act like you never take no bubble bath
Gone to Blockbuster and act like you ain't never cuddled after
You poked her, stroked, soaked her, provoked her
To reach for the sky when she's high on your holster
I'm posed to, roast you, toast you, close you
Motherfucking mouth for I'm almost closed to the end
So when they ask you what school do you attend
Say Stankonia High, then throw two in the wind

[Refrain]

[Intro: André 3000]
Hello, well good evening, ladies and gentlemen
What we like to do right here—well first of all, let me let you know who I am
Well, I go by the name of André 3000, right?
And we come from a little place called like Stankonia, Georgia, right?
You know, right now everybody wants to be from space
And like want to be from the country and everything like that
You know, like, really, like, the South
It's like cool to be from the South right about now
Girls, listen up

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Torn between Saturday night and early Sunday morn'
I don't know, I'm somewhere stuck in between-tween
I'm out here knowin' hip-hop is dead
The average nigga on my corner yellin'
"What the fuck you mean-mean?"
See, we ain't even seen the mountaintop
Counterclockwise goes the neighborhood
Hand-me-downs and canned goods
Won't cut the Grey Poupon
We got to make you run, back to the drawing board
Can't afford to lose, y'all make me yawn
1/1/91... my teacher sees potential in me, said, "Sit down, son"
And let me tell you like I heard it when I felt deserted
It wasn't no other way to word it, got my feelings murdered
By the bullet of bad, the singer of sad
Songs to make you long for your mom and your dad
Plaid clash with polka dots, I hope you ain't mad
Back up, little mama, I'm about to react

[Hook: André 3000]
Yup, we ain't just funkin' around, ah-ah
No, you don't want to see me clown, ah-ah
No, tomorrow sounds like right now, ah-ah

[Bridge: Sleepy Brown]
People have ya party, but please don't be late
It's time to bounce, rock, roller-skate
Bounce, rock, roller-skate
Hey sexy mama, there's no time to waste
It's time to bounce, rock, roller-skate
Bounce, rock, roller-skate
Grab your partner, roll around, and feel the sound, ah baby
People have ya party, and don't be late
It's time to bounce, rock, roller-skate
Bounce, rock, roller-skate

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
While Scotty is beamin', lil' Pookie 'nem schemin'
What's the use of living, my nigga?
While you snoozing, I'm dreamin', I'm Tylenol PM
You amount to the same thing every day like per diem
Never tryin' to be nothing but a damn "What you're being"
One nation under the cool should be the rule
Whether young man or young lady begins or starts grade school
Silence before violence
Nine times out of ten times, the quietest is the livest
Fumblin' through your privates
Daddy Fat Sax, can they have your back? Naw!
Ooh! You're such a playa
Ooh! Your Southern drawl got me sprawled out
In your black book, my name was crossed out
Went from starting to second-string, now in the doghouse (Woof!)
Reminiscing, the party you was missing
Instead of arguments, you think about the hugs and kisses
If this is something hard for you to take
You better bounce, rock, roller-skate

[Hook: André 3000]
Yup, we ain't just funkin' around, ah-ah
No, you don't want to see me clown, ah-ah
No, tomorrow sounds like right now, ah-ah
Yup, we ain't just funkin' around, ah-ah

[*horns*]

[Verse 1: André 3000]
I'll be coming around the ghetto when I come kicking one for the treble
Y'all can't stoop to my level, I'm like the devil or whatever
I'm picking em up and throwing em down like dishes
Call me Kenny Anderson cause I slam the sons of bitches
I ain't bragging, folks dragging me up and down the road
They'll be fucked up when I gets into my calling mode
Then cut the clown up on they ass like Bozo
Oh no, then dance on top of they asses like Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer
Come niggas with machine guns, I think that is the answer
But the question "Should we take that bullshit from them people?"
I'm making 300 on my SAT yet I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to fo'head of suckas tryin to serve us
To graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel, for them is trying to turn me
Into a hate monger, and I'm wishing and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer
I think not, Officer Friendly tryin to dig up in me
He said I'm half assed and got no future
And so he sent me up the creek and shit
Stroking like hell without no paddle
But niggas is gettin smart, we back on the saddle
No longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years
It's the call of da wild nigga, uh, there it is

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me

[Verse 2: T-Mo]
As I step up, the stage is empty
No words cause I serve with my Southern dialect, so I get respect
Don't call me T, it's a T thang with a G swang
Let my nuts hang down to the flo' mane
Smoking that dang dang, making mics swang
In my 2-8-0 Z, nobody can see me, cruising down the block
Just like I was a squirrel in a world full of nuts
Damn, I'd probably be mad even if I called Uncle Sam
To bring dough to the Goodie Mo-B
T-Mo, Khujo, Cee-Lo, J and my homie Brandon B
Don't flex, I'm next, I break necks too
Rolling with OutKast, PA, Goodie Mob for the 94
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, you know what I'm sayin?

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Yeah, I'm steady bucking muthafuckas
Not ducking 'em like duck goose, I'm heavily strapped, yeah niggas
Squeezing rhymes like that noose around your neck
You can't hang with this, see ain't no thangs to this
I show no pity so take off because I'm dangerous
I breaks 'em off like I was Beat Street, see I be breaking
Speaking of breaking, break on out or get your life taken, boy
Fucking around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split
Simply means I'm bringing the funk with the hollow tips
Playa shit is how I'm kicking it
Coming around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass
So fuck it or flip it, I'll still be a playa
Puffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair
Shit, that's simply how I run my shit and that's how it be
That nigga B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, yeek
See I'm a playa, got my struggle on
Thinking about the volume and thickness of my bankroll
You see the cops is in my shit like colon cancer
Even though I never smoke that shit like (right)...yeah
I give a call of da wild to my niggas around the projects
So don't flex or get served with a pop neck shit
OG, original gangsta, not quite
But maybe when I'm locked up, lifting weights, getting swole right
Life's a bitch with a G-string, it's either in your ass or it ain't
So you can see who can really hang
But y'all don't wanna do nothing, y'all can go to hell
Ain't no playas in office cause I'm locked off in a cell
So can you feel me, nigga

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me

[Verse 4: Khujo]
Khujo, coming in dope, bring it
I got more problems than the average Joe
So bro don't come 'round me with your flim flam, hot damn
It's a jack, top of the burbs, and my notebook is a bird
K's madness into capping
Throw in a few more logs, so my fire looking through the want ads
And only red hot, desire in your pot is something wicked
But you can't feel it, stick it up your monkey ass
I could let shit ride in the past, now it's time to blast that ass
Shhh... Mr. Knighton take off your hat
Can't even my wear my locs in
Demon eye scoping, oh my, peripheral vision got it
Made you go no holds barred
Decisions, decisions to make, oops, here comes the Goodie Mo crew
And they just might want to battle you
Out with the quickness
The price of living is beginning to be a risky business
Uncaged, Parkay
How do you like the taste of hot butter melting through your biscuits?
This is your brain on drugs, this is your brain...
Dope cut niggas I hang with before there were apartments
In Chappell Forest, it's gettin horrid
The hunted child is on the prowl, yahhh!!!!!
I let out a call to da wild
I let out a call to da wild

[Hook]
Let me take you on a funky ride
All around the world
(And uh) If you let me get inside your mind
Feel your spirits fly

[Verse 1: Society of Soul]
Oh baby, would you like to take a little ride with me
Unleash your sexual fantasies
It would be so nice
Ahh, relax your body next to me
As I sing this OutKast melody
On this funky ride
So just relax baby

[Hook]
Let me take you on a funky ride
All around the world
(And uh) If you let me get inside your mind
Feel your spirits fly

[Verse 2: Society of Soul]
Now baby, now the smoke is in the air
Martell and Coke has got me there
And we wonder why you're high?
Well baby umm, it's nothing but that
Sess in your chest that got you feeling kinda crazy
So let your spirits fly
Uhh and enjoy the ride
Oh yeah baby

[Hook]
Let me take you on a funky ride
All around the world
(And uh) If you let me get inside your mind
Feel your spirits fly

(Debra Killings 'climaxing' to fade)

[Hook: Cee-Lo]
Nigga, you need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
Cause you and I got to do for you and I

[Verse 1: Cee-Lo]
I don't recall, ever graduating at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day I just lay around then I can't be found
Always asking "Gimme some," living life like a bum
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb shit, and I'm probably gon' do some mo'
You shouldn't hold that against me though
(Why not?) Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be invested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon' say this to you, I
Get high but I don't get too high
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get yo ass up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without?
Damn, what up with all these questions?
You act as though you know something I don't, do you have any suggestions?
Cause every job I get is cruel and demeaning
Sick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning
But I'm also sick and tired of struggling
I never ever thought I'd to have resort to drug smuggling
Naw, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-Lo will just continue traveling his route
Without any doubt or fear
I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
Did I make myself clear?

[Hook: Cee-Lo]
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high, nigga
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Well, uh, get up, stand up, so what's said, you dickhead?
See when I was a youngster, used to wear them fucking Pro Keds
My mama made me do it but the devil, he made me smart
Told me to jack them weak ass niggas for they fucking Starters
In the middle school, I was a bigger fool
I wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool
I used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, I call them my uncles
They taught me how to smoke herb, I followed them when they ran numbers
So in a sense, I was Rosemary's baby
And then I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
Hell, I treat 'em all like hoes, see I pimped 'em
Bitch never had my money so I never whipped 'em
See all the playas came and all the playas went
A playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit, bitch
You need to git up, git out, git something
Smoke out cause it's all about money, money, money
Yeah I said it, a nigga sporting plaits and a Braves hat
I hang with Rico Wade cause the Dungeon is where the funk's at, boy
I'm true to Organized cause they raised me
I'm also down with LaFace cause L.A. Reid, yeah, he pays me
And it's cool, yeah it's real cool getting paid fat pockets
And all that other fat shit like that, ha-ha!

[Hook: Cee-Lo]
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high, nigga
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

[Verse 3: Big Gipp]
A lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
Throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
Like a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutant's mind
I'm getting paranoid and steady looking for the time
It's eight in the morning and ain't nobody up yet
I got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap
I'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride
I'm digging through the ashtray, hoping to have a good day
I had Jamaica's best and when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head
(You got to git up, git out and git something)
Now I know it's on, my day is finally started
Back up in my crib, eat my shit, break out quick, in my slick
'84 Sedan DeVille, steady bouncing
Out the Point to Campbellton Road
The valley of the Southside flow
Everybody know about that killa that we call blow, so
Keep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit
Cause they known for jumping out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog
Here come the Red Dogs, I'm busting out around the corner in my hog
Dipping from the area, I'm scared
So one of these bitches might wind up dead, cause I have no time for jail
Fuck Clampett cops, fuck Elgin Bell
And crooked ass Jackson, got the whole country
Thinking that my city is the big lick for '96
'94, Big Gipp, Goodie Mo
OutKast, a vision from the past
Hootie Hoo!
My White Owls are burning kind of slow

[Hook: Cee-Lo]
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high nigga
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

[Verse 4: André 3000]
Y'all telling me that I need to get out and vote, huh, why?
Ain't nobody black running but crac-kers, so, why
I got to register? I thinking of better shit to do with my time
Never smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep ass rhymes
So let me take y'all way
Back to when a nigga stayed in Southwest Atlanta, ay
Y'all could not tell me nothing, thought I hit that bottom rock
At age 13, start working at the loading dock
They laying my mama off of work, General Motors tripping
But I come home banked like Hank, from licking and dipping
Doing dumb shit, not knowing what a nigga know now
Yeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
I dips, over to East Point still actin' a fool
Wasting my time in the school, I'd rather be shooting pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about macking hoes and wearing pimp fade
Instead of being in class, I'd rather be up in some ass
Not thinking about them six courses that I need to pass
Graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies
Damn, that's fucked up, I should've listened when my mama told me
That, if you play now, you gonna suffer later
Figured she was talking yang yang so I payed her no attention
And kept missing the point she tried to poke me with
The doper that I get, the more I'm feeling broke as shit
Huh, but that don't matter though, I am an O-U-T-Kast
So get up off your ass

[Hook: Cee-Lo]
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
Cause you and I got to do for you and I

[Outro: Cee-Lo]
You need to...
You need to...
You need to...
You need to...

[Produced by Organized Noize]

[Peaches]
Yeah, mm-mm-mm
That shit sure feel good
Hey playa, this Peaches
Coming back at you one mo' 'gain with a big whassup
Break out your black love, and your Boone's Farm
As I send it out one more time
For East Point, College Park, Decatur, and the SWATS
We got that Southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik for yo' trunk
And it's fat like hambone, and tight like gnat booty
So let me take you deep, straight to the point
Cause it ain't nothing but king shit, all day, everyday

[Produced by Organized Noize]

[Intro dialogue]

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Well it is I, the pimp player nigga that you heard about
Yeah, I got the money and a half a million dope houses
I got the hookers on the go and playa rhymes that I fuck with
And bury amps that pops my trunk swift
I've been a player since the age of two
That's when I learned to walk, grab my crotch, talk
Do how them hustlers do
See born and raised as a pimp, that's what I claim to be
Always claiming true to what I do and then fuck what I see
I pledge allegiance to the streets, that's where I growed up
And make my money 'cause my daddy never showed up
But fuck it, I'm on my own, I'm in my zone
Ain't nothing wrong, you don't belong, you left me standing alone
Yeah, I'm the nigga with the feather in my hat
Finger waves and snake skins, shit, I got all that
But you ain't know I'm the one dipping and dodging bullets
The price you pay when you behind it steady trying to pull it
So Dolemite, Dolemite not shit
I studied The Mack and Rudy Ray Moore
They were my idols when I was a kid
From nappy head, greasy face, eating watermelon
To drug dealer, armed robber, now convicted felon

[Chorus: Big Boi]
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Our heavenly Father, why do you even bother watching over me?
Growing up a little G, my mama thought I'd grow to be
A lawyer or a doctor but I felt like coming harder
Packed a shank up in my socks when I started kindergarten
This ain't no secret garden, so you flower niggas flee
If it is one of my own, I'm letting the trigger be
'Cause I got love for any nigga who got love for me
And then I get a slap or dap from niggas slinging quarter keys
Just trying to make it, then of age, come through, take it
I ain't forgot about y'all women who be working Nikki's butt naked
At Magic City, shaking titties just to pay the rent
Lord, trying to hustle must be something that was heaven sent
But I ain't got no sense, that's what I got them thinking
I think about Barack, strap myself and keep on danking
'Cause I be taking the rough side of the mountain
If you cross my path, I'll leave you draining like a fountain
Yes it's been like that since way back, in 1975
Been taught to hustle with muscle and even try to strive
So little batty bwoy better say your prayers
You better learn some street sense before somebody lay ya

[Chorus: Big Boi]
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me

[Break]

[Chorus: Big Boi]
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me

[Rico Wade]
What y'all fuck niggas know about that?
OutKast, Goodie Mob, P.A
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me

[Kawan "K-Axe" Prather]
Yeah, it's K-Axe, here to let y'all know
Ain't shit changed, just a couple of more names
Yeah, that's right
Organized Noize, JOI, Big Gipp, Big Rube
CeeLo, Goodie Mob, P.A., and the muthafuckin' OutKast
That's right, nigga, we taking that bullshit no mo' in '94
Shit

[Outro: Big Boi & (Rico Wade)]
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
(Peace to the Godfather ass, gangsta ass niggas, Antonio Reid)
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Time and time again see I be thinking about that future
Back in the days when we was slaves I bet we was some cool ass niggas
But now we vultures, slam my nigga back out
To make his ass black out, or even pull your fucking heater
To make his whole crew believers, you're harder than a bitch full of dicks
But that don't be sounding like King Shit to me
See now in the ghetto or should I be saying Lakewood
You better be strapped cause them niggas over there just ain't good
Just being a hustler, serving the loyal customers
Rent was due on the first of the month so I'm hustling
I buy you 50 box of Phillies at the Citgo
And niggas be wanting drinks and shit from the fucking sto', yo
But that's aight though, cause I be getting paid
And every trip I take, there's a dollar to be made
I'm digging through my pockets for my earnings got you five
Deep, there it is, now it's time to smoke that dime

[Chorus: Big Boi]
If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime
If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Time is slipping, slowly but surely
Niggas I used to hang with wants to act like they don't know me
Come and listen to my story, I gots a lot of shit up on my mind
I wipe the boo-boo from my brain then I finish up my rhyme
Take a number, I caught you in a slumber
I hit you for a lick, I'm in the slammer for the summer
But now it is the fall, I'm having a ball, making my nickel sacks crawl
To my niggas got to serving when they beep and when they call
I got the Peter, Paul and plus that Mary Jane
I'm rolling reefer out of a Regal, how could I refrain
From being rough, from being tough, from being dangerous
I'm hanging with the P.A., nigga, ain't no changing us
See you can try, if you try, if you don't, you don't
If you wanna battle, it's either that you will or you won't
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke
If you got some fire shit, yo niggas gonna always toke
Dope, is not what I be slanging on this track
Niggas don't comprehend that it be deeper than Cadillacs
You know that, right, you bite, you fucked up
You won't be getting away this time, I'm real as hell, so what's up
I rip shit wit pimp shit, I'm slanging it from the South
Talk bad about the A-town, I'll bust you in your fucking mouth

[Chorus: André 3000]
If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime
If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime

[Intro]
Greetings, earthlings. Take me to your leader (ooh shit!)

[Hook]
D.E.E.P. you want to go D.E.E.P., I'll take ya D.E.E.P

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Deeper than deep dish, hammers and vogues
Deeper than sea fish in the O(cean)
I got my gun on standby, like Coast Guards
You boast hard, you'll get your salty ass crumbled like erb, word (hey man)
You heard it here first with your master plan in reverse
I ain't the one with the curse, so disperse, yes, catching plagues
Niggas catching AIDS, niggas getting sprayed, niggas on they way
To a dead end, you won't catch me spreading no white thighs
I only see afro bitches up in my eyes
I don't eat no beef and surely not no pork
I used to drink that 8, but now I shove it down your throat
Quote, 'If they kill they own folks, what you think they gonna do to you?'
I'm Outkasted and claiming true
Aiming two at your muthafucking spine
No, I make that three cause I don't wanna hear you whine
Swine, got my folks blind, like Stevie
Me be, wondering when I'm gonna see the end
Andre Ben' slamming backs like King acts
Over Organized tracks full of facts
So you know that it's D.E.E.P

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Well, you want me to get D.E.E.P., well then, I will
What? What will happen if you shoot that nigga and don't kill
He will come back and return like Lalah Hathaway
Aiming for your skull, yeah I'm flexing on you that a way
So if you pulling a tool, nigga you better use it
Cause if you're threatening my life, better believe I'll be a fool with it
I don't take no shit from nobody
I gots the Goodie Mo crew right beside of me
Damn, no pain, no gain, so I'mma hurt you
Breaking knees and elbows like I used to break my curfew
My mama used to tell me if a nigga ever hit me
Just to pick up the closest thing and knock the living shit out of he
So if you run up, you get done up, I'mma end it
Throw the gun up out the window, see the corner that I bent it
It's just so simple how we get so D.E.E.P
Learn a lesson, pick up the album when it hits the streets like...

[Hook]
D.E.E.P. you want to go D.E.E.P., I'll take ya D.E.E.P

[Verse 3: André 3000]
No, I ain't never been pimped by the system
That's because I ain't no slave
Don't be trying to sunbathe, never lived off in no cave
Bloody old chap and in this head of mine is full of naps
And the only thing I know is how to fuck and how to rap
Y'all think I'm stupid cause I shoots 'em up like cupid
And if you gave me a basketball, I'll show you how to shoot it
My head's polluted cause I'm zooted, bobbin to the bottom
If a pair of Jordan's came out, y'all figure that I got 'em
But no I don't because I don't be having funds
The gold that I am wearing is really made out of bronze
It weighs a ton and making my neck turn green
And I got a criminal record that will never come clean
Oh, and it seems that I make babies like a rabbit
And then never taking care of them has just become a habit
I grab my tablet and get busy with the pen
Y'all could not be just like me if y'all was my twin
So you get mad and try to make me inferior
You pissing me off, I'm in that ass like interior
Oh, step in my Cadillac, let's ride through the hood
Eh, why don't you roll that window down so you can see it real good
And take a look at all the pimps and all the pushers and the players
That's living on a whim, thin ice and a prayer
Oh and mayor, can I gets a little backup
Please don't let them Dixie muthafuckas put that flag up
But let me shut up cause they say we equal
Whenever the fuck our record comes out in 1994
Yeah, yes sir, it's like that
Gonna take y'all deep, so go back

[Hook]
D.E.E.P. you want to go D.E.E.P., I'll take ya D.E.E.P

You know you fucked up when you let my mind creep
Deeper than the page of a book let me look
You let me hit the stage, that's when I got my folks hooked like...

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
I'm getting deeper than that prostitutes vagina
And pimping way mo' hoes than there's peoples out in China
I roll that black Lac with the crust velvet interior
Niggas try to bite that shit, but their shit is inferior
We rolling thick like the Pillsbury Doughboy
And I don't give a damn, muthafucka cause you know why
The Caucus Mountains and the mutant gene
You try to wipe a nigga like me slam up off the scene
You hairy bastard, work a little bit faster
Because of the shit that I done been through, I shall never call you master
You D-E-V-I-L, the cave is where you dwell
So stay up out the rain, it's beginning to smell like dog, yeah
I wonder how you would be acting if youse in my shoes
You'd probably shit your tight ass draws cause I got a short ass fuse
So what do you really wanna do when I get militant
Thought I was a pimp, flip the script if you can' get with this
They call me Big Boi, I be capping with a big gun
Run up on it if you want it, then you bite the big one, yeah
Uh huh, like that, can you deal with it, D-E-V-I-L

[Hook]
D.E.E.P. you want to go D.E.E.P., I'll take ya D.E.E.P

[Intro: Peaches]
Here's a little something for the players out there hustling
Getting down for theirs
From East Point, College Park, Decatur, Da 'Briar
You know, niggas worldwide...

[Rico Wade]
Man, the scene was so thick
Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El Dogs, nothing but them 'Lacs
All the players, all the hustlers
I'm talking about a black man heaven here
YouknowhatI'msayin? Yeah

[Sleepy Brown]
Cadillacs are coming, from everywhere (yeahhh)
Liquor vibing good ‘cause love is in the air
To all you players and you pimps, smoke out and have a ball
And if your hoe is actin crazy, put her on the wall
Now now now everybody's dancing and just feeling right
I see all of you players got your sauce laid in more ice
I hope when all of this is over, as I get old, yeah
My kids'll have a story, that still be told, woo, huh, about

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
All the players came, from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell ya, there's a better day
When the player’s ball is happening, all day e’ryday

[Big Rube]
Operating under the crooked American system too long
OutKast, pronounced outcast
Adjective meaning homeless, or unaccepted in society
But let's look deeper than that
Are you an OutKast?
If you understand and feel the basic principles and
Fundamental truths contained within this music, you probably are
If you think it's all about pimpin' hoes and slamming Cadillac do's
You probably a cracker, or a nigga that think he a cracker
Or maybe just don't understand
An OutKast is someone who is not considered to be part of the normal world
He is looked at differently
He is not accepted because of his clothes, his hair
His occupation, his beliefs or his skin color
Now look at yourself, are you an OutKast?  I know I am
As a matter of fact, fuck being anything else
It's only so much time left in this crazy world
Wake up niggas and realize what's going on around you
Poisoning of the food and water
Tampering of cigarettes
Disease engineering control over your life
Take back your existence or die like a punk
This is Big Rube, sayin' right on to the real, and death to the fakers
Peace out

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Well, it's the M-I-crooked letter coming around the South
Rolling straight Hammers and Vogues in that old Southern slouch
Please, ain't nothing but incense in my atmosphere
I'm bending corners in my 'Lac, boi
'Cause that's how we be rolling here
Deep, the slang is in effect because it's Georgia
Kicking the khakis and Adidas
Packing yo' heaters 'cause you 'sposed to, cousin
Catfish and grits is how my flow flows
Rolling steady in that Caddy but them 50 bottles got to go
See, juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginning
Now I'm just a player sipping sauce every now and then
To catch a buzz like a bumble bee
Niggas who tried to fuck with me
Get sprayed like Raid 'cause it ain't nothing to see

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
My heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock
No, my heart don't pump no Kool-Aid
Jump and you'll get too sprayed
Who raise yo' block? The one and only OutKast
Many a nigga falling fast and I continue blasting, swiftly
They ain't gon' get me, got something fo' em
The devil up in yo' grill and you still don't even know em
Show 'em who's the OK
Like collard greens and Hoecakes, I got soul
That's something that you ain't got
That's why your style is rot–ten
Stop in the land of ATL
Where nothing but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale
Swell, swollen got my pockets, business booming like rockets
Folks try to stop it but they know that it's that

[Chorus: Choir]
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high

[Verse 3: Andre 3000]
Time to drop these 'bows like Dusty Rhodes
Then I yell "ho," and knock 'em up off they feet
Like a Southern hustler supposed to do
I's in the house like... a joint is lit for my kinfolks
And all the niggas that was down since we been broke
Taking 'em deeper than a submarine
So scream when you hear the team of two
Look, my crew be thick as two fat hoes sitting off in a Brougham
I'm packing my tag backwards if you want to be acting wrong
Word is bond like super glue, it's funky like poopa scoop
And every word I say you can true

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Well, okey dokey, 'Kast out
I swear to God I got the highest booming Cadillac
The expialalistic Coupe de Ville, can you handle that, you rat?
I take my time cruising 'round the city malls
And under my seat for you suckers is your final curtain call
The one two to the gauge, P-U-M-P
You want to do a jack, I heat the barrel 'til it's empty, get me?
See, I ain't Finlay, getting in where I fit
Organized is on the track with the Southernplayalistic shit
So copy my slang and bite my shit but don't try gaffling me
'Cause sleep and you'll get served with some Southern hospitality

[Chorus: Choir]
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high

[Verse 5: Big Boi]
Well, Southernplayalisticadillac music has been laid
I may wait for all day and day, be rolling like that today, hoe
So back up off it, get up on it if you want it, ya'll
Looking for hoes and snitches was my thing on Player's Ball, yup
So now I step, rather walk with the pimp limp
While my niggas are at East Point with that College Park hemp
Smoked out is how I wanna end it on this track
So I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac

[Verse 6: Andre 3000]
Step up in my shoes, you crews sitting on Trues
And Vogues for the hoes only when we rolling through
Atlanta skies be blue, the sun is beaming, it's seeming
That I'm glistening, rather gleaming
20/20 got me leaning to the side, full of pride
Now ain't that something?
I'm dipping into your hood, this ain't Braille, but I'm bumping
Thumping out the roaches, Dungeon if y'all missed it
Big Gipp, Goodie Mob, PA, OutKast, Southernplayalistic

[Chorus: Choir]
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Hootie Hoo, follow the funk from the skunk
And the dank that is crunk in the Dungeon
It goes on and on and on, like that
Going out to the Jeeps and hoes in the 'llac
Ah suki, suki, all day, e'rr day, any day, every damn day
I be thinking about the good ol' days when I was a whippersnapper
Used to try to get a kiss, but now it be them draws I'm after
I'm just a Southernplayalistic pimp
I used to slang a fat rock, but now I'm serving hemp
I never even smoked a crumb of crack, but yo I'm dope
Mo' doper than a junkie or a Pookie cause it's on
So each one, teach one, I be claiming true
To East Pointe and College Park and the things I used to do
Around ATL, home of the pimps and the money makers
Club Nikki, Magic City and them Southern playas
I never said I was a gangsta but I will do ya
So Hallelujah, Hallelujah
One for the playas at the crib, drinking drinks
And two is for the sound, Hootie Hoo that I make

[Hook]
Hootie Hoo
Tight like hallways, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo)
Yeah, Hootie Hoo
Big Boi's on my left, Andre's on my right
Tight like hallways, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo)

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Now playing these bitches is my favorite sport
But ain't no game when they be calling your name in the court
Oh, it's Saturday night, I guess that makes it alright
Got an obese twenty sack, fully packed, it's so tight
That it's busting out the seams, yes sir, I'm set
Oh, but let me tuck the 380 before I jet
Hops off in the Lac with Big Gipp, you got a light? (Hootie Hoo)
Communication device dun went off twice
Should I answer the call, yes, we macking 'em all
We met 'em up in the mall, recall Player's Ball
Well, it's "Player's Ball 2," so I guess I'll call you
Later on, and then your whole crew can fall through
Now later on done got here
I takes a peek, now let me see, what do we got here?
Draws, falling down like niggas in a drive-by
I got up in them hoes and I told 'em bye bye
About two weeks later, she called me with some bullshit
Talking 'bout her period late, guess what I did
*click* nah, it couldn't be me, not me

[Hook]
Hootie Hoo,Big Boi's on my left, Andre's on my right
Tight like hallways, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo)
Yeah, Hootie Hoo
Big Boi's on my left, Andre's on my right
Tight like hallways, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo)

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Well you know we getting blizzard
'Cause we got that chicken gizzard
In the dungeon and scope
But some of you niggas can't cope with it
So, Opie, hip hop, to the front, to the back and it don't stop
From the streets of ATL to the slums of College Park
So God Almighty know, it's Outkast for the '94 era
You heard the player's call, we taking it to another level
So 'lujah, Halle, let me get a swallow of that Martell
And you may go to hell

[Verse 4: André 3000]
Set sail with a nigga from ATL, Southwest that is
It's that Southern sess in your chest that is
One mo' 'gain for my friend who don't take
No bullshit from no bitch who is stank
I ain't the sugar daddy nigga who will pay you
Silly of you to think that I would, but I will lay you
Down like some vocals, you can quote those
Head, till I'm dead, yes it's down yo throatholes
Don't get me wrong to disrespect is not my shit
But if you fall in this category, then you'se a bitch
Hootie Hoo

[Hook]
Hootie Hoo, Big Boi's on my left, Andre's on my right
Tight like hallways, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo)
Yeah, Hootie Hoo
Big Boi's on my left, Andre's on my right
Tight like hallways, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo)

Tight like hallways, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo)

[Intro: Sleepy Brown (Big Boi)]
Girl you cut up (Lucius Left Foot)
Girl you know you cut up

[Hook: Sleepy Brown & Jazze Pha]
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Nasty Noompsy Knightingale, fresh in that tuxedo
Cummerbund with no suspenders, my torpedo, you libido
Need to chat (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)
I'm your r-o-l-a-i-d-s, release the squeeze or release the keys
To the shackles on her wrist, she can tackle some of this
Smack on smack on some of this Dick Tracy
Arrest her, book her, fingerprint your hooker
You took her to the club and now her body is full of liquor
Off that Butterscotch Schnapps and Bailey's Irish Cream
She's a damsel in distress impressed with stylish things
Whatcha mean? (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)
In the parking lot we primp, crooked booty to the scene where I

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Oh, lord, how can it be so hard?
To put on a pair of panties much less a pair of jeans or the leotard
But I got to start by complimenting you on your physique
You unique, you best believe I'm gon' skeet once I speak
Spoke, spit, spatter, spat and I macked her just like that
But it takes years of perseverance and experience to get that cat
So why don't I chase this Hennessy down with some of that
On your back, like a cheerleader missing the final stack
As we strut, skip the line through the glass window, glance
We look fine, right on time as we step in the place
The nursery's crunk, we've come to play

[Verse 3: Sleepy Brown]
Everybody's watching cause them furs just hit the door
While the gator's creeping, crawling, oh so wicked across that floor
To the V.I.P. where we proceed to give you what you need
Throw your hands up if you feel me
Throw your hands up if you feel me
'Cause we well designed, like the finest wine
Feel good to be fly, so don't you ask me why
I got the ladies in line, because they can't deny
So raise your hands to the sky, 'cause we super fly

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah

[Intro]
Man, have you ever really wondered
Like why are we here? What the meanin to all of this?

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Sometimes life can keep you down, with your face all in the dirt
(HALL-LE-LU-JAH)
Now if you feel that left behind, need to get up and go to church
(HALL-LE-LU-JAH)
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
(HALL-LE-LU-JAH)
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh..
(HALL-LE, LU-JAH)

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Big, slide into the mode, time to drop a load
My life is going downhill like some cardboard in the snow
My bank account is frozen, I
Don't think that I can get out this hold
Feel like the figure four leglock
Like the jury went away and then they came back deadlocked
I can't move, I can't eat, I can't even breathe
Can't even buy a decent sack without the stems and the seeds
No trees, no P's to ease the stress of everyday living
But homeless people gotta suck it up wherever they living
The unforgiven or the unwilling, live a life of sinning
And expect to be as pure as an infant in the beginning
But—what about repentance?
What about detention?
What about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?
What about repentance?
What about committing the same sin
Over and over again and again and ah..

[Refrain: singers]
Why are we here? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Please tell me - what are we here for?
OW!

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Life, is nothing but a dream, so peaceful and serene
Unless you're being evil then you on the devil's team
Wide receive what you want to believe
But soon you'll have to sew those bad seeds
Please, any man can ask to get a pass
Or a cleansing of sin to grant another chance
Perhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel
Talk to the coach or break out the huddle
Whatever should you fumble your rebuttal should be subtle
'Cause he who lives in the upper room is never gullible
As you survey the syllables and sentences
The question that I'm merely trying to pose is as simple as me saying
What about repentance?
What about detention?
What about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?
What about repentance?
What about committing the same sin
Over and over again and again and ah..

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Sometimes life can keep you down, with your face all in the dirt
Now if you feel that left behind, need to get up and go to church
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh

Brothers on the block knowing
(From this point on it only gets rougher!)
Sisters at the crib knowing
(From this point on it only gets rougher!)
Preachers at the church knowing, but still get by
(From this point on it only gets rougher!)
Teachers at the school knowing
(From this point on it only gets rougher!)
Babies on the bottle knowing
(From this point on it only gets rougher!)
Junkies on the corner knowing, but still get high
(From this point on it only gets rougher!)

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Well, here's a formal introduction
Something to make you ponder
The situation's ugly like In Living Color's Wanda
(Word up!)
Now, everybody play dumb, but there's some that succumb
Or fall victim, I will overcome
Any hurdle or obstacle that's in my path
Fast cash should be the last resort, so make it last
For the risk you took, trick, you shook your ass
For some hundred dollar heels and a designer bag
Now that's ass backwards
All you got in the refrigerator is bratwurst
Your stomach is balled in a knot, you got that phat purse
Pocketbook, stop and look, pockets look void
Destroyed by the need to indulge and enjoy the finer things in life
Your dignity the only sacrifice
Slim as your chances of being somebody's wife
They seeing ya butt booty naked every night
Ain't nothing right or wrong!

[Hook: André 3000]

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Even though things started falling apart
Wanda went and bought a Honda, now she's out of a job
She would slob on a knob for a little less than a yard
A massage, you could drill her like a sarge
She would charge and rob, pick through your pockets
She got the trick's watch and the silver locket
That he bought for his wife but Wanda left her license
On the nightstand fuckin' with this white man
She met in a little red Corvette, paid for sex
Made a deal that she would never forget, you can bet
Every action has a positive and equal reaction
Therefore everything that goes around comes around in that fashion
Fast and furiously, there was a knock on the sliding glass door Bitch, it's me!
You thought you was slick the way you hit me for that lick
But you slipped, now I'm getting in your shit!

[Hook: André 3000]

[Intro: Big Boi]
Naw, naw, naw, that's part of the— that's—
Yeah! I got you good that time, shawty

[Chorus: Debra Killings]
Start over
Again
Everything happens for a reason
Good doesn't come without pain
Start over
Again
Everything happens for a reason

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Ain't it funny how you're born and then your life begins?
Just like a baby: all alone— that's if you wasn't a twin
You must begin to fend for self when the umbilical's cut
The doctor put you under the heating lamp; your spirit is touched
You know what? I take that back (Why?) You was alive
Date of conception, interception, 'cause the sperm did collide
From T 'n' A to DNA, feelings turn to chil'en's
The morning after pill didn't put a halt to our very existence
We living; breathing; soon, we'll be teethin
Our granny got a gold, and now, we want one for that reason
An adolescent mind is so impressionable in those stages, but
Parents got to parent their kids to keep them out of cages
Cell therapists, beware of this loogie that I spit:
Incarceration without rehabilitation really don't mean shit
Lil' Ricky home—he gotta serve probation for six months
But Uncle Darnell and Ol' Dirty Bastard still in the joint

[Chorus: Debra Killings, Khujo, & Big Boi]
Reset
Ugh
Start over (Ugh, uh-huh, that's right)
Again (Ugh, ugh, that's right)
Ugh, that's right, that's right
Say, ugh, ugh, that's right, that's right
Everything happens for a reason (Know that)
Good doesn't come without pain
Uh-huh, blood thicker than water, uh-huh, c'mon, c'mon, ah
That's for real, shawty, why's that?
Start over (We gots to do it all over again)
Again (Uh-huh, ah— I don't care, do it all over again)
We gots to do it all over again
Ugh, uh-huh, Cotton Club Goodie (Cotton Club Goodie!)
Everything happens for a reason (Cotton Club Goodie!)
Ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah

[Verse 2: Khujo]
Good doesn't come without pain (Pain)
Meaning, before it get better, it's gon' get worse (Worse)
Like my homies on the sick side (Side), stay dying over turf
That don't belong to urse; I mean, "us" (Us), left in the dust (Dust)
Try to catch up with massah (Massah)
I used to wanna wrap my hands around the esophagus (Esophagus) of them crackers (Rah, rah)
But Ephesians 6:12 said it wasn't flesh and blood that we wrestle against
Principalities, powers of this world
Rulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness in high places
So throw on the whole armor of righteousness
I spark this thing, but my name ain't "Bubba"
I got problems with racist cab drivers, like Glover ("Fuck you doing, man? My money good")
And brothers that wax fat ("My money ain't good? Fuck you, man")
And forget all about the struggle ("Yeah, suck my dick")

[Chorus: Debra Killings, Khujo, & Cee-Lo]
Ugh, yeah, come on, come on (Give me some help now here, shawty)
Guess what, guess what? Time to reset this thang
Start over (Ugh, to them triple-zeroes)
Again (Ugh, the K-H-U-J-O)
G-O-O-D-I-E, Big Boi
(Cotton Club Goodie) Big Boi, Big Boi
Everything happens for a reason
Good doesn't come without pain
Start over
Again
Everything happens for a reason (Listen to me)

[Verse 3: Cee-Lo]
I awaken to sunlight
That's beyond bright; this day will be done right
There is a war just waiting on the other side of the door
But I'll be bringing God to the gunfight
Can't live forever—so, have some fun, right?
Life's a bowl of candy—you can have one, right?
You can handle if tomorrow never come, right?
You get used to singing, if only for one night
But I intend to raise two daughters and a son, right?
And I couldn't've wrote this if I was hopeless
And, see, I focus to provoke this
So open wide for my opinionated opus
Like playing Go Fish, but not below this
Before I go, I thought that you all should know this
Recognize and realize before any regretting
Before you relapse, perhaps you'll consider resetting
Hmm? (Hmm?)

[Chorus: Debra Killings]
Start over
Again
Everything happens for a reason
Good doesn't come without pain
Start over
Again
Everything happens for a reason

Yo (Yo)
Just so you all know what time it is, it's your homeboy
Straight from the A-T

We finna break it off with some fresh, new shit
Yah, yah, yah, yah

[Verse 1: Black Owned C Bone]
This rap game lovely (Okay)
Konkrete play a part 'cause the Feds want to bug me (*Siren*)
Athletes want to be rappers, shawty, trust me
Bending corners in the Benz, riding like a bucket (Fire another)
Nigga, fuck it
I know some hoes slutty
I auctioned a bitch off like a nigga playin rugby
I done seen a ghetto meal, little buddy, trust me
Jump European, came clean through customs (Uh-huh)
No questions (Yup)
Perpetrators
In the booth, rapping lame, like they drug-related (What?)
It made me sick to my stomach, lost a two-and-a-baby
You don't grind, you be lying, should be castrated
Lorena Bobbitt, maybe? Yah

[Hook: Big Boi]
Tomb after tomb, boom-boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
Embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb (Woo)
Cool, ooh, that's cool (Alright, yeah)

[Verse 2: Lil' Brotha & Big Gipp]
You see, I cock back Glocks, got more pull than slingshots
Hit G-spots, I'm giving hoes back-shots
I'm a young country boy, long socks with flip-flops
But I pull up on your block in the 500 Benz drop
Konkrete, Aquemini, we taking this here to the top
Bust like balloons—who gives a damn if it goes pop?
You say it's hot? Well, let me turn it up another notch
To my real niggas, won't you pump this out your Speakerboxxx? (Your Speakerboxxx)
Fuck the cops—we making noise, and we won't stop
"Bump, bump"—there goes the boom and it's gon' drop
Old school, big shoes, nigga, no socks (Yeah)
We keep tools, see fools, bullets will flock

[Verse 3: Big Gipp]
They call me "Mr. Ravioli," "Mr. Streudel"
"Mr. Poke 'Em with the Noodle"
"Mr. Cockerspaniel in your Poodle" (*Arf! Arf! Arf!*)
After-school tutor, Roto-Rooter, addicted to Follies
Light-brown collars, stay soft, row crows 

[?]
Swimming in the fallopian of an Ethiopian
Talking a different language, RBI fly wide 

[?]
Talk to me now
Eighty-four hard, eighty-four soft with me now
Beautiful ladies, they want to walk with me now, talk with me now
Pussy-pop for me now, sell cock for me now
Fight a bitch, hit her in the eye for me now
See you when I see you—now, I'm out wit me now, yo

[Hook: Big Boi]
Tomb after tomb, boom-boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
Embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

[Verse 4: Supa Nate]
I will never fall off, I haul off heavy weight (Weight)
Fuck with me, dog; I chop you up like Norman Bates (Bates)
I'm true to this shit, I ain't new to this shit
Over a million sold on strictly weed, bricks (Bricks)
Flame-able like gasoline when I'm lit up
I prefer my liquor dark and a mean white slut (Slut)
It's over for you capping-ass rappers—get out the game
You can fool the record labels, but not the streets, man
I just tell it how I see it, nigga: Facts is facts
The first verse I ever wrote, I got a Platinum plaque
I've been to hell and back, so, nigga, give me my props
Konkrete, Big Boi, beating through your Speakerboxxx, yeah!

[Hook: Big Boi]
Tomb after tomb, boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool (Ha!)

[Verse 5: Ludacris]
Ludacris, yeah, I keep a Glock in case you like to leak a lot
Meanwhile, crankin' the volume knob up on my Speakerboxxx (Woo)
So hear ye: "Get the fuck on the ground!"
It's just a phrase you might hear strolling through the A-Town (A-Town)
They don't believe that, we'll stab them in the abdomen
From College Park, Georgia to College Park, Maryland (That's right)
So put your fist up, boy, you wanna romp?
You can Bankhead Bounce or get Eastside Stomped (Woo)
Thinking way back before I got mine
Putting bullet-holes through the neighborhood stop signs
Still wild is my adrenaline (Ugh), yes, ladies and gentlemen
Dinninin! A hundred thou', bitch! Diamonds shimmerin
Catch me with a sack of dro, reaching for "The Strap Below"
Or with some nasty hoes, eating pistachios
Y'all driving Subarus, stuck in your cubicles
I'm stuck in the air with weed crumbs under my cuticles

[Hook: Big Boi]
Tomb after tomb, boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

[Verse 6: Big Boi]
Fourth and goal:
Should I take the three-point field goal for the score?
Or should I roll
Around and take the ball up the middle
The gut—the what—the hole
Cranium overload, overthrowed
Now we got seven more
Points on the board, fa sho
B-I-G B-O-I, me, oh, my, I think He's blessing me
Excelling in harmonious melody, boy we got the recipe
Like Ragu, it's in there, giving you some of the best of me
Playa-pimp-gangsta-poet
We gon' spit it, we gon' show it to your ass
"You're a champion" were my dad's last words before he passed
But I know one day, we will once more cross paths
They say, "Big Boi, can you pull it off without your nigga Dre?"
I say, "People, stop the madness, 'cause me and Dre, we okay"
OutKast: "Cell Therapy" to cell division
We done split it down the middle so you can see both the visions
Been spitting it damn near ten years—why the fuck would we be quitting?
Fuck nigga!

[Intro]
Ghosts and goblins run amok
In the caverns of rhine
Slinging petty corruption
The seventh sign!

[Hook]
Yeah!!!!!!!
Give to you and I do what it takes!
To give it to you!
Bust...bust!

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Step into the realms of space where nobody goes
Only the baddest motherfuckers are the ones that are chose!
Some of the coolest individuals on the planet we said
Best believe that we can buck or give a damn if we care!
No collision supervision but my family is here
Now my mama taught my niggas that was under the stairs
One of those who chauffeured life and then was underprepared
But my hunger is the thunder, no wonder it can't be smothered
Or buttered up, buttercup, melt your sauce
You a Chuck E. Cheese bouncer chumpin' off the boss
What I'm trying to tell you now is that you're softer than soft
And I'm sick as a cough, did I mention it's raw?
Your predicaments flawed, flaw means fucked up
And serving out the oven not fried, slow roast
No coast, tuck your tail and hide!
You scared?

[Hook]
Yeah!!!!!!!
Give to you and I do what it takes!
To give it to you!
Bust...bust!

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
I officially do it with duns on tour
We lock down traps, push caps galore
My wiz cook work 'til it scale like fish
My old earth even known to handle biz
I serve whipped, out of whips, whip out cash
Usually keep a G-pack on the dash
Try to test my gangsta, I bring harm
I'm as slick as Freeway Rick and Nicholas Barnes
My Uptown Nikes hold caps and cheddar
My waistline hold a 4-pound Beretta
I'll shoelace your face just to learn you better
My ox so sharp it cut through leather
My rap name Killer, my street name Skunk
I mastered the music that was born in the Bronx!
I switch my slang spit from my mouth
I'm still all coast, my coast the South!!!

[Hook]
Yeah!!!!!!!
Give to you and I do what it takes!
To give it to you!
Bust...bust!
Now get the fuck up off me nigga..

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
As I, struggle to keep my balance and composure
I'm 'posed ta, propose a toast to players on every coast-a
The lyrical roller coaster, mind-bender
'Stead of watchin these sucker MC's
I'm seein just how they lyin to the general population
Don't be patient, get up and stand up for your life
Don't you agree or understand we lost some rights at 1-1-9?
Come dumb, come young, come blind unwind confined
To the situation, we facin, cause in time, tick tick boom

[Hook: Myrna "Peaches" Crenshaw]
Tick, boom.. tick, tick-boom
Tick, boom.. tick, tick-boom
Tick, boom.. tick, tick-boom
Tick, boom.. tick, tick-boom

{*explosion* forward and reversed}
{*scratched: "You're gonna die here"* - 2X}

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
When will we all, awake up out this dream
Come here and smell the Folgers, the soldiers are human beings
Man actin as if he was the supreme bein
Clockin the souls of men out like he was G-O-D and
W-A-Rrah, there'll be no tomorrow but sorrow
And horror will follow the hollow hearts battle for dollars
Politicians, modern day magicians
Physicians of death, more health care for poor health
Who makin us ill, they makin us kill
That's makin me spill my guts (chill Big, lay in the cut)
For what? I refuse to sit in the backseat and get handled
Like I do nuttin all day but sit around watch the Cartoon Channel
I rap about, the Presidential election and the scandal
That followed, and we all watched the nation, as it swallowed
And chalked it up, basically America you got FUCKED
The media shucked and jived now we stuck - damn!

{*singing - can't be heard clearly*}
{*scratched: "You're gonna die here"* - 2X}

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Operation Anaconda - ask yourself
Was it full of bleeps and blunders, did they ever find Osama?
And why in the fuck did Daniel Pearl have to pay the price
For his life and his wife plead twice?
See Al-Amin got life and Fred got dead, Hampton
To dampen the dream of all the Panthers
They got they answer for ransom
As we read together, as we dream together
Count your blessings whenever you feel that things won't be no better
But it got to, you gave me this microphone so I must rock you
Your brainwaves, airwaves, energized and SHOCKED you
Y'all got me, well I got y'all, long as I know y'all listenin
I'mma always bring food for thought to the table in the kitchen
Now eat nigga!

[Hook: Mello]
Tell them niggas that be holdin' the wall, fuck y'all

[Verse 1: Mello]
Now look here
I'm gon' hit da club man, I'm gon' get some love
I'm the coolest nigga ain't gon' spend more than a dub
I'm gon' tell that broad and her chicken head friend
No Ferrari, no Jag, no Bentley, or a Benz
Might just play the wall with this mean look on my grill
Act like I'm da hater, the Haitian from Hateville
I remember her, act like she don't remember me
When I was Cadillac'n, Coupe Deville'in, and chickenhead drillin'

[Hook: Mello & (Lil' Jon & the East Side Boyz)]

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
I'm gon' get that fresh-fly fade and then I'm gon' get laid
Like some finger-waves on pay day, my lady, you gon' get paid
Making a early morning serenade for you to start your day
Or the sound of a starter pistol fired close to where you lay
Last call for alcohol, make a fast call for the hay
The dirty Dungeon 

[?] has informed me the drought has ended today
With no delay
And a, four piece grizzle we on our way
For a brief stay in a sweet place for a petite face to lay

[Hook: Mello & (Lil' Jon & the East Side Boyz)]

[Verse 3: Slimm Calhoun]
Them boys so wild, don't crack no smile
Closet like the Wild Kingdom: fox, minks, and crocodiles
Popped tops and what we drink, so sit back for a while
Matter a fact, light that, and I'll be right back
They want a couple more bottles I got something for 'em to swallow
Anybody ever told you you look like a model?
You know the story, she bit the hook, line, and follow
Got my hooks in the back and I'm a grind until tomorrow
They call me Mack Rapalicious, and when I bubble
I blow trouble up, in your ear
They call me Mack Rapalicicious, and when I bubble
It's, trouble all up in you dear!

[Verse 4: Mello]
Yes, I know the way excite them hoes
Me cold reptilian feet, bite them hoes
Got a partner, oh his mind sick
He say he loved this ol' coke-strung-out stripper bitch
Why he so dumb?
I'm so pimp it's ridiculous
Got tinted windows on my ride I'm inconspicuous
Run with this pretty thang
She ain't yours you wish she was
We don't stop, it's so repeated and continuous
Mello Capone, Don Huggy Bear
Pokey the fuckin' pimpolous, ain't that cute slick em, out their draws I'm so infamous
Dead serious
From the club, to the Caddy, to the Holiday Inn
From the dusk til' the dawn we gon' do it again

Woo
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright

[Chorus: André 3000]
Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline?
Well burn muthafucka burn American dreams
Don't everybody like the taste of apple pie?
We'll snap for yo' slice of life I'm tellin' ya why
I hear that Mother Nature now's on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
All of my heroes did dope
Every nigga 'round me playing married or paying child support
I can't cope
Never made no sense to me, one day I hope it will
And that's that, sport, sport
Pray I live to see the day when Seven's happily married with kids
Woe, woe
The world is moving fast and I'm losing my balance
Now, time to dig, low, low
To a place where ain't nowhere to go but up, you with me?
Say shit, sho, sho
Now let me ask y'all this

[Chorus: André 3000]
Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline?
Well burn muthafucka burn American dreams
Don't everybody like the taste of apple pie?
We'll snap for yo' slice of life I'm tellin' ya why
I hear that Mother Nature now's on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
It's shitty like Ricky Stratton got a million bucks
My cousin Ricky Walker got ten years doing Fed time
On a first offense drug bust—fuck the ho-lice!
That's if you're racist or you're crooked
Arrest me for this dope, I didn't weight it up or cook it
You gotta charge the world 'cause over a million people took it
Look at me, I'm out of your jurisdiction, now you're lookin' stupid
Officer, get off me, sir
Don't make me call L.A.—he'll have you walking, sir
A couple of months ago, they gave OutKast the key to the city
But I still gotta pay my taxes, and they give us no pity
About these youngsters amongst us
You think they respect the law?
They think they monsters, they love us, reality rappin'
And giving the youth the truth from this booth
And when we on stage, we scream
Don't everybody, everybody...

[Chorus: André 3000]
Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline?
Well burn muthafucka burn American dreams
Don't everybody like the taste of apple pie?
We'll snap for yo' slice of life I'm tellin' ya why
I hear that Mother Nature now's on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go

[Verse 3: Khujo]
Officer of the most high
You touch me, you touch the apple of his eye
If they kick us out, where will we go?
Not to Africa 'cause not one of them acknowledge us as they kinfolk
Still eating pork
Abomination, desecration for beating flesh
Penalty for violation is death
Woe, woe, to the man that strive with his maker on Judgment Day
Hip-hip-hooray!
Mystery, Babylon the great
The mother of harlots is falling, prophecy must be fulfilled
The lake of fire is calling

[Chorus: André 3000]
Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline?
Well burn muthafucka burn American dreams
Don't everybody like the taste of apple pie?
We'll snap for yo' slice of life I'm tellin' ya why
I hear that Mother Nature now's on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go

[Intro: André 3000]
Ah, I stank I can, I stank I can
The funky engine that could
Ooh, ooh, yosky, wosky, pisky, wisky
All aboard the Stankonia Express
The underground smell road
Everybody's lookin' for an excuse to let loose
What's your locomotive, the Chatta-nigga choo choo?

[Hook: André 3000 + Erykah Badu]
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Back on the microphone, your number one controller
I rock the microphone like a blizzard; I'm so cold I'm tryin' to told ya
Life is like a great big roller coaster
Everything in life don't always happen like it's supposed to
Trials and tribulations make you stronger, live longer
You wanna reach the nation nigga start from ya corner
Everything don't always happen like you plan it
Demand it; over stand it then you handle it
Fuck wishing, you missing the ambition on your mission
Now you switchin'
Why you quittin' cause it's heated in the kitchen?
Sloppy slipping in your pimpin' nigga (Nigga)
You either pistol whoop the nigga or you choke the trigger
You've gots to follow through, struggle to complete your dreams
"No Weapon Formed Against You Prospers" 54:17
From Isaiah, lay a, nigga down and spray 'em
If the dealer dealt a fucked up hand of cards you've gotta play 'em

[Hook: André 3000 + Erykah Badu]
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
Yeah, too Democratic, Republic fuck it
We chicken nugget, we dip in the sauce like mop and bucket
Blue-collar scholars, who'll take your dolla, and wipe my ass with it
You living for the lotto never hit it
I met a critic, I made her shit her draws
She said she thought Hip Hop was only guns and alcohol
I said "Oh hell naw!", but yet it's that too
You can't discrima-hate cause you done read a book or two
What if I looked at you in a microscope saw all the dirty organisms
Living in your closet would I stop and would I pause it, whoo
To put that bitch in slower motion, got the potion and the antidote
And a quote for collision, the decision
Is do you want to live or wanna exist?
The game changes every day, so obsolete is the fist and marches
Speeches only reaches those who already know about it
This is how we go about it

[Hook: André 3000 + Erykah Badu]
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

[Verse 3: Erykah Badu]
I'm wild, just like a rock, a stone, a tree
And I'm free, just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I flow, just like a brook, a stream, the rain
And I fly, just like a bird up in the sky
And I'll surely die, just like a flower plucked
And dragged away and thrown away
And then one day, it turns to clay
It blows away, it finds a ray, it finds its way
And there it lays, until the rain and sun
Then I breathe, just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I grow, just like a baby breastfeeding
And it's beautiful, that's life and that's life (Ahhhh)
And that's life and that's life

[Hook: André 3000 + Erykah Badu]
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

[Outro: André 3000]
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've gotta re-route my dreams
Y'all can't harm me, it's over

Shhhh
Hush

Getting head on the highways yeah, but this what I wanna know

[Chorus]
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?

Dirty South nigga we straight gangsta pimps

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
O-U-T-K-A-S-T, O-N-P, G-Double O-D-I-E, so fresh so clean
Back with Stankonia, Dungeon Family-ee
Pearl Cadillac on D's and Vogues, flip flops, T-shirts and Dickies
It's the return of Billy Ocean, Cuervo is my drink
Stank, stank means you got the funkiest, dopest heat on the street
Three G ski, Slimm, Big Boi and this is C B-O-N-E
If you need some back-up, find your own
Ya girl gonna give you grief at home
Just tell her these hoes wanna be on the same team that she's playing on

[Chorus]
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?

[Verse 2: C-Bone + Big Boi]
Dope boys in the trap like to stack the dough, when beef come around, can't let it go
When my funds turn legit, I'mma let you know, ridin' rims real good down Old National
It's trappable—two bed, Jacuzzi bath, it's natural—puttin' cheese in ya stash
Un-taxable—futhermuckers get mad, steady watching myself, got eyes in my back
Don't take no slack when you managing the trap, if you work out, gotta get it right back
I trap by day, boy, rap by night, C-Bone in this bitch, College Park trump tight

[Chorus]
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?

Dirty South nigga we straight gangsta pimps

[Verse 3: T-Mo Goodie]
I'm pimp tight, give a fuck, niggas know what's up
It's T-Mo and Outkast in the back of my truck
We gotta simple little problem that we got to solve
It like it ain't about the money, we got to handle the job
No colors or rags, just guns and masks
We not scared to blast and dip off fast
With the Dungeon clique, just pulled a lick
Now what you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?

[Chorus]
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Outkast, Goodie Mob and the Dungeon clique
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?

Dirty South nigga we straight gangsta pimps

[Verse 4: Slimm Calhoun]
Back on the scene, a sack of green sitting on chrome and rubber bands
Paint looking like Candyland, it's Slimm, the southpaw triggerman
Flippin' work and whippin' weight, rock up, roll and get the papes
Chop them hoes and then you skate, back to the block wit the deflate
Grams the O's, slabes to whole one's da flake
A young nigga holdin big face foldin'
Pimps are known for catching runaways
A good hustler's known to keep his gun away
First nigga run up and try to jack mine
First nigga fuck up to get flat-lined
Pack still stainless Coupe and Verts brainless
Y'all don't wanna fuck wit me, the trunk be  bangin
Off the chain danglin', y'all know that I'm from CP

[?]

[Chorus]
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?

Dirty South nigga we straight gangsta pimps

[Verse 5: André 3000]
OutKast with a K, yeah, them niggas are hard
Harder than a nigga tryna impress God
We'll pull your whole deck, fuck pulling your card
And still take my guitar and take a walk in the park
Any play the sweetest melody the street ever heard
Now bitches sucking on my nouns and I'm eating their verbs
Get full, and niggas, niggas
Pop, pop, lock, lock to the, to the beat, beat
As if pitbulls went out of style, made a vow to myself
If it's for the wealth I'll stop, well put it like this
It's like me selling some dope because my girlfriend wants to shop
Wrong reason, whatever the season, hey winter, spring, summer or fall
I dont stall, slow drag wit' your brain against the wall
Yeah, nigga, naw, we lean to the side don't fall
All y'all fuckboys, tuck toys inside your pants
Just to pull it out, point it at the ground and make a nigga wanna dance
Now what that be for? You're on that reefer and on that 2Pac
In front of them ooh-wops, trying to show out, that's the ho route
Talking loud talking bout that's gangsta shit

[Intro]
What does love look like?
Love looks like you
What does love love feel like?
Love feels like this
What does love smell like?
Love smells like us

[Verse 1: André 3000]
You make me understand
What it means to be in l-o-v-e once again
Why, must we fly so low?
Are we 'fraid of heights, do kites get lost in the tow

[Chorus]
Stank love
Stank love
Stank love
Stank love

[Verse 2: Sleepy Brown]
Let me show your mind a new freaky side of love
Open up you flower please let me taste your love
Honeysuckle sweet, can't stop till I get every drip drop on my tongue
Hitting every spot of you, what you gonna do
Your body is the rhythm of the boom in the room
Up and down it seems to go
Oh my god I think I'm bout to explode

[Chorus]
Stank love
Stank love
Stank love
Stank love

[Verse 3: Big Rube]
My fingertips scan flesh so supple
No longer a couple like two in one skin
Where do you end and where do I begin
Both brains become one mind sensually
Every nerve becoming its own individual entity
With its own lusts, its own needs to serve
Longing for the love of all the other nerves
As they writhe and twist in satisfaction
In the burning chill of pleasure we both bathe
Engulfing, encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave
Of an impact so deep, but not one of destruction
But of creation, elation in the re-making
No faking in the relation, no taking in the relation
Just giving of the persona, making love after making love
'Til ain't nothing but Stankonia

[Chorus]
Stank love
Stank love
Stank love
Stank love

[Outro]
...Hahaha, yeah, let's screw (Stank love)
Let's screw
Screw
Let's screw, let's screw (Stank love)
Let's screw, let's screw
For all the Texas boys, and girls
Stank love
Stank love
Oooooh
Stank love

[Intro]
Hold up
Oooh, oooh, ooh
Somebody done told you wrong

[Verse 1]
OK, I started out all alone
'Cause my baby mama left me
Now there's nobody at home
Beginning to feel like Ms. Jackson done got cloned
Well it's some real shit and I'm living it through this song
A moving vehicle took my family
As I slept out on the sofa in the Boom Boom Room
I woke up very upset
I throw the covers back and peek out of the draperies
My daughter, my baby, my baby mama all escaping me
Like a candle in the wind, she was my friend
Like Princess Di before she died, therefore we tried and tried again
But in the end, you pay attention to the pluses
But the minuses behind make it seem like you can't win

[Hook]
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out

[Verse 2]
Round two, a single parent, what is Big to do?
Throw a party? Not hardly; I'm trying to stay up outta that womb
Or that p-u-s-s puss, I said puss
Luther Vandross couldn't make a home out of this house that we smooshed
Smashed, pushed to the limit, Smash and turned it timid
Hell everyone was suffering, the house was feeling wicked
The cat got sold, the dog got old, the food got cold
Both of our tempers were on swole
For the most, most part, you fuss, fight, fart
You build it up to break it down and now take it from the start
Repeatedly leading a path that only ends in a clash
Of two stubborn minds, grown folks blind to the signs

[Hook]
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out

[Verse 3]
K-O, knocked out by technicality
The love has kissed the canvas, now the whole family is mad at me
My daughter don't want me at her PTA meetings
And then my son, he can't talk, when I change him he's peeing
I think he's pissed, I can't dismiss the matter of the fact
Because he saw you and me argue, now the energy is coming back
Set an example, a positive pattern, keep life on track
But I'm married to the music and committed to the wax

[Bridge]
Tapes, CDs, Baby please, you make me want to scream
You're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing? (Wax)
Tapes, CDs, Baby please, you make me want to scream
You're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?
Throw your fuckin

[Hook]
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out

[Bridge]
Tapes, CDs, Baby please, you make me want to scream
You're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?
Wax, tapes, CDs, Baby please, you make me want to scream
You're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?
Throw your fuckin

[Hook]
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out

[Intro: Andre 3000]
Nigga, quit being so got damn selfish
Put it in ya pelvis
Let it work, gyrate, motivate

[Hook: Andre 3000]
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop up over, out the blue
No, after you

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
Oh, thank you Lord for throwing some shy
Bones in my body let me tell you why
If not so, I'd be too, too bad
When it comes to pink polka dots and plaids
Glad to meet you, my name is Dre
But you can call me Possum Aloysuis Jenkins
Andre 3000 for short
And naaw I don't want to see your thongs
I kinda dig them old school cute regular draws
And I will pause for your cause

[Hook: Andre 3000]
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop up over, out the blue
No, after you

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
I'm a gentleman, I'm a satisfy your soul
And then I'm a get mine
Like Wimbledon we back and forth across the court
Until we give out, do you take it all or spit it out
Are you faking the funk and living a lie
Do you really know what it feels like
To have no control over the G spot?
It's like a brand new pair of Reeboks or a junkie freshly detoxed
You feel the tingling all over like convulsions or the rooster pox
I used to not give a damn
But now I make it a point just to please you
So you can go back and tell all your buddies, I Pretty D'd you

[Hook: Andre 3000]
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop up over, out the blue
No, after you

[Verse 3: Gangsta Boo]
Let's see what you wanna do with the Gangsta Boo
Let's cut, nigga, nigga what, I'll cut you too
Coming through in a Escalade limo, tint with shade
Purple haze in the ashtray ready to get a blaze
What the biz? Nigga jump on in, relax with a lady
With a reputation known for sexing niggas 'til they crazy
What you mean, dog? Telling a playa like Boo to call before I come
You a game I'm fucking on you for fun
Join the bandwagon, nigga, it's a Gangsta Boo party
Everybody wanna join come and freak with somebody
Riding Jaguars, riding Prowlers, all sports cars
Hitting strip bars with the top down, fuck y'all
Groupie, you need to be glad you even knew me
Do me and tell all my friends you truly blew me, bitch!

[Hook: Andre 3000]
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop up over, out the blue
No, after you

[Verse 4: Eco]
Nigga, you better dial 404-485, well bump all that
But shit, you'd better call before you get here, and that's a fact
Before you get your feelings hurt
Because you caught me playing nurse
With a stethoscope running around in one of those cute, short white skirts
I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't respond to Aloysius
Peeped in the window, saw me cooking shrimp
In high heels and washing dishes for Daddy Fat Sax
And it was something I couldn't explain
I know it's a dirty, dirty game, but you should've called before you came, uh-ye-yeah-uh

[Hook: Andre 3000]
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop up over, out the blue
No, after you

[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Our shit don't mix like yay and lukewarm water
Better make it hotter splash ice and watch it rock up
I oughta duct tape your infant daughter
Show soldier ass niggas
I'm murder city's Sargeant Slaughter
Guaranteed to get more cut than a barber
I betcha I'll drill your heifer like Black & Decker
The pussy wrecker and White Water couldn't get it wetter
I'm guaranteed to never swiss cheese for more cheddar
I give a fuck, suede bucks and Coogi sweaters
What up? Whatever sable fur to lamb leather
I've seen it all in the trap with fitted caps for cold weather
And creased denim threats delivered when I send 'em
Niggas know I, FedEx my shit, overnight express my shit
Deliver my hits quick, who next on my shit list
Banana niggas need to split
Quit fucking with this thorough Atlanta clique
This here is Slum Lordz we make your terrific shit tragic
My pen and pixel make violence more graphic
I take raw coke, cook it crack, saran wrap it
One muthafuckin' verse and already it's a classic
One muthafuckin' verse and already it's a classic
Killer Mike, nigga!

[Hook: Big Boi]
Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to
The game is over K.B. baby won't you
Just quit the contemplating 'cause
I'll box you in your muthafuckin' mouth
Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to
The game is over K.B. baby won't you
Just quit the contemplating 'cause
I'll box you in your muthafuckin' mouth

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
My Cadillac got that boom, boom in it, listen to it drop
Like cereal in your breakfast bowl just jumpin' off the top
A nigga don't stop for squares or octagons prepare
I'm not the one you scared, the Piccolo Pimp done set up shop
Nigga you pop lock, for pop rocks, but I'm only poppin tweeters
And woofers and pussies be blowing purple wit' my feet up
I'mma eat up anybody who tests this, I'm blessed wit'
Super human powers, poke your chest in, the next of kin
Gone be the first one like some Mexicans to buck
Nigga you stuck like a truck in red dirt, you's in church
And I'm the deacon speakin' while ya tweakin'
The preacher preachin', reachin', teachin' speakin', being, breathin'
You're not, your clock stop, and now you're laying in a pretty box
And now pastor is only talking 'bout the pretty parts of your life
Your brother fuckin' your damn wife
You look for the pearly white gates, but you realize your fate
It's too late, cause you hate, you hate
It's too late, cause you hate
Punk pussy ass bitch, game over, who want some?!

[Hook: Big Boi]
Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to
The game is over k.b. baby won't you
Just quit the contemplating 'cause
I'll box you in your muthafuckin' mouth
Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to
The game is over k.b. baby won't you
Just quit the contemplating 'cause
I'll box you in your muthafuckin' mouth

[Verse 3: Killer Mike + Big Boi]
Roll my blunts thick, like I like my bitch
Lick my blunts and spit, like she do my dick
Attempted murder dick, for ways I choke chicks
Spit it in her eye make it hard to focus
Killer Mike gonna calm down, things gonna get a little crazy
Ol' girl might yell rape G, you might as well give her a throat baby
Goop goobler, goop gravy, no dicking her down to the ground
Now you doing the Dirty South, know what I'm talkin' about
Big Boi, my mentor, hear what you hollering about
But fuck that, I'm looking for love all in her mouth
Need her to gobble up jism, like school lunches
Need her to take cat beatings and throw punches
Like a swarm of locusts, no hocus-pocus
You wanna approach us, buzzards and vultures
We two of the dopest mic controllers
Stack big bank, honey folders
Even wit' rollers, I'm trying to told ya
Even loving, lavish, ladies, leaving, landmarks
Of Lemon-lime, lip gloss on your lavender lapels
Leaping lizards, keep me slizzard, my mind's expanding
Readily rappin' and snappin', snappin' and trappin'
That's just what's happening

[Hook: Big Boi]
Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to
The game is over k.b. baby won't you
Just quit the contemplating 'cause
I'll box you in your muthafuckin' mouth
Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to
The game is over k.b. baby won't you
Just quit the contemplating 'cause
I'll box you in your muthafuckin' mouth

[Outro: J-Sweet]
A whey you want come dis

Before me start trip
Nuff a them a talk OutKast

Brand new tune platinum hits

OutKast, J-Sweet, Killer Mike

[Hook: Andre 3000]
Slum beautiful, driving I plum crazy
Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazing

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
They don't know, but I do though
Baby my darling you make me lose composure
Fragments of a million me
Scattered across the floor to a certain degree
Where I had to give your mama a call
And thank her for spending time with your daddy
For all its worth, girl what's your frequency
And can I come there frequently

[Hook]
Slum beautiful, driving I plum crazy
Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazing

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Luscious Left Foot
What I like to do most is spit this game like sports announcers
And will pity pat them hoez down like a gentlemen club bouncer
Ounce of killa dilla, be making my game more flagrant
And once I done had some Cuervo 'bout six shots I'm nothin to play wit
Like plug sockets and babies, possums, raccoons, and rabies
Maybe Lady Luscious oba kaybee so they say thee
An old school playa pimp type ass nigga like Tony Mercedes
And will work every last muscle off in your body like Billy Blanky
Hanky panky, where did you get your gold grill cause it's banging
And I like them red hot Fila straight from Walters off the chain
Fuck them bouige bitches they don't know nothin 'bout you
Cause you push a big black Buick, so fresh, so clean on them Trues
Slum beautiful you's the world to me, shawty I dig ya
And I'm loving the way them Jordache got a bear hug on your figure
You my nigga, nigga

[Hook]
Slum beautiful, driving I plum crazy
Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazing

[Verse 3: Cee-Lo Goodie]
Look at you, unbelievably, brilliant beautiful you
You're looking deliciously divine darling you really and truly do
The very thought of has got me running at the speed of love
Exploring everything about you from the ground to the God above
Suddenly I started dreaming, traveling in time so fast
I could almost taste outer space
I saw the face of God and looked like you and me too
Hello, I'm the man that God made you for
Profound don't think, okay let's put this poetry in motion
I'm shining simply because mother earth I'm your son
Our entire circumference engulfed in emotion
Forever's gonna be so fun

[Hook]
Slum beautiful, driving I plum crazy
Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazing

[Outro: Andre 3000]
I don't know but, it seem like uh, your daddy must have gave you
A teaspoon of honey every night before you went to bed
Or was it a pack of Now & Laters cause you're the sweetest thing on my head
And I'd like to say that I'd love to make love to every molecule of you
And if you want to spontaneously combust that's what we'll do in unison
Heyy-yo, heyy-yo, we speedballin..

[Andre 3000]

Who; the fuck, said rock didn't roll, no more?

[Big Boi]
Nigga wanna think these boys don't blow
Hoe you see them snortin them coke
Chaos still don't give you a hoe
Maybe you think the music is low
Maybe you say, the niggas is wack
If he asks, want some crack
If you do that, you never come back
Back to life, reality black
Pump pump pump pump pump the brakes
Analyze shit got down to stakes
Take a shortcut tryin to win the race
Whatchu gonna do when you step in the place?
At a player's place, nigga takin my time
What he gon' say when I freak the rhyme?
How you gon' feel when I skeet the 9?
Buck buck buck nigga on the grind
Niggafied cause we still on the grind in the trap for the dope boys
Speedballin freefallin in my own moon and my own zone
Boy life is short gonna suck it up
Arsty-fartsy nigga fuck it up
Down in the trenches, press your luck
Assed out like you in the butt, nigga what?

[Cee-Lo]
My soul is burnin, about to catch fire!
I'm overheated, about to catch fire-hah!
I can't help myself, I'm on fire!
Ha ha ha ha
My soul is burnin, about to catch fire!

I can't help myself, I'm on fire! I'm on fire!
Ahh good God!

[Intro: André 3000]
Yeah, Spaghetti Junction, yes, yes
Elope, ski slopes (coughs)
Damn, yeah, check it out

[Verse 1: André 3000 & Big Boi]
Niggas elope wit ski slopes and fall like avalanches
Tootin' like it's cool: he's a fool, and I can't just
Sit around and watch those nose membranes flame
My ends is loose and you can't stop that rain
When it starts to fall
Lookin' like Ms. Pac-Man, hammers and Vogues and cat-man
I'm speaking about these pros 'cause you know nothing bout that, man
The nigga the B-I-G is high and fly like ValuJet
You thinkin' about the beatin', this my ends is never met, nigga
Black man, white man, Jew man, ain't no joke
Remember me and my cousin used to sit up on the porch
And talk about when we get older; now we up against the ropes
Yeah, they kickin' niggas door down, 'cause it ain't no dope on the streets
And a quarter pound of feet weed, that's all a nigga like me need
Talkin' about that Southern sess, nigga, you all up in that mess
But never shall you test, and never shall you quit
Runnin' up on me with that fuck shit will get you nothin' but dead, nigga

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Be careful where you roam cause you might not make it home
(In the junction, in the junction)
Don't you dare ever get lost or get caught up in that sauce
(Junction, junction)
To all you players play ya brims and you hustla chrome ya rims
'Llac and pimps and macks I love the corners that you bend
Y'all, yes, yes, uhh
(Junction, junction)

[Verse 2: Big Boi & André 3000]
Uh, well I'm drankin' on 'gnac while I'm dippin' off in that 'llac ('llac)
The junkies around my way are always smokin' up on that crack
Be layin' them College Park hoes flat on they backs (backs)
Livin' the life of pimps steadily makin' this paper stack
Niggas don't understand the master plan, crumble yo' herb, man
'Til they start kickin' the do' in, then we ready to blast them
Out (Out) like 'Kast ('Kast), we 'bout to crash (crash)
So mayday, may Dré, knock 'em up off they ass boi
We struggle like fat hoes just to get things that those
People got we forgot they always gonna keep a plot
Right up they sleeve you won't believe they deceive like weave
Thieves can't break in your crib and leave in that good life too
So gimme me and then I'm straight, as eight-oh-five
See, blindfolds can't cover three eyes
We wise to the fact so we attack with what we know
Heaven is the only good life, so what you strivin' fo'?

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Be careful where you roam cause you might not make it home

'Llac and pimps and macks I love the corners that you bend
Y'all, yes, yes, uhh
(Junction, junction)

[Verse 3: Big Boi & André 3000]
Well, like flip-flops and football socks
A nigga be rockin' the mic like birthdays
Lil' Jon and Sercy, so are you worthy?
I'm callin' yo' ass a flawed pimp
Yappin' about this crew you run wit'
Bankhead bouncin' to that dumb shit
So what mo' can you come wit'?
Yeah, they can bite, but cannot be us
They can come and pick up little slang but cannot see us
You ought to be ashamed, trying to fit in my adidas
So Run like D.M.C. is me and, no, don't got no heater
Well, we zippin' around the corner in that golden stankin' Lincoln
I got my heat up under my seat
Just in case these youngsters tryin' to take it
Pullin' the pistol on another black man was never the plot
But sometimes my brothers lose theyself and try to take my spot
They come like black stallions in the night
Usually around fo' or five is when they figure the time is right
When you good and sleep; I couldn't sleep until I seen it
'Wit my own eyes, 'til they come over the hill—surprise

[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
Be careful where you roam cause you might not make it home

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Have you heard the news today?
They say a little 14-year old little girl had a baby on the way
Too much for her little mind to bear
And that type of news to her Mama she cannot spare

[Hook: André 3000]
Toilet Tisha, damn we miss you
Toilet Tisha is the issue
Damn we miss you, Toilet Tisha
Damn we miss you

[Interlude]
Tisha? Tisha! Tisha, girl what you doing?
Oh my god, oh, Tisha, Tisha!
Ah, no! Tisha! Tisha!
Ah, no! Not my baby!
Ah, no! I love you, no!
Ah, good Lord, ah!

[Bridge: André 3000]
Don't go away
Don't you dare go away from me, girl—I can help you
Don't go away dont you dare leave
Don't go away, it ain't a thang
Don't go away

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Five thousand, one hundred ten days is a short period of time
A mere fourteen years on this precious mother earth
You see Tisha had issues
And her decision making skills were still in its early stages
You know what I'm talking about
Therefore she could not properly handle a blessing in which
She thought to be an obstacle in her path to adulthood
Pause, Just like a brother with a thousand pauses
Should I, shouldn't I, I can't, I have to, Mama will never see me the same
Daddy and Big Mama I know all of them gonna be ashamed of me
Are just a few thoughts racing through her cranium
As she sits on top of the pale, cold porcelain seat in the rear of the house
The unthinkable moments away from becoming reality, sadly with no clue
And no way of expressing her feeling to her mama or anybody else in her life
Tisha done came to the crossroads and now she got to choose
Fatality, fatality, fatality, fatality

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Hello lord, it's me again
I just wanna make love to the whole globe
And all her girlfriends
Now don't that make ya mind move
Like smoke patterns, me on my way to Saturn wit' a bomb
Nam-viet, Viet or Saudi Shawty
I figure before the first gun blast, they know who gon' win
Now won't that make us all fools, like class clowns
Praying Private Ryan comes 'round
Sound travels at one-thousand-one-thirty feet per second
Niggas in the street they want it, hurry
When niggas stop biting that's when 3000 starts to worry
A little knowledge from the college of wizard Ray Murray
Answer quick: do you know what desire is? (Huh?)
Apparently not, that's why you get what you got
Now answer this: do you know what fire is? (Yeah!)
The body of hot, the motivator of pots
Snot, spit, shit are characteristics of release
Ask your niece or nephew, you think we left you
What the future holds in its sweaty palms
Think I'm finna vom'?
You move it like you mean it, she'll come
Prom night might excite a down right fight like
White blood cells to the common cold rebel
Night gets jealous of day, play is no longer
The feelin' gets stronger than ammonia sticks inhale

[Chorus: Witchdoctor]
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
And we some home-made bombs
Finna blow right up in your face

[Verse 2: B-Real]
Look at the way you look at me, I see it on your face
All your hate emanates, but you still hesitate
'Cause you want inside of my head, but don't know how
To brainwash me to be a commercial clown
Fuck that, I see the way you were
See the way you smirk
I'm catching you where you work
God only knows all the trouble that grows
Deep beneath my soul dealing with you assholes
Can I blast those who point the finger at me
Who criticize and talk shit so freely
Fuck XXL—you're a size too small
I should hire Eminem so we can kill you all
Whether you live to talk shit about the Real
Then kiss my ass in person how much you love the Hill
I'm the outcast coming to blaze the grass
Outlaw due to my life that's come to pass
Dré, pass me the glass of wine
So I can pour it over my homies grave and mine
For all those who fallen and answered when God was calling
Jump into my ragtop and get all in
I'm the bomb, planted in your car—why you frozen?
Pop the tape in ignite the explosion
The world is mine, the world is yours, the world is ours
The world is lost, the world is tossed

[Chorus: Witchdoctor]
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
And we some home-made bombs
Finna blow right up in your face

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
With a one-two punch, B-Real and André drop they verses
Your homeboy Daddy Fat Sax playin' clean-up, so it worsens
People and persons on the opposite teams, oh, yes, its curtains
No bullets burpin', oh, just lyrically twerking, oh
Making a statement when you freestyle and your mind is in a free state
It's kinda hard to execute when you ain't feeling it that day
Jumpin' the gun and rushing your flow
Babbling on the mikie like auctioneer
Got the public's ears fucked up, can't hear
Atlanta, Georgia where y'all at? (right here)
OutKast this Dirty South to death the Dungeon Family Camp
Got this thang licked like stamps and nine-volt battery end caps
Making that music that make your neck hurt
And the beats that bother your back in my Cadillac
Six woofers and four amps
Lo pro vogues on swole, with the carriage lamps
Diamond tucked velour pistol in my lap
Come in peace, but then explode like boobie traps

[Chorus: Witchdoctor]
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
And we some home-made bombs
Finna blow right up in your face

[Outro: Debra Killings]
Do-do-do, do, do-do-do
Do-do-do, do, do-do-do
Do-do-do, do, do-do-do
Do-do-do, do, do-do-do

[Intro: André 3000]
Sophistafunk, aristocats
Distinguished dogs, clean up your acts
Pull up your pants, ladies and gents
Please, act like you got some sense
You know what I really wanna know?
Where do all the good girls go?
What clubs they hang at?

[Chorus: André 3000]
Behold
A lady
I see you standing on the wall
Clap, clap, you deserve it all
Behold (Candy-coated unicorns are)
A lady (Quite hard to find)
I see you standing on the wall
(The classic lady, a rare breed indeed)
Clap, clap, you deserve it all
(Is that make and model discontinued?)

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Today, I might snow, tomorrow, I'll rain
3000's always changing but you stay the same
And I need that
Hey, I need that (in my life)
When I feel washed up and inadequate
And throw all my songs away, no matter how mad I get
You make me smile, you make me smile
You make me smile, you make me (Oh)
You're the anchor that holds me down
When my ship is sinking, you won't let me drown
And I'm grateful (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Chorus: André 3000]
Behold (Maybe they disappeared with the dinosaurs?)
A lady (Oh, but that's such a Big Bang Theory)
I see you standing on the wall (Maybe they're still around?)
Clap, clap, you deserve it all
(But only to be seen with appreciative eyes)
Behold (Maybe they were taken for granted?)
A lady (And lost all their magic)
I see you standing on the wall (Oh, how awful)
Clap, clap, you deserve it all (Oh, so tragic)

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Yo mama's old fashioned, yo daddy don't play
You'll always be this lovely 'cause they raised you that way
Hallelujah! Thank ya, Jesus! Thank ya, Lord!
Thank ya, Jesus! Thank ya, Lord!
Thank ya, Jesus! Thank ya, Lord!
You're not extra extra, you're so plain Jane
The ying to my yang, darlin', you've got that thang
And you know it, but yet you don't
But yet you don't and that's what's so cool
You don't say too much, but when you do, it's profound
In the street, you hold your head high
At home, you get low down for me
(Can't get no lower, can't get no lower, can't get no lower, yeah)
Oh, you're the anchor that holds me down
When my ship is sinking, you won't let me drown, ah-ah-ah-ah
Sad, but one day our kids will have to visit museums
To see what a lady looks like

[Chorus: André 3000]
Behold (So if you find one, I beg you, hold her tight)
A lady (Yes, if you spot one, good sir, treat her right)
I see you standing on the wall (Benjamin André, signing off)
Clap, clap, you deserve it all (Thanks a million)
(Good luck and goodnight)
Behold
A lady
I see you standing on the wall
Clap, clap, you deserve it all
Behold
A lady
I see you standing on the wall
Clap, clap, you deserve it all
Behold
A lady
I see you standing on the wall

[Verse 1: André 3000]
You're all I've ever wanted, but I'm terrified of you
See, my castle may be haunted, but I'm terrified of you
I've cast my spell on millions, but I'm terrified of you
Baby, I do this from the ceiling, but I'm terrified of you

[Chorus: André 3000]
I wait my whole life to bite the right one
Then you come along and that freaks me out
So I'm frightened
Ooh, Dracula's wedd-

[Verse 2: André 3000]
I've never ran from no one, but I'm terrified of you
See, my heartbeat is a slow one, but I'm terrified of you
I've been around for ages, but I'm terrified of you
Done my thang across the stage, but yet, I’m terrified of you

[Chorus: André 3000]
I wait my whole life to bite the right one
Then you come along and that freaks me out
So I'm frightened (Ooh)
Ooh, Dracula's wedding

[Post-Chorus: André 3000]
Ah, you know I'm terrified
Oh, you know I'm terrified
You know I'm terrified
Shh-shh! Here she comes

[Bridge: Kelis]
Three-thousand, three-thousand
Three-thousand, three-thousand

[Verse 3: Kelis]
Give me the chance to dance romance
Don't run, I'm not the sun (Ha)
So much at stake, oh, bad choice of words
But I'm not the gun (shut up)
With silver bullets
And I can count (One, two, three)
Plus, I make great peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, Van Helsing

[Outro: Kelis]
For richer or poorer
Through sickness and in health
'Til death do us part
'Til death do us part
You only live once
Well, not in our case
'Cause we live forever

[Chorus]
Let's kiss, not fight
Try to do what's right tonight
Make love, not war
What the hell are we living for?
Let's kiss, not fight
Try to do what's right tonight
Make love, not war
What the hell are we living for?

[Verse]
Tonight we'll make the prettiest song
That no one will ever hear
No one will ever hear
No one will ever
These ain't the times to be alone
Cliché, the end is near
Cliché, the end is near
Cliché, the end is
Quickly approaching while we carry on
No one is promised another day
Why can't the story end like fairytales often do?
Before I let you leave, I've got to say

[Chorus]
Let's kiss, not fight
Try to do what's right tonight
Make love, not war
What the hell are we living for?
Let's kiss, not fight
Try to do what's right tonight
Make love, not war
What the hell are we living for?

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Let's kiss, not fight
Try to do what's right tonight
Make love, not war
What the hell are we living for?
Let's kiss, not fight
Try to do what's right tonight
Make love, not war
What the hell are we living for?
Let's kiss, not fight
Try to do what's right tonight
Make love, not war
What the hell are we living for?
Let's kiss, not fight
Try to do what's right tonight
Make love, not war
What the hell are we living for?

[Intro: Aaliyah]
Age ain't nothin' but a number, nothin' but a number
Age ain't nothin' but a number, nothin' but a number
Age ain't nothin' but a number, nothin' but a number
Age ain't nothin' but a number, number, number, number–ber

[Chorus: André 3000]
Pretty pink, baby blue
(Why don't) Why don't you teach me something new?
(We're all) We're all just babies in my view
So crawl, baby, crawl, baby
Pretty pink, baby blue
(Why don't) Why don't you teach me something new?
(We're all) We're all just babies in my view
So crawl, baby, crawl, baby

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Miss Lady, you could have been born a little later—but I don't care
So what if your head sports a couple of grey hairs?
Same here, and, actually, I think that's funky
(In a Claire Huxtable-type of way)
Miss Lady—it looks to me like you need a little juice in your life
Call me when that big ol' house gets lonely-fied
And I'll teleport from here to there
You show me how it's supposed to be done
I'll make sure you have young fun

[Chorus: André 3000]
Pretty pink, baby blue
(Why don't) Why don't you teach me something new?
(We're all) We're all just babies in my view
So crawl, baby, crawl, baby
Pretty pink, baby blue
(Why don't) Why don't you teach me something new?
(We're all) We're all just babies in my view
So crawl, baby, crawl, baby

[Verse 2: André 3000]
You're sophisticated
Just me and Miss Lady
You've got me talkin' like a baby (You make me talk baby talk)
(Baby talk) She's sophisticated (You make me talk baby talk)
Just me and Miss Lady (She makes me talk baby talk)
You got me talkin' like a baby, like "ga-ga" and "goo-goo"
Oh, mo-mmauhhhhhhh, yeah
You're sophisticated (You make me talk baby talk)
Just me and Miss Lady (You're so experienced)
You got me talkin' like a baby (Teach me somethin' new)
Teach me somethin' new
You're sophisticated
Just me and Miss Lady
You got me talkin' like a baby
Sophisticated
Just me and Miss Lady

[Verse 1]
Everybody needs a glass of water today
To chase the hate away
You know you've got company comin' over
So you scrub extra hard
And everybody needs somebody to love

[Bridge]
Before it's too late, it's too late
Oh, don't nobody wanna grow old alone

[Verse 2]
Everybody needs someone to rub their shoulders
And scratch their dandruff
And everybody need to quit actin' hard and shit
Before you get your ass whooped (I'll slap the fuck out ya!)
And everybody needs somebody to love
Before it's too late, it's too late

[Chorus]
Love hater, love hater
Hater of love
Love hater, love hater
Hater of love
Love hater, love hater
Hater of love
Love hater

[Outro]
Everybody needs someone to love
Everybody needs someone to love
Everybody needs someone to love

[Intro: André 3000]
I hope that you're the one
If not, you are the prototype
We'll tiptoe to the sun
And do things I know you like

[Chorus: André 3000]
I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again

[Verse 1: André 3000]
(Today) Today must be my lucky day
Baby, you are the prototype
Do something out of the ordinary
Like catch a matinée
Baby, you are the prototype

[Chorus: André 3000]
(I think I'm) I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again

[Verse 2: André 3000]
If we happen to part
Lord knows I don't want that, but hey
We can't be mad at God
We met today for a reason
I think I'm on the right track now

[Chorus: André 3000]
I think I'm in love again
I think I'm in love again

[Bridge: André 3000 & Marianne Lee Stitt]
(Let's go) Let's go to the movies, yeah
And, action!
Come here
Nah, come here
Uh-uh, I said, come here
Come here

[Chorus/Outro: André 3000]
I think I'm in love again (Girl, right now)
I think I'm in love again (I wanna say)
I wanna say, Stank you (Stank you) very much
For picking me up and bringing me back to this world
I think I'm in love again (I can't, I'm not)

I think I wanna say Stank you, Stank you smelly much

There were flashing lights when we met
Not the typical place you would be
In a flash of time my mind was set
I knew you were the girl there for me

[Pre-Chorus]
And though you just wanted to leave (Ooh)
Imagine how great it could be (Ho)
The F-U-T-U-R-E (Spells the future, girl)
Sit down hold your horses don't leave (Where you going, girl?)

(Woo, woo)
(Woo, woo)
Yessir, haha, lil' Skateboard P
(Woo, woo)
Hey, Mr. Vener
(Woo, woo)
Uh-huh, yo, hola
(Woo)

[Verse 1]
Billionaire Club, muchacho
Assorted flavors in these helados
Inspire young minds, and stack my nachos
With the raw determination of a vato
Run across the border with bricks in his poncho
Face like a shot when it's bussin' my glocko
Planning these things 'til I die
When the Holy Father hand me my wings
When I was young, yo, the teacher couldn't stand when we dreamed
Giving me music like drugs in the hand of a fiend, they shoot it up
See me on the TV, the cuties, they wanna fuck
Both residential, that's plush, they couped it up
Got more hits than a zip, who want a nug'?
I can go back in time, you be Judge Ito
With my minute repeater, I know you're thinking, "Neato"
It repeats the minutes, something like your TiVo
But it's three-hundred thousand more with no remote
Jacob and Lorraine, I used to deal with Tito
But he clowned me and told me that my money's Fritos
Now the Enzo doors go up like a D-Lo
Ree-on, same song sung by my man Nigo
SLR, when the doors go up it's like a fresh L jar
Nigga, we boss, he shall not get hot, he too frost
(Uh) Yessir

[Chorus]
My nigga, close your eyes
Just picture yourself just holdin' pies
Implement a plan and you surely rise
This promised by the man that controlled the skies
Don't you see? I know that shit so ill
Better yet, doggie, just tell me how ya feel
Haha, how you feel, dawg?
We just picture thinkin', dreamin', schemin'
Bleedin', readin', all in the late night
Shakin', boilin', lacin', bakin'
Shapin', shavin', gotta get this cake right
As I serve it, you just burn it
Breathe it, learn it, now watch you take flight
Nigga, how does it feel? Haha, yessir

[Verse 2]
Nigga, you don't know me
I'm part Howard Hughes, part horny, part holy
First trick on the ramp is the rockin' rollie
Keep one on my staff with a new pro chromey
It bequeaths me to mention that I've been bitten
But affords me to chuckle at what critics have written
He dresses insane, but his music admire
Ask Anna Wintour from Vogue and Esquire
And Vanity Fair; you like Kennedy here
But you should guess who's in the insanity chair
Now it ain't about what I want
Still thumbin' through my life like it's drugstore porn
It's one thing to say that you did it
It's one thing to lie about your digits
It's one thing to say that you live it
It's another for you fuckers to admit it
But I admit I got all this paper
Plus the prettiest faces that's offered by nature
I drive a case'per, 'scuse me, Casper
Wanna meet 'em in my house, I got space like NASA
But it don't make me happier by itself, it's sadder
Or like my sister Stace when she lost her pappa
Or Ben dad gettin' a stroke, and nothin' to trap her
John could do, it's ironic but true
A man dies, baby born, it's fair as Peru
It's a simple clue between us and imposters
We hop in the air and don't care what it cost us
Now I'm with N.E.R.D. with a pit full of moshers
I guess you could say that we fly like saucers
Zappin' at niggas, we're classin' at vigor
The cash and crash whippers, the Thrasher Mag gripper
Go 'head and say it, "You a rappin' ass nigga"
Yessir

[Chorus]
My nigga, close your eyes
Just picture yourself just holdin' pies
Implement a plan and you surely rise
This promised by the man that controlled the skies
Don't you see? I know that shit so ill
Better yet, doggie, just tell me how ya feel
Haha, how you feel, dawg?
We just picture thinkin', dreamin', schemin'
Bleedin', readin', all in the late night
Shakin', boilin', lacin', bakin'
Shapin', shavin', gotta get this cake right
As I serve it, you just burn it
Breathe it, learn it, now watch you take flight
Nigga, how does it feel? Haha, yessir

[Outro]
Nigga, you don't know me
(Woo, woo)
(Woo, woo)
(Woo, woo)
(Woo, woo)
(Woo, woo)

[Intro]
Our Father, which art in heaven
I'm so grateful
Of all the beautiful things
That you are allowing me to see
The birds, the bees
The ability to do what I do
The opportunities
I know you love me, man
And I think it's time
And my duty, to tell the world (Jesus is my daddy I'm tellin' you, oh)

[Verse 1]

[?]
Angels 'round me, won't let me fall
You watch for who I'm friends with
I got tattoos, you forgive me
You know I'm so sensitve
You know I'm chased by women
You know my mind is driven
To you, my heart is given

[Chorus]
You're the greatest
You're the greatest (wow)
You're the greatest (Jesus is my daddy I'm telling you)
You're the greatest, don't let me fall

[Verse 2]
They don't understand what you do for me (do for me)
And judging by my actions
They don't know I believe (I believe)
Not talking 'bout what I wear
Where I drive and where I sleep
I mean the ability to hear, feel and see

[Chorus]
You're the greatest
You're the greatest (wow)
You're the greatest (Jesus is my daddy I'm telling you)
You're the greatest, don't let me fall

[Verse 3]
Thank you for my brothers
Thank you for my daddy (daddy)
Thank you for my mother
So happy that she had me
For that I was shooting love
And hearts that's filled with hatred
Thank you for my power
It won't intoxicate me

[Chorus]
You're the greatest
You're the greatest (wow)
You're the greatest (Jesus is my daddy I'm telling you)
You're the greatest, don't let me fall

[Verse 4]
I'm tryna teach the kids
There's more than meets the eye
And if they keep you first
Then apply it'll make you fly
I'm not saying that I'm the fruit
That femmish minded need
But when I listen to you
I know I could trul
