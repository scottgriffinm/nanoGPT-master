t you can't
You've worked at this plant so long, you're a plant
Look at your goddamn boots!
For Christ sakes, they're startin' to grow roots!
On this mic, you get faded
You look like a pissed-off rapper who never made it
And why you fuckin' with the gay guy, G?
When really you're the one who's got the HIV
Man, I'm done with this clown, he's soft
Fuck it, I'll let homegirl finish you off

[Verse 4: Miz-Korona (as Vanessa)]
Guy like you'd never get a real woman
You jackass, go jack off; that's the only way you cummin'

[?]

[?] you hangin' from the tree
Fuck with me, 

[?]

[?]

[Verse 1]
Two jumps in a week, I bet you
Think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never, ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not

[Chorus]
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

[Verse 2]
Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out

[Chorus]
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Oh, it's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing that you've ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing you've had has gone away

[Chorus]
So don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
It's like Swizzy blowin up a doobie
Tell a bitch she like me, rolling with my crew
And I'm like Kool G Rap chillin in a coupe with a
What? And I get a uh?
You know I got that camouflage on
And I came to war, bring your guns on
And I'm a full foot long like a footlong
From Subway, remember my young days
I'm too on!

Through the glisten and glamours
We pose for the cameras
Ghetto niggas with me, they pose with their hammers
Ghetto girls with me, pink toes in the sandals
No dirty laundry, get your nose out my hamper!
Clothes in my hamper? Bathing Ape camouflage
Brands from Japan, you would think I was a samurai
Drop crotch Jeremy Scott pants, rich as Hammertime
Getting dirty money but I keep my hands sanitized
Shout out to my mom, give props to my pops
Cause my dad made this muthafuckin swag that I got
Niggas getting mad cause we brag to the top
You mad cause you you, I'm glad that we...not

[Intro]
This just in, we found your bitch
She's in my knapsack, yeah
I was lookin' around my knapsack, man
And like I seen all the regular hoes right
But then, I think, I think I seen your bitch

[Verse 1]
I tell her, "Bitch, chill, ride like a big wheel"
Big deal, put a mill on a fish scale
Niggas hatin' 'cause the way the paper makin'
But baby, I'm Canadian, so I'm bringin' home the bacon
They ain't see me in a long minute
I'm gon' get it, you fake and I'm authentic
Bitch, I got it from the low, no bar didn't
Blue hairs on the kush like Marge in it, start with it
Tell a bitch back that ass like she tryna park with it
Hit the gas on the light like a nigga tryna spark with it
I'm a G though, lookin' like Ne-Yo
No I ain't a singer but green, I never see low
How you ain't fuckin' but expectin' me to eat though?
If you ain't fuckin', I'm expectin' you to deep throat
Got a Asian chick, her name is Me Ho
I just say her name when they ask what the cream for
Fuckin' duck tape got me stickin' to the G code
G4, high like fee fo fi fum
Young wild dumb motherfucker got a tongue
High young, die tryin' get the green, nigga fungi
Ill like Will, nigga shout out the alumni
Wah gwaan nigga, ain't shit, y'all pengi
Alert, bitch up in my knapsack
Tell a pussy nigga take a cat nap
Tryna get this cheese like a lab rat
Hatin' niggas tryna set a rat trap
Um, she be on rum
Gave me so much brain, a nigga just dumb
Got the pussy waitin' on the outcome
Mark spots like X, nigga Malcolm
Fuck around, you gon' make a nigga scout him
Doubt him, that nigga ball like the out rim
Bitches waitin' on me 'cause they way the paper on me
I'm makin' paper, hatin' niggas only gon' make it for me
You only one of the fakest, just actin' like you the homie
She only here for my cake 'cause she actin' like she my only
Bag her when she get lonely, slap her up in the mornin'
And tell me, "Tory, I'm horny" I make her feel like a orgy

[Outro]
Wassup motherfucker
I got your bitch in my sock, nigga
Your bitch is now in my sock
She couldn't make it to my knapsack
So she, she jump in my sock
And then, you know I carry her along this path that I walk everyday
Called swave shit
Swavey on the lip ring, bitch
Sincerely Tory, March 26th, niggas
Canada, Toronto, Toronto, Toronto

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, papers
Oh, oh, oh, papers

[Verse 1]
I can't get to work on time
Can't believe the words to her I just said
But who the hell argue and fight like dogs at 6 in the morning?
I know it's gonna be some more shh... tonight, oohh
Our pastor's calling, telling me I done went too far
And I'm seen around town and my friends can't recognize me
'Cause I took a chance on love
It's like I'm dying (oooh dying)

[Chorus]
For you, I gave my heart and turned my back against the world
'Cause you were my girl, girl, girl
I done damn near lost my mama, I done been through so much drama
I done turned into the man that I never thought I'd be
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers
I done took all I can take, but you leave me no options, girl
I can't deny how much I love you, I done gave up everything I had to
As hard as it is, I'm afraid I gotta say
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers
I done took all I can take, but you leave me no options, girl
Oh, oh, oh, papers
Oh, oh, oh, papers

[Verse 2]
I'm losing my mind, can't figure out who's wrong or right
I know it's you I love, but then, I also know it's you I don't like
You claim you hate who I was, but that's the reason you here now
You think I don't know what's up, but sweetheart, that's what ruined us
I ain't afraid to say I got needs, but the only time you here for me
Is when the bottles popping and everything is sweet
But I, I'm tired of sleeping in the other room spending them long nights
Trying to figure out what in the hell in my heart I ain't do right

[Chorus]
For you, I gave my heart and turned my back against the world
'Cause you were my girl, girl, girl
I done damn near lost my mama, I done been through so much drama
I done turned into the man that I never thought I'd be
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers
I done took all I can take, but you leave me no options, girl
I can't deny how much I love you, I done gave up everything I had to
As hard as it is, I'm afraid I gotta say
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers
I done took all I can take, but you leave me no options, girl
Oh, oh, papers
Oh, oh, oh, papers

[Bridge]
(Ready, ready, ready, ready)
All my fellas up in here
If you had enough and you're ready to sign, say
(Ready, ready, ready, ready)
I'm ready, yes I am
All my ladies, if you sick and tired
And you're ready to sign, say
(Ready, ready, ready, ready)
Oh, I can't keep living this life, I said, I'm leaving for the last time I'm
(Ready, ready, ready, ready)

[Chorus]
I done damn near lost my mama, I done been through so much drama
I done turned into the man that I never thought I'd be
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers
I done took all I can take, but you leave me no options, girl
I can't deny how much I love you, I done gave up everything I had to
As hard as it is, I'm afraid I gotta say
I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers
I done took all I can take, but you leave me no options, girl

The world turns, the kush burns

So look, learn
All I need's my cake
A blunt, and a pretty face
Then I'm straight like a good perm
And her swag so official
Taylor made, money gang
I'm the General
And all my weed strong like Kimbo Slice
The money's the only thing I do twice
I'm in the fast lane, yellow chain, blue lights
And you gon' need shades, they say I'm too bright
I'm shitting on the game, so bring through wipes
And you can clean up and try to beat us
I'm sure you niggas is balling, that's what they all say
But "Me" plus "Getting money" gon' equal "All day"
My seats parkay
Bitch from the Caribbean
She say "Por que"
Wizzle K, H, A

Pewm-pewm
The swag just left the room
And I ain't even pressed
Got you feeling underdressed
Any time you find him in the building, I'm a threat
Got some Gucci Chuck Tay's you ain't seen yet
Yellow Ice, so I may seem fresh
But if you did what I'm doing
Nigga, you'd be feeling spoiled rotten
In my city I got pull
So don't tug, or get drugged
Through the mud probably
Like my weed rolled
My steak done properly
I put my team on
And now we own property
And my swag so official
No magazines, so my cash not a issue
Tell the Ref to throw a flag, blow the whistle
Cause your style's outta date
That's a foul on the play
And your words don't hurt him
Cause I'm flying out the way
What you make a month
I probably spent today

[Verse 1]
Yea, but she always say, but she love my style
And if I stay out late I'm coming home rich
Thinking bout that pussy on the grind got me home sick
Them dollar signs on my mind got me on this
If I don't hustle then what happens in the morning
Do the sun even rise, do the birds sing
When I can stand over the stove and make the birds sing
You think about that I'll be right back, ring
There she go baby call right back click, ring
Then she call right back click, ring
I toss the phone in the back, quick think
Shit you all I got, but if you leave me where you left me than be on that clock
Gettin' it, and when a nigga hittin' it you lovin'
No crying no fussing, just a simple I'm coming
So when you baby boy out there running
Don't cry don't fuss it's simple I'm coming

[Hook]
I know what he does
(I know what he does)
But ohh I'm in love (so in love)
(My baby), that's my baby, have his baby someday
And yes it's hard (so hard, ohhh)
But that's my baby
And I love him, I love him yall

[Verse 2]
Yea, I roll up on her in that earth toner
She can smell the work on me when I work on her
I see through that smurk on her, it hurts sort of
But I been in to deep since my first order
I just tell her don't expect the worst
She say she don't wanna be stuck standing next to a nurse
I say I don't wanna be stuck standing next to a curb
She said she don't wanna, I say shut up you pressing my nerves
She say, who you telling shut up, then she get up
Start packing her shit up, start calling her sister
Sister dosen't pick up, the tension start to pick up
She crying, she got hiccups, I'm tellin her to cheer up
I'm laying down she tell me sit up, I sit up
She push me down I sit up
She push me down I get up
Then I act like ima hit her
But I'm a better nigga
She can't find a better nigga, nah

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I think about you when I'm riding dirty
Said I love you for I left, I hope you heard me
Case I never make it back, I hope you heard me
And if you ever have twins name em bright and early
Cause I'm up for the money I hope you down with it
No this ain't game but I can be found in it
And why be in it if I'm not gon win it
So I be playing til the last minute, you don't get it
See that ground hurt when you hit it, I wouldn't lie baby
But fuck with me and you forever fly baby
So far from the buttom I swear
Smell the work in the air, I'm there
You can never take that from me
And what I been through you can't take back from me
If I offend you then mama get back from me
But if you love then I know you coming back for me, you love my style

[Hook]

[Intro: Sean Biggs]
Wuh!
Yeh, uh

[Verse 1: Sean Biggs & Akon]
I'm from the hard knock academy, automatically had to be
Carryin' automatics, sprayin' sporadic, inaccurate (Wuh)
Clips to the back of it, barrel cockin' immaculate
Learn to move packages in and out of Los Angeles
We savages, bustin' off rounds, sprayin' banana clips
Knockin pounds off 'em like Anna Nicole Smith
Shit, I'm in the hood, walkin' with choppers
Cockin' and poppin' at coppers, Glocks be talkin' like
Blockedie block, block
I probably popped Hoffa and possibly just forgot where I tossed 'em (Huh)
This nigga's obnoxious, me and Top got your bitch in the cockpit
She want a pit stop, just see how the cock spit
These bosses deposit the profit, they watch as we cop it
On top of the ostrich and foxes (That's right)
I used to be a little bastard of stress (Ey)
Now I'mma boss where I'm from (Ey)
With Alaska on my chest (Yes!)

[Chorus: Akon]
See I know you'll like my swagger (Oh)
No strap when I come through (Through)
Chain hangin' like Ali Baba (Oh)
Know me, ya' know how I do (Do)
The way that I move, nigga
(Ya' never gon' get it)
Cause I'm too smooth, nigga
(Ya' never gon' get it)
I thought you knew, nigga
(Ya' never gon' get it)
But you ain't got a clue, nigga
(Ya' never gon' get it, get it, get it)

[Verse 2: Topic & Akon]
Who in the hell left the gate open? (That's wrong)
I put it down for the wild, wild west
Like the 1800s in 'em stage coaches
If I ain't strapped then my blade's pokin'
If it ain't a 600 big body, then the '64, honey, is spokin'
The drama spokesman, streets endorsed 'em (Aha)
I rather be opening up my nine, then closed in my coffin
(I'm from) I'm from West Covina, this ain't Compton
Still money passed around like we takin' a offerin'
I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
When they see the sad happy faces, they know the drama's on
It's the west coast back at your front door (Back)
We up close and personal, we ain't done till the curtains close (Aha)
Could be friend or foe, love it or hate it
I'm the king but I play with the aces (Hahaha)
Run up to find out I keep it loaded like bases (Ey)
Get wise and your mouth and knees (Ey) need braces (Hey!)

[Chorus: Akon]
See I know you'll like my swagger (Oh)
No strap when I come through (Through)
Chain hangin' like Ali Baba (Oh)
Know me, ya' know how I do (Do)
The way that I move, nigga
(Ya' never gon' get it)
Cause I'm too smooth, nigga
(Ya' never gon' get it)
I thought you knew, nigga
(Ya' never gon' get it)
But you ain't got a clue, nigga
(Ya' never gon' get it, get it, get it)

[Verse 3: Akon]
See when I walk through the door
I wonder why these fake niggas jackin' me for?
On display, like I came from the store, you know
I'm posin' like a mannequin in front of your hoe (Wu-uh)
Up front block runnin' 50 deep now (Wu-uh)
Convicts surroundin' the whole compound (Wu-uh)
Cause you don't really want what you're starin' at
Clip full of bullets, don't mind sharin' that (That)

[Chorus: Akon]
See I know you'll like my swagger (Oh)
No strap when I come through (Through)
Chain hangin' like Ali Baba (Oh)
Know me, ya' know how I do (Do)
The way that I move, nigga
(Ya' never gon' get it)
Cause I'm too smooth, nigga
(Ya' never gon' get it)
I thought you knew, nigga
(Ya' never gon' get it)
But you ain't got a clue, nigga
(Ya' never gon' get it, get it, get it)

Tattoos in my V neck

Twenty twelve I'm going in
At golf I'm born to win

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Say, babe, I'm liking what you do to me
So how about you and me, keep it up, keep it up
Hey lady, did you know you were the reason
Never catch me leaving, so keep it up, keep it up

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't give a, what people say
They're going to talk either way
Let's just have fun while we can enjoy ourselves

[Chorus]
Don't wanna give it up, might as well live it up
Don't wanna give it up, might as well live it up
Don't wanna give it up, might as well live it up
Don't wanna give it up, so we might as well live it up

[Verse 2]
Hey babe, and since my new addiction
You got me lifted, so keep me up, keep me up
Hey lady, if you're ever feeling saucy
Tell me when you want me to beat it up, beat it up

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't give a, what people say
They're going to talk either way
Let's just have fun while we can enjoy ourselves

[Chorus]
Don't wanna give it up, might as well live it up
Don't wanna give it up, might as well live it up
Don't wanna give it up, might as well live it up
Don't wanna give it up, so we might as well live it up

[Verse 3]
We don't have to rush it, we can take our time, take our time
But we both know what we want, want, so what's it gonna be?
And no one has to know it but us, but us baby
Just my love, I finally found someone who actually agrees

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't give a, what people say
They're going to talk either way
Let's just have fun while we can enjoy ourselves

[Chorus]
Don't wanna give it up, might as well live it up
Don't wanna give it up, might as well live it up
Don't wanna give it up, might as well live it up
Don't wanna give it up, so we might as well live it up

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach, somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor, again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Go, stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama, help me, I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works
Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why try ignoring him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this!
I've pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this now!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out
I bleed it out
I bleed it out

Hey batter batter hey batter hey batter batter
Hey batter hey batter batter hey batter batter)
SWING!

[Verse 1]
I've got a soul that can not sleep
At night when something just ain't right
Blood red, but without sight
Exploding egos in the night
Mix like sticks of dynamite
Red, black, or white, this is my fight
Come on courage, let's be heard
Turn feelings into words
American equality has always been sour
An attitude I would like to devour
My name is peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power?

[Chorus]
Power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be (Ought to be)
It fills me up like a hollow tree (Hollow tree)
The power of equality

[Verse 2]
Right or wrong, my song is strong
You don't like it, get along
Say what I want, do what I can
Death to the message of the Ku Klux Klan
I don't buy supremacy
A-media chief, you menace me
The people you say cause all the crime
Wake up motherfucker and smell the slime
Blackest anger, whitest fear
Can you hear me, am I clear?
My name is peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power?

[Chorus]
Power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be (Ought to be)
It fills me up like a hollow tree (Hollow tree)
The power of equality

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I've got tapes, I've got CDs
I've got my Public Enemy
My lily white ass is tickled pink
When I listen to the music that makes me think
"Not another motherfuckin' politician
Doin' nothin' but something for his own ambition"
Never touch the sound we make
Soul sacred love, vows that we take
To create straight what is true
Yo, he's with me and what I do
My name is peace, this my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power?

[Chorus]
Power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be (Ought to be)
It fills me up like a hollow tree (Hollow tree)
The power of equality

[Verse 4]
Madder than a motherfucker, lick my finger
Can't forget, 'cause the memory lingers
Count 'em off quick, little Piccadilly sickness
Take me to the hick, oh, eat my thickness
I've got a welt from the Bible belt
A-dealing with the hand that I've been dealt
Sitting in the grip of a killing fist
Giving up blood just to exist
Rub me wrong and I get pissed
No, I can not get to this
People in pain, I do not dig it
Change of brain for Mr. Bigot

[Outro]
Little brother, do you hear me?
Have a heart oh come get near me
Misery is not my friend
But I'll break before I bend
What I see is insanity
Whatever happened to humanity?
Whatever happened to humanity?
Whatever happened to humanity?

[Verse 1]
A wanna be gangster thinkin' he's a wise guy
Rob another bank, he's a sock 'em in the eye guy
Tank head, Mr. Bonnie and Clyde guy
Look him the eye, he's not my kinda guy
Never wanna be confusion proof
Pudding's sweet but too aloof
Orange eye girl with a backslide dew said
Yo, homie, who you talkin' to?
A backed up paddywagon mackin' on a cat's ass
One uppercut to the cold upper middle class
Born to storm on boredom's face
Add a little lust to the funky ass Flea bass
Most in the race just lose their grace
The blackest hole in all of space
Crooked as a hooker, now suck my thumb
Anybody wanna come get some?

[Chorus]
(If you have to ask) You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go
(If you have to ask) You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go

[Verse 2]
Don't ask me why I'm flyin' so high
Mr. Bubble meets superfly in my third eye
Searchin' for a soul-bride, she's my freakette
Soak it up inside, deeper than a secret
Much more than meets the eye
To the funk, I fall into my new ride
My hand, my hand
Magic on the one is a medicine man
Thinkin' of a few taboos that I ought to kill
Dancin' on their face like a stage in Vaudeville
I feel so good can't be understood
Booty of a hoodlum rockin' my red hood

[Chorus]
(If you have to ask) You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go
(If you have to ask) You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers will not be told to go

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
I am a man cut from the know
Rarely do friends come and then go
She was a girl, soft but estranged
We were the two our lives rearranged

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Feeling so good that day
A feeling of love that day

[Chorus]
Twisting and turning, your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
(She meant you no harm)
Think you're so clever, but now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
(He loves no one else)

[Verse 2]
Raised by my dad, girl of the day
He was my man, that was the way
She was the girl left alone
Feeling the need to make me her home

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I don't know what, when, or why
The twilight of love had arrived

[Chorus]
Twisting and turning, your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
(She meant you no harm)
Think you're so clever, but now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
(He loves no one else)

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Twisting and turning, your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl

Think you're so clever, but now you must sever
You're breaking the girl

Of being great is not so good

Can I get a little lovin' from you?

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
And I'm sailin', yeah
Yeah, oh yeah
Yeah... oh yeah
Hit me!

[Verse 1]
Shoulda been, coulda been, woulda been dead
If I didn't get the message goin' to my head
I am what I am
Most motherfuckers don't give a damn
Oh, baby, think you can
Be my girl, I'll be your man
Someone full of fun do me 'til I'm well done
Little Bo Peep cummin' from my stun gun
Beware, take care
Most motherfuckers have a cold ass stare
Oh, baby, please be there
Suck my kiss, cut me my share

[Chorus 1]
Hit me, you can't hurt me, suck my kiss
Kiss me, please pervert me, stick with this
Is she talking dirty?
Give to me sweet sacred bliss, your mouth was made to suck my kiss

[Verse 2]
Look at me, can't you see, all I really want to be
Is free from a world that hurts me
I need relief
Do you want me, girl, to be your thief?
Oh, baby just for you
I'd steal anything that you want me to
K-i-s-s-i-n-g
Chicka chicka dee, do me like a banshee
Low brow is how
Swimming in the sound of bow wow wow
Oh, baby, do me now
Do me here I do allow

[Chorus 2]
Hit me, you can't hurt me, suck my kiss
Kiss me, please pervert me, stick with this
Is she gonna curtsy?
Give to me sweet sacred bliss, that mouth was made to

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
Shoulda been, coulda been, woulda been dead
If I didn't get the message goin' to my head
I am what I am
Most motherfuckers don't give a damn
Oh, baby, think you can
Be my girl, I'll be your man
Someone full of fun do me 'til I'm well done
Little Bo Peep cummin' from my stun gun
Beware, take care
Most motherfuckers have a cold ass stare

Suck my kiss, cut me my share

[Chorus 1]
Hit me, you can't hurt me, suck my kiss
Kiss me, please pervert me, stick with this
Is she talking dirty?
Give to me sweet sacred bliss, that mouth was made to suck my kiss

[Verse 1]
There must be something in the way I feel
That she don't want me to feel
The stare she bares cut me
I don't care, you see, so what if I bleed?
I could never change just what I feel
My face will never show what is not real

[Verse 2]
A mountain never seemed to have the need to speak
A look that shares so many seek
The sweetest feeling I got from you
The things I said to you were true
I could never change just what I feel
My face will never show what is not real

[Chorus]
I could have lied, I'm such a fool
My eyes could never, never, never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
But now she gone, yeah, she gone away
A soulful song that would not stay
You see, she hides 'cause she is scared
But I don't care, I won't be spared

[Chorus]
I could have lied, I'm such a fool
My eyes could never, never, never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

[Chorus]
I could have lied, I'm such a fool
My eyes could never, never, never keep their cool
I showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

[Outro]
Fucked up

[Verse 1]
I've got a mellowship, I've got a fellowship
I've got a nonstop "yo swan" hello chip
Born to adore the big bad bison
Thunderstorm and a man like Tyson
Popcorn peanuts lookin' at big butts
No, I can not keep my mouth shut
Rockin' to the beat of the fabulous Forum
My Lakers I adore 'em
Blush my lady when I tell her
That I do indeed love to smell her
Sopping wet your pink umbrella
Do the dog with Isabella
I'm so in love, yes, with an artist
Imagination, he the smartest
Robert Williams, stroke and splatter
I attest to your gray matter
Living kings how true it rings
These are just a few of my favorite things

[Chorus 1]
Good God, where's my sleigh now
Good God, playing for days now
Good God, well any day now
Good God, take me away now
Good God, purple haze now
Good God, the baddest of brains now
Good God, well any day now
Good God, ridin' my sleigh now

[Verse 2]
Being that I'm the duke of my domain
My hat goes off to Mark Twain
Singing a song about what true men don't do
Killing another creature, that's kind of blue
Writing about the world of the wild coyote
Good man Truman Capote
Talking about my thoughts 'cause they must grow
Cock my brain to shoot my load
I'm on the porch cause I lost my house key
Pick up my book I read Bukowski
Can I get another kiss from you?
Kiss me right here on my tattoo

[Chorus 2]
Good God, where's my sleigh now
Good God, playing for days now
Good God, well any day now
Good God, take me away now
Good God, DeNiro's insane now
Good God, rackin' my brain now
Good God, well any day now
Good God, take me away now
Take me away

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Me my friends and the sex machine
Do unto others like my brother Bean
I know you've got a mother so give her a hug
I know you've got a mother with a whole lot of love
Billy sings and Basie swings
These are just a few of my favorite things
These are just a few of my favorite things
These are just a few of my favorite things
These are just a few of

[Intro: Anthony Kiedis]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
I can't rest in war, will you be my friend?
Dark Ages never change, well I can't comprehend
Kiss me we self destruct, can you hear me, Lord?
Yes, I think we're fucked, but I can't rest in war

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Righteous and the wicked of the war and peace
The righteous and the wicked, war and peace
The killing fist of the human beast

Hear me when I'm calling you from my knees

Praying for a better day anyway, oh yeah
Ahn, praying for a better day, oh yeah

Holy mother earth crying into space
Tears on her pretty face for she has been raped
Killing your future blood, fill her with disease
Global abortion, please, that is what she needs

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Righteous and the wicked of the war and peace
The righteous and the wicked, war and peace
The killing fist of the human beast

Are we fireflies flashing in the night?
Big thunder rumble fish, did you get it right?
Headstrong battle song, exploding souls be gone
Marvin Gaye my love, where did we go wrong?

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Righteous and the wicked of the war and peace
The righteous and the wicked, war and peace
The killing fist of the human beast

Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
What I got, you got to give it to your mamma
What I got, you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got, you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got, you got to get it put it in you
What I got, you got to get it put it in you
What I got, you got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop, continue
I realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with Sly, you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser?

[Chorus]
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

[Verse 2]
Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free, love me, say, "Hell, yes"
Low brow but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now
Bob Marley, poet and a prophet
Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Bob Marley walkin' like he talk it
Goodness me, can't you see I'm gonna cough it?

[Chorus]
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Oh, oh yeah
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

[Backwards Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Lucky me swimming in my ability
Dancing down on life with agility
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility
My mom, I love her 'cause she love me
Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feelin' good, my brother gonna hug me
Drinkin' my juice, young love chug-a-lug me
Ah, there's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is a never gonna wither
Come on, everybody, time to deliver

[Chorus]
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper

[Verse 1]
What I got you got to give it to your mamma
What I got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
What I got you got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop, continue
I realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with Sly, you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser?

[Verse 1]
Blood sugar sucker fish in my dish
How many pieces do you wish
Step into a heaven where I keep it on the soul side
Girl, please me, be my soul bride
Every woman has a piece of Aphrodite
Copulate to create a state of sexual light
Kissing her virginity, my affinity
I mingle with the gods, I mingle with divinity

[Chorus]
Blood sugar baby, she magik
Sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar baby, she magik
Sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar crazy, she has it
Sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar baby, she magik
Sex magik, sex magik

[Verse 2]
Glorious euphoria is my must
Erotic shock is a function of lust
Temporarily blind, dimension to discover
In time, each into the other
Uncontrollable notes from her snow-white throat
Fill a space in which two bodies float
Operatic by voice, a fanatic by choice
Aromatic is the flower, she must be moist

[Chorus]
Blood sugar baby, she magik
Sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar baby, she magik
Sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar crazy, she has it
Sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar baby, she magik
Sex magik, sex magik

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Blood sugar baby, she magik
Sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar baby, she magik
Sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar crazy, she has it
Sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar baby, she magik
Sex magik, sex magik

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Blood sugar baby, she magik
Sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar baby, she magik
Sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar crazy, she has it
Sex magik, sex magik
Blood sugar baby, she magik
Sex magik, sex magik

[Verse 1]
Standing on the corner of civilization
There's a time, there's a place for me
In a world where I can't be found
Cold and mean, people give me the creeps
Going to the jungle where the elephant roams
Got to get away, going to make it my home
Losing my taste for the human race
Social grace is a waste of time
It's absurd when I look around
So sublime that we blow my mind
Naked in the rain with a killer whale
I can taste the salt when I lick his tail

[Chorus]
(Naked in the rain) Doctor Doolittle, what's your secret?
Give it to me, doctor, don't keep it

[Verse 2]
I never met an animal that I didn't like
You can come to me, I won't bite
Don't you know dog is man's best friend
There is some love that you can't fight
Naked in the rain with the black tattoos
Running through the woods and laughing at the blues

[Chorus]
(Naked in the rain) Doctor Doolittle, what's your secret?
Give it to me, doctor, don't keep it

[Bass Solo]

[Verse 3]
Listen to the talking heart in my chest
With this gift, good Lord, I am blessed
There's a lump and it's in my throat
I'm in love with the wilderness
Naked in the river skinny-dipping my way
In the waterfall, I just want to play

[Chorus]
(Naked in the rain) Doctor Doolittle, what's your secret?
Give it to me, doctor, don't keep it
(Naked in the rain) Doctor Doolittle, what's your secret?
Give it to me, doctor, don't keep it

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
Sittin' on a sack of beans
Sittin' down in New Orleans
You wouldn't believe what I've seen
Sitting on that sack of beans
Lunatics on pogo sticks
Another southern fried freak on a crucifix
Hicks don't mix with politics
People on the street just kickin' to the licks

[Chorus 1]
Yes, my favorite place to be
Is not a land called Honalee
Oh, mentally or physically
I wanna be in New Orleans

[Verse 2]
Oh good brother, just when I thought
That I had seen it all
My eyes popped out, my dick got hard
And I dropped my jaw
I saw a bird walkin' down the block
Name Apache Rose Peacock
I could not speak I was in shock
I told my knees to please not knock

[Chorus 1]
Yes, my favorite place to be
Is not a land called Honalee
Oh, mentally or physically
I wanna be in New Orleans

[Post-Chorus]
Doo-ru, doo-ru, doo
Doo-ru, doo-ru, doo, doo
Doo-ru, doo-ru, doo
Doo-ru, doo-ru, doo, doo

[Verse 3]
A little boy came along
Name of Louis Armstrong
Said that girl who left me silly
She liked the looks of me and my willy
So I found her in the quarter
Good God, how I adored her
Oh she made me feel so cozy
When she told me I could call her Rosey

[Chorus 2]
I kiss your hair your skin so bare
I'll take you with me, girl, anywhere
You fare well in stormy weather
I never met a girl that I liked better

[Verse 4]
Twinkle twinkle little star
Shining down on my blue car
Drivin' down the boulevard
She was soft and I was hard
Apache Rose gotta rockin' Peacock
Hottest ass on the goddamn block
Rockin' to the beat of the funky ass Meters
She has one of those built-in heaters

[Chorus 2]
I kiss your hair your skin so bare
I'll take you with me, girl, anywhere
You fare well in stormy weather
I never met a girl that I liked better

[Post-Chorus]
Doo-ru, doo-ru, doo
Doo-ru, doo-ru, doo, doo
Doo-ru, doo-ru, doo
Doo-ru, doo-ru, doo, doo

[Verse 5]
Voodoo gurus casting their spells
Cockatoo drag queens shakin' their bells
Silver sound escapes the trumpet
Watch your leg someone might hump it
Chicken strut your butt let's rock
Gettin' it on under your frock
Flowing like a flame all through the night
My girl's insane but it's all right

[Chorus 1]
Yes, my favorite place to be
Is not a land called Honalee
Oh, mentally or physically
I wanna be in New Orleans

[Verse 1]
Drivin' around, I've got my baby and my top down
Mary-go-round I ride you for my love
Throwin' me down in the backseat underground
I'm on the mound I make it for my love

[Verse 2]
Makin' my way, I break another L.A. day
Time in the town I need it for my love
My Chevrolet rollin' to another play day
This is the sound I listen for my love

[Pre-Chorus]
Who (who) you talking to (you talking to)?
Talk to me, you (talk to me, you)
Sound of music
Who (who) you talking to (you talking to)?
Talk to me, you (talk to me, you)
Sound of music

[Chorus]
I love you, swim through me
Good feelings, come to me

[Verse 3]
Sought and I found a life of making my blood-sound
Do anything for the one I love
Something profound, the face of God is in Sensurround
I'm on the mound, I make it for my love

[Pre-Chorus]
Who (who) you talking to (you talking to)?
Talk to me, you (talk to me, you)
Sound of music
Who (who) you talking to (you talking to)?
Talk to me, you (talk to me, you)
Sound of music

[Chorus]
I love you, swim through me
Good feelings, come to me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I love you, swim through me
Good feelings, come to me
I love you, swim through me
Good feelings, come to me

[Verse 1]
I used to shout across the room to you
And you'd come dancin' like a fool
Aw, shuffle step, you funky mother
Come to me, all warm as covers
Rest with me, my lovely brother
For you see, there is no other
Memory so sad and sweet
I'll see you soon, save me a seat

[Chorus 1]
Oh, well, I'm cryin', now my lovely man
Oh, yes, I'm cryin', now and no one can
Will ever fill the, the hole you left, my man
I'll see you later, my lovely man, if I can

[Verse 2]
In my room, I'm all alone
Yeah, waitin' for ya to get home
I listen to Roberta Flack
But I know you won't come back

[Chorus 2]
Oh well, I'm cryin', now my lovely man
I'll see you later, my lovely man, if I can

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Just in case you never knew
I miss you, Slim, I love you too
See my heart, it's black and blue
When I die, I will find you

[Chorus 3]
Oh, well, I'm cryin', now my lovely man
Oh, yes, I'm cryin', now and no one can
Will ever fill the, the hole you left, my man
I'll see you later, my lovely man, if I can

[Outro]
Well, I'm cryin', lovely man, yeah, oh-oh
Well, I'm cryin', yeah, there now, oh, a-love, man
Oh, I miss you, ben adam, I love you, man
I'll see you later, my lovely man
We had some good time, my lovely man
Yeah
Bo-bo-bo

[Verse 1]
A long, long, long, long time ago
Before the wind, before the snow
Lived a man, lived a man I know
Lived a freak of nature named Sir Psycho
“Sir Psycho Sexy, that is me!
Sometimes I find I need to scream”

[Refrain]
He's a freak of nature, but we love him so
He's a freak of nature, but we let him go

[Verse 2]
Deep inside the garden of Eden
Standing there with my hard on bleedin'
There's a devil in my dick and some demons in my semen
Good God no, that would be treason
Believe me, Eve, she gave good reason
Booty looking too good not to be squeezin'
Creamy beaver hotter than a fever
I'm a givin' cause she's the receiver
I won't and I don't hang up until I please her
Makin' her feel like an over achiever
I take it away for a minute just to tease her
Then I give it back a little bit deeper

[Chorus]
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah (He's the man that I met one time)
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah (He's the man that left me blind)
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah (He's the man, he's the man, he's the man)
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah (Yeah)

[Refrain]
He's a freak of nature, but we love him so
He's a freak of nature, but we let him go

[Verse 3]
I got stopped by a lady cop in my automobile
She said get out and spread your legs
And then she tried to cop a feel
That cop she was all dressed in blue
Was she pretty? Boy I'm tellin' you
She stuck my butt with her big black stick
I said "What's up? Now suck my dick"
Like a ram getting ready to jam the lamb
She whimpered just a little when she felt my hand
On her crotch, so very warm
I could feel her getting wet through her uniform
Proppin' her up on the black and white
Unzipped and slipped, "Ooh, that's tight"
I swatted her like no swat team can
Turned a cherry pie right into jam

[Chorus]
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah (I'm the man that you met one time)
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah (I'm the man that'll leave you blind)
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah (I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man)
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah

[Verse 4]
Hello young woman that I love
Pretty punk rock mamma that I'm thinking of
Hold me naked if you will
In your arms, in your legs, in your pussy, I'd kill
To be with you, to kiss with you, I do miss you
I love you

[Bridge]
Lay me down, lay me down, lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down, lay me down, lay me down
Descending waves of graceful pleasure
For your love, there is no measure
Her curves they bend with subtle splendor

[Verse 5]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the funk will make me freak
If I should die before I waked
Allow me Lord to rock out naked
Bored by the ordinary time to take a trip
Calling up a little girl with a bull whip
Lickety split go snap "snap"
Girl gettin' off all in my lap
The tallest tree the sweetest sap
Blowin' my ass right off the map
Ooh and it's nice out here
I think I'll stay for a while

[Instrumental Outro]

[Chorus]
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes, she got them for sale
Hot tamales and they're red not, yes, she got them for sale

[Verse 1]
I got a girl, says she long and tall
She sleeps in the kitchen with her feet in the hall

[Chorus]
Hot tamales and they red hot, yes, she got 'em for sale, I mean
Yes she got 'em for sale, yeah
Hot tamales and they red hot, yes, she got 'em for sale (They too hot, boy)
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes, she got them for sale
Hot tamales and they're red not, yes, she got them for sale

[Verse 2]
You know the monkey, now the baboon's playing in the grass
Well, the monkey stuck his finger in that old "Good Gulf Gas," now

[Chorus]
Hot tamales because they're red hot, yes, they got them for sale, I mean
Yes, she got them for sale, yeah
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes, she got them for sale
Hot tamales and they're red not, yes, she got them for sale

[Verse 3]
She got two for a nickel, got four for a dime
Would sell you more, but they aren't mine

[Chorus]
Hot tamales and they red hot, yes, she got 'em for sale, I mean
Yes, she got 'em for sale, yes, yeah
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes, she got them for sale
Hot tamales and they're red not, yes, she got them for sale

[Outro]

Hot tamales because they're red hot, yes, they got them for sale, I mean
Yes, she got them for sale, yeah

[Intro: Shogun, Pharrell & (DJ Drama)]
Choose the sword, and you join me
Choose the ball, and you join your mother...in death
You don't understand my words, but you must choose
So...come boy, choose life or death
Serious? You can't be serious
(I think so)
You niggas can't be serious (I think so)
(This is what they wanted)

[Verse 1]
Tuff guy nada, but it spots shit Ohada
Finish with the spinach Like the little nigga Popeye
Scarf by Escada, boots by Prada
Hermes bag and rag and sex with Yada Yanna
Liberace chains, hold my neck like an anchor
Love to my fans, you bought it so I thank ya
If you're a hater then I'm glad that I ain't ya
Couldn't see the light like baby Jesus in a manger
We wanted this life we salivated like wolves
Blow a hundred grand on L.V. leather goods
Lift up the doors, open trunk, open hood
Enzo horse power, crank it up and hear the hooves
My notebook was my hustle and flow stash
Young and ludicrous, my life had just crashed
Oooh had a chilly chilly past
Look at the Ice Cream symbol that's why the nigga laugh

[Verse 2]
I'm all about angels so I try to do that
But I only ended up with burning stubs on my back
So with that said lil' Skateboard's back
On the corner doubling down bricks to sell that track
Trying to drive that dress LR
Or laid back in back of that laid back
You know puffing on a Cuban cigar
In Brazil with Hype Williams watching the play back
This is living got to watch out for the driven
They'll kidnap your understanding and stab up your wisdom
One hit of that boy, boy, them niggas is schizing
Hog tie the family and blood bath the kitchen
This is a recipe to make niggas hate you
Face on the Newsweek the actress want to date you
Icecream boutique the Icecream skate shoe
Twelve pages in the women's American Vogue
Chanel ceramic watches just share with your hoes
Goyard trunks to travel there with your clothes
The engine just hums to send in the air and it goes
Lisa's in the lavatory she's puffing kush
Sara's on my lap with her head humming push
Shrimp and French fries right before I land
You take the ketchup and tell me where I am
Green Lantern it's your motherfucking man
Skateboard yessir

[Intro: Fuzzy Jones]
Well, it is a weepin' and a moanin' and a gnashin' of teeth

Roll–roll–roll my weed on it: that's an ass tray
Say, Ye, say, Ye, don't we do this every day–day? (Huh?)

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Yuugh! It's prime time, my top back, this pimp game, ho
I'm red leather, this cocaine, I'm Rick James, ho
I'm bill-droppin', Ms. Pac-Man, this pill-poppin' ass ho
I'm poppin' too, these blue dolphins need two coffins
All she want is some heel money
All she need is some bill money
He take his time, he counts it out
I weighs it up, that's real money
Check the neck, check the wrist
Them heads turnin': that's exorcist
My Audemars like Mardi Gras
That's Swiss time, and that's excellence
Two-door preference
Roof gone, George Jefferson
That white frost on that pound cake
So your Duncan Hines is irrelevant, woo
Lambo Murciélago
She go wherever I go
Wherever we go, we do it pronto, it's like—

[Verse 3: Kanye West & 2 Chainz]
Let the suicide doors up
I threw suicides on the tour bus
I threw suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in Def Jam buildin' like I'm the shit
Tell 'em gimme fifty million or I'ma quit
Most rappers' taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-yo-face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press, kid
Plus, yo, my bitch make your bitch look like Precious
Somethin' 'bout Mary, she gone off that molly
Now the whole party is melting like Dalí
Now everybody is movin' they body
Don't sell me apartment, I'll move in the lobby (Yah)
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important
You gon' see lawyers and niggas in Jordans (2 Chainz)

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz & Big Sean]
Okay, now catch up to my campaign
Coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time
Drinkin' champagne on the airplane (Tell 'em)
Spit rounds like a gun range (Baow)
Beat it up like Rampage
Hundred bands, cut your girl
Now your girl need a Band-Aid (Damn)
Grade A, A1
Chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds, backpack rhymin'
Co-signed by Louis Vuitton (Yep)
Horsepower, horsepower
All this Polo on, I got horsepower
Pound of this cost four thousand
Now I make it rain, she want more showers
Rain (Rain) pourin' (Pourin')
All my cars is foreign (Foreign)
All my broads is foreign (Foreign)
Money tall like Jordan

[Verse 1]
Thank God it's Friday
Got my paycheck and I'm going home
Leaving my job, on the highway, turn up my stereo
Because last weekend sucked
But this one's gonna be different
Because it's fucking Friday, I'm getting drunk and we gonna kick it
Then my friend's like, "Hey man, what's going on?" ("I don't know")
We all know though that we're gonna get drunk at the club
Get it crunk to the same shit we did the week before
Meet at the store
Free funking in my house
In high school it was drinking games
Bad house parties in Ike's house
But now we go on the town
We gotta hit the club
We gotta spend them bucks
And we gotta get it crunk
Seven for a drink and fifteen cash at the entrance
And thank heavens Wells Fargo's got overdraft protection
We walked up in
Yes, they're spinning R.Kelly's remix to the remix about a chick and skeeted on her belly
The females (woop, woop) they're done and there're plenty
I got two dollars... ah, charge it, bartender a round of Henny!

[Hook]
We're going to the club, club
Pour me another one, gotta get numb, numb
Hopefully end up with a girl I can fuck, fuck
Oops, baby you know that I meant love, love
Who's coming with me back to my tub, tub?
"Now, Macklemore, you know you ain't got no hot tub, man," tub, tub
Shut up man, she don't know us, us
Everybody toast your glasses, tonight's the best night ever
Now who's getting hammered?

[Verse 2]
I'm on the wall drunk as fuck
Like this sucks, I'm hella bored
Decided to cut the rug with a female, like stellar on the floor
Break her off her stiletto, sore
Thought she was Puerto Rican, started talking
I'm like, "Woops, it's a honky, she's just hella orange"
My homie's like, "Mack, what you tell her for? She was feeling you"
"Dawg, I could peel her foo, this is Washington not Florida"
The white girls are looking for some big black dick
The black girls are all, "Yeah he's cute for a white guy, but that's about it"
Asians kicking with Asians
And the Latinos are too beautiful
Wish I could confidently be like, "Girl you don't know what I could do to you"
Get her back to the pad and probably bust in my pants
She'd be like, "Ooh, ah, pappy," I'd be like... sorry
Think I'mma buy you a drink? Better find you a shrink
("I'm rich bitch, psych")
I sling CDs and grind tapes, bet your boyfriend can't spit
Get the clit to vibrate
I should have stayed home, I get more chicks on MySpace

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
There's that sweaty girl (sweaty girl)
In the corner on e-bomb
Thinking she's in a Missy video but really looks like a retard
And there's the wall muggers (wall muggers)
That shout just to seem hard
And there's the ball suckers (ball suckers)
That fight and just seem odd
I spent seventy-five dollars and these drinks don't work
Who the hell's this ugly, taint skank?
Why are my friends in pink shirts?
My hat's too big
My air-force's were clean when I came here
Now they're stained in beer
And who peed on my white tee?
I thought this was the spot, I was supposed to get jocked
There's a dude talking on chickens and they're clucking for cocks
Funny thing is, we're all insecure
That's why we call the bartender and tell him to give us a beer
Until our judgement is blurred and little voices slush and they slur
We getting faded, waking up hungover and going to work
Do it every weekend, this is the life
You better peep it
And it ain't no secret the club sucks, but do we go?
Better believe it!

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I been a menace to society
Since when? since Menace 2 Society
Still refused to become a legitimate citizen quietly
Felt like my label hidin' me
But here I am anyway I might be back to slangin' grams any day
And if this record flop well I'll be back wit' a bomb of hard
Wit' C-Rod and the squad this whole industry's a façade
Man this ain't real life
Half these rappers don't know what sacrifice feel like
Man these niggas is all hype
Not even rappin' on real mics
They just get high and say whatever the fuck they feel like
They make me feel like bustin' these niggas one at a time
And I'm still outbustin' these niggas, ho pick a rhyme

[Hook]
Ay, what these other niggas talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king cause I said it and I mean that shit
Ay, what's so special 'bout him ay, he ain't all that shit
I set the city on fire and you seen that shit?
Ay, what these other niggas talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king cause I said it and I mean that shit
Ay, what's so special 'bout him ay, he ain't all that shit
I set the city on fire and you seen that shit

[Verse 2]
It's only five rappers outta Atlanta who bustin' and I'm one of 'em
The other four, you know who you are
But if you gotta think twice, well, shawty, you ain't nice
Regardless of your publishing deal you can't write
I'm the best thing left blowin' breath on the mic
The king of the south; nothin' less will suffice
You wanna bet? Well put yo' budget up
Match the price me and you like putting matches to ice
You won't make it
Before I had a deal I was still butt naked
God signed this, like keeping the Lord's promise
The truth nigga like Beanie's first LP
You can do a song with N'SYNC and couldn't outsell me
I'm a legend in my own time, a prophet in my own rhymes
A king wit' a concubine

[Hook]
Ay, what these other niggas talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king cause I said it and I mean that shit
Ay, what's so special 'bout him ay, he ain't all that shit
I set the city on fire and you seen that shit?
Ay, what these other niggas talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king cause I said it and I mean that shit
Ay, what's so special 'bout him ay, he ain't all that shit
I set the city on fire and you seen that shit

[Verse 3]
Niggas like you a dime a dozen they come and go
So why I'm runnin' now and I ain't never run before
Grab choppers, cock 'em and blow
Stoppin' the show bet or owe 'em, droppin' the hoes
You just keep watchin' the door
Pop 'em, watch 'em drop to the floor fluff his pockets and go
Put a quarter block on his nose and a Glock in his clothes
He can keep his watches and gold for his momma to hold
She'll be there buyin' the hoes before the drama unfolds
They know shawty outta control got me hot as a stove
Puttin' holes in yo' Girbaud wettin' up yo' Polos
44's and Callico's a black and a chrome
Lettin' loose and splackin' your dome
Hoppin' back in the Brougham
Known for kickin' in yo' door wavin' gats in yo' home
Clearin' it out I'm sorry I ain't hearin' you out
You hearin' about the squad pumping fear in your heart
Because you know sacrifice was near and dear to your heart

[Hook]
Ay, what these other niggas talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king cause I said it and I mean that shit
Ay, what's so special 'bout him ay, he ain't all that shit
I set the city on fire and you seen that shit?
Ay, what these other niggas talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king cause I said it and I mean that shit
Ay, what's so special 'bout him ay, he ain't all that shit
I set the city on fire and you seen that shit

[Outro]
Ay, my niggas y'all already know what it is
T-I-P, Grand Hustle, Pimp Squad for life nigga
Sanchez on the beat, dig this man
I'mma keep it always pimpin' I'm stayin' down
Y'all niggas gone send yo' demos in
Get cha little motherfuckin' deal
Go sell records
Nigga I got houses, I got blow, I got dro
Nigga I got hoes, nigga I got property nigga
What you wanna do nigga?
Fuck y'all niggas
Come see about me if you don't like it
King of da goddamn south
Rubberband man in this bitch
Uh, oh, uh, oh
YEAA!

[Verse 1]
Her eyes were green, her skin glistened
Talk all you want to, she never listens
She'll love for an instant but how quickly she forgets
And as she drove away
She was listening to Bennie and the Jets
To Bennie and the Jets

[Verse 2]
She'll walk by your window, you'll only catch a glimpse
She'll disappear like vapor, and leave a trail of hints
But all you'll really capture is that feeling in your chest
And as she drove away
She was listening to Bennie and the Jets
To Bennie and the Jets

[Verse 3]
She's the Poet's nightmare, she'll sink into your soul
She'll absorb your passion and turn it into coal
Well, I ain't no poet but I'll try like all the rest
I remember as she drove away
She was listening to Bennie and the Jets
To Benny and the Jets

[Chorus]
Can you keep a secret
From them other people
If I tell you 'bout wha-gwan?

'Cause bingo, now I'm hitting the six
'Cause bingo, now I'm hitting the six

Yeah, I know what's going on

That's why I don't run
For the sake of havin' fun

Can you keep a secret
From them other people
If I tell you 'bout wha-gwan?

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Go! If it’s a coke drought, then why's your wifey coked out?
Butt-naked, snortin’ lines in the dope house
I’m too far, smoking cigars in the dining room
Got birds everywhere, that’s why it’s called the dining room
300 pounds wrapped tight, I need every room
And move the clothes, I put the money in the closet, fool
I'm not a handyman, but Gucci keeps a lot of tools
I teach niggas how to cut it, like it’s barber's school
Wait a minute, just be patient, I may take a minute
I’m in a dark and tinted Mercedes, it cost a pretty penny
I’m in the kitchen and I’m water-whippin
I hit it for the freak, ‘cause homey bought a half a chicken

[Hook:]
Got 6 goons countin’ money in the living room
Got birds everywhere, I call it the chicken room
And I'm about to move my bed into my kitchen soon
Got birds everywhere, I call it the chicken room
Got 6 goons countin’ money in the living room
Got birds everywhere, I call it the chicken room
And I'm about to move my bed into my kitchen soon
Got birds everywhere, I call it the chicken room

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I'm in my Phantom with my madam and a fat blunt
I dump the ashes in an empty cup of grape fruitpunch
I'm having fun, prima donna
Sellin’ pills and chron’
I need it by the ton
I want it wit a grape one
Me and Rock from the block, that’s a great bond
I'm in the Zone 6, I'm coolin' with my black gun
True religion, .50 is my true religion
And there ain’t no robbin’ me
.50 in my robbin’ jeans
Ain't no "I" in team
You want 1017
You know my regime
Got money, all means
I bring it to you clean, I bring it to you raw
I got a 100 things, I'm tryin’ to numb your jaw

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Rocko]
Hey, R-O-C the Don, I'm flyer than an owl
Who that say they got new falcons? I’m passing out right now
I quote my mouth when I talk. These niggas scary
Repeat whatever they hear, these niggas parrots
Eyes of despair, I can’t spare it
Has to get my coach
That’s why I ?rode the vultures
D.E.E
I’m a pescetarian, I don’t eat beef
Go google that word
My favorite food is birds
They tryin’ to get the formula
But I’m on to them
They know I got them 5 birds, and they wantin’ them
The Pontiacs, where the fuck I'mma put this money at?
Look, now I got 30 from ?sealings this year, 100 mill

[Hook:]

[Verse 1]
Intimate scenes, fresh from my dreams
Of a triple X movie scene
I could care less about being seen
A higher self-esteem with you and me
(Ain't that the way it's supposed to be?)
I say baby, do you think?
Sugar so sweet, should'a rot my teeth
Instead it just rottens me, yeah, spoiled crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
Public display of affection
(Got 'em hatin')
Pointin' in our direction
(Watch 'em, watch 'em)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way

[Chorus]
We be at the club, the restaurant
The grocery store or the movie
Kissing and touching
With my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)
Your PDA-A-A
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)

[Verse 2]
Remember at the beach, we brought the sheets
And we were harassed by police?
Good thing we didn't go too deep
Everywhere we be, the passion in me just screams
I just need you in my reach
Baby your suspense can be intense
It's got me convinced, oh yeah
You're the fingers to my instrument

[Pre-Chorus]
Public display of affection
(Got 'em hatin')
Pointin' in our direction
(Watch 'em, watch 'em)
Public display of affection
Make them wish they had it this way

[Chorus]
We be at the club, the restaurant
The grocery store or the movie
Kissing and touching
With my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)
Your PDA-A-A
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)
Your PDA-A-A

[Bridge]
From the lobby to the patio
(Boy you so crazy)
And we so compatible
From the Starbucks to the Navajo
(Hmm, you nasty)
And we so compatible-patible

[Chorus]
We be at the club, the restaurant
The grocery store or the movie
Kissing and touching
With my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)
Your PDA-A-A (I love it, I love it)
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)

Wasn't always a rich bitch
Used to be a poor girl
(Ag, shame, die arme meisie)
Ek wassie wysie (yo yo yo Yo-Landi)
I was a victim of a kak situation
Stuck in the system
With no fokken assistance
I know it sounds strange
But I used to count change
On the counter at pick 'n pay

No butter on my broodjie
Geen koeldrank nie, net my strootjie
But then I got my game on
Yo flame on (yo yo yo Yo-Landi)

Bouncing on the bands she like I'm fuckin' hitting switches
Gold presidential for the gold digging bitches
Bouncing on the bands she like I'm fuckin' hitting switches

[Verse 1]
I pull up like what the business
Fuck you niggas feelings
Puffing dro and paper stacking money to the ceiling
I been balling for a year or two
I don't think I'm going back
Walk up in the club
And make them bitches have a ho attack
Or should I say a heart attacking go into cardiac
I'm gon' let her ride but she ain't fucking then she walking back
You niggas be talking that
Same shit I'm living though
Faded like I'm Michael Jordan
But I'm Scottie Pippen though
Different state
Different place
End up with a different ho
Niggas hating in the hood
I ain't even tripping though
I be walking through my city like a fucking king
I'm in these streets
Just ask around I do my fucking thing
Yeah I been eating since they let me out the fucking bin
Nobody told me this the shit that all this money bring

[Chorus]
You know the team, it's MMG
Rookie of the year, I'm MVP

She asked me who I think I am, I told her bitch I'm me

I tell her bitch I'm me, bitch I'm me
My niggas is balling, you niggas is hating
Cameras everywhere I go, a movie in the making

[Verse 2]
I get that work out my face

I put them b's on your team
And they gon' murder your man
Black and white maro looking like the hamburglar
Damn I got bars
Outer space I'm on mars
I forever do my thing
Pull strings, guitar
Before I had a deal I was a fuckin hood star
And I ain't chewing cause my goon is riding like a good car
I'm the topic of discussion
Waka bitch I'm bustin
Rollie face blue
Like I'm cripping on em cousin
Nigga you ain't got it you just looking like you stunting
I was there, you called my man and you was looking for an onion, lame
We on the same road but it's a different lane
And all you niggas telling like it's a different game
In the district, pointing pictures, giving names
They shoot at us, we kill em all and we get the blame
You know the team, it's MMG
Rookie of the year, I'm MVP

She asked me who I think I am, I told her bitch I'm me

Girl when I met you
The numbers were runnin' through my head
I coulda wrote down your number
But I memorized them instead, ooh
And on the first date, remember the minutes spent together
You called me Rainman, then kissed me for three seconds
Ooh, no one else has ever fit the equation quite like you

[Hook]
White picket fence and house to make love
Two kids and a dog named Doug
Thanksgiving dinner, snow fast in the winter
Keys to the truck, crib and the car
Add the life that we live for us
Get rid of the life that we live for us
Multiply by trust, divide by trust
It equals love, equals love
You're part of the math, you're part of the math
You're part of the math, you're part of it all
You're part of the math, you're part of the math
The math, the math, the math, the math

[Verse 2]
You see, if colors were numbers, you'd be a fuchsia seven
And I'd be a platinum three, and we could be a ten together
Oh, and I don't ever want to part, subtraction or division
And if you ever left
I'd go full calculus to get you back, back, back
Geometry, you're math
Cause the fact is, no one else quite fit the equation like that

[Hook]
White picket fence and house to make love

You're part of the math, you're part of the math
You're part of the math, you're part of it all
You're part of the math, you're part of the math
The math, the math, the math, the math

Baby me and you only equals love (It equals love, it equals love)
If one means one then it just ain't two
And it can't be love cause it's only one

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
OK, I'm smoking loudly, I woke them all
I pick up that tree, ha, when it's not fall
I'm gone off that tree (Tree) when it's not tall
I'm in love with tree, I'm a Avatar
I pick up a O from my nigga Ralphy
My bro and me, but he is not Alfie (Ha)
Gone off that goo-punch, it makes me drowsy (Damn)
Roll up the windows, it makes it cloudy
Damn, if you ain't know
I made these girls' nights, smoking paper and bowls (Look)
My ladies like blunts—hit 'em twice, if not once (Once)
Then I blow 'em off and just pass 'em to my bro
Now, catch me getting brain if a nigga not learning (Ha)
I be spending money if a nigga not earning (Yup)
Catch me in the backseat if I'm not steering (Do it)
And I be rolling up if a nigga not burning, boy

[Chorus: Michael Marshall]
I got five on it (Got it, good)
Grab your 40, let's get keyed
I got five on it
Messing with that Indo weed
I got five on it (Got it, good)
It's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it
Partner, let's go half on a sack

[Verse 2: King Chip]
Yeah, you know a nigga like to stay at that cruising altitude up in the sky
Try to fuck with paper planes, but it's not the same high
Cleveland niggas ain't no bitches, we prefer the cigarillo smoke
If you say it take away from taste, then get some better smoke
'Cause this shit I blow can be smelt on the next block
Ain't no middlemans—everything you need is in stock
This Glock is all the security I need
I be solo-dolo when you see me blowing on some weed
Why speed? No need, I be just taking it slow
I be so clean, diesel overpowers my cologne
Now, all the bad bitches who blazed on shifting this way
Y'all just some white belts with these leaves; I am the sensai
Now, bow to the bag, never save the best for last
When I come around, niggas know to hurry up and pass
Fuck a dime sack, let's cop a quarter-pound now
What the fuck is you gon' put down? Nigga, I got five

[Chorus: Michael Marshall & Curren$y]
I got five on it (Got it, good)
Grab your 40, let's get keyed
I got five on it
Messing with that Indo weed
I got five on it (Got it, good)
It's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it (Ugh)
Partner, let's go half on a sack

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Yeah, hot-wired, six-four hydraulics
Not stolen, lost my keys, I was high, partner
Fuck you want? This the raw paper not a blunt
You must, got me mixed up with Chip 'cause
This Spitta; Zig-Zag a whole zip up
Shit strong, should've came with a bed pickup
Bitches calling me, wanna smoke, beggin' for me to pick up
She blow me while I'm blowin' rings of that killer
That weed you smoking brown
Fake weed, too much makeup, clown
Get real smoking green, strawberry fields
High, standing up, feeling like I'm laying down
Couple boujee Judy's came 'round
Acting all stuck-up; now, they just stuck from smokin' with us
How the hallway smelling? My windows open enough?
I hear walkie-talkies—is security coming up? Fuck

[Chorus: Michael Marshall & Curren$y]
I got five on it (Got it, good)
Grab your 40, let's get keyed (Yeah)
I got five on it
Messing with that Indo weed
I got five on it (Got it, good)
It's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it
Partner, let's go half on a sack

[Verse]
Okay
Victory I envision, so my mission is to win
One look at my arm, she like "Wizzle, where your skin?"
Hatin' niggas talk, hear their whispers in the wind
But I don't wanna do 'em harm, so I kill 'em with my pen
Nicky Santoro, money don't bend
Root of all evil, guess my bank is full of sin
Couldn't be a suit and tie, tired of barely paying rent
Told them fuckers I'm doing numbers, so take it on the chin
Metabolism quick, so it's hard to see what I'm eatin'
Going on retreats and rollin' sweets while I'm tweetin'
Paradise for a weekend, then I'm back in the trap
Never dealt with any drugs, still the Task's on my back
Money on my mind, everything's strapped
You kiddin' and playin', I teach a class how to act
Somebody tell Youtube I prolly need a plaque
Couple hundred thousand views, and I did that on my Mac
'09's mine, '08 was great
They honored Kanye and paid Lil Wayne
Gucci did a bid, but came home and got straight
And every nigga in the biz did a song with T-Pain
No front page, but for those who did
I send 'em my best wishes, the industry's a bitch
That's why I'm on my shit, new luggage and a flip
Shooting movies all my life, no script, no script

[Intro: Macklemore]
Now they say, "Don't forget where you come from
Don't die holding on to your words
Cause you know, that you got a whole world to change
But understand who you gotta change first"

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
And I was like "Fuck that", humility bust back
I remember the days with nothing but a bus pass
I was just a little shorty, just hopin' that I could find a bum
To buy a 40 for me and have enough for a bud sack
Yeah, and I dance on that instrumental
Unorthodox like Basquiat with the pencil
Give me a microphone and a beat box I could vent to
Music the only medium that I could find myself through
Recluse, sippin' on some lean I would let loose
Lookin' in the mirror, watchin' myself lose
Cleaned up in oh-eight, got a job makin' barely minimum wage
To get into that page
Hit the road with R.L., performing in front of eight people
And that shit will check your ego
About around that time I'm watching that EP go
From nothing to getting us booked around the country
I know no limits, life can change in an instant
Eight people turn into sold out shows in a minute
Now watching my pops in the back row grinnin'
With his glass up to my mom, toastin' his Guinness

[Pre-Hook: Macklemore]
And we on, we on
Good music, it lies in the ambiance
One day we'll leave here
But these words live on
Till then, we keep on making the songs

[Hook: Macklemore]
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
Put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I remember that Freshman edition
Last year thinking to myself like
Yeah, nah, I won't win it yet, I probably won't get it, but
I'ma give it everything, play my position
The next 11 months I gave it all, everything I had in me
Left blood, sweat, tears in every god damn city
No label, no deal, no publicist, indie
Just music that connected and fans that rode with me
Throw me a gold mine, and a co-sign
While you're riding a couple dope rides
Two women, both dimes
Not gonna lie, that shit sounds so nice
But I got creative control, and my soul's mine
I wouldn't trade it, maybe I'm crazy
I put on for my city, Seattle, that raised me
Rule four-thousand-and-eighty, it's really not changing
Now a days make good music, the people are your label

[Hook: Macklemore]
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
Put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high
So put 'em up, up up, up up, so high

[Outro: Macklemore]
Oh my God
Feels like a victory lap
Can I have that moment
Can I talk my shit

[Interlude: Macklemore]
Now they say, "Don't forget where you come from
Don't die holding on to your words
Cause you know, that you got a whole world to change
But understand who you gotta change first"

[Outro: Macklemore]
Put 'em, up, up, up up
Up, up, up up
Put 'em, up, up, up up
Macklemore, Ryan Lewis
Put 'em up, up, up up
Up, up, up up
Put 'em, up, up, up up (so high)

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning
Rocked up
Dick hard like wolverine claws
Got up
Yeah I think I got to piss
Then my dick said
"naw motherfucker you were dreaming 'bout a bitch!!
Remember that chick
With the hips
Who walk with that switch
She was talking that shit?"
Oh yeah man ya girl ha?
Bitch fine
Matter of fact
I'mma call her ass right now
*ch-Bling*
"Bitch what's happening!?
Yeah yeah... blah blah...
Bitch what's happening!?
Ready to wear that pussy out
At the house
Make me shout
Like a man
Bout to knock it out the box"
She said
"yeah that's what your mouth say"
I said
"let's take to living room
And see just what the couch say!"
She said "later on today?"
My dick said "FUCK NAW HOE!! WE ALREADY ON OUR WAY!!"

[Chorus]
That bitch, that bitch, that bitch
She got me stiff
That ho that choke, that ho that choke
She got me hot in the snow
That broad, that broad, that broad, that broad
She got me hard
That woman, that woman, that woman, that woman
She know how to make my dick touch stomach

[Verse 2]
*Boom Boom*
To the southside
I said
"*bamp bamp* bitch
*bamp bamp* bitch I'm outside!!
You gone get yours
Now open your mouth wide"
She said
"pull that motherfucker out
And show me what you talking 'bout!"
Guess jeans flew off like a jet
Ain't clowning it was gone in seconds
I ain't lying nigga probably broke a record
'on ya mark get set'
You motherfucking well right and now
I was down that ho neck!!
She made me hit that 'GOOD LAWD!!'
Toes curling up
Dick jumping at her jaw like a frog
Boy!
This ho here a dog
She getting rubbernecked
And bumping up against the wall
She hit that head like a champ
I popped that fucking cock out her mouth
And hit a left and broke a lamp!!!
Damn!! it won't hold
It ain't quitting
Time for the 5 'o clock whistle
Bout to blow!!
*WOOOOOOOOOH!!!*

[Chorus]
That bitch, that bitch, that bitch
She got me stiff
That ho that choke, that ho that choke
She got me hot in the snow
That broad, that broad, that broad, that broad
She got me hard
That woman, that woman, that woman, that woman
She know how to make my dick touch stomach

[Verse 3]
I don' fucked around
And started hearing noise
I'm like
"hold on bitch
Where my motherfucking drawers!?"
She said
"they right here on the floor
Fuck wrong with you nigga??"
I said
"bitch you got somebody at the door!!!"
*ah-Booga Booga*
"aww hell..."
She said
"shit!! that's my old man
Who just got out of jail!!!"
I said "For what?"
She said
"domesticated violence!
He crazy get in the closet!"
I said "Bitch I know you lying!!!"
Boy!
I was just about to slug her
'til that nigga kicked the door
I hit that closet like a motherfucker
He grabbed that ho and said
"bitch what you doing?
Where that nigga at?
I know your ass in here screwing!!"
That ho toast
I'm roast in here stewing
My heart double timing
And my chest twitching
And this is the worst thing
I've ever seen without doing
I woke up from that dream
Like "what the fuck am I doing!!?"

[Chorus]
That bitch, that bitch, that bitch
She got me stiff
That ho that choke, that ho that choke
She got me hot in the snow
That broad, that broad, that broad, that broad
She got me hard
That woman, that woman, that woman, that woman
She know how to make my dick touch stomach

[Verse 1]
Scared of losing all the time
He wrote it in a letter
He was a friend of mine
He heard you could see your future
Inside a glass of water
The ripples and the lines
And he asked
"Will I see heaven in mine?"
That is just the way it was
Nothing could be better
And nothing ever was
Oh, they say you can see your future
Inside a glass of water
The riddles and the rhymes
Will I see heaven in mine?
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Son, don't ask
Neither half full nor empty
Is your glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living
In the past
Going nowhere fast

[Verse 2]
So he wrote it on a wall
The hollowest of halos
Is no halo at all
Television selling plastic
Figurines of leaders
Saying nothing at all
And you chime, Stars in heaven align
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Son, don't ask
Neither half full nor empty
Is your glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living
In the past
Going nowhere fast

[Outro]
And what are we drinking when we're done?
Glasses of water

[Intro]
Ayo, ayo Corey, listen man...
If there's one thing I can't stand it's, you know, these nondescripts
Acting like they don't know who the hell I am
You know what I mean? So that's why I gotta run down, nigga
You know, I'm Nicki Minaj, Nicki Lewinsky, the black Hannah Montana
When I do it, it get done

[Verse 1]
You must not know who I am
I don't get the spot 'till 2 IM
Don't be mad, lil mama, cause you not in
Everybody wanna roll with the crew I'm in
Look, they wanna know why I'm posted at the bar
I tell them I'm just signing posters at the bar
But really, I don't know why I'm posted at the bar
Ya bitches act up I got the toaster by the bar
I get cake cause I always got a hustle
I prompt weight and I ain't talkin' 'bout my muscle
Club everyday, but that ho ain't me
Cause I be home with the scale like Do-Re-Mi
I mean I walk like Onami, I mean Naomi
I keep the thing on me
And you know it ain't a bitch that's got a thing on me, no
That's why he wanna go and put a ring on me

[Hook]
He be like, "Oh, God! Girl, you bad"
He be like, "Oh, God! Girl, you bad"
I be like, "A million here, a million there there"
A million in the air, I mean in the lair-lair

[Verse 2]
You must not know who I be
On my way to Tai-Chi off the L.I.E
Don't be mad cause you not a ninja like me
Think she badder than Nicki, that's a L-I-E
Bitches know I'm half gone, I got my ski mask on
You bitches is too busy getting T-bagged on
When I do it, it get done, two sticks in my bun
Pull up in the 6 hun, they be fixin the run
Corset, Louis Vuitton; it be cuppin' my boobs
I just left petite Vuitton, let me buckle my shoes
Wait, hold on, little daddy, let me fix my suit
I got that presidential cooch; when he see it he salute
I am the mistress, stay with a rasta
If you get at him, I'll turn your brain into pasta
On 'em spaceships, yup we came in with NASA
Even out in Mars we the stars, oh my god

[Hook 2]
They be like, "Oh, God! Girl, you bad"
They be like, "Oh, God! Girl, you bad"
We be like, "a million here, a million there, there"
"A million in the air, I mean in the lair, lair"

[Verse 3]
You must not know who I are
Sucka-sucka MCs call me sire
I'm the ninja; my ad-libs say "hi-ya!" (Hi-ya!)
Konichiwa -- sayonara
Listen, I am the girl, the girl they call Nicki
I am young Nicki, finicky so picky
And I am like Jada, Halle and Kimora
No I'm not in church but this is Christian Dior-ah
I'm not impressed, I'm not impressed with you
I'mma need a lot of cheese and some mustard too
Cause I get more green then the vegetable
They say I'm rude, Yeah I'm rude like huxtable
I mean Rudy, I'm tutti-frutti
And I got some good cookies so they blew it and took it
I'm so Marylin Monroe
When the wind blow I'm Marylin Monroe

[Hook 3]
They be like, "Oh, God! Girl, you bad"
They be like, "Oh, God! Girl, you bad"
We be like, "A million here, a million there there
A milli in the air, I mean in the lair lair"

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Uhh
Ever thought about losing it
When your money’s all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell you that you due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side
Make a nigga wanna run straight through the fence
Open up the fridge 'bout 20 times
But you still can’t find no food in it
That’s foolishness
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
And the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought
How much that cost?
Does it even really matter?
'Cause if life is a uphill battle
But y’all tryna climb with the same ol’ ladder
In the same boat, with the same ol’ paddle
Why so shallow? I’m just askin'
What’s the pattern to the madness?
Everybody ain’t a number one draft pick
Most of us ain’t Hollywood actors
But if it’s all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
Sincerely yours, from one of y'all

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
I could feel your pain, I could feel your struggle
You just wanna live, but everything's so low
That you could drown in a puddle
That’s why I gotta hold us up, yeah, hold us up
For all the times no one’s ever spoke for us
To every single time that they play this song
You can say that that’s what Bobby Ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath gets so deep
And you feel like you’re just another person
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds
Uh, because we've both been there, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds
These are the things that’ve molded us
And if life hadn’t chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where I would've wound up
'Cause if it was up to me, I’d make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up, hey
But if it’s all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
From Bobby Ray, to all of y’all

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

[Intro]
Ooh-oh-oh-oh
Come on
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Well, I tried to tell you so (Yes, I did)
But I guess you didn't know
As the saddest story goes
Baby, now I got the flow
'Cause I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again
And show you that I'd win

[Pre-Chorus]
You lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me
Yes, I tried, yes I tried
You lied to me
Even though you knew I'd die for you
You lied to me
Yes, I cried, yes I cried

[Chorus]
Return of the Mack (There it is)
Return of the Mack (Come on)
Return of the Mack (Oh my God)
You know that I'll be back (Here I am)
Return of the Mack (Once again)
Return of the Mack (Top of the world)
Return of the Mack (Watch my flow)
You know that I'll be back (Here I go)

[Verse 2]
So, I'm back up in the game (Hustling slow)
Running things to keep my swing (All night long)
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
'Cause what you did you know was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done (Oh, oh, oh)
So baby listen carefully
While I sing my comeback song

[Pre-Chorus]
You lied to me
'Cause she said she'd never turn on me
You lied to me
But you did, but you did
You lied to me
All this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me
But I do, but I do, do, do

[Chorus]
Return of the Mack (There it is)
Return of the Mack (Hold on)
Return of the Mack (Don't you know)
You know that I'll be back (Here I go)
Return of the Mack (Oh, little girl)
Return of the Mack (Once my pearl)
Return of the Mack (Up and down)
You know that I'll be back (Round and round)

[Interlude: Angie Brown]
Ahh, Mark, stop lying about your big break
For God sake, I need a real man, uh
(The return of the mack, aoww) stop letting me down
Stop letting me down

[Pre-Chorus]
You lied to me
Cause she said she'd never turn on me
You lied to me
But you did, but you did
You lied to me
All this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me
But I do, but I do, do, do

[Chorus]
Return of the Mack (It is)
Return of the Mack (Come on)
Return of the Mack (Oh, my God)
You know that I'll be back (Here I am)
Return of the Mack (Once again)
Return of the Mack (Top of the world)
Return of the Mack (Watch my flow)
You know that I'll be back (Don't you know)
Return of the Mack (Here it is)
Return of the Mack (Hold on)
Return of the Mack (Be strong)
You know that I'll be back (Here I go)
Return of the Mack (My little baby)
Return of the Mack (Watch my flow)
Return of the Mack (Up and down)
You know that I'll be back (Round and round)

[Prod. Drumma Boy]

Verse 1:
They overdosing on my swag
Put the whole god damn hood in rehab
Too many rumples in my duffle
Can't close this bag its so much cash
I need 10 hands now to count my stash
LL Cool Gucci Mane I'm back
Never need a mask best check my stash
You must be hall-u-cin-a-tin
1st day out girl ain't you glad?
6 supermodels crashing at my pad
I should be a model drinking outta gold bottles
With some tru religion jeans sagging off my ass
Please don't crash am I goin' to fast
Touchdown anywhere I don't need no pass
Might need some gum cause I'm finna talk trash
Cuz keep em on task like a kid at class
Hater can't hit what a hater can't see
Untouchable these haters sure can't see me
He wouldn't know a hit if you hit him in the head
With a 4 by 4 standing 6 foot 3
Ready for a bitch, crocodile dun sheet
Never met a girl I ain't fuck first week
You never seem a g throw a 10,000 white mink
On the floor live on B.E.T (Gucci)

[Hook]
I only got life I can live
There's only so much game I can give
So you could watch the show chillin' at your crib
And weeks turn to months, and months turn to years
But I be smoking dro, Ima fuck some hoes
Ima ball today, wake up, then go ball some more
Can't tell a grown man what to do with his
It's your prerogative Ima mind my biz
But Ima live the life, forever rocking ice
Throwing money popping bottles cause that's just what I like
(x2)

Verse 2:
Screaming I'mma be like the Black Eyed Peas
I wanna be free and you wanna be me
Best eased if you really want beef
Ima fight you by the trees looking like swiss cheese
Just came home ain't thinking bout sleep
Bitch ya favorite rapper ain't slept in weeks
Thinkin' bout me like I'm down the street
Know it's over soon as my feet touch concrete
Pull up in South Beach blowing on trees
Whipping down the street like I'm riding on D's
A new ferrari flying down Peachtree
Girl I might roll ya window down Gucci Mane please
Make sure 2010 I'm free,fall off in the booth like 1017
Before I'm through fire jumping out the roof but we dont need water please bring more weed
Niggas can't win now they wanna switch teams, can't entertain that by no means
You wanna get on nigga chase your dreams,stop chasing me down like a dope fiend
Starting off my day with an M-16, shit ain't been the same since I turned 16
My whole life changed, now it's so icy
1st album on the charts came out same week (Gucci)

[Hook]

Verse 3:
My auntie had a stroke and she still can't speak, wrote me every week real talk thats deep
Ex-cell mate gotta 35 piece, won't be released till 2033
It's my son's birthday my boy turned 3, and looking at him is like looking at me
Can't look back and watch the moves I make
But the moves that I made fuck around and move me

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I see you writin' on my wall, why you wanna do that? (Do that)
My name's tagged you already see that (See that)
The media wanna paint it all black and they do it right in my face
See I can't sit back and let it all wash away (Wash away)
I worked too hard for it to be erased
Before you talk, I'ma finish what I gotta say

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I already put in time with all of my grindin'
All of my grindin', you know I grind
Through all of this struggle, all of this struggle
Even through the pain, I still had to hustle
Man, I had to feed my family
And at the same time keep my sanity, oh, no
Man, I can't let you do it

[Chorus]
Graffiti you're tryna spray (Spray, oh), spray on me (Me, oh)
Graffiti you're tryna spray (Spray, oh), on my name (Oh-oh-oh)
Graffiti you're tryna spray (Spray, oh), spray on me (Me, oh)
All the graffiti you're tryna spray (Spray, oh), on my name (Oh-oh-oh)
But it's already written on the wall
You can't cover it up, you can't cover it up (Woah)
But it's already written on the wall
You can't cover it up, you can't cover it up (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Who got award shows rockin' every time I hit the stage? (Time I hit the stage)
Even the haters went and bought a CD (CD)
Without my fans, I'm an empty spray can, and I just can't paint a thing
Seems like the less I had the money (Money), the less I had the problems (Problems)
The more I got the money (Money), the more I got the problems, ayo
Let me clear my throat, gotta make sure you hear me go

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I already put in time (Oh) with all of my grindin' (Oh)
All of my grindin' (Oh), you know I grind (Oh)
Through all of this struggle, all of this struggle (Hey)
Even through the pain, I still had to hustle
Man, I had to feed my family ('Ly)
And at the same time keep my sanity, oh, no
Man, I can't let you do it

[Chorus]
Graffiti you're tryna spray (Spray, oh), spray on me (Me, oh)
Graffiti you're tryna spray (Yeah, spray, oh), on my name (On my name, on my name, on my name, oh-oh-oh)
Graffiti you're tryna spray (Spray, oh), spray on me (You're tryna do it, oh)
All the graffiti you're tryna spray (Spray, na, na, na, oh), on my name (Yeah, oh-oh-oh)
'Cause it's already written on the wall
You can't cover it up, you can't cover it up (Woah)
'Cause it's already written on the wall
You can't cover it up, you can't cover it up (Baby)

[Bridge]
It's already done, ain't gotta paint no more
With all this pain that I've endured
I know I was wrong for what I did (Oh)
And I made some mistakes 'cause I'm human (Oh)
I ain't gon' feed into the negative
I'ma keep grinding, oh, yeah (Oh-oh-oh)
But this graffiti, oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I already put in time with all of my grindin'
All of my grindin', you know I grind
Through all of this struggle, all of this struggle
Even through the pain, I still had to hustle
Man, I had to feed my family
And at the same time keep my sanity, oh, no
Man, I can't let you do it

[Chorus]
Graffiti you're tryna spray (Spray, oh), spray on me (Me, oh)
Graffiti you're tryna spray (spray, oh), on my name (Oh-oh-oh)
Graffiti you're tryna spray (Spray, oh), spray on me (Oh)
All the graffiti you're tryna spray (Spray, oh), on my name (Oh-oh-oh)
You can't cover it up, you can't cover it up
You can't cover it up, you can't cover it up

[Intro: Chris Brown]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
This Virginia
Straight from the country, right there with my kinfolk
Golds in my mouth and they put 26's on Benzos
Dirt roads, back woods, they got weed but I've been dope
Ratchet, nigga, we act hood
But I'm gettin' money with these white folk
Sippin' and I'm faded, s-s-s-super medicated
Said she wanna check the pole, I said, "Okay, Sarah Palin"
Yeah, yeah-yeah-y-y-y-yeah, so I lay down and lay in
A nigga gon' be faded, all the way to the AM, yeah

[Interlude: Big Sean]

Okay, wow, bow, look at me now

Off tree every night like I roam with the owls

Show 'em no love, just throw 'em a towel
Still rockin' Louis Vuitton condoms (Still)
'Cause I'm so fuckin' in style, wow
New crib, crash that (Whoa)
Drove here, cab back (Swerve)

Hold up, hold up, whoa, don't be smokin' my shit (My shit)

[Interlude: Wiz Khalifa]
Tahahahaha, uh

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Smokin', chokin', always rollin' something
I don't need a key to start my car
Bitch, I just push a button
Did a show and got a half a mil'
And spent it like it's nothing, money flowin'
Never sober, smokin' 'til I got concussions, no discussion
Man, I got a condo and got a big crib
Pounds all over my kitchenettes
If I ain't on the road gettin' it
Then I'm in the hood where my niggas live
Did a tour, sold it out
Just bought a pound, 'bout to finish it
Now all my pasta got shrimp in it
You talk about it, and I'm livin' it (And I'm livin' it)

[Interlude: Wiz Khalifa & Big Sean]
Fuckin' little bitch, hahahahaha
Boi, whoa
Uh!

[Chorus: Big Sean, Chris Brown & Both]

Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game

Shawty blowin up my phone like a bomb threat
What's goin on baby?
Why you on that?

Okay I'm on my way, speedin windows up
So have my food warm, and have my pillows fluff
She been through the water, shawty guerilla tough
Shawty take all them shots like the Louis cup
I wanna give her all, and never give her up
I told her when it died down we could live it up
Where would you be, be without me?
Don't doubt me be about me baby, I'm like...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm like
As soon as I come home, I was workin long
She wanna know what I was working on
So I play her this song
And I make her feel wrong
But still in all in my eyesight, she passed right
I can't trip cuz no one loves the fast life
Or sittin in the passenger seat, hold tight
When she gives a whole platter to me, her whole life
But for me that's too much to eat, in one bite but
I'mma chew and just do what I gotta
Other bitches get the boot like a high top Prada
Where would you be, be without me?
Don't doubt me be about me baby, I'm like...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Can I talk to her, yeah, um
Leave the drama on daytime television
What is this detention?
It feel like elementary
I wish I never injure
Hurt or scar you
When I think of my future
Baby that are you
I mean that is you
Part of my fears
You know, part of my mental
See what I'm into?
See how I'm in too deep in the shit too?
It ain't just you, it is us two
I trust you, you gotta trust me
Cuz in them other bitches eyes I'm a must-see
Now where would you be, be without me?
Don't doubt me be about me girl
It's killin me
Wooooo
I must like it when you question me about it baby
I swear, but they say, it's just not true

I hated every time we go out
Got everybody complementing you
You love attention from a big crowd
Feels like I'm on the sideline
Right next to sucker, and I am the buster, girl
Who's this other guy, that's sending you these flowers
Oh, now you tell me, that your ex is your best friend

Call me crazy
But all I want is you
To myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous
But I just call it my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love

[Verse 2]
The smile on your face when you got that text late at night wasn't cause of me
Who else could it be?
And why when your with your friends it's always movie night or girl's night
It feels like I'm riding the bench
Right next to sucker, and I am the buster, girl
On the dance floor you're showing off your best moves
You've see my blown fuse, 'cause everybody's on you

Call me crazy
But all I want is you to myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love
Greedy love

Waddup Pharrell?

I say...

Uh! Its the Revenge Of The Nerd
Got a way with words like I got away with murder
Like I caught the state star witness tryin' to purge us
Sent the purse to the judge and bribed off the jurors
Bride of Frankenstein in the ride ‘fore we ride
Any further West Side yes I roll here like a curler
And I hold hair like a hurler, The Curse of the Mummy on
The money of the merger of the worlds of the worker and the surfer
Return to my girl, UH Lunch, dinner, desert/dessert her
Like a armed forces server that served in Desert Storm
That couldn't perform any further, A breath of fresh air like Certs
Slightly off my walls made of Serta
Hero to the star crossed lovers in search of…
Yea, and thats what a verse does
I represent the First droppin' the vert reverse cuz...

Come on let me kiss that
Ooh, I know you miss that
What's wrong? Let me fix that

[Hook: John Legend]
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had

The best you ever had

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Luda! Listen
You ain't even gotta text me
Knowing me and you got that mental telepathy
Me be up at the spot, I'll be sending over the chauffeur
Rich nigga, bread stay popping like a toaster
Nobody come close to me and you together
Step under my umbrella
We’ll make it through any weather
Except when I make it storm
Sex in the greatest form
And hibernate under my body
Yep, I keep it warmer than a chinchilla
She know I beat it up like the Thrilla in Manila
Flying my private jet to villas in Anguilla
Then throw you on a grill
Cause seven days a week you’re my five course meal
(For real)

[Hook: John Legend]
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that

The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had

[Verse 1]
What if it rained?
We didn't care
She said that someday soon, the sun was gonna shine
And she was right
This love of mine
My Valentine

[Verse 2]
As days and nights
Would pass me by
I tell myself that I was waiting for a sign
Then she appeared
A love so fine
My Valentine

[Bridge]
And I will love her for life
And I will never let a day go by
Without remembering the reasons why
She makes me certain that I can fly

[Verse 3]
And so I do
Without a care
I know that someday soon, the sun is gonna shine
And she'll be there
This love of mine
My Valentine

[Verse 1]
What if it rained?
We didn't care
She said that someday soon, the sun was gonna shine
And she was right
This love of mine
My Valentine

[Intro]
Good morning, good morning
Good morning, good morning
Good morning

[Verse 1]
Nothing to do to save his life, call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day, how's your boy been?
Nothing to do, it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's okay

[Chorus]
Good morning, good morning
Good morning

[Verse 2]
Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home, you start to roam, then you're in town

[Bridge 1]
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street

[Verse 3]
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's okay

[Chorus]
Good morning, good morning
Good morning

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge 2]
People running round, it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and Meet the Wife

[Verse 4]
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts, you start to flirt, now you're in gear
Go to a show, you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say, but it's okay

[Chorus]
Good morning, good morning
Good...

[Outro]
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good

Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut
Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut

Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut (Ja! Ja!)

Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut (Ja!)

[Intro]
Fuck it, I want no bullshit pullin', man. No bullshit over here, kid. Straight from queens, man. Flushing to be exact. Shit

[Verse 1]
Fuck the light at the end of the tunnel
Cause I'm living for today, trying not to drown in a bottle
Death all around me, drugs seem to numb me
Mental's getting sicker, the Devil's getting comfy
Acupuncture with the smoke like I'm Mason Storm
Legs crossed like a Buddhist, smoking Buddha
Angry tuna, chilling, getting brain from Uma
Used to lose, now everybody kangaroos
Hop off the schnitzel, see me on Kissena
Smoke the marijueena, always been the same guy
Whether balling on a yacht, or hauling from the cops
I'm flooring on the Fox, 'til I'm swelled up in a box
All you gotta do is see me when you see me
I'm burning bitches from the TV like a CD
I'm trynna live the life in 3D
So you could nibble on my pee-pee
We out in Fiji

[Hook]
From having money on my mind to having money in my pocket
Bone marrow roasted
Spread it on the rosemary bread, lightly toasted
Drizzle with the vinaigrette
Stuffed Dutches and it's pulling like a cigarette

[Verse 2]
Until I'm tan skinned, bitches saying that I'm handsome
'Bout to be up on the screen like Ted Danson
Suede loincloth, never fall off
Mr. Wonderful, Paul Orndorff
Leather jacket, knee length
Peace to people getting money in the 80's with the freebase
First time, you get a free taste
That's the start of a career chase, I'm eating cheese plate
Skirt steak shaved straight up off the diaphragm
Muay Thai title fights out in Thailand
I spit the fly shit, accompanied by fly bank
Use the flows that have me diving up in thighs tan
Purple rain, no Prince, summer solstice
Dope body, but her pussy's like an old fish
The antipasti is a cold dish
Yo, I'm focused, catch me out in London speaking Polish

[Hook]

[Intro]

[Verse 2]

Lookin' so clean every time I ride through

Hit the high school, sittin' on 26
What's hannenin'?
Do it big, I wanna do it big
Do it big, what's hannenin'?

[Chorus]
Hannenin', hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'
Hannenin', hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'
Hannenin', what's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin'? What's hannenin'?
What's hannenin', hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'?
Hannenin', hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'
Hannenin', hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'
Hannenin', hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'
What's, what's, what's, what's
What's, what's, what's, what's hannenin'?
What's hannenin', hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'?
What's hannenin', hannenin', hannenin'?

[Verse 1: CeeLo Green]
What?! That real, that deep, that burning, that amazing unconditional, inseparable love
That feel like forever
That always emotional but still exceptional love
Can't nobody tell me nothing it is what it is, and
Any mistake you make I, I just may forgive
Oh!
Right now, right now at this very moment
Still love her like I loved her then
Oh, I love her in and out and up and down and 'round and 'round
And over and over again
So rare they swear that you just don't exist, and
It's only one person I can think of make me feel like this
And I'm a fool, such a fool!
For you!

[Verse 2: Melanie Fiona]
Oh! So sweet, so deep
So real, ooh wee God damn, that's some powerful stuff
Oh!
How you do it do-do-do it, keep it coming, baby, I can't seem to get enough
What you do, what you say
Makes me want to lo-lo-love you
Baby, I don't even have a choice
Oh! And if I did it'd still be you
Cause you're the man among these other boys
Sweet sugar, I surrender
White flag, oh, I won't even put up a fight
Oh! Cause there ain't a damn thing wrong about this kind of loving
Ooh, when it feels so right
Call her, write a letter, tell it to my mama
And she gon' tell the world that I love you!
Oh! Some people probably say I'm crazy
But I don't mind, being a fool for you

[Chorus: Both]
I'm a fool, I'm a fool, such a fool
Such a fool, such a fool, such a fool
For you

[Intro]
Let's, excuse me, baby
Go, yeah you, baby
Back, oh you groovy, baby
In, let's make a movie, baby
Time, excuse me, baby
Let's, yeah you, baby
Go, oh you groovy, baby
Back in, let's make a movie, baby
Time

[Interlude]
It's Mr Worldwide, Agent A, reporting live
From Cape Canaveral, MK, Big Syphe, let's ride
Back, back, in, in, time

[Chorus]
Baby
Ohhh, baby
Ohhh, baby
My sweet baby
You're the one

[Verse 1]
Miami equals
Black mask, black clothes
With a little bit of rope to tie, I flipped it
Black suits, white shirts, black glasses with a matching tie
Like Agent J or Agent K, and I wish the whole world would
Ok, I'm tryin' make a billion out of 15 cents
Understand, understood
I'm a go-getter, mover, shaker, culture
Bury a boarder, record-breaker, won't cha
Give credit where credit is due, don't cha
Know that I don't give a number two
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future
We have to go back in time

[Chorus]
Baby
Ohhh, baby
Ohhh, baby
My sweet baby
You're the one

[Verse 2]
I got the globe, yeah, in the palm of my hand
Wherever I spin it, that's where I land
Let's save the world
Men In Black, I know you understand
Stop the movement, they can try if they want to
Ignorar lo latino, si, they can try if they want to
What Pit solves is a bit raw
Took like jigsaw and built it all
Despite a big loss, I'd bet it all
And fought blind against the world, Ray Charles
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future
We have to go back in time

[Chorus]
Baby
Ohhh, baby
Ohhh, baby
My sweet baby
You're the one

[Interlude]
Let's, excuse me, baby
Go, yeah, you, baby
Back, oh you groovy, baby
In, let's make a movie, baby
Time, excuse me, baby
Let's, yeah you, baby
Go, oh you groovy, baby
Back in, let's make a movie, baby
Time

[Chorus]
Baby
My sweet baby
My sweet baby
My sweet baby
You're the...
Baby
Ohhh, baby
Ohhh, baby
My sweet baby
You're the one

[Verse 1]
Stuntin' all on my old hoes, styling all on my haters
Presidential is rose gold, say it's time to get paper
Glock 10 with that laser, fuck around meet yo maker
Every month got me pissin', fuck around with them papers
So I can't smoke no kush, I can't smoke no kush
But I ran through them hoes, and I ain't talk 'bout Reggie Bush
I say y'all fuck niggas so fold, hoes ain't never gon' look
In the kitchen with that pyrex and a 9 piece, let me cook
Now hold up, I went and bought a Phantom cause I wanted to
And now I drive the same whips as Stunna do
Real nigga, 100 proof
I'ma need a 100 M's to make me comfortable

[Chorus]
Stuntin' all on my old hoes, styling all on my haters
Presidential is rose gold, say it's time to get paper
Big crib with no neighbors, ball hard but no Lakers
Spent a 100 racks on my chain, all them hoes know my name
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these niggas
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these bitches
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these niggas
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these bitches

[Verse 2]
All I know is just flex, shittin' on my ex
Bad hoes on my team, dick 'em down like Next
I rock YSL so fresh, fly as hell no jet
Waves on 360, make that pussy get so wet
She say I'm cocky, I say that's not me
She call me papi and I say ven aqui
Wrist wear on hockey, Porsche box like Ali
My sneaks they bally, in my hood I'm prolly just rollin 'round in that ghost
Watching out for them folks
Heater on my hip, trunk full of that work
I say my shooters like Dirk, 10 racks and you murk
I put that on yo head nigga, first week and you dead nigga
I bottle pop, I model pop
Pull up on them bikes, let the throttle pop
Niggas know I'm nice, and I got a lot
Like fuck yo corner, I buy the block

[Chorus]
Stuntin' all on my old hoes, styling all on my haters
Presidential is rose gold, say it's time to get paper
Big crib with no neighbors, ball hard but no Lakers
Spent a 100 racks on my chain, all them hoes know my name
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these niggas
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these bitches
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these niggas
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these bitches

[Verse 3]
I don't chase no bitches, I just chase my dreams
We ridin' 'round so dirty in this whip that's so clean
My old head, she 30 but that dick suck so mean
And that pussy just so good for that pipe, she my fiend
On that pint I just lean, perk got me bent
If you ain't talking 'bout money, you ain't got no sense
Smell it on my clothes, work got that scent
In that kitchen with them birds, 'bout to serve up that's din' - Hold up!
OZ's and whole keys, straight white and no trees
Great white and OZ's and they might just OD
I stay tight with OG's, they know I'm real nigga
Pocket full of them racks and my bank account, Meek Mill nigga

[Chorus]
Stuntin' all on my old hoes, styling all on my haters
Presidential is rose gold, say it's time to get paper
Big crib with no neighbors, ball hard but no Lakers
Spent a 100 racks on my chain, all them hoes know my name
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these niggas
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these bitches
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these niggas
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these bitches

[Verse One]
Five minute beats, one take raps
No false stories of my gunplay stats
Drugs sit beside me, blunts stay fat
Hand-craft the music, rhymes stay acoustic
Pies and Thighs on my mind all the time, roll the lime
Fuck rap I was class with my bus pass
Early nineties Tom Selleck with the moustache
Your eyes are blind to the diamond in the rough
Needle in the hay, charismatic character, far from amateur
Spider senses so I'm scanning the parameter
Straight from scrubs so my uncle is a janitor
Love my Mother, hate a motherfucker, hate a piece o' shit, hate a cocksucker
Stand beside me motherfucker you're my brother
Came from different pussies but we share the same supper

[Hook]
Five minute beats, one take raps
No false stories of my gunplay stats
Drugs sit beside me, blunts stay fat
Blunts stay fat, blunts stay fat

[Verse Two]
West Palm Beach betting on a dog race
Bitch with me big titties and a small waist
Pistol noise, shiftin' in a Hitler toy
Kick shit, young Ruud van Nistelrooy
Eating brisket, chilling at the bris
Knuckles like I punch walls metal in the fist
Smoking seven kinds of pepper and shit
Veteran shit, give Melissa Etheridge a dick
Stroke pussy like a cat lover
My kids are mixed that means they got a black Mother
And their Father's a G
Strictly Oolong on the tea, the shirt straight from '93, man with the ski
Peace to lo-lives Brooklyn, smart crew Queens
Sharp tooth fiends in the chartreuse jeans
Old Girbaud shit, pockets in the front
Waist 33, odd sizes out of Marshalls

[Hook]
Five minute beats, one take raps
No false stories of my gunplay stats
Drugs sit beside me, blunts stay fat
Blunts stay fat, blunts stay fat
Kid, Queens shit, Blue Chips shit

[Verse]
Ayo, my headbands filled with acid, out of body
Mind trick, mind sick like Magic Johnson's dick
You know your shorty lettin' Bronson hit
Stuff penis down the neck like it's lozenges
Two bags of drug sleep, 'bout to wake 'em up, though
Stay sharp, cut quarts with the cutthroats
Don't snort, use gloves when you cut dope
Won't stop, eat box on a plush boat
The brougham, forest green with peanut butter
Jelly belly, fuckin' in a smelly telly
African room, drugs up in the nightstand
Look in my eyes, "Daddy, make the light dance!"
Nice pants, cut off at the knee
Cuttlefish, cut up on the beach, out the sea
Mix it with the lime juice, smidgen of its own ink
(Ah, the beat cut out)

[Verse 1]
You can force it but it will not come
You can taste it but it will not form
You can crush it but it's always here
You can crush it but it's always near
Chasing you home
Saying

[Chorus]
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken

[Verse 2]
You can force it but it will stay stone
You can crush it as dry as a bone
You can walk it home straight from school
You can kiss it, you can break all the rules
All of the rules
But still

[Chorus]
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken
Everyone is, everyone is broken
Everyone is, everything is broken

[Outro]
Why can't you forget?
Why can't you forget?
Why can't you forget?

[Verse 1]
Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you?
Alone on an aeroplane
Falling asleep against the windowpane
My blood will thicken

[Verse 2]
I need to wash myself again
To hide all the dirt and pain
'Cause I'd be scared that there's nothing underneath
And who are my real friends?
Have they all got the bends?
Am I really sinking this low?

[Chorus]
My baby's got the bends, oh no
We don't have any real friends
No, no, no

[Post-Chorus]
Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the '60s, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen

[Verse 3]
Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you?
They brought in the CIA
The tanks and the whole marines
To blow me away
To blow me sky high

[Chorus]
My baby's got the bends
We don't have any real friends

[Post-Chorus]
Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the '60s, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would...

[Bridge]
I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be a part of the human race
I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be a part of the human race
Race, race, race

[Outro]
Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you?

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
If you were there, beware the serpent soul pinchers
Three-hundred and fifty "No, thank you"s and nobody flinches
Go on, girl, go on, give us something gruesome
We require your grief, the thugs help the thieves
As they're trying to rob the words from her gob and
Take the swords to the innocents

[Verse 2]
If you were there, beware the serpent soul pinchers
Can't you sense she was never meant to fill column inches
Ain't you had enough? What you're trying to dig up
Isn't there to be dug; the thieves help the thugs
As they're trying to beat the good grace of a sweetheart
Out to the point she'll comply

[Bridge]
And why leave her on her own?
If I'd have known then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known
Why leave her on her own?
If I predicted tears then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it if I would have known

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
There's a circle of witches, ambitiously vicious they are
And our attempts to remind them of reason won't get us that far
But I don't know what it is that they want
I don't know what it is that they want
But I haven't got it to give
And she hasn't got it to give

[Verse 1]
A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide

[Chorus]
And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent

[Verse 2]
This is my final fit
My final bellyache with

[Chorus]
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please

[Verse 3]
Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden

[Chorus]
No alarms and no surprises
(Get me out of here)
No alarms and no surprises
(Get me out of here)
No alarms and no surprises, please
(Get me out of here)

[Verse 1]
Faith, you're driving me away
You do it every day
You don't mean it, but it hurts like hell
My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen
From my life support, my iron lung

[Verse 2]
We're too young to fall asleep
Too cynical to speak
We are losing it, can't you tell?
We scratch our eternal itch
Our twentieth century bitch
We are grateful for our iron lung

[Chorus]
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon

[Verse 3]
Suck, suck your teenage thumb
Toilet trained and dumb
When the power runs out, we'll just hum
This, this is our new song
Just like the last one
A total waste of time, my iron lung

[Chorus]
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon

[Bridge]
And if you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's okay
And if you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's okay

[Chorus]
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
Put this on a Zip disk, send it to your lawyer
File me under "Funky"

Like sipping lemonade and Arnold Palmers
Big holiday parties like Dolly Padner

Sometimes I get Pad Thai as a starter
My other order, Pad See Yew, is much darker

Adam Horovitz, I take a shvitz
I'm known for my glamour and my glitz, check it

As I bust, I really must encrust
This microphone rust with Diamond fairy dust

I don't wear Crocs and I don't wear sandals
The pump don't work cause the vandals took the handle

Stop singing that song in the wrong key
What you looking at? Funky donkey
Funky donkey
Funky donkey
I-I-I-I-I go woooo-ooo like a fire engine
Flashing lights to get your attention

Stop sweating me about the weather
Go shave a sheep and knit yourself a sweater

Don't get me heated or y'all in trouble
Bass is booming make the dancehall bubble

Letting loose, up in the honkey tonk
With the shoopa doopa doo bedonk

Well, I was swimming in the water of the ocean
Like Dr. Jekyll with the magic potion

We're brand new, never ever the same
What's that, what's that, what's the name?
Funky donkey
Funky donkey
Funky donkey

[Intro]
I'm back at it, automatic
I'm back at it, automatic
Let's go

[Verse]
Yeah I know I'm probably wasting my time
But listen here, I got some shit on my mind
I know its obvious that I'm the talk of the town
You seem to move fame or get the money bringing you down

[Pre-Hook]
Everywhere I go its a media frenzy
All they seem to care about is me Kim or Lindsey
Is the story real? You don't even know
Do you even care? Yeah I thought so
Yeah yeah I know they wanna see me

[Hook]
I can't lose focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money
I'm losing focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money

[Verse]
Yeah I know I'm probably wasting my time
But listen here, I got some shit on my mind
I know its obvious that I'm the talk of the town
You seem to move fame or get the money bringing you down

[Pre-Hook]
Everywhere I go its a media frenzy
All they seem to care about is me Kim or Lindsey
Is the story real? You don't even know
Do you even care? Yeah I thought so
Yeah yeah I know they wanna see me

[Hook]
I can't lose focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money
I'm losing focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money

[Bridge]
I'm back at it, automatic
I'm back at it, automatic

[Hook]
I can't lose focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money
I'm losing focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money
I can't lose focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money
I'm losing focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it "Love"
But even the sun
Sets in paradise

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If happy-ever-after's did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick, oh

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it "Love"
But even the sun
Sets in paradise

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Whoa, whoa-oa)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Wiz Khalifa]
If happy-ever-after's did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick (Uh)
Now, I'm at a payphone

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money while you're sitting 'round
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothin'
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Whoo!)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (For two?)
(Yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
If happy-ever-after's did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all these fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone

[Chorus]
Aha, aha
I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

[Verse 1]
Let's take it to the basics, you in the midst of greatness
My Martin was a Maison, rocked Margielas with no laces
Cristal go by the cases, wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces, ain't no different when you taste it
A 40 ounce to chase it, that's just a understatement
I'm early to the party, but my 'Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
Life's a mothafucka, ain't it? These other rappers ain't us
So tell me what your name is, I'ma tell it to my stainless
You aim it 'fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
It's just me, myself, and I and mothafuckas that I came with
Miscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me
Until I tell 'em to they face they ain't no G
Low key, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

[Chorus]
I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

[Verse 2]
Yes, I'm the shit, tell me do it stink?
It feel good wakin' up to money in the bank
Three model bitches, cocaine on the sink
And I'm so 'bout it 'bout it, I might roll up in a tank
Cause my chain came from Cuba, got a lock up on the link
And them red bottom loafers just to compliment the mink
Eyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank
What you mean? Tell me what you drink, I'm on that kissin' pink
You could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state
Man on the moon, got a condo out in space
Open up your legs, tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em, “Tell it to my face”
Tell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick
In a six, told her suck a dick, motorboat her tits
I'm the shit, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig-Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

[Chorus]
I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

[Outro]
Oh, yeah, oh, right
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off (Right, right)

[Produced by Beyoncé, Switch & The-Dream]

[Chorus]
Come take my hand, I won't let you go
I'll be your friend, I will love you so deeply
I will be the one to kiss you at night
I will love you until the end of time
I'll be your baby, I'll promise not to let you go
Love you like crazy, now say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go (Say)
Say you'll never let me go (Hey)
Say you'll never let me go (Say)
Say you'll never let me go

[Verse 1]
Take you away from here
There's nothing between us but space and time
I'll be your own little star
Let me shine in your world
In your own little universe, make me your girl

[Chorus]
Come take my hand, I won't let you go
I'll be your friend, I will love you so deeply
I will be the one to kiss you at night
I will love you until the end of time
I'll be your baby, I'll promise not to let you go
Love you like crazy, now say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go (Say)
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go (Say)
Say you'll never let me go

[Verse 2]
Baby, come on get up on it
Show me that you really want it
I wanna be the one to love you, baby, let's go (Whoa)
Let's go (Whoa)
I wanna provide this loving that you're giving
I ain't frontin' in this love, but
Can you let me love you from your head to toe? (Whoa)
Baby, let's go (Whoa)

[Verse 3]
Boy, come to me (Come to me)
Let me turn your rain into sun (Come to me, baby)
You don't have to worry, baby (Oh, no)
I promise I'll set your heart free
Let my love into your soul
You go, I go, we go, that's all she wrote

[Breakdown]
Say you'll, say, say, say you'll, nev-never
Say you'll, say, say, say you'll, nev-never
Say you'll, say, say, say you'll, nev-never
Say you'll, say, say, say you'll, nev-never
(Can't you see, babe?)
Say you'll, say, say, say you'll, nev-never
Say you'll, say, say, say you'll, nev-never
(I just wanna love you)
Say you'll, say, say, say you'll, nev-never
Say you'll, say, say, say you'll, nev-never
(Can't you feel me, babe?)
Say you'll, say, say, say you'll, nev-never
Say you'll, say, say, say you'll, nev-never
I just wanna be with you
I just wanna live with you
I'll never let you go
Free your love to me

[Chorus]
Come take my hand, I won't let you go
I'll be your friend, I will love you so deeply
I will be the one to kiss you at night (You at night)
I will love you until the end of time
I'll be your baby, I'll promise not to let you go
Love you like crazy, now say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go (Say)
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go (Say)
Say you'll never let me go

[Verse 1]
I feel weak, we've been here before
'Cause I feel we keep going back and forth
Maybe it's over, maybe we're through
But I honestly can say "I still love you"

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find

[Chorus 1]
Let's start over, let's give love their wings
Let's start over, stop fighting 'bout the same old thing
Let's start over, we can't let our good love die
Maybe we can start all over, give love another life

[Verse 2]
I can see that we're not happy here
So why would we keep pretending when there's nothing there?
Maybe you like it, well, I don't
And maybe you'll settle, well, I won't

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find

[Chorus 1]
Let's start over, let's give love their wings
Let's start over, stop fighting 'bout the same old thing
Let's start over, we can't let our good love die
Maybe we can start all over, and give love another life

[Bridge]
I know that this will hurt you, I know you'll cry
I know I called you selfish, but that's a lie
I feel I know what's best for us

[Chorus 2]
Let's start over
And let's give love their wings
Let's start over, I'm tired of fighting 'bout the same old thing
Let's start over, we both know that this love won't die
Maybe we can start all over, and give love another life

[Verse 1]
More money, more riches
More freaky model misses
Six-four booty making hit switches
Shawty sitting on 40 inches
I like her, she like me
I wanna love her, she wanna love me
That happening is unlikely
I got her thong where the ceiling fan lights be
Spinning like a tornado
Then I eat it up like it's gourmet food
Then I beat it up like boom, boom, boom
Then I get ghost like zoom
Climb on top of me, underneath the sheets
'Cause I'm about to take you down
And change your last name to Mrs. Brown

[Chorus]
She know she can get it, get it (Oh)
She know she can get it (Oh), get it (Oh)
She know she can get it (Oh), get it (Oh)
So I'ma give it to her with that ghetto Kama Sutra
She know she can get it, get it (Woah, woah, woah, woah, girl)
She know she can get it, get it (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
She know she can get it, get it (Woah, woah, woah, woah, baby)
So I'ma give it to her with that ghetto Kama Sutra (Oh)
I'ma give it to her

[Verse 2]
If I don't give it to her, she gon' take it
But when she do it to you, she be faking
She a five-star chick on my A-list
I have her body bent over like the Matrix
I ain't mad at her, do ya thing, girl
I bet you never had an R&B singer
I promise you will never go back
So let me hit it out the park
It go V.A., L.A., New York, Atlanta
Houston, Chi-Town, rolling on the tour bus
I seen a lot of ladies but I'm feeling you
I gotta let you know, shawty, you can get it

[Chorus]
She know she can get it, get it (Hey!)
She know she can get it, get it (Hey!)
She know she can get it, get it (Hey!)
So I'ma give it to her with that ghetto Kama Sutra
She know she can get it, get it (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
She know she can get it, get it (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
She know she can get it, get it (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
So I'ma give it to her with that ghetto Kama Sutra (Oh)
I'ma give it to her

[Intro]
Every child grows up, with the thought of being something special in life
But what happens when the one that they depend on the most is never there?

[Verse 1]
Told that I'm supposed to fail
I wouldn't amount to much of nothing
Yes, I pray
There was days I wondered if you really loved me
But baby, you feel pain
Mama was sane when I felt like running away
I couldn't take it
I soon hit 10, angry with all of the world
I couldn't keep friends, just wishing you'd come back and see
My difficult times being an adolescent
And like so many just like me without a shoulder to lean

[Chorus]
I needed you when I needed a father figure
I needed you to stop me from making the wrong decisions
At 17, when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall

[Post-Chorus]
I need, I needed you
Every child grows up, with the thought of being something special in life
But what happens when the one that they depend on the most is never there?
I need, I needed you

[Verse 2]
Told that I'm supposed to fail
I wouldn't amount to much of nothing
Yes, I pray
There was days I wondered if you really loved me
But baby, you feel pain
Mama was sane when I felt like running away
I couldn't take it
I soon hit 10, angry with all of the world
I couldn't keep friends just wishing you'd come back and see
My difficult times being an adolescent
And like so many just like me without a shoulder to lean

[Chorus]
I needed you when I needed a father figure
I needed you to stop me from making the wrong decisions
At 17, when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall
When temptation was calling me, didn't know which way to go
I needed you
I need, I needed you
I needed you
I need, I need you
17 when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall
When temptation was calling me, didn't know which way to go

[Verse 2]
Mama had no financial help
And thoughts of breaking the law came
See her hurt tryna hold down two jobs
Was tearing up on me
Had a way
All my friends was getting it in
It came time for me to get that dough
Wrong or right
I had to go for what I know

[Chorus]
I needed you when I needed a father figure
I needed you to stop me from making the wrong decisions
At 17, when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall
When temptation was calling me, didn't know which way to go
I needed you
I need, I needed you
I needed you
I need, I need you
17 when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall
When temptation was calling me, didn't know which way to go

[Outro]
Lord I pray, give me strength to forgive them and not all the I hate I got
Even though the pain sometimes as too heavy
Lord I pray, show me all brothers growing up without a father
How to turn with a day adolescent to a legacy, Lord I pray
From the knowledge I ain't get, God, you gave me
And temptation was calling me, didn't know which way to go

[Timbaland Verse 1]
I can't believe you be coming around the clock with that same old blahzay
I got plans to drive past you, to make you regret, yeah
And why the hell you be parked with your volume, turned up all the way
I'm not a phantom, you're picking your snare, your career'sin jeopardy
I got pretty big songs, pretty big songs, yeah, yeah
I got speakers and sounds, bigger than dolls, yeah, yeah
None of that,(clapping) in the beat here, beat down man, yeah, yeah
I won't tell you radio go away

[Hook]
And when the music's gone, there be no more songs, no more songs
When the party's broke, I said I still live on, still live on
And when the music's gone, there be no more tone, no more tone
When the spell is broke and that I have told, I still got getaway

[Timbaland Verse 2]
You hear me from a block away, I still got getaway
Check it, I got the feeling I'mma hurt your feelings when you hear my system
Check it, so loud my surround sound will take no victims
I'm not a phantom, you're picking your snare, your courage is in jeopardy
I got pretty big songs, pretty big songs, yeah, yeah
I got speakers and sounds, bigger than dolls, yeah, yeah
None of that,(clapping) in the beat here, beat down man, yeah, yeah
I won't tell you radio go away

[Hook]
And when the music's gone, there be no more songs, no more songs
When the party's broke, I said I still live on, still live on
And when the music's gone, there be no more tone, no more tone
When the spell is broke and that I have told, I still got getaway

[Brandi Hook]
You hear me from a block away, I still got getaway
Baby can you hear me now, can you hear me now?
Baby can you hear me now, can you hear me now?

[Brandi Verse]
I'm like the bass and the trunk if you want I can ride the way
Baby just tell me where you're at and I'm on my way
No matter how far, we could push cruise control
Any way you want, tell me where you want to go

[Hook]
And when the music's gone, there be no more songs, no more songs
When the party's broke, I said I still live on, still live on
And when the music's gone, there be no more tone, no more tone
When the spell is broke and that I have told, I still got getaway
Get over, you hear me from a block away, I still got getaway

[Talking]
Baby it appears that you've... done something to me
And I don't know what you did
But you done did it girl
Yeah, you done did it

[Verse 1]
Ooh honey, I could have all the money in the world
But it wouldn't be nothing without you girl
And ooh baby you could offer me all the ladies in the world
But I don't want one cuz ain't none like my girl
And baby tell me how can I explain it
A love bullet went through my soul
You took my heart and rearranged it
And now you got full control
My mistakes and my bad ways
Girl you made a change in this man baby

[Hook]
I don't want to touch another
I don't want to feel another woman
Never gonna be another
I ain't gotta see another woman (Nobody but you girl)
Lover come close to me
Let me have my way do all I want
Put your body where its supposed to me
Ain't gotta worry 'bout me
Cuz all I want is to please, to kiss, to find a place inside
Your Love
I'll do whatever I need to find a place in your love

[Verse 2]
Ooooh you just got me feelin like a nigga need sexual healing
Ooooooh, oooh babe, oooh babe
Don't you go no further
Don't be no distant lover
No baby
And if you let me get it right here, right now I swear
When you let me get it inside you'll feel I care

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I just want to find a place baby
Inside of you, you, you, you
Let me get it right here right now
Baby girl I swear
If you let me get it
You gon' feel I care
Oh, Oh, Oh
You gon' feel I care
Wooahhh
Baby you gon' feel I care
Yes I care

[Trey Talking]
Thank you all
Thank you all
This is anticipation II
Whoop!

[Verse 1]
Since day one I said fuck the fame and everything it dealt
But the fame is really here just to facilitate the wealth
But the wealth attracts you haters like mosquitos to a well
And the waters getting deeper so I must set out to sail
Someone called my cell, and left a voicemail
They said congratulations on the million record sales
As I'm flippin over furniture, knockin' shit off the shelf
I told myself I'd never get too deep to take a breath but I'm sinkin

[Hook]
And it's so hard to breathe, yeah
And even more so to sleep when no one cares
It was all I could need
But now I'm sinking, so deep, I can't come up for air

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I've seen the valley of the shadow of death
I've seen the mountains, a wild childhood
That's why I sing about it
I just try to move on and keep my peace about it
But come to think about it I can't even count the days
That I spent starvin' tryin' to find a some decent housing
It's why I'm always smiling but on this beat I seem so violent
So ask me about the music scene and what the fuck I think about it
Time flies I guess that's why I'm buggin
Just yesterday I was rappin with my brother and my cousin
If you had the stove or toaster on you couldn't use the oven
We knew that we were struggling we just actin like we wasn't
It was either make it rapping, if not that then hustling
So all I see is magazine covers in this game
You either surface or you plummet
It's a thin line and I'm just tryin to keep my head above it, damn

[Hook]
And it's so hard to breathe, yeah
And even more so to sleep when no one cares
It was all I could need
But now I'm sinking, so deep, I can't come up for air

Air I (I sink away)
Air (I sink away)
Air (As I sink away) I (Damn I sink away)
Damn air damn pots and pans
Get carried away damn get carried away it
Was never in the plans
But hey, it's long way from beatin' pots and pans

[Hook]
And it's so hard to breathe, yeah
And even more so to sleep when no one cares
It was all I could need
But now I'm sinking, so deep, I can't come up for air

Damn it was never in the plans
But hey, it's a long way from beatin' pots and pans
But now I'm sinking so deep I can't come up for air, air, ah

[Verse 1]
There's only so many songs that I can sing to pass the time
And I'm running out of things to do to get you off my mind, Ooh
All I have is this picture in a frame
That I hold close to see your face everyday!

[Hook]
With you is where I'd rather be
But we're stuck where we are
And its so hard
You're so far
This long distance is killing me
I wish that you were here with me!
But we're stuck where we are
And its so hard
You're so far
This long distance is killing me!

Its so hard, its so hard
Where we are, where we are
You're so far
This long distance is killing me
Its so hard, its so hard
Where we are, where we are
You're so far
This long distance is killing me

[Verse 2]
Now the minutes feel like hours and the hours feel like days
While I'm away
And no right now I can't be home
But im comin' home soon
Comin' home soon
All I have is this picture in a frame
That I hold close to see your face again (OH!)

[Hook]
With you is where i'd rather be
But we're stuck where we are
And its so hard
You're so far
This long distance is killin me
I wish that you were here with me!
But we're stuck where we are
And its so hard
You're so far

Can you hear me crying?
(Oooohhhhh)
Can you hear me crying?
(Oooohhhh)
Can you hear me crying?
(ooohhh ohhhhhh) oh oh oh oh ohh

[Hook]
With you is where i'd rather be
But we're stuck where we are
And its so hard
You're so far
This long distance is killin me
I wish that you were here with me
But we're stuck where we are
And its so hard
You're so far
This long distance is killin me

[Hook]
Its so hard, its so hard
Where we are, where we are
You're so far
This long distance is killin me
Its so hard, its so hard
Where we are, where we are
You're so far
This long distance is killin me

[Outro]
There's only so many songs that I can sing to pass the time
T.I

I mean forgive me for being so straightforward but it’s beena minute since I’ve been here
And umm, I mean if you will just take a second to look around man
You know what I’m saying, it’s a bunch of shit
And I know you don’t do this often but I’m the exception
Do it for me huh, pop that pussy for a real nigga ma
Lets go

Say bruh, I’m so official outta sight
What’s about me not to like
I put that pipe inside her like my diamonds are her guiding light
I’m dynamite, K-I-N-G P-I-M-P, admire me
A plethora of fan freaks trailing right behind me
Killer shit, turn a clug to a crime scene
Pocket full of money like I run a crime ring
Million dollar chain, everything shining
It’s safe to say I do my thing honey, nah mean
Bunch of young ?, no Chinese
And been stuck together like they siamese
A friendly rub, way to feel her, she say “God leave”
I say I’m tryna touch her hard, close ya eyes, breathe
Now she running from me, but she ain't tryna leave
I keep a quarter key of ? thats a nine piece
Legs open curtain closed, rock solid hurting hoes
Buss it open, sure she will, who else is there to do it for
Fo’sho

[Verse One]
Yo, this is Action Bronsonelli in the place to be

Peace to the ultimate warrior posted up in Astoria
Bronsolini is the name and when I rhyme its euphoria
To the death of me, motherfuckers seeking that serum
I got the recipe, soft shell crabs right out the Chesapeake
The devil's basil laying lovely in the plastic jar
Open it up from the aroma almost crashed that car
New York livin', linen shorts we too horse driven
And when we sitting down to dine at least there's two course swimming
Probably calamari, my young shooter I call him Gallinari
Still serve the Knicks, nibbles of parmigiani
Hand-craft the cheeses, aged inside the cave to thaw
Off to my tailor alterations for my days in court
Come to the park with my jump shot, got five bets
I'm on price, deadly in the clutch with the precision of a shark bite
After that we split the paper up and spark the pepper flakes
Flying to the heights, Dominican buffet for pepper steaks
You know its Queensbridge you hear the flavour of my music
My brother Lonny manoeuvre huggin' knotties in the Buick, fluid
Close-knit, no shit just like a herringbone
And laid over the sweater of many brothers of 

[?]
My aura glistening, my shit's official in
And for my platter's three stars, the book of Michelin
Study Ju-Jitsu in, closets of crystalline
I'm known to rock the green ballys straight out of switzerland, Peace
My facial hair better than Tom Selleck, smoke the bomb tree
Under the palm tree, accent mimicking Connery
Pardon me lady, slow roasted animal smothered in gravy
Flow like the navy, you play me, then you snoring with daisy
Bronsolinio, the motherfucking number one rap singer
The number one rap singer in the universe
Cause I'm the master of the universe, call me He-Man
Mister songwriter, Bronsolini, Bronsolinio
Bronsonolski, Action Bronstein, George Bronstein
Action Castanza

She wants them Ray Bands cause them bands are gorgeous

Ever since she saw me on the Forbes list

They're Zorros with horses
That's mustangs and porsches imported from Japan
She from Atlanta but she on that Cali strain
That's that overseas money, call 'em Taliban(ds)
She WMD, all year spring to winter
So pencil her in for breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner
Ain't no incidentals
She want them bands like a freelance parade (All day)

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Uh
Ugh, haha, it's ill
Ugh
Uh

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Who the coldest motherfucker in the room?
(Who the coldest motherfucker in the room?)
Who the coldest motherfucker in the room?
(Who the coldest motherfucker in the room?)
And who the coldest motherfucker that you know? (Yeah)
(Who the coldest motherfucker that you know?)
Bring him round here, he's gettin' froze
(He's gettin' froze, he's gettin' froze)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Roll it up, let's smoke
And tell me why your bitch look like Glenn Close
I'm on my own two, that's ten toes
First the bullets fly, somebody says, "Go" (Go)
Why you bent low when your Jordans' retro?
Girls playin' games for the bills, they Drew Bledsoe (Woah)
There's a lot that you can buy, but I'll never own
And a lot of information that I'll never know
Learn 'til they get concerned for my sanity
A life that's filled with vanity needs a little clarity (Clarity)
This the truth, this a taste, can you handle it?
A million dollars couldn't cover up the damages
Naked girl at the crib makin' sandwiches (Uh-huh)
And when we makin' love, I got a candle lit (Uh-huh)
Some romantic shit to put her in the mood
The world woke me up, now I'm lookin' at the snooze (What to do?)

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Curren$y]
Who the coldest motherfucker in the room?
Who the coldest motherfucker in the room?
And who the coldest motherfucker that you know? (Turn it up, Sam)
Bring him round here, he's gettin' froze (Yo)

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Life, look at my hands, I'm the lord of the rings (Lord of the rings)
Musical cocaine brought me all of these Carrera keys
Soft top goin' hard on the block, freeze that talk
And that plot about walkin' up on me
No security, just my homies, the well-dressed army
Presidential arm piece, my credentials: I'm a G
All access, Jets wherever you won't be
Snatch that 'vette for my mans the day of his prison release
Shoe was on the other foot, I know he would've done the same thing for me
But we'll let that be
Park it in the spot right next to my B with the chrome wings
I was sent here to own things
Both sides of the court, colder than the airport
Therefore I'm the one them hoes here for, yeah, what?

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Who the coldest motherfucker in the room?
Who the coldest motherfucker in the room?
And who the coldest motherfucker that you know?
Bring him round here, he's gettin' froze (Yo)

[Outro: Mac Miller]
And another one

[Hook]
She love me up and lay me down!
She love me up and lay me down!
She love me up and lay me down!

Do it baby, stick it, stick it babygirl!

Do it baby, stick it, stick it babygirl!

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I said, get right, but you know what I got
Got them fixing up they make-up when I walk up in the spot
Got they eye shadow on and they lips on shine
With a smile on her face, when her lips on mine
See I'm a big freak, feed her big peter
Beat that pussy up so good she don't want me to eat her
First I meet her then I beat her, whatever she need
A few of these turn a nigga wifey to a cheater
Keep her head down and her ass up here
Got her hair fucked up and her lipstick smeared
Take a city bitch here or a bitch from the boonies
Wit a man at the crib but he don't know what he doing, hold up
Truefully she knew she do me, but she knew me
Introduce me and she blew me, but she didn't say nothing to me
You don't like it then sue me, she my biggest fan now
When I spend a day in town, then she hurry up and lay me down Down!

[Hook]
She love me up and lay me down!
Ay what she do?
She love me up and lay me down!
Ay what she do?
She love me up and lay me down!
She get me up
I love it when she lay me down!
Do it baby stick it (down)
Do it baby stick it (down)
Do it baby, stick it, stick it babygirl!
Do it baby stick it (down)
Do it baby stick it (down)
Do it baby, stick it, stick it babygirl!

[Verse 2: T.I.]
On the hush hush, keep it low key
Attitude in check, cause you with a O.G
Got that thing on lock, wanna see the door key
Got dope dick, give it to her til she O.D
I'm a put it in her in the life, give her what she missin
She yo wife well she off limits, well that is unless you slipping
And I catch her on a mission in my hotel lobby
Trying to run into somebody, end up at the after party
With a stripper body, itty bitty waist
Big ol' booty begging me to decorate her pretty face (ok)
Hey, what can I say? She requested and I deliver
Broad looking for that raw, shawty I'm that nigga
Ain't playin witcha, full of Remy high sober
You catch me in your city lick me up I bend you over
Know the women want me and niggas think its the money
But she should be paying me though, it's the dick she gettin from me, from me
All in yo tummy when

[Hook]
She love me up and lay me down!
Ay what she do?
She love me up and lay me down!
Ay what she do?

Pop that thing girl
Pop, pop, pop that thing girl
Stick it baby girl!
Pop that thing girl
Pop, pop, pop that thing girl! (hold up)
Turn the lights on!

[Verse 1]
Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score, on and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore?

[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on

[Verse 2]
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance, on and on
Does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on

[Bridge]
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday, grow but never die
I can fly, my friends

[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show

[Verse 3]
I'll top the bill
I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the show
Show must go on
Show must go on

[Verse 1]
I've just seen a face I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met, she's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Mmm-mmm-mmm-m'mmm-mmm

[Verse 2]
Had it been another day I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her tonight
Di-di-di-di'n'di

[Chorus]
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again

[Verse 3]
I have never known the like of this I've been alone
And I have missed things and kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite like this
Da-da-n'da-da'n'da

[Chorus]
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again

[Verse 1]
I've just seen a face I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met, she's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Mmm-mmm-mmm-da-da-da

[Chorus]
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again

[Outro]
Oh, fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again

[Verse 1]
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Verse 2]
Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Bridge]
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

[Verse 3]
You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere

[Bridge]
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

[Verse 4]
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Outro]
Yeah, oh, baby, you've changed
Ah, I'm looking through you
Yeah, I'm looking through you
You changed, you changed, you changed, you changed

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

[Outro: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

[Intro: DJ Drama]
You see
We dream chase cause that's all we was given to start with
Then we realized the dream was obtainable
Now look at us
M-M-Maybach Music

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Counting money all I seem to hear is Benji talking
Hater we ain't conversatin' it's just semis talking
Used to be the boy
They said they have a penny on 'em
Now I walk around with twenty chains with like a milli on em
Lace up my boots, put on my strap
And go lookin' for that paper I'm like "where it's at?"
They lookin' at, I'm staring back (I see you)
Feelin' like I'm superman
Every time I wear this mac
Monday, it's probably 106 & park
Tuesday, probably in the hood where it get dark
Wednesday, Probably catch me swimming with the sharks
With blood dripping from my shoes, these Loub's cooler than my heart

[Break: DJ Drama]
See dream chasing is an occupation
Those with the job understand the process of manifestation
Your dream starts as a thought
Then its nurtured, achieved, and sustained
Then we go back into our minds for more

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Let me out my cell, right back on the mission
Fresh from off a bail, right back in the kitchen
Who the fuck gon' pay my lawyer
I got booked with this Sig Sawyer
And like eighty grams of crack
He said the feds probably come for ya
I'm like "oh lord!"
Copper said I tried to kill em when I go to court
I hope they dont find me guilty, it's my word against they word
And I won't get a chance to speak
I caught my case with nine of my niggas, and I'm the only one they beat
I took it for the team
Even though I had a dream like Martin Luther King
Who thought that I'd be cover of these magazines
Cause I be spitting fire flow, I'm kerosene
Lemme talk to em
Fuck y'all niggas gon' say about me?
My North niggas they don't play about me
South Philly niggas that'll spray about me
Pay q million dollar bail in a day about me
Ain't gotta sound real, cause they'll tell you that
I'm on the top floor, I started where the cellar at
Self Made, bitches

[Outro: DJ Drama]
I had a dream one time
It was, I was gonna make a lotta money doing what I wanted to do
I went after it and it was a struggle to achieve
But you know what?
I caught that bitch!
Dreamchasers!
This is where dreams become reality

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I once had a girl
Or should I say, she once had me?
She showed me her room
"Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?"

[Bridge 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I sat on the rug
Biding my time, drinking her wine
We talked until two
And then she said, "It's time for bed"

[Bridge 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
And when I awoke
I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?

[Intro]
Wow
I think I must have forgot or something
Like I ain't hot or something
Like I don't make your girl take off her top or something

[Chorus]
I'm like
Hahahaha
LMAO
Hahahaha
LMAO
Laugh at the haters in here
I'll be her favorite in years
She wanna play play
But, what more can I say say?

[Verse 1]
Jump in the coup and I'm gone
I smell like money, I don't need no cologne
I just need me a freak
That can jump on the bone
Like an X-Ray technician
My rectangular prism
Says money sex then drugs
All cause I'm 21
Like playing blackjack
Picture this kodak
Moment forever
K.Dot that dude
She sucked my dick and got frostbite
I'm that cool

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a pocket full of checks
Plus I'm bouncing through the club
With a crazy two-step
And diamonds on my neck
Ziploc fresh
Ziploc fresh
Hoes wanna play play
What more can I say say?

[Chorus]
I'm like
Hahahaha
LMAO
Hahahaha
LMAO
Laugh at the haters in here
I'll be her favorite in years
She wanna play play
But, what more can I say say?

[Verse 2]
Bottle of goose and I'm gone
Watching her get loose
Like a third graders tooth
The shit that we on
Is the ultimate high
Double XL flow
That's the ultimate vibe
Park that Lambi' outside
Just to fuck with the haters
Put the Lami' in drive
Watch 'em peel like potatoes
Holla' LMAO
When they drunk and two-step
Like I never could pass
A sobriety test

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a pocket full of checks
Plus I'm bouncing through the club
With a crazy two-step
And diamonds on my neck
Ziploc fresh
Ziploc fresh
Hoes wanna play play
What more can I say say?

[Chorus]
I'm like
Hahahaha
LMAO
Hahahaha
LMAO
Laugh at the haters in here
I'll be her favorite in years
She wanna play play
But, what more can I say say?

[Verse 3]
I'm in the club I can manage
Providing lenses
Make my view panoramic
I'm out of this world
I'm off of this planet
They don't say K.Dot is here
They say his spaceship has landed
And your access has been granted
Like a kitchen floor
But my floor is marble
I ride in the carpool because I got two whores
In the back of that chrome
See they're all I need
Like Aaliyah alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I got a pocket full of checks
Plus I'm bouncing through the club
With a crazy two-step
And diamonds on my neck
Ziploc fresh
Ziploc fresh
Hoes wanna play play
What more can I say say?

[Chorus]
I'm like
Hahahaha
LMAO
Hahahaha
LMAO
Laugh at the haters in here
I'll be her favorite in years
She wanna play play
But, what more can I say say?

[Verse 1]
When I call you up, your line's engaged
I have had enough, so act your age
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind

[Chorus]
If you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)

[Verse 2]
I don't know why you should want to hide
(Ooh, la la la, ooh, la la la)
But I can't get through, my hands are tied
(Ooh, la la la, ooh, la la la)
I won't want to stay, I don't have much to say
(Ooh, la la la, ooh, la la la)
But I get turned away (Ooh, la la la)

[Chorus]
And you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)

[Bridge]
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing

[Verse 3]
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
(Ooh, la la la, ooh, la la la)
And since I lost you, it feels like years
(Ooh, la la la, ooh, la la la)
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
(Ooh, la la la, ooh, la la la)
And I just can't go on (Ooh, la la la)

[Chorus]
If you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)

[Bridge]
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing

[Verse 3]
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
(Ooh, la la la, ooh, la la la)
And since I lost you, it feels like years
(Ooh, la la la, ooh, la la la)
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
(Ooh, la la la, ooh, la la la)
And I just can't go on (Ooh, la la la)

[Chorus]
If you won't see me (You won't see me)
You won't see me (You won't see me)

[Outro]
(Yeah) Ooh, la la la (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh, la la la

[Verse 1]
I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes

[Chorus]
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

[Verse 2]
I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you have in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery

[Chorus]
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

[Verse 3]
Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should

[Chorus]
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

[Outro]
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you

[Verse 1]
Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love

[Bridge 1]
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now I've got it, the word is good

[Verse 2]
Spread the word and you'll be free
Spread the word and be like me
Spread the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love

[Bridge 2]
Everywhere I go I hear it said
In the good and the bad books that I have read

[Verse 3]
Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love

[Bridge 3]
Now that I know what I feel must be right
I'm here to show everybody the light

[Verse 4]
Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
It's the word I'm thinking of
And the only word is love
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love

[Outro]
Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, love

[Verse 1]
I get high when I see you go by
My, oh, my
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?

[Chorus]
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

[Verse 2]
Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up, girl?

[Chorus]
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

[Outro]
Yes, it's so hard loving you, loving you

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much, it makes you sorry
Still, you don't regret a single day

[Chorus: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison]
Ah, girl
Girl, girl

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the Earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why

[Chorus: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison]
Ah, girl
Girl, girl

[Bridge: John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
She's the kind of girl who puts you down (Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
When friends are there, you feel a fool (Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
(Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
When you say she's looking good (Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
She acts as if it's understood (Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh (Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)

[Chorus: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison]
Girl
Girl, girl

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?

[Chorus: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison]
Ah, girl
Girl, girl

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison]
Ah, girl
Girl, girl

[Verse 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain

[Chorus 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

[Verse 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

[Chorus 2: John Lennon with Paul McCartney]
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

[Piano Solo]

[Chorus 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

[Outro: John Lennon]
In my life, I love you more

[Verse 1: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone

[Chorus 1: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

[Verse 2: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay

[Chorus 2: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be
And if you do, I'll trust in you
And know that you will wait for me

[Verse 3: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone

[Chorus: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be
And if you do, I'll trust in you
And know that you will wait for me

[Verse 4: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay

[Chorus: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried

[Verse 5: John Lennon and Paul McCartney]
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Well I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or I won't know where I am

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Well you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life
Trying just to make you toe the line

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Let this be a sermon
I mean everything I've said
Baby, I'm determined
And I'd rather see you dead

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

[Verse 4: John Lennon]
I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or you won't know where I am

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl

[Outro: John Lennon]
Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Hating is a weak emotion
A sign of failure

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Nigga stop your hating, get off your ass
Worrying about the next nigga, that’ll cost your ass
Go get on your grind nigga and off the pad
Slow grind until the top, but you’re falling fast

You can hate on me
Hate is my motivator
Boyyy

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Hate on me I volunteer
Lowest points, man I been there
Locked up on the toppest tier
Trying to get up out of there
This the home where failure from
Future I’ll fly up out of here
Some of us gonna make it, homie
Some niggas gonna die in here
Yea, but ain’t no hate gonna get you out of here
Niggas hating on me, I approach them dudes without a fear
Hating niggas never prosper, hating gotta stop you there
Niggas that made it to the top, start hating then got dropped from there
Yea, get the money nigga, why hate?
No time for hating, only money on my mind stay
Shit I ain’t with it if it can’t go on my mom's plate
Hating is the leading cause of killings and the crime rate
Yea, they my motivators though
I be smiling in they face even while I know they hating though
Every chance I see I’m ‘a take because I know what they waiting for
They waiting on the day I fall, but hate won’t work at all

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Nigga stop your hating, get off your ass
Worrying about the next nigga, that’ll cost your ass
Go get on your grind nigga and off the pad
Slow grind up to the top, but you’re falling fast

You can hate on me
Hate is my motivator
Boyyy

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Lebron ain’t make it to the NBA from hating
He made it from dedication, ambition and motivation
Addition to what they saying
Niggas voicing opinions
Them niggas can only judge me the judgment day of my ending
They judge me from the beginning
Hate it though, but it’s cool though
They giving gas to my engine, adding fire to fuel
I’m flyer than all these dudes
They see it that’s why they hate
I’m grinding because I’m shining, they grinding ‘cause they at state
I’m grinding because I’ve gotta, my bills they gotta get paid
And Tweety, he gotta eat, he wore Pradas like every day
My momma live in the hood and they chopping whichever way
Ain’t no hating gonna solve my problems so why would I even hate?
I’m gonna get it
That’s word to Robby, and my Aunt Terry
Some of my homies haters, that’s why I keep them near me
And when they hating on me, it feel like they cheering
Haters is my motivator, hate on me, I dare them

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Nigga stop your hating, get off your ass
Worrying about the next nigga, that’ll cost your ass
Go get on your grind nigga, and off the pad
Slow grind until the top, but you’re falling fast

You can hate on me
Hate is my motivator
Boyyy

[Outro: Meek Mill]
Hating is a weak emotion, sign of failure
Puffin on that purple, same color as Donatello
That hating gonna lead to your demise I’m trying to tell you, son

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
A couple more commas richer
And I'm still mobbing with my niggas, bruh

Nigga, suck a dick, swag, swag, A$AP

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Toot that shoot that Glock 9, jiggy nigga I'm 'bout mine

[Outro]
Aye, young nigga, aye, young blood
Don't let these niggas box you in, nigga, just cause you gettin' rich
Dont forget where you came from and who you really are, man
Talking 'bout you ignorant, nigga, you young, nigga
Woke up in New York City lying on the floor
Just outside of Marcy's - West 54 "wow"
You gonna know my name by the end of the night "well"
You gonna know my name by the end of the night "well"

Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head

Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head

Came down somebody else
I know it ain´t right
But its all in my head
Wow I'm surprised
I'm still alive I should be dead

Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head

Look nigga I'm the rawest, the mu'fuckin' animal
Want war? One phone call is how I handle you (whew)
On the grind, you pussy nigga's hate
Bitch I'm out in different states, politic'n, and gettin cake
Fill my lungs with the best weed, pockets with them dollar signs
Run with them niggas holdin Glocks like it's columbine (pop, pop, pop)
I'm a star, ain't a choice so I gotta shine
Far as Pittsburgh, I'm the voice so I gotta rhyme
Grind all the time ever since the first day
Now I'm gettin cake like everyday became my birthday
Something like an earthquake, the way this shit drop
I be at the tip top posted with a big knot
You ain't know ho you sit at home and just watch
Less then haters, stone cold spectating
Same lame's turn out to be investigators
No where near comfortable need extra paper

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa] (x2)
Got the city on smash, the streets on lock
A hundred real niggas with their heats on cock
Got my pockets on swole still need more gwap
Plus the hood say they love to hear the young boy talk

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Ay, ay
The jeans spent about a buck 45 on them
If he trick the team, buck 45's on him
When we hit the scene, the club hoes just pile on him
You scrubs show them groupies love, I just style on them
Seen me and my guys, blow a couple thou' on em
But don't trip I'm with a clique that's know to wild stump ya
Fuck around dump ya
You ain't heard, we in the Burgh
Nigga's put they gun down, fuck around, jump ya
Leave ya slump with ya block knocked off
I be ridin, something classic with the top dropped off
Roll the weed in the Rillo
I made it out of nothing, around them thieves and offenders
Ride with keys in they fenders
Now we all big spenders
You could ask about them they don't know it's me
Cuz you smell dro, blow about a elbow
This shit is fun for me, I been eatin
You niggas dumb hungry, I dear one of you to come for me

[Hook]
Hook:
From the cradle to the grave nigga

Tattoos on my face, that's why people think I'm crazy
But Gucci Mane the realest and all that other shit fugazi
Hundred K a day shit

You can't wear my shoes unless you make millions every month bitch
Millions every month, bitch
Millions every month, bitch
You can't fill my shoes unless you make millions every month bitch

Verse 1 - V-Nasty:

(Hook)


Verse 2 - Gucci Mane:
Cold hearted like a motherfuckin' cobra

Brick looks like a nigga froze up utopia
Niggas ain't eatin' like the kids in Ethipoia
I know you wanna get me and my money be provoking ya
Time to change your mind, and make your job as boob of Tokyo
Sucka tell no lies and he puffin' that Pinnochio
Still screaming free Boosie my nigga free Papa Joe
Hotter than a hula dancer, colder than an eskimo
If you think you're testin' me, you better eat the both of us
Grab you by by your collar, but I hang you by your testicles
Snitchin' ass nigga know the police was protecting you

[Ninja]:
Everybody go, "ho!" like a Thundercat
I'm all up in the club in my underpants
No shirt on cause it's fokken hot
Let's go, Diplo, pump it up!
Girls wanna say hello to me

Lookin' at you lookin' back, who can that be?
When I'm all up in this
Bitch, you know who the fuck it is
Roll through the club like a tokoloshe;

Yo-Landi Vi$$er so fancy like this dope-ass beat;
Rock the motherfuckin' microphone with no panties
I'm a bad ass chick, yo: my black magic
Spelletjies make all the boys go, "damn, that's sick"
Lie down on the bed, boy, let me light the candles
Uh-uh, don't touch, Yo-Landi just too hot to handle
Blindfold you, lock your hands up with the handcuffs
Even though you lying down, I can make you stand up
Spirits in the room tickle you like a sneaky prawn
Fuck a pen and pad, I write my rhymes with a Ouija board
Draw a pentagram on your chest with my lipstick
Visions in the mirror: heavy Zef futuristic
Let me take your pants off. Let's see what you made of
Go through your pockets - no, we not gonna make love
Go through your wallet, whoa! Look at all this paper!
What a fuckin' sucker. See you later, masturbator

[Ninja/(Yo-Landi Vi$$er)]:
I went from fokol to so fokken hot right now, i'll put you in your place!
Motherfucker, skrik wakker, we coming through, pumping you full of bass!
Fok rustig, eks apokaliptikal, (fucking you in the face!)
Zef cherries tioon my, "spieg my fokken hol nat"
Fuck everyone, eyes on the prize when I go for the jugular
Surprise me or fokof and die when I remind you of how much you suck!
Everyone's so fokken so-so (yo, we've been sent to fuck you up!)
Zef techno mosh-pit gangsta nommer een kind
Everything you rap about comes true if you got some freakin' balls
But mind your tongue when you rhyme on the drum; gaan vra vir Biggie Smalls
I gotta rock if you motherfucking like it or not (yo, is you ready for)
This hostile take over? bow to the fokken master
My slang is banging, I'm freaking the fuck out of myself! yo, I'm my biggest fan
Cause, buddy, when you man down, no fokken hands out when you really need a hand
Machine gun rapper (lekker budda-budda, motherfucker) yo, I'm bigger than

[Yo-Landi Vi$$er]:

[Verse 1]
Gin in my cup, so I ain't so sober
Girl on my dick, call me Cassanova
Ribs are broken, My name is Oprah
My girl talk too but she deal in chocha.'
Got the gold top like I'm one of the Brady's
Birthday shit on the side, get that quick Mercedes
'Scuse me ladies! I know you wanna shoot me
Like my name's Jay Brady, but the cameras pay me
I wanna eat good Iike Rachael Ray
Pop tags on shoes on the 8th of May
My voice too high 'sposed to hold me back
They say the same fucking thing cause I'm young and black
Opposites attract
So not far from me is white dude with low voice and no money
Who gives a fuck if my voice sound funny
Fuck friends, I got me a bi-buddy
I'm true life Iike I'm MTV
Hollywood like a six time three
I been goin' so crisp, get dressed in a fly ass t-shirt
Nike so tight they make your fuckin' feet hurt
Jealous ass niggas when they see you rollin'
Same motherfucker on Ceezie’s scrotum
My sneeks so bright, and my girls so thick
Money so big call me Ceezie's dick

[Chorus]
Calling all haters all across the world it's a (red alert)
It's a (red alert), it's a
Calling all haters all across the world it's a (red alert)

[Verse 2]
I shine so bright they should call me sunlight
Call me punk rock cause my jeans is too tight
Diesel boo boo, Michael jacket
Got one e'ry week, it's a nasty habit
Date eights and up, that my standard
Show 'em who's boss like Tony Danza
Take it across state get the nasty plate
With my bootleg sex, why masturbate
It's the dude from the hood that you love to hate
'Cause I got new shoes and I love to skate
Me and Lupe got it kick push
To show these pussy ass niggas why we fuck they bush
I used to have to sweep floors just to make the ends meet
The ends meetin' like a motherfucker. Ain't that sweet?
Why I'm deep with the kids like Phish on myspace
Now I'm on your fish scales like I hang with Ghostface
They say black don't crack, except for Whitney
My shit don't crack, I fall off like Britney
To put it simply, I lose my balance
Cause I got a pink drink and it makes me tipsy
Live the high life, make the full price
You want my advice to get the five mics
You wanna put them fake ass guns away
Nah, I'm just kiddin' nigga, you ain't got a chance anyway

[Chorus]
Calling all haters all across the world it's a (red alert)
It's a (red alert), it's a
Calling all haters all across the world it's a (red alert)

[Verse 1]
There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbeque
This a hickey or a bruise?

[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

[Chorus]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-whoa

[Post-Chorus]
But this Friday night, do it all again
But this Friday night, do it all again

[Verse 2]
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

[Chorus]
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops

Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois

Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-whoa

But this Friday night, do it all again (Do it all again)
This Friday night, do it all again
(Do it all again) This Friday night

Ever ran into a chick that said that she was mixed with something else?
And you're like, please stop, stop, stop
But she looking so right, and her body so tight
Got you at the bar drinking, buying her drinks all night
Clubs 'bout to let out and now you're drunk
Now she leaving the club with me, sorry you've been punked
Believe me I know, listen to the remix professor
See homie before you tip her, first you must undress her
Cause this is how a real playa do
Tell me, do I have to sound like a broken record record record record

12..Goofy, You give her your number,says shes gonna call but you never see her again

(Chorus)

Calm it down now, calm it down now
Calm it down now, calm it down now
Cause that was a freestyle, cause that was a freestyle
That was a freestyle, that was a freestyle
Now, just imagine if I had to sat my ass down and
Took my time and really wrote it (wrote it) Oh

[Verse 1]
Well as this cold world, turns round and round
So much tragedy, have I found
If I could take it away, I'd do that now
'Cause only in my dreams, can I smile

[Chorus]
So if I go to sleep, don't wake me up
'Cause only in my dreams
Can I fly away
Can I fly away
Can I fly away
Can I fly away
Fly away

[Verse 2]
So God bless my soul
The pain I feel won't nobody know
'Cause this world is evil
And everytime I wake up I wanna go home
So what am I to do?
But sing a song for you
'Cause I feel you also
That's why I'll never let you go
They say I lost my mind, but I did that so long ago
So when I close my eyes, leave me alone

[Chorus]
So if I go to sleep, don't wake me up
'Cause only in my dreams
Can I fly away
Can I fly away
Can I fly away
Can I fly away
Fly away

[Verse 3]
Uh, somebody pray for me
I believe I can fly, yeah, crazy me
But at night these angels be singing to me
Like "la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la"
So as I lay awake at night
I drift away into the sky
And that's where I reside
Oh yeah, oh yeah
So pray that I'll be just fine
I'll see you when it's time
I'll see you when it's time

[Chorus]
So if I go to sleep, don't wake me up
'Cause only in my dreams
Can I fly away
Can I fly away
Can I fly away
Can I fly away
Fly away
So if I go to sleep, don't wake me up
'Cause only in my dreams
Can I fly away
Can I fly away
Can I fly away
Can I fly away
Fly away

[Outro]
So much tragedy, have I found

[Verse 1]
Lace up your Timbs, Queens, fresh off the blacktop
Off Broadway recital, fiends on the backlot
Back alley Bronson always cookin' up a mad plot
The shit that have us laid in Benzes with a glass top
Hash pot, stickin' out the dash spot
I'll leave a bitch in a vacant and let his ass rot
174 and autobahn is where the cash drop
Then take the paper, then distribute to the have-nots
I'm on the scene, 26, and I'm a manchild
Long machete, hopping out the van style
Whether fightin' or graffiti, got them hand styles
I'll wipe the floor up with your face like a ShamWow
Hands down, one motherfucker
260 combined, here to bring the ruckus
The bassline plus the words raise the crime rate
Bronsolini show 'em how to hold a 9 straight

[Hook]
Yo, get off the next man's P.P
Be original, kid, get off the P.P
Get off the shaft of my dick, get off the P.P
Yo, be original, kid, get off the P.P

[Verse 2]
Yo, the drugs are rolled up, the money fold up
I love my bitches big-body like an old truck
With their waists sliced thin just like the cold cuts
Been at the bottom of the sea, but then I rose up
Feet first, my voice is known to curl a honey's toes
Serve a pound of that, I'll leave 'em with a bloody nose
Smoke the hash, takin form just like it's putty, holmes
Hop in the Caddy, leave your body by a muddy road
A dirty rotten scoundrel like Steve Martin
Drugs so good, Fiend Weekly just three-starred 'em
I'm on the road, blow trees through East Harlem
Just put me in a cage in the basement, I'm retarded
German shift, twist, burn the bliss
I love it when the pussy tighter than a tourniquet
Copped the chicken, started cookin' and converted it
Dutch leaf, third of it, roll it up, murder it

[Hook]
Yo, get off the next man's P.P
Be original, kid, get off the P.P
Get off the shaft of my dick, get off the P.P
Yo, be original, kid, get off the P.P

[Intro: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
There's a place so dark, you can't see the end
(Skies cock back) And shock that which can't defend
The rain then sends dripping acidic questions
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then with the eyes shut, lookin' through the rust and rot, and dust
A small spot of light floods the floor
And pours over the rusted world of pretend
And the eyes ease open, and it's dark again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the memory, you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Movin' all around, screamin' of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
The wheels go round and the sunset creeps
Behind street lamps, chain-link, and concrete
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn
Floats on down the street 'til the wind is gone
And the memory now is like the picture was then
When the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)
From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top, I stop)
At the core, I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the memory, you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda with Chester Bennington]
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act, you bring the thought back
Tellin' you that I see it right through you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In the memory, you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
In the memory, you will find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

[Intro: Gerry O'Driscoll]
...and I am not frightened of dying, you know
Any time will do, I don't mind
Why should I be frightened of dying?
There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime

[Lyricless vocals: Clare Torry]

[Bridge: Patricia Watts]
I never said I was afraid of dying

[Lyricless vocals: Clare Torry]

[Intro]
Folks, we have a very special guest for you tonight
I'd like to introduce...
Mr. Hahn

Let's hear it for the great (Mr. Hahn)

And now for a lesson in rhythm management
Let's begin

Alright now, wasn't that fun?
Let's try something else

[Verse One: Action Bronson]
(This that beautiful shit)
She got the bathwater running, honey smelling like some almond milk
Lavender and cocoa nib, hop on a pogo stick
Don’t mind her, she’s only here for taking photos, shit
Unless you wanted to jump in all on the low, low
I love your pussy lips, the fatness and the shape of ‘em
And plus they got a little shake to them, many times forsaken ‘em
Improper use had led you to the doctor many times
In the past year, keep the flask near
Drink away the sorrows, reaching for tomorrow
Dip out of the country with this time that I have borrowed
Never to return again but you could write me with the feather
To my number one fan, I love you Heather

[Hook: Macie Stewart]
You’ve got me feeling so fine
And I can hardly find the time, yeah
Tomorrow’s so far down the line
So sit yourself down and unwind

[Verse Two: Rockie Fresh]
This year, I took a hundred flights
Which mean my girl cried a hundred nights
Hundred groupie hoes I gave the pipe
But I still found time to get my paper right
Big money on it, tell ‘em go and count the pile
Man I swear to God this life is wild
You be creative and they take your style
Lot of bitches out here lame, they just in denial
We keep it cool but she hot as hell, we make it melt
She got me living with a feeling that I never felt
And every day we smoke the dopest dope that has been dealt
I had to leave because I’m getting booked just like a show
She told me I’m a learn that some people ain’t worth the help
And you show them the ropes, they go and hang they self
And I gotta listen to anything that Heather say
I gotta stay shining, don’t wanna see Heather gray
Aye

[Hook: Macie Stewart]
You’ve got me feeling so fine
And I can hardly find the time, yeah
Tomorrow’s so far down the line
So sit yourself down and unwind

[Hook]
When I wake up from a full night of sleep
I put my best foot forward indeed
And as the colors begin to sing
They seem to say to me, "come on"
Come on, come on, come on, you gotta put me on
Come on, come on, come on, you gotta put me on
Come on, come on, come on, you gotta put me on
Come on, come on, come on, you gotta put me on

[Verse 1]
Ever since I first arrived here
I've been on the run like an eye tear
And it took me a while to get my life steered
But now I'm in the moment, while I reside here
Yup, that's why I coordinate with my gear
So you can feel the feng shui as soon as I'm near
Yeah, and people have the nerve to say that I'm weird
But you just in a box, so get your mind cleared
Yeah, yeah, that good music, man, we got it here
So we can get the vibe high like a light gear
Or maybe, fly high like five deer
Call me Santa Claus, when I come through I gotta put 'em on

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Well, ever since I was eleven
I have found heaven in my self expression
Huh, no, my childhood I never left it
Yes, I'm still a big kid though I never stress it
Yet, memory is evanescent
So I make moves with a special method
That allow my dreams to be manifested
So you're past the promised land, no, I can't accept it
This life I lead is a very blessed one
So, that's why fans have many questions
Yet, I still leave many guessing
I'm an artist, so I gotta have a bad collection
I put 'em on (I put 'em on)

[Hook x2]

[Intro]

[heartbeat]

[Spoken: Chris Adamson, Gerry O'Driscoll, Peter Watts, and Clare Torry]
I've been mad for fucking years
Absolutely years, been over the edge for yonks
Been working me buns off for bands
I've always been mad, I know I've been mad
Like the most of us have
Very hard to explain why you're mad
Even if you're not mad
Hahahahahahaha! Hehehehehehehe!
Ah-ah-ah...

Shout out to all the ladies

Behavin’ like a maven, I'm crazy crazy crazy
I rise to the occasion ’cause raging’s my occupation
Shouts out to my Haitians my Asians and my Caucasians
Latina señorita es muy caliente
They say I’m amazing but, really it's amazing
Today's world the craziest to make the main page
Just to be a daily topic of a conversation
Kutta’s on the beat so I guess its an operation
So call me Dr. Bob yes I’m on the job
She say I’m like a teacher before she lights my yard
Stick to the script take a shit in your draws
And I don't need to take you number girl this ain't no casting call

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yes she give it to me cuz she know just how I want it
And if this where we battle we would be worthy opponents
I had to get up on it, kinda how you do a pony
It's kinda like a bank 'cause she knows she wants to loan it
Shout out to my gangsta who get down in Atlanta
Wassup to Magic City, this here should be your anthem
So throw it on back cuz I want that butt
I'ma still be hear when the sun comes up
When the sun comes up who’ll still be here
With ball and a bat give me one more plaque
So I guess I might as well turn things up
I’ma burn things up like the purp you puff
Tryna get loose she poppin that coo
But when she get through she goin serve things up
All the bad girls in the building just shake it
One time if ya feel it now
I ain't really trippin bout yo homegirls with ya
I'ma bring you home with 'em and she gob' get it
Lay up, ho, but I dont really want no more
But I'ma just go fast like a baseball throw
Fast like a kenco show

In the paint no mo’ I'ma take it straight to the hole
Hell yeah, she know she bad, she so bad

[Hook]

[Verse: Roger Waters]
All that you touch and all that you see
All that you taste, all you feel
And all that you love and all that you hate
All you distrust, all you save
And all that you give (all you give) and all that you deal
And all that you buy, beg, borrow, or steal (Hey-ey)
And all you create and all you destroy (Ooooh)
And all that you do and all that you say (Heeeey-yeah)
And all that you eat and everyone you meet (Everyone you meet)
And all that you slight and everyone you fight (Hooooo)
And all that is now and all that is gone
And all that's to come and everything under the sun is in tune (Everything)
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon

[Outro]
There is no dark side in the moon really
Matter of fact it's all dark
*Heartbeat*

[Intro/Bridge]
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work

[Verse 1]
Diamonds all on my ring nigga
Gold watches, gold chain nigga
Hundred thou' on champagne nigga
Yeah my money insane nigga
Yeah I'm making it rain nigga
But I was just on the plane nigga
Buying gear, flying here
Fuck what you heard, it’s my time of year
If I'm in the club, I get a hundred stacks
I'm always rolling up so I get love for that
Them niggas stole my swag but I don't want it back
My nigga uh! I was on this, but now I'm onto that
You see it in my closet before it's on the rack
Was out there in Hawaii, now I'm goin back
My nigga uh! I got so much money I should start a bank
So much paper right in front of me it's hard to think
Buy so many bottles it's gon' be hard to drink
But I'm still pourin' up and my family here and they rolling up so uh!

[Hook]
The bigger the bill, the harder you ball
Well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long
The quicker you here, the faster you go
That's why where I come from the only thing we know is..
The bigger the bill, the harder you ball
Well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long
The quicker you here, the faster you go
That's why where I come from the only thing we know is..

[Bridge]
Work hard, play hard

Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work

[Verse 2]
Hop your pretty ass up in this fucking car
Bitch I'm out this world, girl you know I'm a star
Used to buying rounds but now we buy the bar
Last year they had to ask now they know who we are
Boss shit, walk in the building, I own shit
You can tell by who I'm on the phone with
Yeah nigga talking about grown shit
Niggas too busy jacking my swag
Need to fuck around, get your own shit
Get your own cars, get your own clothes
Get your own smoke, get your own bitch
You ain't reppin' my gang, get your own clique

[Hook]
The bigger the bill, the harder you ball
Well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long
The quicker you here, the faster you go
That's why where I come from the only thing we know is..
The bigger the bill, the harder you ball
Well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long

That's why where I come from the only thing we know is..

[Verse 3]
Go hard
Make sure you do whatever is that you gotta do, that's your job
And niggas gon' hate but that's no prob'
So hey fuck 'em don't need nothing from 'em
Some niggas talking but the shit they claiming don't mean nothing
It's straight from Cali, that's what's in my joint that's what I'm puffin', OG
And been one since I was young enough to know that everybody was gonna know me
Most niggas don't see

[Hook]
The bigger the bill, the harder you ball
Well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long
The quicker you here, the faster you go

The bigger the bill, the harder you ball
Well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long

That's why where I come from the only thing we know is..
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
I pop my trunk and everybody get to running
The "fireman" bitch like my body in the oven
I'm one egg short, I'm just tryin' to get a dozen
My name like honey, it got a lot of bitches buzzing
The neck of the barrel is so long and narrow
And it shoot a bunch, you just lunchin' and Monch like Pharoahe
Bloodshot eye's on the sparrow
And I stay high, but on-point like an arrow
Street nigga baby I'm in love with the gravel
Money gives me life like a man with a gavel
I'm strapped at home, I'm strapped when I travel
I pop my trunk and made them bitches spread like cattle

Live from the 504 it's Mr. Crazy flow
Jumping like a bungee no rope
Even in the dungeon I glow
Even if it ain't sunny I glow
If it ain't about money I go
Nowhere I'm nailed to the floor
Money controls where I go
It is the sail to my boat
And it's going down it's going down
Like there's a whale in the boat
See you can smell that I smoke
And yep I sip that lean
You hit me with that combination that make my eyes bleed
I'm a shark in the water yep I swim with the big
So I don't have time to deal with Willy the squid
L-lilly pad niggas l-look at the monster
Y-you don't want to crash like la la labambas
I got them 24 inches, sittin on them Joe Buddens
And the trunk straight jumping, bitch I can't hear nothin'
Though I might do the Spurs, sittin' on them Tim Duncan's
And in that lamborghini, I do donuts like dunkin
How come every bad bitch with a pussy, wanna fuck 'em
But I just feed 'em drugs, and watch 'em fuck each other
My neck was 100, and my wrist was another
It make her pussy wet, I leave that bitch with a puddle
I'm a beast, I'm a dog, I should rap with a muzzle
Peyton Manning flow, I just go no huddle
Baby girl gettin' straight dick, no cuddle
You know I'm out this world, I just bought a space shuttle

[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Money, get away
You get a good job with more pay and you're okay
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four-star daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Money, get back
I'm alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack
Money, it's a hit
Ah, don't give me that do-goody-good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set
And I think I need a Learjet

[Saxophone Solo]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: David Gilmour]
Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a rise, it's no surprise
That they're giving none away

[Outro: David Gilmour]
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
Away, ooh...

[Spoken Outro: Interview excerpts]
- Yeah -- (chuckles) -- I was in the right!
- Yes, absolutely in the right!
- I certainly was in the right!
- Yeah, I was definitely in the right; that geezer was cruising for a bruising...
- Yeah
- Why does anyone do anything?
- I don't know, I was really drunk at the time...
- I was just telling him it was in, he could get it in number two. He was asking why it wasn't coming up on fader eleven. After, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why it wasn't coming up on fader eleven. It came to a heavy blow, which sorted the matter out

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Us (Us, us, us, us, us) and them (Them, them, them, them)
And after all we're only ordinary men
Me (Me, me, me, me, me) and you (You, you, you, you, you)
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do
"Forward" he cried from the rear
And the front rank died
The general sat and the lines on the map
Moved from side to side

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Black (Black, black, black, black) and blue (Blue, blue, blue, blue)
And who knows which is which and who is who
Up (Up, up, up, up, up) and down (Down, down, down, down)
And in the end it's only round and round, and round
"Haven't you heard it's a battle of words?"
The poster bearer cried
"Listen, son," said the man with the gun
"There's room for you inside"

[Interlude]
I mean, they're not gonna kill ya
So like, if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock
They won't do it again
Dig it? I mean he got off lightly
'Cause I would've given him a thrashing
I only hit him once!
It was only a difference of right and wrong, innit?
But really, I mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 3: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Down (Down, down, down, down) and out (Out, out, out, out)
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about
With (With, with, with, with), without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
Out of the way, it's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For want of the price of tea and a slice
The old man died

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
The lunatic is on the grass
The lunatic is on the grass
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the path
The lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paperboy brings more

[Chorus 1: Roger Waters]
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

[Verse 2: Roger Waters & Peter Watts]
The lunatic is in my head (Hahahahahahaha! Hehehehehehehe!)
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade
You make the change
You rearrange me till I'm sane
You lock the door
And throw away the key
And there's someone in my head but it's not me

[Chorus 2: Roger Waters]
And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

[Outro: Peter Watts & Patricia Watts]
I can't think of anything to say except...
Hahahahahahaha! Hehehehehehehe!
I think it's marvellous!
Hahaha...

[Hook: McKenzie Eddy]
So (Low)
So, so (Low)
I can't believe you (Called)
So (Low)

[Bridge: McKenzie Eddy]
So I see your face again, back where I've been traveling
Time, I think it seems to have it's grip on me
Friends, they say they call it real, no matter what I feel
Can't believe in history, living in this misery

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Yeah, as the joint burns, to the point that it stinging my fingers
Tracks my talk show platform, part Phil Donahue, part Jerry Springer
Momma come when I bring her
She go where I send her, kept it trill from the beginning
From Square One maintain Square Business
Don't concern yourself with my mingling with other bitches
So crafty, mastered the flow Alaska cold, silent foot assassin approach
High when I stroll, not even leaving foot prints in the snow, you know

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
And still them clowns imitate him
Ain't even out of town, we feel like we on vacation
Bottles of champagne a lot of sour inspiration
Captain of my plane rolling J's, waiting for takeoff
Put in nothing but hardwork because it pays off
Fool, she in the mood for jet infused music
Nothing like the rest of these niggas
R.I.P. when I'm done, lay the rest of these niggas

[Bridge: McKenzie Eddy]
So I see the setting sun and I get to feeling numb
Down on that side of town, back where no funs around
Back where I felt like me and everything you want to be
Just flows so easily, some I think may call it free

[Hook]

Yeah they got me back in the studio my nigga
Hehe, got my niggas up in here right now

Yeah, tell y'all how I feel right now

[Verse 1]
I went to my closet
Then I put my robe on
Slip into the living room
Then I turnt the stove on
I'm half-naked, so I put my clothes on
Stash-spot, but I get my roll on
Gettin' my matches, then gettin' my toke on
Yes indeed, now I'm ridin', get my loc on
Soda poppin', it don't quit
Here we go again, another hit
Fifteen-hunnit, I've got you stunnit
I'm blunnit, I'm like Stevie Wonder (hehe)
Yeah indeed, it's the S
The one and only, the king of the West
With nuthin' but the purple in my chest
This one's for my niggas and their guests
Ya dig it?
You niggas bite me
I do this off the dome, ain't no need for me to write it
See, I'm the tightest
I'm like the, nigga inside the encyclopedia, colitis
Listen to me, you know I spark it up
It's Snoop D-O-double-G, now gon' and chalk it up
Ego trippin', 40 oz, seven
Got the bitches dippin' (hehe)
You know it's crackin'
I'm back in action
Have a smoke
Let's roll loc

[Hook]
On my grind, takin' my time
But if I could unwind (keep your profit)
Girl I can't, I'm chasin' bank
Goin' hard in the paint (keep your profit)
Give a little dough
Girl you gotta know, what niggas on the go
Understand your mane
But I'm in the game
But I really wanna be with you

[Verse 2]
What it was, what you smokin'
What up loc
I'm on the block, with my nephews
Paying dues, new tennis shoes
Brand new car, feelin' good
How you livin' Dogg?
I'm still in the hood
Pigs want me, so do these hoes
So I gotsta skip town and do these shows
I got money, but I need more
Everyday I don't which way I'mma go
But I'mma run, instead of walkin'
Still gangsta, still crip-walkin'
Still talkin' shit, still doin' me
Snoop D-O-double-G (haha)
Ya see me
I'm the mellow-mellow baby in that yellow pair of C's

[Bridge]
Woke up early in the mornin'
Six o'clock on the dot
Ain't paid my gas bill
My shower water ain't hot
I've been thinkin' about way
To get up outta this spot
I've been thinkin', about goin', to the East Side
To the East Side, (one more baby) To the East Side
But I really wanna be with you

[Verse 3]
If I was you, and you was me (hehe)
Nigga you's a flea
You could never be, D-O-double-G
That's what they tellin' me
What they sellin' me?
It ain't nuttin'
So erryday, it's how we move
Nigga watch the tray sway
Watch the beat knock, watch the beat bang
Watch Snoopy D-O-double-G do his thang
Sang this song, go ahead dogg
Make it sound good, try to holla at all them broads
Baby cute, but her friend is finer
Talk to a nigga, let's go to Mel's Diner
Me and you baby, over breakfast and brunch
Have a dick in ya mouth, haha that's lunch
Gangsta shit, from a gangsta crip
Let's roll out my nigga, I think it's time to dip

[Hook]
On my grind, takin' my time
But if I could unwind (keep your profit)
Girl I can't, I'm chasin' bank
Goin' hard in the paint (keep your profit)
Give a little dough
Girl you gotta know, what niggas on the go
Understand your mane
But I'm in the game
And I really wanna be with you

[Bridge]
Woke up early in the mornin'
Six o'clock on the dot
Ain't paid my gas bill
My shower water ain't hot
I've been thinkin' about way
To get up outta this spot
I've been thinkin', about goin', to the East Side
To the East Side, (one more baby) to the East Side
But I really wanna be with you

[Outro]
That's so gangsta
Yeah, that's so gangsta
Fifteen-hunnit hahaha
Your bitch ran up to me the other day in the club talkin' bout
"I know um... Lorenz from Fifteen-hunnit"
I said: "Bitch, you betta get out my face unless you got Fifteen-hunnit in cash up on ya, ya know what I'm talkin' about"
Really wanna be witchu
(ha ha, ay man, what they call you man?)

(Chorus)
Hello I'm just a mellow fellow
Just give me a bud and a cigarillo
And I'mma keep it ghetto
Cause I stick wit it just like velcro
Cause I'm...
Mellow (x9)
I'm just a mellow fellow

(Verse 1)
I'm real calm cool and collective
So when I walk in they know what to expect its
B.o.B. in the session
Stand in and mister all this hate so ineffective
Now thats what I call interesting
I gotta gameplan but they can't intercept it
They can't do nothing but respect it
Because my flow is anorexic, sick, its infected
(haha yeah its B.o.B. man, I'm just a mellow fellow, stay real still like jello)

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
Haha its B.o. bellow
All about the green ain't worried bout yellow
What does that mean?
Hah, ya know, me and bread go together like hansel and gretel
Well in the ghetto
The cycle is a merry go round so you curse when they cut off your umbilical
I remember when life used to be miserable
But since my brain changed ive been seeing miracles

(haha yeah man real talk
Treat life good it'll treat you good back)

(Chorus x2)

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Yo, I'm getting older now, 23 years old
And half of me just wants to make the move and go and settle down
The other half's like, "Hell no, you better mess around
Don't let me down, especially when you got an album coming out"
When I first saw you I'm like, "Aw shit
Goddamn it, look what God did, Hail Mary Jesus"
Three years later I'm sitting in our apartment
Thinking about all the places that my heart's been
I mean it's crazy right, this is maybe wife
The one that found me in a drought, pulled me out, and made me right
Through the ups and downs we stuck it out and now you're leaving town
Another couple thousand miles south, which leads to crazy fights
And I don't know how to deal with it
I gotta be real with ya
Each day I get filled with the
Feeling of realer love, we wanna continue it, but
This ain't the same old love song
'Cause we been through the depths where all the trust is gone
For months on end all we have is phone calls
But you know what makes it worth it?
To watch someone progress, to have them watch you
Someone that you respect and value and cry to
It's something so comforting, 'cause it could bring so much truth
But then magic can be stagnant and the relationship doesn't move
The commitments to yourself, and that you're always learning
To acknowledge you're both perfect and still wanna keep working
To progress as a person, but as an individual entity
And then come together as a unit but still maintain that identity
It sounds so elementary, but it's so complex
The most delicate balance to get away from attachments
But it can work, I'm attempted, nah, we're living it
To keep defining and redefining what love and commitment is
Sing that, come on

[Chorus 1: Evan Roman]
Every time
I can't
Ignore you
Every time I come around
I see your face
Always moving

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Yo, just working on dependency
Sometimes the thing you love the most in this world, you just gotta let it be
It hurts to have to set it free
And if it does or doesn't work we both know that it was meant to breathe
Can't hide from experiences
And there's so many people out there in this world we're gonna find interesting
It's only a matter of time before that right connection
Thousands of miles away, what you expect?
You see I'm wondering where are you
Tearing the label off of a beer as I'm sitting at this bar stool
You would tell me not to call you
To never use you as a fall through, to sit with my emotion
But the lump in my throat builds as the heart rips open up
And not even your voice alone can shift to go and close it shut
So I just let it flow through me
Feeling lifted from the spirit like the bag in American Beauty
And if your life truly flashes in front of you
When you die just know the best time of my life has been loving you
I love you, you know
Let's get 'em, come on

[Chorus 2: Evan Roman]
We been together
But in my head
We would break apart
I would hold my heart, tied inside
But you knew that my soul
Could not be
Given to anybody
Easily, woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh

[Outro: Evan Roman (Macklemore)]
(It's a beautiful thing isn't it?
One more time Ev) Every time
I can't
Ignore you (It feels good, don't it?)
Every time I come around
I see your face (Yes)
Always moving

[Verse 1]
Our lungs are filled with the purple from the jungle
Never fumble, got the work right by the grundel
Twin dick-sucks for me and my son
That's before he was three, smoking weed in the blunt
Straight from Flushing, where the birds are hanging dead in the window
Scent of garbage make me sick, getting head in the rental
Got the lamb rack, pan-roasted, laced it with fennel
Little yogurt that been drizzled over might be a winner
Come and see me, Nona hand-makes the fettucini
Halla makes the baklava - getting paper kahskaval
Lahmacun Salad-smoking savage out of Sarasota
Macho man, the taco stand is where the hook is kept
30 dollars get you pussycat, right in the kitchen where they cooking at
Manteca, architecture Art Deco
Twist the pussy like a soft pretzel
I'm such a special guy, I'd rather die than ever testify
You'd sooner see me at the party with a vest and tie
Shorts, that's my steez when I'm stepping
Strolling down the streets like the westerns
Double weapons, at my sides and preparing for the showdown
Spinning like a wild maneuver, wilding at the ho down
Hold ground, stand firm, you little sissies got a chance
Now it's time to give a man burn

[Verse 2]
Yo, you try to fuck with Bronsolini, it's a crucial calling
Guaranteed you're gonna lose just like the Brooklyn brawler
Mister Wonderful in short-sets, Cortex
Gore-tex the bottom of the feet in case the floor wet
Floral scented, hand-crafted on the mother earth
Kinda strange, things been funny since my brother's birth
Shaking hands as if the money connect
Blow a ransom on the yacht, have a seed in Quebec
Respect my exquisite mystique, pretty petite
Little hookers running wild, giving head in the street
But still, slicing nuts, clean off that's with the razor
I'm laughing in the tavern in fresh Brunos and blazers - chilling
Spark the pepper
Queens shit, spark the pepper, PS

[Intro: Lil Wayne & DJ Drama]
Chyeah!
You guessed accurately
It's me, ladies and gents
Weezy F. Baby, please say the "Baby"
B told you that, yeah (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
Gangsta Grillz
All up in your grill, nigga
Drama, holla at your nigga (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
I won't lose me, y'all
Nope
This is the Dedication!
Rest in peace! (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
So now, I'm burying the burner in the bomber
I carry the concerns of my mama
I'm married to the money and the power
And still got guns on my side for my private affairs
Yeah, I know that water get cold, but I dive in it bare
And swim through it, alive and aware—I been through it
You probably never been to it, so now I dip through it
And they respect me like a pistol, I'm hip to it
I gets to it, like, "Just do it," I miss doing it
Hundred-shot drum, play 'em some clip music
I am the drum major, the drum section waiting
All it takes is one signal: you can get a cadence
You can get it catered, I'm at your service like a waiter
When it's beef, I become a nigga neighbor (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
I put potatoes on the heater, no labor, later
Now, how me make mashed potatoes (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
French-fry niggas, I bench, then fire niggas—bye, niggas!
Wet 'em up like rivers—now, flow by, niggas
I'm dripping-dry fly, now, squint your eyes bitches
I Dempsey-Tom bitches up out of new Bentleys
I'm old school like a loose Winston
Like, "Since when they make bulletproof skin?"
I put it to your chin, and grin, and sin, and then, I—
Sin again; then, I'm gone in the wind
And I'm dumping my Scarlett O'Hara in the canal
'Cause I'm not getting stopped with cop paraphernal'
Now, I'm preparing to ill, not preparing to fail
'Cause my flow is for real, like the Sahara and Hell
Comparisons is irrelevant, I'm a arrogant male, yeah
I can handle it, I can graduate Yale, yeah (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
They featherweight, I sporadically ill the fuck out
And you can automatically killed, yeah (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
Peep the narrative of the New Orleans heritage
You can go get your evidence, I tell where and tell you when
I was prescribing medicine, you was getting your lesson in
I was getting my adolescent in (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
Lesser than God only, better than my last is what I strive for
Dwelling on my past, I get high, so I light it up and smoke
Keep that Mary Poppins poppin' like a toaster
I'm Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Can't forget that purple potion—oh, shit
You ho niggas is ass, that's ho shit
So, shit, I blow bigger and mash, and laugh, like, "Ohh, shit!"
I'm the best—no shit! Weezy

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to
Break!

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up when I'm talking to you!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
I'm about to break!

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to
Break!

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone
You live what you've learned
You want someone to hurt like you
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
You love the things I say I do
The way I hurt myself again, just to get back at you
You take away, when I give in
My life, my pride is broken

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You like to think you're never wrong
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone
You live what you've learned
You want someone to hurt like you
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last
Forfeit the game before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame and puts your name to shame
Cover up your face, you can't run the race
The pace is too fast, you just won't last

[Chorus: Chester Bennington and (Mike Shinoda)]
You like to think you're never wrong
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone
You live what you've learned
You want someone to hurt like you
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned
You like to think you're never wrong (Forfeit the game)
You live what you've learned
You have to act like you're someone (Forfeit the game)
You live what you've learned
You want someone to hurt like you (Forfeit the game)
You live what you've learned
You want to share what you have been through
You live what you've learned

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling, I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming) Confusing what is real
(This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling) Confusing what is real

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves, but I'm lost within
I put on my daily façade, but then
I just end up getting hurt again

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
By myself (Myself), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself
(Myself), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
If I turn my back, I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
If I let them go, I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them, I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
By myself (Myself), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself
(Myself), I ask why
But in my mind, I find I can't rely on myself

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
How do you think I've lost so much?
I'm so afraid that I'm out of touch
How do you expect I will know what to do
When all I know is what you tell me to?

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do, how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I'm stuck on the outside
Don't you know
I can't tell you how to make it go
No matter what I do, how hard I try
I can't seem to convince myself why
I'm stuck on the outside

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in
I can't hold on to what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on to anything, watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I've lied to you
The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Everything falls apart, even the people
Who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Everything has to end, you'll soon find
We're out of time left to watch it all unwind
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see you're testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see you're testing me pushes me away

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I've tried, like you
To do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Everything falls apart, even the people
Who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Everything has to end, you'll soon find
We're out of time left to watch it all unwind
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see you're testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see you're testing me pushes me away

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
We're all out of time
This is how we find how it all unwinds
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
We're all out of time
This is how we find how it all unwinds
The sacrifice is never knowing

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see you're testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away, why I played myself this way
Now I see you're testing me pushes me away

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Pushes me away

[Produced By: Kid Cudi]

[Intro]
"Kill 'em, kill all them things"
Allow it
Dennis, you gotta hook me up with some more of this whiskey
Turnt up

[Verse 1]
Now I don't give a fuck what niggas doing
I'm wearin' Balmain thousand dollar pants
Wake up, bake up, then I'm in my Benz
Come to think about it, don't have many friends
Go to brunch by my damn self
Flirt with girls when they see my car
Fuck 'em when they see that I'm a star
Never ever open up or show my heart
It's the coldest winter in the summer, dawg
Many women, mothafuck 'em all
They just really want to train a dog
I'm a real nigga to the core
Off top baby girl further more
Pedal to the metal to the floor
On Mulholland while I'm hitting corners hard
Yeah I gotta hit them corners hard

[Break]
I guess I'm just a lost cause
Just a skinny nigga with so many flaws
Starin' in that night, tight jawed
Fingers digging right inside my palm
Waitin' waitin' for the calm
Seem to think I know what's goin' on
I'm finally comin' alive
And it seems the ghost is movin' on

[Interlude]
You know what that is? I told you what that is, that's a alien bruv, believe it
(Those guys didn't think I would do it, I told you I was gonna do it)

[Verse 2]
See, I could never have a desk job
My work take a nigga abroad
Meeting up late with foreign broads
Relaxing cause a nigga hustle hard
Man I gotta take a load off
Need a dime that'll take her clothes off
Took a trip out to Doha
Filmin' short films on a whim
Got dinner in a few with prince Sheikh
Kanye changed a nigga life twice
Gotta ride, gotta rep, ay
Getting rid of all the dead weight
Niggas really want me dead, hate
Not my fault I'm intriguing
Drinkin' and drivin': no weavin'
Pop a molly, feelin' ten again
Project X type weekend
Except a nigga damn near thirty
Like twenty one had never ended
Here I go with my second wind, bitch
You already know I'm goin' in
And I've been waitin'
I've been waitin' to shit on you

[Outro]
Yeah, G.O.O.D. music we the family
Kid motherfuckin' Cudi

[Verse]
Pickin' out my fro with my fist comb
I got a tab at the Stone baby, this long
My little brother was havin' a little trouble
I hope that he doesn't care that it's in this song
Koreatown lunchin', talkin' 'bout how to run things
He said Atlanta wanted somethin'
Waka, Jeezy, and Future got the streets locked down
Copycats making sure T.I.P. keep that crown
I'm fucking 'round with the truth, went to see The Roots
Quest brought me back on stage in a suit
I went hard 'cause niggas say that I'm soft
Even Black Thought thought
I'm aiming a little hard, I gotta be honest
Feelin' like the other stuff is kinda behind us
Makin' jokes here and there done got us some dollars
I'm tryna show the whole world what it is and it ain't a game
He said, "Homie, stay the course, ain't shit changed
Weird night, and everybody was tipsy
Hangin' out with Questlove reminiscing 'bout Whitney
He like, "Man, we can't even make it to 50?!"
That reminds me
I sent a long text message to my mom and pop
I got the same speech when I left 30 Rock
My mom like, "Why you wanna leave a good job?"
My dad like, "Do your thing, boy, don't stop"
Shout out to my nigga Lud, shout out to my nigga Swank
For hanging at the crib and telling me what you think
Speak from your heart and never compromise what you feel's real
And never let these white people tell you how to feel
Never let anybody tell you how to feel
I wanted what they had back in the fourth grade
Family vacays, you know I did it all
Just to see my lil' sis by a waterfall
My great granddad bought his own freedom
Walk barefoot to Virginia to start his own peanut farm
So don't be alarmed, man, I'm royalty
Jam of the week, V103
No cosign, no bovine
More swag, pull back on the punchlines
Starving, every track means lunchtime
Huh, I'm a star, how could I not shine?
Fuckboys chase hype and scrat chicks
And niggas who stopped texting after 1.6
DG Lover ain't nothin' to fuck wit'
D-Money ain't nothin' to fuck wit'
And what's a leader if he isn't reluctant?
Too bad for y'all, I'm blastin' off
I'm not Asher Roth, I don't sleep on my bread
Dick riders stay close, I might flash a ball
Sometimes, all this shit make a nigga feel guilty
I used to sleep with them roaches
Back of my mind though, I hope the show gets canceled
Maybe then I can focus
Hawaii touch down, go ahead baby, put your shades on
East Side! East Side to the gravestone!
Brown liquor, but my girl in Bed-Stuy
Nigga, you got drive like a sale at Best Buy, ugh
Hold up, hold up, we can do better
Put my voice on the track, man, that shit is much wetter
At the studio at 8 AM, hit the booth then eat
Nigga, we ain't them, nigga, we ain't them!
Drop a line, it's your Facebook status
Said that shit about a week ago, you still mad at us
If there's something on your chest, nigga, let it out
'Cause I'm the best, da-da-da
Eh eh eh Childish Gambino, ho
Eh eh eh Childish Gambino, ho

Sippin' on that Knob Creek, royalty is mob deep
Kinda nigga eatin' out yo pussy when your mom's asleep
Drinkin' mango lassi, can't nobody stop me
Give your boy a track and leave the body like Gadhafi
Cause ain't nobody fuckin' with me, man
Ain't nobody fuckin' like it's HIV, man
It's crazy how Memorial Drive is just that
Only liquor stores and porn survivin' the cutback, but hold up
Hold up, hold up, man my neighbor just shot himself
Bullet to the head and exit out the bottom left
I never holla back, bitches and all of that
I got my work until she comes and forms a dollar stack
When you counting the Ninja Turtles while these white guys get fraternal?
You don’t want no problems, we be on that BME
The only nigga slinging 30 rocks - legally
Throw the verses on the track but ain't nobody seein' me?
I can't see, shout out to my nigga Ellison
It's been a year since I said "Too expensive"
The post office won't give my dad his pension
Your girls get mad when I pull out like extensions
Pete's still goin', Chi's still blowin'
My girl Polynesian you can say I got Samoan
It's a marriage - it's apparent that this is it
In a year I went from Will Farrell to Will Smith
And my turds terrified cause I killed this shit
Let me see you fucking bounce with it
Kay, ay, ay
Ay (we flexin')
Ay (we flexin')
Ay (we flexin')
Woo!
Here we go

[Verse 1]
Nigga I'm tight like BVD
Nigga I'm sick like CDC
All my shit be classic, yours gets skipped like DVDs
This beat be droppin' acid, do we have to tell 'em so?
Keysha got me percocets I'm chillin' and it's hella dope
Tell 'em ho, I ain't Tebow, I don't pray for change
All I do is do it, I'm Nike, I'm drinking Gatorade
I got my hoodie so I gotta be a gangster
Why Geraldo Rivera look like a child molester?
Heh, we the ill pandemic
Sick boy, nigga, yeah we royalty forever
All my G-O-O-Ns are well-spoken
One white guy, he's a classic token
Asses open, droppin' shit
Flashback, that's a hashtag
Man fuck down like a mersey
Smell these niggas like an armpit
I be in like David on my avid baby making hits
They be making white girls like 'Ye did Taylor Swift
Ain't that some shit, really though, Sealy Posturepedic ho
When she in my bed but she ain't haven't even seen a video?
Now shoot that, who's that?
Roll up on niggas like fruit snacks
You better walk big Gambino but you ain't got money
Motherfucker that's too bad
That's like - countin' fat stacks out in Harlem
That's like - fucking Kat Stacks with no condom
Stupid, everybody out here needs to cool it
Rap stepfather, no more hanging in the pool shit
Niggas that I'm cool with, they don't need to show me
That Gambino girls are royalty now nigga that's an army!
We like

[Hook]
We flexin', we flexin'
We flexin', baby run it back!
Woo, woo! We flexin', we flexin' (Baby run it back!)

[Verse 2]
Street monsters, where the fuck is Gordon?
Maria I want to be puttin' that thing on your daughter
Gambino brings the sushi, they doin' John Belushi
So stupid but they cutie so sue me if I get booty
That's Louis, Gucci or Prada, Bugatti bitches who holla
Wanna take Foxy out but I gotta be gettin' Donnas, like
"I'm an artist man." No y'all ain't!
Man fuck Photoshop, I'm in MS Paint!
Making circles with that circle thing, Gambino boy you murdering
Now I got this afro those cornrows were fuckin' hurting me
When you taking these girls up to Malibu
When the hot girl coming to a bug-a-boo?
I like my face when I'm under you
Screen Actors Guild with a "W," swag

[Hook]
We flexin', we flexin'
We flexin', baby run it back!
We flexin', we flexin'
We flexin', baby run it back!

[Chorus]
Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow
You just put your lips together and you come real close
Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Here we go

[Verse 1]
Look, I'm bettin' you like people
And I'm bettin' you love freak mode
And I'm bettin' you like girls
That give love to girls and stroke your little ego
I bet you I'm guilty, your honor (Honor)
That's just how we live in my genre (Genre)
Who in the hell done paved the road wider?
There's only one Flo and one Rida
I'm a damn shame, order more champagne
Pulling them hamstrings, tryna put it on ya
Bet your lips spin back around, come up
Slow it down, baby, take a little longer

[Chorus]
Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow
You just put your lips together and you come real close
Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Here we go

[Post-Chorus]
Whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Whist-whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Whist-whistle, baby, whistle, baby

[Verse 2]
It's like everywhere I go, my whistle ready to blow
Shawty don't even know, she can get in it for the low
Told me she not a pro, it's okay, it's under control
Show me soprano 'cause, girl, you can handle
Baby, we start slow, then you come up and park close
Girl, I'm the whistle man, my Bugatti the same notes
Show me your perfect pitch, you got it, my banjo
Talented with your lips like you blew out a candle
So amusing (Amusing)
Now you can make a whistle with the music (Music)
Hope you ain't got no issues, you can do it (Do it)
Even if it's no picture, never lose it (Lose it)

[Chorus]
Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow
You just put your lips together and you come real close
Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Here we go

[Post-Chorus]
Whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Whist-whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Whist-whistle, baby, whistle, baby

[Bridge]
Go on, girl, you can twerk it
Let me see you whistle while you work it
I'ma lay it back, don't stop it
'Cause I love it how you drop it, drop it, drop it on me
Now, shorty, make that whistle blow-ow-ow-ow
Yeah, baby, make that whistle blow-ow-ow

[Chorus]
Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Let me know
Girl, I'm gonna show you how to do it and we start real slow
You just put your lips together and you come real close
Can you blow my whistle, baby, whistle, baby? Here we go

[Post-Chorus / Outro]
Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whist-whistle, baby, whistle, baby

Whistle, baby, whistle, baby
Can you blow my whistle, baby?
Whist-whistle, baby, whistle, baby

[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm, I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my-my-my
Out of my mind-mi'-mi'-mi'-mi'
I'm out of my fucking mind
Out of my fucking mind, mind

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I'm out of my fucking mind, gee, gee, golly, oh my
I was doing fine, once upon a time
Then my brain left and it didn't say bye
Don't look at me wrong, I'm out of my mind
Like Nostradamus and da Vinci combined
So paranoid of espionage
I'm watching my doors and checking my blinds
My brain is on vacation, they telling me
And I'm bi-polar to the severity
And I need medication, apparently
And some Electroconvulsive therapy
I am a rebel, but yes, I'm so militant
Still, I'm illegible for disabilities
I am psychotic but there is no remedy
This is not figurative, this is literally
If these niggas go dumb, I go to the mental facility
See, man, I'm so out there, I slap fives with ET
I don't need a feature
They don't want me to eat à la carte when I'm on this beat
If you feel the same as me, then you got to agree
I'm out of my mind

[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm, I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my-my-my
Out of my mind-mi'-mi'-mi'-mi'
I'm out of my fucking mind
Out of my fucking mind, mind

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
What's your name? B.o.B?
So, they calling you Bob?
Stop playing, nigga, you know that I'm known for the 'Bob
Couple hit songs, got you thinking you a hearthrob
Well, this thang so good, make a nigga wanna sob (Hmm, hmm)
You don't need a feature?
Nigga, I'm the feature
You gon' be the priest, and I'ma be the preacher
You can be the He-Man, I'ma be the She-Ra
You can be the Grim, I'ma be the Reaper
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night skies
Are like shooting stars?
Well, you gon' really need a wish right now
When my goons come through and start shooting stars
You know, I'm all about shoes and cars
I'm kinda drunk off booze, Bacardi
I told Baby when I get my new advance
I'ma blow that motherfucker on a blue Bugatti
You know, I graduated summa cum laude
That's why they thinking I'm Illuminati
And matter fact, let's kiss and make-up
I'll help you escape on my blue Ducati
Hallelujah!

[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm, I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my-my-my
Out of my mind-mi'-mi'-mi'-mi'
I'm out of my fucking mind
Out of my fucking mind, mind

[Interlude: B.o.B]
I'm out of it
I can't seem to come out of it
What's going on inside of my head?
It feels like I'm being John Malkovich
Ladies and gentlemen, please tone it down a bit
There is an announcement, I'd like to announce (It...)
Wait, how am I suppose to pronounce this shit?

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
I don't need a sub, I don't need a speaker
'Cause a nigga bring the noise like an onomatopoeia
Leave him in the dust, all he see is my Adidas
Na-na-na-na boo-boo, wouldn't want to be ya
Never turning back, how you think I got here?
And I'm never slowing down; fuck was that, a deer?
If you got a problem, step to the office
Matter fact, never mind, talk to the Kiosk, bi-atch
You have no idea
That's why they call me B-dot; been a maniac ever since I was knee-high
Man, I swear to God, I'ma need help
Someone call Charter; maybe call FEMA
'Cause I got to be crazy or outta my mind to have this many stamps on my VISA, vis-à-vis

[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm, I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my-my-my
Out of my mind-mi'-mi'-mi'-mi'
I'm out of my fucking mind
Out of my fucking mind, mind

[Outro: B.o.B & Nicki Minaj]
Wait, if I'm here and you're there?
And I'm here and you're there? 

[repeats]
(If I'm there and you're here?)
And I'm here and you're there?
(If I'm there and you're here?)
And if I'm here and you're there?
(If I'm there and you're here?)
And if I'm here and you're there?

[Outro: Nicki Minaj (whispering)]
Yeah, you're right there, and here
Um, yeah, yeah (We're outta here)
Nicki, B.o.B, ho
(Shh... they might be listening)

[Childish Gambino]
Childish Gambino you will get in with a wristband he know
People took an hour just to stand outside in line
I knew that you would do it, and I reckon you lookin' fine
These bitches better be mine, I'm horny all the time
Gambino be the one who put a hump up in your spine
Drink a little wine, do a little dance
Now im goin' home, now im in your pants
Forget that, I ain't take the condom off
New swag ever since im bustin' off
I get head like a bottle of Tylenol
You like girls when you know you can buy them all
A fireball, I'm hot as fuck, I bust a nut with tons of sluts
Go ahead shake your thing baby, look hot
Why the girls doin' me? Ho why not?
I mean why not?

[Hook]
Tell her, some bullshit on my whip im 'bout to take it back
When I switch it up I pull up in the newest jag
Any time we in I hit the strip and do it bad
Y'all nigga's hatin' us I know we make 'em mad
It make 'em mad
It make 'em mad
It make 'em mad
When we put on the swag
It make 'em mad when we put on the swag

[Steve G. Lover]
Ay, Childish let me get em'
They ain't in our league, so they can't hang with em'
Strip club, and the squad came with em'
Two girls coming home like they fresh outta prison
Say words if you get it
We only give a damn if a check came with it
Two blunts and that old dude who lives it
I got bitches in the pen who I don't even visit
You came in the carpet
You get a lot of pussy when they make you a star
A girl in LA and I don't know her name
But she get pissed off when she talking insane
Paper man people guns with the thang'
I was a little broke but it started to change
Drop a couple songs, and that's all of the bang
Cause I ridin' on the track like I'm part of a train
My girl southside when I hit the booth
I drink roc' roc' straight fuck the juice
A big bro throw bread like fuck the loot
I'm back bitch, I'm back Prince
I'm back shit, my home boy pissed off
I put my hands on that ass, cause that shit soft
Two guns it'll burn off
When you stunt like Stevie, it'll turn off

[Hook]
TORY LANEZ

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]

Man they got me shining on my face and chain
All white diamonds make my necklace such a racial thing
30 bad bitches like a lakers game but expect my uniform is green Boi
Major Payne im bossing
Lay you in the creek like the Dawson
Hit her from the back she said "eeeeee" like a dolphin
Tryna pull Leborn in some heels, ballin
Rappers hit the diving board jump into your coffin
And you know it , im a pimp and you won't go their
So you might be fly but I make it look like you got no gear

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]

My flow is nastier then beef stroganoff
On a nasty man who didn't own a cloth
In a low down basement stroking off
To a picture of a lady name Oprah-Ross Ewwh
I let money brush shoulders off
And after I brush I am known to floss
Flow like a gun I will toast you off
They be like Wow look its Tlanez
Oh my god check him out look he changed
Ever since the money he been acting all strange
I seen him in the telly with like 54 dames
Cuz im up like this so rup like this

[Chorus]
You know I hate sleeping alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But baby, that was a long time ago
I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it
On top of you not callin' me back
You see, I bet you think it's all on track
And you actin' like it's all o' that
I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it
Let's go, let's go, little kitty cat
I think it's time to go
Let's go, little kitty cat
He don't want no mo'
Let's go, little kitty cat
Quite frankly, no more givin' it
I'm not feelin' it

[Verse 1]
It's like we at two places, but different paces
We in trouble, but you won't meet me at the bridge
It hurts, it feels deserted
Did you forget where your heart lives?

[Pre-Chorus]
What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body?
Acting like I'm not nobody
You gon' make me call somebody
What about my body, body?
What about my body, body?
You would rather go and party
Somehow, somewhere I'll be naughty

[Chorus]
You know I hate sleeping alone
But you said that you would soon be home
But baby, that was a long time ago
I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it
On top of you not callin' me back
You see, I bet you think it's all on track
And you actin' like it's all o' that

[Verse 2]
(Let me show you how to get there)
Take a left to compassion (Lights will be flashin')
Keep straight and you'll see the sun right there
Affection (You're in the wrong direction)
If I get caught, see, it just seems that you don't care

[Pre-Chorus]
What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body
Acting like I'm not nobody
You gon' make me call somebody
What about my body, body?

You would rather go and party
Somehow, somewhere I'll be naughty

[Chorus]
You know I hate sleeping alone
But you said that you would soon be home (You said you would soon be home)
But baby, that was a long time ago

[Bridge]
Got diamonds on my neck
Got diamonds on my records
Since 16, I was coming down, ridin' Lexus
How you gon' neglect this? You is just a hot mess
You can call Tyrone, you ain't gots to lie, Craig
What about my body, body?
What about my body, body?
I'm in the house all alone, you'd rather go and party?
What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body?
Acting like I'm nobody

[Outro]
Let's go, let's go, little kitty cat
I think it's time to go

He ain't want no mo'
Let's go, little kitty cat
No mo' getting' it, I'm not feelin' it

[Intro: Morgan Freeman]
As the war between light and darkness continues
Heroes and villains become harder to identify
Kindred spirits separated at birth
Fighting for their place in time to be solidified
The clock ticks faster and faster
While time runs a marathon in this Babylon
But see, the end is only the beginning
The beginning of the calm before the storm

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I used to dream of success, now success is inadequate
It seems the bigger I get it's the more they get mad at me
Cause there ain't no rules inside this fight that we battling
And it ain't no leftover scraps, you only eat if you capture it
And I swear it's like a fucked up reality
But creation needs a devil, the devil needs an advocate
I guess, and I ain't too big on duality but
You think you know me? You ain't seen the half of me
So fly: no gravity, so high: Mount Everest
And the show must go on, yes, but I don't have to act in it
And they don't make a television that handles the frequencies
Of my channel and there ain't no computer that can hack it
It just don't have the capacity, hell nah, that ain't happening
You hustle? Well we are Grand Hustle, nigga, we mastered it
Y'all working on your bachelors, we ball like the athletes
Drink wine out of chalices on Sunday like we catholics
And if this is an embassy, consider me ambassador
Official, no artificial preservatives or additives
I love it all but I ain't attached to it
They call this a game because it is exactly

[Hook: B.o.B]
Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling
That I can't wait up, cause time is ticking
Bombs away (Bombs away)
Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling
That I can't wait up, cause time is ticking
Bombs away (Bombs away)

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
And it seems like in the grand scheme of it all
The world's run by a few people and we never seen them at all
How do they exist if we don't know who they are?
They can be you, they could be me, they could be queens and gods
Some say that we're slaves, an alien race created us all
From a distant star, some say through evolution we evolve
But if anything, what you finna see is a change, don't be alarmed
And whoever they are, well I think that it's time we start takin' charge
Fuck rules, fuck bars, you can be whatever you want
You could be a star with a car with a house made out of gold
And in the springs, on the falls, you could never see it all
If you don't know what I mean, have you seen Niagara Falls?
Man I swear this world is ours, but I've just been pushed too far
Now I be beasting up on these bars
Freak out a beat and then beat it out raw
Good God, if I go this hard, by the time I'm ninety
I won't need viagra nah, even if I had a dog
I be the canine, I'd have a ball
Better watch out when you cross my yard
I am a flame, I am the spark
I am in drive, y'all are in park
Look at my shot, look at the arc
Look at the crowd as soon as I start
Look in they eyes and look in they hearts
Two middle fingers straight at the law
Sincerely yours, so pray to your lord
Cause this is a war, ain't talkin' 'bout bullets and swords
UFOs don't make any noise
When they travel in hyper speed, so welcome aboard

[Hook: B.o.B]
Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling
That I can't wait up, cause time is ticking
Bombs away (Bombs away)
Whenever I wake up, I get this feeling
That I can't wait up, cause time is ticking
Bombs away (Bombs away)

[Outro: Morgan Freeman]
As the mask of deception falls off the face of humanity
Unveiling the grim reality of duality
In which everyone is a casualty, no one will be exempt
Truth has many shades
It's not a matter of black and white, but gray
Although many, we are one, so in the final analysis
Could it be that we are fighting a war that can't be won?

[Intro]
Swavey
Haha ay yo Jae Fressco
They be askin' why us Canadian niggas say styll
Yeah Canada

[Verse 1]
Ridin', turnin' corners like I'm Sprewell
So much money, I can't even fit my jeans well
Girls love me 'cause my engine is a V12
I'm a boss, ain't gon' tell you all the details
Mememe, ay boy, I'm who your girl tryna like
Mememe, ay boy, you won't see me tryna wife
They wonder who I'm rhymin' like, they bump me like I'm china white
I try to be stuntin' but red and blue colors be clashing and having a diamond fight
Fly talk, fly talk, nigga, it's that fly talk
And I am so fly that I can jump and touch the sidewalk
Platinum in my grill, bitch, listen to when I talk
Haters how you feel, trick? I'm on your girl iPod

[Chorus]
I'm ridin', styll, shining', styll
Your girl on my dick, she love my diamonds, styll

Your girl on my dick, she love my diamonds in my Rollie, styll
I got guala, styll, dollar, bills
Girls love a nigga, wanna holla, styll

[Verse 2]
White boy shorts lookin' awesome
Bad blonde chick, I call her Blossom
Rims cripin' with a swan bangin' swanson
Your chick trippin', I'ma kick her out my car again
My buttoned up cardigan look like the start of the hardest shit you ever seen
Meaning I could probably pull all the women in which you have currently been, with
I ain't no one to fib with, why? 'Cause I am a misfit
But I am so swavey that I can say anythin' to you and I can make hits
Ooh, swear I break it down
Bottle rate is goin' up, that's my bank account
Ooh, lemme say it loud
Strong trees, bad broads, lemme break 'em down

[Chorus]
I'm ridin', styll, shining', styll
Your girl on my dick, she love my diamonds, styll
I got guala, styll, dolla, bills
Girls love a nigga, wanna holla, styll
I'm ridin', styll, shining in my Rollie
Your girl on my dick, she love my diamonds in my Rollie, styll
I got guala, styll, dollar, bills
Girls love a nigga, wanna holla, styll

[Verse 3]
Jewelry game screamin' with the loud bling
Stackin' money 'bout as tall as Yao Ming
Bad girl from the ghetto, that's my wild thing
Car soundin' like my speaker is a loud thing
Fresher than niggas who hating, swavey
Been pressin' the niggas who fakin', swavey
She has to be yours, I done had her before
I'm not impressed with the chick you datin'

[Interlude]
No no no, that is not swavey
Your girl is definitely, anti-swave
Anti-swave

[Verse 4]
My girls are Bajan or Asian persuasion or maybe she's even Jamaican
I skeet on your women and sleep on you niggas like I live life in a vacation
Bangin' 'cause I'm wildin', Asian chick from Shaolin
Bank account is so big, that I could fit your child in
Bank cards I'm swipin', bad broads I'm pipin'
Tongue here and it's fun here, I'm too young here to be wifin'
You can be the star, Tory is the centrefold
And I just hit your broad, now she open like an envelope
I'm sick with no antidote and uh, why you in her for?
Whip game fruity, it be lookin' like some cantaloupe

[Chorus]
I'm ridin', styll, shining', styll
Your girl on my dick, she love my diamonds, styll
I got guala, styll, dolla, bills
Girls love a nigga, wanna holla, styll

[Outro]
'Bout 10 seconds of talkin' that good ish and I'ma talk that good ish right styll. Time is money styll. Everybody know we in the buildin' styll. I'm with your girl styll and I got her in my knapsack styll. I ain't even gotta front though. What up Jae Fresco? Exclusive swave

Usher, baby

I see you over there, so hypnotic
Thinking 'bout what I'd do to that body
I'd get you like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Got no drink in my hand, but I'm wasted
Getting drunk off the thought of you naked
I get you like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
And I try to fight it, to fight it
But you're so magnetic, magnetic
Got one life, just live it, just live it
Now relax and get on your back

[Chorus]
If you wanna scream, “yeah”
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby

Get you going like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
If you wanna scream (Yeah, c'mon)

[Verse 2]
Kill the lights, shut them off, you're electric
Devil eyes telling me come and get it
I'll have you like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Girl, tonight, you're the prey, I'm the hunter (Hunter)
Take you here, take you there, take you under
Imagine me, whispering in your ear that I wanna
Take off all your clothes and put something on you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I try to fight it, to fight it
But you're so magnetic, magnetic
Got one life, just live it, just live it
Now relax and get on your back

[Chorus]
If you wanna scream, “yeah”, oh
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
If you want it done right
Hope you're ready to go all night
Get you going like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby, yeah
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
If you wanna scream

La da, la da, la da, da da da
Hey, somebody scream out with me, oh

[Chorus]
If you wanna scream, “yeah”
Let me know and I'll take you there

If you want it done right (Right)
Hope you're ready to go all night
Get you going like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
If you wanna scream (Scream, scream, scream)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & B.o.B]
If anybody feeling fresh in the building
Take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn, I'm killing them, damn, I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now
And if you too fresh in the building
Then take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now (Right now)
And say damn, I'm killing them (Damn), damn, I'm killing them (Damn)
I know they feeling me now

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
And I'm still here with a lifestyle you would kill fo' (Brap!)
Still here with the same shoes that I had on from the get-go (Yeah)
Straight out of Atlanta, Georgia, for any of y'all that didn't know (East Side)
And I'm never that hard to find because 420 is my zip code (Haha, yeah)
But back then couldn't get dro (Nah) 'cause back then I was this broke (Yeah)
That's why I got so many hustles (Uh), bruh man from the fifth floor (Nah)
What would you do in the middle of the winter
When the sun goes down and it gets cold?
Growin' up in a house with no stove
No doors, no walls, no windows
And my brother was always fresher
I would go to school in his clothes, when I did go
So that's why now this the type of life that I live for
Comin' up as a youngin', man, some nights I would vomit
I would throw up on myself 'cause I was so sick to my stomach
Now I'm the shit, fix the plumbin'
Bare with me y'all, I'm this close (This close)
Spent my whole life chasin' chips, where's Nabisco? (Where's Nabisco?)
My past memories, I miss those (Miss those)
Hey, all I can say is you get what you wish for

[Chorus: Chris Brown & T.I.]
If anybody feeling fresh in the building
Take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn, I'm killing them, damn, I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now
And if you too fresh in the building
Then take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn, I'm killing them, damn, I'm killing them (Let's get it, let's go)
I know they feeling me now (Ayy)

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I'm fresh off my pit-stop, flow airtight with no Ziploc (Bah!)
Get shit pop when my shit drop (Bah!), no hip-hop, this Tip hop (Yeah)
I'm back standin' at the tip top where I belong, it won't be long
'Til you hear me on a B.o.B song (Ahh), some chick gettin' my skeet on (Skeet)
To touch the sole of my feet, G, you gon' have to get your reach on (Ah)
I'm up all the way high, all the way fly, on the ground, I'm off the radar
Bernie Madoff money, dawg, got killers paid off with it all
I got the juice (Hello), could you place a call and we place a call to who place a call (Go)
Don't get your part and not too hard, I disregard what you say (Yeah)
Back up the truck and pass the buck, here's where it's stoppin' today
Got swag all on me, homie, can't wipe it away, we too ill, ill
That's how we got arenas, domes and stadiums filled
Ayy, how you feel?

[Chorus: Chris Brown & B.o.B]
If anybody feeling fresh in the building
Take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn, I'm killing them, damn, I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now (Damn right)
And if you too fresh in the building (In the building)
Then take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now (High, high, high, high)
And say damn, I'm killing them (Damn), damn, I'm killing them (Damn)
I know they feeling me now (Yeah)

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
And I'm still here in a black whip full of Strange Clouds (Full of Strange Clouds)
And I'm still here with the same team, nigga, stay down
Still here for the East Side, ain't a thang change but the bank 'count (East Side, ha!)
Hands high when I come 'round 'cause I'm killin' this shit nigga, hands down (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
And I go hard, my passport's like a postcard (Ha)
Give a fuck if I'm solo, I'll go toe-to-toe with your whole squad (Yes)
With the soul of a soldier but even still, I don't want no parts
And no niggas with no hearts, you cocksuckers need throat guards
I'm throwed off for the most part, a young dog with an old bark (Woof)
Flow dumb, but I'm so smart, I compose art, call me Mozart
My nightlife's like a soap opera with two chicks like it's Noah's ark
They got nice dresses with no bras with good bodies like, "Oh God" (Oh God)
From a poor child to on top like a mohawk (Ha)
But I always knew I'd go far like a gas truck with no park (No park)
So no applause (No applause), hold the applause
Just put your hand up if you know the song

[Chorus: Chris Brown & B.o.B]
If anybody feeling fresh in the building (In the building)
Take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn, I'm killing them, damn, I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now
And if you too fresh in the building
Then take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn, I'm killing them, damn, I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now
If anybody feeling fresh in the building
Take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn, I'm killing them, damn, I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now
And if you too fresh in the building
Then take your hand, hold it high to the ceiling right now
And say damn, I'm killing them, damn, I'm killing them
I know they feeling me now

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Everything I ever said
Everything that I have done
Tryna show 'em it's my time
Building mansions in my mind
Now that's all so yesterday
I'm just lighting up my fire
Tell the world I'm saying goodbye
You ask me why
(Yeah, ha) Wh—y—y—y?
I'm building castles in the sky
I'm building castles in the sky

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I used to ride around town in a whatcha call it
Looking like a demo rapper, feeling like a dusty wallet
Getting fired, then hired, then re-fired
The Idiot's Guide to how to build an empire
I show you how to stunt, show you how to pop
Got a watch for my wrist and a watch for my Pops
Ballin' from the baseline, bottom to the top
Got bullets on speed-dial, yeah, I call shots
Now you can't act like you never heard of me
'Cause I'm so third degree everyday I'm burning leaves
I'm in my castle and I'm never coming down
They always said I had my head in the clouds
Ha!

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Everything I ever said
Everything that I have done
Tryna show 'em it's my time
Building mansions in my mind
Now that's all so yesterday
I'm just lighting up my fire
Tell the world I'm saying goodbye ... goodbye..
Why...
I'm building castles in the sky
Haa, haa, haa
Haa, haa, haa
Haa, haa, haa, haa
I'm building castles in the sky

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
I use to fantasize about the baddest girl I couldn't get with
Couldn't get her number, couldn't even get a digit
Then I saw the light, now my nights are quite explicit
I be lost inside the ganja, would’ve sworn I went missing
Got bills paid
Got the whole hood saying, "Damn, Bobby Ray done came a mighty long way"
No GPS, OnStar or navigation
We some self made niggas, shout out to my operation
It started in my mind then it started taking shape
I still cannot believe that these events are taking place
I'm in my castle and I'm never coming down
It's no wonder why my head is in the clouds
Ha!

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Everything I ever said
Everything that I have done
Tryna show 'em it's my time
Building mansions in my mind
Now that's all so yesterday
I'm just lighting up my fire
Tell the world I'm saying goodbye
Why...
I'm building castles in the sky
Haa, haa, haa
Haa, haa, haa
Haa, haa, haa, haa
I'm building castles in the sky

[Bridge: B.o.B]
Building castles the size of colosseums
Thirty thousand feet up, I swear you gotta see 'em
Cruising altitude with a foolish attitude
Headed for the moon, maybe Mars, maybe Venus
Building castles the size of collesiums
Thirty thousand feet up, I swear you gotta see 'em
Cruising altitude with a foolish attitude
Headed for the moon maybe Mars, maybe Venus

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Everything I ever said
Everything that I have done
Tryna show 'em it's my time
Building mansions in my mind
Now that's all so yesterday
I'm just lighting up my fire
Tell the world I'm saying goodbye... goodbye
Why...
I'm building castles in the sky
Haa, haa, haa..
Haa, haa, haa..
Haa, haa, haa, haa..
I'm building castles in the sky

[Bridge: B.o.B]
Building castles the size of colosseums
Thirty thousand feet up, I swear you gotta see 'em
Cruising altitude with a foolish attitude
Headed for the moon, maybe Mars, maybe Venus

[Verse 1]
But she the type of girl drive the whole hood crazy
Little Red Riding Hood riding M80’s
The type of girl that will probably be famous
Hollywood superstar, magazine pages
Apparently she had a thing for a nigga
Unfortunately the nigga wasn’t me
Nowadays she’s the life of the party
Glamorous and glossy, taking photos in the VIP

[Hook]
Now I’m like damn, wow look at you now
You got the whole world chasing you down
Miss Marry mack, mack, mack y'all
Dressed in black, black, black
With a rude attitude-tude-tude
And tattoos down your back, back, back

[Hook 2]
But still you run circles through my head (circles through my head)
Circles through my head (circles through my head)
There she goes again (There she goes again)
And there she goes again (There she goes again)
I just wanna get to know ya
But you turn the other shoulder
And there she goes again (There she goes again)
Running circles through my head (circles through my head)

[Verse 2]
Running circles through my membrane
Top speed, she don't shift gears, switch lanes on it
I haven’t seen ya in a minute
But the hands of time show me it’s some good thangs for ya
Like a A list celebrity, they ain’t gotta see ID
Cuz nowadays she’s the life of the party
Glamorous and glossy, taking photos in the VIP

It's the last words she said to me
Now I'm wishin' she was still here with me
(You're gonna need me, need me one day)
And now that day's here, your man gotta shed tears, right?!
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)

You never miss a good thing 'til it leaves ya
And finally, I realize that I need ya

[Verse 2: Usher & Sample]
If I could rewind the time and get inside your mind
I would take back all my words
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)
I didn't see it
I couldn't see what I was doin', babe (Oh)
See, baby girl, I was blind and I wish I could try

To be the man that you deserve
Give me one chance to make it work, (Ah, baby)

[Chorus: Usher]
It's drivin' me crazy (It's drivin' me crazy)

Now I'm wishin' she was still here with me
(You're gonna need me, need me one day)
Now that day's here, your man gotta shed tears
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)
I'm sittin' by the phone
Realizin' she ain't ever coming home
(Oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh)
(You're gonna need me, need me one day)
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)

[Intro]
What's up, baby?
I'm so glad I got you here
I'm so in love with you
And I don't ever wanna lose you
I wanna take this to the next level
I hope you ready

[Verse 1]
Now that you're here
I got something to say, baby
I think that you should know
You're doing the most, sugar (sugar)
So don't worry 'bout the situation (situation)
I'd never let you go

[Chorus]
Can you handle it, if I go there, baby, with you?
I can handle it, I can go there, baby, with you
(Oh, I hear you talking, babe)
Can you handle it, can I go there, baby, with you?
We gon' set it off, we gon' tear it up
Baby, can you handle?

[Bridge 1]
Wooooo, baby
You say all the time you only want the best of my love
Now I can see that there's only one way to tear it up, yeah
I'm willing to tell you everything I let stand between us
But what if I tell you too much?

[Verse 2]
What about you, babe?
Will you tell me all the freaky things you are?
Before I do, need you to know
If we make it through, our love will grow
Ahh ah-oh, imagine how amazing things would be

[Chorus]
Can you handle it, can I go there, baby, with you?
We gon' set it off, we gon' tear it up
Baby, can you handle?
I can handle it, I can go there, baby, with you
(Oh, I hear you talking, babe)
We gon' set it out, we gon' work it out
Baby, can you handle?

[Bridge 2]
Wooooo, ah yeah baby
I fear sometimes in my mind
That you won't wanna stay with my love
Oh baby, if I can be sure
Inside out that you know exactly the man that comes to see you
I'll go deep as I can
Giving you the rest of my love
But what if I tell you too much?

[Break]
So much to explore
So much we have yet to discover
I ask myself, "Should I go there?
Should I do it?" (Yeah, oh, oh oh)
Can I give it to you fully?
Can you handle it?

[Chorus]
Can you handle it, if I go there, baby, with you? (Can I go there?)
We gon' lay it out, we gon' tear it up
Baby, can you handle?
I can handle it, I can go there, baby, with you
We gon' set it out, we gon' work it out
Baby, can you handle?

[Outro]
Can you handle it, can I go there, baby, with you?
We gon' set it off, we gon' tear it up
Baby, can you handle? (Oh, I need to know)
We gon' set it out, we gon' work it out
Baby can you handle? (Can you handle it?)
Can you handle it, can I go there, baby, with you?
We gon' set it off, we gon' tear it up
Baby, can you handle?
We gon' set it out, we gon' work it out
Baby can you handle?

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Part of me won't go away
Every day, reminded how much I hate it
Weighed it against the consequences
Can't live without it, so it's senseless
Wanna cut it out of my soul
And just live with the gaping hole
Take control of my life and wash out all the burnt taste
I made the problems in the first place
Hang my head low 'cause it's part of me
You hardly see right next to the heart of me
Hurting me, the wounds soon scar
New cuts cover where the old ones are
And now I'm sick of this
I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts that grate on my sanity
I rather not even be
Than the man that's staring in the mirror through me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it
Once it's been dealt with
You feel like you've been touched by something angelic
And then melted down into a pool of peace
Cease to be the animal you used to be
Remove the broken parts you know were wrong
And feel the calm when the problem's all gone
And then you start to see
Another piece of yourself that you can't let be
Memories of the last fight to free yourself
Taken to the depths of the bottom of the well
And now you know that you can choose
To lose the part in your heart where your insides bruise
You can live if you're willing to
Put a stop to just what's killing you

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me
Cut myself free willingly, stop just what's killing me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(Alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams away silently)
(Alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams away silently)
This part of me won't go away (Alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams away silently)
Part of me won't go away (Alive in me, inside of me)
(A part of me screams away silently)

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
Everywhere I look around, I see how everything ought to be
Every time I see myself, there's always something wrong with me
Everywhere I look around, I see how everything ought to be
Every time I see myself, there's always something wrong with me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me
I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me
I feel it swell up inside
Swell up inside, swallowing me
We're gonna kick 'em out

Well, I feel pretty good
And I guess that I could get crazy now, baby
We all got in tune
When the dressing room got hazy

I know how you want it
When you're hot and tight
The girl can't stand it
When you do it right
When you're up on the stand
Let me kick out the jams
Kick out the jams, we're gonna kick 'em out

And I'm startin' to sweat
You know my shirt's all wet
What a feeling now, baby
The sound that abound and resounds and rebounds straight off of the ceilin'
You gotta have it, baby
You can't do without
You get that feelin', gotta kick 'em out
Put that mic in my hand
And let me kick out the jams
Kick out the jams, we gotta kick 'em out
Alright, alright, alright, all

Gotta give it up
You know you can't get enough, Miss McKenzie
'Cause it gets in your brain
And it drives you insane a loopy frenzy
The wigglin' guitar and a crash on the drums
We wanna keep on rockin' 'til the mornin' comes
Let me be who I am
And let me kick out the jams
Yeah, kick out the jams
I done kicked 'em out

[Intro: Ryan Tedder]
1, 2, 3

[Chorus: B.o.B]
They can take these clothes off my back
They can take my money
Don't care about that
Let them take my words
It’s all I've got
They can have this fame
It ain't worth a lot
Only thing I know, is I'll never let you go

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
As she takes the stand
By the look in her eyes I can tell that’s she knows
That she’s holding the fate of my world in her hands
Damn, fo’ real
This was never the plan
It was never intended for her to end up the defendant
And I guess it just happened by chance
Damn, and you hope
You hopin’ that a miracle happens
You prayed that the Judge doesn't bang that gavel
Just so you can go back and avoid a disaster
And you could still be holding her hand
Like the last note of the saddest song
We’re like the last word at the end of the poem
You know, sometimes there's nothing worse than being alone
It’s funny how you never know what you got ‘til it’s gone

[Chorus: B.o.B]
They can take these clothes off my back
They can take my money
Don't care about that
Let them take my words
It’s all I've got
They can have this fame
It ain't worth a lot
Only thing I know, is I'll never let you go

[Refrain: B.o.B]
Won’t let you go
No, never gonna let you go
Won’t let you go
No, never gonna let you go
Won’t let you go
No, never gonna let you go
Won’t let you go
No, never gonna let you go

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
What’s the one thing in this life that you live for?
Who do you know in the world you would die for?
Who would lie for?
Who if they committed a crime you would stop on a dime and do time for
'Cause it was me she would lie for
And that was her that I cried for
Now I’d give it all away to get her back
'Cause she ain’t free, no, this ain’t no July 4th
Yea, no, it don’t sound logical
But there’s some things in this life that you gotta do
Brother, one thing in this world that got to you
I’d let it all go but I ain’t dropping you

[Chorus: B.o.B]
They can take these clothes off my back
They can take my money
Don't care about that
Let them take my words
It’s all I've got
They can have this fame
It ain't worth a lot
Only thing I know, is I'll never let you go

[Refrain: B.o.B]
Won’t let you go
No, never gonna let you go
Won’t let you go
No, never gonna let you go
Won’t let you go
No, never gonna let you go
Won’t let you go
No, never gonna let you go

[Outro]
It might be wrong or it might be right
But there’s no looking back and we won’t sleep tonight
We’re living while we’re young and this is worth the fight
Even if I lost it all

[Chorus: B.o.B]
They can take these clothes off my back
They can take my money
Don't care about that
Let them take my words
It’s all I've got
They can have this fame
It ain't worth a lot
Only thing I know, is I'll never let you go

[Refrain: B.o.B]
Won’t let you go
No, never gonna let you go
Won’t let you go
No, never gonna let you go
Won’t let you go
No, never gonna let you go
Won’t let you go
No, never gonna let you go

[Hook]
How much must I repeat? We only play for keeps
No time-outs, no free throws, no refs, no penalties
No handouts, no pit stops, no cheat codes, no sleep
But the drinks are on us, if you with it then pull up a seat

[Verse 1]
When you’re roaming through the jungle talk is nothing, talk is cheap
Time is money, money is power, power corrupts eventually, damn
So what are the options? What are the choices left for me?
What other rule is left to break? I guess my fate is a quest for me
Man I’m a dog that ain’t got no leash
Man got a crib, it ain’t got no lease
Man got a flow that ain't got no brain
But I still get brain, no hands no teeth, uh
Nowadays, niggas are killas on the beat
But where I was raised all of the killas was down the street
Better do your research
Feeling like I fell out of the sky and landed feet first
My squad go hard, my squad go concrete, watch my team work
Hell yea, you can tell that the boy finna eat cause I took my seat first
3 course meal, full entrée, refills and I want my dessert
So why not make a toast? Tomorrow could always be worse
Now keep them bottles coming by the kiloliter
And get that Ana off your chest, try to keep a clean shirt
I’m so Grand Hustle, you ain’t even in my league sir
What’s up with these nerds?
They be out here, gettin’ their salads tossed, gettin’ their leaves turned
The game just ain’t what it used to be, the quality is blurred
But a dying breed survives and a dynasty emerged
So put it in the air if you entirely concur
She call me hippie cause I live without any concern
Up on this green earth, I’m on them green herbs
Yeah yeah, yeah, I stay in them trees like the Keeblers
And they say that I look higher in person
As a kid I played in the yard, but now I’m astro turfing
I lived the actual version of the fantasies they utter
Made up stories of threesomes, they must just be seeing double
Run for cover, here comes trouble
My heart is going cold so I gotta sleep with warmer covers
Polar bear pimpin’, solar flare spittin’
Somebody tell ‘em that this is professional stuntin’, don’t attempt it
Society is twisted, they tryna take us under
So when you see them folks, don’t forget to warn a brother
I made it out alive but still the battle is a struggle
Veni, vidi, vici, I came, I saw, I conquered
They mad cause I murdered the game
And their name wasn’t in the will
You see, most of these haters are mad rappers who just still waiting on a deal
And they jealous of my success cause my shoes cost more than a bill
But I’ll never sit down at another table unless I’m invited to the meal
To some it’s like conquering mountains, to me it’s like stepping on hills
Remember the images in your mirror can be bigger than they appear
And the truth can be hard to swallow, depends on the size of the pill
And by the looks it’s about the time that you had your prescription filled
My life, full length feature presentation
There are no intermissions, no time for commercial breaking
A fighter in his prime, a legend in the making
There’s no debating when you let your numbers make the statement

[Hook]

[Hook: Lauriana Mae]
Hold me when I’m down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating
Shining like a chandelier

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
What’s a song if it don’t have words?
What’s the word if it don’t get heard
You can paint it anyway that you like
How can you get the picture if it come out blurred
What life taught me can’t be unlearned
And every bridge can’t be unburned
You can’t wait ‘til you get your turn
I could try to make it home but you’re still on third
Look, your whole life need a renovation
Yea, let me give you a demonstration
No limitations, no intimidations
I’m tryna live good, that’s an understatement
They say life’s about choices
In the face of defeat I declined
Put your soul into everything, never back down
That’s how you leave a legacy behind

[Hook: Lauriana Mae]
Hold me when I’m down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating
Shining like a chandelier

[Hook: Lauriana Mae]
Hold me when I’m down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating
Shining like a chandelier

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
The world don’t stop so we don’t quit
The show goes on, tomorrow’s here today
So live your life and do your thing
Enjoy each moment, it could slip away
Cause nothing is promised, nothing is free
There ain't no receipts or guarantees
When it’s done, there will be no severance fee
Just a far away dream you’ve yet to reach
That’s why you have to go all out for it
No half-time, gotta ball out for it
Full court press, life is the test
Can’t play sick, can’t call out for it
Cause I don’t wanna fall, no skydive
Stand tall through it all, that’s a high rise
Make a something out of absolutely nothing
That’s the definition of a survivor

[Hook: Lauriana Mae]
Hold me when I’m down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating
Shining like a chandelier

[Hook: Lauriana Mae]
Hold me when I’m down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating
Shining like a chandelier

[Bridge: Lauriana]
So let me be like the trees
Where I can rustle my leaves
To join the wind in the sky
If this was all a mistake, I’d rather leave this place
Than be a breathing lie

[Hook: Lauriana Mae]
Hold me when I’m down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating
Shining like a chandelier

[Bridge 2]
Just keep me shining like a chandelier
Just keep me shining like a chandelier

[Hook: Lauriana Mae]
Hold me when I’m down
Bury my soul underneath the ground
Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating
Shining like a chandelier

[Hook 1: B.o.B]
Looking at the world through my rear-view
Searching for an answer up high
But is it all wasted time?
Everything is crumbling around me
Feels like the ending of the times
Or is it all just a sign?

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Uh, I dozed off in my notebook
Ever since, never woke up
Hey, I've been traveling for lifetimes
Still I got many miles before it's over
Yeah, I kept it hundred like I'm suppose to
But everything in the world ain't kosher
See it's crazy when your friends turn to strangers
But then strangers running up like they know you
And the further away from reality I go
I can feel the truth getting closer
But hey, it's a path that we all on
If you in the fast lane or the slow one
And you might break down on the shoulder
You just gotta know who to call for the tow-truck
I guess we all gotta exit to the next boulevard when the road's up

[Hook 2: B.o.B]
Looking at the world through my rear-view
Searching for an answer up high
But is it all wasted time?
Simulated automated breakthroughs
Everything appears to be fine
Or are we all digitized?
Everything is crumbling around me
Feels like the ending of the times
Or is it all just a sign?

[Interlude: Playboy Tre]
Yeah, sometimes
Sometimes I'm wondering if what I'm seeing in front of me
Is even real

[Verse 2: Playboy Tre]
Yeah, gon' roll up some of that killa
We call this slasher smoking
Gone off those Michael Myers
I can barely keep my lashes open
6 shots of the rum I'm done
Thinking about my partners death
I'm angry, in a flash he was gone
Man how can that day not rearrange me
All of my days, they cloudy
All of my nights, they rowdy
He told me "'Tre keep suckers in your rear view"
If so I´m smashing proudly
Is it all in my head?
Am I just wasting time?
All of my rear-view mirror
Looking for answers 'bout to lose my mind

[Hook 3: B.o.B]
Looking at the world through my rear-view
Searching for an answer up high
But is it all wasted time?
Simulated automated breakthroughs
Everything appears to be fine
Or are we all digitized?
They say you only get one life time
Then it's gone in a blink of an eye
Or is it all just in my mind?
Everything is crumbling around me
Feels like the ending of the times
Or is it all just a sign?

[Bridge: B.o.B]
I saw the lights dancing up so high
I wonder is it really a sign?
Or just imagination, imagination
As golden rivers flooded off the sky
Pouring from the sands of time
Congratulations, we finally made it
I saw the lights dancing up so high
I wonder is it really a sign?
Or just imagination, imagination
As golden rivers flooded off the sky
Pouring from the sands of time
Congratulations, we finally made it

[Hook 3: B.o.B]
Looking at the world through my rear-view
Searching for an answer up high
But is it all wasted time?
Simulated automated breakthroughs
Everything appears to be fine
Or are we all digitized?
They say you only get one life time
Then it's gone in a blink of an eye
Or is it all just in my mind?
Everything is crumbling around me
Feels like the ending of the times
Or is it all just a sign?

[Intro]
Whoaa
Bitch you know my name
Leggo
It's Mr. Tremaine

[Verse]
Ladies love me, here go that new Trey
Kiss and suck me, I call it toupee
I got on Breezy shit, give my shit a break
Fuck am I talking bout? Aye peedis get my spins up
Love faces, Bottoms up
Came straight from the bottom up
Who you gon' find at the top of the charts that hot as fuck and these broads'll fuck?
Ya'll niggas pick my garbage up
Say my prayers, in god we trust
Know I gotta lot of money so these niggas acting funny
Gotta turn the Cadillac into an armor truck
Bitch nigga on the arm of her
So I look her in her eye, start charming her
Wanna know you very well, pretty skin caramel and a nigga tryna bust that almond nut
Chi-Town freak hoes, cold as a bitch though
Came in a trench coat, took it off, beach clothes
Get naked, right this second
Girl you ain't nothing but a bird, just peck it
Watch full of carrots with a pocket full of lettuce
While you hating niggas ride 87 and alet it
I hope your shit break down, look at a nigga now

[Hook]
Look at me now (x3)
I'm getting paper

[Verse 2]
VA I did it for ya'll
But the two audemars I did it to ball
High school couldn't keep me out the halls
Pretty bitch couldn't keep me out her draws
Shitting on ya'll, treat the game like a star
Drown in the water while you hang from my balls
My clothes don't hang in the mall
This shit fresh off from the plane from Milan
Good head, can't name the salon
But I swear I just came in her mind
Gotta her hiding in a plane in the morning
Gave her two pills, don't blame me I'm wrong
Why the fuck they let me on this song?
I don't even care who own this song
Chris could've called me, man you should've called me
Man, god damn I love this song
Let's talk about the way I got on this John
We was in the garage and I got on that bong
A nigga said Wayne went nuts and I think I went, what my nuts are over-grown
I'm so high, I'm overblown
Think I'm overdosing on
My ego, I'm so lethal
There's no equal, I'm so evil, No Knievel
But I stunt hard, my front yard - got horses
Think that porches from midevil
There's no way this can be legal
200 while I'm blunted
And her mouth just keep on running
Cause the weave they've just done and
So I told the bitch to bun it
Yeah, 

[?] let the track drop
Murder the shit like Black Ops
Flap jackers and claymores
In this one year, I made more
Than the whole existence of yours
Nigga, just got my voice insured
Yeah, look at me now, bitch

[Hook]
Look at me now (x3)
I'm getting paper
Look at me now (x3)
Yeah, look at me now, bitch

[Intro]
Haha
I'm on my shit right now, boy
That's me playin' the guitar too
Yeah, multi-talented, motherfucker
Haha, ayo, Jerm, I'm 'bout to go in, haha, uh

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
My style's dumb, clownin' fools, hittin' the playground
Stuntin' is a habit, gotta stunt it if you have it
I be pumpin' out beats that leave you jumpin' like a rabbit
You a dipstick, doofus, numbnuts, nuisance
I'm too sick, doctors think the swine flu hit
Move with a groove like the moon man
Grab a lady if you wanna do a dance
If I'm here, who the fuck gon' monitor hell?
I keep a shorty on her knees, 'bout as tall as my belt (Haha)

[Chorus]
Laugh now, cry later, hi, hater, I be gettin' it in
Got some shit to do and I'm in the mood
You wait a minute, I'ma get it again

[Verse 2]
Uh
Comin' straight from the belly of the beast
Bringin' peace to your chi, we remember the deceased
Pour some liquor on the street
Hoppin' out the bed, the sun rise like east
Brush my teeth, I at least need to grab a bite to eat
Walk down the stairs, kiss my momma on the cheek
Before I walk up out the door, let my feet create a beat
On the street that I'm steppin' on, matter fact glidin'
Climbin' out the atmosphere to travel back from Zion
People look at me a different way
Now they listen when I got a little shit to say
Shit has changed since the old days when I was a youngin
Shit, I'm still a youngin' but I'm spittin' like it's nothin'
Would've thought I had a hundred years under my belt
And if you hatin', you just fuckin' yourself (Haha)
I'm the kid they call the life of the party
Glass of ice and Bacardi get me right so I'm probably
Swervin', I see you spittin' game and it's hurtin'
The precision of a surgeon when the hoes come in, searchin'
I'm just goin' with the flow like it's current
Watchin' my back for all you snakes and you serpents
Lurkin', jealous don't work and you selfish
Laughin' in your face and lightin' up the purple relish
Label me a man who make weed jams
Mad 'cause I'm writin' while I'm liftin' up a mountain with my free hand
You a little jackass, call you Wee Man
Nah, fuck that, I'ma call the weed man

[Riff]

[Verse 1]
What is this that stands before me?
Figure in black which points at me
Turn 'round quick and start to run
Find out I'm the chosen one
Oh, no

[Verse 2]
Big black shape with eyes of fire
Telling people their desire
Satan's sitting there, he's smiling
Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh, no, no, please, God, help me

[Outro]
Is it the end, my friend?
Satan's coming 'round the bend
People running 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware
No, no, please, no

[Verse 1]
Did you know that you could be wrong
And swear you’re right?
Some people been known to do it
All their lives
But you find yourself alone
Just like you found yourself before
Like I found myself in pieces
On the hotel floor
Hard times help me see

[Chorus]
I’m a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I’m right here, and I’m right now
And I’m hoping, knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now

[Verse 2]
Well I'm no trouble maker
And I never meant her harm
But it doesn’t mean I didn’t make it
Hard to carry on
Well it sucks to be honest (honest)
And it hurts to be real
But it's nice to make some love
That I can finally feel
Hard times let me be

[Chorus]
I’m a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I’m right here, and I’m right now
And I’m hoping, knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now

I’m a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I’m right here, and I’m right now
And I’m hoping, knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now

[Hook]
I’m looking through you like an x-ray
I’m trying to figure if your love’s fake
Give or take, couple days
Should I wait? Am I late?
Thinking hard, got me going insane

[Verse 1]
Beaming through your door
I see right through your faults
Eyes tryna feed me more lies
Girl I’m on top, of all your little side plans
All your little side mans
All in for your waist and I must have been out my mind

[Pre-Hook]
Girl you had to be so slick to go through all them
Bad dudes, had to be the first to stop you cause

[Hook]
I’m looking through you like an x-ray
I’m trying to figure if your love’s fake
Give or take, couple days
Should I wait? Am I late?
Thinking hard, got me going insane
I’m looking through you like an x-ray
I’m trying find out if your heart breaks
Can it break? Is it fake?
Should I wait? Am I late?
Thinking hard, got me going insane

[Verse 2]
Running through them boys
You play me like a toy
And 'bout to here that noise
When I find out your thoughts girl
Sweating on the outside shaking on the inside
Girl I’m reading your mind
And it's filled with lies

[Pre-Hook]
Girl you had to be so slick to go through all them
Bad dudes, had to be the first to stop you cause

[Hook]
I’m looking through you like an x-ray

Can it break? Is it fake?
Should I wait? Am I late?
Thinking hard, got me going insane

Girl you're out of love
Girl you know you're out of love so
Pack up all your stuff
Girl you had your chance
But this time, this time was your last

[Hook]
I’m looking through you like an x-ray
I’m trying to figure if your love’s fake
Give or take, couple days
Should I wait? Am I late?
Thinking hard, got me going insane

I’m trying find out if your heart breaks
Can it break? Is it fake?
Should I wait? Am I late?
Thinking hard, got me going insane

I got a riddle: what's little and talks big
With midget arms and creamy white fillin' in the middle
That will do anything to throw dirt on my name
If it means walkin' the whole Mediterranean?
Is he an Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian? No!
His name's Raymond and, oh, so sorry, yo, Osorio
But that was a long time ago when I was just Joe Shmoe
Rappin' in Joe Blows basement, I apologized for it befo', so
Either accept it or you don't and let's move on
If I've shown that I've grown and get the bone
Keep lickin' these nuts you industry mutts
Keep walkin' around sniffin' each other's butts
Or should I say asses?
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses?

[Lloyd Banks & Eminem]
Hold on, hold on, hold p
New York city man
It's the kid Lloyd Banks
And if you hearin' what I'm hearin' right now
You know this ain't no regular shit homie
This somethin' special, and we gotta bring this back
Green, come on
Countdown to **Armaggedon! Let's go!**

[Hook: Eminem]
I got a riddle, what's little and talks big
With midget arms and creamy white fillin' in the middle
That will do anything to throw dirt on my name
If it means walkin' the whole Mediterranean?
Is he an Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian? No!
It's Dave Raymond and oh, so sorry yo, Osorio
But that was a long time ago when I was just Joe Shmoe
Rappin' in Joe Blows basement, I apologized for it befo', so
Either accept it or you don't and let's move on
If I've shown that I've grown and get the bone
Keep lickin' these nuts you industry mutts
Keep walkin' around sniffin' each other's butts
Or should I say asses?
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
The question I ask is: how can I explain this?
How can I swing this in English language
If I switch to slang and turn man to mayn
Do I do it in vain or simply to entertain?
Am I being real or am I being fake?
Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine?
Or am I caught up in this hot water? Wody on my daughter
I told ya I love this culture, don't let em' insult ya
I'ma tell ya one more 'gain, this is the environment that I was brought up in
But every now and then I use my pen to get rid of some frustration
Or should I say shun?
Is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism, huh?
Your face is numb, you're stunned, your look is cold
Like that of a man of seventy-some-years-old
And it only gets colder, which Is why I understand
And can't be mad at a forty-four-year-old fan
With a chip on his shoulder, who only owns a half of a magazine
And the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again
Only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown
Papa can't stand me, papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down
In his new chair that goes round and round
That he bought from new money in his bank account
That I get him every issue when the thang comes out
Sit back, and let his puffy clown hair come out
And let his black side arm wrestle his white side
Yell "Apartheid" loud enough that he might slide
He might find someone dumb enough who might ride
But ain't nobody over here buyin' two white guys disguised as pro-black
There is no slack
Far heart for college grad in a fitted hat and a hunch back
Standin' by the clearance coat rack
In some old slacks and some RSO throwbacks
Yeah

[Outro: Eminem]
Shady in the place to be, see
And it takes what I got to rock the mic, right!
Still not gonna cater these punks
Fuckin' cocksuckin' pussy lips haters dicks cunts!

[Verse 1]
Every single night, I endure the flight
Of little wings of white-flamed butterflies in my brain
These ideas of mine percolate the mind
Trickle down the spine, swarm the belly, swellin' to a blaze

[Pre-Chorus]
That's where the pain comes in like a second skeleton
Tryin' to fit beneath the skin, I can't fit the feelings in, oh

[Chorus]
Every single night's alight with my brain, brain

[Verse 2]
I say to her, why'd I say it to her?
What does she think of me? That I'm not what I ought to be
That I'm what I try not to be, it's got to be somebody else's fault
I can't get caught

[Pre-Chorus]
If what I am is what I am 'cause I does what I does
Then brother get back, 'cause my breast's gonna bust open
The rib is the shell, and a heart is the yolk
And I just made a meal for us both to choke on

[Chorus]
Every single night's a fight with my brain, brain

[Refrain]
I just wanna feel everything
I just wanna feel everything
I just wanna feel everything

[Verse 3]
So now I'm gonna try to be still now
Gonna renounce the mill a little while
And if we had a double-king-sized bed
We could move in it, and I'd soon forget

[Pre-Chorus]
That what I am is what I am 'cause I does what I does
And maybe I'd relax, let my breast just bust open
My heart's made of parts of all that surround me
And that's why the devil just can't get around me

[Chorus]
Every single night's alright, every single night's a fight
And every single fight's alright with my brain, brain

[Refrain]
I just wanna feel everything
I just wanna feel everything
I just wanna feel everything
I just wanna feel everything

[Tyga]
(Intro)
Hahaha Yeeeah
Umm, I presume you already know what this is
A Young Money, G.E.D, Decaydance Production
Well, I didn't make the beat
But I'm gone make the beat
I'mma lose all my knowledge since preschool and get silly

[Verse]
My advance check got the bank teller depressed
My publishing check made the IRS check
My fucking alias like who the fuck is this
Student who didn't go to college but forever set
Fuck a Standford 9 test, a Standford 9 test?
What the fuck is that when you steady got stacks on deck
I spazz wit the tats, California on my neck
Gold shapes swing of the center of my chest
I don't trip on these chicks, tell em there n-n-n-nothin
To a man getting rich with a motion picture budget
Flying motion with no potion, sober, I dearly does it
I never went to class studying cash was my subject
I love it, how does it feel to pay the bills before your mother
Bread like wonder, make her wonder why they flourish
For little human thunder, I explain thoroughly to her
Easily they download and discover like researchers
Research the hard workers, I work hard for the skill murder
Still hunger, you didn't hear it when I deliver
Like fast food burgers, in and out burger
In and out yo sis brother
My black brothers stop hatin it ain't worth it
Like penny savers, ya'll niggas ain't bout nothin
Like dry humpin, before that shit I was the shit
Call it predumpin, eat dumplins, never done it
I'm too youngin like put putin
I get paid off clubs, tiger woods shit tyga good
Understood before they knew me thirty thou crowds
Like stood, understand couple of years I will
Be the fucking man

[Intro: Afroman]
I got another one
What you call a hooker with a runny nose?
Full!
Hey you like that shit?
When a hooker is young she uses vaseline
What she use when she gets old?
Polygrip!
Hahahahaha

[Hook]
Afroman
I'm in your pussy
Bumpin up against yer ass
With my left hand I'm rubbin up on your titties
With my right I'm smokin grass

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Afroman]
Afroman Palmdale, Cali get high desert
Any dope valley
When I was a boy I couldn't find a girl
Now I got women all over the world
Like Naughty Nancy from North Carolina
Back n forth in her hot vagina
Is your pussy sore?
She said kinda... She came!
People heard her screaming in China
Big Jug June down in Peru
Sucked me till my dick shrivelled up like a prune
10 minutes later my dicks high point
June smoked it like a joint
Your daughters fucked
You caught her yelling
I gotta rotate
In Cape Carteret
Doing the dime at the time
Drinking my jizz like colt 45

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2: Afroman]
Molly, Molly Blanchete
Licked my dick like a Jolly Rancher
Drove her home from Warlington
Stuck it in her pussy cause I ain't done
Country singers from Nashville
Shaking ass smoking grass fo real
Jumped in the van with the Dixie Chicks
Checked into motherfucking Motel 6
I flew Holly to Hollywood
Pulled out my wood and fucked her good
Grandma Biggie from Ventura
Drunk ma jizz like Ensura
Dick sucker Sandy from San Diago
Won't let go my lego
So I Gave her my lego
Then I let go my eggo!

[Hook 2x]

Took off her clothes left on the shoes
Bent her over stuffed her stocking
Right before I came I started BAKAWING!
Suck dick Sandy Sent Louis a pispo
Wheres my brand just like nebisko
Suck my dick all the way to Frisco
Came in her face, it looks like crisko
Tried to fuck a girl from Fresno
Baby said she was a lesbo
Unzipped ma pants pulled out ma wood
Took her manhood
I kept on Fucking she started cumming
I be damned she is a woman
She took off her pants and put on a dress
Got AFROMAN tattooed on her breast

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 4: Afroman]
Rimjob Rena Reno Nevada
Took every inch of my enchilada
I don't gamble but I played her slot
Pulled her titties and hit the jackpot
Titanic tits from toothesun
Gave her two daughters and two sons
Betty from Boston Massechusettes
Had a massive ass with two massive tits
I smoked some weed drunk some Bacardi
Gave her my boston teabag party!
Connie connie from Connecticut
Liked to jump into bed and give me head and shit
I gave rachel rachel from missouri
A facial (facial) until her sight was blurry
I fucked veronica from Vermont
Her sister her cousin her mum her aunt!

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 1: Young Cash]

[Rick Ross]

Put my face on it, They think I'm insane
But we rule the world, We came a long way
I thought we'd never make, Man we came a long way

[T-Pain]
Oh I, People do it for you, and you, and you

[Intro]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be, and I'll set you free (Oh yeah)

[Chorus]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

[Verse 2]
Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be completely intertwined
Not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel, it's what I didn't show
So let me be, and I'll set you free

[Chorus]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me (Oh yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back, yeah

[Bridge]
You say your faith is shaken, and you may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused, so far away from you
I'm getting there, I don't care where I have to roam

[Refrain]
Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah
Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah

[Intro]
Yeah
Let me crack open my High Life real quick (Big Jerm)
Product placement, haha
Uh, uh, let's go

[Chorus]
Let's take it to the top now, to the top now, baby
I'ma take my time
Through rain, sleet, snow, I'ma keep gettin' dough
You can find me on my grind
So put your muthafuckin' hands in the sky
And if you sittin' down, please stand (Uh-huh)
'Cause I'm on the rise and I reside in this castle made of sand (Look, uh)

[Verse 1]
Let me get a hand clap, I'ma make an entrance (What?)
Givin' y'all the lecture, then I'm takin' questions
My soul a sword, write a sentence, make a weapon
Swimmin' in the deep end, you bitches takin' lessons (Haha)
Then I hear you hatin' on the boy
Well, I ain't offended (Nah)
'Cause I'm the captain of the team and y'all play the benches (Uh-huh)
Still breakin' it down, to rollin' it up
Put an eighthy in the blunt, then I'm smokin' a Dutch
But talk hoes, know I stay with a few
But they replace like the lace in my shoe
So tell me, what a player to do
When bein' real don't appeal to the player in you (Uh-huh)
I've seen some whack cats fast track to the fame
To me, it sound like some clowns rappin' the same
And we, we all livin' for the same thing (Same thing)
Just to make it to the top and remain king (What?)

[Chorus]
Let's take it to the top now, to the top now, baby
I'ma take my time
Through rain, sleet, snow, I'ma keep gettin' dough
You can find me on my grind (Find me on my grind)
So put your muthafuckin' hands in the sky (Hands in the sky)
And if you sittin' down, please stand (Sittin' down, please stand)
'Cause I'm on the rise and I reside in this castle made of sand (One time, look, uh)

[Verse 2]
And you can't name a single youngin' with a flow like mine
Got bars like soap and I glow like shine
If you think that I'm whack, you might change your mind
'Cause I got them punchlines that stain like wine (Ha)
Let me take my time, collect my thoughts
Keep it fresh like shoes when they kept in the box (Uh-huh)
Connect all the dots, I'm fresh, so clean
Stay pinchin' myself 'cause I'm livin' in a dream (Livin' in a dream)
Believe, I ain't never gonna stop
Find a new spot, then I set up my shop (My shop)
When I drop, your wifey gon' cop that (Cop that)
And haters gettin' shaken out they jockstraps (Haha)
Some say I'm bringin' hip-hop back
While others say I'm all up on that pop-rap (Pop-rap)
Team captain, control the game
Goin' hard 'til every single person knows my name

[Chorus]
Let's take it to the top now, to the top now, baby (What?)
I'ma take my time
Through rain, sleet, snow, I'ma keep gettin' dough
You can find me on my grind (Ha)
So put your muthafuckin' hands in the sky (Your hands in the sky)
And if you sittin' down, please stand (Down, please stand)
'Cause I'm on the rise and I reside in this castle made of sand (What? What?)

[Outro]
To the top now, to the top now, baby
Yeah
Mac Miller
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Big Jerm over there on the switches
TreeJ over there just smokin' on the weed
Aha

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Once, we had a love, we had a thing: We were the best of friends
Now we're at the part where we split ways and never speak again
Next, you're gonna find someone new, someone new and
That'll be the end of it (End of it, end of it)

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Once, we had a love, we had a thing: We were the best of friends
Now we're at the part where we split ways and never speak again
Next, you're gonna find someone new, someone new and
That'll be the end of it

[Verse 1]
A pussyfooting setting sun
Make a wish that weighs a tonne
There are no handles for you to hold
And no understanding where it goes

[Verse 2]
Jealousy in technicolor
Fear by name, love by numbers
Street lamp amber, wanderlust
Powder in a blunderbuss

[Chorus]
She looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
And suddenly the sky is a scissor
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don't take it so personally
You're not the only one
That time has got it in for, honey
That's where you're wrong

[Verse 3]
All the old flames fastened on
Make a wish that weighs a tonne
There are no handles you can hold
And no understanding where it goes

[Chorus]
She looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
And suddenly the sky is a scissor
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don't take it so personally
You're not the only one
That time has got it in for, honey
That's where you're wrong

[Outro]
That's where you're wrong
That's where you're wrong
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Black as a beacon in a river of shimmering fog
Yes, she was
If you were heatseeking, she was hard to ignore
Yes, she was

[Chorus]
And she snapped wing mirrors off of Cadillacs
The particular pretty ones
And that meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on

[Verse 2]
Well, time tastes bland
When she's not around
And you'd sit and you'd sink and approach the brink
Before she showed you how to shake love's steady hand
Tha knows

[Chorus]
And she snapped wing mirrors off of Cadillacs
The particular pretty ones
And that meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on

[Bridge]
Shake love's steady hand
Shake love's steady
She floats like a niccy rush and stings like a B-flat
The blond-o-sonic shimmer trap

[Chorus]
And she snapped wing mirrors off of Cadillacs
The particular pretty ones
And that meant she never had to strain her back
When she was putting her lippy on

[Hook]
Ugh, no excuses or apologies
Ain't no way in hell they ain't goin say the I embody this
I be killing every nigga breathing bronchitis's
I be killing every nigga breathing bronchitis's
Let em know
No excuses or apologies
Ain't no way in hell they ain't goin say the I embody this
I be killing every nigga breathing bronchitis's
I be killing every nigga breathing

[Verse]
Fandango my mandingo
We should do a movie
Groupies looking like the yakuza in my Jacuzzi
Excuze me I'm on the ooie
My pockets on life with louie
Euros is different colours my wallet look like a coogi
He who speaking the least is chief keepin the peace
Leaving seeds in your niece
Praying that she ain't late
Spraying like that AK
Now that shit my namesake
Bino you so nasty
Ass like an ash tray
I'm smoking Larry Lotus
Used to be Jehovahs
I'm in your girl and now she feeling polish like perogies
They hoping that they smoke us
Nah dude never that
Tripping off that earwax, Danny Brown and D-Stacks
Ill pandemic, man that shit be everywhere
Midas is your hienus and you haribo like gummy bears
Why I'm fly like cockpit you no fly like ostrich
Stupid shit like a moshpit
Can't believe this is toxic
Ain't goin say that I embody this
You ain't goin say that I embody this
Mutha fucka let em know
You ain't say that I embody this
Mutha fucka tell this mutha fucka dat ain't know
Let em know

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Stepping off that Lear, diamonds on me so clear
Dime hoes that I share, y'all couldn't go near
I say, pussy nigga I dare, you try and reached and get aired
You fuck around and get checked, doctor pump your chest like clear
Yea my niggas ball all year, y'all niggas so square (lame)
And all my niggas so live, why the fuck would I care
When that Lambo flow by, y'all suckas gon' stare
And all them haters gon' hate, fuck them, 'cause all them hoes gon' cheer
Yeah my mic life and my bike life got a bad bitch and she tight and nice
'Cause I'm countin' green in my money machine, that bitch sound like I typewrite
Hustle hard in that daytime but I ball off in that night life
My chain lit with them black stones, but they shine hard as yo white ice
'Cause yo' shit fake and yo shit late, no birthday but I get cake
Lame nigga yo album ain't fucking with my mixtape
Nigga smoking that Cali kush, that shit strong no lift weights
I tell niggas don't watch me while time tick on that big face

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Young nigga I get it, young nigga I get it
Neck full of that gold, gold Rollie go with it
Gold H on my belt, phone full of gold diggers
Sipping gold bottles of Spade, tell them hoes go figure
Young nigga I get it, young nigga I get it
Neck full of that gold, gold Rollie go with it
Gold H on my belt, phone full of gold diggers
Sipping gold bottles of Spade, tell them hoes go figure

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Wake me up and I'm snoring, choking over whole gang of chains
She slept over the morning, a nigga ain't good with this naming game
Ain't need you fucking me over, pyramids on my pinky ring
And we dipping out, she pulling in, I guess she get the hang of things
So what up (what up), I told her shut the fuck up
When I run my mouth diamonds falling out, I guess that bitch done nut up
Crazy thing about it, her best friend is riding shotty
I knocked her down in her 'Rari, then drove off on Ducatti
Holy mother Mary, guess who hitting my Berry
A pair of double D's, I guess she out in Paris
Damn Tony them cantaloupes, fuck about getting Mary
She said her ex was Larry, but fuck that nigga Larry
Damn this shit is scary, I thought I seen the fairy
Fucking with that white milk, just might call it dairy
Ride around just me and Meek, a couple dimes and that's 20
Sit behind while we pull around, we might blind with canaries

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Young nigga I get it, young nigga I get it
Neck full of that gold, gold Rollie go with it
Gold H on my belt, phone full of gold diggers
Sipping gold bottles of Spade, tell them hoes go figure
Young nigga I get it, young nigga I get it
Neck full of that gold, gold Rollie go with it
Gold H on my belt, phone full of gold diggers
Sipping gold bottles of Spade, tell them hoes go figure
She gone!

Can I see you one more time
Before the day I die?
She asked me questions
I asked her "why?"
She said, "I love you"
No reply

But we could've been something special
Just know you always got a special place in my, in my, in my
I guess you can just spend it all on me

I'm a young white rapper and I dont get high
Teenage girls is what I really like
And I'm still a young boy but I'm still so fly

Yeah, you see my smile caught it on the cam-er-a
Drink a Red Bull grew wings see the stamina
Shout out to my boys, yeah, they're up there in Canada
I used to live there 'til I moved to Atlanta
Where the girls are so hot, here the girls are fine too
Catching Bieber fever, forget the swine flu

Can I be the one to take you round town?
Be the one to call when you're feeling so down?
I could be your man
You could be my crown
I'm J. Bieber, first name last name!
J. Bieber, check it on the past lane!
J. Bieber, im always in the fast lane!
Yeah uh

[Intro]
Usher, baby
I hear you, yeah
Rock with me
Fuck with me

[Verse 1: Usher]
Hey girl, I'm debating if I should take you home
Should I take you home?
I don't mean to keep you waiting
But I just gotta know if you're ready

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
She say she wanna take her skirt off, be my guest
I decided to take my shirt off and show my chest
And we've been sipping on that Merlot
So you know what's next
Working intermissions, switching positions
We so explicit, oh...

[Chorus: Usher]
You've been saying all night long
That you couldn't wait to get me home alone
What you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see
Girl, I can't wait to get you home
Talk a good game, mate, come on
Hollering 'bout what you gon' do to me
Quit talking 'bout it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see

[Verse 2: Usher]
I'll be anticipating
What you would do to me
What you gon' do to me?
Sex education
Hands on when you're with me
Can you handle me?

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
She say she wanna take her skirt off, be my guest
I decided to take my shirt off and show my chest
And we've been sipping on that Merlot
So you know what's next
Working intermissions, switching positions
We so explicit, oh...

[Chorus: Usher]
You've been saying all night long
That you couldn't wait to get me home alone
What you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see
Girl, I can't wait to get you home
Talk a good game, mate, come on
Hollering 'bout what you gon' do to me
Quit talking 'bout it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Got on all my ice, talking cash shit
Been balling all my life, Lamborghini's, fast whips
She down to ride and deserves a boss who down to provide
We run the streets, but on G5's, I'm talking fly
Boots and blue jeans, Cartier, newer rings
You with a big boy, so we do the big things
Had to valet park it, Chanel hoodie on
Looking like Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman, I'm wanted
She on my wanted poster, Ciroc in my mimosa
I'm balling like LeBron, we shopping in Milan
The 458 Ferrari, I park it on the lawn
I let her meet my tongue, she blew up like a bomb
The sex is so explosive, her stuff is supersonic
She my new addiction, I swear, I'm through with chronic
Rozay and Usher Raymond, girl, we the hottest
Rocking the most ice, I said we the hottest

[Chorus: Usher]
You've been saying all night long
That you couldn't wait to get me home alone
What you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see
I can't wait to get you home
Talk a good game, mate, come on
Hollering 'bout what you gon' do to me
Quit talking 'bout it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see

[Intro]
Your mind may refuse to believe
Your mind may refuse to believe

[Verse 1]
I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don't eat meat
And drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock it’s almost an art
You need SPF 45 just to stay alive

[Chorus]
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like...

[Verse 2]
You're so sad, maybe you should buy a happy meal
You’re so skinny, you should really Super Size the deal
Secretly you're so amused that nobody understands you
I'm so mean 'cause I cannot get you out of your head
I'm so angry 'cause you’d rather MySpace instead
I can't believe I fell in love with someone that wears more makeup
And

[Chorus]
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You're so gay, and you don't even like boys

[Verse 1]
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Verse 2]
I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Verse 3]
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Verse 4]
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Verse 1]
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

[Pre-Hook: B.o.B]
Let em hate

They gonna have to call a nigga MJ, MJ
I've been ballin on these niggas all day, all day

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I'm hotter than a sauna
Hotter than the summer
Throwin shit down, call me California
Kush is my cologne yeah you know the aroma
I make the whole club open like a soda
I got hella haters, haters on my boner
Cuz I'm ballin on these niggas quota after quota
Nowadays everybody got something to say
Like a fuckin interviewer on the phoner
Where the girls with a good head on your shoulder
When I'm on campus show me your diploma
Good brains, good student
Go crazy, go stupid
It's me east side bachelor
Kicked back kush'ed out to the maximum
Fly like traveler, high like a passenger
On purp, on lavender
So I laugh as I pass you up
When you running down the sideline
Niggas on the bench trying to grab at ya

[Hook: B.o.B]
Let em hate
Cuz I'm straight
I've been ballin on these niggas all day, all day
They gonna have to call a nigga MJ, MJ

And you don't even know what I'm about
You know, you know, you know it won't stop

[Verse 2: Nelly]
You talking about money than you calling my name
You talking about flipping money than you talking my game
You talk about gettin money than we talking the same
You talk about small money than you talking it lame
I'm with that so mellow, whole other level
I'm gunna tell her to get in the trunk, heavy metal
5.0 yeah bag is little
Guess whose back
Uh huh no riddle
Two bad bitches
Guess whose in the middle
315 yeah guess whose eating biddles?
Used to eat kibbles, but the dis won't get it
If it don't come fully equipped then don't get it
The seats ain't leather my man then don't sit it
If you ain't got no rubbers on hand then don't hit it
Here what I tell ya man? don't play with it, nope nope don't play with it
I collect money like child support
I gotta get it cus I gotta pay child support
Cus my baby momma think I'm at the slot machine
I like soccer moms I'm on the soccer team
From the block to the board room
We can do it in the streets or in the court room
I put a hoop in the house that's a court room
Now a nigga shootin jumpers from the fourth room

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Drinks on us, freaks on dick, haters on hush
All eyes on us everything you see the Suvs pull up
Down like that whenever we creep up
And we slide to the back and we stay linked up
Why the hell they hating on us
I'm living my dream don't wake me up
Ballin so long It's boring
Ballin so long I'm yawning
Haulin so long that I gotta let the flow cool off cus my feet just
Scorching
Anybody trying to get up on my level better have to feel misfortune
And you ain't never seen this brooke
You like "can anybody tell me where the door is?"
I will never ever ever have a shortage
18 damn months been touring
And I don't ever see my house, my couch, or my bedroom set seems foreign
But I always knew there'd be bitterness
These niggas speak fluent gibberish
Life can be ridiculous
So I ball like this on these hypocrites

[Hook]
I’m tripping out
I’m tripping out
We met in a crowded place
Expression on her face
The look in her eyes says she wanted me
So I played it cool
But inside I knew
If I made my move
Then hand it for, she’s seconds away

Me and you touching, dancing the night away
I’m not the one, i’m not the type
Feelings of passion taking my breath away
I wanna love you girl
Only you control my mind

Tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love, your love
I’m tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love
Got me thinking ’bout your love your love
Time was standing still
A destiny fulfilled
Just watching her body movement all night long
Then she took my hand, instantly we danced
She knew by my angst that I wanted more

Me and you touching, dancing the night away
I’m not the one, i’m not the type
Feelings of passion taking my breath away
I wanna love you girl
Only you control my mind

Tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love, your love
I’m tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love
Got me thinking ’bout your love your love
Oh babe

Got me hallucinating
Anticipating
Imagining me and you
(in love, in love, in love)
Does that make me crazy or infatuated
For imaging me and you?
(in love, in love, in love)
Got me hallucinating
Anticipating
Imagining me and you
(in love, in love, in love)
Does that make me crazy or infatuated
For imaging me and you?
(in love, in love, in love)
Me & you, me & you, me & you

I think about you girl
Tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love, your love

Tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love, your love

[Spoken: DeRay]
What in the fuck was that, Kanye?! I told you to do some shit for the kids! You can give me your muthafuckin' graduation ticket right now! You give me this muthafuckin' robe before you catch some senioritis! You will not walk across that stage! You won’t slide across that stage! Motherfucker can’t pull you across that stage, Kanye! Who told you? See, I told you to do something uplifting! I’m tryna get you out here with these white people and this how you're gonna do me! You know what, you's a nigga. And I don’t mean that in no nice way. Had little kids sing about the shit—the joke's on you. You throw your motherfucking hands in the air and wave goodbye to every-motherfucking-body! 'Cause you getting the fuck out of this campus! What the fuck you gon' do now?

[Verse: John Legend]
I'm no longer confused, but don't tell anybody
I'm about to break the rules, but don't tell anybody
I got something better than school, so don't tell anybody
My momma would kill me, so don't tell anybody
She wants me to get a good ass job, just like everybody
She ain't walked in my shoes, I'm just not everybody

[Intro]
A long, long time ago
In a galaxy far away
Naboo was under an attack
And I thought me and Qui-Gon Jinn
Could talk the Federation into
Maybe cutting them a little slack
But their response, it didn't thrill us
They locked the doors and tried to kill us
We escaped from that gas
Then met Jar Jar and Boss Nass
We took a bongo from the scene
And we went to Theed to see the Queen
We all wound up on Tatooine
That's where we found this boy...

[Chorus]
Oh my, my, this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin', "Soon, I'm gonna be a Jedi"
"Soon, I'm gonna be a Jedi"

[Verse 1]
Did you know this junkyard slave
Isn't even old enough to shave?
But he can use the Force, they say
Ah, do you see him hitting on the queen
Though he's just nine and she's fourteen?
Yeah, he's probably gonna marry her someday
Well, I know he built C-3PO
And I've heard how fast his pod can go
And we were broke, it's true
So we made a wager or two
He was a prepubescent flyin' ace
And the minute Jabba started off that race
Well, I knew who would win first place
Oh yes, it was our boy

[Chorus]
We started singin' "My, my, this here Anakin guy"
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin', "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
"Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi""

[Verse 2]
Now we finally got to Coruscant
The Jedi Council we knew would want
To see how good the boy could be
So we took him there and we told the tale
How his midichlorians were off the scale
And he might fulfill that prophecy
Oh, the Council was impressed, of course
Could he bring balance to the Force?
They interviewed the kid
Oh, training they forbid
Because Yoda sensed in him much fear
And Qui-Gon said "Now listen here
Just stick it in your pointy ear
I still will teach this boy"

[Chorus]
He was singin' "My, my, this here Anakin guy"
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin', "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
"Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"

[Bridge]
We caught a ride back to Naboo
Cause Queen Amidala wanted to
I frankly would've liked to stay
We all fought in that epic war
And it wasn't long at all before
Little hotshot flew his plane and saved the day
And in the end, some Gungans died
Some ships blew up and some pilots fried
A lot of folks were croakin'
The battle droids were broken
And the Jedi I admire most
Met up with Darth Maul and now he's toast
Well, I'm still here and he's a ghost
I guess I'll train this boy

[Chorus]
And I was singin' "My, my, this here Anakin guy"
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin', "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
"Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"

[Outro]
We were singin' "My, my, this here Anakin guy"
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
Sayin', "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"

[Hook]
My nigga, I’m a beast!
I can go thirty days and nights with no sleep
Like the mice in the streets
The only meal that I see every day is my cheese
I don’t think you can keep up
Keep up, hey, keep up, hey!
I don’t think you can keep up
Keep up, hey, keep up, hey!
I don’t think you can keep up!

[Verse 1]
Cause when I’m riding in your lane, getting it poppin simple and plain
Konvict model, no pain no gain
Everybody blowing up like they done drank propane
I slide through the hood, the game unchanged
My niggas on the corner still selling cocaine
Now I ain’t even tripping you should do the same thing
Til I got the opportunity to make some more change
I’m watching all these haters getting close to my fame
Only if they know what it takes to maintain
If you live by the bar then we raised it
I was built to do this thing daily

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Used to hang out on the curb
Now I’m living lavish in the 'burbs
Women used to never pay attention when I flirt
Now they see me out in public, steady ripping up my shirt
It’s funny how the tables turn and out there
No longer sitting in the coupe handing out birds
Collecting all this money from different parts of the world
Flown up out of this loop, gotta see me first
Cause I sacrificed it all to be me
You ain’t got enough what it takes to beat me
Conditioned by the slums and raised by the streets
I've killed for this life it takes another soldier

[Hook]

Because in my field, only the strong will survive, yeah
And if you’re as hard as steel, then you and I will collide, yeah
We gon' rush at each other like two rams fighting in the grass land, yeah!
And i’ma be the last man standing!

[Hook]

My nigga I'm a beast (x3)

[Intro: Big Sean & (Meek Mill)]
God (Yeah)
Oh God, boi (Yeah)
G.O.O.D. (MMG, nigga)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill & Big Sean]
Chain all V.S. I ain't with the B.S
Catch me in your city riding hard through the B-X
Skinny nigga but I do it large like a 3X
The last nigga tried to do me wrong, umm, he checked
Right back to that money slinging O's in the p-jects (Yeah)
Or probably catchin' mileage while the pilot steer the P-Jet
(Woah) Cause we next and we flex like...

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
90PX (Woah), working all night no breaks or a recess
Vroom vroom yeah I know my car sound like a T-Rex
Bitch, I'm 23 years old and I ain't riding in a Prius (Swerve)
My cousin finished school can't believe he graduated (Boi)
Threw him 20,000 dollars told his ass congratulations (Ah)
Cause me? I wasn't made for that shit
But I could probably hire him and who all paid for his shit
And to all the hoes that was dissin' I pray to God that you see me
I'm on a yacht getting hella' high smoking good that seaweed
Bad bitch in her cha-cha grabbing on her chi-chi's
Million dollar deals on my email you mad as hell you ain't CC'ed
Chain all V.S., bitch, you know it's B.S
Boy, I run my city

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
End of story, nigga P.S.
All white Maybach, Green Bay they packing
Y'all niggas was slackin', 'member the hard nights we trappin'
And they say life's a game of chess
You can play checkers all on my jacket
Cause it's Damier and we bombs away on y'all bitch rappers
I say yeah, nigga, I murder that, Panamera turtle back
Niggas say they want beef, well, where the fuck is my burger at?
I got white, was serving that, I been to jail, I ain't going back
I alley-oop your bitch off that backboard, she throw it back
I slam dunk in that pussy, Blake Griffin'd your ho, nigga
Maybach with Ricky Ross my chain rock like I know Jigga
That's cause I do, ho, shout out to my new ho
That pussy pink like Nuvo and I dog that; Cujo

[Chorus: Big Sean & Meek Mill]
Niggas wanna talk, what they gon' say? (gon' say)
I hit the pedal til that motherfucker break (til it break)
Freaky bitches love the money I make
And to live like this you motherfuckers gotta pay
So let that shit burn! Let that shit burn
I'ma let that shit burn, let that shit burn (Burn, gasoline!)
The roof on fire, I'm only gettin' higher
50 racks all in my pocket, I want bottles, I'ma let that shit burn

[Verse 4: Big Sean & Meek Mill]
Bitch, I had one shot and I ain't blow it
Riding til the wheels fall off and they tow it
I got green on top of green damn it's looking like I grow it
D-Town the hood behind me like a king cobra
Burn bitch, I let it burn bitch
My money straighter than a motherfucking perm, bitch
No navigation you can see it is my turn shit (swerve, swerve)
Shorty give me all that brain still ain't never learned shit

[Verse 5: Big Sean]
Oh that's your girl? Damn nigga, you ain't learn shit
She naked in my studio I'm on that Howard Stern shit
I swear that mac 10 is my barbell, Finally Famous the cartel
Hit your girl in my whip and now that pussy got the new car smell
Same shit, different day, I ain't broke no more, it's a different day
Don't turn me down, I got shit to say
My purp strong like it's lifting weights
It's Sean Don sippin' Chandon
I got a bad bitch with them pom pom's
My Rollie don't tick-tock, your shit sound like a time bomb
Boom! Lil' bitch

[Chorus: Big Sean & Meek Mill]
Niggas wanna talk, what they gon' say? (gon' say)
I hit the pedal til that motherfucker break (til it break)
Freaky bitches love the money I make
And to live like this you motherfuckers gotta pay
So let that shit burn! Let that shit burn
I'ma let that shit burn let that shit burn (burn, gasoline)
The roof on fire, I'm only gettin' higher
50 racks all in my pocket, I want bottles, I'ma let that shit burn
Let that shit burn
I'ma let that shit burn, let that shit burn (burn, gasoline)
The roof on fire, I'm only gettin' higher
50 racks all in my pocket, I want bottles, I'ma let that shit burn

[Intro: Meek Mill & Drake]

Wealth and health
For my family

She wanna fuck and I say church (Preach)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Bottle after bottle, drink until I overdose
Pull up in the Phantom, watch them bitches catch the Holy Ghost
Errtime I step up in the dealer I be goin' broke
Shorty wanna fuck me, I say get on top and roller coast
And I lay back, she go cray, fuck me good, but she no stay
Murder on that pussy let her boyfriend get that DOA
Get it? And all I get is Frito Lay
Plus I'm on probation, when they test me I just pee Rosé
Cause last night, I went hard, Peach Ciroc, Patron and all
Thirty racks on magnum bottles, I think I was born to ball
Lookin' like a million plus, fresh I'm out that corner store
Hater I be doin' me, you guys should be doin' y'all
I'm stackin' money to the ceiling
All this ice that's in my Rollie I be chilling

So I could take care of them children, let's go

[Verse 2: Drake]
Just bought my niggas some caine, so much it came with a plane
Bought my niggas some dope, so much it came with a boat
I just bought me a crib so big it came with a moat
For niggas jumping the fence I hope you niggas can float
And I just hope that I'm forgiven for carin' 'bout how they livin'
And loanin a little money and keepin' 'em out of prison
I ain't lyin' in my verses I'm just telling you the basics
Of growin' up with your friends and becomin the one that made it
Yes lord! All gold, man I got these bitches soul
Talking bout these other rappers getting old is even getting old
Worrying about your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggas poppin' like our collars up
And good ain't good enough, and your hood ain't hood enough
Spent my whole life puttin on, you spend your whole life puttin up
Ain't no telling when I go, so there ain't shit that I'ma wait for
I'm the type to say a prayer, then go get what I just prayed for

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)

[Verse 3: Meek Mill and (Jeremih)]
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm just tryna win
And she a devil in a dress but if she knock I let her in
And if she knock I let her in
I have her wet by 12 o' clock, then 3 o' clock she wet again
I'm screaming Oh Lord, that pussy good, that pussy good
I'm tryna hold on, I wish I could, you think I should
She got that million dollar body, shorty my Bugatti
And she said she got a man, we keep it secret Illuminati
(Got Patron on deck) And Ciroc all in my bottle
(Push it all on her) She was on that Reposado
(She take it all off) And I think I'll rep Serato
In this bitch I'm spending like I hit the lotto, cause it's a lot of...

[Hook: Meek Mill]

[Verse 1]
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share

[Chorus]
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view

[Verse 2]
Ah, push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Ah, fallin' all over myself
To lick your heart and taste your health, 'cause

[Chorus]
With the birds (Share this lone—), I'll share this lonely view
With the birds (Share this lone—), I'll share this lonely view
With the birds (Share this lone—), I'll share this lonely view

[Verse 3]
Blood loss in a bathroom stall
A southern girl with a scarlet drawl
I wave good-bye to Ma and Pa
'Cause with the birds I'll share

[Chorus]
With the birds (Share this lonely), I'll share this lonely view
With the birds (Share this lonely), I'll share this lonely view

[Verse 4]
Soft-spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl and
Autumn's sweet, we call it fall
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl and

[Chorus]
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share

[Chorus]
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
Easily, let's get carried away
Easily, let's get married today

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Shao Lin shouted a rose from his throat
Everything must go
A licking stick is thicker when you break it to show
Everything must go

[Chorus 1]
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me, if you will, exactly what we're fighting for
Calling and calling for something in the air
Calling and calling, I know you must be there

[Verse 2]
Easily, let's get caught in a wave
Easily, we won't get caught in a cage

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Shao Lin shakin' for the sake of his soul
Everything must go
Lookin' mighty tired of all the things that you own
Everything must go

[Chorus 2]
I can't tell you who to idolize
You think it's almost over but it's only on the rise
Calling and calling for something in the air
Calling and calling, I know you must be there
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me, if you will, exactly what we're fighting for
Throw me to the wolves because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky because I know I'm coming back

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Shao Lin shakin' for the sake of his soul
Everything must go
Lookin' mighty tired of all the things that you own
Everything must go

[Chorus 3]
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me, if you will, exactly what we're fighting for
Calling and calling for something in the air
Calling and calling, I know you must be there
I don't want to be your little research monkey boy
The creature that I am is only going to destroy
Throw me to the wolves because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky because I know you're coming back

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Close to my skin, I'm falling in someone who's been
Sittin' by the phone, I'm left alone in another zone
John says to live above hell and my will is well
No one is waiting for me to fail and my will could sail, yeah

[Verse 2]
It's such a waste to be wasted in the first place
I want to taste the taste of being face-to-face with common grace
To meditate on the warmest dream
And when I walk alone, I listen to our secret theme

[Chorus]
Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you

[Verse 2]
Sailin' for the sun, 'cause there is one that knows where I'm from
I care for you, I really do, I really do
Come closer now so you can lie right by my side
I sit alone in the sun, I wrote a letter to you gettin' over myself, yeah

[Chorus]
Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you
Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that was made for you
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you

[Outro]
Close to my skin, someone who's been, I'm a-falling in
Disasters are just another star falling in my yard
John says to live above hell and my will is well
Long to be with someone to tell "I love your smell"

[Verse 1]
Dusting off your savior, well, you were always my favorite
Always my man, all in a hand
To celebrate you is greater now that I can
Always my man
Now you see what I came for, no one here is to blame for
Misunderstand, all in a hand
Just like you cause you made me all that I am
All in a hand

[Bridge 1]
A butterfly that flaps its wings affecting almost everything
The more I hear the orchestra, the more I have something to bring
And now I see you in a beautiful and different light
He's just a man and any damage done will be all right
(Call out my name) Call out my name (Call and I came)
(Call out my name) Call and I came (Call and I came)

[Verse 2]
Dusting off your savior, forgiving any behavior
He's just a man, all in a hand
Your hero's destined to waver, anyone can
Always my man
I would never betray you, look at me who could raise you
Face in the sand, safe in your hand
You were always my favorite, always my man
All in a hand

[Bridge 2]
We are the Red Hots and we're loving up the love-me-nots
The flowers in your flower pots are dancing on the table tops
And now I see you in a beautiful and different light
He's just a man and everything he does will be alright
(Call out my name) Call out my name (Call and I came)
(Call out my name) Call and I came (Call and I came)

[Outro]
Dusting off your savior, the life that you have narrated
You were my man

[Bridge + Hook - Akon]
This concrete’s too cold to be walking on it
Oh yes, walking on it with no shoes on
Don’t wanna struggle oh no
Don’t want it to become a habit
I'd be living in the gutter with no shoes on
Let me get up out of here before I
Hurt somebody, 'fore I have to hurt somebody
Before I
Hurt somebody, 'fore I have to hurt somebody
Before I
Hurt somebody, 'fore I have to hurt somebody
Before I
Hurt somebody, 'fore I have to hurt somebody

[Verse 1 - Akon]
My momma need a crib, son needs some Jordans
This is some bullshit, cause I can’t afford them
Feds listening, in the van recording
Trying to dodge the pen, hoping I survive the morning
Shit is getting hot, man I’m talking scorching
Watching bodies drop, trying to make a fortune
Dancing with no top, trying to stick my fork in
Wanna own the block then you gotta put your work in
Because

[Bridge + Hook - Akon]
This concrete’s too cold to be walking on it
Oh yes, walking on it with no shoes on
Don’t wanna struggle oh no
Don’t want it to become a habit
I'd be living in the gutter with no shoes on
Let me get up out of here before I
Hurt somebody, 'fore I have to hurt somebody
Before I
Hurt somebody, 'fore I have to hurt somebody
Before I
Hurt somebody, 'fore I have to hurt somebody
Before I
Hurt somebody, 'fore I have to hurt somebody

[Verse 2 - French Montana]
Brother need bail, stead calling
Dreaming out the cell, till he wakes up in the morning
Magic warp always disappears
Smoked got my eyes blurred
But my vision clear
Hothead, but this concrete cold
Titanium bitch I never fold
Never judge a nigga before you judge yourself
You ain’t got to help me
Nigga help yourself
They got their hand out
I don’t know what they told him
Well tell them I’m the mob
I don’t own them
I’ll take you to the sharks
They can't breathe out the water
I’ll tear your ass apart and put you out of order

[Bridge + Hook - Akon]
This concrete’s too cold to be walking on it
Oh yes, walking on it with no shoes on
Don’t wanna struggle oh no
Don’t want it to become a habit
I'd be living in the gutter with no shoes on

Hurt somebody, 'fore I have to hurt somebody

Yeah
Pump, pump, whew!
Pump, pump, pump, pump, right
Air, check it, uh

Lyrical champion, the lyrical champion (Go!)
Lyrical champion, we say the mindset's a threat (Go!)
Lyrical champion, the lyrical champion (Go!)
Lyrical champion, we say the mindset's a threat, uh

[Hook]
You know!
You know the mindset's a threat

Go! Go!
Check it

In the industry, you see, they keep a yellow tape
Got the microphone because we want to be free
Never oppress, nor to relay your stress
May lack ability, but now you're put to the test (Go!)
I run a set in the cool atmosphere
Don't worry about my dumb kicks or the car that I steer
That material pressure is just a digressor
Be livin' my life, for they have not yet bothered with pressure, uh

[Hook x4]

Drop it!

Ease up!
Bringin' in the new lifestyle in 1991 now
With the raggamuffin style we're bringin' it deep, yo
Now bring it down
Aw, shit

Listen to what I'm sayin'
Materialism I'm slayin'
Chasin' a prediction, know what I mean
It's the system your obeyin'
Throwin' it like a catcher
You say what you think, you dancer
Runnin' the free nation
Money's not free, if you thinkin' you want the answer
GO!

I run a set in the cool atmosphere
Don't worry about my dumb kicks or the car that I steer
That material pressure is just a digressor
Be livin' my life, for they have not yet bothered with pressure, uh

(You know!)
Yes!
(You know!)
In the new sound!
(You know!)
Ease up!
Greed!
Causing innocent blood to flow
Entire culture, lost in the overthrow
They came to seize and take whatever they please
Then all they gave back was death and disease
My people were left with no choice but to decide
To conform to a system, responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide

AIDS is killing the entire African nation
And a vaccine is still supposedly under preparation
But these governments, they don't mind their procrastination
They say, "We'll kill them off, take their land and go there for vacation."

My people's culture was strong
It was pure and if not for that white greed
It would've endured
My people were left with no choice but to decide
To conform to a system
Their minds enslaved, their souls encaged
I feel the rage
It's brutality can never be undone
But the sun is not yet set
The bass and drums and microphones a threat
That's when ya investigate the crimes from the inside
And see that they're responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide
Responsible for genocide
Ya cram ya culture down my throat
Say I'm inferior when I find it I choke
Ya fill my mind with a false sense of history
And then you wonder why I have no identity?
Well I'll strike a match and it'll catch and
Spread the insight we need
A tiny fire, burning bright
Shedding light on the darkness of greed

A yes yes y'all
And ya don't stop
Shedding light on the darkness of greed

A yes yes y'all
And ya don't stop
Shedding light on the darkness of greed

Yeah!
Hey yo, let me be front, this is real and not a stunt
I'm comin' to the forefront
Shovel for the rebel and clear the lane
Cause this jam is like a tomahawk, chump

Teach ya, I'll never stop droppin' topics
Vocal power, yes I got it
On central but their trying to clamp it down
Flag was waving the wrong way so I shot it, down!

Get down at the same time come up, down!
This is the crime that shut us up
I don't give a fuck because the words and the thoughts still hit
And like I said, it's not a skit

Jump another hit, yeah
Ya know I don't need a drum kit
Make 'em say, "Aw shit"
The rebellion is true and legit

[Hook]
Down!
Get down! And clear the lane
Down!
Get down! And clear the lane
Down!
Get down! And clear the lane
Down!
Get down! Yeah!
The rebel, you'll never disable
Defiance, with the cards up on the table
Pulling cards, keep the governments in check
Yo! I think we need a new deck

Never could trust a phillabusta'
The mic is like a fist and it'll bust ya
With words cold hittin' with the underground
And now you're checkin' out the new sound

Live hit, a live pop
Live rock and ya don't stop
It goes on and on and on
Who's a threat? C'mon, the war is on!

[Hook]

Start droppin', our words are never safe
Fighting myself 'til I'm where I gotta be
A challenge, don't sweat it, now don't you forget it
Check me? What? Wait, you better slow down

Realize I can't confine my rhyme to a beat
I need cash so pinnacle is never ever weak
Places are fluid and diluted and complete
Check me once, calm down, take a seat
Strip the chains the freedom's there but then it's gone!

Uh, clear the lane
Uh, clear the lane
Uh, clear the lane
Uh, clear the lane

Defiance, rippin' up the sound set
Every time I'm grippin' the mic it is a sound threat
Resist against the suckers that bring the bass in
Timmy C, bring that bass in

Uh, clear the lane
Uh, clear the lane
Uh, clear the lane
Uh, clear the lane

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, Kendrick Lamar, tone what up,check it out
As the day go I let the beat rock
Then put my thoughts inside the cradle, hip hops
God Father plant the seed, you should be my son
And if you niggas hot, I guess I am the sun
I'm a degree away from global warming, this a warning
Shot like I knew Big but I'm enormous
I hear an Instrumental then I turn to Norman
So go tell ‘em I killed it you fucking informant
I’m always performing
Like it’s my last morning
Before I sit with the Lord and see my mother mourning
I’m in the air with it like a new pair of Jordans
Ground level never been important when I walk the earth
Walk to church bishop said he lost his Bible this time
Told me that he need a verse, I blessed him with a couple of lines
Bear hugged a few bears, wrestle with a couple of lions
That’s the imagery I delivery when I fuck a rhyme…
Fuck off, Kendrick Lamar

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]

Jay Rock motherfuckers you know what comes after that
My town I rep it till im off this map
Watts City, Eastside baby
Chillin in the bricks with bricks looking for fifty
It’s still in my blood, nigga it’s all natural
Welcome to L.A gangbang Capital, Still rocking my colours I wasn't sworn in it
I ain't a millennium baby,look I was born in it
Bless the beat when I speak everytime, cocaine bars that tweakin off every line
I’m in deep space now when I write, no pen no pad in my mind when I write
Flow bolder than a cold on a polar bear, shhh im the one that this rap niggas fear
You can’t do me, this game’s like an ocean catch a nigga floating on the top like a boat…Rock!

[Verse 3: Microphone Tone]
Lil Watts lil Compton in the dash of the East
Kendrick Lamar, Rock, and Tone put you back in your seat
A natural beat
Got me like a savage and beast
The rap game start to look like an immaculate feast
I'm back in this piece
So listen when the package complete
Join the cause or hit the hills when disaster released
The passion in me
Got me spittin' accurately
So the realest MC is what I happen to be
You can vibe wit it or move back
These new jacks gettin blue black
With boom bap I proved that
Know my Golden State affiliates can prove that
On my menace shit Long Beach Venice shit
Primitive the way I crafted this all the penmanship
It's intricate now go and start the sirens
My microphone's on the flow is sparking violence
We the best duo out since Bo and Marcus Allen

[Verse 1]
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
(And I need to go on and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Verse 2]
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
(And I need to go on and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Outro]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end, oh
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions...
Drop it
Hey, uh

Try to crack and somehow react
Vocal snaps attract
I'm trying to rap
Those who try to subdue the truth
Lose their condition
Were labelled inactive

Being 91
The twentieth century
Brooklyn is a magnum in a bottle of kerosine
Flame ignites into the black sending fright
Tortured and weak minds
And words and insight

Back to the explosion on the stage
Guns fear
Presence of war creates a dangerous atmosphere
Using my brain a certain power is obtained
Using the strength I've gained
A struggle remains, but I
Choose another tune to uplift
Yeah, you know my anger is a gift
A gift to expect the test we all must face
Hah, out my face

Release the reason
Allow the pain
The actors change
But the play's the same

[Hook]
C'mon
In the narrows
In the narrows
In the narrows

Some are the holders of power
But will start a galactic shower
Turn to my brother, little power, structure itself
Hate only motivates and creates more hate

State to state
I set it straight and investigate
Dull fate
While teachers taught me lessons
At the oppression I react with aggression
Yo, my section after section
No need for repressing
Just take the mic and a rap another session

No need for guessing
Yeah
And that shit that you're stressin'

Release the reason
Align the pain
The actors change
But the play's the same

Release the reason
Align the pain
The actors change
But the play's the same

[Hook]

Ugh!

UGH!

Divine are stepping up and proving to suckas
They cannot dumben up their style
And I do it with a smile
When I put punks on trial, taking 'em back again
Yeah
The name of the comprehender

The style I drop is going on and on
To the punks who recognize the style
And realize that I'm not no Punk Kid
Just stepping up for the mic hit

[Hook]

Ugh!

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
From the West but I'm heading to the Northside
That's the top, I need a crib on the shoreside
I need a backyard full court size
From where the judge is the only thing that's courtside
Chasing money in the city of crime
Cashback so then it's black bags under my eyes
Man fuck it I got a dream worth more than my sleep
To me playing in the game is worth more than the seats
Man fuck these hating ass bitches I'm gone
They told me no then I reverse it I'm on, I'm on!
I'm on, I'm on, they told me no then I reverse it I'm on
Mama had two jobs I know that she was working for me
Ten years later, hired to working for me
Hired the whole family like mobsters
Getting paid off our operation we ain't even doctors
Grandma called, see me on the Billboards around the city
Man going around around the world so many times I'm dizzy
London or Japan, Orlando, Walt Disney
Paris, Abu-Dhabi, California weed twistin' man!
Texas to Toronto where they love that nigga Drizzy
All the way to Detroit, the whole city fucking with me
Heading to the money, whole city coming with me
And I'mma rep the city 'til the reaper come and get me yup!

[Chorus 1: Big Sean]
And this is how life should go
Everything I wanted never seem so close
Good people, good drinks, good smoke
Got me thinking this is how life should go
This is how life should go
Everything I wanted never seem so close
Family all around, all highs no lows
Got me thinking this is how life should go

[Verse 2: Wale]
Sitting back, putting all my issues in a swisher
I keep it funky with my Mrs, fuck these other bitches
And this ain’t biblical but this sermon is spiritual
‘Cause when it come to winning, convincing is only been a few
The upper percentile
Whipping whatever I, 460LS you
I probably go less miles, stay in a small circle
Know that it’s God working
Police got the swine flu and these niggas is reptiles
Yeah, Maybach poetic genius
You buying a seven jeans, keep mine in a 7 Bimmer
I’m trampolining on niggas and I actually mean it
A fly nigga, I keep having a gravity grievance
And while these niggas keep hating, they be asking for features
That’s like a complacent atheist is asking for Jesus
Riding around without a fuck given
Behind them dirty plates like a catcher with a mitten
The best in my position, I’m passionate with lyrics
And they ain’t fucking with the kid like Chris Hansen in the kitchen
I’m handsome to these women, I’m envied by these no ones
That’s no Joakim Noah, nigga everybody know us
And even if you don’t drink everybody po’ up
‘Cause all these hating niggas probably never gon’ show up
Never hate on no one, your blessing’s getting closer
Even when I’m open, it's nothing to Ed Cota wassup

[Chorus 1: Big Sean]
And this is how life should go
Everything I wanted never seem so close
Good people, good drinks, good smoke
Got me thinking this is how life should go
This is how life should go
Everything I wanted never seem so close
Family all around, all highs no lows
Got me thinking this is how life should go

Part II: "All I Know" ft. Wiz Khalifa

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Could you tell me where to go? I need direction
Where are we now? Where's the intersection?
Motherfuck my phone, it never has reception
In this cold world, it's all about collection
So I, I stack paper and keep it ghetto
Oh, cause when you rich you are on top of the world
I made a promise to the mirror
That I'd, never ever ever go broke
Riding through the city, I be riding through the city
All I know is bad bitches, I got Finally Famous with me though
Plenty smoke, plenty rolled

[Chorus 2: Big Sean]
So I'mma drink and smoke and fuck and go go go
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
All I know, all I know -ow -ow
-ow -ow -ow
All I know, all I know -ow -ow
-ow -ow -ow
All I know, all I know -ow -ow

All I know, all I know -ow -ow

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Well, I’m flyin' over, literally, flyin' over cities
Got my carry-on but really wish I had a pound with me though
My watch is thirty thousand dollars, Dolce and Gabbana
I done spent so much in Prada, I don't wanna know
I'm the reason that your bitch is smoking weed now
No blunts, lil' bro wan' roll up joints
Seen the how-to video now he on point
And he tryna make it front row to the show to throw me one
If I ever hand you some weed, it's free, you don't owe me none
Just put on one of me or Big Sean's CDs and roll me some
And there's only one, you know you know
Khalifa guy, I stay high like Pluto

[Verse 5: Big Sean]
Okay, I'm going hard (I'm going hard), I'm going dumb (I'm going dumb)
I'm going in (I'm going in), 'til I'm going numb ('til I'm going numb)
I got a lot to say, I don't hold my tongue
I just hold money, don't hold me up
Rolling in more green than a hole in one
You got more than me? Then shit roll somethin'
See I be off of that tree, people tell me I shouldn't be
But early on, my mom taught me that everything green is good for me
I wake up to three girls, my role model is Hugh Hef
I gave ya girl a t-shirt since she gave the whole crew neck
I don't dance, I two-step, my weed loud, it suplex
I came up from that basement, man straight up out of that duplex
Bitch, if I ain't a G, I'm an OG
Two fingers on my joint, one to the police

[Chorus 2: Big Sean]
So I'mma drink and smoke and fuck and go go go
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
All I know, all I know -ow -ow
-ow -ow -ow

[Akon: Hook]

Dont know about you my nigga but the street's been good to me

Dont know nuttin else but the street life when it come to me
I never thought I'd ever think about bitin' the hand that fed me

[Obie Trice]
Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks
I came in the game profane, no image
I came in the game widda name I was given
From a mane
Who ain't give a fuck about his chitlin'
I proclaim the name though
Never in vain, no!
Watch the change grow
A young nigga who done gained from fame
Copped a range rov'
Now they want my brains on the main road
But they don't understand what I came fo'
I came forth, with a million sold
Who say you can't grow from mildew and mold?
Get money like Ross Perot
I'm often told, "A coffins the routes I go."
Oh, thats the road you on, oh no!
Im down for the rightful tone of .44
Don't never try to send a nigga home, no! no!
I know you wanna catch me at Sunoco
Show me that ya loco
Put holes in my photo
NOPE!
Ope
Hold toast no jokes since thugs beat the polo'

[Akon]
Stayin' here I'm just gettin much older
S'time to go stack up enough cheese
Hot Glocks just gettin' much colder, dodgin' and duckin' the police
How much longer must I stand on this corner?
I Gotta get off right away
How much longer must me see sell on this corner before they take my life away?

Dont know about you my nigga
But the street's been good to me
Even took a whole lotta bullshit but it made me a stronger G
(fades)

[Verse 1]
I wanna leave my footprints on the sands of time
Know there was something that meant something that I left behind
When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget

[Chorus]
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here

[Verse 2]
I wanna say I lived each day until I die
And know that I meant something in somebody's life
The hearts I have touched will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see

[Chorus]
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I’ve done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I will leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here

[Bridge]
I just want them to know
That I gave my all, did my best
Brought someone some happiness
Left this world a little better just because
I was here

[Chorus]
I was here
I lived, I loved
I was here
I did, I've done everything that I wanted
And it was more than I thought it would be
I wanna leave my mark so everyone will know
I was here
I lived (I lived), I loved
I was here
I did (I did), I've done
I was here
I lived (I lived)
I loved (I loved)
I was here
I did, I've done
I was here
Running everywhere trying to find who I am
Going nowhere so I'm trying again
I am so lost like paper no pen
Yes you have call so, yes, here I am
Cold no sweater
Bold no letter
So much better
My role go-getter
My tole is red then the fire in my eyes
I'mma rain no weather
The goal I'mma set is a whole lot better
When the storm from Jehovah comes
I'm gonna be the best ever
Love from the start
Peace in my heart
I'mma roll ah were never be apart
But I still wonder
Have I felt the thunder?
I can feel it in my heart shooting like a like a hunter
Yeah, a straight gunner, but it feels strange
Yeah the things in my heart, makes things change
How I felt before makes my brain rearrange
And what I do it for is definitely not the same
Can I just take a minute?
Yeah, just wait a minute
Starting to hate the minute
We have to pay the minute
Yah alright ok the minute
Or we could wait a minute
See how many times it just takes to say a minute
Life is so short, but we just take it for granted
Hand over my life and it was a life I was handed
Flying so high and, yes, I just landed
Im tryna figure out what my plan is
His hand is on my life, and my sin just vanished
My filth washes of quick like her fake tan is
I'm growing up quick like a grown man is
I'mma be set so will my great grand kids
Swag!!!!!

[Intro: DJ Drama & Meek Mill]
Maybach Music!
They say your brain's most creative in your sleep
See, they say, in the sleep state
The brain thinks much more visually and intuitively
Ha, what is this? (Maybach Music)
I like this Maybach Music! Swate!
As dreamchasers, we accomplish that wide awake
Turn everything up a lil bit in the headphones!
You ready? (All-Star!)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Ready or not, here I come
You can't hide, nigga I'm too damn fly
Sippin' all of this purple, it got me too damn high
They say they're down for the team but playin' two damn sides
I'm like niggas ain't loyal (no!), niggas ain't loyal (no!)
And these voices in my head saying niggas ain't for you (nah!)
And when you gettin money these niggas will aim for you (fire!)
And when its looking sunny these niggas will rain on you
It's a dark cloud over me, money took control of me
I'm barely getting time to see my son and that shit hurting me
Baby momma trippin out, I tell her to work with me
I'm on probation still strapped, 'cause niggas want to murder me
And lately I've been getting faded (faded)
Cut a couple homies off cause them niggas hating (they hating)
And all these bitches wanna fuck me
'Cause a nigga made it (I made it!)
I'm getting paper heart cold as the refrigerator

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Young nigga getting money
Young nigga getting money
Young nigga go and get it yeah
And ain't a damn thing change but the bezel on my Rollie
And the diamonds in my chain, yeah

[Interlude: DJ Drama]
As dreamchasers, we consider ourselves a creative upper class
When it comes to ideas, we're just in a different tax bracket
Gangsta Grillz, you bastards! (Gangsta!)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Young rich nigga quarter millie worth of jewels (jewels)
Bad bitch with me trying blow me like a fuse (fuse)
Just to get a bag or maybe a pair of shoes (shoes)
Ain’t it crazy what your lady would do for a pair of Loubs, huh?
Big dreams turn to big things (things)
I’ve been waiting on this day since I was 16 (16)
Big chains, Aston Martin as I switch lanes (skrrt!)
Before I ever made a hit, I had a wrist game
In the kitchen with them thangs, trying make a killing (killing)
We in the building, every other month I make a million (yeah!)
Any nigga talking reckless cause they think I’m chilling
'Til I put some money on their head, yeah, make 'em feel it
Have they own homies do him like they never knew him (fire!)
I'll have Omelly walk up on him when we run into him (fire!)
Close range shorty have him put something through him
So I hope you're ready cause we heavy and we're coming for you

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Young nigga getting money
Young nigga getting money
Young nigga go and get it yeah
And ain't a damn thing change but the bezel on my Rollie
And the diamonds in my chain, yeah

[Interlude: DJ Drama]
Dreamchasers 2
We decided to share the wealth again
Care to join us?

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
The meek shall inherit the earth
So I’ma own this bitch until I’m buried in dirt
I only roll with niggas that'll carry me to my hearse
Blesses for my grandma, she carried me to that church
And I don’t know why, I just feel like I’m the one (one)
They label me a victim but now look what I become ('come)
Or should I say became, I don’t do it for the fame
I’m from where they never make it but I went against the grain
Charges riding against my name, assasination to my character
Life’s a bitch, she cheated on me but I married her
Niggas getting murdered, this shit is getting scarier
Dodging all the potholes, jumping all the barriers
And if she a bitch, I feel like I just got in that pussy (yeah)
Shorty wanna be a star, that’s why she popping that pussy
She trying to win, so she hang amongst winners
That’s why I take the time just to pray at mom’s dinner (I pray)
Cause I remember, cold nights not the winter (not the winter)
Not the weather, I’m talk about within us (within us)
Cause for that money, sins they get committed
And friends, they get to splittin', divided just like division
So every day that I wake up, my undivided attention
It goes to getting my cake up and staying out of them prisons
Yeah! The system made me stronger
And being broke just gave me my hunger, I'm gone!

[Outro: Meek Mill]
Nigga like me?
I walk around, fear no man (no man!)
I don't owe you niggas shit! (shit!)
E'ry nigga you see around me
That's the niggas that's with me (my niggas)
Unless they in jail or dead or something
Nigga livin' life like, "Fuck all you niggas"
You feel me?

[Sample: Mike Tyson interview]
I’m the best ever. I’m the most brutal and most vicious and most ruthless champion there’s ever been. There’s no-one can stop me. I’m Alexander, he’s no Alexander. I’m the best ever. There’s never been anybody as ruthless. I’m Sonny Liston. I’m Jack Dempsey. There’s no one like me — I’m from their cloth. There’s no one that can match me. My style is impetuous. My defense is impregnable, and I’m just ferocious. I want your heart. I want to eat his children. Praise be to Allah!

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah!
Gangsta Gri-zillz!

[Verse: Meek Mill]
It's a lot of bad bitches in the building, amen (Amen)
Came in the game killing niggas, J-Lin
When it comes to whips, I'm on some shit
I'm probably eight in (Woo!)
And I got that four-door Aston Martin on the way in
Y'all niggas come out (Come out), all the hoes stay in (Stay in)
Every time I come out (Come out), movie in the making (Yeah!)
Realest nigga in it all you got to do is say it
If a nigga rap dissing, when I see him I'mma spray him
Like bang, nigga it ain't no game (Game)
Philly niggas ain't the same, step in your lane (Lane!)
Before that chopper hit your brain stay out the frame (Frame!)
Cause when I let it bada-boom, that's bada-bang
Pussy nigga, ahhhh! Right back like I never left
Rollie on my wrist cost a Camaro, yeah, the double-S (Hater!)
Ever since I made a milli, I ain't been in trouble yet
Still walk in the building and go bonkers with a hundred racks
Hundred stacks, hell yeah, hell yeah, fucking right
Boy, I got your favorite singer really tryna fuck tonight (Ha!)
Y'all niggas was sleeping on me, I was really up at night
Tryna chase my dream, now I ball out the team
Man, I lean off of this Phantom (Skrt!)
"I'ma Boss" my anthem (yeah)
MMG my clique, that's why your bitch all on my dick
I got thirty racks in my pocket, I keep thirty shots in my clip
I get thirty racks for my verses, y'all don't get paper like this
I'm getting money, must be Illuminati
They think I signed up
'Cause I just bought a new Ferrari (New Ferrari)
And when I make a hundred I'mma buy a new Bugatti
I be with some Philly niggas, they just trying to shoot somebody
Tell 'em (Tell 'em!), I swear I tried to tell 'em (Tell 'em)
Lampin' in this penthouse, I started from the cellar (Cellar)
And if she want that hammer all up in her I'mma nail her
Word to my nigga, Ricky, we gon kill the game this summer
Ahh!

[Chorus](x2)
Shawty's got the sweetest lips
The fliest hips that caught my eyes
Girl, I understand if you don’t want a man
But I gotta get in there

[Bridge]
You got it, got it, got it
You’re so sweet, can I try your honeycomb?
Want it, want it, want it
Impatient, can I get the keys to your home, home, home, home?

[Chorus]
Shawty's got the sweetest lips
The fliest hips that caught my eyes
Then I understand if you don’t want a man
But I gotta get in there

[Intro: Meek Mill & DJ Drama]
See, I'm an A1 type of guy (Uh-oh!)

Rock A1 clothes (true)
Drive A1 whips (true)
And still pour A1 sauce on my shit
I come from the bottom (Poppin the bottles!)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Crushing all these hoes, rocking all this ice
Selling all these O's, nigga, I done did that twice
So I'm just riding round in my Rolls, about to get on my bike
Just to touchdown in my hood and I put that on my life
I'm like yeah nigga, I'm there nigga, I ball hard all year, nigga
My diamonds all clear nigga, smack my chain you dead nigga
I don't know what you heard, and I don't know what you thought
But all my dogs they murk, and all my dogs go hard, fuck that
My new young chick look exactly like Rihanna
Ass like Nicki, but she yellow like Madonna
I take her to the mall, buy her all types of designers
YSL, fly Chanel, all that Dolce & Gabbana
I jump right back like 36, lean hard when I turn the whip
If I ain't have my rap deal, then I still be serving bricks
So I kill a pussy, I murder shit, homicide on shorty
My gold Role cost 60 racks, my rose gold cost 40

[Hook: Meek Mill & DJ Drama]
I get A1 money, I'm an A1 nigga
Got a A1 swagger, I'm getting A1 bitches

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Pray to God, I wash my hand but I be damned

Don't read the contract 'less a mill in there

I got a bus full of bitches, I call it Jay-rome Bettis
I grab my dick in the picture, your ho be cropping the image
I let you scrape off the dishes, we eating nigga, I'll finish
Then come right back, hope you insomniac
Sleep on me if you wanna take a dirt nap
Bitch I'm talking ca-ca-ca-ca then more ca-ca-ca-ca
Hit your roof until I pop your top up
Then more ca-ca-ca-ca, til I know I gotcha
Ballin like I'm baldin', then I see Jordan in the mirror
Nigga, that's flawless VVS, and CC text me, "What you wearing?"
Puttin my all inside your bitch, I grip her hips, that's power steering
About to hydroplane when I board that plane
And land inside the building

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I get A1 money, I'm an A1 nigga
Got a A1 swagger, I'm getting A1 bitches

[Refrain: Meek Mill]
Ciroc all on my table, bitches in the living room

Bottles poppin' models watching all in my living room
Welcome to my house party party

[Verse 2: Fabolous]

You little niggas do whatever make you feel bigger
Every time I'm around yall, something's a little fishy
I smell, I smell, I smell pussy!
What's your name, where you from? Almost done with interview
I'm into having intercourse, is that something that interests you?
Yes, no, maybe so, baby bro fix me up
Real house party shit now hold up your Dixie cup
With your other hand, do me a fucking favor
Put your middle finger up and say "Fuck the neighbors!"
And Fuck the haters they never invited
They can't get on my level, my level is private
Who fly more than me? My level is pilot
My pockets stay fat, I'm never on diet
Don't be stuntin' out of town when you get on
I do you like Kid and whoop your ass when you get home

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party

Haters love to talk you down when bitches always speak you up

[Verse 4: Mac Miller]
You only getting one shot, I hope your picture takes
Bitch I'm spitting on this remix like I'm Kid and Play
You know I'm getting laid like I'm Vincent Chase
I'm thinking 'Ye should hit me up just say that shit is cray
Off the backboard playa, I enjoy to bank
Plus my people smoking on that pack, noise complaint
I murder beats and get away, it's First 48
But this the house of love homie, word to Courtney's place
20 racks a night, that's on merchandise
I'm rollin' up this killer, sippin' purple Sprite
Party hard then head to Europe on a early flight
Walking 'cross the London Bridge, that's that Fergie life
White boy, gone wild
Every time I do a show it's like the Pope in town
And I call my girl Titanic, cause she go down
Hope she don't drown, bitch

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party

Fuck her on the lean, then I fucking doze off!
The dope man is my role model, I had a TV on top of my floor model
That bitch would show, fiends used to smoke dope out the antenna
Closet full of amphibians, aim at it and hit it
Difference between me and your girl: my girl, ass thicker
Life sentence in my trunk, real niggas respect it
Dumb charm on my necklace, stupid watch on my left wrist
I ain't have a lot so I brag a lot, when I got a lot, I pop a lot
I bought a drop, bought some pussy, get head in the parking lot
My rhyme style's unorthodox, my weed stank no Tic-Tac
Asking me where I get that, Gucci sat on my flip flap!
Paint job cost 10 stacks, rims cost me another ten
So tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend

[Refrain: Louis V]
We just too turnt up
Turn up to the max
We be gettin' to it
Do it straight like that
We just too turnt up
Turn up to the max
We be gettin' to it
Do it straight like that

[Chorus: Louie V]
We do it straight like that
Get money straight like that
We run it straight like that
Who want it straight like that?
We do it straight like that

Who want it straight like that?

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Straight like that nigga, straight like that
No birthday get cake like that
And I ball hard niggas hate like that
Cause I drop that work, come straight right back like whoa
I peeled off in the Bent, came straight right back in a Rolls
Peeled off with ya bitch, came straight right back with ya ho
Nigga we share that bitch, 10 big chains I don't wear that shit
Big Glock 9, I air that shit
And a big V12, I steer that shit like skurrrt
And they be like word, I'm with a bad bitch, but I wouldn't wife her
My neck all froze and my wrist like burr
And my shit so cold, Ima need a light fur
We turned up to the max, turned up on them racks
Got shorty all on that pole and she gon turn up for these stacks
Cause I'm ballin', like Spalding
My wrist flooded, New Orleans
And I'm shittin on 'em, no toilet
And no referee, I called it

[Refrain: Louis V]
We just too turnt up
Turn up to the max
We be gettin' to it
Do it straight like that
We just too turnt up
Turn up to the max
We be gettin' to it
Do it straight like that

[Chorus: Louie V]
We do it straight like that
Get money straight like that
We run it straight like that
Who want it straight like that?
We do it straight like that
Get money straight like that
We run it straight like that
Who want it straight like that?

[Chorus]
Girl I know you got a man, and you so in love with him
But can I get a dance? Maybe a little loving
Slim girl, if I took you home, I wonder, I wonder
Maybe I was wondering
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
Cause I need you tonight
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
Cause I need you tonight
(Tell your man you'll see him next week, cause we gone)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I say Maserati stance, get it we disappearing
I tell her cut off the phones, there's nothing to interfere
She follow my every order do anything that I dare
I'm giving her everything so all my neighbors can hear it
Scream to her making her fiend more
We be making a movie they thinking its Scream 4
Got that from bruh Jeezy and then I put Dean on
I'm 7 looking like Heaven, I love when them jeans on
We rolling get your chick stolen
Stand up paper I can't even fold it
Old bread baby, my money be moldy
Every time I'm going down it's nothing but roses, yeah
I was just on the money, never was on hoes
I told shorty play her part like some corn rows
And maybe you could get a Neiman Marcus wardrobe
I'm talking tearing down the mall when the stores close

[Chorus]
Girl I know you got a man, and you so in love with him
But can I get a dance? Maybe a little loving
Slim girl, if I took you home, I wonder, I wonder
Maybe I was wondering
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
Cause I need you tonight
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
Cause I need you tonight
(Tell your man you'll see him next week, cause we gone)

[Verse 2: Wale]
Dub A.L.E. you know I'm in the house
I'm going on whatever shorty point them bitches out
They love me up top, I'm important in the South
I could talk them into drinking and then talk them out of a blouse
Look, wild youngin, brown drinking and loud loving
Living in a moment shawty it's now or never
I'm in a 911, this shit is rented though
But how I'm whippin' this muthafucka you never know
Shout out my brother Meek, O Melly what it do?
We trying to find how many bitches could fit in the coupe
She addicted to bags, I'm addicted to shoes
You could buy em for me, he can buy em for you
Word. Wale Folarin
Young'un Supreme SB's, I'm a star in this muthafucka
Raw in this muthafucka, Vuitton a nigga's duffle
John Doe flow: got a car in this muthafucka
Woop! Park the Caddy in the living room
He ain't talking about no paper we don't listen to him
I try to love 'em in the physical not literal
After I'mma hit it gotta give a little nigga room!
A little space! I gotta breathe
We blew enough trees, you gotta leaf!
No days off, me and Meek
Young gunner, Rock Boys, double MG!

[Chorus]
Girl I know you got a man, and you so in love with him
But can I get a dance? Maybe a little loving
Slim girl, if I took you home, I wonder, I wonder
Maybe I was wondering
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
Cause I need you tonight
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
Cause I need you tonight
(Tell your man you'll see him next week, cause we gone)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Man I like my drinks high, my lights low
And I'm stacking paper like trifolds
'Til my momma neighbors them white folks
'Til my account triple O, oh, triple o, oh
Man the bank teller thought it was a typo
I've got loose girls in tight clothes
Man, that dance floor look perfect
Only thing it's missing is Michael
Twerk that shit, berserk that shit
Finally Famous ho, I deserve that shit
Put syrup on top, I dessert that shit
Then afterwards I'm gone, I desert that shit
B.I.G. lil bitch!

[Chorus]
Girl I know you got a man, and you so in love with him
But can I get a dance? Maybe a little loving
Slim girl, if I took you home, I wonder, I wonder
Maybe I was wondering
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
Cause I need you tonight
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
Cause I need you tonight
(Tell your man you'll see him next week, cause we gone)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Hate is my motivator, wrists on refrigerator
Money participator, got power like generators
Look what my wrist done made us, wholesale like liquidators
Shout out my imitators, fuck how I am a flamer
I'm all of that, fuck them hoes, don't call 'em back
You on it but we off of that
Get paper, just like office max
Shittin' on these niggas, where the fuck they put my toilet at?
Obama on my wrist, presidential bitch
In the back of the 'bach, smokin' some presidential shit
And I'm strapped with the mack, on some residential shit
And if your homie think he tough, I get him presidential hit
I got 20 in the stash, for a nigga ass
Take 

[?] to the front when I hear he didn't cause 

[?]
Let me cut my lawn, snakes up in the grass
Nigga I'm a king and you a pawn so do the math
They be throwing shots, they ain't hit me yet
Talking they gon kill me, they ain't did it yet
I say when my shooters shoot it, it bet in the neck
So if you want to gamble with your life then it's a bet
Yes, cause I be all up on it, I'm dawning
Up early in the morning, make money while you yawning
If she want to fuck me tell that ho make an appointment
Cause I spend all my time up on that grind, that ain't important
Bout my dollar sign, take em back to school and I'm the Columbine
Went to jail, came back, went to jail, came back again
City in the chicken wing, just like Bobby 

[?]
Catch me in the Cadillac, me and Charlie, Mac, and them
Chasing down the Benjamins, we catch em we gon tackle them
I came from the hood, went to Hollywood
Jumped up out the Bent' on the red carpet like what's good
Meet my nigga Jigga, fresh from out the mud
Fresh from out the set I'm screaming free my nigga Bud
Rest In Peace to Dolla, homie you a coward
Shot at my nigga Dream, I bang on you, Dwight Howard
If I ever get a chance, standing in my stance
That's why I'm shooting first, hater will fuck up your whole plans
Take me back to jail, sit me in a cell before a coffin full of nails
Fuck her then I'm well
I'm from Philadelphia niggas will crack your bell
They try to hit you first, you hit them though they tell
But I came to get it jumping like a kangaroo
What else I came to do (shit on the whole industry)

[Intro: Jordanne]
Yeah (oh-oh)
Yeah
Yeah

[Chorus: Jordanne & Meek Mill]
I used to be a used-to (Used-to, used-to, used-to)
I used to be a used-to (I used to be a used-to)
I used to grind in the dirt
I used to cry to 'til it hurt (Oh-ho-ho)
I will look up to the heavens
When is my time gonna come?
I used to be a used-to
But I never got used to
Being what I used to be (Yeah, yeah)
Said I used to be a used-to (Yeah)
But I never got use to (Never)
Being what I use to (Yeah) be (Uh!)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I was never used to niggas that was used to...
Being broke so I started selling coke (Coke, coke)
Times got hard, was selling soap
Scheming just like the preacher in church; he selling hope (Hope)
Now I'm getting older, heart getting colder
Looking at my son while his head lay on my shoulder
Thinking in my head, "Will I make it to see him grow up?
Or will I catch a bullet from something these niggas throwing?"
Trying to take me out, in the hood trying to make it out (Out)
Niggas plotting on me cops all staking out
Trying to get a couple bricks so I can make a house
Close friends hating on me, really tryna play me out
Damn, but niggas couldn't deal with me
If they had blackjack, my shooters would still hit them
North side of Philly where it's real gritty
And dirty at, where everyday they murder at

[Chorus: Jordanne]
I used to be a used-to (Used-to, used-to, used-to)
I used to be a used-to (I used to be a used-to)
I used to grind in the dirt
I used to cry to 'til it hurt (Oh-ho-ho)
I will look up to the heavens
When is my time gonna come?
I used to be a used-to
But I never got used to
Being what I used to be (Yeah, yeah)
Said I used to be a used-to (Hey)
But I never got use to
Being what I use to (Yeah) be

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yeah, when I was young, I started planning it out
My daddy got killed; I was the man of the house
By the age of 16, man, them hammers was out
So when niggas trying to hit me, I'm just handing them out
Cause I ain't trying to see my mom crying (Crying)
And my sis mourning (Mourning)
So I'ma let this little Mac 11 rip on them
Louboutin sneaks, watch the blood drip on them
For all the times I bled, the tears I shed
Every time I made money, it was here, I said
And if my niggas asked for it, it was "Yeah," I said
Selling butter just to get the fam bread, I spread
I got married to the streets and it was here I wed
'Cause I was never used to being what I used to
Started off walking now the Rolls Royce a coup too
I'ma let the top down every time I shoot through
To give them motivation, even though I know they hating

[Chorus: Jordanne]
I used to be a used-to (Used-to, used-to, used-to)
I used to be a used-to (I used to be a used-to)
I used to grind in the dirt
I used to cry to 'til it hurt (Oh-ho-ho)
I will look up to the heavens
When is my time gonna come?
I used to be a used-to
But I never got used to
Being what I used to be (Yeah, yeah)
Said I used to be a used-to
But I never got use to
Being what I use to (Yeah) be

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
The man with the gold makes the rules
And one who makes the rules break the rules
Some niggas make it alive, some make the news
It's either family or money; I hate to choose
'Cause you need money just to feed the fam
The family keep you cool
Got a nigga on the papers; still, I keep the tool
Niggas heard I'm getting money so they creeping through
I keep my hand up on that hammer what's for me to do?
Let these niggas kill me? (Yeah)
Try to line me up so they can rail me?  (Yeah)
I'm just giving you the real me
Started with a dollar now I got it and I'm filthy
Nigga!

[Chorus: Jordanne]
I used to be a used-to (Used-to, used-to, used-to)
I used to be a used-to (I used to be a used-to)
I used to grind in the dirt
I used to cry to 'til it hurt (Oh-ho-ho)
I will look up to the heavens
When is my time gonna come?
I used to be a used-to
But I never got used to
Being what I used to be (Yeah, yeah)
Said I used to be a used-to (Hey)
But I never got use to
Being what I use to (Yeah) be

[Verse 1: Flynt Flossy]
Ch-ch-check the blogs, what you gon' see?
Everybody talk about Flynt Flossy
Is he real? He can't rap
Take that back, I rip all tracks
And some blogs be talking smack
Been chill too long, time to react
(Y'all got fans?) Yes, we do
And sold-out shows so screw you too
Floss got fame now, he's sexy
Damn, these girls be all on me
Open those legs bon appetit
Gimme those toes when you lick them feet
Like doggy food, I'm pedigree
So hating blogs get off of me
Don't care 'bout what you gotta say
And no, I'm not Charlie Murphy!

[Verse 2: Yung Humma]
I hang with the Jeep, bang with the Jeep
Got lady fans that really wanna smang with a Jeep, y'all
Think it's a date, won't creep, wanna peep
Tryna dig up dirt, yeah the jeeps gon' sleep
Too difficult to figure out so little bloggers simmer down
Or you just might lose it
Have a seat, shut your mouth, turn us up
Take the thinking cap off, and enjoy the music
Where I'm from? Does it make a difference?
If I said to look away, would you turn around
And take me off the hit-list?
I don't think so
Are you mad right now? Yeah, I know
Go home, put your thumb in your mouth
And lay in a position that’s fetal
No time for babies
All the credit to the fans who ladies
Start writing this trash in your blog
Play around, acting like you hate me
Yung Humma

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Yeah
I'm a Mac Pro with an afro
And you guys blow like the Satchmo
And my cash flow out the asshole
And my last show was the Camp Tour
Saw your blog on Thursday
You only re-blog shit girls say
You didn't re-tweet my birthday
All your comments say "first" or "so gay"
Okay, we the fanboys
Sex fantasies with Androids
But I fuckin' mean what I'm writing
If I see you, nigga, we fightin'
On that shit, take a whiff
Move in silence like a .gif
If you try to hack my phone, you'll see pics when you ain't home
Man, royalty to the maximum
Got racks, and we stackin' 'em
I like beef when it's actual
I love how niggas talk that shit when you know you ain't catching 'em
Man, racist on your page, you should be on Key & Peele
Is that really how you feel?
Nigga, the internet isn't real!
Yeah, I saw a lady get fucked in the ass by a goat
Laugh for an hour, that's all she wrote
Would I laugh if I saw that shit in real life?
Yes (yeah)
Fuck your blog with a broomstick
I could fuck your girl with a Q-Tip
If I see you, nigga, let's do shit
Gambino boy, you stupid

[Intro: 2Pac Sample]
I'mma buy a Benz
Cause that's what niggas do
You understand me?
I'mma smoke weed
Cause that's what niggas do
I'mma pack a gat
Cause that's what niggas do
You understand me?
I'mma get drunk
Cause that's what niggas do
You understand me?
I'm not gon' change
Just cause a motherfucker's got money

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
They wanna lock me up
And throw away the key
I wanna pop 'em up
And throw away the heat
I don't play
And when I do, I play for keeps
I'm from the jungle
Where the lion eat the sheep
Yeah, Bubba just come home
From the penitentiary
When I see him
I'mma put him in a Bentley
Young Carter
What it is, what it isn't
Deep water
My sign say 'Gone fishing'
I'm a wizard
Poof, my top missing
Let the sky in
And tell the bitch kiss it
I sip Big Mo
I drank Pimp C
Never put the cup down
(Never put the cup down)
Bitch I'm from Uptown
I said Uptown
Well life's a nasty bitch
Ass bust down
Ask what now
And the answer never differs
Little Weezy
Is that nigga

Racked up shawty, racked up shawty
All these bitches call me "racked up shawty"
Racked up shawty, racked up shawty
And all these bitches call me "racked up shawty"

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Racks all on my wrist, racks all on my neck
I spend racks all on my bitch, look at these racks all on my check
Nigga, I'm racked up and I'm racked out, fuck a bitch 'til she tap out
Fuck a bitch then I pass out, and my pockets on J. Stackhouse
'Cause I ball hard, I'm swagged out, all black Maybachs out
Y'all niggas just speak shit and I live shit that I rap 'bout
'Cause these racks came from my crackhouse, dirty money like Diddy
Hammers niggas ain't ever seen, got 30 off in that 50
Now tell them hoes that I'm busy, tell them hoes that I'm ballin'
I done fucking ain't answered once now why does ho keep callin'?
Y'all niggas be fraudin', acting like y'all got it
That shit you call your stash nigga that's racks off of my pocket

And all these bitches call me "racked up shawty"

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
My shoes cost me a rack (nice), my outfit off the rack (nice)
My presidential Rollie, I'm calling that Barack (shit)
Damn I meant Barrack (shit), too much Ciroc (shit)
Won't catch me in that passenger, and that's word to Pac (damn)
That's word to B.I.G. (damn), rest in peace to the legends (yeah)
We kill niggas for acting, rest in peace to them legends (yeah)
Catch me in that Aston, I'm "wassup?" Fuck asking
They talk behind my bitch's back, they must've seen her ass then
From H town like the Astros, scorecard her ass 10
Pop pills no Aspirin, like a ski slope in Aspen
It's going down, going down, no I brought my ski racks
Niggas know my flow cold so I don't ride I ski tracks

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Racked up shawty, racked up shawty
All these bitches call me "racked up shawty"
Racked up shawty, racked up shawty
And all these bitches call me "racked up shawty"

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Racked up I'm racked out, black Ferrari blacked out
Black Friday black mac, popping spades blackjack
Bitch I'm hotter than fish grease, made 250 this week
Baddest bitch, all in her, balling bitch SportsCenter
Ass fat can't sit straight, ballin' like Griff Blake
Chain blue and white Penn State, touring off a mixtape
Racked up shawty, chain 'bout 40
Came in with one bitch, left out with four
Shout my homie Meek Mill, shout my homie Fabo'

Racked up shawty, racked up shawty
All these bitches call me "racked up shawty"
Racked up shawty, racked up shawty

[Intro: DJ Drama]
You ever watch a dream manifest? (You ever watch a dream manifest? ...)
Real life
It's nothing like it (It's nothing like it, It's nothing like it, It's nothing like it)
DC2

[Verse 1]
If you ain’t got a dream, you ain’t got nothing
A lot of niggas changed on me when I got money
Said it came with the game, and this what I wanted
So I’ma hustle like the first time I got fronted
For the love of the green and the love of the team
Put together a circle that couldn’t come in between
Went from lint in my pockets to using money machines
I got my city back popping and they don’t want me to leave
No they don’t want me to leave
But I gotta go and get it though
Time is money and I’m on a mission though
Papi gotta eat, niggas shooting right around my mama way
Cops run in my sister crib, I swear I gotta find a way
Tryna touch a million dollars and I’m like a dime away
Never ask a nigga for a handout, I would grind away
Write my little raps, smoke my little weed
Sold a little crack just to fund my little needs
I was sixteen getting on my little knees
Asking the lord please help me get a little cheese
It was hard out (Hard out), same time it was yard out
In the jungle where niggas will rip your heart out
Cold summers where niggas’ll probably starve out
Wanna be a kingpin from watching niggas ball out
Could you blame us, they was tryna chain us
But we was tryna fix the roof leak when it was raining
We was tryna keep the house warm when winter came in
But they rather detain us, locked us in cells with strangers to raise us
Animals go in cages
That’s what the slave masters told the workers when they slaved us (They slaved us...)

[Chorus]
Small city (Small city), big dreams (Big dreams)
I been waiting on this day since I was sixteen (Sixteen, sixteen)
Since I was sixteen (Sixteen)
I been waiting on this day since I was sixteen (Sixteen)

Small city (Small city), big dreams (Big dreams)
I been waiting on this day since I was sixteen (Sixteen, sixteen)
Since I was sixteen (Sixteen)
I been waiting on this day since I was sixteen

[Verse 2]
R.O.C. man told us “Sun don’t shine”
You know if his daddy hustling then his son gon’ grind
His father was locked up, now his son doing time
When certain niggas get to starving, know that gun gon’ shine
Two felonies on his record, he got one more time
Get an app, picture that, he don’t want no job
Lost hope, some niggas don’t even want no God
They just want a little money just to come through fly
‘Cause nobody never listens to the broke nigga
‘Cause when you broke, you considered as a joke nigga
If you a joke, you considered as a ho nigga
And no nigga wanna live life living poor nigga

Small city (Small city), big dreams (Big dreams)
I been waiting for this day since I was sixteen
Selling white girl, I’m talking Christine
Young boy with dreams of touching that big screen (Big screen)

[Chorus]
Small city (Small city), big dreams (Big dreams)
I been waiting on this day since I was sixteen (Sixteen, sixteen)
Since I was sixteen (Sixteen)
I been waiting on this day since I was sixteen (Sixteen)

Small city (Small city), big dreams (Big dreams)
I been waiting on this day since I was sixteen (Sixteen, sixteen)
Since I was sixteen (Sixteen)
I been waiting on this day since I was sixteen

Bitch get up off me

Bitch get up off me
Pussy get from round me

[Verse 1: Wooh Da Kid]

Nigga get up off me, Bitch get up off me
Sprinkle diamonds everywhere, everything frosty
40 niggas, 40 guns. (what) 40 Glock 40's (pow)
Gave that boy a closed casket when they shot shorty
Because we fucked one time that don't make you mine
I guess she think that I'm her man cuz I was in her spine
When you fucked my lil homies everything was fine
Well you ain't the only one, baby fall in line
If you ain't in my circle get from round me
They call me Wooh Da King I think you should crown me
You walk around and hold her hand but she wants me
But when im finished im like "BITCH GET UP OFF ME!"

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]

Bitch get up off me, Trick get up off me
Yo girl see my ride I can keep this bitch from talking
Stalking, talking, Bitch get up off me, trick get up off me
Hoes won't let me sleep, ball so hard its exhausting
Prick get up off me, trick get up off me, my top back on south beach
My car cost half a million dollars mothafuckin car chief
Im screamin "Get Em Flocka!" they like "Gucci get em off me!"
Pull up with the Buttercream guts painted coffee
Haters lookin salty, Nigga get up off me
Haters thought they had me but ain't no one to play me
Boy play with ya daddy, stacks all in my khakis

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]

Dope Man Nikes man this rap shit is easy
C4 leave ya leakin, he just another swag thief
Label tried to clone me but ain't no way to clone me
I robbed so many people that my family disowned me
Move in with my homies then I move back on my lonely
Swear my life a movie dawg I should win a Tony
Oscar Or a Emmy, Cuz Gucci Mane a Movie
No Wilt Chamberlain these bitches love my music. Its Gucci!

[Hook]

[B.o.B]
The world is a battlefield, the fight is a fireplace
We train to sustain, so how much pain can you tolerate
The goal is to dominate competition annihilate
We hunger for victory, it’s a dish that we gotta taste
It’s a good life we chasing, my shoes on I laced them
We don’t get complacent cause each step is greatness
A champion we made it, it’s my road, I’ve paved it
If you feel like I feel, you must feel amazing

[Hook:]
You wanna be one, with no one your side
How much longer till we make it now?
We’re all champions, we’re all champions
There’s no giving up, the hunger inside
One day we gonna make it, just …
You’re a champion, you gotta know
We’re all champions, whoa
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We’re all champions, we’re all champions
We’re all champions
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We’re all champions, we’re all champions

[B.o.B]
It’s all that I’ve ever know, it’s all that I’ve ever seen
I came here with nothing but I’m a leave with a legacy
A brand new and better me, believe is the recipe
And ain’t no second guessing when you thinking successfully
Taking no for an answer isn’t part of the deal
You see the blood, sweat and tears, we leave it all on the field
We make our dreams reality, you can tell that it’s real
Cause I’m a champion, I live the life I said I would live

[Hook:]

[O.A.R]
Whoa, who’s gonna tell me that it’s not my time?
Who’s gonna tell me that the world ain’t mine?
All of us rise up when the time align
Looking for nothing cause it’s all inside
Running away the of midnight run
Fire, fire, I’m a champion
Higher, higher, it’s my chance
We’re all champions, we’re all champions
We’re all champions, whoa
We’re all champions, we’re all champions
We’re all champions
We’re all champions, we’re all champions

…there’s no more life to break this
Hope is all we got …the stress, the doubt time…
Taste the…be strong, …

[Intro]
Yea that's right you better walk away
Go on and walk away cause I'mma burn this motherfucker down
King Kong ain't got shit on me

[Verse]
Running them ghetto streets, I ain't cooking up nothing
But I got the tea kettle on side of me, that metal on side of me
I dare you to follow me, I'm double daring you to follow me where the drama be
His momma in debt, so she can't pay the funeral fee
So wherever them candles at, that's where the funeral be
Kids don't get sleep, guns keep 'em up real late
Walk in the school, shells laying on the concrete
Take 'em to school, show and tell, for that final grade
She gave him a 'F', I say that young boy deserve a 'A'
Cause she never slept where he slept, or seen ricochet bullets rip
Through his cousin's face, ripping his face off
I aim the fifth straight, concentrate like I'm playing golf
I'm Tiger Woods with a gun in my car, I keep one in my car
And keep a bitch with implants, so she keep one in her bra, boom
Shit, make room for the lil bastard
The flyest nigga you seen on centennial campus
The eight ball tucked in my jeans while I'm getting patted down
They didn't know I had it on me, stupid security
No one securing you, if I'm gon' touch you
If I don't like you, the Mossberg pump love you
I take that back, it probably just wanna go and fuck you
Go with you, then dump you inside the coneal confortable
Defending my belt, depending on nobody but myself
Unless you talking 'bout money, I need yo help
I need some help, they say that my screws is loose
Like handlebars on mongoose, this is true
You tough rappers, I'm talking to you
He ain't on no used to shit, but you see his face grew
He say that he fabulous, but really don't have a clue
That he just a puppy living in this zoo
Shit, whoo, with that said, you should know I am the truth
The truth hurts, you should feel pain when I'm done with this verse
I'm done.... psyche, I ain't finished
Ever since the first grade, been bad with the run-on sentence
I never sat the benches in the game of life
I played the whole forty-eight minutes, Christ
I rap with precision and lyrics, is grandma nice
I'm cooking up something, you want you a slice? Then get it
I'm holding my stomach, I'm shitting, I'm farting
On any rapper thinking I'm in his vision, is you retarded?
The CL got my head spinning awkward
Bought it last month, 'bout to put it up for auction
I'm not rapping, I'm talking powerful
And for that dirty money, boy, the Mac'll shower you
The Mac disintegrate, and then devour you
The mag'll forget you, regurgitate and sour you
I world trade you niggas, north and south tower you
Steroid, my authority overpower you, the industry ain't affording me
They might as well just give me my money and start ignoring me
Cause y'all niggas boring me, y'all ain't making no dollars plus no cents
I swear, y'all niggas foreign to me, foreigners
I tell you what, go and tell it to the coroner
Killing 'em whenever my performance come
When I do it, it won't be nothing right after I'm done
When I ruin niggas' careers, put you niggas in tears
Get you pom poms, you better off, cheer for me
Shit, the new money is here for me

[Verse: Meek Mill]
I just call my homie and he say he got a lick
He said he know a pussy nigga with a hundred bricks
So we gon' ride up on em, slide up on em with them sticks
Finna pop up at his crib like a fuckin' magic trick
Hocus-Pocus, to the safe like you ace nigga open focus
But this ain't Calvin niggas, ridin' like a locomotive
Where the cash at? Show me where your stash at
Before I let the 40 air ya out and leave that ass flat
Pussy ass niggas man it's tax season
Make a move and this muthafuckin mac squeezin'
Act decent, bet them hollows leave your back leakin'
Niggas searchin' for the coca like we crack feignin'
I gotta hundred killas on my team
Young niggas gettin' greasier than Vaseline
Had a dream, I'mma chase it with this Mac machine
Put a nigga on the cover of a magazine
Home invasion, news paper got a man down
Hold this nigga legs, I'mma tie his hands down
Let em taste it, just to know that we ain't playin' round
He ain't gotta get up on your knees, nigga head down
Blocka! You fuckin' with a shotta
I'm bangin' 2Pac, my "Ambitionz Az A Ridah"
I got the oo-wop. tryna' get it for my momma
And we gon flush everything if them boys get behind us
'Cause we ain't comin' home, I'm in another zone
Ridin' with my dogs, we just want another bone
I got another lick, so I got another chrome
I ain't gettin' to the money, nigga, then there's something wrong

[Verse 1]
She bending it over
While she looking back at me

Baddest in the party
Scale of one to ten
And that ain't no exaggeration

[Hook]

But it feels so right, fits so tight; I be in it til the mo'
(What?!) Cell phone on the charger
We gon let it ring
I ain't never had a chick make me forget
Where I need to be
(C'mon!) Such a performer
The way I gotta sing it~
I know I gotta go, but it don't look like I'm leaving

[Bridge]
Girl, how you doing it.. To the beat (Yeah!)

[Know it's on, lil mama]
Oh-oh-oh-ohh-ohh

[Verse 3-Ace Hood]
Cause, yeah--Damn, shawty know she dead wrong
Way that dress fitting you would think it was painted on
Wine fine, dime. Hoping that you came alone
Even if you didn't, tell that lame nigga go on
Sayonara; Coupe is painted aqua
Body such a movie, girl, you deserve an Oscar
Kick it with the fliest nigga, dinnertime--lobster
Pussy good, swear I might consider me a sponsor
And that could truly be the liquor talking
(Oh!)
Words slurring like I'm fresh up out the dentist office
Yeah, and it ain't hard to tell "I'm On One"~
Pitch to me, guarantee I hit a homerun
From the Phantom to the counter to my bedspring
(Oh!)
Know it's on when I'm alone, let the phone rang
Damn, that body; Far beyond a hottie
Brought my nigga Kels, ain't no cuffing at the party but um..

[Hook]
Damn, that body. Damn, that waist (Woo!)
Damn, that dress. Damn, that face

All up in the crib, all up in the bed like-
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh. Oh-oh-oh-ohh-ohh

[Piano Intro]

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
‘Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, "Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!"
Trippin', yeah I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, "Yeah, I'm good at little league."
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And "God loves all his children" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
"Man, that's gay" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
"Gay" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it

[Trombone Interlude]

[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause: progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!

[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Outro: Mary Lambert]
Love is patient
Love is kind
Love is patient
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient
Love is kind

Hahaha, haha

[Verse 1]
Where the bar at? Tell me where the bar at
'Bout to buy the whole club, where my credit card at?
Money flyin' in the air, look at what I started
Asses clappin' up in here, damn, it's like an audience
And she bringin' all her friends, I'll be your sea-saw
She about to act a ass, hee haw
Got a stupid monkey, fatter then King Kong
It's like a pistol on you, take it all off, ha
You gon' need an ambulance
After you get done with this hammer in my pants
Make it stand up, watch it dance
All mouth, no hands

[Chorus]
I try to told you niggas, I'm the greatest
You bitch made, haters
Shoes crocodile, fuck 'gators
Ain't no need to talk, nigga, pay us
I'm 'bout to go, go, go loco
Go, go, my nigga just crazy (Bah!)
Go, go, I'm 'bout to go loco
Go, go, man, that nigga just crazy (Haha)

[Verse 2]
Look, oh, damn, my liver, damn, I got the shivers
My family got that bomb weed, but all I need is liquor
And then she got that butt, thicker than a Snickers
And shawty got that fire, so I popped her like a blister, ew
I know you think I'm losin' it, but why you speed ballin'?
Nigga, I am cruisin', bitch, nigga, we ballin'
And when I go to sleep, my tattoos come to life
Hoes in your head, out of mind, out of sight
That's why they call me Breezy, baby, cold as ice
Boy, don't you make me paint a portrait, rearrange your life
All my kicks fly, they Power Ranger Nikes
I'm the shit, nigga, ain't gotta say it twice
Tony the Tiger, call me Tony
'Cause everything's great when she twerkin' on me
Boy, I ain't no kin to ya, I am from Virginia
804, nigga, let go, man, they can't get rid of us

[Chorus]
I try to told you niggas, I'm the greatest (What?)
You bitch made, haters (Oh)
Shoes crocodile, fuck 'gators (Oh)
Ain't no need to talk, nigga, pay us (Pay me, nigga)
I'm 'bout to go, go, go loco (Haha)
Go, go, my nigga just crazy (What?)
Go, go, I'm 'bout to go loco (Haha, yeah)
Go, go, man, that nigga just crazy
She now wanna make love
When she whispered in my ear in the club
Want me to smack that, smack that
Pull her hair and give her good fuck
She say she want a real nigga
And I’ma give her just that what she said
And I’ma break her down till she can’t get it out of her head
She loves it when I throw dat, throw dat, throw dat dick
She loves it when I throw dat, throw dat, throw dat dick
She loves it when I throw dat, throw dat, throw dat dick
Throw dat dick, she loves it
She loves the way I put it down on her fine ass
Straight strong armed robbery black mask
The whole 9 and a half in your fat ass
I got the pussy soaking wet just that fast
Said she got it from her mama she a freak too
And she got a couple friends she could bring too
I’ma beat it up, like a bongo
And I’ve a feeling like she deep off in the Congo
See I’m world wide, with my dick game
Kuntakinte my nick name, ain’t shit changed
You know my pedigree, she got up in it like geodesy
I wanna make love, when she whisper in my ear in the club
She now wanna make love
When she whispered in my ear in the club
Want me to smack that, smack that
Pull her hair and give her good fuck
She say she want a real nigga
And I’ma give her just that what she said
And I’ma break her down till she can’t get it out of her head
She loves it when I throw dat, throw dat, throw dat dick
She loves it when I throw dat, throw dat, throw dat dick
She loves it when I throw dat, throw dat, throw dat dick
Throw dat dick, she loves it
She got a whole lot of ass and a lil waist
The reason bout to have me guilty on a murder case
She said I tried to kill her pussy first …8
I guess she looking like Rihanna, need a piece of cake
I rode a night I love it on the strip club
So many women to choose from, I’m mixed up
Magic city on Mondays, I’m all in
High next Tuesdays, I’m balling
Wednesdays I’m headed took them all
I love the girls and I’m tryna fuck them all
I’m a stroke current …
She now wanna make love
When she whispered in my ear in the club
Want me to smack that, smack that
Pull her hair and give her good fuck
She say she want a real nigga
And I’ma give her just that what she said
And I’ma break her down till she can’t get it out of her head
She loves it when I throw dat, throw dat, throw dat dick
She loves it when I throw dat, throw dat, throw dat dick
She loves it when I throw dat, throw dat, throw dat dick
Throw dat dick, she loves it

[Verse 1]
I said, I used to get high just to get by
Couldn't deal with my reality, was livin' in a lie
Sometimes I asked God, "Is we livin' just to die?"
Conversations with my dad, and he livin' in the sky
I think, "Am I goin' crazy? Or is this shit for real?"
The spirit of a nigga who will or is appealed
Fightin' to see the light and I'm fightin' to keep it real
Like a nigga with no lawyer, I'm ready to take a deal
Got me feelin' like Khaled 'cause all I do is win
I don't practice no religion 'cause all I do is sin
I don't even write it down, I'm just spittin' out what's in
I don't celebrate for victory, man, all I do is grin
Ugh, shit, I ain't braggin', I don't boast
But when it come to bread, fuck a slice, I need a loaf
And a little bit of toast just to keep the haters off me
Man, I do this for my city, all the niggas waitin' on me

[Chorus]
Look into my eyes, tell me what you see
Youngin' full of pride, tendencies of a G
I never gave a fuck what ya heard about me
Never told, never sold my soul, nigga this is me

[Verse 2]
I'm a family man
Don't you ever cross that line where my family stand
I send them boys to come and get you in that family van
Cold shooters that love them hammers like Yosemite Sam
I'm from a hood where these niggas scared to dream at
Fuck the money, they wanna know where the lean at
They make ya' lean back, I'm talkin' fade-away
Mike Jordan, gettin' it ain't important
How can I forfeit? Niggas makin' a fortune
Livin' in fortresses, gettin' it on some corporate shit
Go hard or go home and this the orphanage
Same niggas that I grew up I be often with
Small circle 'cause niggas a murk you
Most of the time it's niggas that know, but my niggas is purple...
Hearted, I seen the snakes before they even started
Caught 'em and the was dearly departed

[Chorus]
Look into my eyes, tell me what you see
Youngin' full of pride, tendencies of a G
I never gave a fuck what ya heard about me
Never told, never sold my soul, nigga this is me

[Verse 1]
When everybody leaves you lonely
Times are worse than sad
And the world is falling on your head
Just remember that for all you know
Good or bad, come what may
You're gonna live tomorrow if you don't die today

[Hook]
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love, yeah
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love

[Verse 2]
Now the fear got in me
It's got in me deep
That's where it's gonna stay and never leave
Someone come lay my worry
Someone come kill my pain
Someone come and put me on my feet again
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love, yeah
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love

[Verse 3]
We gotta love one another
That's what the good man say
But I got too much trouble going 'round my head
Someone come and pick up my love
Take it all away
'Cause I could break down tomorrow
If I don't die today

[Hook]
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love, yeah
It takes a muscle to fall in love
It takes a muscle to fall in love

[Outro]
Ay, ay, ay, ay

[Verse 1]
Hailing from parts unknown
Smoke and an Ice-O-Later
Spanish women in the crib they making rice for later
Wash the chicken in the sink then they pat it dry
Then they hit it with Adobo
My face is global
You're like a homo
My blood is pure I'm bred noble
Getting head up on a red sofa
Do a cartwheel in the Jag door
My shorts sag to the floor
Extra virgin olive oil up my ankle bone
Visit the bank with the chrome
Then have a banquet in a Rome
Five hours later in the tank top at home with my feet up
Abusing drugs
Using Susans
With two midgets naked for my amusement
You understand me?

[Hook]
As my drug rise quick, all my homies got a cup
Reliving all the days when no one even gave a fuck
Matching college sweatsuits hopping out the truck
Knee her in the stomach, drugs are dropping out her butt

[Verse 2]
Blow a few stacks on the capture
Even more for the statue
Portraits in Africa
My shirt protected by napkins
Catch me in Paris paper thin leather on a pleasant day
S'il vous plaît have my money
Ain't nothing funny
Legs crossed smoking Dunhills
We been to Brussels
Been to Holland
Rolling joints as thick as columns
Anything I want is fifty dollars
Twist ignition keys
You see me where the river be, floating
Big coat, toasting
White grapes in flute glasses
Hold a belt in two classes
I'm known to chief that green, Robert Parish
Shifting new coupes, lavish colored stewed cabbage
Young and ravishing galloping with the cavalry
Exotic parrots, you perish you’re like a parody
I’m in the galley of the ship cooking scrambled eggs up
On some Casey Ryback shit from "Under Siege"
Throwing darts like Byron Leftwich
Serve a fiend a continental breakfast out the building off the steps
Five series beamer wagon filled with Hess
Protect mine like eagles with the nest
I'm out for justice

[Hook]
As my smoke rise quick, all my homies got a cup
Reliving all the days when no one even gave a fuck
Matching college sweatsuits hopping out the truck
Knee her in the stomach, drugs are dropping out her butt

Put him out, he’s sleepin'
With all the sneakers on his chest, he barely breathin'
Like it’s lights out, he took a beatin'
Hand on his chest, holdin' his heart, pledge of allegiance

[Chorus]
Damn, his bitch cold, need a Theraflu
Took ‘em shoppin', bought ‘em 1500 pair of shoes
Ha, Theraflu
I'm a cold ass nigga, fuck you

[Hook 1: Akon]
Money to blow so I'm ridin 'round with that Nina (ride 'round with that Nina)
With a Hollywood ho with lips like Angelina (lips like Angelina)
My diamonds talk for me they say how can I meet ya? (how can I meet ya?)
G flyer then sky how high, oh I can see her (oh I can see her)
Got an island on my wrist, girl, I'm cashin' out (I'm cashin' out)
Got an island on my neck, girl, I'm cashin' out (I'm cashin' out)
My diamonds talk for me they say how can I meet ya?
G flyer then sky how high, oh I can see her

[Akon:]
I got t-pain around my wrist, Gaga around my neck
Got o' money so long, I ain't movin' cash in them checks
I keep wide 3's on my feet, still ridin' 'round with that heat
Foreign cars in my garage, all these bad bitches I beat
Oops! Is that your girl? She said her name was Nina
Oops! Ridin' 'round, gettin' head from a girl named Nina
Oops! I'm sorry, but I'm on my Ike and Tina (Ike and Tina)
I'm African so you know I got hyenas
I cashed out on my whips, I cashed out from my check
Though I ? TV again, got that stations all in my bed
Got a indoor court, outdoor court
Indoor pool, outdoor pool
I ain't lyin', nigga tell it's true
Ask Ray he done be there too

[Hook 1: Akon]
Money to blow so I'm ridin 'round with that Nina (ride 'round with that Nina)
With a Hollywood ho with lips like Angelina (lips like Angelina)
My diamonds talk for me they say how can I meet ya? (how can I meet ya?)
G flyer then sky how high, oh I can see her (oh I can see her)
Got an island on my wrist, girl, I'm cashin' out (I'm cashin' out)
Got an island on my neck, girl, I'm cashin' out (I'm cashin' out)
My diamonds talk for me they say how can I meet ya?
G flyer then sky how high, oh I can see her

[Verse 2 Cash Out]
Ok, I drop the top, hop in
Hoes they coming by flocks in
Birds they coming by flocks in
Pass them birds like Stockton
Play with my money I'm popping
No acting, but it's a movie
Got Spinz on the beat so we ain't losing
Don't act like your ho ain't choosin
I done blowed up, yeah I'm the bomb
Riding round blowing on stank bombs
Pussy so good you should thank moms
Top floor suite chilling at the Palms
We want the whole loaf leave y'all the crumbs
Til then I'm running my check up
And it's fuck a Bugatti I'm calling my jet up

[Hook]
Cool
36 O's ho riding round with that nina
Riding with a ho named Keisha, smoking on Keisha
My diamonds talk for me they say hi can I meet you
She fly high, high in the sky, ho I can't see you
Got a condo on my wrist girl, I'm cashing out
Got a condo around my neck girl, I'm cashing out
36 O's so I'm riding round with that nina
My diamonds talk for me they say hi can I meet you

[Verse 3 Cash Out]
It's big pimping over here... Church
Time to cop the Maybach already had the vert
I got big money visions, Sammy Sosa pigeons
What that mean? That mean they jumping out the kitchen
And I'm on the money mission, nobody can stop me
Just grab your camcorder, press record and gon' and watch me
And you can skate on my ice just like you playing hockey
And in the booth I beat the beat up, call me Rocky
Yeah I'm cocky

[Hook]
36 O's ho riding round with that nina
Riding with a ho named Keisha, smoking on Keisha
My diamonds talk for me they say hi can I meet you
She fly high, high in the sky, ho I can't see you
Got a condo on my wrist girl, I'm cashing out
Got a condo around my neck girl, I'm cashing out
36 O's so I'm riding round with that nina
My diamonds talk for me they say hi can I meet you

[Intro]
Yeah, let's take 'em back

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
'91, I stepped in this game
After "What's the 411?" things ain't been the same
And I can't complain
But with all this fame comes a whole lot of pain, but
I'm so glad to be here and my music's still sincere
Let's get back to the story of all this pain and glory
And '94 was my life and my life wasn't right
So I reached out to you and told you what I've been through

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & 50 Cent]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Then I came with "Share My World"
But at that point I was just a foolish girl trying to find my way
Then I dropped the Mary album
And people were saying that it's just not gonna work
And my feelings, they did hurt
But my fans showed me so much love
And I owe it all to them
Then I came with "No More Drama", I remember that week
Yeah, it was when Aaliyah died, I couldn't hardly sleep
Thought about it every day and it made me change my way
I'm a real woman now because of all of these days

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & 50 Cent]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
You remind me of a real love (You don't have to worry)
Real love
All night long I'm goin' down
Reminisce on the love we have
You are everything, love without a limit
What you gonna do without my life, my life, my life, my life?

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige & 50 Cent]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top (Hate it or love it)
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
(I'm gon' shine right now)
Go 'head, envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
Hate it or love it (I'm gon', I'm gon' shine)
I'm gon' shine (I'm gon', I'm gon' shine)
Go 'head, envy me (Hey, hey), I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me

[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
Right now I wanna thank
Each and every person out there that's ever done anything for Mary J. Blige
I wanna thank TV, radio, talk shows, friends, family
But most of all I wanna thank my fans
For hanging in there with me during the bad times
And now you're here
To see me at a point in my life where I can actually call myself a queen
And for those of you that don't like it
This is what you can do
You can do this
You can hate it or love it
Hate it or love it
Hate it or love it (Hate it)
Hate it or love it (Love it)
Hate it or love it (Hey, yeah)
Hate it or love it
Hate it or love it

[Verse 1]
First, see the city skylights shining from my room
You're such a sight to see in the month of June
Beautiful like the moon's reflection when
It's passing off your skin
And before you let me in
I hear you say, "It's been a long time"
I say, "Okay-kay-kay, don't worry, I got you"
Do you say, "How 'bout some foreplay?"
Got that, got plenty, I got you
Do you say, "Play some slow ones"
Got that Sade, Al Green, and Marvin Gaye, too
To love you gently

[Chorus]
Oooh, let me love you gently
Lay back, relax, girl I'ma be
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
'Cause daddy know just what you like
Gonna love you gently
(Gonna love you baby, gentle with you baby, ooh ooh)
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
See, I know just when to finish and I know just when to start
And I'll be loving your reaction everytime I hit that spot (gently)
But it's soft like leather (gently), but the top is hard (gently)
Whisper your pleasures (gently), then I'll do my job
Invigorating, intense, girl, let me do what I do
I don't know what's echoing louder, the music or you (gently)
I ain't close to be done yet (gently), but you're getting real warm (gently)
Like the calm of the thunder (gently), right after the storm
Do you say, you say, do you say it, girl?
I'm, gonna push it to the limit, oooh
(It's yours, it's yours)
See, second place or win the race, I'm gonna be your number one
(Til the sun shines)
Woooaaah, here comes the sun (forever more)
Let's try and taste the moon again, forever more

[Chorus]
Let me love you gently
That's the sound of love, ripping shades off the wall
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
Ooh, this might not be in the bedroom
But I'm gonna love you, girl, gently
Gonna love you gently, oooh
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
Let me touch you gently
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
Gonna love you gently (ah babe, ah baby)
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock

[Outro]
Oooooooooh, can you feel me, girl?
Aye, uh huh
We don't need no room
All we need is me and you, aye
Wanna love you

[Verse 1]
Guess who's steppin' in the room
It's ya boy Breezy, hit 'em with the auto-tune
Automatic, systematic, robo dude
'Cause I want to
I'm the kinda guy that don't follow rules
So come on, baby girl, let's break a few
Well let me say this

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on, are you sure you want to play with fire?
I'm guaranteed to take it higher
If you say you don't then you're a liar, yeah

[Chorus]
You don't want my number, baby, you don't want my math
I know what you want, I know what you want
You don't want no picture, baby, or no autograph
I know what you want, I know what you want
You want to hit it, hit it, hit it, smash
Hit it, hit it, hit it, smash
Hit it. hit it, hit it, smash

[Verse 2]
I know her game, she all the same
I don't really wanna know her name
She went downtown like a stock exchange
But all her friends kept cock blockin', man

[Chorus]
You don't want my number, baby, you don't want my math
I know what you want, I know what you want
You don't want no picture, baby, or no autograph
I know what you want, I know what you want
You want to hit it, hit it, hit it, smash
Hit it, hit it, hit it, smash
Hit it. hit it, hit it, smash
You don't want my number, baby, you don't want my math
I know what you want, I know what you want
You don't want no picture, baby, or no autograph
I know what you want, I know what you want
You want to hit it, hit it, hit it, smash
Hit it, hit it, hit it, smash
Hit it. hit it, hit it, smash

And a mourning and a gnashing of teeth
It is a weeping and a mourning
And a gnashing of teeth
When it comes to my sound which is the champion sound

[Intro]
Young love, love, love, oh, a teenage love
Young love, love, uh-huh, yeah, a teenage love
Young love, young love, young love, everything I need, I got in my young love
A teenage love, young love, young love, girl, a teenage love

[Verse 1]
Tell me what's the definition of love?
It seems like everybody thinks they done figured it out but
Every time they fall up in it, they fall out, in and out it again
Tell me how they gonna know about us
Telling me and you that we ain't even been around long enough
We can prove 'em wrong, show 'em how it's done
I know we can do it

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause if it's wilding out, we got that, and forgiving, we got that
If it's talking 'bout how we feeling, we got that
If it's hanging out, keeping it real then we got that
Me and you know what the deal is but

[Chorus]
Since we ain't twenty-one (Oh)
They be tryna say it ain't love (A teenage love)
'Cause we can't hit the clubs
They be tryna say we're too young (A teenage love)
I ain't saying that we're tryna be grown
I'm just saying that we're old enough to know
We got that young love, young love
We lucky 'cause we got that young love

[Verse 2]
It's crazy how all our friends say
That we gone, they still tryna figure us out, babe
'Cause we always together
And we don't gotta front, we ain't gotta pretend, girl
And you know a couple of 'em gon' hate (Yeah)
Talk behind your back (And), smile up in your face
Oh, girl, we can prove 'em wrong and show 'em how it's done
And, girl, I know that we can do it just because

[Pre-Chorus]
If we're wilding out, we got that, forgiving, we got that
Talking 'bout how we're feeling, we got that
If it's hanging out, keepin' it real, then we got that
Me and you know what the deal is but

[Chorus]
Since we ain't twenty-one (Oh, oh)
They be tryna say it ain't love (A teenage love)
'Cause we can't hit the clubs (Can't go up in the clubs)
They be tryna say we're too young (A teenage love)
I ain't saying that we're tryna be grown (Oh, oh)
I'm just saying that we're old enough to know
We got that young love, young love (Yeah, yeah, yeah, that young love)

Everywhere we go (Uh-huh)
You know that we got that
Young love, young love, young love (What? A teenage love, uh-huh, yeah)

Or laying at the spot (Oh)
No matter what we do (Yup)
You know they can't stop that
Young love, young love, young love
You're my young love, yeah (A teenage love)

[Chorus]
Since we ain't twenty-one (I don't care how old we are)

[Acoustic Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Hey you
Out there in the cold, getting lonely, getting old
Can you feel me?
Hey you
Standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?
Hey you
Don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Hey you
Out there on your own, sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey you
With your ear against the wall, waiting for someone to call out
Could you touch me?
Hey you
Would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high, as you can see
No matter how he tried, he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain

[Breakdown]

[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
Hey you
Out there on the road, always doing what you're told
Can you help me?
Hey you
Out there beyond the wall, breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me?
Hey you
Don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall

[Outro: Roger Waters]
(We fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall...)

[Intro]
I made this beat
Uh
Yeah
Oh, and I—and then I wrote to it too
So it go like this
It’s like real late and Jerm’s tryna get home
So I’ma try and one take a ma'fuckin' song
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse]
When you first start rappin' everybody curious
Then you make it happen and everybody furious
Young kid courteous, don’t know what the worry is
Wanna be buried in my Pittsburgh jersey, bitch
Nobody certain if you gonna make it
Life give you some hurt and then you gonna hate it
Sometimes it leave you cold and it leave you naked
But one thing for certain I’ma leave it faded
Still young but I wonder when my time gon' be up
When my time come I’ma smile and peace up
Shorty sipping forties, hangin' out by the tree stump
So Jerm and me started making hits and it occurred to me
You didn't have to be like thirty-three to start earning cheese
With uncertainty, in it for eternity
A lot of style, little money and some purple weed
Me and my queen, my girl, not Freddy Mercury
‘Cause first you work for free, anything to get noticed
Stayin' focused ’cause bullshittin' was hopeless
So treat yourself like a damn professional
Your first music check, damn incredible
Every day feel like the best day ever
Until every day feel like the best day ever
And you used to them days, kinda become a routine
You have a bad one, fuck up a good dream
You realize that you’ll probably be away when
All the people die and you never get to say
Everything you always wanted to but never got the chance to
Start to weigh you down, what can a man do?
I could’ve stayed around, probably cancelled
A couple of shows, spent the last two
Years being dumb on the road, I guess
Haven’t got to spend too much in the home
Time is what you make it, but player don’t be mistaken
All of your shit get taken
Broken, beaten oasis, still I wouldn’t trade it
Now it's five o’clock, but my mind won’t stop
I’ve been thinkin' ’bout life, pourin' syrup and pop
Smokin' cigarettes like I’m really tryna die
Try to keep my head on my shoulders but my mind in the sky
I’m that moment when a gazelle and a lion collide
I'm a burned down building with a diamond inside
Yup, independent platinum, wishing well passing
Jewel'ry out the ice age, bitch outta Maxim
I be writin' this shit and just relaxin’
Let the time start passin'

[Outro]
Yeah, so I just made this ma'fuckin' beat
And decided I was gonna rap on it too
It’s late
Yup
Took my chains off to rap this song
Ou, almost dropped my big chain *laughs*
Uh, who'd ever thought that I’d be standing in a booth with a big chain?
Sike, I’m joking, I don’t got another verse
All right, peace

[Intro]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Chorus]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick, oh

[Verse 2]
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Chorus]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after's did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone

[Bridge]
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Now baby, don't hang up
So I can tell you what you need to know
I'm begging you, just please don't go
So I can tell you what you need to know

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all these fairytales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone

[Intro]

Ain't rollin like R. Spend money like R
Bend you over, pull your hair and stroke it like R
These vezo jeans rocking stilletos
Plus you so hood, word to the ghetto

[Pre Chorus]

She started clapping it, I started grabbing it
And then I whispered in her ear, and told her lets get outta here

[Intro]
Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh

[Verse 1]
Close your eyes and clone yourself
Build your heart an army
To defend your innocence
While doing everything wrong
Don't be scared to walk alone
Don't be scared to like it
There's no time that you must be home
So sleep where darkness falls

[Chorus]
Alive in the age of worry
Smile in the age of worry
Go out in the age of worry
And say, "Worry, why should I care?"

Ooh! Ooh!

[Verse 2]
No, your fight is not with them
Yours is with your time here
Dream your dreams, but don't pretend
Make friends with what you are
Give your heart and change your mind
You're allowed to do it
Because God knows it's been done to you and
Somehow you got through it

[Chorus]
Alive in the age of worry
Smile in the age of worry
Go out in the age of worry
And say, "Worry, why should I care?"

[Outro]
Rage in the age of worry
Act your age in the age of worry
And say, "Worry, get out of here"

[Intro]
See when I do joints like these
I do it for the young'en in the ghetto
That you ain't go'n never hear his story
'Cause he ain't gonna make it to tell ya
So you know what's crazy?
I went to court the other day, the D.A. say she hate me
How you gonna hate me when me and Lou just took 20 racks
And put coats on them kids back
It's 30 degrees outside

[Verse 1]
24, how could I ask for more?
I got my deals, it's gettin' real, I'm makin' cash fo' sure
Stuntin' every chance I get, because I had it poor
But every time I go to sleep I hear the devil at my door
And I'm on them papers so them courts I'm goin' back and forth
Dealing with probation, man, they all said I'd be back for sure
Mommies turned to zombies from that raw
Because it's crack galore
You wonder why them babies runnin' crazy 'steady clappin' off
Gettin' life before they get pussy
Cause ain't nobody love'em so they lives get took'en
Locked in cages, have'em fighting over cookies
And lunch trays, just happy them days ain't never killed 'em
Yeah, I remember, it was a hot December
Niggas die on top of winter
Cause them kids need them toys
Well, Santa Claus don't see them boys
Or see the girls around here, there's Jack boys down stairs
No man with the big bag, just man with the big gat
Try and take your shit back cause he feel the world owe 'em
And his daughter want a Barbie bike for Christmas
He goin' show her, that the love is there, no mother there
Just her little brother there
We wash our pain with Belvedere
And use the drugs they brung us here
We get high to get by, hot dogs, no ribeyes
With tears drip from red eyes
When ends don't meet the dead lines
The D.A. said she hate me, but I don't understand
When I just rock the show in front of 50,000 fans
I think that bitch racist, she probably in the Klan
She take her pain out on me, but she probably need a man
I took my mom from public housin', put her in the sticks
We came a long way from welfare and gettin W.I.C
That shit just made me hungry
And now we gettin' rich, and all these niggas gettin' sick
I know they wanna get me hit cause I'm ballin'
Yeah, cause I'm ballin'

[Outro]
It's like sometimes I always gotta let these type of joints go man
Just speakin' to the streets
That bitch said she hate me
I felt some type of way about that
Last night we just came out
Giving 2, 3 hundred pair of shoes to the schools
To the girls and the boys basketball teams
How you hate me?
You hate me cause I'm doin' what I'm suppose to do'
And I got that money and I'm making more money than you
Well, bitch you can hate me for that
Let's get it

[Verse 1]
Now the cover of a Rolling Stone
Ain't the cover of a Rolling Stone
And the music on my radio
Isn't supposed to make me feel alone

[Pre-Chorus]
What a drag to know
I have to learn to let it go

[Chorus]
Show me something I can be
Play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me

[Verse 2]
Well they’re celebrating broken things
I don’t want a world of broken things
You can tell something isn't right
When all your heroes are in black and white

[Pre-Chorus]
What a drag to say
At least I still have yesterday

[Chorus]
Show me something I can be
Play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me
Someone come speak for me

[Bridge]
I'm not mad about it
But I'm not mad about it
I'm not mad about it
But I'm not that mad about it

[Chorus]
Show me something I can be
Play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me

[Outro]
Now the cover of a Rolling Stone
Ain't the cover of a Rolling Stone

[Chorus: Uncle Chucc]
Ooh-hoo (Ah)
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do (Wonder, wonder, wonder what it do)
Ooh-hoo (Woo)
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do

[Verse 1: Uncle Chucc]
They say his Escalade '64 on Vogues
In the game, pain still the same, they knocking at your door
Ooh, you wanna only talk bad (Wanna only talk bad)
It's a sad, sad thing, you dirty low down

[Chorus: Uncle Chucc]
Ooh-hoo (I wonder)

Wa-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (Won't you tell me now?)
Wa-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (Snoop Dogg)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg & Uncle Chucc]
Independent, I'm in it, been getting my cash right
Walking through the daytime holding my flashlight
Spliff-ted, high as I could ever be
I'm lifted, drifting on the memory
My style, my tone, my delivery
My maze is Frankie Beverly
Heavily influenced, I do it like you can't
I'm the weed to the Zag with the bag of the drink
Get live, that's five on the black hand side
Now try to stay fly with a piece of the pie
I heard fish don't burn in the kitchen
The baby gangsters, they get in the hood and on a mission
Uh, you pump 'em, up they fuck it up
Now what you need to do is toughen up
Now chuck it up, what it do, dog?
I thought you wanted to be like big (Snoop Dogg)

[Chorus: Uncle Chucc]
Ooh-hoo
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do (Wonder, wonder, wonder what it do)
Ooh-hoo (Tell me)
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg & Uncle Chucc, Snoop Dogg, Uncle Chucc]
When I get lost (When I get lost)
I feel like a boss (Feel like a boss)
She will be my salvation (Marijuana-uana-uana)
And when I feel low (I feel low)
With nowhere to go (Nowhere to go)
She'll be my inspiration (Marijuana-uana-uana-uana)
She never spends (She never spends)
Time with her friends (Nuh-uh, nuh-uh)
Tells me she's blue without me
And when things go wrong (Yeah)
Her faith is strong
I know that she'll never doubt me
(Hey, Snoop Dogg)

[Chorus: Uncle Chucc & Snoop Dogg]
Ooh-hoo (What it do? What it do?)
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do (Yeah, wonder, wonder, wonder what it do, I wonder what it do)
Ooh-hoo (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I wonder what it do)
I wonder, wonder, wonder what it do (Get your groove on, uh, yeah)

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (Do it make you feel good?)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (Do it make you feel good?)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (Do it make you feel good?)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la (Do it make you feel good?)
Uh
"Take a sip"
Whaaat? Uh

[Verse]
I know you're thinkin', "Well, goddamn, what he drinkin'?
The crooked letter, no other beer feel better
I used to be a hustler, now I'm a twenty-two brew guzzler
Other beers, I'm not lovin' ya
Forget the great taste that's less fillin'
I'd rather have some Ides and some dimes in the crib chillin'
Or in the six relaxin', honeys in the back
Crackin' six-packs, rubbin' my back
"Big Poppa, you all that" - that's what they whisper
"Hey mister, do you have the beer with the eye on the twister?"
He points to the freezer, me bein' a playa
Big Poppa, show stoppa, throw ya cans in the air!
From Bed-Stuy to Van Nuys
St. Ides make eyes droop like Chinese, so why try these?
Other beers just don't pass the test
S-T dot I-D-E to the S
And I'm out!

[Intro]
Love is a Verb
It ain't a thing

[Verse 1]
It's not something you hold
It's not something you scream
When you show me love
I don't need your words

[Chorus]
Yeah, love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
Love ain't a thing
Love is a verb

[Verse 2]
Love ain't a crutch
It's not an excuse
No you can't get through love
On just a pile of IOU's
Love ain't a drug
Despite what you've heard

[Chorus]
Yeah, love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
Love ain't a thing
Love is a verb

[Bridge]
So you've got to show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Love is a verb
So you've got to show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Love is a verb

[Outro]
Love ain't a thing
Love is a verb

[Verse 1]
We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you want love we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

[Chorus]
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland

[Verse 2]
Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when
Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

[Pre-Chorus]
You want love, we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

[Chorus]
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
(I'll never speak again, again
I'll use my hands)

[Bridge]
Damn, baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine all mine, all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes

[Chorus]
Your body is a wonderland (I'll never speak again, again)
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland (I'll never speak again, again)
Your body is a wonderland (I'll use my hands)

Philly
Take 'em back to the plat', Meek!

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Middle of the summer
Middle of the summer
In the middle of the summer
I used to play the block all night 'til the sun came up
Everybody got they gun game up
In the middle of the summer
Middle of the summer
Middle of the summer

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Stack all winter just to stunt in the summer
Riding in my new Camaro, sometimes I wonder
Will it take me under or will it make me stronger?
Thinking the times when I was broke it only gave me hunger
Shorty walking through the block it only made me want her
My homies were selling dope, and doing Jay-Z numbers
The nigga Moochie's wrist was cold and throwing AC Numbers
They only use to front us O’s, used to say we youngins
But we was ready though
Around the time when all the Roc was on the radio
Me and my niggas on the block with hammers heavy though
I used to put it in my hand ain't wanna let it go
Ain't wanna let it go, no
The work was low, the numbers was right
Used to play the summer league, couple youngins was nice
They ain't make it to the league 'cause it'll fuck up your life
In the middle of the summer when you fucking with white

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Middle of the summer
Middle of the summer
In the middle of the summer
I used to play the block all night 'til the sun came up
Everybody got they gun game up
In the middle of the summer
Middle of the summer
Middle of the summer

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Charlie Mack was marching through screaming stop the violence
He had Will Smith with him tried to stop the wilding
But as soon as they left the hood, man shots was fired
Ambulances was rushing, somebody mama crying
They say the good don't make it here
Ain't no fighting hammer time and they gon' take it there
NARCs rushing, cops lock you like Jamaican hair
Young bull, sixteen, and got eighty years
Middle of the summer, people cooking out, old heads looking out
Rest in peace tees for the soldiers that got tooken out
I was in the streets, momma told me to be in the house
Ten o'clock I was on the block, moving in and out
City of brotherly love
I was only thirteen, I seen a puddle of blood
Grown man laying there, he got one in his mug
His grandma screaming, "Told you about selling them drugs!"

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Middle of the summer
Middle of the summer
In the middle of the summer
I used to play the block all night 'til the sun came up
Everybody got they gun game up
In the middle of the summer
Middle of the summer
Middle of the summer

[Verse 3: Mel Love]
It was the middle of the summer
But it was feeling like the winter
July was feeling like December
We ball hard to the finish, uh
They say I'm cold 'cause I'm a winner
We had a quarter brickies, half of birdies
Stash box ride super dirty
Tryna get that money, ziplocks, nose candy
Back to back in them black caddies
And we said this is our summer, and we taking it there
I'm all up in this mirror, like look at this Audemar
Standing in my rear while starin at this painted mirror
Still tryna get it square, super fly how we live
Aw knocked out lights coming
NARC'd out mean a bike's coming
Smelling two stroke
These Philly streets will make you lose hope
Her son was murdered now she use coke
It was the

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Middle of the summer
Middle of the summer
In the middle of the summer
I used to play the block all night 'til the sun came up
Everybody got they gun game up
In the middle of the summer
Middle of the summer
Middle of the summer

[Intro: B.o.B]
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah...

[Hook: B.o.B]
I feed this streets, (These streets)
From the East Side back to the West Side, (To the West Side)
And you can ask about me, (About me)
They'll tell ya from the North to the South Side, (The South Side)
I feed these streets, (Yeah), these streets, (Yeah), These streets
From the East to the West Side
I feed these streets, (Yeah), these streets, (Yeah), These streets
From the North to the South Side, (I Feed these streets)

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, well...
It all started off a candy roll
Yes in the area that we know, it's 404
From open mic nights to getting boo'd at talent shows
But still I gotta be unstoppable like Santigold
There for I handle flows, with that Atlanta soul
Even my grandma knows that I got that antidote
I'm so exquisite with these lyrics I immaculately spit it
Even though I'm from the South I got that gramma' though
They still be hatin' on the South but that's my family though
So I'mma feed em with this truth until I'm banished for it
And they'll still be many soldiers 'round the globe
So even if they kill me they'll be many more

[Hook: B.o.B]

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
I welcome you into my mind state
Now follow me back into the dungeon that's where I would lay
With no doors, no windows just a fire place
So hot summers, cold winters as the climate change
I used to roll with savages and primates
But it never my anger pinned up inside to boost the crime rate
Until I found a studio where I would hibernate
N' maybe lay a verse or two down that I would make
All though I'm dancing with a devil on a blind date
I'm still feeding these streets as we migrate
Into the area of unknown
With one song I could make ya trunk vibrate

[Hook: B.o.B]

[Intermission: B.o.B]
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

[Hook: B.o.B]
Over and over and over again
You say that we're just friends
Forget the implications
Infatuations end
If love's so easy, why is it hard
I can't imagine ever being apart

I'll come back to you
It'll be brand new
But I promise
We're just friends

Over and over and over again
I try to make amends
For everything that I've done wrong
My whole world just spins
Make some coffee, hold me up
Try to talk me out of giving up

I'll come back to you
It'll be brand new
But I promise
We're just friends

[Intro: Childish Gambino]
Yuh, ahehe
Ayy, it's- this is royalty, right?
Yeah, we royalty, you ain't even know that?
You gotta use the royal "we" around us
It's royalty

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Who the fuck Gambino? (Uh)
This nigga on yo' TiVo? (Uh)
My hotel cost a kilo, we bankin' like a free throw (Woo!)
Fuck y'all, we A-Team, y'all plan B like Walgreens
Cop that shit and paint it black, niggas want they summer back?
Ha-ha, no way (Uh), hublots, Dolce
Beans in my hand, girl in the car
She still with her man, but she seein' me tomorrow (Woo!)
Homegirl on that Master P, watch us ball like referees (Ah!)
Unnecessary roughness? We just tryna function (Ayy)
Used to sport them Filas 'cause my cousin pack them heaters
We don't wife 'em like Khalifa (Nah)
We just party then we leave 'em
Tell 'em that we hittin', we don't really see 'em
My girl look best when she only wear a fitted
Q and 'Bino in the house and you niggas in the Senate
Get it?

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Four thou' on my fit, that's unnecessary
Skiing in Japan, that's unnecessary
Molly on my rider, that's unnecessary
'Bino spit the fire, that ain't even necessary
That's unnecessary, that's unnecessary
That's unnecessary, that's unnecessary
Roll out on a plane, that's unnecessary
'Tussin and champagne, nigga, that ain't even necessary

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Yo, they said don’t buy the belt and I got it (Yeah)
They said don’t get the Rollie and I bought it, uh (Yo)
Nigga, I’m ballin' (Uh)
My fuckin' mixtape can get you through college (Yeah)
Gettin' them dollars (Yeah)
Showin' my pearly white teeth, I'm a nigga that’s flawless (Yeah-yeah)
Came a long way from dumpin' out Impalas (Yeah-yeah)
Same gun and pants, different ski mask from coppers
All of this copper
Knock knock, who could it be? Niggas know I got it on lock (Uh)
Yawk, yawk (Yawk)
Bitch rappers better move ‘fore them niggas get dropped
(Uh) Uh, uh (Uh)
Mr. Flop boy, you got your label hot (Yeah, yeah)
I’m the hardest out, you's a table cloth (Yeah, yeah-yeah)
Unnecessary ballin', I was carted off, uh
Been fucking with my side bitch so much
My main bitch can’t stand it (Huh, yeah, yeah)
Hunnid racks in three months, man this shit is outstanding, uh
(Yeah, yeah-yeah)
Seen a dollar go to stupid racks, billion, trillion
Nigga, that’s what I call building
‘Bino what it do? Let’s go half on a million

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Bathroom DVR, that’s unnecessary (Ayy)
Pushin' in that bulletproof, that’s unnecessary (Ayy)
Stuntin' in the mall, that’s unnecessary (Uh)
Condo on my arm, that ain't even necessary
That’s unnecessary, that’s unnecessary (Woo!)
That’s unnecessary, that’s unnecessary (Uh!)
Ibiza for a day, that’s unnecessary (Bino!)
Show's a hundred K (Royalty!), nigga, that ain’t even necessary

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Bl-bl-bla-black Lip Bastard, actual natural disaster
I did a song about DMT, Soulja Boy did one right after-er-er-er
3 eyes, these guys ain’t seein' me
No radio showed up over B.o.B
G-O-D MC, I’m the devil with angel wings
Pilot Talk, currency (Soulo), stole the show, burglary (Soulo)
I love that flow but I got more (Soulo)
Open condoms in condos (Soulo)
Open bottles of Moet (Soulo)
White with white girls in Eugene (Soulo)
We used to call hoes on 3-way (Soulo)
And take 'em out to the movies (Soulo)
And now we just do it our way (Soulo)
She drivin' stick in the driveway (Soulo)
Just popped a molly with Miley (Soulo)
She do shrooms every blue moon (Soulo, molly on my rider)
Hundred million trillion motherfuckin' racks, nigga (Nigga)
Pinot Grigio the lean’ll go in that, nigga (Nigga)
Now that's unnecessary, been a legend since elementary
Ayo, Bino, tell these niggas I ain't no joke
She don't need speak, she ain't giving no throat
You are under my control, suspend the L's but I'm on a roll
Grade A, honor roll, mayday, Soul!

[Verse 1]
Now and then I pace my place
I can't retrace how I got here
I cheat the light to check my face
It's slightly harder than last year

[Chorus]
But all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
Because one of these days I'll be born and raised
And it’s such a waste to grow up lonely

[Verse 2]
I still have dreams, they’re not the same
They don’t fly as high as they used to
I saw my friend, he's in my head
And he said, “You don’t remember me do you?”

[Chorus]
But all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
Because one of these days I'll be born and raised
And it’s such a waste to grow up lonely

[Verse 3]
Still got time, still got faith
I call on both of my brothers
Got a mom, got a dad
But they do not have each other

[Outro]
So line on up and take your place
Show your face to the morning
Because one of these days you’ll be
Born and raised and it
All comes up without warning

[Verse 1]
Well, Olivia is taken
But a look like hers can be found from time to time
Yeah, Olivia is taken
But a look like hers can be found from time to time

[Chorus]
I'm thinking something like Olivia is
What I need to find

[Verse 2]
There's only one man in this world
Who gets to sleep with her by his side
There's only one man in this world
Who gets to sleep with her by his side

[Chorus]
I'm thinking something like Olivia
Could keep me through the night

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Now I'm not trying to steal
No love away from no one man
Now I'm not trying to steal
No love away from no one man

But if Olivia herself were at my door
I'd have to say, I'd let her in

[Bridge]
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia

[Chorus]
I keep thinking something like Olivia
Is what I need to find

[Bridge]
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia

I keep thinking something like Olivia
I'm ridin' in a Caddy
Stuntin' like my daddy
Rollin up my girlfriend her first name Mary
Last name Jane
Look at these chains
Afro, Nappy Boy call me T-Pain
Bitches hit my phone but see I'm probably on the plane
And my eyes low
Like I'm Liu Kang
Niggas want that flame so I supply it and it's perfect
Hear 'em hatin' some new sucka niggas try it but it's worthless
I'm Barry White deep
You guys are on the surface
Some niggas want the green
But I be where the purp is
Wit ya main bitch she forgotten where her skirt is
Heard my album drop and now you kinda gettin' nervous
See I be goin' hard
Cause this is what I do
I roll another one and tell that bitch to get a clue
It's hard for me to name all a the places I done flew
I did it all by reppin' Taylor Gang and stayin' true
Ya dig?

[Verse 1]
My right hand to God
Left hand holding the jewels
And I'm swearing up and down
The tide stole my youth
The creases in my brow ain't tan lines
Saltwater swole my eyes
The sun burnt me black and blue
Too cold this side of June

[Refrain 1]
It ain't natural

[Verse 2]
Right hand in yours
Left hand holding the jewels
When that jungle flower blooms
Better leave it in the ground
Don't try to cut it out
The creases in your brow ain't tan lines
Saltwater swole my eyes
The sun burnt you black and blue on your green eyes
Too cold this side of June

[Refrain 2]
That ain't natural

[Bridge]
I'll rebel, I'll rebel
But this ain't natural
I'll take care, I'll take care
If this ain't going well
I'm no match for you
This isn't hard to tell
That it ain't going well

[Verse 3]
When we're under the palm trees
Thinking heaven must be
Somewhere under these palm trees
With all the hell we're raising
At least we had the palm trees
To save us from the ray beams
But not even the palm trees
Could save us from the flames
Summer remains, ooh
Oh, summer remains
Oh yeah, summer remains
Summer remains

Wannabe gangstas into maggot food
But would it hurt a nigga with the truth to kill him with a lie
Creep my man all you wanna do is get a nigga high

In the darkest days, the rain that falls
Hear me from the life that calls
And all the things I need to find an answer for
But in the end I know I'll see
The truth in all that I believe
I do what I gotta do
Cause I know that this is where I wanna be

[Verse 1: DMX]
Got a lot to say, but don't know who to talk to
Step with a purpose, but don't know where to walk to
Anything I ever said, ever meant something?
I know, because the person I said it to, told me it meant something
My life has a meaning, my life has a purpose
No matter how dark it gets, I knew that it was worth it
Fuck what it looked like on the surface
Seen it all, but not all heard us, like sometimes i was worthless
Can't expect everybody to get what you doing
Can't expect them all to be with what you doing
Don't give a fuck if a motherfucker hate me
What you think it is with me, but whats good with you lately
I hate when i sense this shit, trying to make sense of this shit knowing that its sensitive shit
Niggas so dumb, that they don't even censor shit
You sent the shit, so I know you meant the shit you senseless bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Stan]
Born with addiction with fast living with high stakes
I race down a highway of life with no breaks
Make no apologies for the risks that I take
And manning up to the repercussions that I face
No silver spoon, I was raised in a crowded room
Rarely seen the sun, faced a lot of gloom
I hit the streets too soon before 21
Working on the clock since and on it until I'm done
I'm never clocking out, but always locking in
I had a warm heart, lost a lot of friends
And losing them make me feel like I was drowning
So please forgive the chill I know you feel when you around me
Dreamed of living right, big family, the picket fence
Grandkids I will get to share my story with
But here I am, living vile as I stand ground
Just hope it doesn't end, with shots fired, man down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: DMX]
If I could bottle the inspiration
I'd be a billionaire, straight fuckin villain yeah
X, baby you still in here
I feel the air, I can smell the death in it
We were all left in it, so fuck nigga, step with it
The walk is easy, the journey ain't worth nothing
That's why every day a nigga wanna hurt something
But, I made progress, more or less
If I can avoid the stress, I can avoid the rest
A nigga stay dealing with the bullshit daily
Niggas is worse than the bitches, y'all hear me?
Straight up and fed up (what!), i'll have you sprayed up and wet up (what!)
Now you laid up and won't get up
Now look at what the fuck you got yourself into
All I did was open the curtains and you jumped out the window
That's what suckers do
You just a punk motherfucker you, got a nigga like motherfucker OOH!

[Hook]

[Intro]
What?
Where my dogs at?
Where my dogs at?
Where my dogs at?
Where my dogs at?

[Verse]
You can try but I do fight, just can't seem to do right
Can't run with the big dogs, his jeans is too tight
I've been doing this for too long, plus dog is too strong
Let you catch, fight me off the map with a new song
Man you know you wrong, trying that shit there
Yeah a nigga went there, all you do is sit there
I've been rapping for 20 years and you 20 years old
X back on the block nigga, you lucky if you go Gold
There's a new sheriff in town, just been re-elected
You ain't gonna like it, but respect, nigga check it
I'mma get it in till the nigga wins with the dividends
We gon' walk these dogs 'til the bitter end
You like, oh it's him again, I knew that's how you felt
Pussy, I knew that's how you smelt
But you cats still playing around with just beats
Talking about what you got, ain't air in the teeth
You can put on a vest, but I'mma still stop it
Cause I got a chopper that sound like a helicopter
And niggas really don't want me to pop the trunk
We gon' either chop or slump when I cock and dump
Whether the Glock or pump, cats ain't ready
Half from here to here, lookin like spaghetti
Pull out the machete, hack off the limbs
Bag up the pieces, wipe off the Timbs
Jump in the Benz, five cars deep
4 o'clock in the morning, riders still asleep
Shut shit down whenever we hit town
GIVE A NIGGA PASS! I lay my dick down
You can, bring out the best or, bring out the worst
You gon' bring out the worst, we gon' bring out the hearse
Niggas play poker, I play poke-her
Hit her from ear to ear make her smile like The Joker!

[Tyrese]
Knaw'm'sayin'?
All you funny style new bitches
Y'all break out when the heat come down the pipe
Knaw'm'sayin'? I fuck with the real bitches that's there when the nigga--
Y'knaw'mean? When I just need that phone call
When she can see it in my eyes like, fuck what I'm sayin', I'm fucked up
You see there? You know what I'm saying that's--
She got a nigga back, man
All that other shit: that's that 2010 love, you bitches is new bitches, y'knaw'mean?
We, we talking about-- We talking about, the ones that really know what love is like
Fuck the exterior, know a nigga heart
Know the content of my heart
She got a nigga back, man

[DMX]
Fuck the new bitches
We talking about the true bitches

[Tyrese]
Yeah, X said it: fuck the new bitches
We talking about the true bitches
Knaw'm'sayin'?
You bitches finding out how to love from reading Essence magazine and shit
Fuck outta here, man
You ain't gonna find love in them pages
It's acting

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerers of death's construction
In the fields, the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh, Lord, yeah

[Bridge]
Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that all to the poor, yeah
Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait till their judgment day comes, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Now, in darkness, world stops turning
Ashes where their bodies burning
No more war pigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of Judgment, God is calling
On their knees, the war pigs crawling
Begging mercies for their sins
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings
Oh, Lord, yeah

[Instrumental Outro: Luke's Wall]

[Verse 1]
Midnight rush with a pen in my hand
Inkin' Lincoln, sanskrit with a fan
Rememberin' me before we began
Sometimes I felt so Def in the Jam
But the ones who loved me told me to stop
Like, "Homegirl can't catch shit if it drop"
A superwoman chick, you know that I am
Some shit don't fly by me in a man

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I do not accept any less
Than someone just as real, as fabulous

[Chorus]
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone who's got the flavor
But don't have no follow-through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers
Don't want any paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta

[Verse 2]
Got something really shiny to start
Want me to sign there on your Range Rover heart
I’ve heard it before, yeah, the dinners were nice
'Til your diamond words melted into some ice
You shoulda been rappin' to the beat of my song
Mr. California, paper ganster-a
I'm lookin' for love, not an empty page
Full of stuff that means nothin' but "you’ve been played"

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I do not accept any less
Than someone just as real, as fabulous

[Chorus]
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone who's got the flavor
But don't have no follow-through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers
Don't want no paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta (gangsta, gangsta)
Don't want no paper gangsta (gangsta, gangsta, gangsta)

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone who's got the flavor
But don't have no follow-through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone who's got the flavor
But don't have no follow-through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers
Don't want no paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta

[Verse 1]
Goodbye cold, goodbye rain
Goodbye sorrow, and goodbye shame

I'm headed out west with my headphones on
Boarded a flight with a song in the back of my soul
And no one knows

[Chorus]
I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down

[Verse 2]
Hello beauty, hello strange
Hello wonder, what's your name?
Looking for the Sun that Neil Young hung
After the Gold Rush of 1971

[Chorus]
I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down

[Electric country blues guitar bridge]

[Verse 3]
If you see her, say hello
Just don't tell me, I told you so
Joni wrote "Blue" in her house by the sea
I've got to believe there's another color waiting on me
To set me free

[Chorus]
I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down

[Instrumental outro]

[Verse 1]
If I ever get around to living
I'm going to put my things away
In the drawers and in the closets
And there I'll stay
Stay
If I ever get around to living
It's going to be just like I dreamed
I'm going to take the love I'm given
And set it free
Free

[Verse 2]
If I ever get around to living
I'll take the end of every day
Tie it up to every morning
And sail away
Away
Free
Free

[Verse 3]
Maybe it's all a dream I'm having at seventeen
I don't have tattoos
And very soon, mother will be calling me
Saying, "Come upstairs, you've got some work to do"

[Chorus]
When are you going to wise up boy?
When are you going to wise up boy?
When are you going to wise up boy?
When are you going to wise up boy?

[Verse 4]
You are hiding in your mind
Working all the time
Trying to make it better than you got it
And you been spending all your time
Searching for a sign
That's never going to look the way you want it

[Outro]
I think you better wise up, boy
I think you better wise up, boy
I think you better wise up, boy
I think you better wise up, boy
Please dont turn me off..

Yea, its yo boy..you know what fuck an introduction. know what I mean

CHORUS

This ain't no demo, this ain't no demo
I said, im high as a kite, im high as a kite

[Verse 1]
Walt Grace
Desperately hating his whole place
Dreamed to discover a new space
And buried himself alive

Inside his basement
Tongue on the side of his face meant
He's working away on displacement
And what it would take to survive

[Pre-Chorus]
Because when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
And his wife told his kids he was crazy
And his friends said he'd fail if he'd try

[Chorus]
But with the will to work hard
And a library card
He took a homemade, fan-blade
One-man submarine ride

[Verse 2]
That morning
The sea was mad and I mean it
Waves as big as he'd seen it
Deep in his dreams at home

From dry land
He rolled it over to wet sand
Closed the hatch up with one hand
And peddled off alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
And for once in his life it was quiet
As he learned how to turn in the tide

[Chorus]
And the sky was a flare
As he came up for air
In his homemade, fan-blade
One-man submarine ride

[Verse 3]
One evening
When weeks had passed since he's leaving
The call she planned on receiving
Finally made it home
She accepted
The news she never expected
The operator connected
The call from Tokyo

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
Now his friends bring him up when they're drinking
At the bar with his name on the side

[Chorus]
And they smile when they can
As they speak of the man
Who took a homemade, fan-blade
One-man submarine ride

[Verse 1]
We pick up in New York City
I'm tryna find a man I never got to be
But when I push down on the pavement
I found the whole thing so much harder than it seemed

The only deal I ever signed
No devil drew a dotted line
The stage was set, the words were mine
I'm not complaining

[Chorus]
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
It's just a phase, it's not forever
It's just a phase, but I still might have a ways to go

[Verse 2]
Every night around this time
My friends and I, we treat it like a race
When I really start to break it down
I wouldn't trust a girl who knew about this place
Barking on with no one left
Speak softly underneath my breath
"Hey world, you ain't seen nothing yet"
Great, now it's raining

[Chorus]
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
It's just a phase, it's not forever
It's just a phase, but I still might have a ways to go

[Bridge]
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water sleep
Dreamed somebody missed me
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
And repeat and repeat after me

[Chorus]
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
It's just a phase, it's not forever
It's just a phase, but I still might have a ways to go

[Outro]
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Cut me off and pour me in the street

[Verse 1]
I am an architect
Of days that haven't happened yet
I can't believe a month is all it's been

You know my paper heart
The one I filled with pencil marks
I think I might have gone and inked you in

[Chorus]
Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song of your heart
And a face to call home, a face to call home
You got a face to call home

[Verse 2]
So glad you didn't see
The nervous wreck I used to be
You'd never know a man could feel so small
And you never look at me
Like I'm a liability
I bet you think I've never been at all

[Chorus]
Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song of your heart
And a face to call home, a face to call home
You got a face to call home, a face to call home
A face to call home
You got a face to call home

[Bridge]
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
I'm talking about all of the time
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
I'm talking about all of the time

[Chorus]
Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song of your heart
And a face to call home, a face to call home
You got a face to call home

[Outro]
Home home
Home home
Home home
Home home

[Intro]
One, two
One, two, three

[Chorus]
Born and raised
Locks of brown, streaks of gray
I was brought up in brighter days
It's good to say, "Now I'm born and raised"

[Verse]
Born and raised
In half the time I'll be twice my age
Better learn how to turn the page
Because time is strange when you're born and raised

[Chorus]
Born and raised
Locks of brown, streaks of gray
I was brought up in brighter days
It's good to say, "Now I'm born and raised"

[Chorus]
Oh, it takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
Oh, and I'm just the fool for you

[Verse 1]
I really did it to myself I guess
I saw you standing in that cocktail dress
Oh, call the press and say my life is a mess
Because I must confess to you

[Chorus]
Oh, it takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
Oh, and I'm just the fool for you

[Verse 2]
Fool me once and it's shame on you
Twice it's shame on me
But fool me baby for the rest of my life
And I'll be happy, happy as a broken man can be

[Chorus]
Oh, it takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
Oh, and I'm just the fool for you

[Outro]
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you

[Intro]
Uh, yeah
This how we do this
Sick boi
Gonna show y'all how I does
Childish, Gambino
Gambino, on the real
Let's do it

[Verse 1]
Girl show your wobble out
I'm not Queen Latifah but I set it off
I'm lookin like a tight rainbow, Kangols, got my blue roos
Lookin' like candy so I'm goodie two shoes
Call me Sproose Goose cause my clothes so fly
I'm not Howard Hughes, but I'm not a sane guy
I'm a Big Mac, you just a small fry
Tryin' so hard to get that swagger like mine
I got them steps on my head I guess my mind wanders
Try to emulate my lifestyle like condoms
I'm fly on the mic, I'm fly as a DJ
I keep a thick chick on the wire like Wee-Bey
He say she say that I'm so handsome
And play keep away from his girl like ransom
Sorry that your girls all heroes like Sylar
You know I'm from the south, I stay dirty like Tyler

[Hook]
So sick wit it that they call me Ebola

[Verse 2]
My boom box handy, blastin' that stink
You can Marcus like Camby they call me the Tech
Cause nobody can touch me, I'm fire with a fade
I ain't a lazy boy but I'm always gettin laid
I'm jack of all trades I can do no wrong
I make a huge fart and it sound like a song
I talk jibber jabber and it comes out words
I shit out diamonds, you flossin my turds
I don't like ice...a little bit of gold and I'm nice
The Cool Kids understand my plight
I'm a simple Sam, I'm only sick wit it cause that's who I am
I keep that shit slick like my name was Pam
And even if I didn't
I'd be the flyest nigga drivin' around in a Civic
And for those who didn't get it you should play it back
I'm sick like a dog on crack, for realer

[Hook]

[Verse 1: DMX]
It's like a walk in the park
She even fuck with a nigga in the dark
She's been fucking with a nigga from the start
Cause she fucked with a nigga from the heart
Man, it don't get no realer
See her fucking with another nigga, I kill her
That's how much I feel her
It's like I'm the fiend and she's the dealer
That's my baby
She's the only one that make me crazy
Ain't no maybes, never acts shady
And at the end of the day, still my lady

[Hook: Tyrese]
Say what you want, that's my baby
Only one that drives me crazy
End of the day, she's still my lady
She got my back, I got hers
She got my back, I got hers
She got my back, I got hers
She got my back, I got hers
Bigger than words

[Verse 2: DMX]
Hey, something special about her
And it ain't even the pussy, I just can't live without her
Independent shit, yeah she work
Strong, but if I do wrong, then yeah she hurt
Hey, we all got feelings
What we feel is so real, it's straight to the ceiling
After a long day of robbing and stealing
A nigga come home for some (sexual healing)
That's my boo
Only she understand what I been through
She got my heart, and it do what it do
I love you, baby

[Hook: Tyrese]

[Verse 3: DMX]
Man, I went to school with her
Since 14, I was fool with her
I see her bent over, I shot pool with her
Bitch was so bad, didn't know what to do with her
In the hood, she was that chick
And I was that nigga who with that bitch
And if went and I lost my life
I'd die knowing she was my wife, I'd rest in peace

[Hook: Tyrese]

[Hook]
They want that young nigga dumb, who you with, where you from shit
That gang banging, rag hanging, what you claiming crunk shit
(Hey!) They like that
(Hey!) They on that
(Hey!) They like that
(Hey!) They want that
They want that super gutter ignorant, that new ghetto belligerent
Authentic brick flipping dope boy trap nigga shit
(Hey!) Yeah they like that
(Hey!) They on that
(Hey!) They like that
(Hey!) Yeah they want that

[Verse 1]
They want banana clip in, chicken flipping, pistol gripping roll out
Music do that shit so good cause that's the shit I know 'bout
Money over everybody, trapping when its cold out
Give me mine grind then go shine til I'm sold out
Keep a K and some yay, no hesitation I'll spray whoever in a nigga way
Os of the haze only thing a nigga blaze
Gang bangers and J's in projects where a nigga stay
In my baby mama Section-8 apartment
Okay now everybody know me bitch I'm hot
If you want it, ho I got it, you can fuck with me or not
Still riding 24's, pockets full of cheddar now
If you trapping I'll be out soon as I handle my B.I
I'm trying to dodge the FBI who knew one day I'd be T.I
Chevy sitting real high, same clothes still fly
That's the shit them young niggas out there wanna hear about

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Gangster walking
See me approach with caution
Louis belt around my waistline, pistol hanging off it
Fuck them niggas who be talking, they can get it if they want it
Still hanging on the corner, slanging crack and marijuana
Still the man in my trap
Disappeared from the feds, they ran in my trap
Took a half-key, hundred grand, and my strap
Only thing I got now is the 9 in my lap
Better double, triple it whip it get it to selling
Get rich and get out the game 'fore snitches can get to telling
Magician with it Magellan, already a felon
Ain't even fired up the dro and they already can smell it
Wee hours of the morn I'mma hustle till it's all gone
Nigga better recognize my grind
Bank roll over all never mind my shine
If you banging let me see your gang sign one time

[Intro]
I can’t help but wait
Oh, I can’t help but wait
Check it out, uh

[Verse 1]
I see you, you're with him, he ain’t right but you don’t trip
You stand by while he lies then turn right round and forgive
I can’t take to see your face with those tears running down your cheeks
But what can I do? I gotta stay true 'cause deep down I’m still a G

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don’t wanna come between you and your man
Even though I know I treat you better than he can

[Chorus]
Girl, I can’t help but wait 'til you get that with him, it don’t change
Can’t help but wait 'til you see that with me it ain’t the same
Can’t help but wait 'til you see you for what you really are
Baby girl, you are a star and I can’t help but wait

[Verse 2]
It ain't fresh to just let him call the shots
You’re a queen, you should be getting all that someone’s got
You should be rocking the latest in purses, bracelets and watches
You’re worth much more than an occasional
'I love you, I’m thinking of you'

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don’t wanna come between you and your man, no
Even though I know I treat you better than he can

[Chorus]
Girl, I can’t help but wait 'til you get that with him, it don’t change
Can’t help but wait 'til you see that with me it ain’t the same
Can’t help but wait 'til you see you for what you really are
Baby girl, you are a star and I can’t help but wait

[Bridge]
Get it together, you can do better
Seeing is believing and I see what you need so
I’m gon' to play my position, let you catch what you’ve been missing
I'm calling out, girl 'cause

[Chorus]
I can’t help but wait 'til you get that with him, it don’t change
Can’t help but wait 'til you see that with me it ain’t the same
Can’t help but wait 'til you see you for what you really are
Baby girl, you are a star and I can’t help but wait
'Til you get that with him, it don’t change
Can’t help but wait 'til you see that with me it ain’t the same
Can’t help but wait 'til you see you for what you really are
Baby girl, you are a star and I can’t help but wait

[Outro]
Can’t help but wait, no no no no no no
I can’t help but wait, oh
Can’t help but wait, no no no

[Intro: T.I.]
Nigga that's what I thought, I thought
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Yeah pussy nigga that's what I thought, I thought

[Hook: T.I.]
Better go on with that bullshit, we know you ain't doin shit
Walkin round, talkin loud, still ain't got into it yet
We be on that hood shit, you know how we do a bitch
Nigga walk up to a bitch, nigga tell 'em you a bitch
Aye you flaw (you flaw) and you soft (you soft)
Yeah pussy nigga that's what I thought
Aye, aye you flaw (you flaw) and you soft (you soft)
Yeah pussy nigga that's what I thought

[T.I.]
Aye, I was the nigga with the tool out, right in front the schoolhouse
Then the bigger nigga fail assassin, what it do now?
Catch him let him have it, nigga best be glad I cooled down
A fool wit it, hit a nigga hood, make him move out
Yeah, nigga know it ain't no hoein' us
Try Thursday night and Friday shit just go to blowin up
Better catch a cut on that box Chevy go to showin up
Sho' 'nuff we at your do' and on ya ass soon as it open up
Nigga twice as old as us, knew we was 'bout that action too
Up and down the avenue, walkin wit a attitude
Try whoever ready for whatever, it don't matter dude
Best be on your P's and Q's cause never know what Cap'll do
He cap a nigga on the news, he a fool wit it
Nowadays it's different, I don't understand how dude kick it
Computer gooning, makin threats over the internet
Talkin 'bout what you gon' do and you ain't did it yet!

[Hook]

[Mac Boney]
Yeah that's what I thought, and that's what I was thinkin
You know Boney be on point, especially when I'm drinkin
I play a hater smooth to the left side, pimpin off of Westside
And I don't take light to all the square types, I'm 'bout mine
Stomp a nigga ass like I'm tryna make some red wine
Be all on yo' ass like a canine, rewind
I start to bring the fists out, then I brought the pistols out
Runnin through the spot, you done brought the brown niggas out
Finger itchin now, should you get the bigger picture now
I won't allow, a hater to get raw I will air him out
Think about, every single thing that you care about
Stare down the barrel of my bad news carrier
The more the merrier, a group of suckers watch me tear 'em up
The boss said hurry up, while I go crank the McClaren up
You haters scared of us, cause we known to make a cherry bust
You not prepared for us, we done came into yo' area

[Hook]

[Killer Mike]
Killer Killer from the villa, Westside go-rilla
Go realer than these country-ass monkey-ass niggas
These funky-ass niggas, asswipe how I treat 'em
Fuck nigga how I greet 'em, first I beat 'em to they feeter
Might shoot 'em, might leak 'em, funerals I might preach 'em
Right befo' I six feet 'em - you already know the story bruh
Call the coroner, this sucker dead meat
I ain't never scared pussy nigga, I just dead beef
Eat it like Angus, 50 caliber, knock a plug out your anus
If I aim higher leave yo' monkey-ass brainless
Front page constitution, damn I make a fuck nigga famous
Fuck nigga famous!
Now the call the governor, the mayor and the chief of the police
Tell 'em homicide is high ridin, I'm back on they street
Then, call the traffic gangstas and the suckers talkin lip
Tell 'em bang bang bang if a nigga speak on TIP

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Hey
Yeah, uh
Yeah
Lost in the world like Siddhartha while I author these quotes
Cutting hoes like a varsity coach
Caught fire no Larceny, please you gotta pardon these boasts
A lot of niggas pray to god that he choke
Never see the album drop Fall off and be broke
Reminiscing on the hard times, so often he'd hoped to slip his foot in the door
Promise when I made it I’d write my hooks for the poor
But now I'm hella Faded and got my foot to the floor while I'm pushing this Porsche
Seem to be more concerned with how I look in the Source
Staring in the mirror just to see a look of remorse
Take a look at my chain, look at what I've became! (Man)

[Selah Sue]
You never had it easy, I know
But I still remember you
And what we used to say so
I say this' my song for you, my friend
And you can only see that I
Can hardly let things go, no oh yeah

Believed he could change the world, and he did

But that's gone it's been so long cause he's scared
The world ain't fair, and I'm fully aware
When the revolution comes will I stare, or will I ride

When I come home from a hard day's work
And you're waitin' there
Not a care in the world

See the smile awaitin' in the kitchen
Through cookin' and the plates for two
Feel the arms that reach out to hold me
In the evening when the day is through

[Hook]

Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin' though the jasmine in my mind

[Ludacris:]

LUDA!

Now before my nigga Jeezy made this song for the city
Before Wayne put out a milli and then in a week he sold a milli
Before JD threw ten thousand on the floor at Magic City
Before Usher jumped the broom, before he confessed that shit to Chilli
Before DJ Drama dropped the Southern Gangsta Grilly
Before Puff Daddy changed his fucking name to Diddy
Before Janet Jackson went on the tube and showed her titty
I been reppin' for Atlanta and I been reppin' for my city
You could ask Dallas Austin you could ask Rico Wayde
I kept the lights on in Atlanta when Goody and Cash took a break
And you can say that "he this" and you can say that "he that,"
But one thing's for damn sure I put the city on my back
And I ain’t goin' nowhere that movin' money ain't changed em'
But the vaults were too small at the bank so I rearranged em'
These rappers around my way ain't got mo’ money then me
I’m blinded by my own ice but I got mo' money to see
And I ain’t dissin' I’m just spittin’ what I call is the truth!
So catch me ridin' without that thang what you call is the roof!
I got the money in my palms like I carved the Malouf!
Cuz I gotta make myself clear just like a bottle of Goose!
And I can see right through ya
Don’t let the mic fool ya
Say the wrong words and my click might do ya
So before you go runnin' your mouth and say some shit you'll regret
This is just a small verse so that these boys don't forget
I put on
I ball hard on my first album but I ball harder today
Plus, I just opened up a restaurant in the heart of the 'A'
I payed my dues in my city and I’m throwin’ the finger to all the haters
Me and the mayor just bought back the Martin Luther King papers
Now how hard is that shit, how much harder can that get
Hard as the AR will make these niggas do a back-flip
Watch it in Atlanta cuz I’m all over your girl
First nigga with a polo beat I pimped all ova the world
First to put on cash money when they came to the “A”
Shout-out to my nigga Pooh like sh- sh- shawty!
From the goon squad to the shottas
Dope boys to the Rastas
Luda represents this shit from the college park to the Oscars
Put on a tuxedo, get incognito
Got game for ya bitch I shoot it like a torpedo
So before you go runnin' your mouth and say some shit you'll regret
This is just a little verse so that these boys don't forget
I put on
Luda
Let me tell you bout the newest ish that just hit the shelves right
It's called conjure congac
So waddle up yo azz down to the nearest liquor store and get you some

[Chorus: x2]
Apple juice and conjure make em get naked
Me I just drank mines straight with no chaser
Luda get wasted on the every day basis
So tell the bartender bring some conjure cases

Luda get wasted I'm still on my business store
Got a new venture it's sellin out the liquor store
Betta get yo bottle while the bottle still lasting
I plaster  naked women on the bottle that's fashion
X o's blasting
Vso's smashing
All in one glass now it's time for some action
Mix with some oj I called that shit the sunshine
With minutemaid it's a renegade I hope you got the punch line
Conjure and colon yea I named it move over
Cause soon as I jump in the whip I'm passing niccas in the rover
All up on the shoulder
Drive it like a maniac
How low can you go khaled won't you play me that
Mix it with some apple juice I call it lose your mind
But conjure with lime I call that shit a good time
Call myself the mac
I get em all up in the sac
And you know they always say that yak will put em on they bacc

[Chorus: x2]
Apple juice and conjure make em get naked
Me I just drank mines straight with no chaser
Luda get wasted on the every day basis
So tell the bartender bring some conjure cases

[Verse 1]
I had my feet in the water
And right when I was about to get up
Oh, suddenly I caught ya
With a hook line and a sinker
You were swimming at the bottom, yeah
I said why you gon live down there
Well baby you can love up here, on land
And what a difference it makes, you’ll see
What a difference it makes to breathe in
What a difference, it makes it easy to love

[Hook]
The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air’s so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

[Verse 2]
You said you’re feeling ways
That you never could’ve felt under all that pressure
Used to it being dark at night, and you’re kinda afraid of the lights
But you still crack a smile, because it makes you feel alive
And what a difference it makes, you’ll see
What a difference it makes to breathe in
What a difference, it makes it easy to love

[Hook]
The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air’s so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

[Bridge]
Baby I could show you the world
And the seed that’s inside of my heart, baby
Don’t know how you got on land in the first place
Just promise you won’t go back again
It’s better up here you know
Just trying my best to show you
But you started feeling like you’re floating higher and higher
Don’t ever go under no more

[Hook]
The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air’s so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air’s so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
My name, L-U-P that trill nigga
Lean on me like Bill Withers
I’m a shark fin you a seal flipper
No liquor, no weed, no pills nigga
Still I feel I still iller
Cat burglar with the skills nigga
No codeine, old lean, still ODing and I cod I still with you
Feel like a film, you a still picture
No movement, I’m a movie screen
On syrup, no sir, did it all sober like Gucci Mane
From showing off I do refrain
But in the v12 I do be staying
On the low yes I do remain
But I can pull up more autos like 2 T-Pains
2 Kanyes, 2 Lil Waynes, 5 good watches
3 good chainz
Please don’t think that it’s coochie mane
My heart running cold like choo choo trains
Trae Tha Truth and Bun B, they my kinfolk
All my friends fuck a fan from the intro
Been dope since the dog in the trench coat
Now you gotta try and keep them off of this flow
Like I just swept, and I just mopped
And it’s still wet, so you﻿ better not
I’m a macbook, I go anywhere
And you can’t go, you’re a desktop
So, I know exactly where to find y’all
You can find me too, all you gotta do
Is follow all the foot prints that I left in your Pine-Sol

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Good weed, good drank, big money, man
Rolling in something foreign no leather, grippin
I handle my business, so I think I deserve to get throwed
Get throwed, throwed, throwed

[Verse 2: Killa Kyleon]
Leanin' to the left, keep a deuce in my linen, man
Time money, what I just call it, call it minute made
All I do is ball like the ‘Stros off in Minute Maid
So I rock diamonds like the field, that's Minute Maid
Renegade, Em and Jay, real nigga anyway
So I’m gettin' money homeboy that’s plenty paid
I got racks on racks, that’s stacks on stacks
While you broke ass niggas lookin' sad gettin' penny paid
Out rappin' these square ass niggas like burritos
So I see chips, y’all niggas see Cheetos
Ben Franks on me, plus Jacks like Tito
Them other niggas fly, but they ain’t fly as me though
Got wings, hot wings, Superman, where my cape at
On like phones, goddamn I know they hate that
I’m a bad boy so my pockets lookin' Puffy like ?
I rap a lot like J and his son named Jas, I make good music like Kanye jams
So I’m taking off like a runway fast, in that new model, that’s runway cash
SS Chevy, sittin' on 4's
I got a stomachache, I’m shittin' on hoes
For my 20's, still pouring that shit up
Iron Man chest, chain got my shit lit up

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Good weed, good drank, big money, man
Rolling in something foreign no leather, grippin
I handle my business, so I think I deserve to get throwed
Get throwed, throwed, throwed

[Verse 3: Twista]
I got a million flows in my arsenal
Take a listen I will spit at you a bar or 2
I could come with something simple or more instrumental so coming up with the lyrics will be hard to do
So intricate with my rock out can make you catch a ? can make her listen what that nigga doing ? saying damn a nigga flowin
? coming up with a predicate they feeling me i’m a human encyclopedia
I keep it low-key instead of acting like a clown in front of the public cause I dont the like the media
But I come with the piff, and the heat and the shit and crack
My flow arsenic, methamphetamine, cocaine, anthrax

[Hook: Z-Ro]
Good weed, good drank, big money, man
Rolling in something foreign no leather, grippin
I handle my business, so I think I deserve to get throwed
Get throwed, throwed, throwed

[Intro]
Hello? Hello?
Is anybody up here?
Ah, fuck
Where the hell am I?
What, what is this?
Ahh
Welcome
Just a lil' bit
Look bruh

[Chorus]
I’m tryna live life
Fuck where I am

Well, here go the plan
Ay, ay this a toast
To all my people in the room out livin’ it
And this a toast
To nobody in the room forgettin’ it
This shit is sincerely (1, 2, 3, 4) Tory

[Verse 1]
How did we, uh, how did we get here?
Is it cold out? Is it wet there?
Where the fuck are we?
Did we pay for this? Is it jet fare?
Nah, this is full from the heart, this a nigga art
Nigga this, nigga that, this a nigga bar, what?
Right before that nigga start
I like to state, this is where that fake shit depart
I’m Mr. Cool Man, dropped outta school man
The long bread, never caught dead at a school dance
That’s what they call me
But if I had a dollar for all the times that the fuckin’ school shit stalled me
Nigga I’da been rich now with two in the tin house
The view of the penthouse, a slu in the French blouse
The rootings of life is in the booth when I write
I speak my mind and I’m sure that I say the truth to the mic
I’m in my air call yaredals with Mrs. Long Hair
With her lipstick smeared on, her bra strap near gone
That don’t even sound right but your shit sound like
Nah, not even a sound byte
Man it ain’t worth it, man it ain’t worth shit
I made some bad choices 'cause damn, I ain’t perfect
I know when this come out they’ll be like, “Damn you ain’t heard this”
And when your shit come out they’ll be like, “I ain’t heard worse shit”
My back to the bullshit, I’m back to my business
I’m crunchin’ my numbers like I was back to my fitness
And you catchin’ feelings, nigga, I’m catchin’ your bitch ass
'Cause all my niggas fly like we tryna get jetlag, I’m gone
I’m gone
I’m gone
Gone
So gone

[Chorus]
I’m tryna live life
Motherfuck where I am
I’m tryna live life
Well here goes the plan
This shit is sincerely (1, 2, 3, 4) Tory

[Verse 1]
Say that you'll stay a little
Dont say bye-bye tonight
Say you'll be mine
Just a little bit of love
Is worth a moment of your time
Knockin' on your door just a little
It's so cold outside tonight
Let's get a fire burning
Oh, I know I'll keep it burning bright
If you stay, won't you save, save

[Hook]
Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love
Save a little, save a little for me
Won't you save a little
Save a little for me? (oh)

[Verse 2]
This just might hurt a little
But, love hurts sometimes when you do it right
Dont be afraid of a little bit of pain
Pleasure is on the other side
Let down your guard just a little
I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine
Hold on to me, pretty baby
You will see, I can be all you need
If you stay, won't you save, save

[Hook]
Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love
Save a little, save a little for me
Won't you save a little
Save a little for me? (oh)

[Verse 3]
Oh, come on
Make time to live a little
Don't let this moment slip by tonight
You'll never know what you're missing 'til you try
I'll keep you satisfied if you stay
Won't you save, save

[Hook] x2
Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love
Save a little, save a little for me
Won't you save a little
Save a little for me (oh)
(Won't you save a little
Save a little for me?)

How you do it, and don’t ever let me down

[Chorus]
Don’t try to hide it

[Pre-Chorus]
We can drive for miles 'til no one can see but just you and me, oh

How you do it, and don’t ever let me down

[Chorus]

Don’t try to hide it, everybody knows you fly

[Bridge]
Gravity’s blowing up my phone, don’t wanna answer
Them sidewalks calling to me (yeah)
Gravity’s calling my phone, I can’t answer
Ain’t no service way up here girl
We’re twenty-five thousand feet in the air baby
If love was sky, damn right I’m falling
Falling in love, but going up

[Chorus]
Don’t try to hide it, cause I see your wings
If that dress looks fabulous, don’t hide it
It ain’t a secret
Everybody knows you fly, fly, fly
I know you go up, you go up
I wanna go up, take me up
I wanna go up, take me up
Don’t try to hide it, everybody knows you fly

[Outro]

Them racks in my pants look like thigh pads (Thigh pads)
I hit it with the fork, that's my dance (Scur!)
I hit it two times, that's a slow dance (Scur scur!)
I ain't got time for the romance
Cocaine avalanche when I finance
I'ma laugh at ya, I'ma throw a bomb at ya
Since you a crumb snatcher I'ma throw a crumb at ya
I ain't mad at ya, but ya got me bent backwards
I roll another swisher, I don't like to smoke Backwoods
Brick Squad bandana fool, trapped out since grammar school
Brick Squad Atlanta crew, she got a bandana too

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]

Put two swishers together look like I'm blowing on a flute
Yea nigga we up, we ride up on you
Ralph Lauren teddy bear it's not Winnie the Pooh
Yeah nigga we winnin', and spend it on these women
And I ain't playing soccer when I'm kicking it at Lenox

Oh, but I got to (On tonight)
So I'ma change it up a little bit
I'ma do it like this

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
We done been together for a minute
Now it feels funny to be doing somethin' different
But it's all good, me and you finished
She got a ballplayer, but a nigga ain't trippin'
And I ain't saying that he don't love you
But I don't think he love you like I do
But it's okay, it's alright
My BlackBerry's filled with a whole bunch of women
Wasting time
Steady tryna get you back
Get you back in my life
Yeah, you don't care, you don't care
It used to be you that I like, but I'ma do what I like
Tonight, I'm gon' get tipsy
Over twenty-one, all the girls have fun
And watch the ladies jump on me

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Kevin McCall, Bow Wow]
I'm not looking for love
'Cause she's gone-one-one
So tell all the girls that the bottles on us
Get your drink on-on-on

And find a little shawty I like (Yeah)
And, girl, when I'm up in the club (Club), really turnt up (Up)

So where she at? Alright (Leggo)

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
You got the wrong one, if you think I ain't goin' out (Yeah)
You used to be the only girl a nigga would think about (Used to)
I gotta couple of girls on call, I'ma bring 'em out (Ha)
A Magic City stripper, huh? So this what this all about?
I'm in the club doin' my two-step
I done pulled about eight broads already
I'm just gettin' my feet wet (Damn)
But I ain't even knockin' your style (Nah)
See I be here all day tryna count how many girls want Bow (Hold up, one? Two?)
Yeah, I see you on the blogs with your dude and all that (Three? Haha, yeah!)
But little do you know, you makin' yourself look wack (Yeah)
If dude got a problem, better tell him to fall back (What?)

Shit, it's me and Chris in here (Breezy)
So you know it's real thick in here
Better cuff your girl because your bitch in here (Ooh)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Bow Wow, Kevin McCall]

[Verse 1]
First off, say "Peace" to Pine Ridge
Shame at all the damage that the white man wine did
Ghost Dance, Trail of Tears, five million beers a year
And all that other crime did
More peace to the teachers of blind kids
To rebels in small cells keeping their mind big
Say everything's hostile
Suicide bombers and prosperity gospels, emaciated models
With cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils, they got to
Just to stay awake on the catwalk of life where everybody watch you
Straight hair, high heels and a handbag
Crucifixes, racism and a land grab
Katrina, FEMA trailers, human body sandbags
A peace sign and a pants sag
A money toss cause a nine stripper mad dash
A friend request following a hash tag
Now everybody want it like the last laugh
A Michael Jackson jacket or a Daft mask
Purple Jordans or the mixed girl in your math class
Stable is when the Ba'ath had Baghdad
But corporate jets really had to have that gas bad
War and they hope they all fall from the ratatat
Cause that's just more dinosaur for their Cadillacs

[Hook]
Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
Reporting live from the other side what you hear
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
Cause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way

[Verse 2]
And we marvel at the state of Ottoman
Then turn around and treat Ghana like a garbage can
America's a big motherfuckin' garbageman
If you ain't know, you're part and parcel of the problem
You say no you ain't, and I say yes you is
Soon as you find out what planned obsolescence is
You say no they didn't, and I say yes they did
The definition of unnecessary-ness
Manifested
Say that we should protest just to get arrested
That goes against all my hustling ethics
A bunch of jail niggas say it's highly ineffective
Depart from Martin, connect on Malcolm X tip
Insert Baldwin to similar the separate
To me, the truth is more fulfilling than a meth hit
Or finding really fast internet to have some sex with
It's all one song short of a set list
Couple croissants shy of a continental breakfast
Or blowing out your birthday candles just to make a death wish
So absurd, word to Chief Bone Necklace
Down at the Lakota Sioux Casino
A whole culture boiled down to giving you pokeno
I go as left as a heart in the chest
Cause the Horn of Africa is now starving to death

[Hook]
Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
Reporting live from the other side what you hear
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
Cause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way

[Verse 3]
An all-white Los Angeles, the dream of Mr. Chandler
Hope and pray they take Columbus Day up off the calendar
South Central an example of God's gifts
So shout to all the mothers raising babies in SPA 6
The projects of Oakland city, Detroit ghost towns
Monopolies on poverty where D-boy coke bound
It’s parts of Manila like the video for "Thriller"
But the US Embassy is reminiscent of a villa
If poverty is chocolate and privilege vanilla
Then what’s the flavor of the Sunday preacher’s pedophilia?
Cash rules everything around these niggas
As classrooms everywhere around me wither
Hither you can be Mr. Burns or Mr. Smithers
The tyrant or the slave, but nowhere in the middle
Of the extremes of America’s dream
Freud fighting Neo, Freddy Krueger refereeing, now…

[Hook]
Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
Reporting live from the other side what you hear
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
Cause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way

[Outro]
Great American rap resurrect...
Lupe on the check
Westside till I die!

[Verse 1]
Live and die before I get it done, will you decide?
Take my words and turn them into signs that will survive
Because a long time ago, I knew not to deprive
It's safe out there and now you're everywhere, just like the sky
And you are love, you are the love supreme, you are the rise
And when you hear this, you’ll know it’s your jam, it’s your goodbye

[Chorus]
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's going to play my song
To carry me along
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away
To where we all belong

[Verse 2]
We all crossed when we were feeling lost it's just the time
Kateri cried the day her lover died she recognized
Because he gave her a life of real love it's no surprise
The nights are long but the years are short when you're alive
Way back when will never be again, it was a time
It's going to catch you so glad I met you to walk the line

[Chorus]
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's going to play my song
To carry me along
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away
To where we all belong

[Chorus]
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's going to play my song
To carry me along
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away
To where we all belong

[Bridge]
Let me live so when it's time to die even the reaper cries
Let me die so when it's time to leave another sun will rise
I said yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
I said yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

[Chorus]
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's going to play my song
To carry me along
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away
To where we all belong

[Outro]
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone

[Verse]
You niggas gotta be outta your rabbit ass mind
A savage over this cabbage
You really think I'm finna let your faggot ass shine? (No)
Whipping niggas like big body Cadillacs
I'm on my grind, yo, bonafide honcho
I could see through you niggas with cataracts, blindfolds
Matter of fact, I'm so bomb, niggas scatter that
Niggas that, Niggas so rat, Niggas better act pronto
My whole state in a reign, better pack ponchos, y'all know
Shit is real in the ville, you could die slow or quick
Survival's a bitch
But everybody don't meet her, so tuck the nine yo
Wherever y'all roll, niggas allergic to 5-0
God knows I don't put up no facade, no
No fraud, niggas scheming like Sideshow Bob
Keep my eyes so wide, nothing otherwise
Disrespect me, you could watch your mother sigh
From the other side, punk-ass nigga
Jump and get lumped fast, throw you in the trunk
Blast pop while I pump gas
Skunk ass niggas is trash, you need a sponge bath
My niggas will ride all day like a fun pass
That's some New York shit, I'm from the south, though
Don't never disrespect me out yo mouth, ho
I got major clout though, y'all niggas dissin' me is doubtful
You talk shit? Watch your life fade like the outro

[Verse 1]
The crimson tide is flowing through your fingers as you sleep
The promise of a clean regime are promises we keep
Do you like it rough I ask, and are you up to task?
The calicos of Pettibon where cultures come to clash

[Chorus 1]
Several of my best friends wear
The colors of the crown
And Mary wants to build it up
And Sherry wants to tear it all back down, girl
The savior of your light
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses tonight

[Verse 2]
The cross between my former queen
Her legendary stare
The holy tears of Ireland
A lovely cross to bear

[Chorus 2]
Several of my best friends know
The secrets of this town
Mary wants to raise it up
And Sherry wants to spin it all around, girl
The sailors of the night
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses tonight

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus 1]
Several of my best friends wear
The colours of the crown
And Mary wants to fill it up
And Sherry wants to tear it all back down, girl
The saviour of your light
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses

[Outro]
Hey, yeah
We all want the rose you know
I said hey, yeah
Show us love before you go
Say I will, then I say I want to
The story knows that I will never taunt you
Hey, yeah
We all want the rose you know
I said hey, yeah
Show us love before you go
Say I will, then I say I want to
The story knows that I will always haunt you

[Verse 1]
Lucy Rebar
She's a friend of mine
Later she'll go
Back and redefine the line
It's getting longer all the time
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Drinking sunshine
She likes the taste of it
She had a goldmine
But then she wasted it away
You should have seen her yesterday
Oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Sinned along the way
Nothing stops the ache

[Chorus 1]
Sugar daddy
Loves her madly
Cosma Sheiva
Got off, made you a believer
I don't need to
Tender, why do I believe you?
Annie wants a baby now
Annie wants a baby any way she can

[Verse 3]
Missing pieces
She's got a lot of them
Time decreases
I wish I thought of them before
Before it's time to close the store
Oh yeah

[Verse 4]
Distillation
A lonely sycophant
Some liberation
The only seed we ever plant
I want to help you but I can't
No, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Sinned along the way
Nothing stops the ache

[Chorus 2]
Sugar daddy
Loves her madly
Love her, leave her
Got off, made you a believer
Neon soldier
Left her now you've gotten older
Annie wants a baby now
Annie wants a baby any way she can

[Outro]
It's getting longer all the time
It's time to re-design the sign
Oh yeah
Sinned along the way

[Verse 1]
Stiff club, its my nature
Custom love is the nomenclature
Turn down mass confusion
Hit the road 'cause we just keep cruisin'
Double my fun, double my vision
Long hard look at my last decision
Hustle here, hustle there
Hustle me bitch and you best beware

[Refrain]
It's emotional and I told you so
But you had to know, so I told you

[Verse 2]
Soft walk to horizon
One big crash that no one dies in
This is for the folks in Fayetteville
It'll come true if you say it will

[Chorus]
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around

[Refrain]
It's emotional and I told you so
But you had to know so I told you

[Verse 3]
Please don't look right through me
Hurts my heart when you do that to me
Street life out my window
City made breeze gonna stroke my skindow
Just a lot of words on an old brick wall
Rob a lot of banks, got a pedigree scrawl
Put my peg into your square
Run around like we just don't care

[Chorus]
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, Oh yeah!

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Move it ah got to get ya, want to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, going to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, want to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, going to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, want to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, going to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, want to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, going to get you

[Chorus]
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, Oh yeah!

[Outro: Josh Klinghoffer]
When I'm feeling small
And I'm hitting a wall
Wanna feel it all around
When I'm feeling small
And I'm hitting a wall
Wanna feel it all around
(Come on, come on)

[Verse 1]
I'm coming for you 'cause
'Cause I adore you and
I'd like to get inside your mass production
This indecision has
Has got me cringing, well
I can't resist the smell of your seduction

[Pre-Chorus]
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?
Unwrap the package without much persuasion
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?
I want to dance to every days occasion

[Chorus]
This I know, yeah this I know
(Take me home, well take me home)
This I know we're not alone
(Take me home, take me home)

[Verse 2]
When we envision
Lack of division and
The planet does another revolution
The day I blew on you
You said I grew on you
Turns out that we are all the one solution

GO!

[Trumpet Solo]

[Verse 3]
I'm coming at you, well
Year of the cat too and
I like the sound of your articulations
Want to arouse her and
Maybe espouse her, well
She showed me love without the stipulations

[Chorus]
This I know, yeah this I know
(Take me home, well take me home)
This I know we're not alone
(Take me home, take me home)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
I want to lean on you
Get Jan and Dean on you
It's time to sway a little mass perception
I like your cheeky, well
So Mozambiquey and
I think the world could use a clear connection

[Chorus]
This I know, yeah this I know
(Take me home, well take me home)
This I know we're not alone
(Take me home, take me home)

[Chorus]
This I know, yeah this I know
(Take me home, well take me home)
This I know we're not alone
(Take me home, take me home)

[Outro]
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?

[Verse 1]
Junior pimps at the old café
Got to chase those girls around
Westbound, drunk with lots to say
But he never makes a sound

[Verse 2]
Hustlers get what they deserve
But it's always half the gate
Good things come to those who wait
Like an expiration date

[Chorus]
See you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight
I'll lead all your mind games astray
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray

[Verse 3]
Curb your tongue, oh scallywag
Because you've got no flag to wave
Save your breath for the black and white
Every dog will have his day

[Chorus]
See you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight
I'll lead all your mind games astray
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray

Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
See you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight
I'll lead all your mind games astray
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray

[Outro]
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll see you around
Goodbye and hooray
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around
Oh nah, nah, nah, no

[Verse 1]
Start marching
'Cause you think you shot to number one
Counting days and
Skipping your stones into the sun
Over age and under thumb, oh
Does it weigh a ton?
I'll be yours tonight
Living the dream of a meteorite

[Chorus]
Start jumping 'cause
We've got something to say, yeah
Young lovers keep it pumping
In the streets of L.A., yeah

[Verse 2]
Short stroking doesn't fly
Better to go for broke
Watch you smoking Mary Jane
And does it make you choke?
Jumping the fence, riding the rails, oh
Can you take a joke?
I'll be yours today
Living the dream with a capital K

[Chorus]
Start jumping 'cause
We've got something to say, yeah
Young lovers keep it pumping
In the streets of L.A., yeah

[Bridge]
Tell me now, I'll tell you how
Just show me where to send

[Post-Chorus]
Make time for love and your happiness
The Mothers of Invention are the best
We all know and struggle with some loneliness
A tender mess for everyone, I guess
I guess

[Verse 3]
Half blinded
I'm reminded how to find the stairs
Nickel and dimin'
Think it's time to play some musical chairs
Dirty laundry, what a quandary
Ask her if she cares
I'll be yours and more
Better than ever, like never before

[Chorus]
Start jumping 'cause
We've got something to say, yeah
Young lovers keep it pumping
In the streets of L.A

[Post-Chorus]
Make time for love and your happiness
The Mothers of Invention are the best
We all know and struggle with some loneliness
A tender mess for everyone, I guess
I guess

[Verse 4]
Sweet talking
As I'm walking through your part of town
Never again
Will Johnny C. a Love Supreme be found
Is it ever meant to be?
And is it so profound?
Is it you and me?
A billion to one, make history
A history

[Outro]
Said yeah, oh yeah
Said yeah, oh yeah
I said yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
I saw you at the police station
And it breaks my heart to say
Your eyes had wandered off
To something distant, cold and grey
I guess you didn't see it coming
Someone's gotten used to slumming
Dreaming of the golden years
I see you had to change careers
Far away
But we both know its somewhere

[Verse 2]
I saw you on the back page
Of some free press yesterday
The driftwood in your eyes
Said nothing short of love for pay
I know you from another picture
Of someone with the most conviction
We used to read the funny papers
Fool around and pull some capers
Not today
Send a message to her
A message that I'm coming
Coming to pursue her

[Chorus 1]
Down home country
I rest my face on your bed
I've got you ten times over
I'll chase you down 'til you're dead

[Verse 3]
I saw you on a TV station
And it made me want to pray
An empty shell of loveliness
Is now dusted with decay
What happened to the funny paper?
Smiling was your money maker
Someone ought to situate her
Find a way to educate her
All the way
Time to come and find you
You can't hide from me girl
So never mind what I do

[Chorus 2]
Down home country
I rest my face on your bed
I met my soulmate country
And I left it all for your head

[Verse 4]
I saw you in the church yard
And there was no time to exchange
You were getting married
And it felt so very strange
I guess I didn't see it coming
Now I guess it's me who's bumming
Dreaming of the golden years
You and I were mixing tears
Not today
Not for me but someone
I never could get used to
So now I will refuse to

[Outro]
Down home country
I rest my face on your bed
I met my soulmate country
And I left it all for your head
I've got my best foot forward
And I'll chase you down 'til you're dead

[Verse 1]
God is good and fate is great
When it feels so strong it's hard to wait
You never know how it might unfold
Hearts to break and bodies to hold
Time will tell, but it never gets old
Like I told you I'm in for the long, long

[Verse 2]
Had to have been one of those things
That took place in outer space
A match made in heaven
Not a scratch on her face
Angels must have smoked some dust
Singing songs, about "In God We Trust"
Some things slide, but this is a must
Like I told you there's a time for finding out

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ah, people try to tell me what not to do
"You shouldn't make it with a younger girl"
And too many chances for the foot to drop
I tried to tell them that I found a pearl
Well, like I told you be careful what you're asking for

[Chorus]
Hey, sister Brutus
Got a mess of a better half, ow!
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back

[Verse 3]
She was the cutest thing that I ever did see
A drink in her hand and I don't mean tea
She was with a dude, but I just didn't care
I had to find out, these moments are rare
And Stevie says, "All is fair."
Like I told you there is something for everyone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well I guess I never told you some things
That I really, really wanted to say
Did I do everything I could do
Or did the mice just need to play?
Like I told you there's more than meets the eye

[Chorus]
Hey, sister Brutus
Got a mess of a better half, ow!
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back

[Pre-Chorus 3]
I'm not trying to point fingers at you
And I'm not trying to lay any blame
But when it comes to the punishment
Girl, you know how to bring the pain
Like I told you, I'd do it all again

[Chorus]
Hey, sister Brutus
Got a mess of a better half, ow!
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back

[Outro]
Come on
Hey, sister Brutus
There's a fury to the woman's wrath
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back

[Verse 1]
Please don't ask me who
Who you think I am
I could live without that
I'm just a modest man

[Chorus]
Meet me at the corner and, oh
Tell me what to do
'Cause I'm messed up on you
And had I known all that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now
Receding into the forest
I will lay around and wait
And I'll wait for you

[Verse 2]
Please don't ask me where
Where you think I've been
I've been a lot of places
But this could be my win

[Chorus]
Meet me at the corner where I'll
Tell me what to do
'Cause I'm messed up on you
And had I known all that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now
Receding into the forest
I will lay around and wait
And I'll wait for you

[Bridge: Josh Klinghoffer]
I feel so bad, I thought you'd want to know
I feel so bad, I thought you'd want to know
Something I wanna show
I thought you ought to know

[Verse 3]
Please don't say you want
To keep in touch out there
To see you on the corner
That I just can't bear

[Chorus]
Meet me at the corner and, oh
Tell me what to do
'Cause I messed up on you
And had I known all that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now
Receding into the forest
I will lay around and wait

[Outro]
Hey, and I turn
I turn my head when I thought
I saw a sign from the gods
A sign from the gods
That you weren't meant to be mine
And it's fine
Taking it all for a ride
'Til the day when it's gone
Mystified by where it all went wrong
When it's gone
I live and I learn
And I lose and I win
But it's better than ever whenever I'm in
I thank you girl for everywhere that we’ve been

[Verse 1]
You got yours and I've got mine
She got his and she got shine
Under moon and overseas
She got those and we got these

[Chorus 1]
Dance, dance, dance, dance
All night long, yes all night long
Dance, dance, dance, dance
We got strong, yes we got strong
Let's say hello, its safe to go

[Chorus 2]
Dance, dance, dance, dance
All night long, yes all night long
Dance, dance, dance, dance
We got strong, yes we got strong
The light is right, let's play tonight
Let's play

[Post-Chorus 1]
Give yourself a chance to find a way
The holiness of play is here to stay

[Verse 2]
They got this and we got that
He got his and she got fat
You've got mine but I've got yours
I've got love but you've got more

[Chorus 1]
Dance, dance, dance, dance
All night long, yes all night long
Dance, dance, dance, dance
We got strong, yes we got strong
Let's say hello, its safe to go
Let's play

[Post-Chorus 2]
Give yourself a chance to find a way
The holiness of play is here to stay
Tell your mom and dad, it's all okay
The holiness of play is here to stay

[Bridge]
I've got another one
I've got another one
I've got another one
I've got another one
Woah
I've got a better one

[Verse 3]
You got yours and I've got mine
He got his and she got shine
We got all but she got high
Some got hot and they got by

[Chorus 1]
Dance, dance, dance, dance
All night long, yes all night long
Dance, dance, dance, dance
We got strong, yes we got strong
Let's say hello, its safe to go

[Chorus 2]
Dance, dance, dance, dance
All night long, yes all night long
Dance, dance, dance, dance
We got strong, yes we got strong
The light is right, let's play tonight

[Outro]
Let's make the rise
The sun, the prize
Let's play
Let's play

[Verse 1]
Look inside my eyes and tell me you see a warrior
I never felt the feeling of euphoria
Pain forever or prolong the pros and cons of prosperity is strong
Wake up in the morning and I gotta win
Not taking the victory, that's my only sin
And so I send a message to your messenger
A warning shot to let em know I'm serious
I'm ready for a war, when I roar it can break a glass window
The only thing for sure: the perfect way to bend you
On your back even if I gotta slither through the cracks
I can crack every code you deliver, I attack
Every hole where the bomb squad sit it on the tripod
Even if you try hard, he can still die hard
Run but you can't hide: white flags
You can pull em out fast and tell me your last goodbye

[Hook]
I will, I will climb the highest mountain
Before the flood comes
And all my fight is drowning in blood
What I got to lose? What I got to prove?
I guess war is my love

[Verse 2]
Make sure your next move is slick, your best move is nothing
You know I take risk: dark clouds, I love it
Cause I can hide in the mist, hop out
And crush every soldier you're with, so I'm 6 for 6
I'm sick with determination: I'll terminate ya quick
I lead the pack, I follow no rules
I see the traps, I know you're close to
Falling on your face, unload, reload
Hand me another case, explode, explode
The fire of my eyes is waiting on your demise
I know you hope your help is close by

[Hook]
I will, I will climb the highest mountain
Before the flood comes
And all my fight is drowning in blood
What I got to lose? What I got to prove?
I guess war is my love

[Verse 1]
Stop making the eyes at me
I'll stop making the eyes at you
What it is that surprises me
Is that I don't really want you to

[Pre-Chorus]
And your shoulders are frozen (Cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (You're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
And lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

[Chorus]
I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said, I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Well, from 1984

[Verse 2]
I wish you'd stop ignoring me
Because it's sending me to despair
Without a sound, yeah, you're calling me
And I don't think it's very fair

[Pre-Chorus]
That your shoulders are frozen (Cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (You're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
And lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

[Chorus]
I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said, I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Well, from 1984

[Bridge]
And no, there in't no love
No Montagues or Capulets
Just banging tunes and DJ sets and
Dirty dancefloors and dreams of naughtiness

[Chorus]
Well, I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said, I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Said, from 1984

[Tyga]

Man, niggas do anything for these bitches though
Gettin' paper like it's copied, now my dollars' cloned
Twenty thou. overnight for versaci ho
Fat blunts, bitches gettin' Angie Stoned
Damn there's two iguanas in my living room
Thick bitches with big titties, I call 'em balloons
Fuckin with the mask on, and MF doom
Im focusen' emotions, Glock with the room
Beside me killers, you call it careless, I call it wishful
Thinkin' bout' my friends is what pays us in patience

YM champions surrounded by these gold cases
Old faces, new faces they're all abrasive

[Spoken Intro]
Thank you. I believe, uh, I believe firmly that women are always right. Thank you.
Ah, well I should rephrase that. I-uh... don't

[Intro]
Men and women
This song is called "Men and Women"

[Verse 1]
Men are like vows, because they are easily broken, oh, yeah
Women are like cows, because they both have vaginas
Men are like muzzles, because they try to shut you up Oh, yeah
Women are like puzzles, because prior to 1920, neither had the right to vote
Puzzles still don't

[Chorus]
Aah, a man is an eagle, yeah, a woman is a dove
Women can fake orgasms, but men can fake love
Too quiet

[Verse 2]
Women are like fingers and toes, because they're easy to count on
It's cute
Men are like ravens and crows, 'cause they hate using condoms
Fuck it
Women are like "Yahtzee!"s, oh, 'cause I rarely get them
Men are like Nazis, 'cause they both caused the Holocaust
It's true

[Chorus]
Yeah, for every dollar that a man makes, a women makes seventy cents
That doesn't make sense
That's not fair, the man's only left with thirty

[Bridge]
Oh, men and women
Oh, men and women, it's black and white
And an area of grey for hermaphrodites
Oh yeah, oh, yeah, yeah
Male strippers always look like they are applying lotion
And female strippers dancing on the pole
Just look like confused firemen

[Intro: André 3000]
The morning after...

[Spoken Word Verse 1: Toni Hunter]
What time is it? 7:48!
Where, where are my, where are my
Where, where are my panties?
Oh my God, where are my panties?
Damn, where? I don't–
He gon' think I'm a ho
Fuck that, I liked it
I was drunk and it was my birthday anyway
Maybe I should just lay here and let him touch my booty
Mmm, but he don't even know my name

[Spoken Word Verse 2: André 3000]
I know she think I just think she some kind of ho
I don't give a shit about givin' it up on the first night
That's just lettin' me know
She know what she want outta life
What a hell of a way to goddamn wake up
Ooh, that shit was good
Oh, maybe she'd get me some breakfast?
And, she so goddamn sweet, sweet as she wanna be
Ooh, I just lay, ooh, I wanna lay in her hair
You can't fall for it, don't fall for it, Ice Cold (Ice Cold!)
Maybe I just roll over and just lay on her booty, yeah
Naw, no, no
Nah, just lay here and be cool, be cool, Ice Cold (Ice Cold!)
But what if she's the–
What if she, what if she, what if she's the one?

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
And I know I may end up failing, too
But I know you were just like me
With someone disappointed in you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be

[Intro]
"I don't feel there's any point in trying to survive when people don't try to help me."
"When we—we share a community, we should all be engaged and more involved in each other's wellbeing, you know?"

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Now everyday that I walk outta my building
I see homeless people sleeping and chillin' on the steps to the apartment that I live in
I’m not saying everyone’s a victim
But the people that I live with treat ‘em more like villains than actual citizens
I walk past a man laying in his own vomit
He gets his food and his garments by digging in the garbage
I beg your pardon, Mr President, but I'm a resident
And since you've been in office I haven't seen any evidence
Of things changin', we go into Iraq and attack
When we got people on the streets without a roof over their back
We've come to accept the homeless as part of our landscape
The money the government wastes could provide them with a safe place
To eat and sleep, but we cease to see
That our own country is based around war, power and greed
We got families on the street with nowhere to go
And the concrete's the only place they have to call home

[Chorus 1: Don-P]
Nowhere to call your own
Out here in the cold
Wishing you had a home
Feeling you're all alone
Nowhere to call your own
Out here in the cold
Wishing you had a home (Yo)
Feeling all alone

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Now every face tells a different story, a different message
Now how can we judge the book when we don't know the beginning?
We don't know what turned 'em to the bottle, or started injectin'
We just see dirty clothes and another bum beggin'
We don't see the kid who was an addict the second that his mom was pregnant
Or the young girl who was raped and stripped of everything sacred
Who now stands downtown walkin' on the block pacin'
'Cause the only way she knows how to make it is gettin' naked
We don't want to face it, and it being the fact
That the government created the ghetto and gave it crack
To oppress immigrants and blacks, and give 'em more of a setback
Like the last five-hundred-years wasn't enough to accomplish that
Now look at the homeless rate, and tell me to my face that race
Doesn't play an intricate part in your fate in the United States
Now think about your home, and the place that you sleep
And the homeless, who only have the concrete

[Chorus 1: Don-P]
Nowhere to call your own
Out here in the cold
Wishing you had a home
Feeling you're all alone
Nowhere to call your own
Out here in the cold
Wishing you had a home (Yo)
Feeling all alone

[Chorus 2: Macklemore]
Now if you wanna see change then throw your ones in the air
You think the system that we're living in is not fair?
You wanna see change? Then put your ones in the air
Now point it to the ground, 'cause change starts right there
Now if you wanna see change then throw your ones in the air
You think the system that we're living in is not fair?
You wanna see change? Then put your ones in the air
Now point 'em to yourself, 'cause change starts right there
'Cause change starts right there

[Outro: Don-P]
The streets are cold, all alone
In the city
Where you lay your head is your home
What a pity
People pass you by with a glance
Say you're filthy
But they don't know they pain you've been through
No, not really

[Intro: Zimiś & Zwaai]
Never le nkimise
Never le nkimise
Never le nkimise
Le ka zama mara never leloke

[Chorus: Ninja]
I'm indestructible
Gangsta number one
Play now, cry later
The harder they come, the harder they fall! Hosh!
You can't stop me
You can try but you won't survive
Why? 'Cause I'm a motherfuckin' Ninja

Zef side represent
You fucking with the best

[Verse: Ninja + (Yo-Landi)]
Ninja! Die wit kaffir
Ja julle naaiers! Skrik wakker!
(Ten$ion, Ten$ion, T-T-T-T-Ten$ion)
Looks like I'm gonna need my
Matte black Glock nine millimeter
Everyday's like bulletproof vest time
When you rolling through the motherfuckin' zef side
At night we don't stop at the robots
In da day look around 360 degrees like you busting a motherfuckin' doughnut
I'm not even trusting a road block
Our pigs bust caps in the back of your head
Bang! Now you're dead! What you gonna do huh?
Maybe go run tell Zuma (Ha ha ha ha ha ha)
He doesn't give a fuck!
That's why we keep it motherfuckin' gangsta
I'm not scared of you! But you motherfuckin' scared of me
Ja the Ninja has become the enemy

[Chorus: Ninja]
I'm indestructible
Gangsta number one
Play now, cry later
The harder they come, the harder they fall! Hosh!
You can't stop me
You can try but you won't survive
(Why?) 'Cause I'm a motherfuckin' Ninja

[Outro: Ninja]
If you don't like funerals
Don't kick sand in a Ninja's face

[Verse 1]
Every girl that I end up with started on some love shit
Ended on some rough shit, I know that I fucked it
Up, when I did dumb shit, plus we were both rushing
We don't know what love is, no no
So if you're gon' kick me out, then fucking kick me out
I got a condo in Toronto when I get
Lonelier then ever, colder than December
Focus on something better 'cause you ain't around

[Chorus]
If you wonder why I do 'em wrong
Blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex
The reason I'm dying in this song
Blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex

[Verse 2]
I just met this new girl, said her name is Cindy
She could be good for me, I can't let her tempt me
I know what I want and she know too
We gon' do what we gon' do
Baby girl, you're sexy, wanna get
All over your bed sheets, then I'm gone in the morning

[Chorus]
If you wonder why I do 'em wrong
Blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex
The reason I'm dying in this song
Blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex

So go girl, go get it

Now jingal that shit like it's jello

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm claiming it, yeah she's aiming it

[Verse 3]
That girl hella bad, I wanna pop hella tag

Or a landing strip, ain't no need to panic trick
Drop that apple bottom right down on my banana clip
I cock it, aim it and shoot it
So insane how you move it
Love it how you drop it like it's hot
Then take a little time off and just cool it
Cuz it need some time to breathe
Go on and give it a squeeze
Cuz them lips, hips, thighs and even them double Ds be --

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Is that the thanks I get for lovin' you
Is that the thanks I get for tellin' you the truth
You say you wanna know
Where I go when I go
You say you wanna communicate
But you don't hear a word I say

[Chorus]
Is that the thanks I get for loving you

[Verse 2]
Now I'm tired of the looks you give me when I get home late
And I'm getting tired how you forget the lovin things I say
I hold you tight
I treat you right
Now everytime I go out to play
Why you think im leaving

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Now faith and trust, the strongest part of us
That's ok, but you must believe in our love
We can make it better
Put ourselves together and start it again
I hold you tight
You tuck me in at night
I dont ever wanna fight again
I think were both crazy

[Chorus]
But that's the thanks we get for falling in love

[Outro]
We can make it better
We can make it better
Put ourselves together
Start it again
Good evening

We want to just quickly send a nice friendly message to the uh
Fraternal Order of Police in Philadelphia

Here's something nice and friendly
Here's something nice and friendly
Here's something nice and friendly
It goes something like this

Fuck tha police, comin' straight out the underground
A young nigga got it bad cuz I'm brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, cause I ain't the one
For a punk muthafucka with a badge and a gun
To be beaten on, and thrown in jail
We could go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, thinkin' every ... is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo chillin' in a Benz-o
... outta shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To mark off the scene of the slaughter
No control of bread and water
Young niggas...
A young nigga on a warpath
And when I'm finished, yo, there's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dyin in L.A
Yo, I got somethin to say
Fuck tha police
Come on! Off, What?
Fuck tha police
Yeah!
Come on!
Fuck tha police
Yeah

Fuck tha police, comin' straight out the underground
A young nigga got his badge cause I'm brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority

Fuck that shit, cause I ain't the one
For a punk muthafucka with a badge and a gun
To be beaten on, and thrown in jail
We could go toe to toe in the middle of a cell

Fuckin with me cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics

You'd rather see me in the pen
Then me and Lorenzo chilling in a Benz-o
Beat the police outta shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To mark off the scene of the slaughter
No control of bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down and grabbin' his nuts
And on the other hand, a gun they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
Cause they'll slam ya down into the street top
Black police showin' out for the white cop

Yeah, brothas will swarm
On any muthafucka in a blue uniform
Just 'cause we in Washington DC
Punk police are afraid of me
Word!

Punk on a warpath
And when I'm finished, it be a bloodbath
Of cops, dyin' in L.A
Hey yo, we got somethin' to say

Fuck tha police
Come on! Sing that shit loud
Come on!
Come on one more time, here we go, here we go
Come on, one more,  gotta do it
Right now, yeah, check it out

[Zack]
Hey check this out right about now
I wanna introduce a brotha
That came all the way out here from the strong island
New York
And he's one of the fathers of revolutionary music
In our time period
He was a huge influence on us and we wanna bring him out right now
So check it out
We got a man by the name of Chuck D, from Public Enemy
Yeah

[Chuck D]
Wassup, wassup!
Wassup, wassup!
Wassup, wassup!
Wassup, wassup!

[Zack]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

[Chuck D]
I'm with Rage on the stage and I back Zack
Tim on the bass, Tom in your face
We got Brad on the drums, can you get some?
Drummer in the ? can you get some?
Pump pump on my lap at all times
We murder the boom-bap
This is the rage in your ear
Here ye, here ye
The crowd so near me, but you still don't hear me

I got a letter from the government
The other day
I opened and read it
It said they were suckers
They wanted me for the army or whatever
Picture me given' a damn - I said never
Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself
Because they never did
I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute it
Occurred to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been?
They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor
I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me begun to be another one
Public enemy servin' time, they drew the line y'all
To criticize me for some crime
Never the less they could not understand that I'm a black man
And I could never be a veteran
On the strength, the situation's unreal
I got a raw deal, Zack, so I'm lookin' for the steel
Peace y'all

[Zack]
C'mon y'all, give it up for Chuck D!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Zapata's blood
Wasn't spilt in vain
So now the most poor, the most poor
The most poor wage war, wage war
To reclaim their name

Zapata's blood
Wasn't spilt in vain
So now the most poor, the most poor
The most poor wage war, wage war
To reclaim their terrain

Yeah
On January first, 1994
The indigenous farmers of Southern Mexico
Declared war on an unjust
And illegitimate government

Out of the depths of the most wild, the most poor
Came a just arm struggle
For democracy, justice, and liberty
And it won't stop
Until that 65 year old dictatorship
The Partido Revolucionario Institucional
Is buried in the ground
And the people's voice is heard once again
Yeah
So check it out
On January first of 94 they became known as a Zapatista movement
And they have a saying
And I want you all to sing along with me real quick
It goes something like this
It goes:

"Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves"

Sing that shit

"Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves"

Come on!
Yeah!

"Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves"

[Vesre 1: Meek Mill]

Sipping on ciroc on’er then a light switch
Riding thru tha hood wit ma lil bad white chick
Ralph lauren 7 jeans, 9 to 5 night shit
In my 96 impala growlin thru the night shift
I check you like a mic quick, comin out ya damn mouth
Catch you while tha cameras off, show up to ya damn house
Like excuse me MA’AM where such & such ride hard no buckle up
All left hooks right uppercuts treat you like the beat then fuck you up
Im dippin on em wayback, we ain flippin we way strapped
Ma shooters they dont play around they lay you down like wave cap
In tha kitchen wit a 6 duce tryna turn there to a maybach
I whip whip, whip real hard like dale earnhard on the race track
Im in the front but im way back, way back but im in the front
Out shy niggas like ten to one, ???? but there ten of them
Bitch done fucked like ten of dem, oops I mean like ten of us
I don’t wanna ride it ain't tinted up,???? comin thru wit tha fender up
Illuminati want my mind, soul, and body
They ask me would I trade it all for a maseratti
I told him naw he said 100 mil n I said prolli
Plus a phantom, panamera and the bugatti
We can work a deal, I put my mom up on the hill
I go to hell and burn it down
They hatin every time I turn around
Being cocky, I turned it down, now it’s time, jus turn it up
I flame on then burn em up, them niggas act like they learnin up
IM GONE

[Note: cover of Allen Ginsberg's poem of the same name, with lyrical changes]

Lookin' like a bunch of Frat boys at summer camp and shit

Hadda be flashin' like the daily double
Hadda be playin' on TV
Hadda be loud-mouthed on the comedy hour
Hadda be announced over loud speakers
The CIA and the Mafia are in cahoots

It hadda be said in old ladies' language
It hadda be said in American headlines
Kennedy stretched and smiled
And got double-crossed by lowlife goons and agents
Rich bankers with criminal connections
Dope-pushers in CIA working with
Dope-pushers from Cuba working with
Big time syndicate Tampa, Florida

It hadda be said with a big mouth
It hadda be moaned over factory foghorns
It hadda be chattered on car radio news broadcasts
It hadda be screamed in the kitchen
It hadda be yelled in the basement where uncles were fighting
It hadda be howled on the streets by newsboys to bus conductors
Hadda be foghorned into New York harbor
Hadda echo under hard hats
Hadda turn up the volume in the university ballrooms
Hadda be written in library books, footnoted
Hadda be in the headlines of the Times and Le Monde
It hadda be barked over TV
Hadda be heard in side alleys through ballroom doors
It hadda be played on wire services
Hadda be bells ringing
Comedians stopped dead in the middle of a joke in Las Vegas
Hadda be FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover
And Frank Costello syndicate mouthpiece
Meeting in Central Park, New York together weekends
Reported Time magazine
Hadda be the Mafia and the CIA together starting a war on Cuba
Bay of Pigs and poison assassination headlines
Hadda be the dope cops in the Mafia
Sold all that heroin in America
Hadda be the FBI and organized crime working it together in cahoots against the commies
Hadda be ringing on multinational cash registers
World-wide laundry for organized criminal money
Hadda be the CIA and the Mafia and the FBI together
Bigger than Nixon and bigger than war
Hadda be a gorged throat full of murder
Hadda be a mounted ass, a solid mass of rage
Hadda be a red hot head, a scream in the back of the throat
Hadda be in Kissinger's brain
Hadda be in Rockefeller's mouth
Hadda be the central intelligence, the family, offing the agency Mafia
One big set of criminal gangs working together in cahoots
Hitmen, murderers everywhere
Outrage gonna make secret, drunk, brutal, dirty, and rich

On top of a slag heap of prisons
Industrial cancer
Plutonium smog
Garbage cities, grandma's bedsores
Father's resentments
Hadda be the rulers
Wanting law and order
And they got rich on wanting protection for the status quo

Wanted junkies
Wanted Attica
Wanted Kent State
Wanted war in Indochina
Yeah
It hadda be the CIA and the Mafia and the FBI
Multinational capitalists
Strong armed squads
Private detective agencies for the oh so very rich
And their armies, their navies and Air Force bombing planes
Hadda be capitalism
The vortex of this rage
This competition man to man
The horses head in a capitalist's bed
The Cubans' turf in competitions
Hitmen in gang wars across oceans

Bombing Cambodia settled the score
With White House pots and pans
A warning to Mediterranean governments
The secret police have braced for decades
The NKPD and CIA keep each other's secrets
The OGBU and DIA never hit their own
The KGB and the FBI, one mind
Brute force and full of money
One mind, brute force, and full of money
One mind, brute force, and full of money
One mind, brute force, and full of money
One mind, brute force, and full of money
And full of money
And full of money
And full of money

It hadda be rich and they hadda be powerful
They hadda murder in Indonesia five hundred thousand
Hadda murder in Indochina two million
Hadda murder in Czechoslovakia
Hadda murder in Chile
Hadda murder in Russia
And hadda murder in America
That was a poem by Allen Ginsberg called "Hadda Be Playing On The Jukebox." He's a great poet

[Verse 1]
Now baby, I've been thinkin' lately
Beauty in pictures shit, pictures that I've been paintin'
Think you a cutie, baby, your beauty is amazin'
I wanna say somethin' to you but don't wanna be basic
Thinkin' should say hi, or should I let it go
Can make it through the eye, but we've been here before
Girl, do we even try? Baby, I should let you know
When another brother come up, I prolly couldn't let you go
Now shawty, know we young but why are we bein' patient?
Time is of the virtue, why is it bein' wasted?
Wanna be your man, I'm tryna be in the placement
Talkin' 'bout the man who tryna be a replacement, listen
I lay somethin' and tell you I ain't frontin'
Say it to my face when you tell me, you ain't runnin'
And if you straight clean and baby, the pain comin'
All I needin' for you to do is say somethin', please

[Chorus]
Why don’t you say hello, say hello
I see you starin', won't you say hello?
Say hello, say hello
I say to sing because your beautiful, say hello
Your eyes, your hair, your lips, your scent, your smile
Makes me wanna say hello
Your eyes, your hair, your lips, your scent, your smile
Makes me wanna say hello

[Verse 2]
Now baby hurry, we gettin' hasty
Got me feelin' faded from every time that you face me
Got me in the moves 'cause baby that’s where you take me
Right up in the brain, just place me in case we
Feelin' like the race we runnin' is untastely
Feelin' like the change is comin' is come vaguely
Feel my heart race like the F1 blazin'
Thinkin' you the girl, not a next one baby
Now we can keep it cool or we can sit and laugh
But don't waste me and you off the issues of the past
I'm itchin' to sit in a position to be your man
You got me afflicted, I'm really feelin' it's a plan
Listen, I'm feelin' you but the message ain't gettin' through
Shawty, is it true just expressions of lettin' go
'Cause all U wanna do is to tell you and let you know
And all you got to do is say hello

[Chorus]
Why don’t you say hello, say hello
I see you starin', won't you say hello?
Say hello, say hello
I say to sing because your beautiful, say hello
Your eyes, your hair, your lips, your scent, your smile
Makes me wanna say hello
Your eyes, your hair, your lips, your scent, your smile
Makes me wanna say hello

[Bridge]
Take a chance, take a risk
You may find yourself falling in love
Only you hold the keys
To escape from the all the fears of your heart
So say, say something to me
Just say something to me
Just say something to me
Just say something to me
Just say something to me
Just say something to me

[Chorus]
Why don’t you say hello, say hello
I see you starin', won't you say hello?
Say hello, say hello
I say to sing because your beautiful, say hello
Your eyes, your hair, your lips, your scent, your smile
Makes me wanna say hello
Your eyes, your hair, your lips, your scent, your smile
Makes me wanna say hello

[Verse 1]
Take me out tonight
Where there's music and there's people
And they're young and alive
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one anymore
Take me out tonight
Because I want to see people
And I want to see life
Driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home
Because it's not my home, it's their home
And I'm welcome no more

[Chorus]
And if a double-decker bus crashes into us
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten-tonne truck kills the both of us
To die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

[Verse 2]
Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
And in the darkened underpass
I thought "Oh God, my chance has come at last"
But then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask
Take me out tonight
Oh, take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one, la-di-dum, oh, I haven't got one
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
And if a double-decker bus crashes into us
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten-tonne truck kills the both of us
To die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

[Outro]
Oh, there is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out

[Verse 1]
One time ago a crazy dream came to me
I dreamt I was walking to World War Three
I went to the doctor the very next day
To see what kind of words he could say
He said it was a bad dream
"I wouldn’t worry about it none, though
Them old dreams are only in your head"

[Verse 2]
I said “Hold it Doc, a World War passed through my brain”
He said “Nurse, get your pad, the boy’s insane”
He grabbed my arm, I said “Ouch!”
As I landed on the psychiatric couch
He said “Tell me about it”

[Verse 3]
Well, the whole thing started at 3 o’clock fast
It was all over by a quarter past
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
When I peeked out from a manhole cover
Wondering who turned the lights on us

[Verse 4]
Well, I got up and I walked around
Up and down the lonesome town
I stood a-wondering which way to go
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter
And walked on down the road
It was a normal day

[Verse 5]
Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
And I leaned my head and I give a yell
“Give me a string bean, I’m a hungry man”
A shotgun fired, and away I ran
I don’t blame him too much though, he didn't know me

[Verse 6]
Down at the corner by the hot-dog stand
I seen a man
I said “Howdy friend, I guess there’s just us two”
He screamed a bit, and away he flew
Thought I was a Communist

[Verse 7]
Well, I spied me a girl and before she could leave
I said “Let’s go and play Adam and Eve”
I took her by the hand, and my heart was thumping
When she said “Hey man, you crazy or something?
You seen what happened last time they started”

[Verse 8]
Well, I seen me a Cadillac window uptown
There was nobody around
I got into the driver’s seat
And I drove down 42nd Street
In my Cadillac
Good car to drive after a war

[Verse 9]
Well, I remember seeing some ad
So I turned on my Conelrad
But I didn’t pay the Con Ed bill
So the radio didn’t work so well
Turned on my record player —
It was Rock-a-Day Johnny, singing “Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa
Our Love’s A-going to Grow, Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah”

[Verse 10]
I was feeling kind of lonesome and blue
I needed somebody to talk to
So I called up the operator of time
Just to hear a voice of some kind
“When you hear the beep it will be 3 o’clock”
She said that for over an hour
And I hung up

[Verse 11]
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then
Saying "Hey, I’ve been having the same old dreams
But mine was a little different, you see
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me
I didn’t see you around"

[Verse 12]
Well, now time passed and now it seems
Everybody’s having them dreams
Everybody sees their self
Walking around with no one else

[Outro]
"Half of the people can be part right all of the time
And some of the people can be all right part of the time
But all of the people can’t be all right all of the time"
I think Abraham Lincoln said that
“I’ll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours”
I said that

[Intro]
Have you ever been so lonely
That you felt like you were the only one in this world?
Have you ever wanted to play with someone so much
You'd take any one boy or girl?

[Chorus]
Anna Stesia come to me, talk to me, ravish me
Liberate my mind
Tell me what you think of me, praise me, craze me
Out this space and time

[Verse 1]
Between white and black, night and day
Black night seemed like the only way
So I danced
Music late, nothing great
No way to differentiate
I took a chance

[Verse 2]
Gregory looks just like a ghost
And then a beautiful girl the most
Wets her lips to say
"We could live for a little while
If you could just learn to smile
You and I could fly away, fly away"
Yeah...

[Chorus]
Anna Stesia come to me, talk to me, ravish me
Liberate my mind
Tell me what you think of me, praise me, craze me
Out this space and time

[Interlude]
Maybe, maybe, maybe I could learn to love
I mean the right way, I mean the only way
Perhaps  could show me, baby

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Anna Stesia come to me, talk to me, ravish me
Liberate my mind

[Breakdown]
You
Maybe, maybe, maybe I could learn to love
Ah, if I was just closer to somethin'
Closer to your higher self? I don't know
Closer to heaven? Maybe
Closer to God, yeah, closer to God

[Verse 3]
Save me Jesus, I've been a fool
How could I forget you are the rule
You are my God
I am Your child, oh yes I am your child
From now on, I shall be wild
I shall be quick, I shall be strong
I'll tell Your story no matter how long
No matter, no matter, yeah

[Interlude]
We're just a play in your master plan
Now, my Lord, I understand

[Outro]
Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above
Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above
Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above
Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above
Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above
Love is God, God is love

Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above
Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above
Love is God, God is love
Girls and boys love God above

[Verse 1: Mike Love]
Well, East Coast girls are hip
I really dig those styles they wear
And the Southern girls with the way they talk
They knock me out when I'm down there
The Midwest farmer's daughters really make you feel alright
And the Northern girls with the way they kiss
They keep their boyfriends warm at night

[Chorus: Brian Wilson, Group]
I wish they all could be California (Girls)
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California girls

[Verse 2: Mike Love]
The West Coast has the sunshine
And the girls all get so tanned
I dig a French bikini on Hawaii island
Dolls by a palm tree in the sand
I been all around this great big world
And I seen all kinds of girls
Yeah, but I couldn't wait to get back in the states
Back to the cutest girls in the world

[Chorus: Brian Wilson, Group]
I wish they all could be California (Girls)
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California girls

[Outro: Brian Wilson, Group]
I wish they all could be California
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)
I wish they all could be California
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)
I wish they all could be California
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)
I wish they all could be California
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)

[Intro]
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take ya
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go
Jamaica

[Verse 1]
Off the Florida Keys
There's a place called Kokomo
That's where you wanna go
To get away from it all
Bodies in the sand
Tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love
To the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo

[Chorus]
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go
Ooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down in Kokomo
Martinique, that Montserrat mystique

[Verse 2]
We'll put out to sea
We'll perfect our chemistry
By and by we'll defy
A little bit of gravity
Afternoon delight
Cocktails and moonlit nights
That dreamy look in your eye
Give me a tropical contact high
Way down in Kokomo

[Chorus]
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go
Ooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down in Kokomo

Port au Prince, I want to catch a glimpse
Everybody knows a little place like Kokomo
Now if you wanna go to get away from it all
Go down to Kokomo

[Chorus]

[Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go]
Ooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down in Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go
Ooh I wanna take you down to...

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
The Porsche porcelain, the rims are gorgeous
The earth went skrrrt, it got so many horses
An all white chain same color your forces
An ounce of what I smoke cost double your mortgage
So Icy Entertainment I'mma esplain it
Cause when we come in niggas takin' they chain in
I lost my train of thought bitches calling me brainless
I can't buy a burger cause I'm too fucking famous
Put the whip on a donk, give my Chevy a facelift
My 28" Ashantis make it look like a spaceship
The rims look big like the lips of Fantasia
My paint drips wet like activator
You playing with yourself, you a masturbator
You play with So Icy, I have to spray ya
Don't waste all your life being a couch potato
After a while crocodile, see ya later hater
It's Gucci

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
150 Ps got it smelling like weed
In the trap bustin bales down it's time to eat
21 a key, 10 five a half a key, 55 a quarter key nigga come and see a G
Standing on the stove hard, working with them boulders
All these extra grams oughta bring me mo' cheese
Time to count that money man, man I need another hand
Bands after band, tell the fam it's time to eat

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
There's money to be gotten, the crack is running low
I ain't got no purple plug, regular weed moving slow
Hidey Ho, like Robin Hood, robbin in another hood
I chop a barrel, shove it down ya throat and make it understood
Got 'em for a half a brick, eight pounds of purple
80 for the 7 grams, smokin on good purple
Jack fools, make ya strip down to ya butthole
Used to go to school with the foo, but I'm cuckold
Get it how I'm livin, by the gun bullets spittle
AK 40 pumpin bullets like a sickle
I'm just a head crown, hold da jeans all white kicks
Watch 30 grand, like I slang all white bricks
North Memphis niggas when it's good we do bad deals
Hittin forty block, all wop, that's how crack kills
Stacks will rise or somebody gonna pay the piper
I just want the stash don't you make me put you in a diaper (One of them Pampers nigga)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
150 Ps got it smelling like weed
In the trap bustin bales down it's time to eat
21 a key, 10 five a half a key, 55 a quarter key nigga come and see a G
Standing on the stove hard, working with them boulders
All these extra grams oughta bring me mo' cheese
Time to count that money man, man I need another hand
Bands after band, tell the fam it's time to eat

[Intro: Paul McCartney, George Harrison]
One, two, three, four
One, two...  (One, two, three, four)

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

[Verse 2]
Should five percent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

[Bridge]
If you drive a car, car, I'll tax the street
If you try to sit, sit, I'll tax your seat
If you get too cold, cold, I'll tax the heat
If you take a walk, walk, I'll tax your feet
Taxman

[Guitar Solo: Paul McCartney]

[Refrain]
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

[Verse 3]
Don't ask me what I want it for
(Haha, Mr. Wilson)
If you don't want to pay some more
(Haha, Mr. Heath)
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

[Verse 4]
Now my advice for those who die
(Taxman!)
Declare the pennies on your eyes
(Taxman!)
Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman

[Outro]
And you're working for no one but me (Taxman!)

[Verse 1]
Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying

[Verse 2]
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining

[Verse 3]
That you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being

[Solo]

[Verse 4]
That love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing

[Verse 5]
That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing

[Verse 6]
But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living

[Verse 7]
Or play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning

[Outro]
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning

[Intro: John Lennon, Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
Ah
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid

[Chorus 1: Paul McCartney]
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

[Chorus 2: Paul McCartney and (Lennon, McCartney & Harrison)]
Lovely Rita, meter maid
May I inquire discreetly (Lovely Rita)
When are you free to take some tea with me? (Lovely Rita maid! Ahh-ah-ah)
Rita!

[Piano Solo]

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home, I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two

[Chorus 3: Paul McCartney]
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you?
Give us a wink and make me think of you

[Outro: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, & George Harrison and (Paul McCartney)]
Lovely Rita meter maid (Lovely meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid (Rita meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid (Oh Lovely Rita, meter meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da

You so fine I'm so sad that you feelin so wooooozy

[Intro]
Ooh, let's go!

[Verse 1]
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

[Verse 2]
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out

[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

[Bridge]
Hey
Oh, take it
Bite the dust, hey
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust, ow
Another one bites the dust, hey hey
Another one bites the dust, hey-eh-eh
Ooh

[Verse 3]
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

[Outro]
Shoot out
Ay-yeah
Alright

[Verse 1]
She keeps Moët et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake," she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Khrushchev and Kennedy (Ooh, ooh)
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline (Ooh, ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

[Chorus]
She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Pa-pa-pa-pa) Anytime
Ooh
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

[Verse 2]
To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah (Ooh, ooh)
(Killer, killer, she's a killer queen)
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined

[Pre-Chorus]
Perfume came naturally from Paris (Naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

[Chorus]
She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Pa-pa-pa-pa)
Anytime

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussycat (Ooh)
Then momentarily out of action (Ooh)
Temporarily out of gas (Ta-taaa)
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's out to get you

[Chorus]
She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam (Pa-pa-pa-ra)
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
Ooh
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
You wanna try

[Verse 1]
You make me feel like I'm losing my virginity
The first time, every time when you're touching me
I make you bloom like a flower that you never seen
Under the sun, we are one buzzing energy
Let's pollinate to create a family tree
This evolution with you comes naturally
Some call it science (Science), we call it chemistry
This is the story of the birds and the bees

[Pre-Chorus]
And even when seasons change
Our love still stays the same

[Chorus]
You give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me the hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat

[Verse 2]
I've flown a million miles, just to find a magic seed
A white flower, with the power to bring life to me
You're so exotic, get my whole body fluttering
Constantly craving for a taste of your sticky sweet
Always on the brink of a heart attack
You keep me alive and keep me coming back
I see the sun rise in your eyes, your eyes
We've got a future full of blue skies, blue skies

[Pre-Chorus]
And even when seasons change
Our love still stays the same

[Chorus]
You give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat

[Bridge]
You love me, you love me
Never love me not, not, oh no
When we're in a perfect harmony
You make me sound like, like a symphony, oh

[Chorus]
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Oh, spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat

[Outro]
Ah ah (Oh, hey, yeah), hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah (Oh, hey, yeah), hummingbird heartbeat
Ah ah, hummingbird heartbeat, beat, beat, beat

And I still ain't got no time for her
These hoes be actin' up, these niggas be actin' tough

[Verse 2: Wale]
These hoes be acting up, see, me, I don't practice much
Gold albums from the word of mouth
Gold bottles in the back of us
These jawns be broke as fuck, too uptight, they won't open up
She got her arms folded even on the phone
I'm like, "What the fuck is she here for?"
These hoes be actin' up, these niggas keep wifin' them
Please homie, got me cracking up
Never spent one more than a night with her
These hoes be a fucking joke
They'll never say a nigga didn't warn you though
Cause you can hit my phone like four in the morning
And I be like, "Hah, I told you so", work

[Chorus: Rico Love]
These hoes be actin' up, these hoes be acting up

[Verse 1]
His eyes bloodshot red
I watched him as he took a fifth of Henny to the head in memory of his brother
Reminiscin' on them playing Sega with each other
He was hurtin', I could see it, plenty tears, no Kleenex
I stood by his side because that was my homie
Gave him a hug, some of his brother's blood got on me
Clinchin' his fist on some angry shit
Stood up, sat back down on the curb and asked me who they be hangin' with
I wasn't sure, so I gave him no answer
But I was sure that he had him a blammer and wanted war
Revenge, what do you say to a good friend
That just lost it and grabbin' choppers out of the closet?
I tried my best to make him re-neg
But he was like, "My nig, this feelin' is more than personal"
I stood down
He hopped in a four-door Honda Accord
Before he bent the block, he said, "K-Dot...
"...You wouldn't understand"

[Chorus]
(These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, oh woe)
Or, at least, try to understand
(The city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s
The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, oh woe)

[Verse 2]
Corners become monuments for the dead
Candles on the pavement, postcard read
Rest in peace, the yellow tape blockin' off the streets
A baby mama yellin' at the police
But you don't understand
You figure that we're just a bunch of niggas but the picture here's a story untold
See, this wasn't in our plans
Babies from the late '80s wasn't born crazy, we was raised that way
Put that Malcom X book down, then raise that K
Complete chaos when we off X pills and St. Ides
Look the devil in the face, from a sane eye
Cast the spell on you like Akeelah and the Bee
Every killer in the street is a teen with a corrupted mind
Substance, time, is no longer an issue
We don't have it, so pass the tissue
Then close the casket, kiss the momma when you can
And tell her you understand, but you don't understand

[Chorus]
(These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, oh woe)
And, hopefully, you'll understand
(The city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s
The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, oh woe)

[Verse 3]
He came back fifteen minutes later
He said, "Dot, I went on one, do me this favor
Dump these guns in a safe place, let nobody see you
This as critical as it gets, my nigga, I need you"
I said, "Alright, so what happened?"
"Seen a few niggas slippin' and I just started clappin'
I didn't care who I was hittin'"
That's wild shit, but anyway, I got you
I love you nigga make sure you hit me up by tomorrow
I woke up the next mornin' with a cold
Allergies got me sneezin' and wipin' my nose when it was leaking
Checked the medicine cabinet, lookin' for some DayQuil
But all I seen was some Aspirin, s'just my luck
I got up, went to Rite-Aid
Hopin' that the pharmacy department had the right aid
I bought it and left
Walked to the parking lot, that's when I seen the faces of death
Said they was lookin' for my man, with a chopper in they hand
Prayin' it would jam, but you don't understand

[Chorus]
(These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, oh woe)
I'm tellin' you, do you understand?
(The city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s)
Huh? Do you understand?
(The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, oh woe)

[Outro]
It's like
It's a revolving door
That I've been a part of
My whole life
Fucked up, right?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Listen, girl
You so bad and you single, what's this I hear?
We ain't met yet, my name Drake
And I'ma take the world over, this my year
This I swear
Had my share of women that I been with
I'm young, can ya blame me?
I know you feel like a lot of things off-limits
At least let me describe what it can be
Be faithful, I'll do that
Nah, really, baby girl, I'll do that
'Cause everybody break up when they cake up
We can be the couple that'll never go through that
Yeah and if we ever fallin' off
I swear I'll remind you that
That we're not who they are
Now all I really gotta do is find you
Where you at?

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Drake]
From the east to the west
Scream for me if you my number one lady
Take a lead from the rest
You can go fast, speed it up for me, baby
I'm a G, what's next
One night with me would drive you crazy
One night with me would drive you crazy
When it starts, are you ready?
Take your marks and get steady
You know that it's about to get heavy
But she's a rider, a rider, my yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, she my
My yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, be my
My yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, she my
My yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, she my

[Verse 2: Drake]
Tell me how to locate you
I know satellites all breakthrough
But they don't ever lead me straight to
And I gotta arrive 'fore somebody take you
Know there's someone you don't mean a lot to
And he would hate to know that I got you
I even got a speech in my head
That I write and recite at the moment I spot you
"Hey there, your name is?
I like that, it suits ya
I'm young, but different
I'm not what you're used to at all"
If we stop at the same red light
I'ma celebrate the fact that I found you, girl
And I'ma ride for you too, as soon as it turn green
Wanna hear from my ladies all around the world
Where you at?

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Drake]
From the east to the west
Scream for me if you my number one lady
Take a lead from the rest
You can go fast, speed it up for me, baby
I'm a G, what's next
One night with me would drive you crazy
One night with me would drive you crazy
When it starts, are you ready?
Take your marks and get steady
You know that it's about to get heavy
But she's a rider, a rider, my yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, she my
My yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, be my
My yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, she my
My yamaha mama
Ayy, ayy, she my

"Boyfriend" remix
Yeah
2 Chainz

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Uh, nine times out of ten, you a ten
If your schedule open, I'll pencil you in
Ight, wiggle it in, get with your friend
Laugh now, cry later, hope you ticklish then
Let's figure it out, I figured it out
Shawty so thick she put a dent in my couch
And dent in my wallet, I'm diggin' her probably
I told her, "Let's kick it" (Kick it), karate (Damn)
Got a black belt on, Versace (Uh)
Wanna get my eat on, Hibachi
2 Chainz on with a pinky ring (Ring)
If I'm your boyfriend, you can have anything
(Anything?) Anything (Anything?) Everything

(Hello) You hear that wedding ring? (Yeah)
And if you answer, then we settling

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'd like to be everything you want
Hey, girl, let me talk to you

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
I'd keep you on my arm, girl, you'd never be alone
And I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go, I'd never let you go

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Youngin' gettin' money, all these honeys say they love me
Buddha belly, how I'm lucky, girls be rubbin' on my tummy
I can be your man, get you everything you need
Have you ever had a Rollie, Stewart Weitzman on your feet?
And you can be my queen, couple thousand on the jeans
'Cause I'm down to do some spendin' on the women of my dreams
Marvin told us we should get it on, right here in the restaurant
Ain't no point in waitin', baby, I can get you what you want
Leprechaun gold, got leprechaun gold
And I came out hot like I was steppin' on coals
But I never got cold, keepin' extra long dough
For a rainy day, need a vacation, name a place, we can go
Where I'm tryna take you, we gon' need a boat
Independent raps, yeah, my life is like the Beatles though
Invest a big check to make sure you get fresh
'Cause if I was your boyfriend, I'd treat you like a princess (Princess)

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'd like to be, everything you want
Hey, girl, let me talk to you

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Asher Roth]
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
I'd keep you on my arm, girl, you'd never be alone
And I can be a gentleman, anything you want (Asher Roth)
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go (Yeah), never let you go

[Verse 3: Asher Roth]
And we can be like Selena and Biebs
Wild and free, a couple disobedient teens
Sneakin' out to meet around like two o'clock in the eve
Paparazzi ain't a problem, we just hide on the beach
Girl, you hotter than me, let's go fly overseas
Or just slide up in the closet, never findin' the key
'Cause seven minutes in heaven ain't enough when we're together
Kisses to the forehead, when I slide my hands to second (Uh)
Wait a second, smilies in a text
I kinda be interested, I'm lyin', girl, I'm obsessed
Stylish sun dresses, legs in jean shorts
Please pick me, love is a team sport (Uh)
I'll be your boyfriend, jokes and pillow talk
Lay around in our undies, chill, play Tony Hawk
Dance slow in the dark, come roll with the Roth
'Cause when that falsetto hits, y'all gonna know who to call
So, JB

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'd like to be, everything you want
Hey, girl, let me talk to you

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
I'd keep you on my arm girl, you'd never be alone
And I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go, I'd never let you go

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
So give me a chance, 'cause you're all I need, girl
Spend a week with your boy, I'll be callin' you my girlfriend
If I was your man (If I was your man), I'd never leave you, girl
I just wanna love and treat you right

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go (Woo, yeah)
I'd keep you on my arm, girl, you'd never be alone (Never be alone)
And I can be a gentleman (A gentleman), anything you want
If I was your boyfriend (Boyfriend)
I'd never let you go (If I was your boyfriend), never let you go

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
(Uh) Na-na-na (Yeah), na-na-na (Uh), na-na-na, yeah, girl
(Uh) Na-na-na (Yeah), na-na-na, yeah, if I was your boyfriend
(Uh) Na-na-na (Yeah), na-na-na (Uh), na-na-na, hey
(Uh) Na-na-na (Yeah), na-na-na, hey, if I was your boyfriend

[Verse 1: Brian Wilson]
Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong?

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

[Verse 2: Brian Wilson]
Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
After having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
But happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never-ending
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?

[Bridge: Mike Love, Brian Wilson, Carl Wilson]
Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray, it might come true
Oh, baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
Oh, we could be married (Oh, we could be married)
And then we'd be happy (And then we'd be happy)
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
But wouldn't it be nice?

[Outro: Mike Love]
Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby
Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby
Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby

[Intro]
I said, who's that girl there?
I wonder what went wrong so that she had to roam the streets
She don't do major credit cards, I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate
And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance, I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offences
And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
'Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
I said, he's a scumbag, don't you know?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 1]
Although you're trying not to listen
Avert your eyes and staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
"I'm sorry, love, I'll have to turn you down"
And oh, he must be up to summat
What are the chances? Sure it's more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
And start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause they said it changes when the sun goes down
Yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here, around here

[Verse 2]
Look, here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mr. Inconspicuous?
And he don't even have to say owt
She's in the stance ready to get picked up
Bet she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily-clad beneath the clear night sky
It don't stop in the winter, no

[Chorus]
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Well, they said it changes when the sun goes down
Over the river, going out of town
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here, around here, oh

[Outro]
And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance, I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a nasty plan
I hope you're not involved at all

[Verse 1]
We'll ask if we can have six in
If not we'll have to have two
Well, you're coming up at our end aren't you?
So I'll get one with you
Won't he let us have six in?
Especially not with the food
He could have just told us no, though
He didn't have to be rude
You see her with the green dress?
She talked to me at the bar
Well, how come it's already two-pound fifty?
We've only gone about a yard
Didn't you see she were gorgeous?
She were beyond belief
But this lad at the side drinking his Smirnoff Ice
Came and paid for her Tropical Reef

[Chorus]
And I'm sitting, going backwards
And I didn't want to leave
I said, "It's High Green, mate
Via Hillsborough, please"

[Verse 2]
Well, how funny were that sketch earlier
Up near that taxi rank?
Oh no, you would have missed it
Think it were when you went to the bank
These two lads squaring up, proper shouting
'Bout who were next in the queue
The kind of thing that'd seem so silly
But not when they've both had a few
Well, calm down, temper, temper
You shouldn't get so annoyed
Well, you're acting like a silly little boy
Oh, they wanted to be men
And do some fighting in the street
He said, "No surrender
No chance of retreat"

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And so why are they in the taxi?
'Cause I didn't want to leave
I said, "It's High Green, mate
Via Hillsborough, please!"

[Verse 3]
Drunken plots hatched to jump it
Ask around, "Are you sure?"
Went for it, but the red light was showing
And red light indicates doors are secure

[Verse 1]
She's got everything she needs
She's an artist, she don't look back
She's got everything she needs
She's an artist, she don't look back
She can take the dark out of the nighttime
And paint the daytime black

[Verse 2]
You will start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees
You will start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole
Down upon your knees

[Verse 3]
She never stumbles
She's got no place to fall
She never stumbles
She's got no place to fall
She's nobody's child
The Law can't touch her at all

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 4]
She wears an Egyptian ring
It sparkles before she speaks
She wears an Egyptian ring
It sparkles before she speaks
She's a hypnotist collector
You are a walking antique

[Verse 5]
Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes
Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes
For Halloween buy her a trumpet
And for Christmas get her a drum

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Shawty cooler than fan, but her man not me
Got a real hot mouth, she a stone cold freak
10 girls in my suite, brought sand to the beach
Got a nigga from the country, call two times a week
I'm in a red Maserati with some snow white seats
And when I skeet I try to aim it at her snow white teeth
Red bottoms on the wood, watchin' the Hawks play the Heat
Brought the whole Bricksquad, 10 grand every seat
6 ounces and a liter that's a dirty sweet tea
I'mma put this game on bad bitch that I meet
I'm a zone 6 king and my jeans got wings
I'm a rich girl's fantasy, a poor girl's dream

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Hold up stop the track, let's get some'n understanded
I'm servin' softball, I pitch underhanded
Your girlfriend said she like me but I'm too demandin'
Bitch shut the fuck up and take these 10 bricks to Kansas
My stash done got so big that I can't rubber band it
My plug speakin' Spanish, I can't understand it
So stop the track my nigga let's get some understandin'
Bitch shut the fuck up and take these 10 bricks to Kansas

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Now I can't dance a lick but look my diamonds dancin'
Rap or trap my nigga I'mma take my chances
I had a couple jugs didn't go down how I planned it
I guess I fronted him too much, he couldn't handle it
You disrespect the Squad then you get reprimanded
Blowin' kush in her hair, she smokin' second handed
I got the whole pack sold 'fo the pack landed
Chicken bags in the trap, call it hand to handin'
And you ain't gotta shop with me that's fine and dandy
Two ways, four nines call it Georgia candy
Cookin' dope in Louboutin cuz I'm kinda fancy
I met your bitch at the bar, got her two shots of Brandy

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 3: Jim Jones]
Hold up wait, let me explain
Half my niggas move ki's of 'caine
Jewish lawyers what we've retained
In my car's where she give brain
Bought the _____ of Dorthy
Yellow road, sellin' bricks
Big face, yellow wrist, drop top, hello bitch
Cut the shit, make sure that we see eye to eye
We got them birds and they don't fly up in the sky
Bitch, and you gon' take this trip to Kansas
And you gon' get them bricks of dandruff
I wash the money like it's Head & Shoulders
I watch the money like a deadly cobra
And hit my phone once you got the bricks
You hit the road you better hold it if you gotta piss

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 1]
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain
I got a head full of ideas that are drivin' me insane
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

[Verse 2]
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
Well, he hands you a nickel, he hands you a dime
He asks you with a grin if you're having a good time
Then he fines you every time you slam the door
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more

[Verse 3]
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Pa no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Pa no more
Well, he puts his cigar out in your face just for kicks
His bedroom window, it is made out of bricks
The National Guard stands around his door
Ah, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Pa no more

[Verse 4]
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Ma no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Ma no more
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law
Everybody says she's the brains behind Pa
She's 68, but she says she's 54
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Ma no more

[Verse 5]
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well, I try my best to be just like I am
But everybody wants you to be just like them
They say "Sing while you slave" and I just get bored
Ah, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

[Verse 1]
My love she speaks like silence
Without ideals or violence
She doesn't have to say she's faithful
Yet she's true, like ice, like fire

[Verse 2]
People carry roses
And make promises by the hours
My love she laughs like the flowers
Valentines can't buy her

[Verse 3]
In the dime stores and bus stations
People talk of situations
Read books, repeat quotations
Draw conclusions on the wall

[Verse 4]
Some speak of the future
My love she speaks softly
She knows there's no success like failure
And that failure's no success at all

[Verse 5]
The cloak and dagger dangles
Madams light the candles
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Even a pawn must hold a grudge

[Verse 6]
Statues made of match sticks
Crumble into one another
My love winks, she does not bother
She knows too much to argue or to judge

[Verse 7]
The bridge at midnight trembles
The country doctor rambles
Bankers' nieces seek perfection
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring

[Verse 8]
The wind howls like a hammer
The night blows rainy
My love she's like some raven
At my window with a broken wing

[Verse 1]
Ain't it hard to stumble
And land in some funny lagoon?
Ain't it hard to stumble
And land in some muddy lagoon?
Especially when it's nine below zero
And three o'clock in the afternoon

[Verse 2]
Ain't gonna hang no picture
Ain't gonna hang no picture frame
Ain't gonna hang no picture
Or hang no picture frame
Well, I might look like Robert Ford
But I feel just like a'Jesse James

[Verse 3]
And I wish I was
On some Australian mountain range
Oh, I wish I was
On some Australian mountain range
I got no reason to be there, but I
Imagine it would be some kinda change

[Verse 4]
I got my dark sunglasses
I got for good luck my black tooth
I got my dark sunglasses
I'm carrying my good luck, my black tooth
Don't ask me nothin' about nothin'
I just might tell you the truth

[Verse 5]
I got a woman in Jackson
Oh, I ain't gonna say her name
I got a woman in Jackson
I ain't gonna say her name
She's a brown-skin woman
But I love her just the same

[Verse 1]
Well, I wake up in the morning, there's frogs inside my socks
Your mama, she's hidin' inside the icebox
Your daddy walks in wearin' a Napoleon Bonaparte mask
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, do you have to ask?

[Verse 2]
Well, I go to pet your monkey, I get a face full of claws
I ask who's in the fireplace and you tell me Santa Claus
The milkman comes in, he's wearing a derby hat
And you ask why I don't live here
Honey, how come you have to ask me that?

[Verse 3]
Well, I asked for somethin' to eat, I'm hungry as a hog
So I get brown rice, seaweed and a dirty hot dog
I've got a hole where my stomach disappeared
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, I gotta' think you're really weird

[Verse 4]
Your grandpa's cane, it turns into a sword
Your grandma prays to pictures that are pasted on a board
Everything inside my pockets your uncle steals
And you ask why I don't live here
Honey, I can't believe that you're for real

[Verse 5]
There's fistfights in the kitchen, they're enough to make me cry
Little mailman comes in, even he's got to take a side
Even the butler, he's got something to prove
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, how come you don't move?

[Intro: Bob Dylan & Tom Wilson]
I was riding on the Mayflower
When I thought I spied some land

[*Laughter*]
Start again
Wait a minute now
Okay, take two

[Verse 1]
I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land
I yelled for Captain Arab, I have you understand
Who came running to the deck, said, "Boys, forget the whale
Look on over yonder, cut the engines, change the sail
Haul on the bowline", we sang that melody
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea

[Verse 2]
"I think I'll call it America," I said as we hit land
I took a deep breath, I fell down, I could not stand
Captain Arab he started writing up some deeds
He said, "Let's set up a fort and start buyin' a place with beads"
Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon
He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons

[Verse 3]
Ah, me I busted out, don't even ask me how
I went to get some help, I walked by a Guernsey cow
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums
Where people carried signs around sayin', "Ban the bums"
I jumped right into line sayin' "I hope that I'm not late"
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight

[Verse 4]
I went into a restaurant looking for the cook
I told him I was the editor of a famous etiquette book
The waitress he was handsome, he wore a powder blue cape
I ordered some Suzette, I said "could you please make that Crepe?"
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boilin' fat
Food was flyin' everywhere, I left without my hat

[Verse 5]
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy but I went into a bank
To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France
Who invited me to her house, I went but she had a friend
Who knocked me out and robbed my boots and I was on the street again

[Verse 6]
Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display
I said, "Could you help me out, I got some friends down the way"
"The man says, "Get out of here, I'll tear you limb from limb"
I said, "You know they refused Jesus, too", he said, "You're not Him
Get out of here before I break your bones, I ain't your pop"
I decided to have him arrested and I went lookin' for a cop

[Verse 7]
I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab
I went out the other door, this Englishman said, "Fab"
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand and a chariot that stood
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood
I ran right through the front door like a hobo sailor does
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was

[Verse 8]
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh
He gave me his card, he said, "Call me if they die"
I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet
A pay phone was ringing and it just about blew my mind
When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line

[Verse 9]
Well, by this time I's fed up at tryin' to make a stab
At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab
I decided to flip a coin like either heads or tails
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail
So I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip
It came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so I made it back to the ship

[Verse 10]
Well, I got back and took the parking ticket off the mast
I was ripping it to shreds when this coastguard boat went past
They asked me my name and I said, "Captain Kidd"
They believed me but they wanted to know what exactly that I did
I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed
They let me go right away, they were very paranoid

[Verse 11]
Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail
But the funniest thing was when I was leavin' the bay
I saw three ships sailin' there, were all heading my way
I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck
He said his name was Columbus, I just said, "Good luck"

[Chorus]
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

[Verse 1]
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me, I am branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And my ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming

[Chorus]
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

[Verse 2]
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
To be wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancin' spell my way
I promise to go under it

[Chorus]
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

[Verse 3]
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing

[Chorus]
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

[Verse 4]
And take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

[Chorus]
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Bitch better have my money
Don't test me, motherfucker I study
And wifey keep tellin' me the pills gon' kill me
Fuckin' up my sperm count and she want children
Back on my bullshit, I'm back on my bullshit
I'm a dead man walkin', follow my footprints
If you scared go to church, I shoot at the pulpit
My girl pussy sweeter than a whatchamacallit
I ain't worried bout 'em, I say "Hi hater"
I throw you off the top of a skyscraper
5Boro, we go Bozo
And I'd rather be po' before a Popo
Don't come down here if you ain't from down here
Fuck around and get stuck like gum down here
And that vest won't help cause I'm aimin' at your scalp
And all my underwear say Ralph

[Chorus]
And all I do is skate and smoke and rap and fuck
Skate and smoke and rap
But all I do is skate and smoke and rap and fuck
Skate and smoke and rap
Now let me see ya kickflip, kickflip, kickflip, kickflip, kickflip, kickflip
I got your bitch dick whipped, dick whipped, dick whipped, dick whipped, dick whipped, dick whipped

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I got a call and nigga it's my sweetie
Five bowls in her mouth spell Weezy
Yeah, monkey on the dick
And I ain't no magician so I never love a trick
Man light up that Swisher, punch him in the kisser
Kidnap his mom, and fuck her like Stifflers
Tatted everywhere man these hoes love a nigga
Glock with the magazine do you want the cover nigga huh?
Um, I'm in that Trukfit
I'm in that pussy and I beat it like a drumstick
Talk stupid and I'll put you on a milk carton
Boy I just shoot you in the back, handicapped parkin'
Yeah, my gun "pow" like Gasol
If you don't want beef milk the cow cowboy
Yeah, and tell them snitches I'm rat poison, pussy motherfucker

[Chorus]
And all I do is skate and smoke and rap and fuck
Skate and smoke and rap
But all I do is skate and smoke and rap and fuck
Skate and smoke and rap
Now let me see ya kickflip, kickflip, kickflip, kickflip, kickflip, kickflip
I got your bitch dick whipped, dick whipped, dick whipped, dick whipped, dick whipped, dick whipped

[Verse 1]
Of war and peace the truth just twists it's curfew gull it glides
Upon four-legged forest clouds, the cowboy angel rides
With his candle lit into the sun though its glow is waxed in black
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden

[Verse 2]
The lamppost stands with folded arms, its iron claws attached
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail though it shadows metal badge
All and all can only fall with a crashing but meaningless blow
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden

[Verse 3]
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand and then complains
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf but still remains
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay at ships with tattooed sails
Heading for the Gates of Eden

[Verse 4]
With a time-rusted compass blade, Aladdin and his lamp
Sits with Utopian hermit monks side saddle on the Golden Calf
And on their promises of paradise you will not hear a laugh
All except inside the Gates of Eden

[Verse 5]
Relationships of ownership, they whisper in the wings
To those condemned to act accordingly and wait for succeeding kings
And I try to harmonize with songs the lonesome sparrow sings
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden

[Verse 6]
The motorcycle Black Madonna two-wheeled gypsy queen
And her silver-studded phantom cause the gray flannel dwarf to scream
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey who pick up on his bread crumb sins
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden

[Verse 7]
The kingdoms of experience in the precious winds they rot
While paupers change possessions, each one wishing for what the other has got
And the princess and the prince discuss what's real and what is not
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden

[Verse 8]
The foreign sun, it squints upon a bed that is never mine
As friends and other strangers from their fates try to resign
Leaving men wholly totally free to do anything they wish to do but die
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden

[Verse 9]
At dawn my lover comes to me and tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse into the ditch of what each one means
At times I think there are no words but these to tell what's true
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden

[Verse 1]
Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon
There is no sense in trying

[Verse 2]
Pointed threats they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fools gold mouthpiece the hollow horn
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
That he not busy being born
Is busy dying

[Verse 3]
Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan, but unlike before
You discover that you'd just be one more
Person crying

[Chorus]
So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing

[Verse 4]
As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons, great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all
Except hatred

[Verse 5]
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Make everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without lookin' too far
That not much is really sacred

[Verse 6]
While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the President of the United States
Sometimes must have to stand naked

[Chorus]
And though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it

[Verse 7]
Advertising signs that con
You into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime, life outside goes on
All around you

[Verse 8]
You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks they really found you

[Verse 9]
A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
That it is not he, or she, or them, or it
That you belong to

[Chorus]
But though the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to

[Verse 10]
For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destiny
Speak jealously of them that are free
Do what they do just to be
Nothing more than something they invest in

[Verse 11]
While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And say "God bless him"

[Verse 12]
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole
That he's in

[Chorus]
But I mean no harm, nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him

[Verse 13]
Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares
Propaganda, all is phony

[Verse 14]
While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon 'em naturally
Life sometimes must get lonely

[Verse 15]
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say, okay, I've had enough
What else can you show me?

[Chorus]
And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only

[Verse 1]
You must leave now
Take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun

[Chorus]
Look out, the saints are coming through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

[Verse 2]
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets

[Chorus]
The sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

[Verse 3]
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
Your empty-handed armies are all going home
Your lover who just walked out the door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor

[Chorus]
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

[Verse 4]
Leave your stepping stones behind
There's something that calls for you
Forget the dead you've left
They will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore

[Chorus]
Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

[Intro]
And now with the following collection of ghoulish sounds

[Verse]
Fuck Pusha T and anybody that love him
His head up his ass, I'ma have to headbutt him
Gut him, Lil Tunechi shit, weak stomach
It's me, LT, like when you heat butter
Old pussy in a can, red is the flag
Fuck with me wrong, I'll put your head in your hands
There'd be blood everywhere, I got Bloods everywhere
I'm a alien, I hope you ain't the Prince of Bel-Air
That's real nigga talk, these niggas speechless
Cut off his arm and leg like I charge for my features
Hammer on my side like I work in construction
Your bitch hit that head so hard, we get concussions
Niggas can't see me, not even a glimpse
Too many banana clips, I feel like chimps
South Beach bitch and her tan line stupid
You could find me on Collins like Bootsy
I ain't on no fuck shit, I be on that Trukfit
Your girl do tongue tricks, and you sweeter than one-six
All I ever see is Ben Franklin face
I chase the bank, I don't bank with Chase
You fuckin' with some niggas that'll murk y'all
Nigga, you softer than a motherfuckin' Nerf ball—bird call!
Brrrr! What happened to that boy?
He was talkin' shit, we put a clap into that boy
Tunechi!

[Intro: Nipsey Hussle]
Turn that beat up for me
Really everything, like the headphones
Yeah, yeah, a little bit louder
No punch, you know that mean that we workin' hard

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, young rich nigga shit, pops was an immigrant
Lifestyle ill legit, but know I own businesses
Started out the trunk, ended up at the dealership
All gold Rollie, black face no blemishes
Legend in my city cause I grind so vigorous
If I show my face west of Texas, that's a big event
Gotta pay me twenty cents just to hear me vent
I'm really out here on some shit, you should take a flick
Ballin' on my own ten toes, so the difference is
I call shots never ask for permission, man
I got a lot of big plans in my vision and
I ain't failed yet, 'bout a dollar hell yes
I'm a problem-filled test, it's only getting worse
I swear I'm getting money, I just hope you gettin' yours
I'm killin' niggas solo so you know I'm gettin' more
Now that young Gambino on the chorus, go

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
This is for that real shit, this is for that East side
This is for my bad girls, this is for them good guys
This is for my grandma, this is for that Westside
This is for them niggas talkin' shit on a website
Damn I feel good, you ain't feelin' nothin'
This is for my niggas who be livin' dime a dozen
Bino got that good shit, Nipsey got them aces
On some young rich shit, Kennedys with black faces

[Break: Childish Gambino]
Yeah, black faces
My Rollie so racist, all black faces
Obama on that million dollar bill, black faces
Yeah, nigga, black faces
Look, yo I got this
Yo, turn, turn it up a little
Ay, here we go, okay

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
League of my own, swag Geena Davis
Only rapper make 100k on your playlist
Niggas talk on Twitter, but in life, they don't say shit
My Rollie so racist, all black faces
We the new facet, kill 'em like Jason
Grind in my sleep man a nigga need braces
Wonder what you feelin' like, used to be the nervous type
They ain't mention Bino? Man that shit must be on purpose, right?
Hostile, nigga my style
Kind of flow to paint a picture, Norman Rockwell
I don't eat pasta, everything is low-carb
I don't fly coach now, say I fly Goyard
Leave a face covered in that coast guard
Metaphor Mozart, all we do is tell 'em the truth
M Fox to my people on some family ties
Magazines got black faces when somebody dies
I mean look at Donna Summers, she was tryin' to survive
People wrestle over petty cash
When we should be really cryin' over that one percent
Like we tipped a milk glass
Fuck y'all, I'ma let my grandkids ball
Look to the future, these dudes so last week
See me stuntin' so Conde Nasty
Me and Nipsey on some grown shit, no rent
Own shit, so Jim Crow shit, black faces

[Outro: Childish Gambino]
Ay, nigga, black faces
Black faces
That's royalty, nigga

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Your boyfriends an alcoholic
But Gucci's a reefer chiefer
Your girlfriends a penis eater
I swear she's a people pleaser
Im pourin up two liters
And riding in two seaters
Sippin on mojitos
One mill on my wife beater
Party with white people
I really don't like people
Party tonight
But you must go with the right people
Bigger than life nigga
K with a knife nigga
And he might end his own life
Found out I'm fucking his wife,Leave her
Guccis accustomed to death
Sex with no feelings attatched
Pulled to my bachelor pad
Rari the top is detatched
Bumping
And humping
And jumping
In something
Damn yo girl is one hell of a woman
Telling me something
Then telling me nothing
Got to think about something
To keep me from cumming

[Hook]
I bought out them racks out to play(aye mane)
I bought them racks out today (Say mane)
I put them racks in your face (aye mane)
I brought them racks out the safe (say mane)
I bought out them racks out to play (aye mane)
I bought them racks out today(say mane)
I put them racks in your face (aye mane)
I brought them racks out the safe (say mane)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Ok my crib look like Bay Watch
Dont quit your day job
She walking with nothing
But she leaving my tank top
Lately I've been seeing more champagne than raindrops
B.I.G the only thing thats missing is puff saying ,"we can't stop"
Rolling with jigga but I'm not a nets fan
Everything green round me
Like I'm a jets fan
If its green then I burn it
This weed and cash I deserve it
My car and girl both german
Said she's a ____
I need a surgeon
I be running to the money
And I feel like I'm racing a turtle,Squirtle
Boy I got so rich so early
Swear I gave my money a curfew
Now all of ya niggas alert you
Because I got the bitch you can't tame
Drunk off pussy and champagne
And you ain't gonna do a damn thang

[Hook]
I bought out them racks out to play(aye mane)
I bought them racks out today (Say mane)
I put them racks in your face (aye mane)
I brought them racks out the safe (say mane)
I bought out them racks out to play (aye mane)
I bought them racks out today(say mane)
I put them racks in your face (aye mane)

[Intro]
And I’ll be on my way
And I’ll be on my way
And I’ll be on my way
And I’ll be on my way
Look, I’ma give you a tip
Never let nobody tell you what you can be
They told me I couldn’t
But I bet they told Obama he couldn’t be the president either

[Chorus]
On my way, on my way
World tour, with 10.000 miles per hour
Tryna make it to the top from the bottom
On my way, on my way, on my way
I see them fans, everywhere I go I spot ‘em
They believed in me, so you know I got 'em
On my way

[Verse 1 : Meek Mill]
I look in the mirror, what do I see?
Like the letter after a, I'm all I could be
Bein’ a winner, that’s all I could see
Give me the ball, bet I score on all of they D
Wanted it bad, I was writing and falling asleep
I had to split it 50/50 not all in the streets, whether rapping'
Or trappin', whether trappin' or rappin'
I was making it happen with dreams of making it rappin'
I was makin’ some magic like some magician and rabbit
My position was heavy but I insisted I had it
I insisted I’d get it for me, my mom and my sister
Grindin’ and winnin’ and it’s just the beginnin’

[Chorus]
On my way, on my way
World tour, with 10.000 miles per hour
Tryna make it to the top from the bottom
On my way, on my way, on my way
I see them fans, everywhere I go I spot ‘em
They believed in me, so you know I got 'em
On my way

[Verse 2]
I had a basketball dream they deflated
I wasn’t good as Michael Jordan so they faded
God dealt me my hand and I displayed it
Gave me a king of diamonds, I flip me an ace of spades
And that’s blackjack and bed scraps
Soon to be the great as I sat back and tack that
Did it for the haters
Man, I did it like the Lakers
Kobe and Phil Jackson
I’m independent as ever, them labels is still askin’
I didn’t believe they believed in me
'Cause where I’m from they all believed with me
So this the song I say
Yea, I be on my way
Yea, I be

[Chorus]
On my way, on my way
World tour, with 10.000 miles per hour
Tryna make it to the top from the bottom
On my way, on my way, on my way
I see them fans, everywhere I go I spot ‘em
They believed in me, so you know I got 'em
On my way

[Outro]
On my way
On my way
On my way
On my way
On my way
On my way
On my way

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Well, it take money to make money
That's why I make money
Need some today so
I'mma go take they money
Flip money, I weigh money
Hundred grand, that's play money
Counterfeit, that's fake money
Lob city, that's Blake money
Cash money, that's Drake money
Broke niggas, they hate money
Rappers they get slave money
Gucci Mane, I save money
Gamble in your face money
Brick squad we taste money
Gold diggers they chase money
Rich niggas we waste money!
Street smart, I know money
Y'all niggas got no money
Still making that slow money
Ha, cause you owe money
Pimp niggas get ho money
Scared money don't make money
Like Big Meech, I blow money
Y'all niggas is so funny

[Hook]
It take money to make money
Anytime you ready x3
Wanna race nigga, wanna gamble?
Anytime you ready x3
Like shopping, like travel?
Anytime you ready x3
I could hit the club and go crazy
Anytime you ready x3

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Got money I said it
Brick Squad we ain't petty
I'm so big headed, hundred eighty grand on my Chevy
Go broke, won't let it
Swag sick can't help it
Financial goals I met it
It's a drummer track an it's epic
I'm a hood nigga with credit
Bills, I don't sweat it
Cash I go get it
But these broke niggas pathetic
Rich niggas go get it
Bitch niggas get jealous
Drop money, I'm careless
It's all mine, I'm selfish
Your money home, you left it
Broke nigga can't help it
Ball hard, I'm wealthy
Thank God I'm healthy
From the jet way to the jet-ski
Aren't you glad you met me?
Haters said they don't like me
But they gotta respect me!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Birdman]
G nigga, about paper
Them niggas getting the vapor

And them other niggas be fakers
High roller we shot callin'
Real nigga we been ballin'
Pussy nigga catch a sideline and
Watching niggas who both balling
Hustle nigga my own line
Pussy niggas get flat-line
Money nigga, get all the time
New whip, for the sunshine

Cooking up them quarter, niggas
Stepping up them order niggas
Getting it out that water nigga
Rich game, my rich gang nigga
Feline and my wrist game nigga
Weed niggas getting rich game
We the niggas flipping the wrist game
Key nigga, we move blood
Get it from the G blood
Uptown, we feed bloods
Feed a nigga a dope plug

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Isn't she lovely?
Isn't she wonderful?
Isn't she precious?
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love, we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely? Made from love

[Verse 2]
Isn't she pretty?
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us, He's given life to one
But isn't she lovely? Made from love

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 3]
Isn't she lovely?
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie, it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
That's so very lovely, made from love

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
Drumma, Drumma, Drumma Boy

[Verse 1]
It's 1:30 in the morning, you're blowing up my phone telling me to come over
And you say you really need me to come closer, babe and handle your body
Girl, I'm right here to hold you down, slow it down and speed it up
And girl, I want you to scream, baby, come put your hair down for me

[Chorus]
I-I-I know, I know, every time I'm with her, every time I'm with
Every time I'm with her, she gon' break me off
I can't wait to get her (Yeah), I can't wait to get (Yeah)
I know when I get her, I'ma break her off
I just can't wait for you (Oh baby, c'mon, baby)
I can't wait for you, yeah, girl (Haha)
Baby, please I need it more and more
Baby, one more time
One more time (Uh-huh)

[Verse 2]
Girl, you know you the shit tonight
You gon' get this dick tonight, that's right, know you're mine
And you can give me all of that lick tonight
I'm kissing both of your lips tonight
A nigga going harder, harder, I know you a bad girl
And I need it and that lame nigga just beat it (Ha)
Two girls off the bed, that's two stains, Versace, they body
Fuck ‘em with the Rollie on and two chains, wait (Haha)

[Chorus]
I know every time I'm with her, every time I'm with
Every time I'm with her, she gon' break me off
I can't wait to get her (Yeah), I can't wait to get (Yeah)
I know when I get her, I'ma break her off
I just can't wait for you (Oh baby, c'mon, baby)
I can't wait for you, yeah, girl (Haha)
Baby, please I need it more and more
Baby, one more time
One more time

[Intro]
With everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going
But you think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror don't blow it

[Verse 1]
Look at me when I'm talking to you
You looking at me but I'm looking through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself, I'm looking at the..

[Hook: Bruno Mars]
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again

[Verse 2]
I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you re all alone
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong
I see that guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne, I'm lookin at the..

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Looking at me now I can see my past
Damn I look just like my _______ dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in the broken mirror
I see my mama smile that's a blessing
I see the change, I see the message
And no message coulda been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the..

[Interlude]
MJ taught me that
Take 'em to Mars, man

[Hook]

[Outro]
Hey B.P., looks like I did take 'em to Mars this time?

So why are we, talking to each other again...

[Verse 1]
You bite through the big wall
The big wall bites back
You sit there and sulk
You sit there and bawl
You look so pretty
When you're on your knees
Disinfected
And eager to please

[Chorus]
Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes but we're already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change

[Verse 2]
Each time it comes
It eats me alive
I try to behave
But it eats me alive
So I declare a holiday
Fall asleep, drift away

[Chorus]
Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes but we're already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change

[Chorus]
Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes but we're already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change

[Verse 1]
Jesus Christ, girl
What are people going to think?
When I show up to one of several funerals
I've attended for Grandpa this week
With you with me
But someone's got to help me dig
Someone's got to help me dig

[Verse 2]
Jesus Christ, girl
It hasn't been long so it seems
Since I was picking out an island and a tomb for you
At the Hollywood Cemetery
You kiss on me
But we should let this dead guy sleep
We should let this dead guy sleep

[Verse 3]
Jesus Christ, girl
I laid up for hours in a daze
Retracing the expanse of your American back
With Adderall and weed in my veins
You came, I think?
Because the marble made my cheeks look pink
But I'm unsure of so many things

[Outro]
Someone's got to help me dig
Someone's got to help me dig
Someone's got to help me dig

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg, Chris Parnell & Both]
Lazy Sunday
Slept right through my alarm
Activate Siri and say “Call Parns"
Who dis?
It’s me, man
Yo Samberg, kick facts
Tonight is the night
Broadway? Sister Act
The show’s not ’til later
Let’s murk some brunch
I know a cute French place
Meet me outside Crunch
My core is ripped
That workout was trill
Man I can almost taste those mimosas for real
The menu changes at three
We’d better start jammin’
I love to have brunch more than McAdams loves Channing

[Break: Chris Parnell]
Dubstep

[Verse 2: Andy Samberg, Chris Parnell & Both]
Two fifty-nine
Made it on a technicality
Eggs benedict
No yolk
Less calories
The plating is cray
I detect sage butter
How you wanna pay Chris?
Go Dutch, motherfucker!

[Hook: Andy Samberg, Chris Parnell & Both]
Go to Sister Act
Like a pistol whack
Buck wild in the streets
Off a sixer pack
We go to Sister Act
Like we got racks on racks
‘Cause once you buy ‘em
You can’t give your tickets back

[Spoken Interlude: Andy Samberg & Chris Parnell]
Yo, hold up, hold up
Hey, yo, Chris, we’re gonna have to hit ‘em with some new shit for 2012, my dude
So why don’t you drop it on ‘em like right now?
Allow me to reintroduce myself

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg, Chris Parnell & Both]
My name is Parns
P to the A-arns
Scooping bargains
Up at all the Pottery Barns
Young Sandwich and I came to catch reck
Still waitin’ on a fucking YouTube check
Don’t mess with Magnolia ’cause the line’s too long
Plus it bumps with my cleanse
Now back to the song
Yo, peep the marquee
They some funny ass nuns
We got ninety-nine problems
But this sitch ain’t one
Sneak in the flask
Filled with sweet Vermouth
We take more shots in the theater
Than John Wilkes Booth
Flip-up binocs
‘Cause we’re cultural mavens
Lights dim and we scream out
That’s so Raven

[Hook: Andy Samberg, Chris Parnell & Both]
Go to Sister Act
Like a pistol whack
All up in the theater
Like aristocrats
We gonna Sister Act
Like we got racks on racks
‘Cause once you buy ‘em
You can’t give your tickets back

[Outro: Andy Samberg & Chris Parnell]
On these New York streets
I honed my fake rap penmanship
That’s how it began
And that’s how I’ma finish it

[Hook]
Super duper stupid cocky
My wrist super duper rocky
Rocky like the rocky mountains
Make it rain, water fountains
Damn she got a stupid body
I just popped a super Molly
Twin ferraris got em thinking
I'm down with illuminati
Say your sorry, beg your pardon
Gucci Til I pack The Garden
Riding foreign, rocking Ralph Lauren
Call me Liberaci
Louie keychain belt and wallet
Shoes and jeans and hat Versace
Gucci back so who can stop me
I can't lie I'm super cocky

[Verse 1]
I got money in every pocket in my cargos
Pull up in a largo
Call me Gucci Fargo
Sold so many deuces I should have a bar code
Pj to Las Vegas won a half a mil in Cosmo
Fucked so many bitches, dipped my dick in rolls gold
Suicide doors on the Rolls and you know that I had to go get the brain glow
They say Gucci Mane so hard but shawty loco
Never rapped the same flow
And never hit the same ho
Heard your nigga getting some money but he lame tho
Your boyfriends a rainbow
An egg beaters my logo
I'm the ruthless
I'm the crucialist
I put diamonds all in my crucifix
Y'all know how I do this shit
Treat an RnB bitch like a groupie bitch

[Hook]
Super duper stupid cocky
My wrist super duper rocky
Rocky like the rocky mountains
Make it rain, water fountains
Damn she got a stupid body
I just popped a super Molly
Twin ferraris got em thinking
I'm down with illuminati
Say your sorry, beg your pardon
Gucci til I pack The Garden
Riding foreign, rocking Ralph Lauren

Gucci mane so who can stop me
I can't lie I'm super cocky

Gucci mane make super profit
Your girlfriend is jocky jocky

Bitches think I'm feedin' pigeons
Cuz I keep that bread around me
Ten bitches and only me
This girl is getting some head beside me
First I let her drive the car
Then I let her ride the star
On a bra don't own a bra
I swear that girl a porno star
Yo boyfriend got a loan-a-car
Ménage a troise, I'm up to par
Stay stupid fresh I'm extra sharp
I swear he cross dress grandmama
On your break lets go to lunch
She ate my balls like crunchy munch
Pull out clean I love to stunt
The backs the front, the fronts the trunk
Buy a pint, spike the punch
Smoked out the pound, we crown the blunt
Scram if you ain't serving grams
I still got what them junkies want

[Hook]
Super duper stupid cocky
My wrist super duper rocky
Rocky like the rocky mountains
Make it rain, water fountains
Damn she got a stupid body

Say your sorry, beg your pardon
Gucci til I pack The Garden
Riding foreign, rocking Ralph Lauren
Call me Liberaci
Louie keychain, belt, & wallet
Shoes and jeans and hat Versace
Gucci mane so who can stop me
I can't lie I'm super cocky

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill

In case of accidents, he always took his mum
He's the all American, bullet-headed, Saxon mother's son
All the children sing

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor, and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Bridge 1]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

[Verse 2]
I look at the world, and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake, we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge 2]
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

[Verse 3]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
(I look) Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps

Slipped up, slipped in
Hey man, what the hell you doing?
Raw dog is a never

Heard her whisper, "don't worry, I'm safe"
Didn't matter 'cause it's already too late
I was lost in the sauce, dead wrong
And I ain't stopping now
Parlaying in the bush again
Didn't think about what I was putting in it

[Chorus: Usher & Girl]
Go on and hit it

Spend a hundred grand at any given time of day
So much cash on me you think I robbed an armored truck
Smoking kush in front of 12 like we don't give a fuck
Want some trap shit you came to the right place
In the Peach State trafficking these Cali grapes
I'm a king I swear that I should play for Sacramento
Put a hit on you your ho all and the fucking kin too
Treat my cars just like my house put curtains on all my window
So much codeine in this sprite it look like Pepto-Bismol
Miss me with all of that gossip and that innuendo
They say my diamond chain is ill they say that I'm a sicko
Made a hundred thousand dollars standing at the Citgo
You bust it up and you see crystals sparkling in the middle
And I never stopped jugging nigga cause I'm not a quitter
And when I hit the club I hit it with a bunch of killers

[Hook:]
My mama gave birth to a trap boy, trap boy
Then trap boy then turned into a dope man, dope man

[Verse 2:]
Fuck with me you know I got the Charlie Sheen
Hundread pints of purple that's a lot of lean
Got 2000 pounds of swag like I cut the grass

So many bank rolls in my robin pockets bout to bust
Walking trought the mall and I'm smelling like a pound of kush
I got thirty grand on me and a .40 Cal
I'm in a Louie V store signing autographs
My plug text me said it just came
I text him back my nigga I'll be on my way
I'm selling more scale than Spondivits

And ain't no broke niggas coming to my house
Got that white girl call her Amy Winehouse
Old school '74 costs a townhouse
Better bring 'em pounds before I bring the 9 out

[Hook:]

Why you tryna stunt, you need to play your own position
Never gave a fuck, yeah, nothin' 'bout me changed
Still roll up them blunts, got diamonds in my chain, haha

Here she comes, there she goes, never chasin' after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low

[Verse 2: Disiz]
Yeah, douze ans de pe-ra, soldé par un echec
Y'a encore quelques mois frérot c'était la hass
Six mois de travail, lucide une vision claire
Je viens de refaire 12 ans après, mon buzz de 12 ans en arrière
Pas besoin de manager faut juste une calculatrice
L'industrie du disque c'est un peu le bal des actrices
Disiz noir et blanc, j'ai le flow oreo
J'ai connu les bas les hauts, je vis toujours dans le barillot
Et le son est loud ! Je suis un gars rodé, un baroudeur
T'as pas idée il pu ma soeur, l'argent à trop d'odeur
Y a trop d'auteur sans trop d'hauteur
Le premier sans H
Je vais y allé meme si je suis hallé
Le dernier avec H
Ma vision du black money, celle de X
Fuck ta black card
Kill me softly comme Robert Taflag
Bail de west, Mac Milli petit feuj de Philly
En featuring avec Siz-di
Muslim avant d’être hustler

[Refrain 2: Disiz]
J'aime quand mon pe-ra sonne lourd, sonne lourd
Les gros balourd, sont plus glamour, aux feux de l'amour, de l'amour
Quelques potes, des bonnes idées par la lumière téléguidée
Fuck les biff en concert on kiff frère t'as pas idée

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here she comes, there she goes, never chasin' after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Argh
I'ma get that Grammy soon, fuck your magazine
Jordan gonna hand me shoes, still fuck your magazine
Hammer team in that pack with me, hear the Jerm beat banging, with a glass of lean
When I went to every high school class would be tryna fuck the female faculty
I'm a crazy little fucker, think my head done ran away
I experiment with drugs but I won't ever fuck with yay'
I just made a million dollars, still I think I'm underpaid
Fuck with me? Kid no way, when you meet me, bitch stand up straight
Pump out raps, yeah, I got raps, tryna talk shit, what you think about that?
For the pesos, getting bank roll, I'ma lay low, chill, 'til I let that stack

[Refrain 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, people lie, numbers won't, keep me high, drugs is close
Roll one up, pour a cup, watch the world go up in smoke

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here she comes, there she goes, never chasin' after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low

[Verse 1: Brian Wilson]
I know perfectly well I'm not where I should be
I've been very aware you've been patient with me
Every time we break up you, bring back your love to me
And after all I've done to you, how can it be

[Chorus: Brian Wilson, Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston, Mike Love, Carl Wilson, Dennis Wilson]
You still believe in me

[Verse 2: Brian Wilson]
I try hard to be more what you want me to be
But I can't help how I act when you're not here with me
I try hard to be strong, but sometimes, I fail myself
And after all I've promised you so faithfully

[Chorus: Brian Wilson, Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston, Mike Love, Carl Wilson, Dennis Wilson]
You still believe in me

[Outro: Brian Wilson]
I wanna cry
Cry
Ah
Ah
Ah

[Verse: MC Paul Barman + MF DOOM]
I'm old school
This mic is my ProTool
I'm three apples high
I live in a toadstool like a smurf
Everyone at birth is given x-ray specs
But they under-use them to undress the opposite sex
Holy guacamole!
Let's get this rap cash
'Cause art right now is on some slap-dash, claptrap-crap trash
Leave me here
Save yourself!
Okay—pass me your wallet, I'll send help
Mmm—now who drank the last brew?
They turned off my cell again
The bill was way past due
Gosh, tell a friend
But don't let 'em gas you
It's all just hogwash
Now back to the castle
Where's that?
Parts unknown
When I'm home the seeds throw darts at the throne
No tart taste to the ho cakes
No jakes
And first place
In the go-cart race goes to—
No brakes! Teach peace to the babies
We're all the same
At least for the ho's sake
Stepped on an undisclosed rake
Catch a nose-ache...
Y'all flows is fake
Yodle-eh-hee-who wants to be my protege?
Me—me too!
So parrot-back it
I'm an underlined caret bracket
Greater than or equal to
But greater than four stars
Greater than straight-A report cards
Greater than poor sports in divorce courts or sports bars
What's your mission?
Making hundreds
Shaking blunders in this self (inaudible) taking on fun-filled until—
Done—chill
It ain't all about the dollar bill
You could be dead broke and be a scholar still
That's true
What question should I ask you?
Uh—"What type of ill-type of tricks do the mask do?"
Okay; what type of ill-type of ill tricks do the mask do?
The face plate remove and I give chicks tattoos
But then they can see your face!
I make 'em look the other way
I almost caught a case off that same shit the other day
In Grady's truck is where I first got lucky
In the 80s, now I make the ladies say, "Yucky!" like Sandy
Bollocks, that old mustache is bull-snot
On your bald spot
Now that's what I call hot!

[Intro]
I'mma just go... And then we'll figure it out from there
They say form follows function
And if you just function properly things will form themselves
Yeah, that's kind of what it is
So on that note... America's most

[Verse 1]
First off gotta send shout outs to my niggas
Then shout outs to my inner demon that be creepin' around my temple
Ready to set me off like Vivica or make me cross like a crucifix
Or the legs on a Buddhist sitter deep in thought
Thinking as deep as the sea of salt
And they sink in the same sea that we walk
Not that we Jesus, we just don't wait until it thaws
But you can hold my hand like applause, pause
With no homophobia involved
Now if I would've said that you can hold my balls like VFW Halls
That would've been the call, but naw
You can't see in ours, but we can see in yours
You can't see in ours cause ours is Kingdom Hall
Yeah, just like that, we just let it roll, you know?
Yeah, and check it, check it

[Verse 2]
So when that pond thaws and it's no longer Gretzky
That's when we jetski
I gotta catch up to myself, I kind of left me
Are the windows still blocked up? Let's see
Maybe see something we couldn't view before
Been in the stu all day cooking food for thought
Now out the soup du jour for you and yours
Might find sushi for your soul, we call that moving raw
Lions won't cross the line
Cougars won't move a paw
Chickens won't cross the road
Dogs won't roof at all
Always had flow, just added a front door, roof, and walls
Hotter than the fire that into which Koopa falls
But that's only if you super dawg
Sicker than when you use your dog to do assaults
You can never really tell just who's the fraud
Truth might still be alive like true and false
That's why I never really trust unless it's Lu endorsed
Sponsored by me and of course you know who enforced
Now that's three mis, like you warming up your vocal chords
Add a fourth if your vocals hoarse
Like Mister Ed
Get out of pocket have a horse's head in your bed
Now that's what I call a good night's rest
You know? You know, just plays like that
When you just let it flow
When you sit back and just let it go, you know?

[Verse 3]
And now my vocals warm
Add a fifth and a sixth now I'm ready to perform
The Buddhist said that I am not reformed
If I ever be reborn I keep coming back as me
Well don't forget the other five as we
Weave the most wanted Angelina Jolies
And Morgan Frees
Send it around the room like we smoking trees
But it's no purple in the circle then there ain't no rolling b's
Just spoken words, thought provoking reeds
Hydro, I'm still strolling on the seeds
Eye low, like the lotion from the leaves
And to achieve it took a lot of token like Chuck E. Cheese
All without touching weed
But I'm still hungry and I'm having lunch for three
This is my form, now what the function be

[Outro]
And art what I draw
And ooh, what I say like Imogen Heap
Good night niggas, go to sleep
You know? It's like form follows function
And if you function properly then
The form will come out of it
And whatever it is, it
It just be what it is, you know?

[Verse 1]
You've never met before
But still she greets you like a long lost rock 'n' roll
She's definitely one of those
Where you'll go wherever she goes
And with my body on my mind
Both stop talking at the exact same time
Trying to think of ways to make her mine
But they're difficult to find

[Chorus]
It's not what I need
No, your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me

[Verse 2]
And she said, "Oh
Well, I know this will sound cold
But I really have to go
No, it's not that I'm not free
There's nowhere I need to be
It's just your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me"

[Chorus]
It's not what I need
No, your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me

[Bridge]
And she said, "Baby, how can I believe you?
How can I believe you when you can't believe your luck?
No point sticking to the plan when it's come unstuck"

[Verse 3]
It's more a hunger than a thirst
She'll break your heart the second time
Before you know about the first
Looks well equipped to leave you in the lurch
But you'd let her do her worst
And it's not hard to tell
It's obvious the other angels' faces fell
When she told him that she had to go
Swapped her wings and overcoat for something colourful
Tha knows

[Chorus]
It's not what I need
No, your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me
No, your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me
No, your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me
No, your love's not what I need
So don't give it to me
Your love's not what I need

[Verse 1]
I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island, time-traveling
Diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
Come to find you four in some velvet morning
Years too late, she's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

[Chorus]
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine? Woah, ah

[Verse 2]
I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape, lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

[Chorus]
And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?)

[Bridge]
And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case, I'm mistaken, I
Just wanna hear you say, "You got me, baby
Are you mine?"

[Breakdown]
She's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

[Chorus]
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?)
(Or just mine tonight?)

[Verse 1]
Satellites flashing by
It's a beautiful state we're in
But how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try
We're nothing like we seem
Passionate words are never spoken
You don't know how I bleed
When I leave your side

[Chorus]
In your eyes, love's alive
You've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites

[Verse 2]
Take all the rules away
How can we live if we don't change?
We're always on display
Let's run and hide

[Chorus]
In our eyes, love's alive
We've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites

[Bridge]
If we don't communicate
We'll exist in our own space
We have all the love we need
While we're apart, I cannot breathe

[Outro]
Satellites flashing by
Satellites

[Verse]
I jumped in the river and what did I see?
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

[Verse]
I jumped into the river
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

[Verse 1: Beck]
Centrifugal force pulling me off-course, in a horse race
Changing horses midstream, fourteenth place
On videotape surveillance playback
Sigh you lose face, disgraced, God forbid you
Fall off of the face of the Earth to chase
The black hole of what you thought it was worth today
"Don't shoot the piano player" I heard them say
It was your fault, centrifugal force, you got caught
Convict monotonous, a verdict thoughtless
As you read it out loud, at least I was being relatively honest
Standing in your office trying to speak to some anacondas
Eking solace out of the sawdust
While your doppelganger stands topless
No one notices, they got their own dramas
Drama-rama's melodramas
You draw commas on the eyes of madonnas
And wonder why you can't turn traumas into nirvanas

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Don't mess your head up, still run with these young bucks
Still runnin' on jet fuel, still pimpin' on what-what
What was I thinkin'? I wasn't; What am I drinkin'? I'm buzzin'
Speakin' of weekends I used to fuck with your cousin
I used to rap about nothin', now I rap about nothin'
But that nothin' was somethin' that ain't nobody was bumpin'
See I still got it boo-boo, just a dad'll do you
Wonders if you don't wanna be under some gross dude
But most girls will do it just for a corner seat at Nobu
I bet your daughter's perfect, he say it like he know you
My daughter isn't living yet, Atwater Village idiot
Their flow's dumb, but that royalty's the silliest, now

[Outro: Childish Gambino]
Someone tell these niggas I ain't fuckin' 'round
Fly them all to Vegas man we hold it down
Livin' for the present, nigga we fuck futures
Sippin' on some whiskey, these bitches drinkin' Kombucha
Recession means more oppression, these niggas will shoot ya
Rio de Janeiro, these bitches lookin' like Xuxa
Talk with anacondas, at least I'm bein' honest
I'm tryin' to turn these Keke Palmers into baby mamas
Baby mama, I'm your baby, mama
Man, let your boy drown, they ain't save me, mama
They ain't save me, mama
They ain't save me, mama
Silk pillow for that new weave
Silk pillow for that new weave

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Tell the D.A., give a fuck bout what the judge say
I never liked that pussy nigga in the first place
I spent 500 K a week just for the court case
And put a tattoo on my face, so now I'm Scarface
Scarface
I put a hundred on your head if you cross me
Scarface
I want him dead, I don't care what it cost me

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
The Black Cats, Red Dogs, jumping out on me
Unmarked cars keep on riding up and down the street
Plus the stupid-ass junkie, he want something for free
Know damn well, without no money he get nothing from me
I be that ass, baby momma call the folks on me
I got these crab-ass niggas trying to smoke for free
Lil G just told me that he's short this week
But how the fuck he gonna be short when I sell work so cheap?
Old pussy-ass nigga used to work for me
Then told these motherfucking folks he bought some work for me
I know some cold-blooded killers who got love for me
I keep them real-deal goons in the club with me
Gucci

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Scarface]
Niggas waiting on me like the mailman coming
First, third, and fifteenth, everybody running
Old heads tripping cause they asking me to front on them
Come short on my one time, and I fuck with them young'uns
All balls, no brains; niggas know I'm ignorant
Understand and get zeroed when put in that predicament
The cars ride up and down the avenue in daytime
Nighttime the same thing -- niggas finna pay mine
Duck off with my motherfucking dope, you got some long nuts
I burn niggas' hoods down, I shoot up they dope cuts
Niggas call me Scarface cause I gave them a reason to
All you get is one chance and then I come get even, fool

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Moving them grams, and I ain't thinking bout Grammys
Got so hot in Atlanta, I had to move to Miami
Going honey baked H.A.M., got my trap house whamming
Just ran up on the plug, I brought the food to the family
We say hello to drugs, we don't say no to drugs
Like No Limit C-Murder, making moves with the dubs
Like I'm moving them birds, I got em for sale
Just like Revenge of the Nerds, I got a roomful of squares
The Feds looking at me -- get some glasses, my nigga
They say I make it hot -- I make it happen, my nigga
So what's cracking, what's popping?
Got the same gun that killed Bin Laden
I like my boxer briefs soft cotton
I'm used to being spoiled rotten
It's Gucci

[Hook]

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
On 285, on 285, I don't know where I'm goin' on 285, I drink when I drive
I just love when I'm high, I don't know here I'm goin', on 285, on 285 (x2)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I come equipped with 2 straps on my lap, move back, 45 tucked by my side
Sip a little bit of this, sip that, drink up, I'm so drunk when I drive
I'm wood grain, grippin' and tippin' on some 24's
I puff the magic dragon and then blow smoke out of my nose
I try to tell 'em ain't nothing changed, but the mileage on the range
It's baby powder white, and I whip it like cocaine
All up and down 285, and I'm goin around in circles man
My partners call me Prince, cause they know I got that Purple Rain
Burners along my waist belt, gotta pull up my pants like I'm Urkel, man
My girlfriend said, "You sure?" I said, "Bitch, I'm for certain, man!"
I'm hurtin' the game so bad, they can't keep up when I'm counting this scrilla
My momma quit her job, cause I got her workin with six figures
Yes, she's workin' with six figures, and niggas is workin' like some slaves
She retired a little bit early, because her son is fuckin' paid
And she ain't gotta do shit but be rich and stay alive
And once an awhile just take her Lexus and drive on 285

[Verse 1]
No, I'm not color blind
I know the world is black and white
I try to keep an open mind
But, I just can't sleep on this tonight

[Chorus]
Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly, won't someone stop this train?

[Verse 2]
Don't know how else to say it
Don't want to see my parents go
One generation's length away
From fighting life out on my own

[Chorus]
Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly, won't someone stop this train?

[Piano Interlude]

[Verse 3]
So scared of getting older
I'm only good at being young
So I play the numbers game
To find a way to say that life has just begun

[Bridge 1]
Had a talk with my old man
Said, "Help me understand"
He said, "Turn 68, you'll renegotiate"

[Chorus]
"Don't stop this train
Don't, for a minute, change the place you're in
And don't think I couldn't ever understand
I tried my hand
John, honestly, we'll never stop this train"

[Bridge 2]
Once in a while, when it's good
It'll feel like it should
And they're all still around
And they're still safe and sound
And you don't miss a thing
'Til you cry when you're driving away in the dark

[Chorus]
Singing, "Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
'Cause, now, I see, I'll never stop this train"

[Verse 1]
I’ll give the bar-b-’cues’
Show and tell you how to move
If you’re 5 or 82, this is something you can do

[Pre-Chorus]
Pop it, lock it, polka dot it
Countrify, then hip-hop it
Put your hawk in the sky, move side to side
Jump to the left, stick it, glide

[Chorus]
Zig zag cross the flo’, shuffle in diagonal
When the drum hits, hands on your hips
One-footed 180 twist, and then a
Zig zag, step, slide
Lean it left, clap three times
Shake it out, head to toe
Throw it all together that’s how we roll

[Post-Chorus]
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Throw it all together that’s how we roll

[Verse 2]
We get to 4, 5, 6
And you’re feelin’ busted
But it’s not time to quit
Practice makes you perfect

[Pre-Chorus]
Pop it, lock it, polka dot it
Countrify, then hip-hop it
Put your hawk in the sky, move side to side
Jump to the left, stick it, glide

[Chorus]
Zig zag cross the flo’, shuffle in diagonal
When the drum hits, hands on your hips
One-footed 180 twist, and then a
Zig zag, step, slide
Lean it left, clap three times
Shake it out, head to toe
Throw it all together that’s how we roll

[Post-Chorus]
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Throw it all together that’s how we roll

Boom d'clap, d'clap, boom boom clap
C'mon, here we go!
Boom boom clap, boom d'clap, d'clap
Boom boom clap, boom d'clap

[Pre-Chorus]
Pop it, lock it, polka dot it
Countrify, then hip-hop it
Put your hawk in the sky, move side to side
Jump to the left, stick it, glide

[Chorus]
Zig zag cross the flo’, shuffle in diagonal
When the drum hits, hands on your hips
One-footed 180 twist, and then a
Zig zag, step, slide
Lean it left, clap three times
Shake it out, head to toe
Throw it all together that’s how we roll

[Post-Chorus]
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Throw it all together that’s how we roll
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Throw it all together that’s how we roll

[Outro]
Boom dap clap, b-boom d'clap clap clap
Boom dap clap, b-boom d'clap clap
Boom d'clap, boom d'clap d'clap
Throw it all together, that's how we roll

[Verse 1]
From the moment I saw you, I stopped everything 'cause nothing else mattered
'Cause I had to have you and I knew I couldn't get nothing better
It felt like destiny, or Cupid shot me with an arrow through my heart
When you're next to me, I'm stupid in love

[Pre-Chorus]
And your body's telling me something
And we be sweating making love, bed bumping
Ooh, I hear you screaming
You're yelling, "Give it to me daddy, I need it," girl, you

[Chorus]
You done made me change, got me thinking 'bout giving you this ring, girl
It might seem strange but I love the way you make me feel when you sexing (Oh, oh, oh)
We can do it on a plane, even outside in the cold, in the rain, girl
When we're loving, I need a second serving, of you

[Verse 2]
Ooh, your lips I taste and I'ma slide my hands down to your waist
Damn, I wish I could keep you prisoner for just a day
Got me thinking, could you have my kids? Big house and a dog, you my wife
I'm about to go all out, take it all off 'cause it's going down tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
And your body's telling me something
And we be sweating making love, bed bumping
Ooh, I hear you screaming
You're yelling, "Give it to me daddy, I need it," girl, you
Well you know the rest, ha

[Chorus]
You done made me change (You done made me), got me thinking 'bout giving you this ring, oh girl
It might seem strange but I love the way you make me feel when you sexing (Oh, oh, oh)
We can do it on a plane (Oh yeah), even outside in the cold, in the rain, girl (Oh)
When we're loving, I need a second serving, of you

[Bridge]
Take my hand (Hand), lemme put this ring on your finger (Oh)
I'm your man (Man), girl, you got an R&B singer (Oh)
And it's a party (Oh), party (Oh)
Yeah, it's a party (Oh), girl, you make me

[Chorus]
You done made me change, got me thinking 'bout giving you this ring, girl
It might seem strange but I (Oh, oh, oh)
We can do it on a plane (Plane), even outside in the cold, in the rain, girl
When we're loving (Yeah), I need a second serving, of you

[Outro]
Oh, woah

I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no

[Verse 2]
I'm so tired, I don't know what to do
I'm so tired, my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do

[Chorus]
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

[Verse 3]
I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh, he was such a stupid git

[Chorus]
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane!
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Another minute's gone and I know it's coming
You're about to say "Don't go, don't go"
Believe me when I tell you, wish that there was something
Something I could say, but you know, you know
Never know how long I'm ever gon' be gone
If I could buy a minute then you know that I would spend it with you
Kissing, touching, hugging, making love (making love)

[Chorus: Johntá Austin]
I wish money could buy me time
I wish I could stay a day through the night
But it's never, never
I try to say what's going on
But before I know it, you moan and it's gone
Cause it's never, never, never
I love everything you do
That's why I try to stay with you
And I would if I could but I can't cause she's calling me too
Swear there's never enough time in a day…
No, no

[Verse 2: Trey Songz & Johntá Austin]
She call me busy busy bee
(Cause I'm) never ever free
(And err) time I get up in it she begging me not too leave (no)
I wish there was some more me
And I didn't have to run
Shit, I wish there was another me
But there's only one
I just need you part of me
And while your body's calling me
I check the other line, find another dime
And she'd never do
Ain't gonna lie when I'm gone I'm missing you
It's a trip how I live

[Chorus: Johntá Austin]
I wish money could buy me time
I wish I could stay a day through the night
But it's never, never
I try to say what's going on
But before I know it, you moan and it's gone
Cause it's never, never, never
I love everything you do
That's why I try to stay with you
And I would if I could but I can't cause she's calling me too
Swear there's never enough time in a day
No, no

[Verse 3: Johntá Austin]
In a perfect world we'd chill
But the world ain't perfect cause it's never, never, never
Wanna be in yours but you know
That I can't so I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take
I'm gonna have to take that pain

[Chorus: Johntá Austin]
I wish money could buy me time
I wish I could stay a day through the night
But it's never, never
I try to say what's going on
But before I know it, you moan and it's gone
Cause it's never, never, never
I love everything you do
That's why I try to stay with you
And I would if I could but I can't cause she's calling me too
Swear it's never enough time in a day
No, no

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be traveling on, now
'Cause there's too many places I've got to see

[Pre-Chorus]
But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And the bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows, I can't change

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Bye, bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah yeah
Though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take it so badly
'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame

[Pre-Chorus]
But, if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you'll never change

Lord, I can't change
Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
When it started we had high hopes
Now my back's on the line
My back's on the ropes
When it started we were alright
But night makes a fool
Of us in the daylight

[Verse 2]
There we were dying of frustration
Saying, "Lord lead me not into temptation"
But it’s not easy when she turns you on
Sin, stay gone

[Chorus]
If you’d only, if you’d only say yes
Whether you will's anybody’s guess
God, only God knows I'm trying my best
But I’m just so tired of this loneliness

[Interlude]
Hey!

[Verse 3]
So up they picked me by the big toe
I was held from the rooftop then they let go
Dizzily screaming "Let the windows down!"
As I crumble to the ground

[Chorus]
If you'd only if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God, only God knows she won't let me rest
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness
I've become so tired of this loneliness

[Intro]

Black cloud crossed my mind

My trap beating harder than a bass drum(x3)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
These bitches eating pills like they jolly ranchers
She took a pill then turned into a belly dancer
I'm cooking up this dope with 2 fucking bowls
I need an extra hand, I needs 3 extra stoves
I can make you dance, do an avalanche
It's your final chance, get your wedding bands
I keep that white girl like a white man
East Atlanta zone 6 you in trap land
My money got a vert, my shit jump out the gym
Bitches damn near break their neck, just too look at him
She don't really like me but she love my rims
Yellow Lamborghini same color my butter Tims

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
My trap boomin' hard, bitch I swear to God
My trap boomin' hard, bitch I swear to God
My trap boomin' harder than your trap boom
My goons countin' money in the living room
My trap boomin' hard, bitch I swear to God

My trap boomin' harder than your trap boom
My goons countin' money in the living room

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
AR's and choppers ain't no ho niggas gonna stop us
Yo ol lady so proper look at that pussy she poppin
I pull out the Rolls and make that top go to droppin
When I pull out my money
Even these ho niggas watchin
When I hit a lick it I bought a wingstop (Twenty of em)
I sprinkle lemon pepper in that re-rock
I took my time I had to build a fortress
Straight flossin and my closet look like Walter's
Step out the Benz, I got my Gucci skully on
Shout out my Nigga Gucci, know it money long
Got my bond money, I got my lawyer fee
Shout out the Brick Squad, my shoes are quarter key

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
My trap boomin' hard, bitch I swear to God
My trap boomin' hard, bitch I swear to God

(Santa rap)
1, 2, 1, 2, King James and Kobe too
It was the day before Christmas day
I just put brand new rims on my sleigh
In the kitchen cooking, eggs and hash
I got a call from Blitzen talkin some trash, sayin

(Blitzen )
Oh saint Nicky, don’t you see
You and your boys you’ll never beat me
So you can tell Kobe and tell LeBron
That they can meet me on the court and it’ll be uh-uh onnnn

(Santa)
Now Blitz ice grillin, like put em up
It ain’t take long for Kobe to shut em up
(Kobe)
Alright Blitz, the game is to 10
LeBron, check it out and show em how we get it in
(Santa )
Now he all nervous, tension brewing
Vixen was trying to talk some sense into em
LeBron threw the ball and he began to giggle em, like
(LeBron)
Look at this reindeer, he can barely dribble
(Kobe)
C’mon Bron, show some respect
He got hooves, not hands, what the heck you expect

(Santa)
Kobe stole the ball, crossed him up
Runnin around his back, tossed it up
Vixen crying to Blitz, like

(Vixen)
Oh no, lebron took off from behind the free throw

(Santa)
LeBron rose up looked at him again
Said, Merry Christmas Blitz and shattered the rim

The game is over, the game is over
The game is over, the game is over
Dunking on the reindeer, dunking on the reindeer
Dunking on the reindeer, dunking on the reindeer

[Verse 1]
Have you seen the little piggies crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies, life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in

[Verse 2]
Have you seen the bigger piggies in their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in

[Bridge]
In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their life, there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking!

[Verse 3]
Everywhere there's lots of piggies living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner with their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon

[Outro]
One more time

[Verse 1]
Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

[Chorus]
And Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

[Verse 2]
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now, she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe-down
And Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 3]
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"

[Chorus]
And now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

[Outro]
C'mon, Rocky boy
C'mon, Rocky boy

[Verse 1]
I listen for your footsteps coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps, but they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear, on my old front door
I don't hear it--does it mean you don't love me any more?

[Verse 2]
I hear the clock a'ticking on the mantel shelf
See the hands a'moving, but I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight, and why I'm by myself
I don't see you, does it mean you don't love me any more?

[Chorus]
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, how I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair
You were in a car crash, and you lost your hair
You said that you would be late, about an hour or two
I said that's alright, I'm waiting here, just waiting to hear from you

[Chorus]
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, I'll hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

[Interlude]
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

[Chorus]
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, I'll hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

[Verse 1]
Who knows how long I've loved you?
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
If you want me to, I will

[Verse 2]
For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

[Bridge]
Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart

[Verse 3]
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh, you know, I will
I will

[Outro]
Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
Da da da da da da da

[Verse 1]
Sexy Sadie, what have you done?
You made a fool of everyone
You made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie, oh, what have you done?

[Verse 2]
Sexy Sadie, you broke the rules
You laid it down for all to see
You laid it down for all to see
Sexy Sadie, oh, you broke the rules

[Bridge 1]
One sunny day, the world was waiting for a lover (Sexy Sadie)
She came along to turn on everyone
Sexy Sadie, the greatest of them all (Sexy Sadie, she's the greatest)

[Verse 3]
Sexy Sadie, how did you know?
The world was waiting just for you
The world was waiting just for you
Sexy Sadie, oh, how did you know?

[Verse 4]
Sexy Sadie, you'll get yours yet
However big you think you are
However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie, oh, you'll get yours yet

[Bridge 2]
We gave her everything we owned just to sit at her table
(Sexy Sadie)
Just a smile would lighten everything
Sexy Sadie, she's the latest and the greatest of them all

[Outro]
Ooh woo
She made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie
However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie

[Verse 1]
It's been a long, long, long time
How could I ever have lost you
When I loved you?

[Verse 2]
It took a long, long, long time
Now I'm so happy I found you
How I love you

[Bridge]
So many tears I was searching
So many tears I was wasting, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
Now I can see you, be you
How can I ever misplace you?
How I want you
Oh, I love you
You know that I need you
Oh, I love you

[Verse 1: 2D]
O, green world
Don't desert me now
Bring me back to Fallen Town
Where someone is still alive
Fighting for something new in this
When no one needs the heart of me
And I'm looking out somewhere I've never been before
Been before

[Verse 2: 2D]
O, green world
Don't desert me now
Made of you, and you of me
But where are we?
Oh no, sells to lie
From the darkest stars that force you
Down when you’re in first
Does it seem so little to you?
I know you now
I know you know me too
You know me too
Hope, sex and drugs thrust into myself, holy
It feels holy
It’s fun when you’re the father in the place you were

[Verse 1]
Like a cloud his fingers explode
On the typewriter ribbon, the shadow grows
His hearts in a bowl behind the bank
And every evening when he gets home
To make his supper and eat it alone
His black shirt cries
While his shoes get cold

[Hook]
It's just a dream he keeps having
And it doesn't seem to mean anything
And it doesn't seem to mean anything

[Verse 2]
One summer, a suicide
Another autumn, a traveler's guide
He hits snooze twice before he dies
And every evening when he gets home
To make his supper and eat it alone
His black shirt cries
While his shoes get cold

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
He feels lucky to have you here
In his kitchen, in your chair
Sometimes he forgets that you're even there

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I'm standing by your locker
In the hallway after class
Swear I'm amazed, yeah
The drawing in my binder
Every picture I put a halo on your head

[Pre-Hook]
I'm on waiting on my angel
My first love
My first kiss
My second, my third
The one my momma like so much

[Hook]
I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still
I'm standing still, standing still
Oh, standing still

[Verse 2]
Saturdays I'm at the snow cone spot
Trying to guess your favorite flavor
I'm thinking cotton candy, maybe
I bought it and I placed it on the table next to me
I wish you could taste it
Cause it's surely melting

[Pre-Hook]
I'm on waiting on my angel
My first love
My first kiss
My second, my third
The one my momma like so much

[Hook]
I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still

[Bridge]
While the rain storm takes over, outrageous baby
I'll be standing here, seconds forward
I'll take it later, I'll be right there
Oh no, matter what I'll be here
However long

[Hook]
I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still

I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still
I'm standing still, standing still
Oh, standing still

[Verse 1]
Sad he never takes her no where
And she always in these rooms
She was more than just a phone call
She says she's really in the mood

Don't you move cause I'm coming
Girl tell him don't bother
Cause baby I'm rushin to you
Don't you move

[Hook]
Girl you know thats all you needed to say
You got it, you got it
Let me grab a jacket and I'm on the way
You got it, you got it, oh
You want more, you want more
Is that enough, is that enough

You got it, you got it all
You know the words, you know the number
You got 'em
So quit playing, a couple words I'm coming running
You got 'em so just say 'em
Yea I'ma knock twice when I get there
Then we can make love in one of those rooms
..show you the ocean ohh

Don't you move 'cause I'm coming
'Cause baby I'm rushin to you
Don't you move

[Hook]
Girl you know thats all you needed to say
You got it, you got it
Let me grab a jacket and I'm on the way
You got it, you got it, oh

I'm very proud to say that I got you
Like a guy need you yeah
Show you off like a brand new set of wheels
See you lights baby tell me how it feels
(......)
(......)
Yeah yeah
Baby

[Verse 1]
Genuine day will come
When the wind decides to run
And shakes the stairs that stab the wall
And turns the page in a future age

[Verse 2]
Some trees will bend and some will fall
But then again so will us all
Let's turn our prayers into outrageous dares
And mark our page in a future age

[Verse 3]
High above
The sea of cars
And barking dogs
In fenced-in yards

[Verse 1]
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
Where the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
Drive on engines till they weep
With future pixels in factories far away
So call the mainland from the beach
Your heart is now washed up in bleach
The waves are rising for this time of year
And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Under sunshine pylons, we'll meet
While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky

[Chorus]
(Uh)
(Mmmmm)

[Verse 2]
I can't see you now my heart is frozen
All the bowses and the growses
Have been abstinated in my soul
I prayed on the immovable
Yet clinging to the atoms of rock
Seasons see adjustment signs of change
I can't see now, she said, "Taxi"
Now that light is all I can take
This dawn brings strange loyalties and skies
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away

[Chorus]
(Here we go again)
That's electric
(Uh)
That's electric

[Verse 3]
Helicopters fly over the beach
Same time every day, same routine
A clear target in the summer when skies are blue
It's part of the noise when winter comes
It reverberates in my lungs
Nature's corrupted in factories far away

[Chorus]
(Here we go again)
That's electric
Your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky (Uh)
That's electric
With future pixels in factories far away
(Here we go again)
That's electric
Your love's like rhinestones falling from the sky (Uh)
That's electric
With future pixels in factories far away
(Here we go again)

[Verse 1]
Said, a place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine
I cry at times, I once contemplated suicide
I would've tried, but when I held that 9
All I could see was my momma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside of misery and poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I've survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dogs ain't got a choice but to roll on
We finally find a spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trickness
A spot where we can smoke in peace
Even though we G's, we still visualize places we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eyes, see this place where players go and pass it
Got a spot for us all, we can ball at thug's mansion

[Chorus]
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothin' but peace and love
Street passion, every ghetto needs a thug's mansion
Thug's mansion, oh, oh
Nothin' but peace and love
Street passion, ghetto needs a thug's mansion

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I see the world for how messed up it really is
Tell myself I'll be the one to make a change in it
I could die tonight, not make it to the sunrise
But then I wouldn't heal the pain in it
I'm gettin' high to forget about the lows though
Get a paycheck, spend it all on Polo
Designer brands cover up my insecurities
Personally I ain't nothin' but an average Joe though
And now I'm dressin' so expensive for no reason
Cold world we livin' in, it's below freezin'
I got some fam who can't afford a coat
So I leave a little paper there before I go
I spend a thousand on a hotel, they poor and broke
It make me wonder who I'm prayin' to before the show
This a letter to whoever, I'm just hopin' that you see
Remember love and remember me

[Chorus]
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, 'cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothin' but peace and love
Street passion, every ghetto needs a thug's mansion
Thug's mansion, oh, oh
Nothin' but peace and love
Street passion, every ghetto needs a thug's mansion

[Intro]
I wish, I wish, I wish
(To every city)
I wish, I wish, I wish
(Every hood)
I wish, I wish, I wish
(And every block)
I wish, I wish, I wish
(Ghetto America!)

[Verse 1]
Rolling through the hood, just stopped by to say what's up
And let you know that your baby boy ain't doing so tough
And even though you passed, going on four long years
I'm still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days you used to talk to me
Smiling while I'm sipping on this Hennessy
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy

[Pre-Chorus]
And now you hear my songs the radio is playing
Oh, I can't believe my ears and what everybody's saying
And boy, I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride
(With you)
How I used to kick it on the front porch
(With you)
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
(With you)
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish

[Chorus]
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

[Verse 2]
Now ever since this money come, ut's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say, "Boy, you've been blessed"
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shooting this real shit off like a gun
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits
And fake ass players get a real player hating 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around
But y'all don't wanna raise the roof
Until my shit is going down

[Pre-Chorus]
And now you hear my songs the radio is playing
Oh, I can't believe my ears and what everybody's saying
And, boy, I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride
(With you)
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments
(With you)
And how I used to club hop on weekends
(With you)
Your family called the morning of a tragic end
Damn, my condolences

[Chorus]
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish

[Verse 3]
Voices in my head be telling me to come to church
Saying the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse
When waking up to life sometimes seems worse
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies land
For me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion fans?

[Pre-Chorus]
And now you hear my songs the radio is playing
Oh, I can't believe my ears and what everybody's saying
And, boy, I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up just to take one ride
(With you)
How I used to street perform on Friday
(With you)
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday
(With you)
Instead of you all throwing them stones at me
Somebody pray for me

[Chorus: Choir]
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face

[Verse 1]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Verse 2]
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Bridge]
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door

[Verse 3]
I'm painting the room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong
Silly people run around, they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door

[Verse 4]
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah

[Outro]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
Where it will go
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Verse 1]
I know everybody on this planet wished that they had you
I feel so blessed, baby, it's an honor that I got you
I know every man probably told you that he loved you
This ain't no ordinary love song, no, this ain't no ordinary love song

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'ma say it in the stadium
Scream it like an anthem
Say it from the mountain top
Sing it like your favorite song
I'ma put my cards on the table for you

[Chorus]
'Cause I, I, I love you
And baby, there's nothing in the world that I won't do for you
Oh, I, I, I love you
I gotta tell you 'bout a million, trillion times
Baby, you're the best thing in my life

[Verse 2]
Put your hand on my heart, can't you feel that boom, boom, boom?
Only one reason that it beats is for you
Well in this love game, baby, I play the fool
But this is no ordinary love song, no, this ain't no ordinary love song

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'ma say it in the stadium
Scream it like an anthem
Say it from the mountain top
Sing it like your favorite song
I'ma put my cards on the table for you

[Chorus]
'Cause I, I, I love you
And baby, there's nothing in the world that I won't do for you
Oh, I, I, I love you
I gotta tell you 'bout a million, trillion times
Baby, you're the best thing in my life

[Bridge]
For once in my life, once in my life
I can see clear 'cause you open my eyes
For once in my life, once in my life
No doubt in my mind, you're the only one for me, baby, can't you see?
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh (Oh, oh, oh-woah-oh)
I'm so oh, oh-woah-oh in love

[Chorus]
'Cause I, I, I love you
And baby, there's nothing in the world that I won't do for you
Oh, I, I, I love you
I gotta tell you 'bout a million, trillion times
Baby, you're the best thing in my life

[Verse 1]
For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In his way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

[Verse 2]
The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill

[Verse 1: Mike Love]
I had to prove that I could make it alone now
But that's not me
I wanted to show how independent I'd grown now
But that's not me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Love]
I could try to be big in the eyes of the world
What matters to me is what I could be to just one girl

[Chorus 1: Mike Love and Brian Wilson]
I'm a little bit scared 'cause I haven't been home in a long time
You needed my love and I know that I left at the wrong time

[Verse 2: Mike Love]
My folks when I wrote them told 'em what I was up to
Said that's not me
I went through all kinds of changes, took a look at myself
And said that's not me

[Pre-Chorus 2: Mike Love]
I miss my pad and the places I've known
And every night as I lay there alone
I would dream

[Chorus 2: Mike Love and Brian Wilson]
I once had a dream, so I packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty
I'm glad I went now I'm that much more sure that we're ready

[Outro: Mike Love]
I once had a dream, so I packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty
I once had a dream, so I packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty

[Verse 1: Brian Wilson]
I can hear so much in your sighs
And I can see so much in your eyes
There are words we both could say

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
But don't talk, put your head on my shoulder
Come close, close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, take my hand and let me hear your heart beat

[Verse 2: Brian Wilson]
Being here with you feels so right
We could live forever tonight
Let's not think about tomorrow

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
And don't talk, put your head on my shoulder
Come close, close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, take my hand and listen to my heart beat

[Bridge: Brian Wilson]
Listen, listen, listen

[Outro: Brian Wilson]
Don't talk, put your head on my shoulder
Don't talk, close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, put your head on my shoulder
Don't talk, close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, put your head on my shoulder

[Verse 1: Brian Wilson]
I came along when he broke your heart
That's when you needed someone to help forget about him
I gave you love with a brand new start
That's what you needed the most to set your broken heart free

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
I know you cried, and you felt blue
But when I could, I gave strength to you
I'm waiting for the day when you can love again

[Verse 2: Brian Wilson]
I kissed your lips and when your face looked sad
It made me think about him and that you still loved him so
(Baby, don't you know) That pretty soon, I made you feel glad
That you belonged to me and love began to show

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
He hurt you then, but that's all gone
I guess I'm saying you're the only one
I'm waiting for the day when you can love again

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
He hurt you then, but that's all done
I guess I'm saying you're the only one
I'm waiting for the day when you can love again

[Outro: Brian Wilson]
You didn't think, no, that I could sit around and let him work
You didn't think, no, that I could sit around and watch him take you
You didn't think that I could sit around and watch him go
You didn't think that I could sit back and let you go
You didn't think that I could sit around and let you go

[Verse 1: Brian Wilson]
We come on the sloop John B
My grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinkin' all night
Got into a fight
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home

[Chorus: Brian Wilson & Mike Love]
So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore, let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home, yeah, yeah
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home

[Verse 2: Mike Love]
The first mate, he got drunk
And broke in the captain's trunk
The constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone
Why don't you leave me alone? Yeah, yeah
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home

[Chorus: Whole Group]
So hoist up the John B's sail (Hoist up the John B's sail)
See how the mainsail sets (See how the mainsail sets)
Call for the captain ashore, let me go home
Let me go home, I wanna go home
Let me go home (Hoist up the John B's sail)
Hoist up the John B (Hoist up the John B)
I feel so broke up
I wanna go home, let me go home

[Verse 3: Brian Wilson, Mike Love]
The poor cook, he caught the fits
And threw away all my grits
And then he took and he ate up all of my corn
Let me go home
Why don't they let me go home?
This is the worst trip I've ever been on

[Chorus: All]
So hoist up the John B's sail (Hoist up the John B's sail)
See how the mainsail sets (See how the mainsail sets)
Call for the captain ashore, let me go home
Let me go home, I wanna go home
Let me go home

[Verse 1: Carl Wilson]
I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it

[Refrain: Carl Wilson]
God only knows what I'd be without you

[Verse 2: Carl Wilson]
If you should ever leave me
Well, life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?

[Refrain: Carl Wilson]
God only knows what I'd be without you

[Interlude: Carl Wilson, Brian Wilson, and Bruce Johnston]
Ooh, ooh
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Bow, buh-bow, buh-bow, buh-bow (Do, do, do, do)
Buh-bow, buh-bow, buh-bow (Do, do, do, do, do, do)
Buh-bow, buh-bow, buh-bow, buh-bow (Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do)

[Refrain: Carl Wilson]
God only knows what I'd be without you

[Verse 3: Carl Wilson]
If you should ever leave me
Well, life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?

[Chorus: Carl Wilson]
God only knows what I'd be without you

[Outro: Carl Wilson with Brian Wilson and Bruce Johnston]
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you (What I'd be)
God only knows what I'd be without you (God only knows)
God only knows what I'd be without you (What I'd be)
God only knows what I'd be without you (God only knows)
God only knows what I'd be without you (What I'd be)
God only knows what I'd be without you (God only knows)
God only knows what I'd be without you (What I'd be)
God only knows what I'd be without you (God only knows)
God only knows what I'd be without you (What I'd be)
God only knows what I'd be without you (God only knows)

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
It was twenty years ago today
When Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Chorus: Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, & Ringo Starr]
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Bridge: Paul McCartney, John Lennon, & George Harrison]
It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought you might like to know
That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Intro: Paul McCartney, John Lennon and George Harrison]
It's getting better all the time

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon and George Harrison)]
I used to get mad at my school (No, I can't complain)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool (No, I can't complain)
You're holding me down (Ah-ah), turning me 'round (Ah-oh)
Filling me up with your rules (Fool, you fool)

[Chorus: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon and George Harrison)]
I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can

[Chorus: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon and George Harrison)]
I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time!

[Post-Chorus: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon and George Harrison)]
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney and John Lennon]
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can (Fool, you fool)

[Chorus: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon and George Harrison)]
I admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
Yes, I admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time!

[Post-Chorus: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon and George Harrison)]
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)

[Outro: Paul McCartney, John Lennon, and George Harrison]
Getting so much better all the time!

[Verse 1: Mike Love, Al Jardine]
I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zones
Now what can you tell them
And what can you say that won't make them defensive?

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
I know there's an answer
I know now but I have to find it by myself

[Verse 2: Mike Love, Al Jardine]
They come on like they're peaceful but inside they're so uptight
They trip through their day and waste all their thoughts at night
Now how can I come on
And tell them the way that they live could be better?

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
I know there's an answer
I know now but I have to find it by myself

[Pre-Chorus 2: Al Jardine]
Now how can I come on
And tell them the way that they live could be better?

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
I know there's an answer
I know now but I have to find it by myself

[Verse 1: Mike Love]
It starts with just a little glance now
Right away you're thinkin' 'bout romance now
You know you ought to take it slower
But you just can't wait to get to know her
A brand new love affair is such a beautiful thing
But if you're not careful think about the pain it can bring

[Pre-Chorus 1: Mike Love]
It makes you feel so bad
It makes your heart feel sad
It makes your days go wrong
It makes your nights so long

[Chorus: Mike Love]
You've got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

[Verse 2: Mike Love]
Right now you think that she's perfection
This time is really an exception
Well, you know I hate to be a downer
But I'm the guy she left before you found her
Well, I'm not saying you won't have a good love with her
But I keep on remembering things like they were

[Pre-Chorus 2: Mike Love]
She made me feel so bad
She made my heart feel sad
She made my days go wrong
And made my nights so long

[Chorus: Mike Love]
You've got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

[Chorus: Mike Love]
Keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast
Love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast
Love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

[Verse 1]
We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away

[Verse 2]
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew

[Chorus 1]
Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?

[Chorus 2]
When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you

[*Sounds of children laughing*]

[Verse 1: Brian Wilson]
I keep looking for a place to fit in
Where I can speak my mind
And I've been trying hard to find the people
That I won't leave behind
They say I got brains but they ain't doing me no good
I wish they could

[Pre-Chorus: Brian Wilson]
Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
Sometimes I feel very sad (¿Cuándo seré?)
Sometimes I feel very sad (Un día seré, Ain't found the right thing I can put my heart and soul into)
Sometimes I feel very sad (Oh, ¿cuando seré? Ain't found the right thing I can put my heart and soul into)
I guess I just wasn't made for these times

[Verse 2: Brian Wilson]
Every time I get the inspiration
To go change things around
No one wants to help me look for places
Where new things might be found
Where can I turn when my fair weather friends cop out?
What's it all about?

[Pre-Chorus: Brian Wilson]
Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
Sometimes I feel very sad (¿Cuándo seré?)
Sometimes I feel very sad (Un día seré, ain't found the right thing I can put my heart and soul into)
Sometimes I feel very sad (Oh, ¿cuándo seré? Ain't found the right thing  I can put my heart and soul into)
I guess I just wasn't made for these times

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: Brian Wilson]
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Bridge 1]
You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

[Verse 2]
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Bridge 2]
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave

[Verse 3]
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Outro]
Whoo!

[Intro]
Yeah
I be eatin' that Pink Slime
Hahaha
Here we go

[Verse 1]
Got my chick makin' drinks with that cream (Cream)
While I'm takin' sips of that lean (Lean)
Life ain't a bitch, well, if you make a wish
You might break a record like me (Me)
Got a mil' at the age of nineteen (Woo!)
But I may just give that back (Woo!)
To show my friends I could do it again
If I started all from scratch, huh
A-A-All I do is rap (Rap)
You could run and tell them hoes that (That)
More pipe than a plumber, it's nice with no rubber
She like when I fuck her like that (That)
This rap's what I do, but I been fly, been fly
You're now inside of my sick mind
That Pink Slime, Pink Slime

[Chorus]
She get good grades, suck good dick
What more could you ask for?
Big ol' butt, love to fuck
What more could you ask for?
Fuck with drugs, fall in love
What more could you ask for?
What more could you ask—
W-W-What more could you ask—

[Verse 2]
Go a hundred miles an hour (Woo!)
Ride around the city (Woo!)
Smokin' on that sour (Sour)
C-C-Couple bad ones with me (With me)
Used to rock all my brother's clothes
Now, designer brands, got a bunch of those (Go, go, go)
Got a bunch of diamonds and a bunch of gold (Go, go, go, go)
Ridin' by the cops, I'm like fuck 'em though (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Hoes turn red for that Hermès
I'm bustin' nuts on her fur vest
My life is like a circus
My head's a little unfurnished
She honor roll, she Dean's list
Her ass round like Venus
My penis in her cleavage
That freaky bitch need Jesus

[Chorus]
She get good grades, suck good dick
What more could you ask for?
Big ol' butt, love to fuck
What more could you ask for?
Fuck with drugs, fall in love
What more could you ask for?
What more could you ask—
W-W-What more could you ask—

[Verse 3]
I'm switchin' up my flows (Flows)
Sellin' out these shows (Shows)
Pop a bottle of Dom P, then spill it all on my clothes (Oh)
Now I'm actin' so grown (Grown)
Made a business all on my own
These labels callin' my phone
But I made this business all on my own (Woo!)
Give me that bass, bitch, I'm a basehead
Let it break shit 'til it make a mess (Ugh)
I wrote myself another blank check
I'm fuckin' ill, need a AIDS test
Win-win the Heisman, I'm MVP (P)
Dan Marino, you Sandusky ('ky)
MC Hammer, they can't touch me (Me)
Skateboard P, he be on that beat (That beat)

[Chorus]
She get good grades, suck good dick
What more could you ask for?
Big ol' butt, love to fuck
What more could you ask for?
Fuck with drugs, fall in love
What more could you ask for?
What more could you ask—
W-W-What more could you ask—

[Verse 1]
I moved out to Langley recently
With a plain and simple dream
Wanna infiltrate some Third-World place (Woo!)
And topple their regime
Those men in black with their matching suitcases
Where everything's on a need-to-know basis;
Agents got that swagger
Everyone's so cloak and dagger
I'm feelin' nervous but I'm really kinda wishing
For an undercover mission
That's when the red alert came on the radio
And I put my earpiece on!
Got my dark sunglasses on!
And I had my weapon drawn!

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So I get my handcuffs
My cyanide pills
My classified dossier
Tappin' the phones like yeah
Shreddin' the files like yeah
I memorized all the enemy spies I've got to neutralize today

[Chorus]
Yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the CIA!
Yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the CIA!

[Verse 2]
I've done a couple of crazy things that have almost gotten me dismissed
Like terminate some head of state who wasn't even on my list
Burn that microfilm buddy, will you
I'd tell you why but then I'd have to kill you!
You need a quickie confession?
Well, start a waterboardin' session!
No hurry on this South American dictator
I'll assassinate him later
That's when he walked right in my laser sights
And my silencer was on
And my silencer was on
And another target's gone!

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Yeah, we've got our black ops all over the world
From Kazakhstan to Bombay
Payin' the bribes like yeah
Pluggin' the leaks like yeah;
Interrogating the scum of the earth
We'll break them by the break of day!

[Chorus]
Yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the CIA!
Yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the CIA!

[Bridge]
Need a country destabilized?
Look no further, we're your guys!
We've got snazzy suits and ties
And a better dental plan than the FBI's!

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Better put your hands up and get in the van
Or else you'll get blown away!
Stagin' a coup like yeah
Brainwashin' moles like yeah
We only torture the folks we don't like
You're probably gonna be okay!

[Chorus]
Yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the CIA!
Yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the CIA!

[Verse 1]
I don't want to be crippled and cracked
Shoulders, wrists, knees, and back
Ground to dust and ash
Crawling on all fours

[Chorus]
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones

[Verse 2]
Now I can't climb the stairs
Pieces missing everywhere
Prozac, painkillers

[Chorus]
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones

[Bridge]
And I used to fly like Peter Pan
All the children flew when I touched their hands

[Outro]
Listen, you've got to feel it in your bones
Listen, you've got to feel it in your bones

[Verse 1]
They love me like I was a brother
They protect me, listen to me
They dug me my very own garden
Gave me sunshine, made me happy

[Chorus]
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream

[Verse 2]
I call up my friend, the good angel
But she's out with her answerphone
She said that she'd love to come help, but
The sea would electrocute us all

[Chorus]
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream (If you think that you're strong enough)
Nice dream (If you think you belong enough)
Nice dream (If you think that you're strong enough)
Nice dream (If you think you belong enough)

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream

[Verse 1]
Can't get the stink off
He's been hanging 'round for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends

[Pre-Chorus 1]
One day he'll get to you
And teach you how to be a holy cow

[Chorus]
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself

[Verse 2]
Don't get my sympathy
Hanging out the fifteenth floor
You've changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door

[Pre-Chorus 2]
One day I'll get to you
And teach you how to get to purest hell

[Chorus]
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself

[Chorus]
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
Self

[Verse 1]
Limb by limb and tooth by tooth
Stirring up inside of me
Every day, every hour
Wish that I
Was bulletproof

[Verse 2]
Wax me, mould me
Heat the pins and stab them in
You have turned me into this
Just wish that it

[Chorus]
Was bulletproof
Was bulletproof

[Verse 3]
So, pay me money and take a shot
Lead, fill the hole in me
I could burst a million bubbles
All surrogate

[Chorus]
And bulletproof
And bulletproof
And bulletproof
Bulletproof

[Verse 1]
I get home from work
And you're still standing in your dressing gown
Well, what am I to do?
I know all the things around your head
And what they do to you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What are we coming to?
What are we gonna do?

[Chorus]
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home

[Verse 2]
The troubled words of a troubled mind
I try to understand what is eating you
I try to stay awake, but it's 58 hours
Since that I last slept with you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
What are we coming to?
I just don't know anymore

[Chorus]
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home

[Verse 3]
I get on the train and I just stand about
Now that I don't think of you
I keep falling over, I keep passing out
When I see a face like you

[Pre-Chorus 3]
What am I coming to?
I'm gonna melt down

[Chorus]
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home

[Outro]
Ah, this is killing me
Ah, this is killing me

[Verse 1]
Rows of houses all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow

[Chorus]
And fade out again
And fade out

[Verse 2]
This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under

[Chorus]
And fade out again
And fade out again

[Verse 3]
Cracked eggs, dead birds, scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow

[Chorus]
And fade out again
And fade out again

[Outro]
Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in love

[Verse 1]
That's how it starts
We go back to your house
You check the charts
And start to figure it out
And if it's crowded, all the better
Because we know we're gonna be up late
But if you're worried about the weather
Then you picked the wrong place to stay
That's how it starts

[Verse 2]
And so it starts
You switch the engine on
We set controls for the heart of the sun
One of the ways that we show our age
And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
If the sun comes up and I still don't wanna stagger home
Then it's the memory of our betters
That are keeping us on our feet
You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again
Oh, you're talking forty-five turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend

[Verse 3]
It comes apart
The way it does in bad films
Except the part
Where the moral kicks in
And when we're running out of the drugs
And the conversation's grinding away
I wouldn't trade one stupid decision
For another five years of life
You drop the first ten years just as fast as you can
And the next ten people who are trying to be polite
When you're blowing eighty-five days in the middle of France
Yeah, I know it gets tired, only where are your friends tonight?

[Verse 4]
And to tell the truth
Oh, this could be the last time
So here we go
Like a sales force into the night
And if I made a fool, if I made a fool
If I made a fool on the road, there's always this
And if I'm sued into submission
I can still come home to this
And with a face like a dad and a laughable stand
You can sleep on the plane or review what you said
When you're drunk and the kids look impossibly tanned
You think over and over, "Hey, I'm finally dead"
Oh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your hand
You can turn it on yourself, you ridiculous clown
You forgot what you meant when you read what you said
And you always knew you were tired, but then

[Chorus]
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight

[Intro: Usher]
Hot thing, hot thing

[Chorus: Usher]
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing
What’s up with it?
Hot thing
What’s up with it?
Hot thing
What’s up with it?
Hot thing
What’s up with it?

[Verse 1: Usher]
Shawty got a body that jeans can't hold
And she moving like she learned everything from the pole
And she loves to party, number one hobby
Out till the morning, better ask somebody
Talk to the girl while he's around
Watch will happen to you when she hear sound
Tell her shake it up, tell her hit the ground
Gonna FaceTime, see if she's down
She's a girl from the future
Says she's sick and tired of the old
So all that old shit can hit the road
Man, you only know if you know
'Cause she's...

[Chorus: Usher]
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing
What’s up with it?
Hot thing
What’s up with it? (oh, damn)
Hot thing
What’s up with it?
Hot thing (she's so bubblicious)
What’s up with it?

[Verse 2: Usher]
Seen her at Laser and she stopped and posed
When she see the green one, she just go, go, go
Like a stolen Bugatti, got money in your pocket
That makes you a Willy Parker pop up when he got a body
Talk to the girl while he's around
Watch will happen to you when she hear sound
Tell her shake it up, tell her hit the ground
Gonna FaceTime, see if she's down
She says you must have money in your wallet till the thing don't fold
Unless his credit card's black, not gold
Now you only know if you know
For real

[Chorus: Usher]
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing (she's a)
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing (she's a)
Hot thing
What’s up with it?
Hot thing
What’s up with it? (hot thing)
Hot thing
What’s up with it?
Hot thing (it's better when it's bubblicious)
What’s up with it?

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Fly, young hot thing, girl, let me cool off
GQ status went and fucked me with my suit on
She a fashion killer and you know I am a shoe hog
Christian Louis Vuitton red bottoms give me blue balls
She fuck me like she know me, then fuck me like she owe me
She told me, then she showed me, then she cuddled like she lonely
All for the love of the Holy Matrimony
But I'm pretty like Tony, and I'm pimping like Goldie
How you doing? I'm the motherfucking man
True hot boy, catch me running with the flame
She a hot girl, so she running with the name
Drop, drop it like it's hot, on my motherfucking thing
Mami like a lotta, Papi like the Murcielago
Grada, riding down Mercer
Go Nicki Minaj flow when I hit the verse-uh
If you let me menage, I'll take you to see Usher

[Bridge: Usher]
Talk to the girl while he's around (gotta talk to her, man)
Watch will happen to you when she hear sound (hey, when she hear that sound)
Tell her shake it up, tell her hit the ground (shake it up, let me see you drop down low)
Gonna FaceTime, see if she's down
She said, “It don’t really take too much to get me out of control
Maybe you the star, but this my show
Just take a little and I’m good to go"
Yeah, man
You fucking with a...

[Chorus: Usher]
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing (she's a hot thing)
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing
(I like them girls with the bubblicious without a man)
Hot thing
What’s up with it?
Hot thing
What’s up with it?
(Ain’t gotta have a lot just for me to hold on to fuck)
Hot thing
What’s up with it?
Hot thing
What’s up with it?

(He's a fake and he doesn't know the territory)
We going to bullshit most of the time
That's why niggas stay close to the 9

I never leave the pad without it
But best believe I can smash without it
See sticks and stones may not break your bones
But hollow points will definitely leave a hole in your dome
I'm and OG nigga and I'm holding my own
What's wrong?
(He's a fake and he doesn't know the territory)

[Interlude]
Check this out dog

You know what I'm saying?
But for you give me 5 G's and we cool

[Verse 3: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Straight up out the Garden B-L-O-C-C
Spiderman lyrical vitamin
Off wet and vicodin
Ready to push your cap backwards
Just like a bat catcher, body snatcher
You know I had to gat you
Leave you stiff as a statue
Gettin' at you
I act up
I'm loco
In the car there's a gun
In the dresser wit my loco homie
How could you not know
We pop those lead toes
Right out the window of the 64
????? there it goes
Coming to the west plus

We go as hard as a desert eagle
We make'em dead people me and SN
Double O-P
Trouble gone Be coming your way

Touch ya, gut ya and..

You don't want to know the rest it's a scary story
(He's a fake and he doesn't know the territory)

[Outro]
Yeah

West Coast

Taking no prisoners
Snoop Dogg Brotha Lynch Hung
You know what the fuck time it is nigga
Creep crawling on yall motherfucking ass

[Verse]
How the fuck he got an Oscar?
Passed out in his red Mazda
With his fucking head in his pasta
In the parking lot of Kmart plaza
'Cross from the Red Lobster
Looking like the Loch Ness Monster
Dressed like a cross-dressed mobster
Talk is cheap, it costs less to gossip
I'll prolly be a lot less hostile
If you snots kept your schnozzes out the air holes
You'll get fucked in all seven holes
Ass, mouth, pussy, yeah, both ears and, ha, yes, nostrils
At the OzzFest with Nas
Bumping Das EFX in a wrecked up Datsun
And dropped two extra strength Watson Vicodin out my pocket
They cost less
I'm a hot mess
'Cause I tripped and got my head stuck
In a wasps nest in the process, awesome
Drunk as fuck, one sock
Pulling my boxers up with boxing gloves
But I keep dropping my fucking binoculars
Got two fucking Hydroxycuts
And four oxi’s stuck in my esophogus
These three lesbian little stocky sluts
Thought I swallowed two hockey pucks
Started screaming "serves you right you cocky fuck
That's what you get for mocking us
Ain't as cool as you thought you was"
Bitch, all I did when I walked up was have my dick in a sock
Said it's a sock puppet
So no strings attached
You can all suck it
Chicka, get it, ah fuck it
Shit’s bout to get as hairy as motherfucking Chewbaca's nuts
Cocksuckers

[Chorus]
Yeah, I see you hatin' over there
See you jockin' over there, see you lookin' at my girl over here
Why you worried 'bout the girl over here?
Keep your eyes over there, it is creepy when you stare
Come on, hey, I see you hatin' over there
I see you jockin' over there, think about your own life
Why you talkin' 'bout the young hippy?
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know
And they think they know the deal, for real
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know
And they think they know the deal, for real
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, yo

[Verse]
I don't love who I am so I'm workin' on a fix
I don't need a bitch tryna tear my mind on my grip
If I had one wish, it'd be to have more wishes, duh
Fuck tryna make it rhyme
Throw them stones, with your bitch ass
Cutting me deep and even though I bleed
I stand alone, alone I'll be
Heart of a lion still shinin' in this sucka ass
Workin', workin', workin', for inner peace
Fightin' for the freedom of my soul, I can hear the speech
Yeah I mumble while I'm trippin on so many pills
Hah, they figured that they know a nigga

[Chorus]
Yeah, I see you hatin' over there
See you jockin' over there, see you lookin' at my girl over here
Why you worried 'bout the girl over here?
Keep your eyes over there, it is creepy when you stare
Come on, hey, I see you hatin' over there
I see you jockin' over there, think about your own life
Why you talkin' 'bout the young hippy?
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know
And they think they know the deal, for real
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know
And they think they know the deal, for real
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, yo

[Produced by Noah "40" Shebib and Omen]

[Verse 1]
When you give it all, you get it all
What happened to you, yeah
From the beginning, knew what I was getting But I was with it and I'll admit that
She was clear that once I got up in it
Wouldn't be easy for me to let it go
For my time, I got money, but money don't buy time
I got ahead, something got left behind
And the world is yours, just sign this dotted line
And in no time, I had

[Pre-Chorus]
Money, clothes, fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall
Seven Grammys, sold out concerts
Damn, I've been working hard
Private jets to France
Many women, I done had a ball
You can say I made it, but I'm faded

[Chorus]
'Cause I miss you, can we go back?
But the issue is time we can't get back
What happened to you, yeah?
Come back
'Cause I miss you, can we go back?
What happened to you?
I'm happy for you
What happened to you?

[Verse 2]
Did what I wanted, freaked all the honeys
I stayed on they mind, mind was on the money
Had whatever, whenever heartthrob forever
Black, young, and clever
When you give it all you get it all
Love would be the only reason to look, baby
But once you turn it on, you can't turn it off
But picture me complaining with all this

[Pre-Chorus]
Money, clothes, fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall
Seven Grammys, sold out concerts
Damn, I've been working hard
Private jets to France
Many women, I done had a ball
You can say I made it, but I'm faded

[Chorus]
'Cause I miss you, can we go back?
But the issue is time we can't get back
What happened to you, yeah?
Come back
'Cause I miss you, can we go back?
What happened to you?
I'm happy for you
What happened to you?

[Bridge]
What sense does it mean to have everything
And nothing at the same time?
Where are you?
I need you, yeah
I'm looking for you
Girl, come and share all this

[Pre-Chorus]
Money, clothes, fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall
Seven Grammys, sold out concerts
Damn, I've been working hard
Private jets to France
Many women, I done had a ball
You can say I made it, but I'm faded

[Chorus]
'Cause I miss you, can we go back?
But the issue is time we can't get back
What happened to you, yeah?
Come back
'Cause I miss you, can we go back?
What happened to you?
I'm happy for you
What happened to you?

[Outro]
Wherever you are
Things changing time
Wherever you are
Still the same old you
Wherever you are, girl
Wherever you are
I miss you

[Verse 1]
Now it was me and Lil CC and we was chilling by ourselves
Popped a pill and now I'm feeling myself
All these cuts on my wrist, it's like I'm killing myself
Diamond cuts is what I mean, I'm so hot I might melt
Only in your bitch mouth, nigga whatcha talking 'bout
You ain't talking 'bout shit if you ain't talking bout this
Don't worry 'bout me, worry bout my bitch
Don't worry 'bout me, worry bout my bitch

[Hook]
I got a bitch named Nina, and Nina's so slutty
Cause she'll do him and everyone of his buddies
Say, she'll do him and everyone of his buddies, yeah
She'll do him and everyone of his buddies
Protection off, safety - I look straight ahead
"I got them niggas Weezy", that's what the .380 said
"I got them niggas Weezy", that's what the .380 said
That's what the .380 said, that's what the .380 said

[Verse 2]
Man y'all ain't ready
I'll take one -- me and Lil Terry
And we hold court like Mason, Perry
Oops, I meant Perry Mason, the weed got me dyslexic
I’ve been hungry since I entered and I ain’t looking for an exit
Eat or get ate, and you looking like breakfast
You done took it too far, now don't stretch it
Damn, my bitch sexy and my bitch slutty
Cause she'll do him and everyone of his buddies, yeah
She'll do him and everyone of his buddies
Yeah, she'll do him and everyone of his buddies

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
In the back of the 'Bach
Its just me and my little brother, bitch
We call him Little Snack
Um, why we call him that?
Cause he like to eat snacks
And I like to eat rappers like he like to eat snacks
I call em emcee snacks
You emcees wack
How 'bout your funeral? Let me emcee that!
Three emcee facts:
My name's Dwayne Michael Carter, DMC's back!
Nigga walk this way
And I'm gonna paint your ass like an art display
I'm really rich, I just talk this way
And maybe if you get rich you'll talk this way!
See, right now I'm talking foreign, you dig? I'm talking foreign
Leave a hole in the boy big enough to park a car in
You're on, but you ain't on it, I'm more on like Warren
Move, boom! Now my bitch talking for me
Damn, and she's so slutty
Cause she'll do him and everyone of his buddies
Say, she'll do him and everyone of his buddies
Man, she'll do him and everyone of his buddies

[Verse 1: Bali]
Nigga this legendary, no ordinary shit
No ordinary bitches, no ordinary whips

Niggas eatin' on these beats get yourself a plate
And I'm a step away, one hit a breath away
When you don't got time, you ain't never late
Come so Victory is here we can celebrate

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Ok, I'm on my grizzle, on my grind
Go ahead try, top my shine

[Verse 3: BallGreezy]
Victory is on the way

You gotta best be sure that it go through
BallGreezy gettin' money like he 'posed to
Good dope in the drop like soul food
Big Body, big rims on the old school
Stay fly like a hood nigga 'posed too
Lights off, click clack in the pinto
Seat back, dick sucked in the Benzo
5% DBs on the Renzo
No sleep, gotta eat, gotta get done

[Verse 4: Iceberg]
It's like I always say motherfucker here I come
Another victory for the crib a couple more before I'm done
And if you asleep you better wake up
And get on your fucking job
Cause I'm taking everything except a loss Iceberg goes off
Yeah 24/7 I goes on and I be scared I might miss money, so I don't doze off

[Verse 5: Desloc]
Switch man been to official, I've been destined to shine
Won't take no for an answer, fuck nigga gimme mine
Never been selfish for real, I put on my whole city
I went from standing on corners to autographin' titties
My daddy gave my Virginia's King, A Richmond legend
A wise speaker, a woman pleaser, broke nigga, reverend
Mr O 10, I get it in, I wear the crown
We the best, tell 'em fuck next, I got downs

[Verse 6: Gunplay]
You got the cash? Then show me, better not be phoney
Get on my level cause they way below me
You ballin? Bologna. Girls ask me what my cologne is
Steel Khakis and Coronas and I'm mackin' a donkey
Flip the 4 and a half, do the vert and a left
Bet the ave never seen banks chunky as that
Why you got pressure? Cause my Impala got pressure
Beating outside, shaking the dice on my dresser. Is that Gunplay, Yes sir

[Hook: Kevin Cossom]
(Hey) You can look into my eyes

[Verse 7: Rum]
Yes, I'm on my way, all the way to the top, but I comin' from the bottom
You right here ain't go no brain, uh-uh, can't stop 'em
Headin' to the floor, I'm ridin'
Where the money keep most supplyin'
You can tell I'm stickin' like a muthafucker by the way I'm vibing
Just came back from where I was On my way somewhere else next
Lightening wrapped up in around my bankroll make my money spent
You can check up over here, check up over there Spent my hustle everywhere
I'm high-head grinding, getting it I'm everywhere, you're never there

[Verse 8: Young Cash]
It's Young Cash, I rap and I sing, nigga
Still a goon, I rap under you rappers for your chain, nigga
Fuck the alcohol, I'm the one they're playing, nigga
Black is the attire when I roll up with that thing, nigga
I'm riding flow, but I don't wanna move in quarter keys
I come from Texas, if you're Georgia just to fuck with me
Gimme your order, buy them more then, dog, I guarantee
That you gon' leave with some whitest lines ever released to T

[Verse 1]
I live a better life
Catch me out, Every night
Meet her once, Maybe Skype
Plus I only fuck them twice
Only rules that apply
We don’t cuff them, Let them fly
If she think there’s better things
That bitch in for a surprise
Light a candle, Prayer vigil
Another rapper dies
Trying to steal my flow
Must have thought I was blind
I see your videos
Youtube’n’ lil hoes
Bitch ain’t even Georgia code
That’s your girl, I ain’t know
Watching Belly on the iTunes
Niggas barely on iTunes
Only moment is if I’m featured on it
I heard his rumors when I’m in the room
Just cuz a man starving
Don’t mean he eat and drink the same water
Motha fuckas got social problems
Online got ya feeling brave, Don’t it
I’m paid homie
Fuck the myths, I’m the shit
Lyrical I can get
But what’s the sense
When it’s for cents, Double dollars
With a hit, stop the bull shit
No cows walking, But she stupid thick
Ass like a donkey, Shout out Wiz
But I don’t smoke
But you could still watch the Benz roll up, ho

[Hook]
Models on my phone
Super models at my show
Money on my mind at all times
And it’s time for more
Looking at my watch
Oh it’s the perpetual
Like what you see
But don’t touch it ho

[Bridge]
Rolli on my arm, what it cost man
New deposit came in, Another 100 grand
The end is near, The bible says it is
So I’ma rep Young Money till the fucking end

[Shortened hook]
Models on my phone
Super models at my show
Money on my mind
Oh it’s the perpetual
Don’t touch it ho

[Bridge]

[Extended hook]
Models on my phone
Super models at my show
Money on my mind at all times

Looking at my watch
Oh it’s the perpetual
Like what you see
But don’t touch it ho
But don’t touch it ho
But don’t touch it ho
But don’t touch it ho
Like what you see
But don’t touch it ho

[Hook]
I done put sticks in my bun
So they recognize me when I come
I'm DMC like run
Listen mammi I'm the muhfuckin one

You don't like me you just like my flow
Just booked a show but I might not go
Nigga said he didn't have a pole for my ho
Damn why a nigga tryna fuck up my dough?

They tell me to stop but I'm like hell no
Now everybody watch my M.O
Nicki been hot since you rock shell tops
Yessir

Ha ha ha ha
Gotta laugh at that
Bitch give me the ball I'm a pass it back
Spit nothin but crack got bags of that
When it come to rap I master that

[Hook] x2

You can spot me from a mile away
Nicki sexy any time of day
Word on the street is that I'm chinese
No lil mama I'm just high off haze

Don't fuck a dude if a dude don't pay
Don't suck a dude if a dude dirty
When it come to you gotta look purty
Sit up in the booth get your weave curly, hey

Sim simma
Pass me the keys to my beemer
Wish I had a booty like Trina
Nigga get your green up
Stay in the sky like Nina
Flights to Japan, Tiran and Korea

[Hook] x2

[Ad Libs]
I gotta laugh at these bitches
These bitches can't be serious!

[Verse 1]

[B.I.G.]
All it's takin'
Is some marijuana and I'm makin'
MC's break fast like flapjacks and bacon
Back spins to windmills. Who's still the gin drinker?
Ill thinker explodin' when the paper hits the ink
Grab your gangster chronicles and turn to page 6-6-6-
The holocaust, BIG the merciless
Hurry up and close the gate when my freestyle escapes
I'm giving young minds statutory rape
Mothafuckers thought I slip bust my lip, right?
You didn't know the extra clip's on my hip
You don't want none of me N-O-N-A-M-E-(T-H-O-D Man)
Don't tempt me, you don't wanna fuck with M-E

[Method Man]
Here I am, I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over hominy grit
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet black ninja
Comin' where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, youse the number one contender
Lookin' cold booty like your pussy in December
Nigga stop bitchin', button up ya lip and
From Method all you gettin' is a can of ass-whippin'
Hey, I'll be kickin', you son, you doin' all the yappin'
Actin as if it can't happen
You front and got me mad enough to touch somethin'
Yo I'm from Shaolin, Island, and ain't afraid to bust somethin'
So what cha' want nigga, ya won't nigga
I got a six-shooter and a horse named Trigger
It's real, ninety-four, rugged raw
Kickin' down your god damn door (and it goes a lil' somethin' like this)

[Chorus: Method Man & Biggie]
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it
(Honeys shake your hips), ya don't stop
(And niggas pack the clips), keep on

[Verse 2]

[Method Man]
Verse two, comin' with that Olde E brew
Meth-tical, puttin' niggas back in I.C.U
I'm lifted true, you can bring your wack-ass crew
I got connections, I'll get that ass stuck like glue, huh
No question, I be comin' down and shit
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfuckin' carpet get
And niggas love it, not in the physical form but in the mental
I spark and they cells get warm
I'm not a gentle, man, I'm a Method, Man!
Baby accept it, utmost respect it and
(Assume the position) Stop look and listen
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens
Bitch

[B.I.G.]
Welcome to my center
Honeys feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the winter
Ricochet off the vertebrae then splat where your heart be at
Now starts the cardiac arrest Where's your vest?
You forgot now you slowly drop cuz your heart stopped
Beaten, your bitch-ass crew is retreatin
Niggas left you, fucked up passed out with your ass out
Pockets ran through stripped with your brains bashed out
Niggas wanna do me slugs just run through me
Like trees to branches
Cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis
Deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfuckin' rap phenomenon, plus
(I got more Glocks and techs than you)
I make it hot (Niggas won't even stand next to you)
Nigga touch me you better bust me
Tree times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, ya thought so

[Chorus: Method Man & Biggie]
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it
(Honeys shake your hips), ya don't stop
(And niggas pack the clips), keep on
Motherfucker uh
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it
(Honeys shake your hips), ya don't stop
(And niggas pack the clips), keep on

Yea
Nappy Boy
FBI Man

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
From the second I was born I was in debt
Feel like I'm trying to fuck a bitch without a dick and she keep asking "Is it in yet?"
But then I gave the game a chin check
Told her sit your ass down and be happy I ain't fucking your friends yet
Hitting licks with a gun
Waving so many four-fives you'd think one of my hands was missin a thumb (Damn)
Got the whole industry on his knees
Record execs trying to steal my blow pop before I get to the gum
Uhh yea I'm everywhere that you won't be
So there's ain't no use trying that hating shit on me
Cause I'm gone speak, Nappy Boy everybody put your hands in teamwork on 3
Get to the money, hit the flea market and blow out
Something for your kids and niggas think you trying to show out
The only time I show out is when my record on replay
Hop out that Bugatti in some mother fucking PJ's
Bitch
Now who want it?

[Hook: Severe Da Young Drack]
Holy shit mother fucker god damn
That's what they say when they see me in my lam
I'm back in the streets and I'm bringing my fam
All of these wannabes know who I am
Haters got a problem with me and my man
But they get missing when its time to go ham
I'm on the grind and I won't stop for no man
Better get with the mother fucking program

[Verse 2]
I got bitches doing splits, hoes doing back bends
And niggas feeling awkward like a white dude with black friends
My Cadillac swims, Greg Louganis
If she ain't fucking me I kick her out quicker then Liu Kang (Whoo, Whoopsie!)
Do not fuck with him you don't want him
Cuz its a chance I might bust like and old condom
Yea, Its not as safe as you thought it was
My bass hit hard like it's a safe in my boxing glove (Boom!)
Uhh you should have got on and ran off
Jump out the window and pray to god you land soft
Keep talking shit and fuck around and piss my man off
And he gonna pull out something that can probably shoot your hand off
Thats hysteria having ?rigery? He getting shot in his frame I'm changing the scenery
He keep talking like he is that grown
And somebody gonna have to photoshop his limbs back on mother fucker
Yea, haha
Now who want it?

[Hook: Severe Da Young Drack]
Holy shit mother fucker god damn
That's what they say when they see me in my lam
I'm back in the streets and I'm bringing my fam
All of these wannabes know who I am
Haters got a problem with me and my man
But they get missing when its time to go ham
I'm on the grind and I won't stop for no man
Better get with the mother fucking program

[Verse 3]
3rd time Pizzle
Pardon my expression I'm just so disgusting
Bitches got me stressin' I sex em then fuck em
Then I make look to the music for a couple weeks
The say money talks come hear my Gucci duffles speak
But luckily, you niggas fuck with me
So I'mma auto-tune the whole world and take it up a key
I keep it snuck on me
Thats why your girls said she felt something else where my fucking belt buckle be
I'm too raw for the meat market
That's why it takes no time to get the beef started
Teddy Pain I'm harder then some fuckin Caridnals
They say I'm broke, bitch is you fucking retarded?
I'll turn your whole click into half a man
I drop bombs, these niggas think I'm from pakistan
He spitting fighting words, so we have to fight
But most of you pussies ain't worth dick, hermaphrodite
Shit, now who the fuck want it!?

[Hook: Severe Da Young Drack]
Holy shit mother fucker god damn
That's what they say when they see me in my lam
I'm back in the streets and I'm bringing my fam
All of these wannabes know who I am
Haters got a problem with me and my man
But they get missing when its time to go ham
I'm on the grind and I won't stop for no man
Better get with the mother fucking program

[Intro: Ninja & Yo-Landi Visser]
Baby's on fire!
Boom!
Boom boom!

[Verse 1: Yo-Landi Visser]
Showtime! Motherfucker, it's on
Apocalypse now, I'm dropping this bomb
You can't fuck with this song
I'll stick to this splif, I'm not klapping this bong
I'm a wild child, I don't wanna go to bed
Uh shit, sorry man, I'm stoned again
Wooh! Now everything's getting so psychedelic
When I'm doos dronk and I forget all my fokken lyrics
Like um... uh... who gives a fuck?
Don't worry 'bout it, just blow a kiss to me
I like danger, romance, and mystery
I'm a lucky ducky, get mad shit for free
I rock more bling than Mr. T
I make it look easy 'cause it is to me
My daddy says it's lekker fokken spif to see
A South African cherrie making history

[Pre-Hook: Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser]
Baby's on fire
She got me going fucking crazy, soos a mal naaier
Oh jirre! God se Jesus!
Baby's on fire
She got me going fucking crazy, soos a mal naaier

[Verse 2: Yo-Landi Visser]
H-H-H-H-Hi-Tek, drop that four to the floor
I get real paid, what you think I do this for?
My bodyguard help me get to the bar
Neill Blomkamp's making me a movie star
A lot of bad boys wanna piece of me
If you're lucky, boy, I'll let you sneak a peek
My zef style's motherfuckin' freaky-deak
I don't got beef 'cause I don't eat no meat
I'm on some other shit, yo, I know I speak unique
Fuck your whole shit up when I freak the beat
I love it when Kimmy talks sweet to me
C'mon, c'mon, Kimmy, Kimmy, speak to me
I take a trip down memory lane
Like, "Yo, fuck 15 seconds of fame"
I'm a young blood coming up fresh in the game
Yo-Landi Visser, motherfucker, yo remember the name

[Pre-Hook: Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser]
Baby's on fire
She got me going fucking crazy, soos a mal naaier

[Bridge: Yo-Landi Visser & Ninja]
Aaah, freak out!
No need to get so deep
Nothing quite like a motherfuckin' techno beat
A techno beat— a techno beat
A techno— a techno— a techno beat
Just say "what's up?", don't try to get so deep
You know me, maar ek ken jou nie
Ek ken jou nie, ek ken jou nie
Ek ken jou— ek ken jou— ek ken jou nie

[Pre-Hook: Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser]
Baby's on fire
Baby's on fire

[Intro]
Ah
Dressin' up, dressin' up, for you, for you
Dressin' up, dressin' up for you, for you
Ah

[Verse 1]
Saucer of milk (Saucer of milk), table for two
You wanna pet my kitty? You're such a dirty doggie
It’s your lucky night (Your lucky night), 'cause I'm in the mood
Oh, I'm feeling spicy, I'm feeling real naughty

[Refrain]
Pick a part, you dream it up
A dark vixen, a Lolita
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy
Tonight's the night, I'm dressin' up for you

[Verse 2]
I can tell you're obsessed (Tell you're obsessed)
By your shortness of breath
Ooh, my Cookie Monster wants a taste test
Be a good boy and I'll show you the rest
Ooh, my little voyeur wants to play explorer

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Pick a part, you dream it up
Librarian, dominatrix
Oh boy, tell me your fantasy
Tonight's the night (Tonight's the night)

[Chorus]
Tonight I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night I'm dressin' up for you
(Dressin' up)

[Verse 3]
You're getting hot, so let's call the nurse
Ooh, I feel a fever, let's take your temperature
Better behave or a police officer
Will have to hold you down, give you what you deserve

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Pick a part, you dream it up
Use your imagination
Oh boy, I'll be your fantasy
Tonight's the night (Tonight's the night)

[Chorus]
Tonight I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night, I'm dressin' up for you
Tonight, I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night, I'm dressin' up for you

[Bridge]
Tied tight, tip, teasing
Push, pull, pressure, pleasing
Beads of sweat drip down your neck
Breathing deep, gaining speed, 'bout to peak
Trembling, trembling, trembling

[Chorus]
Tonight I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night, I'm dressin' up for you
Tonight, I'm gonna come alive
Make you forget about your nine-to-five
Are you ready for your blood to rise?
Tonight's the night, I'm dressin' up for you (Oh)

[Outro]
(Dressin' up)
I'm dressin' up for you (Oh, yeah)
I'm dressin' up, I'm dressin' up, I'm dressin' up, I'm dressin' up
I'm dressin' up for you (Oh)
I'm dressin' up, I'm dressin' up for you

[Part I]

[Refrain]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Set the cheetahs on the loose
Oh, oh, oh, oh
There's a thief out on the move
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Underneath our legion's view
Oh, oh, oh, oh
They have taken Cleopatra

[Bridge]
Run run run, come back for my glory (Cleopatra)
Bring her back to me (Cleopatra)
Run run run, the crown of our pharaoh (Cleopatra)
The throne of our queen is empty (Cleopatra)

[Verse 1]
We'll run to the future, shining like diamonds
In a rocky world, rocky-rocky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to the rhythm on the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramids tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids, voices fill up the halls

[Refrain]
Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra

[Verse 2]
The jewel of Africa, jewel
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
How could you run off on me? How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson and his full head of hair
I found my black queen Cleopatra, bad dreams, Cleopatra

[Outro]
Remove her, send the cheetahs to the tomb
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom
No more, she lives no more, serpent in her room
No more, he has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra

[Part II]

[Segue]
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl
For now, let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra
I watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
Then your six-inch heels, catch her
She's headed to the pyramid

[Chorus]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight

[Verse 1]
Pimping in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne, let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite twisting my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank but it still got woodgrain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid
That keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid
Keep a nigga bills paid

[Chorus]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid

[Verse 2]
You showed up after work, I'm bathing your body
Touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go?
The way you say my name makes me feel like
I'm that nigga but I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it, ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more, baby
But your love ain't free no more

[Chorus]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, that's right
Working at the pyramid tonight, yeah
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight

[Guitar Solo: John Mayer]

[Verse 1]
I could liken you to a werewolf the way you left me for dead
But I admit that I provided a full moon
And I could liken you to a shark the way you bit off my head
But then again I was waving around a bleeding open wound

[Chorus]
But you are such a super guy ’til the second you get a whiff of me
We’re like a wishing well and a bolt of electricity
But we can still support each other, all we gotta do is avoid each other
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key

[Bridge]
The lava of a volcano shot up hot from under the sea
One thing leads to another and you made an island of me

[Verse 2]
And I could liken you to a chemical the way you made me compound a compound
But I'm a chemical, too
Inevitable you and me would mix
And I could liken you to a lot of things but I always come around
‘cause in the end I’m a sensible girl
I know the fiction of the fix

[Chorus]
But you are such a super guy ’til the second you get a whiff of me
We are like a wishing well and a bolt of electricity
But we can still support each other, all we gotta do’s avoid each other
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key
"Uh, funky baby
Lay it on me now
Not so hard, man"

Yo…
I've got Chinese eyes and Chinese suits (Lay it on me now)
Smokin' much Buddha and smokin' much boots
More updated on the hip-hop lingo (Not so hard, man)
My favorite New York Knick was Harthorne Wingo
Met a girl at a party, and I gave her my card
Man, you know that it said Napoleon Bonaparte (Lay it on me now)
Peepin' out the colors, I be buggin' on Cezanne
They call me Mike D, Joe Blow, the Lover Man
Well, your face turns red as your glass of wine
That you spilled on my lyrics as you wasted my time (Lay it on me now)
Girl, you should be with me, you should drop that bum
'Cause I got more flavor than Fruit Stripe Gum
With that big round butt of yours
I'd like to butter your muffin--I'm not bluffin'
Serve you on a platter like Thanksgiving stuffin'
("And what it")
Stuffing, stuffing
Stuff it, buddy

[Verse 1]
Street niggas, hood rats, ladies and gentlemen
Childish Gambino greater than sign everyone
Apples to oranges, Jay Leno to Letterman
Got a cool whip and my girl ass gelatin
"Fake niggas back in style" naw never that
If I'm wrong, see you in hell with hella cash
God dammit we the boys with the illest rain
Royalty forever and the rest is just a silly game
Still wonderin' how to work your girlfriend's genitals
Still makin' money off of 30 Rock residuals
Money changes everything, these girls are always down to ride
Especially if you keep they noses gentrified
Money off of curse words, I hope my momma proud of me
Man I done it all, so I guess we both prodigies
From PJs to PJs, that's projects to privates
Now you understand my fuckin' mindset, let 'em know

[Intro: Ninja]
Yo Hi-Tek
Let's fuck around with some of that ol' feel good gangsta shit

[Hook: Ninja]
I been rapping for 20 fucking years
Whole lot of fucking blood sweat and tears
Who cares they don't give a fuck
On the mic I'm taking no prisoners

[Post-Hook: Yo-Landi Vi$$er]
Check me out now... yo yo!
So what I'm only up an' coming in the game?
So what I'm in it for the cash, money and the fame?
So what I'm better than you and it's fucking up your brain?
Yo-Landi Vi$$er is the shit up in this bitch!

[Verse 1: Ninja & Yo-Landi]
I rapped for 20 years, never made a cent (shame)
Borrowed money from my mom to pay the rent
Now how'm I gonna get out this mess?
Yo-Landi shows me two stripes on the fokken piss test (Oh fuck)
Broke ass Ninja gonna be a daddy (Yeah)
Little baby Ninja gonna need some nappies
Gave it my best shot, never pressed stop
Thank god Die moederfokken Antwoord went pop (Oh!)

[Verse 2: Yo-Landi & Ninja]
Got a million fucking dollars in the bank (Woah)
Then I converted all my dollars into rands (Ching-ching)
That equals seven million rands in the bank
Not too shitty, fuck you Jimmy, I'ma never give it back! (Never)
Don't worry Ninji, yo I'm gonna make you proud
I'm here to work, I'm not here to fuck around (Is ja)
I'm your special little cherrie on the top
I keep it very fuckin' hot indeed I'm never gonna flop

[Hook: Ninja]
I been rapping for 20 fucking years
Whole lot of fucking blood sweat and tears
Who cares they don't give a fuck
On the mic I'm taking no prisoners

[Post-Hook: Yo-Landi]
Kykie! Uh
So what I fly 'round the whole world getting paid?
So what I smoke weed all day every day?
So what I tell truth even when I tell a lie?
I get very red in the eye when I'm getting high

[Verse 3: Ninja & Yo-Landi]
I got a record deal in the overseas (Really?)
So excited that I couldn't go to sleep (Hosh!)
They wanted my soul so I sold it for a fee
When they dropped the album everyone downloaded it for free
In da overseas they think I'm the shizzle
In South Africa they think I'm a criminal
"Little girl show me your ID"
I don't like the drugs but the drugs sure like me!
Ninja fuckin' ugly on the skin
But Ninja very lovely from within
I'm serious but also need a bit of fun
Ninja likes the girls who let him stick his penis up their bum
Ek gooi n fokken 27 innie lug (Hosh!)
Ek slat jou met my fokken piel in jou gesig (Sies!)
I'm da fuckin' ultimate I can't lose
Klap n vet moerrefokken zol, nou's jy confused!

[Hook: Ninja]
I been rapping for 20 fucking years
Whole lot of fucking blood sweat and tears
Who cares they don't give a fuck
On the mic I'm taking no prisoners

[Post-Hook: Yo-Landi]
So what my teachers at school told me I would never hack it?
So what I'm like a full-blown marijuana addict?
So what I'm like da freshest fokken rapper on da planet?
It's a Afrikan thing you wouldn't understand it! (Never)

[Verse 4: Ninja & Yo-Landi]
You're chilling in your room bored all alone (Uh)
Now you're flipping through porn on your phone
You start jerking off, 'bout to bust a nut
When your mom walks in the room, Jesus what da fuck? (Ag sies)
Life is crazy, yo it doesn't make sense (No)
I'm here to make money, not to make friends
I used to hustle like a fokken dwankie to pay the rent
Nowadays when I check my balance at the ATM I go...
Oh my god! Oh, oh my god!
Oh my god! Oh, oh my god!
Oh my god! Oh, oh my god!
(Geld my boetie)

[Outro: Yo-Landi & Ninja]

Little kid with guns, only fifteen, roaming the streets, up to no good
When gun shots just bust, just run quickly, I could show you where (Show you where)

[Pre-Chorus]
As long you're with me, baby, you'll be alright (Come on)

Shorty, come with me, it's no worries, I know the bad mandem where I stay

Don't be scared, I know the West Indies, it's Jamaica, that's where I'm from
Might see something that you're not used to, welcome to the slums (To the slums)

[Pre-Chorus]
As long you're with me, baby, you'll be alright

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah nigga, I only fuck with a certain type of niggas man
One hundred, ayy Drew put some delay on my voice
Put some reverb on there and turn me up, uh

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Niggas got it fucked up
Probably thinking its a game
I might smile a lot
But I ain't playing with 'em
I'm up at eight, I work all night
I'm rolling weed, I'm on the flight
Soon as I land I'm gonna write
I'm on the grind
40 hours, 2 shows, 3 planes, 6 zeros
Flying all around the world
Like I'm a fucking hero
Pouring it straight out a bottle
That's how we drink Cliquot
And we all from the same hood
That's why we feel the same thing
Like say if one of our pockets hurting
We all gon' feel the same pain
Always smoking out the car service
Police escorting, not at all nervous
We the bomb, search us
Penthouse, whole room filled with cash in it
Old school backseat, with the stash in it
Big joint, OG mixed with hash in it
And it's TGOD, you niggas last minute
Your flow last year, the swag last fall
You just the last place, you ain't gon' last at all

[Chorus]
You niggas want kush, we got ounces
You niggas want cookies, we got pounds
You niggas want kush, we got ounces
You niggas want cookies, we got pounds

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
You know its Taylor Gang or die
Haha, word

Ah, fresh out the spot where they selling
You gotta pay 'em to cook
Ain't no rules out this motherfucker
Who sold you that book
Bitch we down when its cracking
Around my way and you know that
Can get more than I ever asked
So be afraid of the go back
Hear them talking, I'm cool and moving
No cameras, respect the shooters
I'm out on this money train
You don't know about hustle, do you?
It's everything in or nothing
Bitch you know how I get down
You wasn't mad at me before
So why is you mad at me now?
The alcohol got you talking
You do the same thing, and the cops
Know conversation, know where we playing
Only for money calls only
That mean I can't deal with them old games
That you trynna kick, this ain't Shinobi
I told her baby you thirsty
She responded I'm cool
Said your wrist, its got water
I told her bitch this a pool
Feel me gang that, or concrete dive head first
But if you owe me money, I need my bread first

[Chorus]
You niggas want kush, we got ounces
You niggas want cookies, we got pounds
You niggas want kush, we got ounces
You niggas want cookies, we got pounds

[Verse 3: Berner]
What you smoking on man? Aha
What you got in your bag though bruh?

The same shit, new bitch with me
Buy 20, run through 50
I'm running through the stop lights, late night
I told baby girl get your cake right
That kush doesn't taste right
You take it to the head
All you smell is KK and cookie smoke in the Benz
Where my roof go, I stack up quick, while they move slow
White girls in my room, I'm smoking while they do blow
Plush life, no crushed ice
I'm 20k in the game, my bookie loves life
But fuck it, I like to blow cash
I don't tuck it, its nothing
Two first class flights to the function
20 zans, 120 grand, in the city where the pretty girls dance
And them plants grow, in the warehouse
Skinny cash, if you pass me bullshit, I'mma laugh
I'm the man, no lie baby

[Chorus]
You niggas want kush, we got ounces
You niggas want cookies, we got pounds
You niggas want kush, we got ounces
You niggas want cookies, we got pounds

[Verse 1]
The breath of the morning I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement
Up above aliens hover
Making home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets

[Chorus]
They're all uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight

[Verse 2]
I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it
I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
They'd shut me away but I'd be alright, alright
Mom, I'm alright, alright

[Chorus]
I'm just uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight

[Skit: Paul Rosenberg]
Em? It's Paul
Ah, I just listened to the entire album
You gotta be fucking kidding me
I mean with this Christopher Reeves shit?
You know the guy's dead, right?
And then the whole gay stepfather incest rape thing?
I don't have your back on this one
I can't even fuckin' handle it, I'm done

[Verse 1]
Telling me I’m the only one that you’ll love, boo
Baby, it's okay
If you let me stay
I won't love any other girl the way I love you
Baby girl just stay
I'mma take the pain away

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll make you believe that no one can do, when we do it
Show you that I know what I'm doing too, I'll prove

[Chorus]
Baby, there's no love like our love
Baby, this our place, lemme kiss your face 'cause
Baby, there's no love like our love
Baby, I'm your man, just take my hand, girl
Our love, our love, our love, our love
Our love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Our love, our love, our love, our love
Our love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love

[Verse 2]
Baby hold me, kiss me, I'ma kiss and hold you
Because all the pace
We don't gotta race
Never thought I'd be the one you'd want to
Give away your heart
Gotta do my part now

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll make you believe that no one can do, when we do it
Show you that I know what I'm doing too, I'll prove

[Chorus]
Baby, there's no love like our love
Baby, this our place, lemme kiss your face 'cause
Baby, there's no love like our love
Baby, I'm your man, just take my hand, girl
Our love, our love, our love, our love
Our love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Our love, our love, our love, our love
Our love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love

[Break]
Break it baby, break it baby, it it it it down
Break it baby, break it baby, it it it it down (It down)
Break it down, break it down, break it down

[Chorus]
Baby, there's no love like our love
Baby, this our place, lemme kiss your face 'cause
Baby, there's no love like our love
Baby, I'm your man, just take my hand, girl
Our love, our love, our love, our love

Our love, our love, our love, our love
Our love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Our love, our love, our love, our love
Our love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love

[Intro]
Mustard on the beat ho!

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Trap pussy, fuck her in a black hoodie
Fucking in the house, while Momma cookin
Them tacos, bitch I need two mo'
Knock the pussy out the park; Pujols
Ass Sumo, all gold two door
Bitches wanna have my baby, but this ain't Juno
You know, I got the ratchet on me cause I'm too on
Know where I'm from streets getting hotter than Tucson (Augh!)
Rachet City, welcome to the real 50's
Creased Dickies, nigga don't be conversing with me
Brought the silks out niggas say I'm looking Biggie
Pussy ain't shit, but the hoes will make me richer
Shh, ha, money in the mattress
Now it's money in the mansion, I'm throwing money she dancing
I'm a motherfuckin G, hella path for a bachelor
Ratchet, hating niggas hacking
Tell me where the...

[Hook]
Where the ballers at, ask me where the ballers at
Hut one, hut two, im the quarter back
Fuck a pretty bitch gotta let you have it
I don't do this for the motherfucking rapping
I do this for the ratchets
I do it for the ratchets
I do it for the ratchets
I do it for the ratchets

[Verse 2: Joe Moses]
Verse two, sadity man I hate those
Go bowling in her pussy, A-hole
Nice face but her ass like play dough
Charge on the mouth with my dick; Diego
Knock it off knock it in then knock it down
Mayweather with the ratchets, knock 'em out
Said her last nigga weird, Pacquiao
Left her in the studio, ass up face down
Pretty bitches gon' hate, we don’t need that
Where the ratchets at? Tell me where the ratchets at
Shake your ass to the beat then bring it back
Mills said bleed, driver can you handle that?

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you, you say, "Who is that man?"
You try so hard
But you don't understand
Just what you will say
When you get home

[Refrain]
Because something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 2]
You raise up your head
And you ask, "Is this where it is?"
And somebody points to you and says
"It's his"
And you say, "What's mine?"
And somebody else says, "Well, what is?"
And you say, "Oh my God, am I here all alone?"

[Refrain]
But something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 3]
You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says, "How does it feel to
Be such a freak?"
And you say, "Impossible"
As he hands you a bone

[Refrain]
And something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 4]
You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To all give a check
To tax-deductible charity organization
Aw, you've been with the professors
And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You are very well read
It's well known

[Refrain]
But something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 5]
Well the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, "Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan"

[Refrain]
And something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 6]
Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word "Now"
And you say, "For what reason?"
And he says, "How?"
And you say, "What does this mean?"
And he screams back "You're a cow
Give me some milk or else go home"

[Refrain]
And you know something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

[Verse 7]
Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There oughtta be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones

[Refrain]
'Cause something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
Intro:
Stepping to the bad side (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Gonna take a mean ride (ooh, ooh, ooh)
The smile I had has gone away
Those that steal are gonna pay
Stepping to the bad side today

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Real nigga, I just can't be fake
Fake niggas they just can't be real
Hot boy I just can’t be chilled
So hot I'm a walking kettle
Man these boys can’t get on my level, they never could
All white phantom directing it through the hood
Real soft leather my dash is cherry wood
Big four 5th that’s working very good
Got a driver named Wood-row
Opens the door, Sui - ci - dal
He holds the umbrella, I hops outta the back
And tell Rosa Parks it’s where I sat
I'm a dog but I'm like a cat to a rat
If he don’t run he get scratched Rrrrraaaaooo
And when it comes to the 4 stain
I'm like old school Harlem shit, that Rich Port thang
I gave him narc
I gave him crack
Now it’s time to introduce him to morphine
You're playing with the wrong one
My mama had 4 boys, you're playing with the wrong son
They say Ladies Love Cool J
Well the J is for Juelz and the ladies love me
And if the bitch ain’t fine
I don’t mind
2 nickels make a dime every time
These boys acting like worthless hoes
But their career is like the car they be in, the curtains closed
They want war let’s get it now
They want beef I give them a cow
You don’t wanna get on my bad side
I leave them with no neck like fat guys
Don’t be playing with me, I ad-vise
I make them Chinese food, another cat fried
And don’t compare them to me there is no comparison
I'm from another planet like aliens
Shark In The Water, there is no scaring them
These fish belong in aquariums
So keep acting like Conan boy and we will see who is the real barbarian
They acting like bad pets and yes I'm a veterinarian
You don’t wanna see me act mean
And don’t watch me I'm not a flat screen
I'm Pay-Per-View you know what that means
You gotta pay for this BITCH!!

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Let’s Go
Hard body I can’t even bend
Nor fold I'm cold like the wind
Or North Pole I froze all my limbs
Too much ice I'm a walking bezzle
That’s why you niggas couldn’t get on my level and never could
All Black Phantom directing it through the hood
Black butter soft my dash is black too
My driver is black too
My driver is strapped too
Lil Wayne I'm live as Act 2
But this is no movie script
More like an Uzi clip
I'm into Uzi clips
Spit like an Uzi
I spit like I just jumped into Uzi clips
Nigga who is you with
I can move your clique
All I got to do is let loose with this Uzi clip
I'm an Uzi bitch
Know the rules and shit around here we wear red like a Hoosier bitch
Now after that there comes a smell
And after that welcome to hell
I hope your situation comes to well
Cause I will bust your ass like a lobster tail
I put it into her mouth like Akinyele
And me I get high like a doctor bill
So I sha – ll
Fuss with the kitchen, telling me he ain’t got no pot to sell
17th ward is where I prevail
And I run them streets like a soccer field
You looking at hot for real
And I'm rolling on this bitch like I popped a pill
And I don’t mean David, when I say it, when it comes to marijuana I will cop a field
Just tryna get my proper meal and eat my shit at the top of the hill
That’s the good side
Never look back it’s ya bad side
You on the bad side
Hey, and you don’t wanna see my bad side
You would wanna be my ally
And I believe that I can fly
Not like R.Kelly, he a damn lie
Weezy
Write it in the sand, I hope the wind doesn’t blow for eternity

[Intro]
Ali, mix it
Ha ha ha, Lady G, Whaddup?
Ha ha ha, Bad Love, Whaddup?
Ha ha ha, ha...

[Verse 1]
I spaz out 'til I pass out
There’s clarity in my vulgarity for a sass-mouth
Your parody’s not funny
Apparently you ain't nothing but industry crash dummies
As long as the lord love me, I’m good
I could: be the best rapper but I’d rather be the answer that capture the violence that coincides in my hood
I should: stick a fork in this music business
But I’m too deep in it like pussy on my penis
Devil’s kitchen in Phoenix; that’s the heat that I’m bringing where the shade at?
I’m L.A. radio and good music, boy, I don’t play that
Ugh, Walking a thin line from thinking like Einstein
And rhyming like Rakim in ’89
Don’t wanna pack a nine just a mind full of wisdom
Like a man 99 years old locked in prison
Don’t freeload on my vision
Get exposed like an R&B ho with a sex tape hidden
I’m always for the business, forever you can feel it
Whether you Crip blue or a nigga that hemorrhage
My penmanship is like me and Langston combined to the hip
And my hip to the hop don’t stop as I rock
I got a buzz like a shot of Palmer Sun
And the women fall in love as they fall in my crotch
Now understand that I’m all that you’ve got
Give me chance, give me ears, give me hearts, give me props
Hear the difference? I’m cool like that
Oh, you spit? Well the retarded drool is back
See, I’m the author of the authors, the father of the Austin Power fajja
Who can bust like a charter, why bother?
I know a jealous serpent is a burden to my life
But still I carry on like luggage on a flight
The realness in my bones is the DNA to life
I can give you insight only if you’re in sight
I’m looking past y’all like a fastball - strike!
And I ain't even tryna give it my all - yikes!
I’m comfortable enough to go and chill out with a Huxtable
You couldn’t see my pedestal, because you’re afraid of heights
Cloud 9, where you can find
Me in my dime like Roosevelt in his prime
Wait 'til I’m in my prime
The moon and the stars will align on my Louis V. belt like Orion
To whom say he cool: but the irony is I could hold the bottom of an iron with the bottom of my palm
I say so much, so little all action, no talk like a mime throwing up gang signs
It’s not all about punchlines, I don’t do that
I’m a Jaguar; you’re just a new cat, now move back
Kendrick Lamar on the radar for success
Aiming for the top like an AR aimed at your neck
I can never digress, ‘less I get demoted to death
Even then I’ll be the best still, like a petty theft
I will: conquer my biggest dreams
Once you open the cage, I bet that I’ll spread my wings
Nipsy got street cred, Jay Rock got street cred
And all I got is bad credit, big ears and big head
But still they’ll feel me, cause we all ate cereal
Humped our momma's friend's daughter while they bump the stereo
Backflips on shopping carts, free lunch at the park
Watched Power Rangers after school; here we go
I’m so Comptonized, I will never compromise
For no faulty ass A&R or CEO
We ain't what you think and you think we’re back
But we’ve been here for decades, and I vouch for that
Open your mouth for that, speak well like a great debater over iChat
Get your other eye cracked
I don’t rap, I-Iraq and declare war
I enjoy watching enemies' blood pour
I came up lower middle class, not poor
So don’t feel sorry for me, I don’t need y’all to love me
I need y’all to feel me
And if you feeling froggy to leap, then feel free
My feeling’s all aside, my pride is deprived
By the ultimate prize I'mma get when I see your suicide

[Verse 1]
You didn't see my valentine
I sent it via pantomime
While you were watching someone else
I stared at you and cut myself
That's all I'll do cause I'm not free
A fugitive too dull to flee
I'm amorous but out of reach
A still life drawing of a peach

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a tulip in a cup
I stand no chance of growing up
I've made my peace, I'm dead, I'm done
I watch you live to have my fun

[Chorus]
I root for you, I love you
You you you you
I root for you, I love you
You you you you

[Verse 2]
I made it to a dinner date
My teardrops seasoned every plate
I tried to dance but lost my nerve
I cramped up in the learning curve

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a tulip in a cup
I stand no chance of growing up
I'm resigned to sail on through
In the wake of tales of you

[Chorus]
I root for you, I love you
You you you you
I root for you, I love you
You you you
I root for you, I love you
You you you, you you you you
I root for you, I love you
You you you

[Intro]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Imagine I'm in love with you
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many, many, many times before

[Chorus]
It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I think about you night and day
I need you and it's true
When I think about you, I can say
I'm never, never, never, never blue

[Chorus]
So I'm telling you, my friend
That I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Bridge]
Well, there's gonna be a time
When I'm gonna change your mind (When I'm gonna make you mine)
So you might as well resign yourself to me, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Imagine I'm in love with you
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many, many, many times before

[Chorus]
It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Woah yeah

[Verse 1]
I guess I just must be a daredevil
I don't feel anything until I smash it up
I'm caught on the cold, I'm caught on the hot, not so with the warmer lot
And all I want's a confidante to help me laugh it off

[Chorus]
And don't let me ruin me
I may need a chaperone

[Verse 2]
Say I'm an airplane and the gashes I got from my heartbreak
Make the slots and the flaps upon my wing, and I use them to give me a lift
Hip hip for the lift, hip hip for the drag, I want them all in my bag
Oh, give me anything, and I'll turn it into a gift

[Chorus]
But don't let me ruin me
I may need a chaperone

[Bridge]
Seek me out, look at, look at, look at
Look at me, I'm all the fishes in the sea
Wake me up, give me, give me, give me what you got
In your mind, in the middle of the night

[Verse 3]
Maybe you let me look out for you
Protect what I found in you and never let it starve
Then that way, you let me stay, skirtin' the skirt like I want to
And I will try hard to hold onto you with open arms

[Chorus]
But don't let me ruin me
I may need a chaperone

[Verse 1]
Jonathan, call again
Take me to Coney Island
Take me on the train
Kiss me while I calculate
And calibrate and heaven's sakes
Don't make me explain

[Chorus]
Just tolerate my little fist
Tugging on your forest chest
I don't wanna talk about
I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't wanna talk about
I don't wanna talk about anything

[Verse 2]
Jonathan, anything
And anyone you have done
Has gotta be alright with me
If she's part of the reason
You are how you are
She's alright with me

[Chorus]
Just tolerate my little fist
Tugging on your forest chest
I don't wanna talk about
I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't wanna talk about
I don't wanna talk about anything

[Bridge]
You'd like to captain a capsized ship
But I like watching you live
You'd like to captain a capsized ship
But I like watching you live

[Verse 3]
Jonathan, call again
Take me to Coney Island
Take me on the train
Kiss me while I calculate
And calibrate and heaven's sakes
Don't make me explain

[Chorus]
Just tolerate my little fist
Tugging on your forest chest
I don't wanna talk about
I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't wanna talk about
I don't wanna talk about anything

[Verse 1]
You made your major overtures
When you were a sure and orotund mutt
And I was still a dewey petal
Rather than a moribund slut
My love wrecked you
You packed to twirl your skirt at the palace
It hurt more than it ought to hurt
I went to work to cultivate a callus

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I'm hard, too hard to know
I don't cry when I'm sad anymore, no no
Tears calcify in my tummy
Fears coincide with the tow

[Chorus]
How can I ask anyone to love me
When all I do is beg to be left alone?

[Verse 2]
Oh, when I try to love
And I can love the same man in the same bed in the same city
But not in the same room, it's a pity, but
Oh, it never bothered me before
Not 'til this guy, what a guy, oh God what a good guy
And I can't even enjoy him

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm hard, too hard to know
I don't cry when I'm sad anymore, no no
Tears calcify in my tummy
Fears coincide with the tow

[Chorus]
How can I ask anyone to love me
When all I do is beg to be left
When all I do is beg to be left
When all I do is beg to be left
Alone?
Alone?
Alone?

[Verse 3]
My ills are reticulate
My woes are granular
The ants weigh more than the elephants
Nothing, nothing is manageable
So couldn't we skip the valedictories?
I can see a door there
Shut it and forget my number

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm hard, too hard to know
I don't cry when I'm sad anymore, no no
Tears calcify in my tummy
Fears coincide with the tow

[Chorus]
How can I ask anyone to love me
When all I do is beg to be left
When all I do is beg to be left
When all I do is beg to be left alone?

[Verse 1]
Oh, the periphery
They throw good parties there
Those peripheral idiots
Always have a bite to bear
Bear it, if you can
If you really want to

[Verse 2]
Go to the periphery
Have them celebrate your name
Have them forge you a pedigree and then you'll be
Left to run the races, lame
Run it if you want
If you think it’s worth it
But not with me

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't appreciate
People who don't appreciate
All that loving must've been lackin' something
If I got bored tryin' to figure you out
You let me down
I don't even like you anymore at all

[Verse 3]
Oh, the periphery
I lost another one there
He found a prettier girl than me
With a more even-tempered air
And if he wants her, he should get her
'Cause I think he thinks she's worth it
And maybe they'll move from the periphery
Buy themselves their own plot of land
And I'll care in a different capacity, I'll just be
Hoping he makes a good family man
And if he finds himself yearning
For his throne on the silly side
There's nothing wrong, as long as he's learning
Besides, he can take it up with his bretheren
Or with his bride, just not with me

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't appreciate
People who don't appreciate
All that loving must've been lacking something
If I got bored tryin' to figure you out
You let me down
I don't even like you anymore at all
'Cause I don't appreciate
People who don't appreciate
All that loving must've been lacking something
If I got bored tryin' to figure you out
You let me down
I don't even like you anymore at all

[Outro]
Oh, the periphery
Oh, the periphery
Oh, the periphery
Oh, the periphery
Stole you away
Stole you away
Away, away
Stole you away, away

[Verse 1]
'Member when we argued o'er the concept of regret?
You were an expert even then but not me, not yet
Now all you gotta do's remind me that we met
And there you got me, that's how you got me, you taught me to regret

[Verse 2]
'Member how I asked you why are you so mean?
You didn't know how to react to being seen
I tried to be your friend, you made me shamed so I'm getting e'en
And there you got me, that's how you got me, you taught me to be mean

[Chorus]
But I ran out of white doves' feathers
To soak up the hot piss that comes from your mouth
Every time you address me
Oh, I ran out of white doves' feathers
To soak up the hot piss that comes from your mouth
Every time you address me

[Verse 3]
'Member when I was so sick and you didn't believe me?
Then you got sick too and guess who took care of you?
You hated that, didn't you? Didn't you?
Now when you look at me, you're condemned to see
The monster your mother made you to be
And there you got me, that's how you got free
You got rid of me

[Chorus]
But now I ran out of white doves' feathers
To soak up the hot piss that comes from your mouth
Every time you address me
Oh, I ran out of white doves' feathers
To soak up the hot piss that comes from your mouth
Every time you address me

[Outro]
Alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Alone

[Apple]

[Apple & Maggart]
Maybe he could teach me something
(If I'm butter, if I'm butter)
(I'm a hot knife, I'm a hot knife)
Maybe I could teach him too
(If I'm butter then he's a hot knife)
(I'm a hot knife, he's a pat of butter)
Even just to reach is a triumph
(He makes my heart a cinemascope screen)
(If I get a chance, I’m gonna show him that)
Now I really got a hold on you
(Showing a dancing bird of paradise)
(He’s never gonna need another, never need another)
Maybe he could teach me something
(If I'm butter, if I'm butter)
(I'm a hot knife, I'm a hot knife)
Maybe I could teach him too
(If I'm butter then he's a hot knife)
(I'm a hot knife, he's a pat of butter)
Even just to reach is a triumph
(He makes my heart a cinemascope screen)
(If I get a chance, I’m gonna show him that)
Now I really got a hold on you
(Showing a dancing bird of paradise)
(He’s never gonna need another, never need another)

[Apple & Maggart]
Maybe he could teach me something
(If I'm butter, if I'm butter)
(And you can, and you can)
(I'm a hot knife, I'm a hot knife)
Maybe I could teach him too
(If I'm butter then he's a hot knife)
(And you can relax around me)
(I'm a hot knife, he's a pat of butter)
Even just to reach is a triumph
(He makes my heart a cinemascope screen)
(And you can, and you can)
(If I get a chance, I’m gonna show him that)
Now I really got a hold on you
(Showing a dancing bird of paradise)
(And you can relax around me)
(He’s never gonna need another, never need another)
Maybe he could teach me something
(If I'm butter, if I'm butter)
(And you can, and you can)
(I'm a hot knife, I'm a hot knife)
Maybe I could teach him too
(If I'm butter then he's a hot knife)

(I'm a hot knife, he's a pat of butter)
Even just to reach is a triumph

Now I really got a hold on you
(Showing a dancing bird of paradise)
(And you can relax around me)
(He’s never gonna need another, never need another)

[Verse 1]
My cheeks were reflecting the longest wavelength
My fan was folded up and grazing my forehead
And I kept touching my neck to guide your eye to where
I wanted you to kiss me when we find some time alone

[Verse 2]
My scars were reflecting the mist in your headlights
I look like a neon zebra shaking rain off her stripes
And the rivulets had you riveted to the places that
I wanted you to kiss me when we find some time alone

[Chorus]
And then we can do anything we want
And then we can do anything we want
And then we can do anything we want

[Bridge]
Started out sippin' the water
And now we try to swallow the wave
And we try not to let those bastards get us down
We don't worry anymore
'Cause we know when the guff comes we get brave
After all, look around, it's happening, it's happening, it's happening now

[Verse 3]
Let's pretend we're eight years old playin' hooky
I draw on the wall and you can play UFC rookie
Then we'll grow up, take our clothes off and you remind me that
I wanted you to kiss me when we find some time alone

[Chorus]
And then we can do anything we want
And then we can do anything we want
And then we can do anything we want
And then we can do anything we want

[Verse 1]
I never take a day off
Work around the clock, my engineer gettin' paid off
Rock like Aesop, light the weed and take off
So high I cannot see, Adolf
Now I got these rappers all breakin' up a sweat
'Cause every time I get up on the mic, it come correct
And I learned it from the best, always dressed in somethin' fresh
Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest
Yes, they heard I used to rock Guess
But now I'm rockin' clothes that ain't in the stores yet
Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex
Tryna make it work out, think I need more reps
Used to take a bus, now the boy board jets
'Cause K.I.D.S. got me buzzin' like a fuckin' hornet
They say I got next, tell them that I got now
It's all Disney, boy, my family Proud
Make 'em say, "Ow," make 'em say, "Oh"
The hoes that tell me "Yes," the same ones that tell ya "No"
Whoa, I ain't just an Average Joe, way above the average flow
Boy, my life is Most Dope, uh

[Chorus]
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughin' like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek, ayy, ayy
And I ain't gonna wait for nothin'
'Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This gon' be the best day ever

[Verse 2]
If it ain't about a dream, then it ain't about me
Go a couple full weeks without a good night's sleep
Imagination, makin', musical creation
The journey that I'm facin' plus the paper that I'm chasin'
Got me crazy, half-insane, and with the lames I see you hatin'
But there's nothin' that you changin', thumbs up, I'm maintainin'
No complainin' when it's rainin', I'll be in another zone
Move out my mother's home to a world I call my own
I ain't gonna play around no more
Find a difference from the ground and the floor
If we got a fight, I'll be down for the war
Thumbs up, homie, I'll be sure

[Chorus]
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughin' like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek, ayy, ayy
And I ain't gonna wait for nothin'
'Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This gon' be the best day ever

Look at earth from outer space

Give me time, give us a kiss
Tell me your own politik

[Chorus]
Open up your eyes

Tell me your own politik

[Chorus]
And open up your eyes

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Trying hard to speak
And fighting with my weak hand
Driven to distraction
It's all part of the plan
When something is broken
And you try to fix it
Trying to repair it
Anyway you can

[Verse 2]
I dive in at the deep end
You become my best friend
I wanna love you
But I don't know if I can
I know something is broken
And I'm trying to fix it
Trying to repair it
Anyway I can

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Chorus]
You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space
And singing

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Chorus]
You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space
You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space
And singing

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 1]
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

[Chorus]
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start

[Verse 2]
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

[Chorus]
Nobody said it was easy
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

[Outro]
Oh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah
And I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
For it

[Verse 2]
I was scared, I was scared
Tired and underprepared
But I wait for it
And if you go, if you go
And leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Oh, for it

[Bridge]
Sing it please, please, please
Come back, come sing to me, to me, me
Come on and sing it out, now, now
Come on and sing it out to me, me
Come back and sing

[Outro]
In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Honey, you are a rock
Upon which I stand
And I come here to talk
I hope you understand

[Pre-Chorus]
The green eyes
Yeah, the spotlight shines upon you
And how could anybody deny you

[Chorus]
I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter
Now I met you
And, honey, you should know
That I could never go on without you
Green eyes

[Verse 2]
Honey, you are the sea
Upon which I float
And I came here to talk
I think you should know

[Pre-Chorus]
That green eyes
You're the one that I wanted to find
And anyone who tried to deny you
Must be out of their mind

[Chorus]
Because I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter since I met you
And, honey, you should know
That I could never go on without you

[Post-Chorus]
Green eyes
Green eyes

[Outro]
Honey, you are a rock
Upon which I stand

[Verse 1]
To my surprise, and my delight
I saw sunrise, I saw sunlight
I am nothing in the dark
And the clouds burst to show daylight

[Chorus]
Ooh, and the sun shine
Yeah, on this heart of mine
Oooh, and I realise
Who couldn't live without
Ooh, come apart without it

[Verse 2]
On a hilltop, on a sky-rise
Like a firstborn child
And at full tilt
And in full flight
Defeat darkness, breaking daylight

[Chorus]
Ooh, and the sun shine
Yeah, on this heart of mine
Oooh, and I realise
Who couldn't live without
Ooh, come apart without
Daylight

[Outro]
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight
Slowly breaking through a daylight

[Verse 1]
A warning sign
I missed the good part, then I realised
I started looking and the bubble burst
I started looking for excuses
Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

[Chorus]
When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah, the truth is
That I miss you so

[Verse 2]
A warning sign
You came back to haunt me and I realised
That you were an island and I passed you by
When you were an island to discover
Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started looking for a warning sign

[Chorus]
When the truth is
I miss you
Yeah, the truth is
That I miss you so

[Post-Chorus]
And I'm tired
I should not have let you go

[Outro]
So I crawl back into your open arms
Yes, I crawl back into your open arms
And I crawl back into your open arms
Yes, I crawl back into your open arms

[Chorus]
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
A whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

[Verse]
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Remember your face, who remembers you when you are gone?
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me when I am lost

[Chorus]
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

[Bridge]
Night turns to day
And I still have these questions
Bridges will break
Should I go forwards or backwards?
Night turns to day
And I still get no answers

[Chorus]
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

[Verse]
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Remember your face, who remembers you when you are gone?
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks
Come back and look for me, look for me when I am lost

[Chorus]
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper
Just a whisper, a whisper, a whisper, a whisper

[Outro]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 1]
He said, "I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down
I'm gonna put it six feet underground"
He said, "I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall
Stand here beside me, baby, in the crumbling walls
Oh, I'm gonna buy this place and start a fire
Stand here until I fill all your heart's desires
Because I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn
And do back the things it did to you in return"
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Said, "I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
Oh, and I'm gonna buy this place, is what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head"

[Chorus]
Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They say start as you mean to go on
Start as you mean to go on

[Verse 3]
He said, "I'm gonna buy this place and see it go
Stand here beside me, baby, watch the orange glow
Some will laugh and some just sit and cry
But you just sit down there and you wonder why
So I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war
If you can tell me something worth fighting for
And I'm gonna buy this place, is what I said
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head"
Oh, to the head, oh

[Chorus]
Honey, all the movements you're starting to make
See me crumble and fall on my face
And I know the mistakes that I made
See it all disappear without a trace
And they call as they beckon you on
They say start as you mean to go on
As you mean to go on
As you mean to go on

[Outro]
So meet me by the bridge
Oh, meet me by the lane
When am I going to see
That pretty face again?
Meet me on the road
Meet me where I said
Blame it all upon
A rush of blood to the head

[Verse 1]
Come on, oh, my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
If I, if I'd only waited
I'd not be stuck here in this hole

[Verse 2]
Come here, oh, my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
And I swear I waited and waited
I've got to get out of this hole

[Chorus]
But time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
It's no cause for concern

[Verse 3]
Come on, oh, my star is fading
And I see no chance of release
And I know I'm dead on the surface
But I am screaming underneath

[Chorus]
And time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
It's no cause for concern

[Outro]
Stuck on the end of this ball and chain
And I'm on my way back down again
Stood on a bridge, tied to a noose
Sick to the stomach
You can say what you mean
But it won't change a thing
I'm sick of the secrets
Stood on the edge
Tied to a noose
And you came along and you cut me loose
You came along and you cut me loose
You came along and you cut me loose

[Verse 1]
Where do we go? Nobody knows
I've got to say I'm on my way down
God give me style and give me grace
God put a smile upon my face

[Verse 2]
Where do we go to draw the line?
I've got to say I wasted all your time, oh, honey, honey
Where do I go to fall from grace
God put a smile upon your face, yeah

[Chorus]
And ah, when you work it out, I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out, I wanted to
And ah, when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

[Verse 3]
Where do we go? Nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way down when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face, oh yeah

[Chorus]
And ah, when you work it out, I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out, I wanted to
And ah, when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

[Bridge]
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
Na, na-na, na-na, num-ma-na, na-na
As good as mine
As good as mine (As good as mine)
As good as mine (As good as mine)
As good as mine (As good as mine)

[Outro]
Where do we go? Nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way down when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face

[Intro]
Steady are you ready?

[Bridge]
Back 2 life, back 2 reality
Back 2 life, back 2 reality

[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
Goin' through a dark place dark time, and I couldn't even see the light
Had my back up against the wall, I was feeling like do or die
But what don't kill me make me stronger, I know it's gonna be alright
So we celebrating here tonight, yeah, we celebrating life tonight

[Pre-Hook: Sean Kingston]
The time is now, gotta make it count
So before we die, let's go all out

[Hook: Sean Kingston]
We gotta live up, up, up, up, up
Champagne in my cup, cup, cup, cup, cup

Yea, we gotta live it up, up, up, up, up
You know we don't give a what what what what what

[Bridge]

[Verse 2: Sean Kingston]
All the tears and all of the prayers, every single one of y'all showed me
So the love I'm givin' back to y'all is bigger than the whole country
From England to Japan to Jamaica to right down the M-I-A
We don't stop, we go hard, let's get it in, call it young and free

[Pre-Hook, Hook, Bridge]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Okay, them suckas tried to bury me, Jesus had to carry me
Middle finger to the reaper, nigga ain't no scarin' me
Apparently, you dont understand who I am
It's trouble man hundred grand in my pan
Whippin' dropheads, hardtops, fit to sell Maybachs
Maseratis, Ferrari's those money I dont play by
Presidents stop me, imagine if I stay down
Still shining on to make them haters pull they shades out
When tragedy strikes, I struck back
Looking for me to roll over and die, who does that?
Left a nigga for dead, came back to life
I guess this is me ballin' in the afterlife
Let's hit it

[Bridge, Hook]

[Verse 1]
When I jumped off the porch I was forced into last resorts of a temper gone short
And, of course, when that took it's course, hoarse when yelling out
Demons that fought inside of me taught society how to rejoice
Killers on side of me, privacy obviously was lost
For a piracy of the streets and my Odyssey
Caught a bullet that probably destroyed...
A good kid in a mad city, slightly annoyed
I walk down the street with no heat and run into beef when I’m just a vegan
Reeking the scent of a saint, sinners smell it then start squeezing
Pellets tumbling straight at my melon, apparent reason...
Because my cousin's cuzzin a Blood
That was Blooding in public and Kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin
But you ain't no kin to me, probably Kendrick I'm Kennedy
Assassinate my character, shoot as your remedy
Fair enough I got enemies but I don’t bang
But that's the repercussion like when your cousin’s cuzzin a blood
And you’re by yourself at the Compton parade
Good Kid
M.A.A.D City
Life or death
Is you with me?
Wassup

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Baby, I'm here, I'm here to stay, I ain't going nowhere
I know you're scared 'cause you've been hurt, baby, it's alright
Lost in your eyes every time that you look in mine
Promise to be all that you need,  I won't leave you, baby

[Verse 2: Drake]
Say you'll be mine, say we'll be fine, say we'll be together
Selfish of me to ask, since I be the reason we don't last forever
Wished that you knew all that I do to make this thing go right
Promise to be all that you need, I won't leave you, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
No, 'cause I just wanna love you
I will never ever put nobody else up above you
I just wanna kiss you, baby
I just wanna hug you 'til the end, baby, 'til the end

[Bridge: Drake & Justin Bieber]
And I say, good girl's got her mind right
She been raised right, being patient I know you waiting
Waiting on the good things when the time's right
You should let me get to know you, baby
But I just wanna put it on you, if you want to
Baby, tell me what you gon' do, girl
I can make you feel perfect, girl, you're worth it
I just need to see you work it, girl

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
'Cause I'm right here, ain't nobody gotta hold ya
'Cause I'm right here, ain't nobody gon' control ya
'Cause I'm right right here, yeah yeah
I'm right here, I'm right here, I'm right here, I'm right here, yeah

Make the bed go, "Ee-rr" ("Ee-rr"), up and down like a seesaw (True)

Big dog, who don't? I do the shit that you don't
Livin' life in the fast lane so I bought me a two-door

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Your friends (Your friends) can't tell me nothing (They can't tell)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]

Champagne campaign, oh man, turn up the flame
Burn up the frame, hop in my game, what's my name? What's my name?
Ooh-ee, Snoopy, give it to ya like, "C'est la vie"
Life of the party, rockin' your body, blowin' big, bag it up, Bob Marley
Ladies and gents, players and pimps, this is the shit, 100 percent
So you can just shake it and make it and dip it and wop it and pop it and drop it and bend
I left the scene crispy clean, CBDBGZ, she see, we see, she see
RiRi, Kiki, Mimi, Bebe, all of 'em love me
Wasn't my fault, left your girl with seasonin' salt
D-O-double G, he's the boss, easin' 'em off, nice and soft, aw

[Bridge: Chris Brown, Snoop Dogg & Both]
Just go 'head and do the right thing, do the right thing

[Intro: Trey Songz & T.I.]
Tell the DJ turn it up
Bet the DJ bring it back
Tell him play that shit again
Tell him that you like that, like that, oh
Trey, I ain't got but two reasons to be here man
All the ballers poppin' bottles

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
I know it's somebody birthday
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
Yeah and somebody gettin' drunk too
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
Catch me in the club like I own that bitch
Shawty dancin' like she on that dick
Bad bitches never hold back
Send me a picture, where your phone at?

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I only came here for two reasons
I came for (Whatchu came for?)
I only came for the bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks
For the bitch, ca-came for the bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks, whatchu came for?
Baby, get your glass up, only came for bitches and the drinks
Baby, get your ass up, that's what I came for

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
I see you tryin' to handcuff her on the street
Stop trippin', you can't control that freak
Ain't nobody got a body like hers
Ghetto booty, but she came from the 'burbs
Got a dark skinned girl dancin' on me
Two white girls dancin' on me
Bad yellow bone, yeah I'm in my zone
Waitress keep comin' back, so you know we hella gone

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I only came here for two reasons
I came for (Whatchu came for?)
I only came for the bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks
For the bitch, ca-came for the bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks, whatchu came for?
Baby, get your glass up, only came for bitches and the drinks
Baby, get your ass up, that's what I came for

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I hit the club and buy the bar
In VIP, just see my partners and a lot of broads
And such a G' I be, just pop them bottles, party hard
I'm done with today, I'm lookin' for tomorrow
All I do is turn up, ain’t no dough it don’t concern us
All this bubba kush I burn up, smell some regular, it ruined us
Turning corners, fishtailin' out the parking lot yellin'
Bankhead, west side, eight or nine chicks trailin'
Right behind us, been this way since we were minors
If it wasn't for the chicks up in this bitch, you wouldn't find us
Even way out in China, same thing when I came through the door
Like, here you go again, where the bitches and the drink, yo

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I only came for the bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks
You need to know what I came for
Bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks
I know you know what I came for
Baby, get your glass up, only came for bitches and the drinks
Baby, get your ass up, that's what I came for

[Verse 4: Trey Songz]
Hey girl, you heard what I said, get your ass up
If you hot, you cold, you Florida, Alaska
Chicago, Virginia, New York City
Houston where the girls all thick
LA, the Bay, tell your girl 'bout this
Matter fact tell the whole GA
Ooh, you know they fine up and down the Carolinas
Shout to every ten I see when I'm down in Tennessee

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I only came here for two reasons
I came for (No)
I only came for the bitches and the drinks
I bust gat heat, right here at Fat Beatz
My man Ice-T, that is that heat
We here in LA chillin', KRS always willin', rhymes keep spillin'
I'm off the top, like what, the sun
My name is KRS-One, these stars, you don't see none
When I come out, you see all the day
These other whack rappers, we blow 'em away
Why? 'Cause they don't understand my cycle
I go from tape, CD, back to vinyl
Shh, you cats ain't ready
I take it back to RockSteady and give you a classic medley
Me? I'm not B-E-T or M-T-V, I'm H-I-P H-O-P

[Verse 1]
Well, the mourning was complete
When there was tears on the steering wheel dripping on the seat
Several hours or several weeks
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak

[Verse 2]
It's the beginning of the end
The car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
Ask anyone, they'll tell you that it's these times that it tends
To start to break in half, to start to fall apart, hold on to your heart

[Chorus]
And do me a favour and break my nose
Or do me a favour and tell me to go away
Or do me a favour and stop asking questions

[Verse 3]
As she walked away, well, her shoes were untied
And the eyes were all red, you could see that we'd cried
And I watched and I waited till she was inside
Forcing a smile and waving goodbye
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

[Chorus]
Do me a favour and ask if you need some help
She said, "Do me a favour and stop flattering yourself"
And to tear apart the ties that bind
Perhaps "fuck off" might be too kind
Perhaps "fuck off" might be too kind

[Verse 1]
We all want someone to shout for
Yeah, everyone wants somebody to adore
But your heroes aren't what they seem
When you've been where we've been
Have I done something to trigger
The funny looks and the sniggers?
Are they there at all
Or is it just paranoia?

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody's got their box
Doing what they're told
You push my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns
Don't care if it's marketing suicide
We won't crack or compromise
Your derisory divides
Will never unhinge us

[Verse 2]
And there's a couple of hundred
Think they're Christopher Columbus
But the settlers had already settled
Here long before you
Just 'cause we're having a say-so
Not lining up to be Play-Doh
Oh, in five years' time will it be
"Who the fuck's Arctic Monkeys?"

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody's got their box
Doing what they're told
You push my faith near being lost
But we'll stick to the guns
Don't care if it's marketing suicide
We won't crack or compromise
Your derisory divides
Will never unhinge us

[Verse 3]
All the thoughts that I just said
Linger 'round and multiply in the head
Not that bad to start with
I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed

[Verse 4]
It's not you, it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
It's not you, it's them that are wrong
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
Tell 'em to take out their tongues
And bring on the backlash

[Verse 5]
It's not you, it's them that are wrong
Tell him to take out his tongue
Tell him to take out his tongue
It's not you, it's them that's the fake
I won't mess with your escape
Is this really your escape? Yeah

[Intro: Pitbull]
Drop
They thought it was done dawg
But he's back bigger, better, stronger, and free
Like I ain't fought my way off these motherfucking situations
Trust this

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm here to remind you, just in case you forgot
Mr. 305, no label stay hot
38 choppers, but please, no Glock
Used to move work, but had no trap, no block, no spot
Ma was cool with the work, but no rocks
Until she found my first nickel ruff bag
Said, "I had enough of this shit with your dad"
So she told me to get the fuck out the pad
I was out to my first baby mama's crib
Caught her fuckin' round, off to abuela's crib
Thank God for music my savior
That's what helped me fight Xavier
Don't believe these rappers and what they play ya
I wanna be owner, fuck a playa
Shit, better say it
I am an owner, bitch

[Bridge: Avery Storm & (Pitbull)]
I got the city on my back and I won't surrender
Let 'em know now that they gon' remember
City on my back and I won't surrender
Let 'em know now that they gon' remember
They don't know (What I got into)
They don't know (Everything I been through)
They don't know (What it takes to get through)
They don't know, they don't know

[Chorus: Pitbull]
My life, pain
Struggle, hustle, grind
Them boys knock me down
You must be out yo fuckin' mind
My mom taught me to fight
Dade County raised me right
And we gon' take over this thing
Put down my fuckin' life

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Don't call it a come back, I've been here for years
Grindin' blood, sweat & tears
I done gave the game my life
I've turned the streets from my bitch to my wife
Every mornin' I woke up to the same shit
Everybody sayin' that I ain't shit
Them boys in the streets on that hate shit
Them boys on the same street, same block doin' that same shit
Planned to move bricks, but it's eight balls
Y'all want me, I hate y'all, but I ate y'all
Y'all can stay gorillas & apes
I'm on my way to the show, gettin' paid, marvelous rates
You the ace I'm the spade
Cut cut Dade, where they buck buck spray
This ain't a duck duck goose
This duck duck hey, press luck, get duct taped ASAP, okay

[Bridge: Avery Storm & (Pitbull)]
I got the city on my back and I won't surrender
Let 'em know now that they gon' remember
City on my back and I won't surrender
Let 'em know now that they gon' remember
They don't know (What I got into)
They don't know (Everything I been through)
They don't know (What it takes to get through)
They don't know, they don't know

[Chorus: Pitbull]
My life, pain
Struggle, hustle, grind
Them boys knock me down
You must be out yo fuckin' mind
My mom taught me to fight
Dade County raised me right
And we gon' take over this thing
Put down my fuckin' life

[Outro: Avery Storm]
Now you can stack the world against me
Close the doors, I can't come in
You could bet your life against me
Bet your ass I'm gonna win
You take that chance, you roll them dice
I prove you wrong, you prove me right
So damn what they say anyway

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Bones, sinking like stones
All that we fought for
Homes, places we’ve grown
All of us are done for

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
We live in a beautiful world
Yeah, we do, yeah, we do
We live in a beautiful world

[Verse 2: Chris Martin & Jonny Buckland]
Bones, sinking like stones
All that we fought for
Homes, places we’ve grown
All of us are done for

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
And we live in a beautiful world
Yeah, we do, yeah, we do
We live in a beautiful world

[Piano Solo]

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
And we live in a beautiful world
Yeah, we do, yeah, we do
We live in a beautiful world

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro: Chris Martin]
Oh, all that I know
There's nothing here to run from
'Cause yeah, everybody here's
Got somebody to lean on

[Verse 1]
So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention, do you?
I know you don't listen to me
'Cause you say you see straight through me, don't you?

[Refrain]
But on and on
From the moment I wake, 'til the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side, just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line, just to see if you care

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, did you want me to change?
Well, I changed for good
And I want you to know
That you'll always get your way
I wanted to say

[Chorus]
Don't you shiver
Shiver
Sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waiting for you

[Verse 2]
So you know how much I need you
But you never even see me, do you?
And is this my final chance of getting you?

[Refrain]
But on and on
From the moment I wake, 'til the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side, just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line
Just to see if you care, if you care

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, did you want me to change?
Well, I changed for good
And I want you to know
That you'll always get your way
I wanted to say

[Chorus]
Don't you shiver
Don't you shiver
Sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waiting for you

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
For you I will always be waiting

[Refrain]
And it's you I see, but you don't see me
And it's you I hear so loud and so clear
I sing it loud and clear
And I'll always be waiting for you

[Outro]
So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention
And you know how much I need ya
But you never even see me

[Verse 1: Tyga]
I am living the game, hitting the fades, quick cash
Blink too fast you'll be gone, no quicksand
This man ain't givin a fuck for no middle man, middle class
Skipped class only class I knew, was S-Benz
Now pretend you never heard of me from a can of candy yams
And I was just a boy like killer cam
But now my print over yo bitch, T-shirt
Glass skirt, research his work, iPhone Blackberry chirp
But it gets worse, how would you feel
Fresh of work, seeing this light-skinned jerk
After I'm all working your girlfriend purse
Damn ma, didn't he fuck friend ha?
Yea why? I thought that goofy bitch was lying
Guess not, bet not they won't near us
Fear us, Y.M squadron
Young bloods
Nothing above eyebrows, G.E.D forever above
Studio, many yums, I ain't fucking with the club
While you getting bub, I'm getting pub
These songs I mean, these songs be mean
Got your label warring, Cause I'm making quality quantities
I got the holy spirit, but no father son

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
Now everybody know I'm shining in the coupe
No roof while I'm shitting on em
Rolling through the eastside, Hollandwood is hitting for
I'm all about my hustle, need my chips so I could stack it up
Gone on the pill got me rolling like a acura
Young money nigga, Yea I'm back like I left something
You niggas is jaw jacking, watch me sidestep son
Young nigga, got my money running like Barry
Bitches want my baby cause they heard about my salary
Make them dog hoes lay it down like balling g
Knock them bitches socks loose, pass em off to Mallie G
All brown maybach, you could say I'm yoohoo'n
All my niggas red flagging you could see we soo woo'n

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Dedication 3

Looks so deceiving, you convinced me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
So clear to me now
Can't explain what you're doing to me, yeah, aye

[Chorus]
Cause I'm in love with the thought of you
With the thought of you, with the thought of you

[Verse 1]
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

[Chorus]
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you've made of me
I found the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

[Verse 2]
You should have listened
There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm screamin' out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside on words
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

[Chorus]
Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

[Bridge]
I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't

[Chorus]
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but I will complete
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own, my own
Chorus 1
Go straight to the dance floor
Go straight to the dance floor
When you hear this sound
When you hear this sound
Straight to the dance floor
Go straight to the dance floor
When you hear this sound
When you hear this sound

Verse
(Jamie Foxx)
I don't play a little park
I'm a backseat driver
Ocean in my backyard
Deep sea diver
Turn tricks on the bitch
You can call me McGuyver
Let them spit
Make them hit the saliva
I don't play around about my dough
So mean with green
Whatever I say goes
That's why your girlfriend chose
Chorus 2
I got my hands on my nutz
And a bottle up in the air
I'm with a hundred black suits
So dem hoes can't help but stare
You see my face on the billboard
That's me right there
And I ain't never in my life
Seen a nigga this fly I swear

CHORUS 1
Order me a few more rounds
Cause it's about to go down
CHORUS 1

(Jamie Foxx)
Timmed up chi-town on the haters
California love put shot at the Lakers
Game, I ain't never been a lame or a hater
Matter fact I'm on Larry King later
Gotta whole lotta change I can blow

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I love everything about you, you're imperfectly perfect
Everyone's itchin' for beauty, but just scratching the surface
Lost time is never found, can the DJ please reverse it?
In life we pay for change, let's make every second worth it
Anything can work if you work it
When people say you don't deserve it, then don't give in
'Cause hate may win some battles, but love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you, it's only right that

[Verse 1]
Sun comes up on another morning
My mind never wakes up without you on it
And it's crazy to me
I even see you in my dreams
Is this meant to be?
Could this be happening to me, yeah?
We were best of friends since we were this high
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by?
We would be on the phone all day
Now I can't find the words to say to you
Now what am I supposed to do?

[Chorus]
Could it be a possibility?
I'm tryna see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me
Maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough
They say we're too young for love, but I'm catching feelings
Catching feelings, girl

[Verse 2]
In my head, we're already together
I'm good alone, but with you I'm better
I just want to see you smile
Just say the word and I'll be right there
I ain't never going nowhere
I'm just tryna see where this can take us
Cause everything about you, girl, is so contagious
I think I finally got it down
And all that's left to do now is get out the mirror
And say it to her, yeah

[Chorus]
Could it be a possibility?
I'm tryna see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me
Maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough
They say we're too young for love, but I'm catching feelings
Catching feelings, girl

[Bridge]
Should I tell her how I really feel?
Should I move in close or just be still?
How will I know?
Cause if I take a chance and I touch her hand, will everything change?
How do I know, if she feels the same, oh?

[Chorus]
Could it be a possibility?
I'm tryna see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me
Maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough
They say we're too young for love, but I'm catching feelings
Catching feelings, girl

[Outro]
Catching feelings, catching feelings

[Verse 1]
Well let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But did you know that I loved you?
Or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face, and I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

[Chorus]
What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

[Verse 2]
Well, I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
And I don't think I can stand sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well, did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry?
Cause I know that a piece of you’s gone, every time you done wrong, I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song I'll have figured out

[Chorus]
What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love (my love)
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

[Bridge]
I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can’t fly unless you let yourself fall

[Chorus]
What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love (my love)
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall
What's gonna make you fall in love? (in love)
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all (don't have to be scared, don't have to be scared)
Oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you listen,  let yourself fall

Would you lie to me, baby?
Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy?

Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you

[Verse 1]
Across the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps in the road, and upside down now
I know it's hard to be asleep at night

[Chorus 1]
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

All alone in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
For you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms holding my heart
Oh I, oh I, I love you

And everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the long nights and the bright lights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she's not my girl

[Verse 1]
Can anybody fly this thing?
Before my head explodes
Or my head starts to ring?

[Pre-Chorus]
We've been living life inside a bubble
We've been living life inside a bubble

[Chorus]
Confidence in you
Is confidence in me
Is confidence in high speed

[Verse 2]
Can anybody stop this thing?
Before my head explodes
Or my head starts to ring?

[Pre-Chorus]
We've been living life inside a bubble
We've been living life inside a bubble

[Chorus]
Confidence in you
Is confidence in me
Is confidence in high speed

[Bridge]
In high speed
High speed

[Outro]
High speed you on
High speed you on
High speed you on
High speed you on

[Verse 1]
I awake to find no peace of mind
I said, "How do you live as a fugitive
Down here, where I cannot see so clear?"
I said, "What do I know?
Show me the right way to go"

[Chorus]
And the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
That the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them, no
'Cause they're all spies
They're all spies

[Verse 2]
I awake to see that no one is free
We're all fugitives, look at the way we live
Down here, I cannot sleep from fear, no
I said, "Which way do I turn?"
Oh, I forget everything I learn

[Chorus]
And the spies came out of the water
And you're feeling so bad 'cause you know
That the spies hide out in every corner
But you can't touch them, no
'Cause they're all spies
They're all spies

[Bridge]
And if we don't hide here
They're gonna find us
And if we don't hide now
They're gonna catch us where we sleep
Ah, and if we don't hide here
They're gonna find us

[Chorus]
And the spies came out of the water
But you're feeling so good 'cause you know
That those spies hide out in every corner
They can’t touch you, no
'Cause they're just spies

[Outro]
They're just spies
They're just spies
They're just spies
They're just spies

[Verse 1]
Did I drive you away?
I know what you'll say
You say, "Oh, sing one you know"
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
Yeah, that's what I'll do

[Chorus]
I say, oh
I say, oh

[Verse 2]
My heart is yours
It's you that I hold on to
Yeah, that's what I do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
Oh yeah I will, yeah I will, yes I will

[Chorus]
I said, oh
I cry, oh

[Bridge]
Yeah, I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
Sing it out

[Outro]
La-la-la-la, oh
La-la-la-la, oh
La-la-la-la, oh
La-la-la-la, oh

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Look at the stars, look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along, I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow"
So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

[Chorus 1: Chris, Jonny & Will]
(Aah) Your skin, oh, yeah, your skin and bones
(Ooh) Turn into something beautiful
(Aah) You know, you know I love you so
You know I love you so

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I swam across, I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line, I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

[Chorus 2: Chris, Jonny & Will]
(Aah) Your skin, oh, yeah, your skin and bones
(Ooh) Turn into something beautiful
(Aah) And you know, for you, I'd bleed myself dry
For you, I'd bleed myself dry

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
It's true, look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

[Outro: Chris Martin]
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do

[Verse 1]
Oh no, I see
A spider web is tangled up with me
And I lost my head
And thought of all the stupid things I'd said

[Verse 2]
Oh no, what's this?
A spider web, and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
And thought of all the stupid things I'd done

[Chorus]
And I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm

[Verse 3]
Oh no, I see
A spider web, and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
But here am I in my little bubble

[Chorus]
Singing that I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no, I never meant to do you harm

[Outro]
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me

[Verse 1]
I wanna live life and never be cruel
I wanna live life and be good to you
And I wanna fly and never come down
And live my life and have friends around

[Chorus]
We never change, do we? No, no
We never learn, do we?

[Verse 2]
So I wanna live in a wooden house
I wanna live life and always be true
I wanna live life and be good to you
And I wanna fly and never come down
And live my life and have friends around

[Chorus]
We never change, do we? No, no
We never learn, do we?

[Verse 3]
So I wanna live in a wooden house
Where making more friends would be easy
Oh, and I don't have a soul to save
Yes, and I sin every single day

[Chorus]
We never change, do we?
We never learn, do we?

[Outro]
So I wanna live in a wooden house
Where making more friends would be easy
I wanna live where the sun comes out

[Verse 1]
When I counted up my demons
Saw there was one for every day
With the good ones on my shoulders
I drove the other ones away

[Chorus]
So if you ever feel neglected
And if you think that all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

[Verse 2]
When you thought that it was over
You could feel it all around
And everybody's out to get you
Don't you let it drag you down

[Chorus]
'Cause if you ever feel neglected
And if you think that all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

[Chorus]
If you ever feel neglected
If you think that all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

[Bridge]
Singin' out, oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Everything's not lost
So come on, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Come on, yeah
And everything's not lost
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
And everything's not lost
Come on, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Come on, yeah
Come on, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Come on, yeah
And everything's not lost
Sing out, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Come on, yeah
And everything's not lost
Come on, yeah
Oh, oh yeah
Sing out, yeah
And everything's not lost

[Verse 1]
I let the beast in too soon
I don't know how to live without my hand on his throat
I fight him always and still
Oh darling, it's so sweet
You think you know how crazy
How crazy I am
You say you don't spook easy
You won't go
But I know
And I pray that you will

[Chorus]
Fast as you can, baby
Run, free yourself of me
Fast as you can

[Verse 2]
I may be soft in your palm
But I'll soon grow hungry for a fight
And I will not let you win
My pretty mouth will frame the phrases
That will disprove your faith in man
So if you catch me trying to find my way into your heart
From under your skin

[Chorus]
Fast as you can, baby
Scratch me out, free yourself
Fast as you can
Fast as you can, baby
Scratch me out, free yourself
Fast as you can

[Bridge]
Sometimes my mind don't shake and shift
But most of the time, it does
And I get to the place where I'm begging for a lift
Or I'll drown in the wonders and the was
And I'll be your girl, if you say it's a gift
And you give me some more of your drugs
Yeah, I'll be your pet, if you just tell me it's a gift
Cause I'm tired of whys, choking on whys
Just need a little because, because

[Verse 3]
I let the beast in and then
I even tried forgiving him, but it's too soon
So I'll fight again, again, again, again, again
And for a little while more
I'll soar the uneven wind, complain and blame the sterile land
But if you're getting any bright ideas, quiet dear
I'm blooming within

[Chorus]
Fast as you can, baby, wait, watch me; I'll be out
Fast as I can, maybe late but at least about
Fast as you can, leave me, let this thing run its route

[Outro]
Fast as you can
Fast as you can
Fast as you can
Fast as you can
When the pawn hits the conflicts he thinks like a king
What he knows throws the blows when he goes to the fight
And he'll win the whole thing 'fore he enters the ring
There's nobody to batter when your mind is your might
So when you go solo you hold your own hand
And remember that depth is the greatest of heights
And if you know where you stand then you know where to land
And if you fall it won't matter 'cause you'll know that you're right

[Verse 1]
007 and Brucey Wayne
Are shitting them sens because there's another name
Coming to claim what is his to claim
Ten percent faster with a sturdier frame
He's certainly come into his own
There's one on his arm in every land that he roams
And two consecutive nights alone
Are a thing of the past as he has recently shown

[Chorus]
They said he looks so handsome, stood not dancing
Drawing you in like it's boring to him
It's a war you can't win and the first and the last
Are two things you'll never be, my darling

[Verse 2]
Another roll around and another push and shove
Further away from the idea of love
And his conclusion, it must be good
Or when the penny has dropped with an incredible thud
Forgot to kick the tin
He knows where she's going, but don't know where she's been
And as opposed to the other thing
He'll worry about it when it's trouble he's in

[Chorus]
They said he looks so handsome, stood not dancing
Drawing you in like it's boring to him
It's a war you can't win and the first and the last
Are two things you'll never be, my darling
(Two things you'll never be, my darling)
Two things you will never be, my darling
(Two things you'll never be, my darling)

[Outro]
Well, he sneered and sniffed and spat at my chat up-lines
Not to feel like a twat at times, it's hard
But not for this kid, not when they come to you

[Verse 1]
Don't need your name, girl, don't need your number
This might seem strange but can't help but wonder
What it would be like, just to be with you
Don't need to move fast, just wanna think it through

[Pre-Chorus]
Like how you hold me
And what you told me
Girl, you don't even know me
Babe, what you tryna do?

[Chorus]
'Cause every time I'm looking in your eyes
Got me thinking 'bout you, wanna take you home
We need to be alone tonight
Tell me what you want, I wanna find out you what you like
You make me say, "Ooh"
Just wanna love you
Don't know what you do
Just looking at you
You make me say, "Ooh"
Just wanna love you
Don't know what you do
Just looking at you

[Verse 2]
I love the way you move, we're on the right track
Don't be a stranger, girl, bring that ass back
Know who you came with, and I ain't tryna take his place
But you thinking 'bout leaving with me, it's written on your face

[Pre-Chorus]
Like how you want me
How your body calls me
Girl, you don't even know me, yeah
Babe, what you tryna do?

[Chorus]
'Cause every time I'm looking in your eyes
Got me thinking 'bout you, wanna take you home (Ooh baby)
We need to be alone tonight
Tell me what you want, I wanna find out you what you like
You make me say, "Ooh"
Just wanna love you
Don't know what you do
Just looking at you, oh (Yeah, yeah)
You make me say, "Ooh" (Oh, oh, oh woah)
Just wanna love you (Oh, oh)
Don't know what you do (Baby, you're the greatest)
Just looking at you (No, I ain't playing)

[Bridge]
Oh, let me and you dance tonight
And ain't nobody else but me and you girl, girl
My heart's involved this time
Don't know what it is but you make me say

[Chorus]
You make me say
Oh girl, girl
Just wanna love
Just wanna love, wanna love, girl
Don't know what you do
Yeah
Just looking at you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh woah
You make me say
Yeah, yeah, oh woah
Just wanna love
Yeah
Don't know what to do
Yeah, yeah
Just looking at you
Yeah, yeah, to do yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, just wanna have you
Wanna have you
Just wanna have you
(You make me say)

[Verse 1]
Oh I was perfect for the circus
If she dared me I'd do it
Love makes you stupid
I gave it up
But I guess it was not enough
Cause she never seemed satisfied

[Chorus]
I know I'm not perfect
But at the end of the day who is?
She wanted someone that's perfect
OK, but can you tell me who Is?

Ooooh Oooh Ooh
Ooooh Oooh Ooh

[Verse 2]
She set the bar just above the stars
A rocket couldn't reach it but I still kept on reaching
She watched me try at least a thousand times
If she loved me she'd stopped me but no

[Chorus]
I know I'm not perfect
But at the end of the day who is?
She wanted someone that's perfect
OK, but can you tell me who Is?

[Verse 3]
I saw something worth my future
So right, so wrong
In my mind I was all it took, but I guess I wasn't wrong?

[Chorus]
I know I'm not perfect
But at the end of the day who is?
She wanted someone that's perfect
OK, but can you tell me who Is?

[Outro]
Ooooh Oooh Ooh
Ooooh Oooh Ooh

Apparently that's what'chu suppose to say to the producers

Aye

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Coming to the stage is a motherfucka cold as the South Pole
They say his mouth don't look right without gold
He make hits that'll knock a nigga out cold
Known as the sellout, rocking them sold out shows
Born rich in the brain
Only game you got left is to get to the fame, you getting me mayne?
He never stick to the same, ol' same ol'
Have a nigga leanin' and rockin' like he was Fabo (OH)
But now the case close
Ain't no one-hit wonder here, mu'fucker, the first 48 gone
I need a case load of paseo chips
Somebody pass me the queso dip
Or the keg goin' flip

[Hook: x4]
Buddy you're a boy make a big noise
Playing in the street gonna be a big man some day, you got

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
You know me, so you know that
If you listening to this, that mean you on crack
Head to the back, back of the whip
Chauffeur catch a contact officer stitch
Muthafucka it's the mista' 'have we kill em'
Put the Timber in the lake and make it cry me a river
Get-get-get paid, no pain, no-no gain
Know how to make the shit grow: Rogaine
Propane when I step in the mic booth
Crew clean like a white suit in a white coupe
When you look in the mirror, it don't like you
And Imma keep it on the low: 5'2"

[Hook x4]
Buddy you're a boy make a big noise
Playin' in the street gonna be a big man some day, you got

Redfoo
Mr. Worldwide, Vein, Rush

[Chorus: Vein]
You took my love, I thought I was the only one
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps tellin' me you're the one
You took my love, took my love
Da-da-da-da-di, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-di, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-di, da-da-da-da-di
Da-da-da-da-di, da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Loquita, I don't play, you know what time it is with me
You want my heart, you got to work
And show me that you'll ride or die for me
I can see right through your eyes
And I know what you're tryin' to do
You're tryin' to rob, steal, take my love; well, fuck you
Take my love? (Hahaha)
Not a woman on earth that can do that, say what?
I don't know where you're from or where you been at
I'm lettin' you know what's up
And if you don't play by the rules, baby, you get caught
I talked so much, she took my love, fuck

[Chorus: Vein]
You took my love, I thought I was the only one
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps tellin' me you're the one
You took my love, took my love
Da-da-da-da-di, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-di, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-di, da-da-da-da-di
Da-da-da-da-di, da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 2: Redfoo]
Yo, I'm in the club and the place is poppin'
Sip-sippin' bub' and the bass is knockin'
Times are great 'cause I'm with my crew
But my smile's fake 'cause I'm missin' you
Baby, you know that I done learned my lesson
Should've gave you more time, more love, and affection
And when I see you later with that other guy
Keep tellin' myself a player ain't supposed to cry

[Chorus: Vein]
You took my love, I thought I was the only one
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps tellin' me you're the one
You took my love, took my love
Da-da-da-da-di, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-di, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-di, da-da-da-da-di
Da-da-da-da-di, da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 3: David Rush]
(Rusher!)
She took my love and played for a sucker
But it don't even matter 'cause you know I still love her
She took my heart and threw it on the ground
But it don't even matter 'cause I still want her around
She's such a love taker, she's such a love taker
It's guaranteed that she's a professional heart-breaker
But a great love maker, all in the sheets
She made my heart skip a beat
But for now, she's as cold as they come
No match, no knife, and no gun: she took my love

[Chorus: Vein]
You took my love, I thought I was the only one
You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
You took my love, but my heart keeps tellin' me you're the one
You took my love, took my love
Da-da-da-da-di, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-di, da-da-da-da-da-da

Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Da-da-da-da-di, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-di, da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1]
I certainly haven't been shopping for any new shoes
And
I certainly haven't been spreading myself around
I still only travel by foot and by foot it's a slow climb
But I'm good at being uncomfortable so
I can't stop changing all the time

[Verse 2]
I noticed that my opponent is always on the go
And
Won't go slow, so 's not to focus, and I notice
He'll hitch a ride with any guide, as long as
They go fast from whence he came
But he's no good at being uncomfortable, so
He can't stop staying exactly the same

[Chorus]
If there was a better way to go then it would find me
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me
Be kind to me, or treat me mean
I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine

[Verse 3]
I seem to you to seek a new disaster every day
You deem me due to clean my view and be at peace and lay
I mean to prove I mean to move in my own way and say
I've been getting along for long before you came into the play

[Verse 4]
I am the baby of the family, it happens
So
Everybody cares and wears the sheeps' clothes
While they chaperone
Curious, you looking down your nose at me, while you appease
Courteous, to try and help
But let me set your mind at ease

[Chorus]
If there was a better way to go then it would find me
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me
Be kind to me, or treat me mean
I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine

[Bridge]
Do I so worry you, you need to hurry to my side?
It's very kind
But it's to no avail; and I don't want the bail
I promise you, everything will be just fine

[Chorus]
If there was a better way to go then it would find me
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me
Be kind to me, or treat me mean
I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine
If there was a better way to go then it would find me
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me
Be kind to me, or treat me mean
I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine

[Part I: Lovers In Japan]

[Verse 1]
Lovers keep on the road you're on
Runners until the race is run
Soldiers, you've got to soldier on
Sometimes even the right is wrong

[Chorus]
They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day we're gonna get out

[Verse 2]
Tonight maybe we're gonna run
Dreaming of the Osaka sun
Oh, Oh
Dreaming of when the morning comes

[Chorus]
They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day the sun will come out

[Part II: Reign of Love]

[Intro]

Reign of love

Lift me up
I'm just a prisoner in a reign of love

[Verse 2]
Locust wind
Here I stop
How I wish I'd spoken up
To a reign of love

[Verse 3]
Reign of love

Haters wanna body me cause I'm a hot commodity
Puffin on that hater ease the pain like a apology
Niggas they can spit but they'll never be as fly as me
Wrist lookin like the same arena where the Flyers be- ICEY
I know, I don't think they like me
Maybe cause I might be dickin down they wifey
Umm, It's easy to hate me it's harder to love me
You a hater

[Verse 2]
Before I met T.I.P. I was the king, Martin Luther
Diamonds in the bezzle lookin husky, Rasputia
Don't get it twisted I spit, but I'm a shooter
Glock 17 clip hangin longer then a ruler
Every time I see them hoes they be like
You the best like Drizzy, but I tell them I'm cooler
I ain't even hit, she gave me brain like a tutor
I kick that chick out early in the morning like a rooster
I'm a D.O.P.E.B.O.Y
Lookin like money everytime I flow by
Haters hatin on me
I don't know why
Cause I'm come from da bottom were da sun don't shine
Pops died young so I had to man up
Cases got caught so I had to stand up

She like to get frisky, every time she see me
And she can't pronounce her name 'cause her lips are shaking
I know what your girl like (Yeah), I know what your girl want (Yeah)

She's hands ups and down, can't get enough of it
And she can break it down every time we dancing

[Chorus]
One love
You can let it out
You can let it out
You can let it out, cause
I shoulda known, shoulda known
I shoulda known, shoulda known
One love
You can let it out
You can let it out
You can let it out, cause
I shoulda known, shoulda known
I shoulda known, shoulda known

[Verse 1]
Bino, I'm so for real-o, green like I'm Cee Lo
Hangin' out with Kilo... Kish, smokin' on that Keisha
I'ma need that visa
I'm working on everything that I'm touching man
I'm bussin' two white Russians drinking themselves
But it's still ain't nothing yo
It's East side if you can't tell, North Decatur and Glendale
So fuck y'all, all y'all, if y'all don't like me, good
Put that on my partner man, I wish a nigga would
I say we ain't playing man I hope that's understood
I'm in my zone though, fucking 'round with that 4-0
Eating my mamas salmon but skipping on the risotto
Girl said that she need the follow, tweet her and she'll do any
Man, I'm trying to stay off, readin' 'em makes me angry
On the back on the tour bus, recording the two of us
Stacks at the Apple store, man this ballin' is new to us
Trying to make amends, bailing on all my friends
Niggas went to the club, sent a beat to Gucci instead
Man I'm feelin' right, my nigga Fam yellin', "Don't stop"
And half my crew is always faded on some low top
Stopped drinking for the most part
My only vices all our pictures on my laptop
Screaming at me saying, "I ain't what you really want"
Christina's parents baby all I make is Milians
We got the shows, we got the paper, but I want respect
So tell them haters we ain't quitting yet
Let 'em know

[Chorus]
One love
You can let it out
You can let it out
You can let it out, cause
I shoulda known, shoulda known
I shoulda known, shoulda known
One love
You can let it out
You can let it out
You can let it out, cause
I shoulda known, shoulda known
I shoulda known, shoulda known
One love
You can let it out
You can let it out
You can let it out, cause
I shoulda known, shoulda known
I shoulda known, shoulda known
One love
You can let it out
You can let it out
You can let it out, cause
I shoulda known, shoulda known
I shoulda known, shoulda known

[Verse 2]
One love, the thing that hasn't changed
My parents lost their job, it's so cold in the A
Now that I'm one percent, I send most of it home
I want to stunt but she need to pay off her student loans
And everybody saying, "Get it while you hitting man
We want them harder beats, that 808 you slipping man"
Dude is so stupid popping anything they hand me
On that parking lot pimping and politicking in Miami
In that home of the D where they sell that cake batter
Heard a voice in the back, hate from all the fake rappers
That I shitted on, shitted on
Shitted on, shitted on
Rap your soul, dude, let the mic blaze
Show 'em A-Town, East Side, all day
I put it on, I put it on
I put it on, I put it on
Life is somethin' IMAX, film is at a climax
I ain't even started, was it stupid I departed?
Man, probably, but now we do the things we always wanted
I'm proud of me, cause I am undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with
Please somebody cum laude me
Graduated, anticipated the hatred and doubted me
Not a prodigy, just a hard worker from the Dean's List
But most these rappers doin' so-so like a seamstress
Jesus

[Chorus]
One love
You can let it out
You can let it out
You can let it out, cause
I shoulda known, shoulda known
I shoulda known, shoulda known
One love
You can let it out
You can let it out
You can let it out, cause
I shoulda known, shoulda known
I shoulda known, shoulda known
One love
You can let it out
You can let it out
You can let it out, cause
I shoulda known, shoulda known
I shoulda known, shoulda known
One love
You can let it out
You can let it out
You can let it out, cause
I shoulda known, shoulda known
I shoulda known, shoulda known

[Intro: Noreaga]
Yea, yea, we back again, we doin' our shit, yo
Word up, I wanna hear some fly shit
You know what I'm sayin', some get high shit
Word up, I wanna hear some white boy shit, man
Yo, I wanna hear some Eminem, man
Talkin' about all that shit he be doin'

[Hook: Slim Shady]
You ain't into fuckin' drugs, fuck you
You don't do ecstasy, fuck you
You don't pop mushrooms, fuck you
If you don't wanna tab of acid, fuck you

[Verse 1: Slim Shady]
I'm nauseous in this place, I need some office space
The boss is late, I wanna slap the mustache right off his face
I'm ready to go postal, I'm so close
I can almost feel his throat with no pulse when I choke him
In ten seconds I'mma turn into Hulk Hogan
With a cigarette in his mouth
He tells me there's no smokin'
I'm sick of this shit, it's ridiculous
All I picture is kickin' his ass
When he's taking his ashes and flickin' 'em
I'm sick of these stamps
I'm sick of lickin' 'em, sick of stickin' 'em
I'm sick of lookin' at 'em, I'm sick of 'em
"Alright, Mr. Mathers, pick 'em up!"
No you pick 'em up! Bitch, stick 'em up
Get against the wall, senior citizens and all
I can't take this shit no more, everybody hit the floor
Get the door, close it and lock it
Put your wallets back in your pocket, I don't want dollars
Ain't none of us walkin' out of this office

[Hook: Slim Shady]
Faggot, fuck you, work at the post office, fuck you
Talkin' shit to me, tellin' me to take out
The goddamn garbage, fuck you
If you're a fuckin' dick, fuck you
If you're a white rapper, fuck you
Talk shit about Stretch? You're cool
But if you don't talk shit about Stretch, fuck you
If you're a fuckin' punk, fuck you
Talk shit about me, fuck you
You wanna battle me, fuck you
I ain't got to say shit to you but fuck you
Yellow Lamborgini with the butter rims
True Religions sagging off my butter Timbs
These haters always acting like I owe 'em something
Like when they ass was down bad I never throwed 'em nothing
He say he ain't gon' fuck with me no more, OK
Tell the truth I never liked the lame, no way
Wishing back like why the hell they ever gave you money
Got bitches laughing at me, I ain't even said shit funny
Now ask yourself what really have you done for me
Cause I don't need noone to tote no guns for me
A hundred thousand dollar bribe I paid the bond for me
I copped a plea, ?, they said could set me free
(You have one minute remaining)
So if you lookin' for a flop, go and jump in the ocean
If I wasn't the boss I'd have to give myself a promotion
Tried to be the bigger man than ?
Don't make me have to send the goons to come back flashing wind
High definition paint job like a plasma ?
Got these bitches at the bus stop grabbing asthma pumps
Got a loyal chick, I always buy her Gucci pumps
Got a college girl, I keep her in the latest dunks
???
???? Robin jeans
Glock 45, I don't know what robbin' means
It's like you're talkin Japanese you're talkin' robbin' me
My girl she said it's over Gucci, I said OK
To tell the truth I never liked her ass, no way
??? baby your life's a crazy ?
I told you ??? look at all the ?? nigga

[Intro]
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
Here you go, trippin'
Everything is cool between us, Bey
I told you that
Out on the road wit' my people, just doin' what I gotta do
There’s nothin' goin' on that shouldn't be goin' on
You got to trust me, Ma

[Verse 1]
I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day havin' your kids
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong

[Verse 2]
I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me, you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I moved on
Because I realized I've got

[Chorus]
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gon' be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gon' be my own best friend

[Verse 3]
You're so controlling, you say that you love me but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong

[Verse 4]
Now that it's over, stop callin' me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me
All your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
Took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I've got

[Chorus]
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gon' be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gon' be my own best friend

[Post-Chorus]
(I've got me, myself, and I)
I know that I will never disappoint myself
(My eyes have cried a thousand times)
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(It's how I learned how to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again
(Now I've got me, myself, and I)
Hey, I know that I will never disappoint myself
(My eyes have cried a thousand times)
I've cried
All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
(I can't regret time spent with you)
Yeah-yeah, you hurt me, but I learned a lot along the way
(It's how I learned how to make it through)
After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again

[Break]
Yeah-eah, hee
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-ha
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
(I've got me, myself, and I)
Me, my
