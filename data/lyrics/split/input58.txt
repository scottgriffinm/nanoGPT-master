on is the Biebs"
Watch celebrities take selfies with celebrities
It feels so make-believe
They want the gossip, they want the drama
They want Britney Spears to make out with Madonna
They want Kanye to rant and to go on longer, cause that equates to more dollars
They want talking topics, they want trending topics
They want outfits to be outlandish, they want sideways glances
Beef and problems, they want nipple slips
Cause they live for clicks, this is economics
So we Botox our skin and we smile for the camera
Might as well get a new nose while we're at it
This is America, insecurity's our fabric
And we wear it and we renamed it fashion
I look to my right, there's a cameraman snapping
Picture after picture after sister after sister
Of the line of Kardashians, mind so distracted
Realized there's an ovation and everyone's clapping

[Hook: Mike Slap]
Last night the skies turned purple and
Past lives in light tunnels
Light tunnels
So that's who we are
Just like the stars
Shine your light on
Shine your light on

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
It's just weird when the camera's on you
Gotta remember to still clap if I lose
I see myself on the screen
Split into five different artists on TV
Just look normal, don't get turned into a meme
Relax, breathe
(And the award goes to Macklemore and Ryan Lewis)
Me
There's a stranger holding my award
I give her an awkward hug she says "It's yours"
Think I'm supposed to kiss her on the cheek
Man, I should have prepared an acceptance speech
Do I talk first? Is it Ryan? Is it me?
Fuck it, I'll take the lead, grab the mic, say my piece
Do I look at camera one? Do I look at camera three?
I promise, I'm honored, I'd like to thank God, my momma and father
I'd like to thank Tricia, the mother of my daughter
I couldn't have done it without you all in my corner
Especially the fans, been here since the beginning
Supported the music, allowed us to be independent
And I know, I shouldn't be long-winded
Wait, hold up, don't play the music, let me finish
This feels so narcissistic, dressed as a celebration to conceal it's a business
Me, me, me, my, my image, my, my songs, my self-interest
One big reality show that is scripted
And I can keep trying or get off the competition
I'd rather run out of my fifteen minutes
Than have life past me by and I forget to live it
But that doesn't mean retirement
But I don't like who I am in this environment
I forgot what this art's for
I didn't get through Freshman year to drop out as a Sophomore
Here I am in this arena, yeah, I'm scared
I got the people's attention, don't wanna lose it here
Thinking about my career, miserable here
But wanna make sure I'm invited next year
To the same damn party, celebrities and aisles
Same blank stares, same fake smiles
Same big-budget production
I know now who I am when the lights go out and it falls down
And the curtain closes, nobody notices
Wanted to throw up the Roc, wanted to be Hova
Wanted to be Wayne with the accent from the 'Nolia
Thought I'd feel better when the award show was over
But I guess I showed up late
Almost got cut off when they closed the gate
Just in time, what will I say?
Time to explain this unruly mess I've made
I guess I showed up late
Almost got cut off when they closed the gate
Just in time, what will I say?
Time to explain this unruly mess I've made

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I used to work at Subway
Seven bucks an hour wasn't much money
But I be rapping and kicking it on my lunch break
Like "I'ma make it out this motherfucker one day"
I was in the back, back seat of the bus before a bluetooth
Got the boombox and a blunt, bootlegger deuce-deuce
H on my crew, we get drunk, a little cuckoo
Type of dudes who square up and knock a tooth loose
Quick to the basement, the, the, the basement
That is the window I'm planning to vacate with
Pops put on bars just in case somebody breaks in
That's not gonna stop me from getting to the pavement
Shh, meeting Jerome at the bus stop
I got the bigger roll, paranoid buck cops
And all my city's known for grunge, flannel, butt rock
And a bunch of Sub Pop, I was on that Buckshot

[Hook: Macklemore]
Window to window and wall to wall
Can of Krylon and we out to bomb (Buckshot)
Four in the morning, I'm with the squad
There we go, there we go, there we go, there we go
Window to window and wall to wall
Can of Krylon and we out to bomb
Four in the morning, I'm with the squad
There we go, there we go, there we go, there we go

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Just copped that new Boot Camp tape
The neighbors keep complaining 'bout too much bass
Bang, bang, let me do my thing
Give me two cans and you gon' know my name
You don't wanna get involved
You know I be on these overpasses burning bridges, dog
You know I be dippin' through these alleys tryna diss the law
Sixteen with Adidas on
I'm too speedy for police I'm chiefin' through these streets, I'm gone
I got game, don't need to talk anymore
Boppity-bo, tippity-toppity, I pop me some more
I was underground where he come from and he pop out a hole
Cracked the top back on the flat black aerosol
I woke up in the morning and I had a vision
These suit and ties got the nerve to call it vandalism
They hella mad, say my art is really bad for business
But I'ma paint a better world until the cans are empty
Now let it drip, let it drip
If they catch me doing dirt I'll plead the fifth
I pop a top, I bomb the block
Speakers bumpin', I was on that Buckshot

[Hook: Macklemore]
Window to window and wall to wall
Can of Krylon and we out to bomb (Buckshot)
Four in the morning, I'm with the squad
There we go, there we go, there we go, there we go

[Refrain: Samples (KRS-One)]
Chill-chill-chilin' with the crew
Just writing my name in graffiti on the wall
Who-who-who is he?
(Yeah, knowledge reigns supreme)
Got the world following the...

[Verse 3: KRS-One]
Turn up the CD or turn up the TV
Turn up your T-A-P-E, turn your phone up, crank up the PC
See, my boys are really beastie if you're talking graffiti
See, we call it aerosol art when we splatter the city
I got twenty-five cans in my napsack
Crossing out the whick-whack
T-O-Y-S's ain't even get that
Fat tips and black books, yo, we rep that
149th street bench is where we slept at
Clep-clap, clep-clep-clap, clep-clap
Those are not my words, the spray can said that
Where them reds at, or them green turquoise?
Where my real graf writers? Make some noise

[Outro: Samples (KRS-One)]
Chill-chill-chilin' with the crew
Just writing my name in graffiti on the wall
Who-who-who is he?
(Macklemore)
Got the world following the...
Blow blow blow blow blow
(Buckshot, shot, shot, shot)

[Verse 1]
I think happiness went that away
Sometimes you just have to wait
I never believed in God
But things got so fucked up
That I had to pray
Used to steal my Daddy's Cabernet
Never thought that it would turn into a rattlesnake
Thinkin', everything will be all right
If we could get through the week
Maybe see another Saturday
Rollin' round, we know where to go
Argue with the homies over who's gonna roll
Bumpin' Goodie Mob, have some food for the soul
Till it's two in the morn'
When rain hits the windshield
And everything is still
Nothing really is a big deal
One hand on the steering wheel
And we gon' be all right

[Verse 2]
I had a brown paper bag
St. Ides in that motherfucker
Around the city we smash
5-0 comin' then you know I'm running
Crawl into broken fences, when shit gets hard
You know who your friend is
And when I lose perspective
Need to go to a place where I lose reception
Looking at the satellites pass by
Reflecting on my past life
I can barely remember last night
Another morning, swearing it's the last time
Where would I be?
We can't start over, you don't get a new ID
I know the devil fancy me
But that don't mean the motherfucker get to dance with me

[Verse 3]
I bought a house, second guessing what I own now (What?)
Traffic moving kinda slow now (What?)
I watch the population grow wild (What?)
A bunch of people I don't know now (What?)
My city's changed and my zoned out
I thought about New York, maybe SoCal
Put up condos people can't afford now
Landmarks bulldozed, been tore down
Overpopulated but can seem like a ghost town
Keep a couple real ones with me when it goes down
Lack of diversity, I think about Sloane now
Only reason I would ever leave my hometown
If I still drink, I would crack a 40 ounce
Parents finally left, moved away, and they sold the house
It's really hard to ignore it now
Wish that we could sort it out
Last couple sips, pour it out
St. Ides

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Washing out cigarettes in the bathroom
Should probably only give my opinion when I'm asked to
I'm really good at telling the half-truth
But usually only when I have to
The money doesn't work, the chain doesn't work
Something broken in my brain, got me praying in the dirt
Got me stranded in my bed, like I'm laying in the hearse
And the grass is always greener when you play on Astroturf
Wonder why my generation poppin' pills and poppin' percs
And got some weed and got some purp
And got some bars and got some syrup
And got some Jordan's on my feet
I went and matched them with my shirt
And I just Instagrammed them both
To show you that I got them first
Got a Louis duffel bag, I got my girl a purse
I'm tryna find God through a purchase
I'm not tryna go to church
Amen, Satan told me not to serve
I only think about myself
I only think about my work
I only think about my come-up: capitalism
Look at where we come from
We are what we run from
We are why we smoke some
So numb, so numb, so numb

[Hook: Macklemore & Chance The Rapper]
I'ma tell you what you need to know
I'ma tell you what you need to hear
'Cause the truth would be too much
Yeah, the truth would be, yeah, the truth would be
I'ma tell you what you need to know
I'ma tell you what you need to hear
'Cause the truth would be too much
Yeah, the truth would be, yeah, the truth would be

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper & Macklemore]
I cry when she smile with her eyes closed
I'm already afraid of tight clothes
Want all her best friends to be white folks
I scratched out this line so many times, I can't forget it
It's fucked up, I almost say it every time that I edit
I swear rapping make it easy to lie
But secrets don't make it easy to write
I met the Devil in Manhattan, quickly ended discussion
I don't need a thing, he warned of repercussions
But I know he come in all forms, that won't be his last visit
Time is moving fast and I'm running with a pair of scissors
Looking in the mirror like, "Damn, that ain't my dad, is it?"
He handed the torch but he ain't hold my hand in it
I spent a pretty penny on microphones, mini-midis
In-ears and CDs, I put the indie in Windy City
Indian giver, black father, white liar
Right next to Yeezy like Mike Myers
Stare at the cue cards, take out the juke parts
Take out the God references, just leave the cool parts
I remember opening for Ben, wasn't no liquor at the show
And now the white girls call me nigga at my show
I wish I could open twice, sit down at the open mic
Go back to the day before I became famous overnight
I wish I could open twice, sit down at the open mic
Go back to the day before I became famous overnight

[Hook: Macklemore & Chance The Rapper]
I'ma tell you what you need to know
I'ma tell you what you need to hear
'Cause the truth would be too much
Yeah, the truth would be, yeah, the truth would be
I'ma tell you what you need to know
I'ma tell you what you need to hear
'Cause the truth would be too much
Yeah, the truth would be, yeah, the truth would be

[Outro: Macklemore]
I'ma tell you what you need to know
I'ma tell you what you need to hear
'Cause the truth would be too much
Yeah, the truth would be, yeah, the truth would be, okay

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I woke up, threw some sweat pants on
Then I fed my cat and then I walked to the mini-mart
And I really want a donut, shouldn't get a donut
Bought a donut, fuck it man it's really hard
Supposed to be on a diet, I wanna be like Ryan
He lost thirty pounds on that paleo
But fuck it man, I love fried shit
I was gonna get skinny for the summer
I was gonna start doing my crunches
But looking down at my stomach
I'ma go to the beach, but I'm not taking my shirt off in public
My girl shaped like a bottle of Coke
Me? I'm shaped like a bottle of nope
I'd like to order a hot dog, some bonbons
A large soda, and some tacos to go

[Interlude: Macklemore]
I never knew what a carbohydrate was
Turns out that it's all the snacks I love

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I wanna be like Hugh Jackman, you know jacked, man
With a really huge package
I wanna be the 2015 Batman
And send Ben Affleck packing
If you ain't gonna treat Jennifer Garner right
You don't deserve to have that
You better pass that to the homie Matt Damon
He'd eat the booty like Pac Man
(Pac Man)

[Chorus: Xperience]
You know I feel good about this place
You know I feel good about this steak
You know I feel good about this shake
You know I feel good about these plates
You know I feel good about these crepes
You know I feel good about this cake
You know I just love how it tastes
I'm not gonna wait, I'm not tripping about my weight, no

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Happy New Years
Everybody got a resolution
But the next day, we forget about it, never do 'em
I went to the gym and got a membership
Five minutes on the treadmill and I never lift
That was four years ago I should probably cancel this
But they tell me I gotta do it in person, ain't that a bitch?
But tomorrow though, I'ma get fit
Get me a fuel band and a fit-bit
Get me some workout shoes, and a bench press
Some Lulu Lemons and a french press
I'ma finally focus, do some private yoga
Exercise my shoulders, I'ma hide the donuts
Realign my posture, no time for sofas
I'm finally sober, no lime Coronas
But again, that's tomorrow
And today, man, I gotta go in cause it's my last day
Before I lose that weight, I gotta get one last plate and go big
I ate all night, Kool-Aid on ice
I woke up and I felt like shit
And said, "You know what, man, fuck it
I should probably start on Monday instead"
Motherfucker let's eat

[Chorus: Xperience]
You know I feel good about this place
You know I feel good about this steak
You know I feel good about this shake
You know I feel good about these plates
You know I feel good about these crepes
You know I feel good about this cake
You know I just love how it tastes
I'm not gonna wait, I'm not tripping about my weight, no

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I never won the spelling bee
I could read people's energy
Listen to what have been said to me
Heard the voices in elementary
That I wouldn't amount to anything
Ol' girl, she used to beg to me
Like, if we just had a nice house and a mortgage
And a front lawn, and a fucking wedding ring
I danced in Paris, shed my shell
Swam in oceans, felt the scales
Put my CD in Starbucks, it did not sell
Get the CD out the car trunk and did it myself
These piano keys hold some weight
In a bolo tie, I escort my date
She ordered shrimp scampi on a porcelain plate
The accordion played, I put my fork in a steak
Afternoons need a coffee boost
Attitude needs a confidence boost
Yeah, I'm sort of the dude
But where's the self-esteem when the costumes removed?
Thanks for the invite, can't make it
I could blame it on a flight to Vegas
But, truth be told, rather not socialize
And go and waste my time with an acquaintance
These relationships need maintenance
Everybody got expectations
Text back, so impatient
Where were you when I was an in-patient?

[Hook: Macklemore]
Motherfucker, you ain't my account
You don't know what I'm doing
Focusing on what I'm giving back
Man, make better music
Fuck preaching on top of the mountain
People can see through it
Keeping my name in your mouth
Just don't bite your tongue while you chew it

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Exactly, I got the man of the year
Source Magazine was like our Vanity Fair
In a mansion, picking out a chandelier
But got a bone to pick with the man in the mirror
Questioning the purchase while I'm standing there
Questioning the purpose of my rap career
Thinking "Man, what the hell happened here?"
Feels like yesterday in a van packing gear
What am I gonna go and give back this year?
There's a whole lot of struggling rappers here
Want a co-sign and a whole track this year
If you know motherfuckers start acting weird
Lot of backstabbers and some actors here
Lot of has-beens and over-reactors here
I remember laughing and cracking beers
Now I climbed the ladder and you're mad I'm here

[Hook: Macklemore (YG)]
Motherfucker, you ain't my account
You don't know what I'm doing
Focusing on what I'm giving back
Man, make better music
Fuck preaching on top of the mountain
People can see through it
Keeping my name in your mouth
Just don't bite your tongue while you chew it
(400)
Motherfucker, I'm gone

[Verse 3: YG]
Judging me off of my past
You don't see what I'm doing
When I got shot that was headline news
Y'all used me for views, I ain't stupid
Cause what about all the good?
The non-profit for the kids in the hood
That ain't got no option in them shelter homes plotting
Shit, I'm just doing what I should
They must want no one to know
Cause they don't put that on the news, bro
They entertained by the culture, they vultures
They suck us like leeches 'til we broke
But I know the game, so I play it like chess
Act like a square, but really be the threat
The next time my name in the press
Talk about how YG gave them kids Christmas

[Hook: YG]
Motherfucker, you ain't my account
You don't know what I'm doing
Focused on what I'm giving back
Man, make good music
Preaching on top of the mountain
People can see through it
Keeping my name in your mouth
Just don't bite your tongue while you chew it
Motherfucker, I'm gone

[Outro: Macklemore (YG)]
Fuck, hey, woo
Motherfucker, I'm gone
(Four, four, four...)
Hey where'd he go though?
(400)
Motherfucker, I'm gone
(I am the victim not the motherfuckin' suspect)
And he's gone, gone

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Pretty face tryna chase the train
And I could look the other way but it still won't erase the pain
And I pray that she stay the same, amazing grace
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just another reflection in the window
Watchin' the trees pass by at a tempo
Got a round trip ticket out to limbo
And I'm getting close to my kinfolk
I'm sorry that you didn't get the memo
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Water under burned bridges
Always on the road tryna earn a livin'
I remember when I bought my first ticket
I've been going, haven't turned back since then
This return day must be a misprint
Made a wrong turn now I'm long distance
And I miss them

[Hook: Carla Morrison]
Otra ciudad, otra vida, otra, otra ciudad, ah, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I try to write but every sentence is a run on
I try to text you but I don't get reception in this tunnel
Vision, visit only for a minute
I'm gettin' on track but the wheels still spinnin'
You can see the smoke in the distance, it billows
Roll up my sweatshirt, turn it into a pillow, ay
I got a polaroid camera so I don't forget where I travel
I got a couple rolls of film I'll get developed when I get back to Seattle
I told momma that I'd call her, talked for a couple minutes
But I didn't
I miss my brother, feel disconnected
Wanted to stay, wanted to catch the next one
I wanted to talk, just me and him
Because I had some things I felt I had to tell him
When you're always runnin', tryna make a connection
It's almost impossible to stay connected
When you get on this train after standin' in the rain
You'd be crazy to exit
And give your seat to the next one, nah
I'ma ride this shit 'til the wheels fall off
The conductor screams out, "All aboard, last call"
The city as you pass on, the city as you pass on

[Hook: Carla Morrison]
Otra ciudad, otra vida, otra, otra ciudad, ah, oh, oh, oh
(Oh, now I can feel it.
Man, I can't.
Oh yeah, I feel it now, too.
Oh my gosh, wicked man! Whoa!
Oh dear, boys, I'm afraid this is some vintage bad stuff.
I've never felt anything like it.
Ay yai yai.)

[Verse 1]
Please, don't cry
I'll tell you why
I may have moved
I still love you

[Chorus]
I don't know
Where it is I'll go
Somewhere new
As long as it's like you

They'll be well
I can tell
Oh

[Verse 2]
Where he goes
With love to show
For you, my dear
He's staying here

[Chorus]
I don't know
Where it is I'll go
Somewhere new
As long as it's like you

You'll be well
I can tell
See you 'round

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Critical thinking
A sea of souls selling out
But this ship is sinking
Flooded with watered down lyrics
With subliminal meanings
To wake up another day
Lord, give me a reason
Are these prayers really working
Or just triggering feelings, feelings, feelings, feelings
I vocalize my pain and they say, "Isn't it genius?"
I'd be considered a legend if I consistently bring it
Now is there life after death or just recall and repeat it
Or does it go pitch dark and just dissolve into pieces?
If that's the case I wonder if I departed this evening
From the top of the 47th and just fall to the cement
For the entire police quadrant and fire department to see it
Would my disembodied soul then reach its path of completion
Or just create another scene
In which to deal with these demons
Not to sound morbid, my views are just distorted and grungy
I should cry myself to sleep
On this mattress made out of money
But I'm not here to be liked, I'm not here to be nice
I'm not here for your war, I'm not here for your fight
I'm not here to be hyped, I'm not here for a price
When I bring you the truth it's not delivered polite
Gamblin with my life you shouldn't have gave me the dice, dice, Dice
You shouldn't have gave me the dice, dice, dice
All this misery shrouded in mystery of violent history
THC chemistry
Cure for depression
No there is no remedy
Allergic to bullshit, no antihistamine
Top of the class haters graduate to enemies
Out on your ass is where they intended for you to be
Snakes in the grass, I'll cut them out, eventually
Slave to the media, you got to be kidding me
You got to be kidding me
You got to be fucking kidding me..

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Yeah
And we live in a state of confusion
I hear what they say on the news
They usually just laying a blueprint
Used to create a delusion
Movies to sway your conclusion
Used to delay your awakening
Steady creating illusions
Clues to mistaken the truth with
No sense debating with fools
Who put all of their faith in the skewed philosophy
With situational views
Too many saviors to choose
I stare at the face of the moon
Too much information
Too many equations
It's too complicated to prove
Stories portrayed we consume
Like thanksgiving tables of food
I'm sorry not sorry
I ain't in the mood
To dress up and play in this room
You can judge me and say that it's cruelty
I see the chains and the whip
I just don't mistake it for jewelry
Fuck out my face now, excuse me
I ain't got no patience today so excuse me

Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking
Looking
Looking

[Chorus: Drake]
Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All in the same thing
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge

[Verse 1: Drake]
To do what you couldn't do
Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in
They bulletproof
Minus twenty we in Pitfield
That Kai's kitchen in a Canada Goose
Famous as fuck but I’m still in the cut when they round up the troops
I’m just a sicko, a real sicko when you get to know me nigga
I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest? I expect you to aim for the head
I coulda killed you the first time
You don’t have to try and say it louder nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
It’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones
You know Chubbs like Draymond
You better off not saying nothing
Them boys they a handful
Then I hit ‘em with the Hotline
Chris Breezy with the dance moves
Mo-G with the dance moves
Ave Boy with the dance moves
Jimi Hendrix with the solo
Those are strings that you can’t pull
Yeah, and I could really dish it out
Come and get it from the source
Fuck with all the word of mouth
Golden State running practice at my house
Nigga, what am I about?
You gon’ really feel it now
I’m out here…

[Chorus: Drake]
Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge

All you boys in the new Toronto want to be me a little
All your exes know I like my O’s with a V in the middle
You would love it if I went away or didn’t say nothing else
How am I keeping it real by keeping this shit to myself?
You was never gang, gang, gang, gang, you was never one of us
Had us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up
But I’m better off anyway, y’all never gon’ finish Drake
Say you seeing ‘bout it when you see me man y’all never home anyway
Thought of things that you shoulda said, said things that you shouldn’t say
We even gave y'all the whole money play and y'all broke to this day
“Oh it’s your time now” yeah, that’s what everybody say
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA, now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Ye’s pool is nice, mine's just bigger's what I’m saying
I’m that nigga’s what I’m saying
Getting things done around here
How you let me run it down here?
I’m not even from around here
Six, six, six, six, six, soon as I’m back in the city they throw a parade
I might get a key to the city and give it to Wayne
Or give it to one of the young boys to carry the wave
Yeah, so trust me, they’ll be out here…

[Chorus: Drake]
Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All repping one thing
Looking for...

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
They don’t want us to have a bigger pool than Kanye

[Intro: Future]
I'm slippin', I'm fallin'
I gotta get up
I'm slippin', I'm fallin'
I can't get up
But I'm slippin', I'm fallin'
I gotta get up
I'm slippin', I was fallin'
Yeah I bet I'll get up
I'm slippin', I'm fallin'
I know I'm gettin' up
I'm slippin', I'm fallin'
I better get up
But I'm slippin', I'm fallin'
I gotta get up

[Chorus: Future]
Use that money for motivation
Them same ones that came up with me hatin'
When money talkin', it can change a conversation
They'd rather see me locked in shackles, watch me take off
I'm dedicated, but I'm runnin' out of patience
Hopin' these pain pills take away frustration
We drinkin' lean and pourin' up until the eighth gone
On medication, me and Satan conversatin'

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Okay that lean had me slippin', damn dawg you trippin'
Had to tell my niggas and stay focused on the mission
Now we at the Grammys, started in the kitchen
And I brought the family, fuck them other niggas
Cause ain't nobody listen when I told 'em I would blow
Now the VIP be crowded every city that I go
Shorty said she like my style, I be thinkin', "Yeah I know"
Would've never gave me play back in the day when I was broke
So I ball hard, post it on the 'Gram just to motivate 'em
When you're gettin' money, niggas' broke, they supposed to hate it
Hurt my heart when I seen my closest homie caught the vapors
Gotta watch 'em closely, backstabbers didn't poke me
Shot me, brought me down on my knees, tried to Derrick Rose me
Won 'em a ring, still did me like I was Kobe
Talked down on me when they thought that I slipped
You niggas crazy if you thought I would quit, no!

[Chorus: Future]
Use that money for motivation
Them same ones that came up with me hatin'
When money talkin', it can change a conversation
They'd rather see me locked in shackles, watch me take off
I'm dedicated, but I'm runnin' out of patience
Hopin' these pain pills take away frustration
We drinkin' lean and pourin' up until the 8th gone
On medication, me and Satan conversatin'

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Yo, bein' broke is so embarrassin', got sick of wastin' time
I took some packages to Maryland
Me and Leek, couple pounds of tree in the caravan
Before I ever wrote a rhyme, I had a scam
Might have been young, but I had a plan
I wanted designer clothes
Pooch was in the kitchen with a lot of coke
I wanted this money since a snotty nose
We was in the staircase, watchin' fiends driftin' off
Now it's Teterboro flyin' private jets, liftin' off
Tell the pilot I just need to know when we about to land
I was watchin' Ds sendin' out them vans
Stashed a couple pieces in my Nike sock
Never could I like a cop
My man ain't know his mother used to like to cop
Damn, homie
A Cuban chain and a Rollie'll make your man switch
Same one you flipped grams with and split your sandwich
Meek told me just get this money and motivate 'em
It's no debatin', if you broke we ain't got no relation
Harlem!

[Chorus: Future]
Use that money for motivation
Them same ones that came up with me hatin'
When money talkin', it can change a conversation
They'd rather see me locked in shackles, watch me take off
I'm dedicated, but I'm runnin' out of patience
Hopin' these pain pills take away frustration
We drinkin' lean and pourin' up until the 8th gone
On medication, me and Satan conversatin'

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Location: Toronto; Status: five star hotel, Four Seasons. Them chumps right upstairs, they know not to come down here playin' no real niggas. Mood: I'm still up countin' five hundred thousand cash. Nicki in the bedroom sleep, life is good

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I've been in my cell for a week straight
Locked down 24, no more Philip's Steak
Damn, shit's so real it seems fake
Damn, let me take 'em to the green gate
When we was sellin' white girl
Audemar shinin' like it need a light bill
These niggas dick ride like they don't even like girls
A hundred thousand for the jet, yeah that's the flight bill
Damn, cost four bricks to go to the LIV nigga
Whole squad on some shit, that's how we live nigga
Twenty-five bad bitches what we did nigga
That's fifty different Louboutins bleedin' red nigga
Whew, I ain't blood and I ain't crippin' neither
On the phone with the plug talkin' Justin Bieber
I made a milly last week and I ain't touch it neither
Straight cash tryna give 'em straight gas
Catch you out in Brooklyn, get your chain tookin'
My Philly boys'll creep up on you when you ain't lookin'
With your lil memes, I be with the real queen
Screamin' free the real Preme, we be doin' real things
Pull up with a bad bitch, whippin' somethin' real mean
Marchin' all these fuckin' drums on me like a drill team
I be with my young niggas, all they know is kill things
Don't make me make a real scene, uh
See an OVO chain, probably take that shit
Said dreamin' wasn't enough, we had to chase that shit
You ain't write it' nigga, we caught ya, can't erase that shit
And you claimin' you HOV now? Why you state that shit?
Man I hate that shit, niggas be talkin' out they face
But soon as you body somethin' they be singin' like they Drake
Wait, niggas dancin' like they fruitcakes
Hotline Bling don't get no bing up in this new Wraith
Pull up on the plug, swap that bag with the suitcase
DC4 on the way, that's nigga's due date
Robbed you in your city and you told
Tory from the 6, you hatin' on him, Lord knows
Culture vulture, now it's time to pay the tolls
Soft as the lacrosse team, boy that's word to HOV
No reply, word to God I'm on the floor still
Me and Nicki watchin' the Sixers, I'm closin' more deals
Dreamchasers' double MG, we got the door sealed
Roc Nation, Atlantic Records, I'm on my fourth deal
When I met you, you was on my dick
Asked me to hold the DC chain, now you on some shit
Omelly told me get it back cause he's like "boy's a bitch"
And I'm like, let him get it took cause we gon' charge 'em trips

[Interlude: Meek Mill & Omelly]
Fuckboy, huh charge you triple the way this real nigga stamp. Chasers, ahh. Location: Philly; Mood: Glock with 30; Status: triple OG, never been disrespected without retaliation, chump

[Verse 2: Omelly & Meek Mill]
I've been in the hood for like a year straight
Sippin' dirty, it be hard for me to stand straight
Damn, it's time to cut the dead weight
I'm tryna turn my CLS into a red Wraith
When I was sellin' hard crack you was scared straight
I dropped 9 and bought the Rollie with the red face
Meek the one that got the mil, the one that got the deal
I'm still lampin' with the shooters and they poppin' pills
These niggas like to rap diss they get popped for real
It's time to son these pussy rappers, I'm their pop for real
I'm the type to fuck your mom cause she's a thot for real
And I ain't got one, my pump playin' shotgun
Quarterback that Glock, Cam Newton, and you catch a hot one
And for the fam I'll keep shootin' until the cops come
Reload, double back, hold up cuz, I got one
Official only respect official and you are not one
No, we are not them, we be on some other shit
Deep in them trenches, duckin' narcotics and the government
Tracin' the dollar, flippin' that product, tryna double shit
Chewing like it's double mint
Man, who you niggas fuckin' with?

[Outro: Omelly]
Hah, hey Meek Mill man, I'ma start running down on these niggas too. Real rap, these niggas soft and they frauds, check DC record nigga, we flawless. Any nigga stepped up to the fuckin' plate got rolled over. I ain't just talkin' to be talkin', nigga, check the resume. How many times we got to fuck the city up for you niggas to pay homage. Fuck you niggas talking bout nigga? Slide through 20 deep, I'm talkin' bout 7 Rolls Royces, 3 Maybachs, 20 Rollies, 30 Cubans, 25 bad bitches, 25 Chanel bags, 6 Caddie trucks, jumbo jets. Stop playin' nigga, we came from nothin'

[Chorus: Tdot Illdude]
I be getting money fucking hoes
Hundred bands on me everywhere I go
Lot of things on me everywhere I go
If you on the other side, then you got to go
Bruce Lee Roy, I got the glow
Diamonds dancing in my chain it come from Joe
Hundred bands on me everywhere I go
Lot of niggas hating but they keep it on the low
I keep my bitch in Celine that's fa sho
I keep my bitch in Vera Wang, that's fa sho
I keep my hittas on the plane, that's fa sho
And the streets know my names, that's fa sho, sho

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I've been getting money on the low
Type of nigga buy a Birken for your hoe
Hundred thousand on me everywhere I go
Bought a Range just to drive it in the snow
Fuck you, niggas, talking shit is lit
Riding dirty got the chopper in the Bent
Got your baby momma trying to get a flick
Now nigga, tell your baby momma fuck up off my dick
I'm just cooling with my young niggas
She in the VIP with all these drug dealers
Acting like she never fucked with you
And she told me that you a fuck nigga
When you popping like we popping, my nigga, ain't no laying low
Mixing that Givenchy with Valentino camo
Fuck on the air mattress all in the bando
Dabbing like I'm Cam tho
Touchdown, yeah, hoe

[Chorus: Tdot Illdude]
I be getting money fucking hoes
Hundred bands on me everywhere I go

And the streets know my name, that's fa sho, sho

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yea, mobbing at the clear port
Richard Mille all plain like the airport
Therefore I am flyer than an air force
Looking devilish I pull up in that red Porsche
Now we got your bitch up on the money train
I heard she fucking what's his name and what's his name
We only know your wifey by her Twitter name
I only pop the perc, so I don't feel the pain
Feel the pain, feel the pain, make them feel the flame
All these corny niggas winning, I don't know who to blame
But maybe its the internet, I've been busy counting money, you should do the same
Every nigga 'round me got a body
Shorty with me trying to kick it like karate
In my DM acting thirsty, word to Gotti
And it be going down when I pull up to the party

[Chorus: Tdot Illdude]
I be getting money fucking hoes
Hundred bands on me everywhere I go
Lot of things on me everywhere I go
If you on the other side then you got to go
Bruce Lee Roy, I got the glow
Diamonds dancing in my chain it come from Joe
Hundred bands on me everywhere I go
Lot of niggas hating but they keep it on the low
I keep my bitch in Celine, that's fa sho
I keep my bitch in Vera Wang, that's fa sho
I keep my hittas on the plane, that's fa sho
And the streets know my names, that's fa sho, sho

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I'm still balling, money still calling
I'm on my eighth Rollie, niggas still talking
Flood the whole band, it look like real water
Ticket after ticket I feel like I'm will calling
Niggas hating on me, I don't feel for 'em
'Cause my South Philly niggas kill at will for 'em
And my North Philly niggas do the drill for 'em
The lawyers paid nigga made me spend a mil on 'em, pussy!
Blow the motherfucking money on these niggas

[Chorus: Tdot Illdude]
I be getting money fucking hoes
Hundred bands on me everywhere I go
Lot of things on me everywhere I go
If you on the other side then you got to go
Bruce Lee Roy, I got the glow
Diamonds dancing in my chain it come from Joe
Hundred bands on me everywhere I go
Lot of niggas hating but they keep it on the low
I keep my bitch in Celine, that's fa sho
I keep my bitch in Vera Wang, that's fa sho
I keep my hittas on the plane, that's fa sho
And the streets know my names, that's fa sho, sho

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Chopsquad
How many of y'all niggas wanna go against me?
We kill all you mothafuckin' haters
You know how long it took me to get here and y'all niggas still talkin'?
R.I.P. to Lil Snupe
Chopsquad DJ on the beat so it's a banger!

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
You wanna see a dead body, come roll with Ricky
My wrist and neck cost a Bugatti, I'm smokin' sticky
They think I'm in Illuminati, thought that I was sinnin'
Shit, all them years that I was starvin', and now I'm filthy
I wanna see my haters dead, talkin' bloody murder
Cause when it's beef I give 'em bread and make a fucking burger
And every time I hear 'em shooting, I get fucking nervous
We put them Ghosts back to back, it look like fucking hearses
Killing niggas, kill them all, funeral stickers
Lord please forgive them they not know what I do to these niggas
Be with pirañas in the water to chew through these niggas
They killed my homie we came back and hit two of them niggas

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Lord, please forgive them they not know
Lord, please forgive them they not know
Lord, please forgive them they not know
And when we hit them bless their souls
The devil coming  and I seen it
We fear Allah only I mean it
And Inshallah my soul the cleanest
Committed sins and I redeemed it
Lord please forgive them they not know (we let 'em go if they not know)
Lord please forgive them they not know (we let 'em go if they not know)
Lord please forgive them they not know (we let 'em go if they not know)
And when we hit them bless they souls (lord)

[Interlude: Dex Osama]
I done seen the motherfucking reaper standing over me
Momma crying like "You gotta change your life son. You got death on you and shit."
I'm like, "Damn!" you hip?
I'm like I'm about to die but I don't know when
I just know I'm about to die soon, you hip?
Like this motherfucker just came and gave me a visit

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Look in my eyes, what do you see?
Heart of a killer I pull up they looking surprised, what could it be?
Is it the money, the hoes, I'm feeling the vibe, I'm still in the streets
And shoutout to niggas that's still on my side cause niggas capisce
So it's any means necessary, no love not in February
They gave my dawg life so he come home like a Nevuary
Was never scary I hit the lights and say, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary
Lately, I been lurking where the reaper creeping we been creeping
Hit a nigga 20 times, leave him sleeping, see him leaking, we the reason
He was fresh to death like it was Easter weekend
Mama selling dinner platters when that boy got hit with ladders
No insurance, no informants, close the case
Open casket I'm like how they closed his face
And I got cake and I can't lie I cannot wait to stop back by and set y'all straight

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Lord, please forgive them they not know
Lord, please forgive them they not know
Lord, please forgive them they not know
And when we hit them bless they souls
The devil coming and I seen it
We fear Allah only I mean it
And Inshallah my soul the cleanest
Committed sins and I redeemed it
Lord please forgive them they not know (let them go if they not know)
Lord please forgive them they not know (let them go if they not know)
Lord please forgive them they not know (let them go if they not know)
And when we hit them bless they souls

[Verse 1]
You may call it in this evening
But you've only lost the night
Present all your pretty feelings
May they comfort you tonight
And I'm climbing over something
And I'm running through these walls
And I'm climbing over something
And I'm running through these walls

[Refrain]x2
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe

Everything you're trying to say to me

I had the strangest feeling
Your world's not all it seems
So tired of misconceiving
What else this could've been

[Refrain]

[Bridge]
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind

I don't even know if I (x8)

Umm you betta walk that shit
I ain't really gotta talk that shit
Cause by the end of the night you'll be doing shit that I like
Hell yea fucking right

[Chorus:]
Girl you betta wear dat shit
Can't nobody wear like you
You betta walk dat shit
Can't nobody walk it like you do
Make it funky for me
Do dat shit that I
Do dat shit that I like
Do dat shit that I
Do dat shit that I like
You know what I'm talking bout'
The tongue with the thing and the stuff
Don't stop don't stop
Baby don't stop I can't get enough I'm bout it
Do dat shit
Do dat shit that I like
Do dat shit
Do dat shit that I like
You know what I'm talking bout'
The tongue with the thing and the stuff
Don't stop don't stop
Baby don't stop I can't get enough I'm bout it

[Outro:]
Do dat shit dat I (do dat shit that I like)
Do dat shit dat I (do dat shit that I like)
You know what I'm talking bout
Don't stop don't stop don't stop don't stop don't stop I can't get enough im bout it
Do dat shit dat I (do dat shit that I like)
Do dat shit that I like
The tongue with the thing and the stuff
Don't don't don't stop I can't get enough im bout it

[Chorus]
Ohh it's a funny game
Don't believe that it's all the same
About that flat thing that I just said
Was cause there's something upon my head

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Riding fastlane with the top back
Speeding no brakes where the gas at
Crooked ass cop put your cap back
So you already know where the strap at
Man you already know we in beast mode
Man you already know a nigga pass that
Everybody false flaggin', man you already a nigga blessed
You already know, you already know
You already know, you already know
I could tell you cause you already know
You already know, you already know
You already know, you already know
I could tell you, but you already know

[Verse 2]
I'm sick of running with my hands up
I'm just fucking all they bands up
Simple man I don't demand much
I'm just trying to roll these grams up
What you wanted me to say to you?
Give you something to awaken you
Find a topic that's conveyable?
A prophecy that's inescapable?
This the world that they portray to you
Sovereignty is unattainable
Justice, too, is unavailable
The judge's ruling is persuadable
Slavery is generational
Who you worship, who you praying to?
Watch these fakers what they say to you
You see the truth it's unmistakable (Naw)
They wouldn't lie to me, dawg (Naw)
They wouldn't lie to me, bro (Naw)
They wouldn't lie to the world (Naw)
They wouldn't lie under oath (Right?)
No man can be high as the law (I guess)
The law that was sworn to uphold (I guess)
It's too late, the door has been closed (uh-huh)
Too many stories' been told
Bandz

[Chorus]
Ohh it's a funny game
Don't believe that it's all the same
About that flat thing that I just said
Was cause there's something upon my head

[Verse 3]
Started out for the love of the song
Woke up and saw the blood on the phone
Woke up and seen the sun, it was cold
Wondering where the fuck did I go wrong?
Where has the time gone, where has the time gone?
Lost in the time zone, must got the time wrong
Where does the time go?
I don't wanna die alone, don't wanna die alone, die alone

[Verse 4]
At a glance, you'll never truly understand
Cascading thoughts will form an avalanche
Eventually the shit gonna hit the fan
Niggas that sick of suffering got demands
Climb up the mountain just so we can stand
Big brother hang you off it by your pants
No more allegiance to no more leaders
To people that put the law above the land
It's a scam like Iraq and Iran, Afghanistan
Created targets, create the martyrs
Democracy artists, good hearted people enlisted to fight
For this system that stripped all your rights
And the bitches delivered in doses so potent that when they’re administered people turn sinister
The retina, the all seeing retina
The mark of the beast, the mark of the predator
God bless, God bless America, god bless the regular
Far from the regular
Don't kill the messenger
Bandz

[Chorus]
Ohh it's a funny game
Don't believe that it's all the same
About that flat thing that I just said
Was cause there's something upon my head

Ride in that lane with the top back
Speeding no brakes where the gas at
Crooked ass cop put your cap back
So you already know what a strap back
Man you already know when you in beast mode
Man you already know a nigga pass that
Everybody false flaggin', man you already know a nigga blessed

(x2)
You already know, you already know
You already know, you already know
I could tell you cause you already know
You already know, you already know
You already know, you already know
I could tell you, but you already know
You already know, you already know
You already know, you already know

[Intro]
My momma ain't raise no fool nigga
Matter of fact, maybe she did (ha ha ha)
My momma raised a fool (haha)
But that don't mean we can't get rich(rich)
Too rich (too rich, too rich too rich)
That's what they say(they say, ah ah ah ah)

[Verse 1]
Humble beginnings, rich ass endings
Pockets on swole, big ass benjies
Started off losin', man it wasn't choosin'
Stuck with my nigga's, now we all winnin'
Rollin' up paper, ball like a Laker
Top on the building, I'm high as a 'scraper
What can I say now, cops know my name now
No time to play 'round, I'm rich and I'm paid now
Stay on that peaceful shit for nigga's that spray rounds
Hear all the talk, they gon' come see you any day now
Try not to fade out, try to find a way out
Nobodies innocent nigga, get down or lay down
Made so much money but look how much I'd paid out
Don't trust the bank no more so I went and got a safe in my house
Guess all these diamonds on my wrist, what you blinkin' about
It's all my money on my mind when I'm thinkin' about

[Hook]
Try to be the best that I can
Make all the right decisions, handle business like a man( It try)
You know I try to do shit with my heart
They talk but I don't listen
I just finish what I start
You know I tried the nigga's that said I can't (I try)
They got the right decisions, handle business like a man
You know I try when people tell me (I try) I should change
Sometimes I'm done with trying, I'm just trying to be the same

[Verse 2]
Nigga's still hating, critics still waiting
Said that I'd change my ways and start catching these cases
But never said I'd stop counting these faces
Flyin' new places, buying them cases
Nigga's want problems, I don't entertain it
Cause if it's real problems, It's not entertainment
I'm rollin' a joint up, precise like a painter
The grind is what made us, the grind is what made us
Now the nigga's that I grew up with lookin' richer
Too much turnin' up, the club owners tryin' to censor
Tatted everywhere  my full body full of scriptures
Pull up in the phantom, paparazzi takin' pictures (pictures)
Sellin' so much swag, we should be your swag vender (Vender)
Big winner in the club, big cash spender
Throwin' signs to my man like he a damn pitcher
Some shit you can't witness, my nigga we been business

[Hook]
Try to be the best that I can (I try)
They got the right decisions, handle business like a man (I try)
You know I try to do shit with my heart
They talk but i don't listen
I just finish what I start(I try)
You know I tried the nigga's that said I can't (Itry)
They got the right decisions, handle business like a man (Itry)
You know I try when people say I should change
Sometimes I'm done with trying, I'm just trying to be the same

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
This shit ain't as easy as it looks nigga
It's way fucking easier
Don't get it twisted bitch
But on some real shit though

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Man these niggas don't want it
Riding in the car and the watch cost the same thing
Nigga that's stuntin'
Gettin' all this paper
Got me shittin' in public
That roof with a city view
I did that from nothing
And these niggas gon' keep hating me
But I'm just gonna keep stackin' up
No one thing I'll never change
I talk shit but I back it up
You niggas don't go hard as me
So why the fuck you mad at us
I'm rolling up the bombest weed
The first one wasn't fat enough
Your car don't go fast enough
You don't fly first class enough
You don't do no switching states
You don't do no packing up
All you do is gassin' up
That's why you wasn't past enough
Smokin' weed and crackin' up
All this cheese I'm racking up

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Courtney Noelle]
See one thing about me
I've always been about mine
As soon as you doubt me
I show you how hard I grind
Yeah I hear they hate me
But they do it all the time
There's no you without me
I know this so I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Get it how I live it
Get it and don't care how I spend it
Swear to god, my credit card ain't got no limit
Time expensive so I spent hundred thousand on my watches
Full of diamonds
I ain't even reached the top and I'm still climbing
I'm still climbing
I'm still rhyming
Filling up papers with chronic
Keeping niggas out the way
Who got the hating shit in common
Let's be honest
Let's keep it real here
My bank is full of commas
I'm talkin' millions
And I got no problems
Spending what I spent yeah
Cause I'm probably
The realest nigga in here
Matter of fact I know I am
And I know my diamonds are frozen
Not to mention my bank overflowin'
And I just can't stop, I keep goin'

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Courtney Noelle]
See one thing about me
I've always been about mine
As soon as you doubt me
I show you how hard I grind
Yeah I hear they hate me
But they do it all the time
There's no you without me
I know this so I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go

[Intro]
Yeah it’s real shit
Let me roll this weed up and wrap this shit, you know
Too much purple for me

[Verse 1]
Uh, coming up I always thought I’d be the runner up
Gave my all but it felt like it wasn’t enough
I remember spending summers in the studio
My pops told me have fun be a kid for once
What he ain’t know, was for a kid a that I had big dreams
I take a small frame turn it into a big screen
Taking best friends turn them to a good team
I’m watching Scarface living all the good scenes
Burning dope thinking about the days when I was broke
Desperate niggas in my city don’t know how to cope
Young nigga said he starving he ain’t got a meal
Down to catch a body all about a dollar bill
My niggas is all I got so it’s more than trust
We ain’t even have a car we was on the bus
Public transportation now it’s hundred grands we makin'
Throw it in the safe I can’t hear what they say

[Hook]
I’m packing up my bags
Packing up my bags, packing up my bags
I gotta catch a plane
Gotta catch a plane, gotta catch a plane
I can’t be at home
Can’t be at home, can’t be at home
I gotta be away
Gotta be away, gotta be away

[Verse 2]
There's just way to many niggas i use to know back in the day
Now when i see them out
I just don't got shit to say to you niggas
When i see you in the club i make my way through you niggas
You must be mad i ain't wait on you
But no matter the circumstances i never get hate on you
Im just taking all my dream trying to make it facts
Putting on for my team trying to make it crack
Getting all sorts of green trying to make a stack
Lose yourself in my city and never make it back
Said he will but the chances are he will never change
Daddy sold dope but you would probably do the same thing
If I get $30K i would probably spend it on my wrist
Fuck these politics when these kids ain't have a pot to piss
Fuck the Promises, the shit I'm on is common sense
If you ain't talking them I'm gone

[Hook]
I’m packing up my bags
Packing up my bags, packing up my bags
I gotta catch a plane
Gotta catch a plane, gotta catch a plane
I can’t be at home
Can’t be at home, can’t be at home
I gotta be away
Gotta be away, gotta be away

[Outro] (conversation between Wiz and Sebastian)
Say "hello, my name is Sebastian"
Hello, my name is Sebastian
Do you love your daddy?

[Intro]
One time

[Verse 1]
Yeah, day after day I just stay here
Waiting for you to get home
Lately I been going crazy
Can’t wait to get in my zone
Sometimes I can’t find your number
And there’s no one else to call
You leave me waiting by the phone
You keep me high, that’s for sure

[Hook]
But I know, you’ll be there when I need you
I can’t place no one above you
I tried but I can’t get enough of your love
And you’re right there for me
Said I was just hoping you called
I was just hoping you called
To say that you don’t have nothing at all
I was just hoping you called

[Verse 2]
They try and try but can’t top you
They think they come close but they fall
They see me out, give me offers
I don’t feel nothing at all

[Hook]
But I know, you’ll be there when I need you
I can’t place no one above you
I tried but I can’t get enough of your love
And you’re right there for me
Said I was just hoping you called
I was just hoping you called
To say that you don’t have nothing at all
I was just hoping you called

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Woke up feeling like a star
Get it in no matter where we are
She in love with me press buttons up in my car
My weed smoke hella potent
Riding and the sunroof open
Blowing smoke out what they know about
Being bosses, taking losses
Pay the cost to fuck that bitch, who got that poke out
My money ain't slow, got more trees to roll
Got a son I love to death, I gotta see him grow
Probably the best you've seen but I be on the low
Stacking up, rolling marijuana, acting up
Bitch with me, she be bad as fuck
Bitches love it, niggas mad at us
Getting money, that's accurate
Say they want it but they can't adjust
Taylor Gang, roll a plane

[Hook]
Who trying to make a play

Okay i woke up on the mud

Keep OG Kush up in my lungs(whoa)
Your hoe will come with us(ay)
Cause she know we brought the drugs(ay)
And she looking for some love(ay)
But let's keep that on the hush(whoa)
It's hard to find some trust
Some say it's hard to fuck with us
That's cause we be on different shit
Bitch i might pour six up in my Crush
Ohh that's super super much
And this joint is super clutch
Got 5 more just for you to stuff
Send parents to the store for ice and cups
I swear they never frighten us
Hell yeah we always lighting up
Put that pussy on the plate it's fresh for lunch
And i pour another 8th to level up
Probably rolling up

[Verse 1]
I will let you walk to the one you love
I will let you walk to the one you love
But who is the one you love?
But tell me who is the one you love?

[Verse 2]
Who when bashed and bruised will tend your wounds?
Who will aid you with their point of view?
Oh tell me who is the one you love?
Oh tell me who is the one you love?

[Pre-Chorus]
I would hate to see you walk away
But I won't cry or beg for you to stay

[Chorus]
If you would use the one you love
You're gonna lose the one you love

[Verse 3]
Who will take you down to up above?
Who will greet you with leather gloves?
Oh, tell me who is the one you love?
Oh, tell me who is the one you love?

[Pre-Chorus]
I would hate to see you walk away
But I won't cry or beg for you to stay

[Chorus]
If you use the one you love
You're gonna lose the one you love

[Outro]
I will let you walk to the one you love

[Verse 1]
Been breaking bread with my niggas

But he ain't saying shit
I think he know who just dropped him
But he ain't saying shit
He ain't saying, he ain't saying

[Hook]
Fired up, fired up
You won't live to see the night
See the reaper in my eyes

Fired up
Bodies and remains
Flowers on the curb, flowers on the grave
You got me fucked up

[Verse 2]
Fucking with them niggas
Your momma told you stay up in the crib but you ain't listen
You gon' get fucked up
Pay attention, and play to win it boy
This ain't no

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And all that fucking screaming
Make it easier to find you
Swear that I'm the leader
Tell the sheep to get behind me
I don't carry heat but it's the people that's beside me
That I can't fucking speak for, if you feel the need to try me
Ain't been sleeping, you can see it in my eyes
But I've been drinking you can see it how I'm driving
I ain't been sleeping, you can see it in my eyes
But I've been drinking you can see it how I'm driving
Don't wanna be the reason that these grieving mothers crying
But I put that behind me, be careful who you trying
We don't mind the violence, we creeping tis' the season
That the blood and guts behind them
Flames and dust behind us

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
Champagne kinda night
All the way turnt, ain't coming down
Everything coming right
Can't nothing hold us down
I got you all lit
Drunk, tripping off the sound
But you came here to get down

[Pre-Chorus: Timbaland]
I dig the vibe that you feeling
Girl and I'm feeling it
Forget tomorrow let's live in night
This could last forever
We can go where ever

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Oh it don't get no better

Super faded off the ground
Ohh but I came to get down

[Pre-Chorus: Timbaland & Mila J]
I dig the vibe that you feeling
Boy and I'm feeling it

[Verse 1: Dat Nigga Lil]
You know ima talk my shit
Cause I can walk my shit
Since my boy died, the 4-5 is what I'm walking with
5 bullets we talking quick
Every track I get on I burn it down I'm an arsonist
And my flow is the awesomest
You can tell if I'm there when them L's in the air
That junk is like a skunk with the tail in the air
That stank, yeah that gank got my eyes to the back
Like six ounces, 4 xans made me nod to my lap
I live inside of the trap
Stuck in a puzzle, no pieces to map
This shit is really way deeper than that
This shit get deeper than rap
Nigga I'm hungry you can hear the way I speak in my track
If I can't school you then I'm leaving you back
Like thick bitches with the weave to the back
I tell you one time only we gon' leave it at that
Because I live in the place of the highest murder rates
And the bitches set a nigga up for a murder date
Sippin' on that sizzurp, talking with a slizzurp
Connected in these streets like a motherfucking kizzurp
You bumping on that izzurp, say that then
B-H we straight one eight, don't play that shit
If your eyes on me, then my eyes on you
Take your eyes off me before my guys on you
If that gun on me, I'll hold one on you
I will cock homie and put some shots on you
I swear to God homie, you need your God with you
Cause if my squad with me, they gon' ride on you
You can't survive homie, he ain't alive he through
Telling y'all, hammer gon' bang you like a nail through the wall
My whole life niggas blood then I fall
I'm not Jada so I don't ask why
I'm on some shit like a fly
I put my spliff to the sky
For all my niggas that died
The way we was living the tradition Ima keep it alive..
(Check.. Check, Listen)

[Verse 2: Meek Millz]
I'm ambitious and hungry
These damn bitches is on me
For grands, we'll hit ya homie
My man'll creep up on em'
With 20 up in his 40
Cancel a nigga for me
My homie is like my army
They grimy, thirsty, and starving
Watching over my target
Waiting up for this dude
The chopper under my armpit
Waiting for him to move
I'm in my groove like Stella when she got it back
It's Meek Milly, Bloodhound nigga holla back
I said Meek Mill terrible, Flow unbearable
Cause I break bricks and throw shells like Mario
Try snitching on me, I'ma bury you
Family or not, like a rock Ima handle you
I'm talking air you out, 4-4 clear it out
For all you lil' ratting motherfuckers better hear me out
I bring them cannons out
Cause I ain't tryna fight, I got a pound that sound like a quarter stick of dynamite
I'm in the kitchen with a pitcher of that china white
Tryna whip it, hit it harder than a Tyson right
Back to the basement with it, niggas basic with it
I fuck hoes, y'all chase them bitches
It's a difference with me, ain't no bitchin with me
Cause I just copped the pound with the laser with it
To erase a nigga, if he jump outta pocket, I grab it, jump out and cock it, and make him come out his pockets
We smoke and drink liquor for all the real niggas that we lost out here, man it's hard out here
I make it and i'll make it till tomorrow out here
Cause time is ticking, and niggas is getting offed out here
Man I'm lost out here, this can't be life
I took the wrong turn left, cause this can't be right
No this can't be like the way I thought it was gonna be
Cause I done see a couple youngins caught it before me
They dying everyday, bullets flying every way
What the fuck is going on, but we can get it on
Cause we ridin' everyday on the top just selling ye
Dishing rocks, ditching cops just to make it through the storm
Until I'm gone, Ima hustle from the muscle, cause I learned only niggas that survive is the strong
Niggas come on, can't complain now it's the life we chose
Only life we know...
You can take a look in my eyes and see inside, its a devil in me
He told me lay a nigga down if he ever tempt me
So if I die it's my time nigga evidently

[Intro:]
Mayne, what da fuck these niggas talkin' 'bout mayne?

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Everybody know my name, "Meek Milly" Flow is flames
Plus I got that fireman, puffas call me Lil Wayne
And I got a little game, hoes feel a nigga's swag
Trying to fuck and suck me just to get they niggas mad
See me I just sit and laugh, you the one that wife that
You eating her and treating her, see I'm the one that pipe that
Soon as I'm finished with her, you can have her right back
If I get a piece of pie, my man got to slice that
Breakdown, takedown, shorty keep your mouth shut
This is what we do, 1-0-2, you ain't about that
I don't give a fuck, I'll leave you stuck like a mouse trap
Middle of the city, tell your brother that get with me
I be stuntin' with the .50, caliber
They holler then I can jump out his Dickies and we be ridin' with them silencers
(pauses)
Ain't nobody seeing me, the whole hood agree with me
I'm wiping niggas out, they like what I'm about
Every time I'm killing it, the whole hood feeling it
I got the word of mouth, right now I'm on the south
Dealing with them killing niggas, sheisty and gorilla niggas
Fuck it though we out, he talking what he about
Nigga making threats, it's a bet
I'll send my Bloodhounds barking at his house
Them summer nights can even turn cold
In the streets of Philly where niggas don't even get to turn old
My heart pump until it turn gold

[Verse 1]
I told her to drive over after dude crib
Bring a couple new friends
Them last girls was too thick
How you expect me to hit?
You wanna watch Clueless
I wanna watch Foolish
Excuse me, miss, I don't appreciate your rudeness
But if you strip, I will appreciate your nudeness
I heard the best head come from girls that is toothless
Yeah my game ruthless, yeah my car roofless
Spit that "Through The Wire" over Chaka Khan, ruthless
She said she had a friend look like Janet Jackson
That bitch came over lookin' more like Freddie Jackson
Nah, nah, nah, baby, won't be no time for no action
I'm just gon' play this "Slow Jamz," holla at your man

[Verse 2]
Old school like Melle Mel
Or we could go to the D where Drelle Drel
Or DC, PG, or ATL
Back in Chi, I mean my life like a magazine
Honey wanna know the details about my ebony
Well that's XXL
Father penthouse, yeah that's upscale
Mademoiselle got a hell of a black tail
I'm feelin' the vibe, her body and soul
I heard you stay in a metropolitan home
Well let's kill all the pollyin', I offer you a Cosmopolitan
Let's jet out the club, get some oxygen
Your friends say I'm a player, you'd be lucky to keep me
You know people gon' be talkin' 'bout us weekly
My car be in a robbery
P-O-R-T but what's more important to me is that
Don't be comin' 'round my girl tryna act like Mr. Friendly
And steal the spotlight like Mr. Bentley
I spotted her like Spud McKenzie
And for them fake boobies, I paid them Benjis
Get your own
I got Paris, he got Nicky, he tried to get him a clone
He said, "Ye, you know you got extra hoes
And everything you do is extra cold"
From the Polo fleece to the Jesus piece
I got family in high places like Jesus niece
Can I please say my peace?
If y'all fresh to death then I'm deceased
And this one here is a heat rock, spit like a beatbox
The way the beat rocks, new version of Pete Rock
But for that Benz I get CL love
So I switched my girls around like 3L dub
My favorite girl wanna leave me just because I got a girlfriend
My freak girl told me now she's a Christian
My white girl wanna move back to Michigan
I'm pullin' girls off the bench like a 6th man
I'm in the club pullin' the same old two step
While Omegas doin' the same old Q step
I had my money on my mind, I was thinkin' green
She a pledge, AKA, she was pink and green
I want a good girl, she want a gentleman
We sayin' the same thing like a synonym
I wasn't really spittin' game, I was scrimmagin'
My penmanship is so hard it needs censorship
I'm a Chicagoan 'til Chicago wins
'Til we blow like Chicago wind
I don't know what's better, gettin' laid or gettin' paid
I just know when I'm gettin' one the other's gettin' away
I have to say, we goin' to mass today
We have to pray, these niggas is wack and aye I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most these niggas don't even deserve a track from me
First of all, let's get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots
And get your tall ass out that C-Class coupe
You see the whiskey, had them girls feelin' frisky
You was with me, she said, "Who's your sensei?"
And even if they wanna get busy
And freaky like Missy and roll some weed up
You'll roll 3 blunts and fuck up 3 blunts
Mothafucka you would fuck up a free lunch
Dawg, keep it right thurr like Chingy
Your girl don't like me? How long has she been gay?
Spanish girls ask me, "No habla ingles"
And everybody wanna run to me for their sin-glay
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg if I was you I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg if I was you I'd kill myself
That Ethiopian chick drinkin' straight up liquor
I told her I'm Nigerian, that's straight up nigga
She claimed she ain't hear me on "The Bounce" with Jigga
She claimed she ain't see me on the basement with Tigga
Them both my niggas, I suppose
I might have been doin' a lil' frontin' for the hoes
When I flip flows, I rip shows
And your girlfriends, can I hit those?
I don't know if it's me, or do them Uggs
Got girl's feets lookin' like sheepskin rugs
Some rhyme with her name, some rhyme nameless
Don't try to treat me like I ain't famous
My apologies, are you into astrology?
Cause umm... I'm tryna make it to your anus
See that's a little Don Juan game
All across your chest like Sean John's name
Niggas tryna figure out since Kan' came
Who the rookie of the year: me or LeBron James?
They said, "Woah don't get caught up in the hype"
Ain't no tellin' they gon' love you after tonight
Well if tonight's the night, pop bottles, fuck models
Spend moeny 'til you're broke, my nigga, live your life
Cause I'm livin' international, nigga, the American dream
All my dawgs is livin' vicariously through me
If I get head from Drene, that's one for the team
Cause 702, that's one for the crew
My dawg Hip-Hop really love Claudette
So if I ever get to smash, this fuck's for you
I can barely drive the G5 down King Drive
Cause like a Brinks truck, they know there's money inside

[Intermission]
I'ma take a little intermission
I'ma let y'all just talk about how good I rap for a minute and I'ma come back

[Verse 3]
So I dropped out of school cause I'm tryna eff the tutor
Her ex man drove a Mercury Cougar
I hit her with this maneuver, he just couldn't recuper'
I'm tryna stab one like Jack The Ripper
I'm tryna stab two like Jack The Tripper
My nigga Tone been locked for a minute
He come home, he from the skreets, he gon' want him some skrippers
And I'm a big tipper, I don't even be trippin'
This my first real Rolex, it don't even be tickin'
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without 'em cloudin' up in a half an hour
So that basically mean my paper gettin' jean
4 Gs in the Rocawear jeans
This top red hot like Anthony Kiedis
You see this? These are the sweetest Adidas
We fire, y'all retire
All ugly people, please be quiet
Hov ain't get a beat from me in a minute
He heard "Just to Get By" and I was re-hired
I got a track right now that could save Mya
Laughs I do though...

[Intro]
Hey, no

Yeah, I'm bringin' it on, toast and a cheer 'cause I'm bringin' it on

Bring that shit to me, fuck the price it's nothin'
And I don't need help I can

Pussy ass nigga, we don't fuck with that shit (Nah)

Moonrock weed got us taking Cali trips (Take off)
Pull up, foreign cars and we hit the damn strip (Skrrt)
Government jewels and they causin' eclipse (Shinin')

But only thing we be loading is a clip (Load)
Ain't never lackin' 'cause Quad ain't gon' slip (Fah, fah)
Made for this life, every well equipped (Gone)

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
It's KK what I'm smoking nigga

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
And I done popped so many bottles think I'm through with it
Been smoking so much weed in public owners cool with it
Been on my grind since I was young and now I'm stupid rich
You niggas stupid, I'm in the club and it's ruthless
My crew ain't part of that bullshit
My new whips the hardest
Walk in the office like a business man
I'm just an artist
Smoking and all, crib full of weed
Plaques on the wall
My face on all the magazines
Kush in this jar I'm getting this cheese
Pants skinny rubber bands plenty
Whole team going hard like it's the last inning
Whole team going hard you got no chance of winning
Lot of seats on the floor lot of cash pending
I play the game left hand like my man Jimi
You just a right hand man call that man Semmi

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
What can I say?
What can I do?
To show how much
Real shit a nigga do
What can I say?
What can I do?
To show how much
Real shit a nigga do

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
All of this off the internet
Those who ain't seen it coming dog I been a threat
Been smoking up all this weed
Been rolling up while I drive
Been to the bottom and back
Been seen you haters disguised
Niggas telling me lies
Just to try to get close
Shades cover my eyes cause I be higher than most
Been on the plane for twenty hours, and wasn’t tired
Live by the code, money power
Once I got on, my niggas hired
Juicy J he ride, it’s the gang or die
The game will stress you out but that’s what this dubie is for
You acting like you know me now
Never knew me before
Snoop sat me down, school me even more
Kick it with my son and don’t even do the awards
Said next year I might win me one
You got problems don't lend me none
Got a pound then go send me one

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
What can I say?
What can I do?
To show how much
Real shit a nigga do
What can I say?
What can I do?
To show how much
Real shit a nigga do

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Niggas out here broke because they scared of that bread
My money so old I got mold on that bread
How you think I went and copped that Rolls-Royce Corniche?
Turn around and bought a Maybach next week
A nigga don't hustle then a nigga don't eat
A nigga ain't paying fair, and life ain't cheap
Nigga ain’t shit sweet but this box of swisher sweets
Ever since I was a youngin I was
Getting it in the streets
Now I'm on tour even getting it overseas
All the way in Switzerland stacking swisser-cheese
I ain't too good for that brown paper bag
I can still move that work and I get it off fast, hoe

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
What can I say?
What can I do?
To show how much
Real shit a nigga do
What can I say?
What can I do?
To show how much
Real shit a nigga do
Oh

[Chorus]
Scared money don’t make money, so what you scared for?
And real people do real things, so what you here for?
A stand up nigga stand up for the rest of their life (Yeah)
And real G’s do what they want, don’t ever think twice

[Verse 1]
Uh, it go, one for the money
Two for the niggas gettin’ it
Three for the niggas that be running from it
You gotta grind if you really want it
Don’t hesitate
You came this far now finish out the whole dream
Nobody said it would be easy though, just stick to your plan
They don’t understand
Going up against the odds
Having no regards
Make our own laws, you could be your own boss
But they don’t tell you that
All you need is a foundation to stand on
And you can build it then the limit is the sky
Until then I’m with my niggas gettin' high
And plus we with it you all know the business

[Chorus]
Scared money don’t make money, so what you scared for?
And real people do real things, so what you here for?
A stand up nigga stand up the rest of their lives
And real G’s do what they want, don’t ever think twice

[Verse 2]
Oh what did you think I would never get another M?
Niggas only in the game cause we let ‘em in
We ain’t check they chains
We ain’t put ‘em on blast and expose them fools for everything
We ain’t tell you how they really lames
And that they don’t do shit that they get on TV and say
We ain’t mad though, we on the coast of France for three days
I’m tryna make a play, marijuana steam sauna
Young nigga from the bottom cracking lobster, eating pasta
You would think that he a mobster
La Familia, no you not familiar
Just got a bigger safe, now it’s time to fill it up, nigga

[Chorus]
Scared money don’t make money, so what you scared for?
And real people do real things, so what you waiting for?
A stand up nigga stand up the rest of their lives (Stand your ass up)
And real G’s do what they want, don’t ever think twice (Do something about it)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I feel special, I feel special
Look at my wrist, fingers, ears, look at my neck glow

Check out my bitch, check out my peers, keep 'em extra
Keep 'em fresh, my diamonds a massive mess
She said she not going for that

She'll erase you with a pistol
My diamonds they got way bigger
I bought me a tiger, Tigger

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
My diamonds they shine of course
Fuck her with a charlie horse
Pull up, let Lil' Dolly bust
Four fives in them Calicos
My cars sound like Need for Speed
My feet on some Mickey D's
He clutching, he acting crazy
She want Lil' Lucci to leave
I told her he can not go
He got to stay with me with .44's
My Forgis sittin' tall like a rollercoast
These fuck niggas slower than rollie-pollies
DJ Sky flying higher
YSL never tell no choir
She want to fuck on my meal like Myers
I'm ninja lil' nigga
Tell 'em or tell something

Laced up with some L's on us
Motherfucker go crazy draw down with the steel on him
And I really, really, really can't tell prepare for jail on 'em

[Chorus: Young Thug]

Look at my wrist, fingers, ears, look at my neck glow

One of her bags half a bird
Pull out that Audemar, my diamonds water water you would think that I could surf

And I serve a nigga like Lurch, swerve

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I feel special, I feel special
Look at my wrist, fingers, ears, look at my neck glow

[Verse 3: Offset]
Offset!
I got a K and it's special just like its a cereal
I'm looking down on your peasants because I'm the king and I'm the superior
You know I got shooters on top of the roof and you think that I'm playing I'm serious
I'm on them Percocets and Vicodins
I'm adding the money not minusing
I got a bad bitch look like Kylie Jenner
It's a millionaire club and you not a member
We slaying your hoe put that dick up in her
Don't try me lil' nigga, I recommend it
Fifty thousand for the Audemar Piguet
You think about robbing nigga? Better abort the mission like you killing children
Cause I got that semi Grinch, stole Christmas, send shooter through your chimney
She fucked the star and tried to keep the condom
I fucked that hoe after hours like a Roma
Coca Cola coming from Tijuana
My wrists is sick, sometimes I want to vomit
Got that pump in my truck, I'm not talking about Donald
I want an island bitch, come here Rihanna
I got out of jail screaming, "Fuck the 'your honor'!"

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I feel special, I feel special
Look at my wrist, fingers, ears, look at my neck glow
I feel special, I feel special
Check out my bitch, check out my peers, keep 'em extra

She'll erase you with a pistol
My diamonds they got way bigger

[Intro]
Mhmm
That's just how it is man
Round my way

[Verse 1]
Just a young lil' nigga, but he had the right plan
Twenty-thousand in his left, pistol in his right hand
Counting every dollar that he get, cause he worked for it
But don't run up on him cause you'll probably get murked for it
Mom's out working, Daddy wasn't home
Ain't nobody give it to him, so he got it on his own
Yeah, he got it on his own
You want something? Gotta take it
Tryna get up out the hood, but he’ll probably never make it
He’s a midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga
Came from a city where them niggas they some killas

[Hook]
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas

[Verse 2]
Just a young nigga, but he had the right plan
Slanging looking for them people hopping out them white vans
Standing on the corner rolling up their marijuana
Smoking weed and selling packs of D till you’re a gonner
Caught a case and lost some racks, the nigga got it back
In any case a nigga disrespect, he’s on his back
He bought a pack, then bought a strap
This niggas got his back
His life has changed it’s gone to smack
And ain’t no turning back

[Hook]
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas

[Verse 3]
Just a young nigga, but he had the right plan
Wore a lot of jewelry, he slept with it on his nightstand
Made a lot of money and he got it all from hustling
Came from a good family but say he can’t get enough of it
All up in the club and he ain’t looking for a ring
Fucking other niggas bitches, yeah he swear that was his thing
Yeah, he learned a little lesson ‘bout messing with them haters
Cause they found his body later
Guess that’s what he get for fucking with them...

[Hook]
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas
Midwest cowboy, Pittsburgh nigga
Came from a city where the niggas they some killas

[Verse 1]
It don't wait for me to cast away
The feelings of poor taste
Knowing that, I'm channeling my few and hasty lovers
Loving in me grows older
Through its style and grace
Never floated off to find some real escape

[Chorus]
Today, saying it right away
Going for the eternal flame
I'ma do whatever it takes
Oh today, saying it right away
Going for the eternal flame
I'ma do whatever it takes
Takes...
Takes...
Takes...
Takes...

I'ma do whatever it takes, yeah
Said that I'm gonna
No...

[Verse 2]
When I woke up this day
There was no one around
Telling me what I say
The energy is profound
And I woke up that day
Put my feet on the ground
Telling me what I say
The energy is profound

[Chorus]
Today, saying it right away
Going for the eternal flame
I'ma do whatever it takes, o-oh...
Today, saying it right away
Going for the eternal flame
I'ma do whatever it takes
Takes...
Takes...
Takes...

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I know that I’m making a killing
My coupe got them stars in the ceiling
My niggas go brazy, no Ritalin
AB bitch, I’m all bout them Benji’s
I come through there fresh like John Lennon
My wrist a Hellcat, I’m not kidding
They dig all the shit that I’m kicking
I just bought my bitch some new titties
You take out these pictures, you bogus
Wasn't gon’ turn your ass until you told it'
Wasn't gon’ ice your ass down ‘til you folded
Kick that bitch off the boat with no notice
Nigga jewelry water, need to float it
Make some bad bitches fuck my brodie
I eat crabs, fish, and that Chipotle
They got lots of bread, I’ma call Butta

[Verse 1: Young Butta]
Three chopsticks, I paid a stack for it
They run me through, I probably got warrants
In the back of the 'Bach, ugh
Burning OG out of Backwoods
Not just dancing, diamonds racing Balmain
Lots of fakes allergic to seafood and serve for decoration
Lobster never tasted
Missed Thanksgiving, I was in Miami
I was on ocean, I was on vacation
In the Benz speed, 120 racing
AB in a Rari, shit was like the Matrix
In and out of lanes, weaving in the spaceship
I’m flexing, got muscle like Popeye
But fight over a bitch, no that is not I
I’m him, I'm gon' tell the roof bye bye
Then remove the lid at the stoplight
With my side bitches at Benihana’s
Brung her sister, her bestie, her mama
Told ‘em tab is on me, yeah I got ‘em
And I pay the bill all in new hundreds
Now that is real colorful money
Spikes on me, they drip at the bottom
She want Thug, and her friend is a toss up

[Hook: Young Thug]
I know that I’m making a killing
My coupe got them stars in the ceiling
My niggas go brazy, no Ritalin
AP bitch, I’m all bout them Benji’s

They dig all the shit that I’m kicking

We gon’ ice your ass down ‘til you folded
Kick that bitch off the boat with no notice
Nigga jewelry water, need to float it
Make some bad bitches fuck my brody
I eat crabs, fish, and that Chipotle
They got lots of bread, I’ma call Butta

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
She say she want a cat
So I went bought the Jag
And it matches the bag
Make these bitches look sad
I just dyed my hair grey
Like a motherfucking dad
And you know that we feastin’
I just couldn’t get fat
Mind fuck ‘em when I speak
Take the Farrakhan notes
My rock wrist is on gold
Like the new Audi spokes
Niggas scared to they soul
When I pull up with folks
I’ma take out the Trojans put it right in her throat
And you know I stay with them AKs and I should’ve caught ‘em
Mind fuck 'em, he shouldn't have played 'bout the butta
I only play inside the cover
Like a kid, make them play with each other
And I'm ridin' round with a real bad bitch
Oops I meant girl, cover

[Hook: Young Thug]
I know that I’m making a killing
My coupe got them stars in the ceiling

[Verse 1: Ralo]
Had a talk with Thug, we was talkin' 'bout Escobar (Pablo!)
Snitches the only thing a rich nigga stressin' for
Remember we was riding on the MARTA bus
They'd rob the bank before they think 'bout robbing us
We did this shit ourself, we ain't ask for no help
He'll kill for Terrell, I'll kill for lil' Jeff
So now we got right, these niggas went left
Ridin' 'round with them straps, I ain't talkin' seat belts
I swear to God I'll murk 'em if Thugger say the word
We went from robbing these niggas to selling bricks and birds
They had the nerve to say they don't like me riding with Thug
But at first, they liked to see a friend in clubs

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Hey, them my niggas
Yeah, them my boys
Light him up like he Christmas
If he play with my boys
Yeah, them my dogs, them my boys
Yeah, them my niggas, them my boys
We gon' ball if she get my boys
Yeah, fuck that bitch if you my boy
Yeah, if you my boys

[Verse 4: Young Thug]

[Verse 1]
Got a penny in my pocket
And a dollar in my hand
But I'll drop it in your tin cup
Cause you were a one man band
If I could make a million
On some TV show
On the roulette wheel
In a great big casino

[Chorus]
I'd go ahead and do it
But only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it
In the name of you
Whatever worth I'd choose
Whatever tricks I'd use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you

I got my favorite hat
With that snakeskin band
When you need a little shake
I've put it in your hands
To the bottom of the ocean
I would surely dive
To find the oldest oyster
With the biggest pearl inside

[Chorus]
I'd go ahead and do it
But only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it
In the name of you
Whatever worth I'd choose
Whatever tricks I'd use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you

[Bridge]
I'd claim a country
I'd claim a tune
All the undiscovered territory
Out there beyond the moon

[Chorus]
I'd go ahead and do it
But only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it
In the name of you
Whatever worth I'd choose
Whatever tricks I'd use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you
I'd go ahead and do it
But only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it
In the name of you
Whatever worth I'd choose
Whatever tricks I'd use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you
In the name of you
In the name of you

In the name of you
In the name of you
In the name of you
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
You're holding back
You're hard to read
Your a 21st century kind
You're lighting fast
Built for speed
A tight lipped modern mind
An architect
Of grand romance
You're a mystery of disguise
You're holed up in your house
Just waiting for the fire
You're buttoned down
All sown up
You're an ontological soul
Cold hard truth
Only proof
What we already know

[Chorus]
You're gonna need a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
To bust on through
And break down your walls
Loosen your lips
Slacken that jaw
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord

[Verse 2]
Look at us fools
Being used
We're totally dumb, surprised
Waiting for you to share with us
The myth behind the lies
Come on out
Throw us a bone
We want to know your intentions
Are you fake
For goodness sake
Or the Mother of Invention
You're buttoned down
All sown up
You're an ontological soul
Cold hard truth
Only proof
What we already know

[Chorus]
You're gonna need a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
To bust on through
And break down your walls
Loosen your lips
Slacken that jaw
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
You're gonna need a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
To bust on through
And break down your walls
Loosen your lips
Slacken that jaw
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord

[Verse 1]
I am the elder Utah Smith
I've got two wings to fly
They may be made of paper
They may never reach the sky
But I believe in mercy
I believe that man is good
And if they want two wings like me
There's a chance they could

[Verse 2]
I am the elder Utah Smith
I was born in Cedar Grove
That's in Louisiana
On a dirt-poor stretch of road
I found the calling early
Gave birth to righteous words
And in a tent around the South
I took my sonic church

[Chorus]
I was a light for the living
And I spoke of peace and love
With two wings and my old Gibson
I bought blessings from above
I was here and I was gone
Just a heartbeat from the past
But I went from paper wings
To the real thing at last

[Verse 3]
I am the elder Utah Smith
I take all as they are
I was the first man of the cloth
To blacken a guitar
Love was my redeemer
I felt it from the start
The Holy Ghost was channeled
Through the sound of my guitar

[Chorus]
I was a light for the living
And I spoke of peace and love
With two wings and my old Gibson
I bought blessings from above
I was here and I was gone
Just a heartbeat from the past
But I went from paper wings
To the real thing at last

[Verse 4]
Been a long time in the ground
Unmarked is my grave
But I reside elsewhere these days
Thanks to souls I've saved
I traveled far, I traveled wide
Three quarts for the Lord
Till one day he called me home
To claim his great reward

[Chorus]
I was a light for the living
And I spoke of peace and love
With two wings and my old GIbson
I bought blessings from above
I was here and I was gone
Just a heartbeat from the past
But I went from paper wings
To the real thing at last

I was a light for the living
And I spoke of peace and love
With two wings and my old GIbson
I bought blessings from above
I was here and I was gone
Just a heartbeat from the past
But I went from paper wings
To the real thing at last

[Verse 1]
Don't shy away from coming in
Closer still my darling friend
Don't slip, don't trip on life
I bear the moon
Inside your eyes
Don't be afraid of all my years
What you see or what you hear
It's all yours and yours and yours alone
Yours for the taking, so take it home

[Chorus]
Oh it's a good heart
To be a part of
Just a soul full all men tend to love
The kind of love you never knew
Oh it's a good heart from me to you

[Verse 2]
Oh sure it's cracked a time or two
But him and me, we pulled on through
I've seen 'em come, I've seen 'em go
Some went through fast
Some went real slow
So take a chance, and take your time
Reading my face between the lines
I love real good, and I love you
My heart and me
That's what we do

[Chorus]
Oh it's a good heart
To be a part of
Just a soul full all men tend to love
The kind of love you never knew
Oh it's a good heart from me to you

Oh it's a good heart
To be a part of
Just a soul full all men tend to love
The kind of love you never knew
Oh it's a good heart from me to you

[Verse 1]
Hand it over
Reach across the line
Let's talk about it, tell me one more time
What is it you want
What you think you'll find
Inside of this old heart of mine
Come on out
Cause you want to play
The rain went east, come to roll away
Here you went to choose and you're gonna stay
So I knew that's the price I pay

[Chorus]
Can't you tell the deal's been done
Won't you let me love you
I don't see no smoking gun
I'm not up here to judge you
What do you see when you look at me
Tell the man to measure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure

[Verse 2]
I roamed around
Looking for a clue
Searched the world it's what I used to do
Where I went
What I went though
A bit too hard to find a way to you
I can't move so
Never really could
Sing a song that you understood
It's what you do when you think you should
Surrender like you knew you always would

[Chorus]
Can't you tell the deal's been done
Won't you let me love you
I don't see no smoking gun
I'm not up here to judge you
What do you see when you look at me
Tell the man to measure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure

[Bridge]
Hold out, distilling down
What's it going to be
Never tell
In a million years
No, you can't get enough of me

[Chorus]
Can't you tell the deal's been done
Won't you let me love you
I don't see no smoking gun
I'm not up here to judge you
What do you see when you look at me
Tell the man to measure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure
It feels like I'm flying
When I see your face
I'm charged with a power
Of amazing grace
I flip the switch signal
On the permanent dream
Like the palm of my hand
On a tambourine

Dumb rocks filling up
My poor head
Did you just say
What I thought you said
First cat back here gets the cream
And bounce a little river
Of my tambourine

[Chorus]
Smack in the middle
Toss it in the air
I don't care
You can play me everywhere
Roll and rattle
When I'm out of steam
You got my head ringing like a tambourine

[Verse 3]
A curveball coming
That I didn't see
A flash flood washing
Out a dried up creek
A went in muddy
But I came out clean
Like a Baptist banging
On a tambourine

[Chorus]
Smack in the middle
Toss it in the air
I don't care
You can play me everywhere
Roll and rattle
When I'm out of steam
You got my head ringing like a tambourine

[Bridge]
You're a spinning-round gypsy in the moonlight
Cymbals flashing in the firelight
I'm freefalling into a dream
My hidden heart banging
Like the tambourine

[Chorus]
Smack in the middle
Toss it in the air
I don't care
You can play me everywhere
Roll and rattle
When I'm out of steam
You got my head ringing like a tambourine
Roll and rattle
When I'm out of steam
You got my head ringing like a tambourine

[Verse 1]
You gotta think about it
You gotta make a wish and count to ten
There's just a sense of wonder
I feel a new direction looking down the lens
Jump started the action
Heard a song in my head and wrote it down
It came out of nowhere
Felt a new sensation driving you through town

[Chorus]
You're an open chord I wanna play all day
A new broom sweeping up the sins I no longer play
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day

[Verse 2]
You're gonna see some changes
Gotta pinch myself just to believe
Everybody's having something
But I can tell you've got some magic up your sleeve
Some deep protection
When a feeling follows you around
I always need the silence
Or the lightning you bring like a new good sound

[Chorus]
You're an open chord I wanna play all day
A new broom sweeping up the sins I no longer play
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day

[Verse 3]
Sat around and waited for a spark
And it brightened up the night
Before I get much older
I want the pleasure of seeing you up in lights
I could then beside you
Hand over my heart and say a prayer
Love's not for quitters
It's a satisfaction
Knowing that you're there

[Chorus]
You're an open chord I wanna play all day
A new broom sweeping up the sins I no longer play
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day

[Verse 1]
I've got a strong-willed someone to love me
Here off a highway in the way
Don't need to shout it
We're living here quietly
Away from the folks
Who just sleep all day
I lived the fast life, taking some chances
On my high horse everyone rode
All around were too many monkeys
Asleep at the wheel
And running the show

[Chorus]
But I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
Rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight

[Verse 2]
All my sweet sins  stayed in the city
I caved in and wandered into your heart
When least expected out of the heavens
The moonlight descended into the dark

[Chorus]
But I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
Rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight

[Bridge]
Was your 

[?] to watch
In no heaven
Set back the clock you gave me
Your time
I'm living better now I'm free and easy
Freedom past I've left here high

[Chorus]
Well I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
Rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight
(Because I'm)
I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
Rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight
Where you are tonight

[Verse 1]
Had some good times
Jumping ship
And showing up on shore
Just pocket change to get us by
A little bit of grease to help us slide
Give us a nickel and take your mark
To squeeze under the door

[Verse 2]
Caught some big ones
Reeled em in
And hung em out to dry
From little fish to bigger things
A welcome push
An empty swing
Given the chance we'd stop to sing
And watch the world go by

[Chorus]
And I tried to take my time
To get back up, hold on and climb
Into the arms, you'll always find me
In England and America
(England and America)
It seems good to hold, to not let go
The safety net still hangs real low
And if I fall it's good to know
There's England and America

[Verse 3]
Showed our roots from time to time
And used it to ignite
Our wilder side to get up through
To push and pull, and come unglued
Mixture of red wine and blues
That run right through our lives

[Chorus]
And I tried to take my time
To get back up, hold on and climb
Into the arms, you'll always find me
In England and America
(England and America)
It seems good to hold, to not let go
The safety net still hangs real low
And if I fall it's good to know
There's England and America

And I tried to take my time
To get back up, hold on and climb
Into the arms, you'll always find me
In England and America
(England and America)
It seems good to hold, to not let go
The safety net still hangs real low
And if I fall it's good to know
There's England and America
England and America
England and America

[Verse 1]
Ice cubes on the back of your neck
Warm wind blowing through the parking lot
A radio humming in every car
And it feel like the clocks have stopped
Calypso moon just cast its spell
We grabbed that magic just because
We remember and never forget
What a wonderful crazy night that was

[Chorus]
Some things you don't forget
Some things just take a hold
A wonderful crazy night like that
Takes you back won't let you go
Some day if you ask him all about the key to love
I'll say that wonderful night
What a wonderful crazy night it was

[Verse 2]
Loose clothes and a cool, cool drink
A greasy breeze from the chicken stand
Heart's on fire just one last time
A wishbone snapping in every hand

[Chorus]
Some things you don't forget
Some things just take a hold
A wonderful crazy night like that
Takes you back won't let you go
Some day if you ask him all about the key to love
I'd say that wonderful night
What a wonderful crazy night it was

[Bridge]
We found the place to feel it
We knew where we were at
Started the path, felt out our future
Don't everybody need a night like that

[Verse 3]
Ice cubes on the back of your neck
Warm wind blowing through the parking lot
We remember and never forget
What a wonderful crazy night that was

[Chorus]
Some things you don't forget
Some things just take a hold
A wonderful crazy night like that
Takes you back won't let you go
Some day if you ask him all about the key to love
I'd say that wonderful night
What a wonderful crazy night it was

[Intro]
Man a nigga just really want money, man. You know what I'm sayin'? A nigga don't really give a shit about too much.

That's just to be completely honest, I don't give a fuck about what none of ya'll hoes talkin' about. If ya'll niggas ain't talkin' about money don't talk to me

[Verse]
Ain't nobody flyer, young nigga, nobody higher
When I pull out this nine watch how fast his realness expire
I never trust a nigga, never will I trust a ho
Bitter sweet young nigga with some nice clothes
I ball like Sean Kemp, poppin' bottles in the Vip
I feel like a pimp at Long Johns eatin' my shrimp
Surrounded by bad bitches, I thank god for all my bitches
Without all my bitches I would probably still have bitches
In that droptop Volvo all my migos call me Marco
Real nigga rule number one, never give out your info
Pocket full of pintos, different color like some Mentos
X be smokin' cigs, I guess he do it for the Menthol
I miss my brother Jimmy, biggest influence to me
STYCXS and young nigga I got all access
I see why these niggas mad cause I got all the hoes
I see why these niggas mad cause I got all the hoes

[Verse]
I left home at 17
Had to get on my own
I was young
But I was keen to survive on the road
In the fall
Got to gig, with my brother in large
Choppin' work
Bagging groceries, pushing in carts
I was grateful to be working
But say, my back is hurting
I don't think it's the purpose
No this can't be the call
At night, I'm on good times
Just passing the time
On my break
I wrote a song about the love of my life
This ain't right
Couple dollars in change
Walkin' home in the rain
Jump in front of a train
Bitch, I might
On top of the roof
Empty bottles of Brew
Take a hit on my J
I'm in flight
Closin my eyes visualizin'
Monte Carlo's with tinted windows
And Ballin' legitimate
Open my eyes, I was in the same predicament
The Next week I called in and said I quit
Bitch, I get bigger

[Verse 1]
Ahh, Yeah
You fix your makeup just so
Guess you don't know that you're beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago
And if your mirror won't make it any clearer
I'll be the one to let you know

[Chorus]
Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
You make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you

[Verse 2]
You stop the room when we walk in
The spotlight's on , everybody's staring
Tell all of these boys they're wasting their times
Stop standing in line cause you're all mine
And this evening, I won't let this feeling die
I never want to leave your side

[Chorus]
Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
You make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world

[Bridge]
You keep wondering if you're what I wanted
You don't even have to try
Ahh, you don't have to try
Don't try, don't try
You don't have to try

[Chorus]
Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
They don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
You and I
Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I

See I'm a lean drinker
I'm a mean drinker
I don't ever drink no cause I'm a clean drinker
I spill some lean on my hand, I got sticky fingers
I got some sweet 

[?] in L.A like I'm a gang banger
I raid your refrigerator clean, fill everything up with lean
And my black cup filled with lean
Chevy drop top, paint it lean
Niggas so slick, they'll cut you lean
Mix that Qualitest with clean
Drop in a lake full of lean

[?] dream, huh

[Hook]
Rainbow colors in my cup, in my cup (In it)
Rainbow colors in my cup, in my cup (Leanin')
Rainbow colors in my cup, in my cup
Jolly Ranchers mane, that shit be good as fuck
That's that syrup motherfucker that's that syrup, I'm getting throwed (That's that syrup, syrup)
That's that syrup motherfucker that's that syrup, I'm getting throwed
That's that syrup motherfucker that's that syrup, I'm getting throwed (Bricksquad, big money talk)
That's that syrup motherfucker that's that syrup, I'm getting throwed (Talk to em dog)

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Got residue on my shirt and my cup dirty
Moving slow, I'm on the E-Way doing about 30
This make a (This a, this a trappy business)
I been drinking and driving, ain't no way I can't have it
It got me swerving all over the road
I'm so high, I wanna walk but my eyes closed
In my own school with my yellow bruh
Smoking purple, pouring up purple, sipping yellow dog

[Hook]
That's that syrup motherfucker that's that syrup, I'm getting throwed
That's that syrup motherfucker that's that syrup, I'm getting throwed (Leanin')
That's that syrup motherfucker that's that syrup, I'm getting throwed
That's that syrup motherfucker that's that syrup, I'm getting throwed

[Outro]
That's that syrup, syrup
Bricksquad, big money talk

[Verse 1]
Fatal, this attraction
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

[Chorus]
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

[Verse 2]
My heart wide open
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

[Chorus]
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

[Bridge]
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?

[Breakdown]
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

Patch on my eye like Spuds McKenzie
Strike up on the wall where your homies and friends be
Long Beach nigga we the all Crip ci-ty

Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: Candice Pillay]
Go 'head baby
Dem Jointz, you're killing 'em baby
Uh, go 'head baby
Pharmacy you're killing it baby
Uh, go 'head baby
Stand up if you're feeling it baby
Uh, go 'head baby
Dem Jointz, you're killing it baby

[Chorus: Dem Jointz]
All the sounds in my head
It's music to my ears
Gunshots are ringing
The melody brings me to tears
And the helicopters in the air and it's scaring all the kids
This is music to drive by, you know what it is

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
They say the shit that I say is a misdemeanor
And some of the shit I say, I can say it cleaner
But everything you say results in no believers
So your opinion can kiss the tip of my fucking penis
It's so vulgar, so inappropriate
Business man from the hood, billionaires is his associates
Don't get it twisted, got killers just a mile from here
(You know you done fucked up, don't you?)

[Chorus: Dem Jointz]
All the sounds in my head
It's music to my ears
Gunshots are ringing
The melody brings me to tears
And the helicopters in the air and it's scaring all the kids
This is music to drive by, you know what it is

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Yo…

[Verse 1: Elbee Thrie]
It's been a while since the last time
You left my
I think about you sometimes

[Chorus: Elbee Thrie]
I think about you sometimes
I think about you sometimes

[Verse 2: Elbee Thrie]
It's been a while since the last time
We just
I think about you sometimes

[Chorus: Elbee Thrie]
I think about you sometimes
I think about you sometimes

[Verse 3: Elbee Thrie]
It's been awhile since the last time
That I spoke your name (Your name)
I think about you sometimes

[Chorus: Elbee Thrie]
I think about you sometimes
I think about you sometimes

[Chorus]
Duty is called, I'm leaving you once more
I will be back, right back when I'm off from the tour
The tour is your
Duty is called for the raw and the raw one is me
It's me you see
All of them told me "Kris you're to old b"
When they step to the mic
None of them could hold me

[Verse 1]
Rhymes never running out, you know what KRS about
I'm all up in the game like Jordan when his tounge is out
The streets is mine these youngins busting is buggin out
You don't see no stars when the sun is out I'm coming out
Who you think the sun round here?
All that soft thug pop shit know but don't get done round here
I'm only making my uniqueness kris-style clear
So your head, I don't have to put a missile there
I do preach peace tho, I am hip hop
But when the Glock pops your brain goes into a dropbox
I keep the crowd jumping like hopscotch in the party
I'm the dopest emcee and im dressed like anybody
I show up, wanna fight, unshaven naughty
Battle a platinum rapper and take his Bugatti
Sell it in the hood, provide for everybody
Next week another rapper giving up a Ferrari

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
What they call dope today is wack, I'm sorry
I'm raw, sushi style I spit the wasabi
I'm at the corner store, gas station shopping
Go "where these other rappers really be at I don't know"
But everywhere our crews at people want the boom bap
Boom bap and we ain't taking nothing from no new cats
But KRS-One I come from where your shoes at
Where your soul at, this that real street new jack
Who's that, the masta with the blasta
I dont write song for cash, I write songs that last
They call me the teache cuz I'm from a different class
I preserve hip hop
These the the two kings, these are the greatest
These youngers claiming king and ain't even made this
When the true king touchdown you know it
No talk, no hype, just skills and we show it

[Chorus]

[Chorus x4]
We know, yeah it's all in they flow
Yeah it's all in they show
They some bite, bite, bite, bite, biterz

[Verse 1]
Everybody know KRS-One, he is a writer
Original lyrics and routines
No biting, no biter
Prime reciter
I gets the news because I'm tighter, graffiti writer
But now I'm talking about these biterz
What's a biter?
A biter's unoriginal, a biter's predictable
Skills minimal, yo these dudes are pitiful
They conserts are wack, I don't even try to go to them
They open they mouth and I hear the radio all over them
Remember in them early days when we was coming up
You had to be original, yep with dope lyric and your cut
Every day and every night you had to practice and come up
With the dopest rhymes that'll make a crowd of people say buck-buck
Everybody had they own style, ran they own lane
Everyboday had a profile, ran they own game
Every DJ had his own style, broke his own name
Now it's lame, everything rap was against it became

[Chorus x4]

[Verse 2]
Listen to they lyrics and they style, you know they biterz
They listening to the radio, then they claim they write it
But it does get deeper, all the wheeling and dealing
When the society we live in, is all about stealing
And these ignorant rapper they bring creativity down
Now one is using they mind, they just scrounging around
So a biter is a unorigianl style stealer
They see you drink tequila, so they wanna drink tequila
You say mommy or poppy, they say mommy or poppy
They really have no original ideas, they just copy
And people walking around, hollow like that
If death was the new sting, they would follow the path
They not led by the inner, they led by the outer
So they led every hour by anybody with power
Be original, be authentic, be you
But every emcee test the mic with a "one, two"

[Chorus x4]

[Verse 1]
He went to them, they turned away
He just wanted something to eat, a place to love, a place to pray
In God we trust, and it's okay
He said, "I'm black, latin, and gay...
I went to them, they turned away."

[Pre-Chorus]
Where life is holding you down
And you're having trouble finding peace
You gotta be brave
Be brave, until you're bleeding
Where life is holding you hard in a place that it don't want to be
You gotta posh life
'Cause life is all you need

[Chorus]
We live a posh life
And the world says we're not brave until we bleed
You gotta trust in the future of us
Believe posh life
We live a posh life
We're nothing but our leather and our dreams
You gotta trust in the future of us
Believe posh life

[Post-Chours]
Posh life
Posh life
Posh life, until we bleed

[Verse 2]
Grew up north of the Florida Bay
Nineteen, moved to the big city to find a dream, to find a way
Ooh, burning concrete of lower east
Inscribing sharpie William's "H"
Passionately only serving him, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Where life is holding you down
And you're having trouble finding peace
You gotta be brave
Be brave, until you're bleeding
Where life is holding you hard in a place that it don't want to be
You gotta posh life
'Cause life is all you need

[Chorus]
We live a posh life
And the world says we're not brave until we bleed
You gotta trust in the future of us
Believe posh life
We live a posh life
We're nothing but our leather and our dreams
You gotta trust in the future of us
Believe posh life

[Post-Chours]
We live a posh life
A posh life
Posh life, until we bleed
Posh like
We live a posh life
Posh life
Posh life, until we bleed

[Bridge]
This ain't no chapel, ain't no Pauper's prison
We love this posh life for just one reason
We got each other when the church ain't giving
We love this posh life for just one reason

[Chorus]
We live a posh life
The world says we're not brave until we bleed
You gotta trust in the future of us
Believe
We live a posh life
We're nothing but our leather and our dreams
You gotta trust in the future of us
Believe posh life

[Post-Chours]
We live a posh life
A posh life
Posh life, until we bleed
Posh like
We live a posh life
Posh life
Posh life, until we bleed

[Chorus]
Ayy, ya heard about the good news?
Y'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?
Wake up, nigga, wake up
We 'bout to get this paper

[Verse 1]
Money never made me
Make me do something? Nah, can't make me
Even if the money low, can't pay me
Even if the money low, can't play me

[Chorus]
Ayy, ya heard about the good news?
Y'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?
Wake up, nigga, wake up
We 'bout to get this paper

[Verse 2]
Pablo bought a Rolie and a rottweiler
Seem like the more fame, I only got wilder
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us
I've been outta my mind a long time
I've been outta my mind a long time
I be saying how I feel at the wrong time
Might not come when you want but I'm on time

[Chorus]
Ayy, ya heard about the good news?
Y'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?
Wake up, nigga, wake up
We 'bout to get this paper

[Verse 3]
I can't let these people play me
Name one genius that ain't crazy
Follow our father
You borrow our motto
I'm a Chicago south sider
I'm a Chicago south sider

[Chorus]
Ayy, ya heard about the good news?
Y'all sleeping on your boy, had a good snooze?
Wake up, nigga, wake up
It's time to get the paper

[Verse 4]
I've been outta my mind a long time
I've been outta my mind a long time
I know, I know, I shouldn't even bother
With all these gossiping, no-pussy-getting bloggers
Fashion show in Gotham, I need another costume
PETA mad cause I made a jacket outta possum
Awesome, Steve Jobs mixed with Steve Austin
Rich slave in the fabric store picking cotton
If Hov J then every Jordan need a Rodman
Man, Jay, they don't really want no problems
Driving in the same car that they killed Pac in
Driving in the same urr that they killed Pac in
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us
Hands up, hands up, then the cops shot us

[Outro]
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Wait a second, everybody here, I'm the ghetto Oprah
You know what that mean? You get a fur! You get a fur!
You get a jet! You get a jet! Big booty bitch for you! Woo!

[Hook: J-Son]
Been through it all, that's why I grind hard
Me against the world, back up against the wall
Even through the rain, Imma still stand tall
Imma get my figures, better get yours
This is my story, this is my hustle
This is my grind, this is my struggle
I see paper in my eyes
That's why I'm grinding till i die

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
A superstar I am, I haven't dropped the classic
No illmatic, it was written, or I am
Honest to the public, that I am
Mr. 305, that I am
A rapper I'm not, perhaps that's you
A hater I'm not, perhaps that's you
Signed a fucked up deal, perhaps that's true
But I owe my publishing, unlike you
If you would look past, all my hits
Notice when I say, all my hits
Pits got a track record unlike them
Money made me see my enemies
Were really just my friends
They ride in the beginning, but not to the end
Money's what you got, not what you spend
Listen to this verse here closely
These boys off like butter
But they still wanna toast me
Put your hands up nice and slowly
This's a stick up, now give me what you owe me
TVT, now you know what it is
Imma make your name worldwide
For not paying us... shit!

[Hook: J-Son]
Been through it all, that's why I grind hard
Me against the world, back up against the wall
Even through the rain, Imma still stand tall
Imma get my figures, better get yours
This is my story, this is my hustle
This is my grind, this is my struggle
I see paper in my eyes
That's why I'm grinding till i die

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
My homeboys made house calls, kick in the doors
Get you three strikes that's right, then they out yo
I hear you take keys, but I doubt y'all
They talk weight when it's really like 8- balls
Just like powder, uh, yeah they soft
Off the coke like ross, then that's how they cake y'all
Treat you like a git, make you take your J's off
Hit you all night and make you take all your days off
Everyday a different day in every state
Different city, till you're caged in, never late
A life of a hustler, a real street boy
With a chopper, I'm street sweet boys
It happens too often down in, Dade county
Story of my life, but I stay grounded
These fuckboys wanna play, but they stay grounded
Allergic to paper, that's why they, not around me

[Hook: J-Son, Trazz]
Been through it all, that's why I grind hard
Me against the world, back up against the wall
Even through the rain, Imma still stand tall
Imma get my figures, better get yours
This is my story, this is my hustle
This is my grind, this is my struggle
I see paper in my eyes (Trazz!)
That's why I'm grinding till i die

[Verse 3: Trazz]
I love the paper, damn I'm such an addict
I'm might have stumbled, but still kept my balance
With such a fame got me going harder than Cialis
Its difficult for y'all, but for me, it ain't a challenge
The saying that they like me, that's so unlikely
Hustle all day, Trazz grind til they 

[?]
Try to pull back, but the game still excite me
I'm rolling like Gucci, so yeah bitch I might be
See I'm a president, I think it's evident
You only here overnight, I'm a resident
I'm blessed with it, niggas say the flow heaven sent
So fuck the fame, I can let the paper represent
I'm on my grind, but it's far from the greed
Money in my blood, so it's worth it when I bleed
These rappers all frail, they crumble like blue cheese
So believe me, it's all motivation like Jeezy

[Hook: J-Son, Pitbull]
Been through it all, that's why I grind hard
Me against the world, back up against the wall
Even through the rain, Imma still stand tall
Imma get my figures, better get yours
This is my story, this is my hustle
This is my grind, this is my struggle
I see paper in my eyes
That's why I'm grinding till i die
Woooooo!
Been through it all, that's why I grind hard
Me against the world, back up against the wall
Even through the rain, Imma still stand tall
Imma get my figures, better get yours
This is my story, this is my hustle
This is my grind, this is my struggle
I see paper in my eyes
That's why I'm grinding till i die

[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry? Oh
Cause I'm needing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry? Oh
Cause I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, baby
Yeah I'm sorry, sorry
Sorry

[Verse 2]
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry? Oh
Cause I'm needing more than just your body, baby
Is it too late now to say sorry? Oh
Cause I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, baby
Sorry, oh
Marky went and had a baby
And Sammy's on her way to crazy
And I'm just sitting feeling lucky
That I just slipped on by it all

And being friendly isn't funny
When you're seeing your old honey
Rolling like a dummy
Surprised that I slipped right on by it all

If they were looking at me, what would they see?
If they were looking at me, what would they see?
If they were looking at me, what would they see?
If they were looking at me, what would they see?

I'd imagine a laugh
Is what they would have
Which isn't so bad
When all their lives are riding on their wage

And being friendly isn't funny
When you're seeing your old honey
Rolling like a mommy
Surprised that I slipped right on by it all
If they were looking at me, what would they see?
If they were looking at me, what would they see?
If they were looking at me, what would they see?
If they were looking at me, what would they see?

[Intro]
You're my favorite

[Verse 1]
I treat my penthouse like basements, yeah (faded)
I treat a bad bitch like she basic, aw yeah (faded)
I hit three hundred hoes way before I was famous, yeah (faded)
I'm faded, I'm faded, I usually don't say shit (faded, faded)

[Pre-Chorus]
She would fuck with a nigga even if I ain't had no bitch
She wanna take it slow, I told that bitch to go pop some xans
She said, "I took about three, I don't know how long it's gon' last"
I tell her, "Shut the fuck up" 'cause she love when I talk like that

[Chorus]
I just wanna get you naked
I just wanna get you naked
I, I just wanna get you naked
Out of all the pussy you're my favorite (you're my favorite)

[Post-Chorus]
And all my niggas say, "Jay, you better chill, better know you're a keeper"
Bought you a Benz with the windows tinted, can't nobody see you
I just wanna get you naked
Out of all the pussy you're my favorite
Oh
Smoke that shit by the O
Fuck her so good she like oh
My nigga I'm a CEO, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Look we can talk about hits or talk about who I hit
Did a song with 2 Chainz but I was rockin' my shit
Yeah, I broke up with my ex, I ain't talk to her since
The only time I need a spark is when I light up my spliffs
Yeah, I been all around the world, probably write me a book
Three kitchens in the crib, I don't know how to cook
I got a mansion in Miami, I forgot how it look
All I need is two things and that's pussy and kush
Waving in the foreign, nigga, always
Got a nigga feeling like the God, I think I'm Charlamagne
Too much for all the plaques in my hallways

[Pre-Chorus]
She would fuck with a nigga even if I ain't had no bitch
She wanna take it slow, I told that bitch to go pop some xans
She said, "I took about three, I don't know how long it's gon' last"
I tell her, "Shut the fuck up" 'cause she love when I talk like that

[Chorus]
I just wanna get you naked (naked)
I just wanna get you naked (oh)
I, I just wanna get you naked (get you naked, baby)
Out of all the pussy you're my favorite (you're my favorite)

[Post-Chorus]
And all my niggas say, "Jay, you better chill, better know you're a keeper"
Bought you a Benz with the windows tinted, can't nobody see you
I just wanna get you naked (naked, ooh)
Out of all the pussy you're my favorite
Oh
Smoke that shit by the O
Fuck her so good she like oh
My nigga I'm a CEO, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Out of all the pussy you're my favorite, favorite, aw, aw no no no

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been livin' without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I've given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God, I'm willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
'Bout my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico?
Remember that last time, the episode?
Asking me why the hell I text in code?
Four times just to say, "Don't text me, ho"
Told you four times, "Don't test me, ho"
And we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'ma have the last laugh in the end
'Cause I'm from a tribe called "Check-a-ho"
Yeah, I'ma have to laugh in the end
'Cause I'm from a tribe called "Check-a-ho"
And I...

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

[Outro: Kanye West & Section 25]
See through the veil
And forget all of your cares
Throw them
Throw them away
Don't stop your loving
Don't stop for nothing
No, not for nothing
They don't wanna see me love you
Don't now, don't stop it
They always love it
They always wanna
They don't wanna see me love you
See through the veil
They don't wanna see me love you
And forget all your cares
They don't wanna see me love you
Throw them
Throw them away
Ooh, life's a feeling and
Ooh, the body is a feeling, yeah

[Produced by Cashmere Cat and Sinjin Hawke]

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Lost out, beat up
Dancin', down there
I found you, somewhere out
'Round 'round there, right right there
Lost and beat up
Down there, dancin'
I found you, somewhere out
Right down there, right 'round there

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lost and found out
Turned out, how you thought
Daddy found out
That you turned out how you turned out
If mama knew now
How you turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, I need you now
Love you (Got to)
Love you (Love you)
Found you, found you
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
If your mama knew how
You turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, and I need you now
Lost and found out

[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
Cry, I'm not sorry
Cry, who needs sorry when there's Hennessy?
Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah, I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you

[Verse 2: Sia]
I was lost and beat up
Turned out, burned up
You found me, through a heartache
Didn't know me, you were drawn in
I was lost and beat up
I was warm flesh, on Caesar
You found me, in your gaze
Well, I found me, oh, Jesus
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I need you now
Lost and found out
Yeah

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit, that's the tea, no sip
Don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip
We ain't trippin' on shit, we just sippin' on this
Just forget the whole shit, we could laugh about nothin'
I impreg-a-nate your mind, let's have a baby without fuckin', yo
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
Ayy, I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich
I said, "Baby, what if you was clubbin'
Thuggin', hustlin' before you met your husband?"
Then I said, "What if Mary was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph, around hella thugs?"
Cover Nori in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves
(What if Mary) "What if Mary
(Was in the club) Was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph with no love?"
Cover Saint in lambs' wool
(And she was) We surrounded by
(Surrounded by) The fuckin' wolves

[Verse]
Couldn't understand why things
Soon as the stooly sings
And it wasn't cause she couldn't control us
Look, i'm back like niggas on a bus
Oh i see you couldn't stop, it wasn't your fault, you couldn't restrain/
Who do you blame? it's a shame because the man's slain
Fuck it turn my mic up a lil bit
Too much greatness, you couldn't even grasp it
Damn, they wanna label me a menace
But still couldn't find any hope crevice
And i don't run counters no more
Couldn't find a thing worth fighting for,I couldn't imagine what would happen
She smiles; a niggas full of passion
I'm done thinking, this ain't enough drinking
Couldn't keep sleeping, but kept thinking

My whole crew dressed to kill, we be dead fresh
Like a walking dead man, yeah, we dead fresh
So fresh, too fresh, so well dressed
He be dead fresh, she be dead fresh
I did not diss Taylor Swift and I've never dissed her...

First thing is I'm an artist and as an artist I will express how I feel with no censorship

2nd thing   I asked my wife  for her blessings and she was cool with it

3rd thing    I called Taylor and had a hour long convo with her about the line and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings

4th Bitch is an endearing term in hip hop  like the word Nigga

5th  thing I’m not even gone take credit for the idea… it’s actually something Taylor came up with …

She was having dinner with one of our friends who’s name I will keep out of this and she told him

I can’t be mad at Kanye because he made me famous!  #FACTS

6th  Stop trying to demonize real artist     Stop trying to compromise art

That’s why music is so fucking watered down right now
I miss that DMX feeling
7th  I miss that feeling  so that’s what I want to help restore

8th   They want to control us with money and perception and mute the culture

but you can see at Madison Square Garden that you can stop us

9th   It felt like a seen from The Warriors     ALL GODS   ALL GODS ALL GODS in the buildin

not just the famous people there    but the kids   the moms the dads  the families that came to share this moment with us

[Intro: Arthur Russell]

You say you never saw this comin', well, you're not alone
Million dollar renovations to a happy home
My ex says she gave me the best years of her life
I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right
I wake up, assessin' the damages
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch
But it's blurry enough to get the fake out
I wake up, all veggies no eggs
I hit the gym, all chest no legs
Yep, then I made myself a smoothie
Yeah, then me and wifey make a movie
Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago

I remember being nervous to do Victoria's Secret
'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition
I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, like a private school for women
Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl
You don't love me, you just pretendin'
I need a happy beginnin', middle and endin'
Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
It's gettin' hot in here, that's all that I know
Got a hotel room, three stars for you
You call down for an omelet, girl, it's 5 in the morning
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl, don't start with me
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob'
'Cause you was in college complainin' 'bout it's no jobs
But you were suckin' a nigga dick the whole time
Well, I guess a blowjob's better than no job

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I drove back thirty hours, uh

[Spoken Word: Kelly Price]
You want me to give you a testimony about my life
And how good He's been to me
I don't know what to tell you about Him
I love Him so much with all my heart and my soul
With every bone in my body, I love Him so much
Because He's done so much for me
Every morning
Every day of my life
I won't always be crying tears
In the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up
By myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day
I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do
And how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it
How I'm gonna get there because He...
He's gonna be there for me
Some day the sky above will open up
And He will reach out His hand and guide me through
Oh, yes He will
I won't always be crying these tears
I won't always be feeling so blue
Some day, He will open up the door for me
And call my name
Some day He will
I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like
No matter what you've been through
Or where you've been He's always there
With His arms open wide
Accepting me
For who I am
And I love Him so much
I couldn't do it without Him, I wouldn't want to
Oh, I'm crying now
It feels so good to be free
To be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what
Oh, Lord thank You
You are the joy of my life

[Verse 1]
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished

Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days
Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away
I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon
I ain't dropped the album but the shoes went platinum (Woo!)
Every time I talk they say I'm too aggressive
I was out here spazzin', all y'all get the message?
On the field I'm over-reckless, on my Odell Beckham
2020, I'ma run the whole election, yah!
I've been trending years, y'all a couple days
Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised
Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves
Gave LeBron a billi' not to run away (Yo)

Yeah, we made a million a minute, we made a million a minute, ah!
Do anybody feel bad for Bill Cosby?
Did he forget the names just like Steve Harvey? (Yo)
Tell Adidas that we need a million in production (Yo)
I done told y'all, all I needed was the infrastructure (Boom!)
Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion
James Harden, Swaggy P runnin' up the budget (Yoga flame!)
Keep the work at my baby mama's mama's house
I'm a jerk, you need to work, you need to call my spouse
Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture with me on Rodeo
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I might do my own hotel
Couches, couches, couches, couches, which one should I pick?
I need extra deep, I like my bitches extra thick (sonic boom!)
Every time I see the news, man it bring me home
Call up DJ Mano, shout out Twilite Tone
We just blessed to be alive, yeah ain't that the truth?
So let's celebrate the life of Timbuck2
Timbuck2, Timbuck2, Timbuck2

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Up in the mornin', miss you bad
Sorry I ain't call you back, same problem my father had
All this time, all he had, all he had
And what he dreamed, all his cash
Market crashed, hurt him bad
People get divorced for that
Dropped some stacks, pops is good
Mama passed in Hollywood
If you ask, lost my soul
Drivin' fast, lost control
Off the road, jaw was broke
'Member we all was broke

[Chorus: Kanye West & Desiigner]
I just wanna feel liberated, I, I, I (Hey)

(Na na na SHOOP)
I've got so much love to give
In my heart I know you see

[Break 1: T-Pain]
You won't believe
The things
I've been
Through to be right here
I almost died just to get to you
I'd go to hell
And to hell again
I'd badly go back and forth
From the mountain tops
From door to door
Let the whole world know

[Refrain 1: T-Pain]
Baby I'm officially yours
What was I doing before

Officially yours

But you take control over me
Oooh, you know what to do
And it's working

Please believe it
Go from the mountain tops
Door to door to door
Let the whole world know

[Refrain 2: T-Pain]
Baby I'm officially yours
What was I doing before

Officially yours
(Na na na, SHOOP)
Oooooh look up further no more
Now baby im officially yours

[Outro: T-Pain]
(Na na na, SHOOP)

[Verse]
I miss the old Kanye, straight from the Go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See, I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
Called "I Miss The Old Kanye"? Man, that'd be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye

[Verse 1:Lil Yachty]
Up late night, bitch I'm feeling like I'm Jimmy Fallon
10 diamond rings on my hand like I'm good at sports
Bought a new crib and that bitch came with a tennis court
Flexin' should have been a sport
I done took it all the way
August 23, Mark your calendar, that's RD day
Walked up in that bitch with two bitches you ain't never seen
Perfect parts got me so clean
Paint the Glock white, add the laser, that's vanilla bean
Oops I meant vanilla beam
Counting so much money that my fingers started turning green
Winning so damn much that I now here go by as Charlie Sheen
All these hoes is easy bust
In my squad is who i trust
Old ass rappers talking dust, niggas need to die
One time this bitch had hurt my feelings, so i went to ice the pain
VVS my whole team
Ballin' like I'm Larry Bird
Drop that bitch off at the curb
She was asking too much questions
Nah bitch I'm never stressin
Youngest nigga ever flexin
You broke if yo ass stressin
Yo bitch who my ass texting
Fucked yo bitch head, then I told her that she not a slut
Lyin cuz i ain't give no fucks
Drop my nut all on her butt
Xans got my body stuck
Leaning I might need a crutch
Call up K Supreme, and we about to pour a whole eighth
None of you pussy niggas safe
Keep my cash all in a safe
Smoking good and living great
Features come with pricy rates
Living like the Apple State
Nigga, Oooh!

[Hook]
Young RD always had alot of bitches
Pullin up on switches, diamond chain viscious
Hoes loving me cuz I'm balling like a piston
I'm balling like a piston
I'm balling like a piston (2x)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty}​​​​​​
Man, shout out my nigga Christian
She always keep my braids lit
Fuck with her your neck split
Whole gang coming for the top like a volcano
First check and these niggas put they mama in a range rover
Some put in a bankroll
I got old money, I should by my self a Kangol
Got whips like Django and bitches like James Franco
Diamonds dancing hard, so my necklace doing the tango
My bitches look like angels, got stripes like a Bengal
Now - Media Takeout - always remember that you dissed the collection that changed the world

You seem like the type of organization hired to always keep dreamers down. when certain things in history happen you just got to respect it

Respect the struggle. respect the hustle. respect the dreams.  respect the movement

I had an album listening and clothing presentation and Madison Square Garden

People were crying. people were throwing up the fist. people were dancing

But Media Takeout couldn't say one thing positive knowing damn well you'd love to be on the YEEZY 350 list

You probably got bootleg Yeezy's on right now

I'm a human being. I'm an artist, bro

Your site is entertaining and hilarious but certain things are just too far. you have no idea what I've had to go through

So many people didn't make it and gave everything they had for me to stand on their shoulders and break through fashion

Fashion ain't no joke for me. It's a way of life. creative expression and industry
I've given everything I had for this moment. a lot of people feel it's the paradigm shift

And I'm proud of this picture with me and Caitlyn. She gave the most heart felt speech at my wedding

And was there in full support to see me realize this dream

Wow the paradigm  has shifted, She killed it. everything is changed now!!!! Lil Sis kiiiiiiiilled this shit!!!!!!!

HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA FUCK ALL THE HATERS   PUT YOUR MIUTHERFUCKING FIST IN THE SKY RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'M SO HYPE RIGHT NOW    EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED  . HAVE YA'LL EVER SEEN TRON? THE END OF THE TRON WHERE EVERYTHING LIGHT UP!!!!

HAD TO ALL CAPS THIS!!!!!! NO MORE RULES.. MAKE YOUR OWN RULES.   ok now back to finishing Pablo

Thank you my brother Ricardo

[Intro]
I don't pay for shit nigga
Fingers ashy but the diamonds glisten so it evens out
Money greener than some Brussels sprouts
Flip the work I'm like an acrobatic
Pussy nigga know he don't want static
Test Lil Yachty boy its gon' be tragic

[Verse 1]

[?] yea I made magic
Make it happen
Yea I'm happy
Fuck the work up like I'm Charlie Sheen
Want to be Yachty hah in his dreams
I am a real Ben Franklin fiend
In high school I made guap off of the beams
Serving selling like a mad team
I can't cop the Glock unless it got the beam

[Interlude]
Y'all niggas 

[?] this motherfucker you feel me
Give a fuck what you think, give a fuck what you thought nigga
I just want all my motherfucking bread blue bills you know what I'm saying
I need my blue bills like I was crip or some shit you feel me
I'm 'bout that you feel me
I'm 'bout that bread you feel me
I ain't Jesus I don't got to break bread, this shit mine
I want all that shit

[Verse 2]
My new bitch smell like some cinnamon
K takin xans like they vitamins
All my niggas fuck up the whole fuck up
Never gave a fuck, I'm stuck up
If you broke then shut the fuck up
Lil Yachty I'm next up
All of my niggas be riding
All of my niggas be shot gun robbing for real
Popping like C4
Flyer than g4
I skrt in a two door
You faker than decor
I squat her like deploy
She sucking on the boy
No I'm not a d-boy
But I bring the checks in I get that work in
Make sure my momma not stressing
Make sure my game never resting
We working, working like it's Christmas time at Walmart
Pussy nigga don't get smart
Chopper, chopper pointing at his heart
Better not move nigga
Better be cool nigga
Silly rabbit
Nigga softer than a comfy fabric
Bitch I ball like a fucking Maverick
What's my name
Paul ... The most powerful messenger of the first century... Now we stand here 20 centuries later... Because he was a traveler...

He was a learned man not of the original sect so he was able to take the message to the rest of the world...

He was saved from persecution due to his Roman citizenship... I have the right to speak my voice...

Please forgive the profanity and give hugs and blessings to my brother Kirk for standing by me... In a few hours the journey begins...

All memes are wrong... The Life of Paul... The life of Pablo... Ultralight beams... Moms dads daughters sons stand up...

Let's dance in the streets. I am consumed by my purpose to help the world

I write this to you my brothers while still 53 million dollars in personal debt... Please pray we overcome... This is my true heart...

This is all all is fun all in good feelings... We will all be gone 100 years from now but what did we do to help while we were here!!!

They are calling me to the SNL stage now ... Speak soon...

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Straight to the bank, straight to the bank
Straight to the bank
Go to the money, go straight to the bank
Pour up a pint, pour up the drank
Go straight to the bank
Hop in the lambo, go straight to the bank
Run to the money, go straight to the bank
Straight to the bank
Pour up a pint, man pour up the drank
Buy me a pound and buy me some drank
And go straight to the bank
Me and Pablo going straight to the bank
Hundred thousand when I break in the safe
Straight to the bank
All of my niggas go straight to the bank

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Ay, shoot a nigga ‘til he dead
Seven hundred for a pint of red
Hop out the Rari, you heard what I said
Young nigga shoot you in your head
Half of them niggas ain’t did what I did
Smoking on gas, you smoking on mid
Designer everything, fuck with the kid
Swerve the Lambo through Atlanta
Scarface, west side, Tony Montana
Pour up a four, Gucci bandana
Dipset, Juelz Santana
Fifty thousand for my pinky ring
Another 60 thousand just for the Cuban link
Pouring up Act and I’m pouring up red
Mix the two and the two, man you know that I’m drinking lean

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Straight to the bank, straight to the bank
Straight to the bank
Go to the money, go straight to the bank
Pour up a pint, pour up the drank
Go straight to the bank
Hop in the lambo, go straight to the bank
Run to the money, go straight to the bank
Straight to the bank
Pour up a pint, man pour up the drank
Buy me a pound and buy me some drank
And go straight to the bank
Me and Pablo going straight to the bank
Hundred thousand when I break in the safe
Straight to the bank
All of my niggas go straight to the bank

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Posted on the block with blocks like a 

[?]
Got too many bitches, I need me a storage
Walk around leaving blood on the floor
Dead people everywhere like a morgue
Go to the bank in my Soulja Boys
I’m rocking designers, you can’t afford
You a little boy, nigga still on the porch
I got big bricks, little Honda Accord
Nigga don’t ask what I paid for it
Bury that money like graveyard
Me and Soulja got more money than Floyd
Keep the chopper on me, nigga I’m paranoid
Trap nigga, I be serving that brack
Lamborghini got a stick like Atari
Pull up to the bank and make a deposit
Plug saying that he gon’ be here tomorrow

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
Straight to the bank, straight to the bank
Straight to the bank
Go to the money, go straight to the bank
Pour up a pint, pour up the drank
Go straight to the bank
Hop in the lambo, go straight to the bank
Run to the money, go straight to the bank
Straight to the bank
Pour up a pint, man pour up the drank
Buy me a pound and buy me some drank
And go straight to the bank
Me and Pablo going straight to the bank
Hundred thousand when I break in the safe
Straight to the bank
All of my niggas go straight to the bank

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
And she's like, "Can you undo my bra strap?"
I try to play it cool, in my head I'm like, "Aw yeah!"
Then she's like "I'm tired" and I'm like "Aw, man"
I was 'bout to crush the coochie like a tall can (Yeah)
Cause my girl's thick (thick!), she got a booty mane
And a big old belly looking like Gucci Mane
I keep my jewelry on, she love my dookie chain
Cause guess what! (what?) That's my boo boo thang. (who?)
My boo boo thang. (who?) My boo boo thang
She get too comfortable, bathroom door open when she boo boo-ing
I whisper in her ear, "Are you awake?"
Kissed her on her neck, said "Good night. You my babe."

[Chorus: Ryan Bedard]
Every time I go to sleep
I wish that you were next to me
Two people that were meant to be
Under the sheets
I'm spooning you, you're spooning
Every time I go to sleep
I wish that you were next to me
Two people that were meant to be
Under the sheets
I'm spooning you, you're spooning me

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Me and you, let's get lost in these bed sheets
At the very least press my D against your left cheek
She said Fifty Shades of Grey was the best read
I'm more of a Giving Tree type of guy, Shel Silverstein (He's awesome)
She keeps talking, might as well be in a seminar
I'm stuck, completely numb in my left arm
Her knees are bony, I need my homies
And that sounds weird, but I need my homies. (YUP)
You watched ahead on the fourth season of Game of Thrones? (Aw hell nah!)
I hold that against you (hmm mm!)
I want to forgive you, but inside I'm resentful
With your lame claims that we had different schedules! (we didn't!)
I've seen your Netflix queues, you're busted!
Can I even trust you, do you even know what love is?!
She put her hand on my D and started to rub it
All a sudden I succumb, say "Fuck it" and then busted (sleep tight)

[Chorus: Ryan Bedard]
Every time I go to sleep
I wish that you were next to me
Two people that were meant to be
Under the sheets
I'm spooning you, you're spooning
Every time I go to sleep
I wish that you were next to me
Two people that were meant to be
Under the sheets
I'm spooning you, you're spooning me

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Don't trip girl, you know I got you
Let's take it all off, no costumes
See I'm a man, but every now and then in bed I know when to say: "Alright, it's my turn to be the small spoon."
But tonight, I put my hands around your waist
Feel those little prickly hairs that you missed shaving your legs and say, "Good night my love, it's been one hell of a day."
And you reply, "I'm sleeping... space"

[Outro: Macklemore]
Every time I go to sleep
I wish that you were next to me
Two people that were meant to be
Under the sheets
I'm spooning you, you're spooning me
Spoon me
2015
*Laughing*

[Intro]
We got London on the track
Got my bae with me, you know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus]
If she don’t get what she want she whine
I reminisce when I get high (I'm so high)
Looked up baby and say goodbye
I tied my ties, she no longer cry, look you in your eyes
Tell you that

[Verse 1]
I know she livin' for a nigga, dyin' for a nigga
I whip that pussy with no ballers jumpin' out, lil' nigga
That pussy look just like a cut, a soakin' cut, lil' nigga (Woah)
Yeah, I'm a freak, you know I'm pullin' up to lush, lil' nigga (On Blood)
I'd never snooze to lose, I would never snooze to lose on you
Yeah, I'ma give you a couple bands, want some more boobs on you (Want some more)
Hey, I'ma sit back and pay attention like school on you
Yeah, I'ma shoot inside that pussy like a wholly on you
Goddamn, I'm sorry, B, I know you'd accepted my apology
I know that ass fat, apple bottom please
I need a deep throat baby, swallow me
I love it when you're around baby, follow me (Follow)
I only eat green, yeah, koala leaf
We shoot with big guns like a Call of D
She never say no, she ain't stallin' me
I kept my heart locked up in a safe, hey
You can't shoot with a pistol, need a K (Ha)
No, you can't see it, it is tragic by your face (Ooh)
But when it need air, let it out in a safe lil' place
I can see it on her face

[Chorus]
If she don’t get what she want she whine
I reminisce when I get high
Looked up baby and say goodbye
I tied my ties, she no longer cry, look you in your eyes
Tell you that, I know she worth
No these ain't no drugs, I know she worth
Yah, my mama say that she ain’t perfect
But if this is how I'm feelin', it's gonna work
Yeah, roll me some kush I don't want no purp (hey)

[Verse 2]
Damn, I broke her heart, now my heart hurt
I don't know why but I done cut down on that syrup
At least I got that lil' bitch ballin', she don't gotta work
Oh-no-no, she ain't had no job, but she having purses
Yeah-yeah-yeah, she know I'm the truth, places I'm in first
No-no-no, I don't want you bitches, y'all basic and thirsty (Y'all soft)
Yeah-yeah, she taught me well, it took some time, but it was worth it
She get on top and she ride it, Kentucky derby
You should see, I count that money like a nerd bitch
I'ma ball some with my dawgs but they ain't Courage
Her whole body same color, I call it perfect

[Chorus]
Since she don't get what she want she whine
I reminisce when I get high (Yeah)
Looked up baby and say goodbye (Bobby Bruh)
I tied my ties, she no longer cry, look you in your eyes
Tell you that, I know she worth
No, these ain't no drugs, I know she worth
Yah, my mama say that she ain’t perfect
But if this is how I'm feelin', it's gonna work
Yeah, roll me some kush I don't want no purp
Ya this one right here for my trill niggas
All my real niggas out here in these streets
Grinding, hustling on the block
Whatever you doing
You got a fucking job whatever
Like this is that shit right here
Real music

[Intro: Meek Mill]
For all my real niggas
For all my niggas that ain't here
For all my niggas that's down right now

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now this one is for my trill niggas
On the block, moving that rock, ducking cops all my real niggas
To get this change another chain nigga
On the block, moving them things, switching lanes on them lame niggas
And this one is for my young niggas
On the block, busting them shots, ducking cops don't be dumb niggas
Just bring your all and get these ones niggas
Never rat, never fold, niggas approach you bust your gun nigga

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
When I cry, I cry real tears
For all my niggas that died wish I could back years
And bring them back here
For all my niggas locked and got life years
I'm on my grind all the time this the last year
We gon' starve flea on dog
There's no limit to what I do, I'm Master P on guard
For that relish green like the Celtics nigga we ball hard
On the block running that rock like a b ball yard
I ain't trying to be the hottest I'm trying to get my mind straight
Tweety school private, a million dollar bank account
Cruising on the island, tricking bitches
Reminiscing how we used to wild 'em
Play the game foulin'
The water ain't deep 'til you swimming with piranhas
With blood trailing from you and they swimming right behind you
The hood no good everybody think they riding
Until you catch them slipping put some shit up in they noggin
They rather see you shot up before they see you pop up
The chain around your neck all fresh pulling that drop up
I came around the set nothing less where niggas cop up
So I had no choice but to grind and get this guap up
Ever since a boy just my moms and my poppa
The streets been the old head they raised me as a rider
I don't really fuck with rap I do it cause I got to
I do it for my fans and for my mans for the dollars

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now this one is for my trill niggas
On the block, moving that rock, ducking cops all my real niggas
To get this change another chain nigga
On the block, moving them things, switching lanes on them lame niggas
And this one is for my young niggas
On the block, busting them shots, ducking cops don't be dumb niggas
Just bring your all and get these ones niggas
Never rat, never fold, niggas approach you bust your gun nigga

[Verse 2: ]
I know I bring you pain same time bring you joy
Through all the shit we've been through you know I'm still your boy
You know I'mma ride we still got each other
Taking care of lil' brother you my one and only mother
Look we ain't doing bad in fact we doing good
I'mma make it with this rap we gon' make it out the hood
Put his hands on you I wish a nigga would
Coming through strapped up black mac black hood
Was locked down for a minute I wasn't gone long
I left you a little 

[?] I know I was wrong
You wrote me back to back letters told me stay strong
I had rainy days you was with me through the storm
That's why I show you love dry your eyes give me hugs
Nineteen years strong I ain't go without the grub
You and my pop had up and downs
Even though y'all separated everyday you used to come around
That's why I love you mom, and I love you dad
Your little soldier gon' go far with this pen and pad
I know I'm sinning bad but ain't nobody perfect
If being broke ain't a joke ain't nobody smirking
I know I pushed my little dime down time to time
But I'm stuck in the hood fuck it I got to grind
Its gon' be real when I sign the line
Cause I'mma get you paradise my little ain't have to grind
Cause I'm going to to do it for him I know he watching me
They way I living hell Lil' 

[?] couldn't tell
I give him what he want make him think its all well
But he don't see that razor and that work up on that scale
Winter time grind with the woolrich and the Taurus
Its 

[?] but you know you got to take them orders
You got to move them quarters that's how you get them o's
Got to crawl before you walk that's just how the game goes

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now this one is for my trill niggas
On the block, moving that rock, ducking cops all my real niggas
To get this change another chain nigga
On the block, moving them things, switching lanes on them lame niggas
And this one is for my young niggas
On the block, busting them shots, ducking cops don't be dumb niggas
Just bring your all and get these ones niggas
Never rat, never fold, niggas approach you bust your gun nigga

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I remember days being dead broke
I got so motherfucking hungry man my head hurt
I had to get myself together make my head work
Man at the same time keep my rap career first
But everybody know the hood can be the worst distraction
And when a nigga disrespect you gun's your first reaction
That's how we living in the struggle all we got is pride
So when a nigga take it from you shit you got to ride
Murder homicide
So by all means necessary I'mma strive
To get my momma out the hood since my father died
If you don't you don't shine shit I got to try
A made man a brave man nigga I am I
You keep your faith in money I keep mine in God
And the only thing that's funny watch as I survive
On the road to the riches
Me and my niggas counting dough
Fucking these hoes getting digits let's go

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now this one is for my trill niggas
On the block, moving that rock, ducking cops all my real niggas
To get this change another chain nigga
On the block, moving them things, switching lanes on them lame niggas
And this one is for my young niggas
On the block, busting them shots, ducking cops don't be dumb niggas
Just bring your all and get these ones niggas

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
They say he don't rap no more
They say like LeBron he ain't got the heat no more
They say he ain't street no more
But like Jay say "How sick am I? I wish you health" fosho
But I'm cool with it, act a fool with it
Went to one of my old neighborhoods and built a school in it
It's crazy baby the way that the 80's made me
I thank God every day that music saved me
I thank my mom for all the vision she gave me
I thank Miami for the way you raised me

[Chorus: Robin Thicke (Pitbull)]
I'm a bad man, in an evil world
(That's right)
And you're my type of goody two-shoes girl
(Give it to me baby)
Baby I'm a bad man, in a woman's world
(Ha, ha)
Come on over, give me what I deserve
(Give it to me baby)

[Refrain: Robin Thicke]
Are you ready for love?
Come and get it, girl
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Oooh
Come and get it, girl
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Oooh

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Building a billion dollar business from an ounce
Not bad for a Cuban that came from the south
Mami let's make like tig ol' bitties and bounce
Or we can make like a baby and head out
I'm cool with it, act a fool with it
Made my own playbook, I got no rules in it
I like the girls that's freaky, wild, yeah, and crazy
I like the girls that dirty dance, I'm Swayze
I like the girls that's hot, fiery and blazing
I like the girls that like the sex amazing

[Chorus: Robin Thicke (Pitbull)]
I'm a bad man, in an evil world
(That's right)
And you're my type of goody two-shoes girl
(Give it to me baby)
Baby I'm a bad man, in a woman's world
(Ha, ha)
Come on over, give me what I deserve
(Give it to me baby)

Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Oooh
Come and get it, girl
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Oooh

[Bridge: Pitbull]
I'm a bad man
I know how to move in a room full of wolves
Baby, I'm a bad man
I'm a good man, good guy, but don't get it confused
Baby, I'm a bad man
And I still fight every day like I ain't got nothing to lose
That's right

[Chorus: Robin Thicke (Pitbull)]
I'm a bad man, in an evil world
(That's right)
And you're my type of goody two-shoes girl
(Give it to me baby)
Baby I'm a bad man, in a woman's world
(Ha, ha)
Come on over, give me what I deserve
(Give it to me baby)

Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Oooh
Baby, I'm a bad man
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Oooh
I just feel rich people are always too cool to ask for help trying to impress each other at dinner parties

I want to help the world and I need help to do it. I am an artist and I care about humanity

Yes I am personally rich and I can buy furs and houses for my family

But I need access to more money in order to bring more beautiful ideas to the world

If I spent my money on my ideas I could not afford to take care of my family. I am in a place that so many artist end up

Also for anyone that has money they know the first rule is to use other people's money

I could not have done the MSG without Adidas but world, what I'm telling you is that was just a small sketch for what I will bring you

There are people who support artist and philanthropist

And I think the idea of being a celebrity a lot of times blocks the understanding of what my purpose is

I am of service to the world with my art and I just want to serve more

I am ultra light beaming right now. So many people have called or emailed to help today hedge fund guys billionaires etc...
I know I confuse you guys sometimes but please bare with me

This is a God dream

But if the self proclaimed cockiest person in the world can lay his personal business on the line then please people see my heart

No matter what level you're at in life there is still a struggle

And a balance art family perception friends family politics and the fucking manipulators


People wanted me to tweet again well here's some tweets!!!

[Intro]
We still at it mane
Ain't never lost a step
Take some of the low end out of my voice
Put some delay on there

[Verse 1]
Make your money don't let it make you
I learned that if you work hard it's funny where it'll take you
Probably roll you one up and bake you
I'm constantly on my job to see what's on my plate
Did it all without getting thank you I'm holding rank, rollin' dank
Porsche Carrera, 9 11, rollerskatin' see the city through my drapes
So what a tape
Smoke good weed to compliment my brain, ripped jeans to compliment my J's
I grind weed to put it in a j, on magazines and that center stage
What you make in a year I'm get in a day
Drink my fears away, work hard so I blew all my peers away
I'm smokin' strong to clear my brain, thankin' god I'm here today
Just long as my niggas safe, and all of my business straight
I'ma be able to move, cop some land and renovate
Plus I'm about to have a son, so I have to demonstrate
How to always stay real when the world giving you fake, fake, fake, fake, fake

[Hook]
When the world giving you fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Cause it ain't 'bout having a lot, it's 'bout you having some
Cause you could have it all but you still feel like you got none
When the world giving you fake, fake, fake, fake, fake

[Verse 2]
When the world giving you fake it ain't hard to stay real
Niggas say they gon' run up on you believe they will
I'm from Pittsburgh where they kill and they deal
Young niggas itchin' to pop a nigga like a pain pill
Don't even mention the homicide outside it's way real
Some of my niggas is dead, in jail, or tryna' make bail
Young nigga listen told him stay out the streets he chill
Got a little older keep saying he won't, he will
Got shot a lil' bit ago now it's poppin' when I see him I just talk to him
Roll some weed up tell him 'bout shit that he don't wanna be
What can happen to the act if he don't wanna clean
The life he live the consequences he don't wanna see
The game's over, rich icon, chain smoker
The watch face cold, like it was playin' poker
Pot grower, party not-goer
Always not sober, shades on my face when the world's giving you fake, fake, fake, fake, fake

[Hook]
When the world's giving you fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Cause it ain't 'bout having a lot, it's 'bout you having some
Cause you could have it all but feel like you got none
When the world's giving you fake, fake, fake, fake, fake

[Outro]
Ya man
There's a lot of fake shit that the world got to offer
Fake niggas, fake jewerly, fake weed, fake friends
Fake cars, fake clothes
Don't buy into the bullshit
Tell yourself first
MonstaBeatz, Taylor Gang, you know what it is

[Verse]
It's been a week already, feeling weak already
Got me at peak, possibility of what could be
Situation is heavy, I've got to prove
On February 26th I lost my life too
It's like I'm here in a dark dream
Nightmare, hear screams recorded
Say that it sounds distorted but they know who it was
That was me yelling for help when he drowned in his blood
Why didn't he defend himself? Why couldn't he throw a punch?
And for our community do you know what this does?
Add to a trail of hatred
2012 was taped for the world to see
Set us back another 400 years
This is modern day slavery
The reason why I'm by your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
Every piece of your brain
'Til your son jumped in your arm
Cut off the engine then sped off in the rain
I'm on the dash with my bible in the trunk
Had the vodka on the top
How come I can long time
How come I could make it popular?
Puff on what I want
How come I could make it popular?
Puff on what I want
See I'm living with anxiety
Giving up sobriety
Cussing with his sister
And playing with society
Justice ain't free
Therefore justice ain't me
Try and justify staying, obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time, I go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinking to myself
Hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinking by myself
At the end of Section Park
Caught you when you walk besides your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
Every piece of your brain
'Til your spine drip to your arm
Cut off the engine then sped off in a wraith
I said Hiiipower, one time you see it
Hiiipower, two times, you see it
Hiiipower, two times you see it
Conversation for the entire nation this is bigger than us
I want to thank the fans for the last 10 years, and the recording academy for giving us this unbelievable honor. I want to thank all of the collaborators that you see on this stage. Mostly, I want to thank my co-executive producer Max Martin, who has deserved to be up here for 25 years. And as the first woman to win album of the year at the Grammy's twice, I want to say to all the young women out there, there are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame. But if you just focus on the work and you don't let those people sidetrack you, someday when you get where you're going, you will know it was you and the people who love you who put you there,  and that will be the greatest feeling in the world. Thank you for this moment.

[Intro]
Hey, you know, a lot of y'all out there man really running y'all mouth
Like you just like to hear yourself talk, you know what I mean?
Talk so much, not knowing if the wagon make the more noise man
Haha, get you some money, man

[Hook]
Lotta nigga talk, you don't ever get paid
Fuck nigga hate, broke bitches throw the shade
Lotta nigga talk, you don't ever get paid
Still kickin' shit, make a bitch go crazy
Lotta nigga talk, you don't ever get paid
Fuck nigga hate, broke bitches throw the shade

[Verse 1]
Still kickin' flav', got my swag on turn up
Came with a zip, let the whole thing burn up
All I know, get dough, keep it pimpin'
Taught me that in '85, never learned nothin' different
All I see is haters in my rear view
Millions in my windshield, got a clear view
I trained myself, go deaf for a broke nigga
That way when you're talkin' I don't hear you, listen
Still poppin', give a shit about me
Fuck that shit you talkin', look at you, see you ain't bout it
Look at you, see you don't want it
Should hardly be an opponent
When you sittin' next to TIP, it look inferior, don't it?
Give a damn if you don't know
I've achieved everything you could hope for
If being a real nigga turned into a corporation
Look at me, shawty, I should be the logo
Please no photos as I stepped in that Magic
Got four hoes in the two door Bentley, what's happenin'?
She with the action, then she come in with me
But if not I leave her, she mean nothin' to me
I pull up, hop out, give the valet my keys
I run the city, bitch, I'm parkin' for free
And who the nigga right here talkin' to me?
There gon' be problem if you keep botherin' me, man
I came in this bitch to spend 20's and 50 G
What you tried to park here? That ain't my Bentley
You can't listen to me now, God as my witness
Keep on in your earnin's I take your opinion
I swear, nigga

[Hook]
Lotta nigga talk, you don't ever get paid
Fuck nigga hate, broke bitches throw the shade
Lotta nigga talk, you don't ever get paid
Still kickin' shit, make a bitch go crazy
Lotta nigga talk, you don't ever get paid
Fuck nigga hate, broke bitches throw the shade

[Verse 2]
Focused on the money; fuck shit? forget about it
I bought a Lamborghini, wrecked it, give a shit about it
Get up out it, call an Uber, go and buy a new one
I gotta run a bag up, it's extra for the blue one
Got 500 bags off in Chattanooga
Go and put it up and take a 100 motor gang here
Two rules, gettin' money, nigga, stay real
At all costs, nigga, at all costs, nigga
Take a hit of this and run your balls off
And, nigga, you ain't really beefin' if you called off
Play a bit to the left, call it southpaw
Fuck around, get your mouth wired, gotta weed y'all
Better stand down before I be a man
Drown guns up, hands down, that's exactly how I caught y'all
Okay one day I retire, put me in the hall of fame
But you lames don't forget what I done taught ya'll
I put the fear of God in ya
Oh you nigga hard is ya?
I can see the broad in ya, put your cut
Then you gotta make a move, make a choice
Either go out like a bitch or get your ass kicked
God damn that'll be horrible
So pipe down, nigga

[Hook]
Lotta nigga talk, you don't ever get paid
Fuck nigga hate, broke bitches throw the shade
Lotta nigga talk, you don't ever get paid
Still kickin' shit, make a bitch go crazy
Lotta nigga talk, you don't ever get paid
Fuck nigga hate, broke bitches throw the shade

[Intro]

BH, flamers
Ya you, you bitch ass nigga
You know how we do
Blood gang sucker

[Verse]
This is where the game stops
When my hammer to your head and that chain pop
I had them carry you to bed when that thing chopped
Flame chopped brains dropped on the same block
Where your mains watched
Them niggas pussies, I catch them in the same spot
Different day, same Glock
Sunny weather, rain shots
We live by the day, run with metal sling shots
Arm ready fire squeeze make his whole body freeze
How many niggas down to ride I want to know
When this time to catch that body who gon' say they want to go
Matter fact, I don't care put that 40 on my belt
On the mission for that man 'til I turn him into dust
What, I flow haze burning in the dust
You more like regular burning in a blunt
I'm hotter than I ever was burning what I want
Any track come on, every single one
Now back to that real shit how niggas get done
Dirty in the field, that's why its thirty in there still
All I really need me is a birdy and a wheel
Quick fast sell four shit, stash in the door shit
Super dirty cops come, gas to the floor shit
Double pipe, 

[?] flash like a 

[?]
Blood gang who we are, y'all niggas bullshit
We live upon money murder, robin' extortion
Riding and torching, anything that's in the way
Going through it blowing on I could die any day
But I ride any way, this is that crack music
Can't feel my face what he say wind it back music

[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
Cry, I'm not sorry
Cry, who needs sorry when there's Hennessey?
Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you

[Verse 2: Sia]
I was lost and beat up
Turned out, burned up
You found me, through a heartache
Didn't know me, you were drawn in
I was lost and beat up
I was warm flesh, unseasoned
You found me, in your gaze
I found you, oh Jesus

I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild

[Bridge: Kanye West]
And I need you now
Lost in my doubt

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit, that's the tea, no sip
Don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip
We ain't trippin' on shit, we just sippin' on this
Just forget the whole shit, we could laugh about nothin'
I impregnate your mind, let's have a baby without fuckin', yo
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin'
Thuggin', hustlin' before you met your husband?
Then I said, "What if Mary was in the club
When she met Joseph around hella thugs?
Cover Nori in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves"
"What if Mary was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph with no love?
Cover Saint in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves"
{Snippet}

[Meek Mill ]

Ever since I met you babe I couldn't fight this feeling, oh no
I'm the type to give you everything I have, she's priceless for real oh
You don't ever have to do a thing but give me all your love and affection, oh
You have something going for yourself, that's the type of girl for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Take you on a trip right by my side to a special place where we belong
So many things that are on my mind, can't wait to get you all alone

[Chorus]
Hey girl, you're something out a magazine
You're something on a movie screen
Hey girl, I need you, more than words can say
Hey girl, you're something like a silhouette
What you see is what you get
Hey girl, I need you, more than words can say

[Verse 2]
Ever since you looked into my eyes nothing seems to phase me, oh
There's no one who ever satisfied, stolen love can make me, oh
Fell the way you do, its something in the way you do
The way you move your body girl

Take you on a trip right by my side to a special place where we belong
So many things that are on my mind, can't wait to get you all alone

Don't fuck with me. Don't fuck with me. By fifty percent, dead or alive. By fifty percent for the next thousand years. Stanley Kubrick, Ye.

[Hook]
Shhh, I got a secret x2
Shhh, come closer
(come here bitch)
Smack some sense in your ass x4
Like a pimp, like a, like a pimp
Smack some sense in your ass x2

[Verse 1]
Like a pimp on your ass
I hope I offended your ass
Hoe playin pretend with your ass
Burst your bubble like a pimple, my bad
Chicken little,  throw em out the window like a demo
Camo black on black, I keep it simple
That No Genre on me, only symbol
Distracting the shit out your ass
Terms and conditions your ass
Better remember me right
If I disappear Copperfield on your ass
Now run like the pigs on your ass
And they got evidence to pin on your ass
30 years on your ass
I don't even remember your ass
Barking up the wrong tree
Beating around the wrong bush
Reading off the wrong page
Reading out the wrong book
It ain't a big deal to your ass
If it don't make no sense to your ass
I say I'm all about peace
But I'll still smack the shit out your ass

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hold on to your horses
Stay looking for an O-Z like I'm Dorothy
These niggas ain't as hard as they record us
You just a gangster on Pro Tools
You faker than O'doul's
Can't nobody here extort me
We, we ain't dating, we recordin
Pimping stiff as rigamortis
Probably from counting bands and drinking 40's

She used to get dick from Kanye West
So if you ever see her give her Kanye's best
Her man in the store tryna try his best

And I just can't seem to get that nigga broke
And I don't know how you get that nigga jokes but

And if you ever don't than get at me, at me

No one wants to fall out of heaven
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
This girl gon' hate me forever
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
No one wants to fall out of heaven

[Bridge: Bon Iver]
What are we chasing?
It feels like we're changing
(There's no proof)
Those aren’t clouds
Those are way down
Ain't no love in the playground
(Now I'm speaking truly loud)
Go away!
Chained to the bounce now
Ain't no love in the playground
(Waiting by your phone)
That's a long way

[Hook 2: The-Dream]
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
This girl gon' hate me forever
Nothing that I can do to unbreak your heart
I'm just doing my part
And I try my best not to bring it up
Just look the other way
Used to live in wonder
You were struck and now your love feels like thunder
Thunder
Thunder
Thunder

Are you ready for star time?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Life of the rich and gorgeous
Someone gonna be forging it
I told my dad I would have been aborted
If I wasn't the one that put the cord in
Pulling up in something looking foreign
Remember when a nigga couldn't afford shit
Now I get the order
Thumbing thumbing through my wallet
Automatic toilet, now that's the shit
Popping off with the orbit, I got ya' bitch
Let it go

[Chorus: Kanye West & Rick James]
Goddamn it, I need you now
Goddamn it, I need you now

Let me fix my neck, chain on
Let me fix the check, games on
Let me thump a thump game on
And ain't nobody playing with him, no
Summertime rain with him, no
They all layin' with him now
So I got the Marvin Williams with him now
No one wanna pray with him, no
Want it done, bathe in it now
Wanna get a raise with him now
Something down in nah-ney with 'em now
Like we always
Talk to me like we always

Dirt bike or a Kawasaki
Bottle up on a new party

With your praying hands
For you lil' niggas, I'm way advanced

And when I die, they build statues
You niggas ain't got the cashews
From the city where cash rules
'Till they run up on a bad mood

Bitch, get out the way
Someone gonna get out today
And I know I was gone for a minute
But need to get out today
Now let us get this money
Sell it for

Goddamn it (Don't you play no)
Don't you play with you

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
Don't play, boy
Someone 

[?] what you made, boy
Hoppin' in the mansion
Waking around with a robe on
I could have started play, boy
Cause I married a playmate

When you stay eight
And they rate

Something for when I'm in that mood
Woo

[Verse 1]
My flow is nasty like tofu
Have you sitting on clouds like a young Goku
Dope niggas locked out four year rap trotted
The sun is now gone
See dark clouds coming out
Boozy Brandy and Bacardi Beverages

[Chorus]
But something was always missing like 6Dz
I step through the stomach
Replace the baby with some looking pounds
You shouldn't look back to the past in fact just look up in the clouds
But five years from now I bet she see

[Verse 2]
Ripping holes in clouds as my altitude diminishes
How I do it thinking I'm new to this
In the clouds where I sit off another spliff
Vicious viscous clouds your flow
Victory is my impulse

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
One look at the clouds
Do you see me?
Addicted to the hobby of making rap writings

[Outro]
No dark clouds
Just silver linings

[Intro: Usher]
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Ur-sher, baby
Oh-woah-oh-oh
I'm gonna love you, yeah
Baby, oh-woah-oh-oh
Soon as I touch you there

[Verse 1: Usher]
Come and ride on me like the waves
I flip the pages 'cause I wrote the book
On the way how to sex you up, sex you up
We can do it like I'm on the stage, we'll have an audience
Baby, I'll show you the way that I sex you up
Or I can lick you up and down 'til you say
You love how I eat on that pussy
You just might go put a tat' on that pussy
That says Usher, Usher
There's no other, other (Yeah!)
Damn girl, yeah, you got that juicy
Love when I make you cum, I make it gushy
One without the other
I'm the champion lover, lover
Fuck you to sleep, wake you up again (Oh)

Girl, come and sit on my tongue again
'Cause I love to taste you, yeah
I can tell you been eating your pineapples (Mmm)

Girl, when I hit your G, you feel like you gon' pee

Huh, now where you been? It's been a year

Baby, let me love you back to sleep once more
And I know we don't speak no more (Oh)
But I just wanna tell you I'm sorry (Hey!)

Yeah, baby, don't test me (Huh), you know I'll do it
You want me to say your name, girl? Okay, Karrueche

[Chorus: Chris Brown]

No, don't you talk
Just hold on tight to me, girl
Fuck you back to sleep, girl, and rock you back

[Verse 3: ZAYN]
Baby, just stay comfortable, I want you as you are
Baby, just lay there naked waiting for me
Let's not get emotional, let's be who we are
Can we do that? Can we do that? Can we?
Know it's been a long day, it's 'bout to be a long night
So keep your eyes closed 'til I roll through
So, baby, when you're feeling like a woman in the sheets
Somebody splitting your knees, don't worry that's me
I'm over here putting work in
Baby, you ain't gotta tell me what you want

[Chorus: Chris Brown, ZAYN & Both]
Just let me rock (And let me love you, baby, ooh, oh girl)
Fuck you back to sleep, girl, oh (Yeah)
Don't say a word no, girl, don't you talk (Huh)
Just hold on tight to me, girl
Fuck you back to sleep, girl (Yeah), and rock you back (Fuck you back to sleep)

[Outro: Chris Brown & ZAYN]
Ain't sorry that I woke ya (Yeah, aw yeah), I ain't sorry 'bout ya job (Fuck you back to sleep, girl)
Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love (Rock you back, oh)
Ain't sorry that I woke ya (Yeah), I ain't sorry 'bout ya job (Fuck you back to sleep, girl, yeah)
Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love
Right back, rock you back
Right back, rock you back

[Verse 1]
Where the hell did soul go?
I am not the logo
Been here too long and I'm going home
Airplane mode, better hold the phone, better hold the phone
I woke up this morning, I looked in the mirror
Cold feet on the tile, how the hell am I here?
Lost track of the moment, barely remember the year
Is this a higher calling or just a career?
Oh god, I'm lost, my bad, my fault
And "I'm sorry" doesn't cover all the pain that I've caused
Just wanna love myself, not codependent on applause
Just wanna run myself, not codependent on applause

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to work, nah
I just wanna play
I just wanna stay in bed
And watch life through the shades
Through the shade
I just wanna feel better, feel better
And I don't wanna wait, no
I just wanna be happy, man
Man, I'll open up the shades
Open up the shades, open up the shades

[Verse 2]
I wish that taro cards would tell me my future
They say faith is good only if you use it
My uncle's kidneys failed when he got out the hospital
But he stayed drunkaholic, he just couldn't get off that bottle
Couldn't get off that bottle
I went to the casino, swore I ain't going back
The next day, went to the ATM and bet it on black
I spun the roulette wheel and I felt it all start to crash
Playing cards with the Devil, we all know the dealer wins that
I got too much bad karma, yeah, I shoulda saved up
Got kicked off that ladder I was finally getting praise from
A chance to see how we react when God decides to break us
Once you pick the pieces up, well then it's time to make something
I wanna get high, just wanna stay up
Chipped my teeth on the curb
Fight, fuck and make up
Wanna escape my mind, these thoughts need vacations
And girl, you look good, but you'd look better in Jamaica

[Chorus]
I don't wanna go to work, nah
I just wanna play
I just wanna stay in bed
And watch life through the shades
Through the shade
I just wanna feel better, feel better
And I don't wanna wait, no
I just wanna be happy, man
Man, I'll open up the shades
Open up the shades, open up the shades

[Intro: Taio Cruz]
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]
Now I know how to get down on the floor (Floor)
Experienced in moves you can't ignore ('Nore)
But something 'bout this beat that's got me hooked (Hooked)
Come over here and take a closer look (Look)

[Pre-Chorus: Kylie Minogue & Taio Cruz, (Travie McCoy)]
'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground
Whoa, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now (Ha, ha, let's go)

[Chorus: Kylie Minogue]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

[Post-Chorus: Taio Cruz]
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2: Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]

I got this high without takin' a pill (Pill)
This groove has got me way over the sun (Sun)
I'm dancin' like I am the only one (One)

[Pre-Chorus: Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]
'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground
Whoa, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now

[Chorus: Kylie Minogue & (Travie McCoy)]
It's taking me higher, higher (Yeah)
Higher off the ground (Let's go)
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

[Post-Chorus: Taio Cruz]
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh

[Verse 3: Travie McCoy]
I got my feet in the air and my head on the ground
And the rest of my body somewhere in the clouds
I'm coming down no time soon
Like I'm tied to a couple hundred helium balloons
Looks like I'ma be up for a minute (Uh-huh)
Such a beautiful feeling, 'idn't it?
Yup, when your body is so plateau
On a level that just feels so infinite

[Bridge: Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]
The music's got me going higher
I feel like I can touch the sky

[Chorus: Taio Cruz & Kylie Minogue]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

[Post-Chorus: Taio Cruz]
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh

[Outro: Travie McCoy & (Taio Cruz)]
It's your boy Travie McCoy
(Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh)
(Woo-ooh-ooh, woo-ooh-ooh)

Hello my only one
You keep on

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
As I lay me down to sleep
I hear her speak to me
Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you
So I can say

[Hook: Kanye West]
Hello, my only one, just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say
Hey hey one day, you'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

[Hook: Kanye West]
Hello my only one, remember who you are
You got the world cause you got love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day you'll understand

[Bridge: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
So hear me out, hear me out
I won't go, I won't go
No goodbyes, no goodbyes
Just hello, just hello
And when you cry, I will cry
And when you smile, I will smile
And next time when I look in your eyes
We'll have wings and we'll fly

[Hook]
Hello my only one, just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
And you're still my chosen one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

[Intro: Rihanna & Kanye West]
Man I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
Swizz told me let the beat rock

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Swizz Beatz]
For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous (God damn)
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (God damn)
They mad they're still nameless (Talk that talk, man)
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous (God damn)
Yeah we still hood famous

[Hook: Rihanna]
I just wanted you to know
I loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
Maybach Music

[Verse 2: Rick Ross & Rihanna]
The furnace, fires, fortunes, and the fumes
The aura arrogance is been known to fill the room
Boom, little nigga who are you?
Roc-A-Fella Records on record to kill a crew
Vegas in my palms a don like the 

[?]
Only one with beat taste from Kanye on my momma stew
For the ye I've been known to be Karmaloop
Malcom X in his head say my name and here come to troops
Hands out my pocket I cock it and let it loose
And Dame was spilling Armadale on a nigga boots
Martin Luther King's real estate was a dream
Farrakhan's farm was one that I once seen
The final call dogs stay on your dean
Fragrances Agent Provocateur stay on my queen
Mind your business the killers can intervene
I'm half naked in the GQ magazine (Know)
Tours looking like its wrestlemania
I'm The Rock setting fires to the stadium
Burn it down then I'm off to anther beat
Might get engages to a freak just for a couple weeks
Something I can't afford
If you not a playboy that's something I can't endorse
Win, lose, or draw William living like he Biggie Smalls
Balling its tax season I was born to be a boss
See that your face froze
Bobby Brown lockjaw, Whitney Houston in the ghost
Coogie and Cartier causalities of the fame
Your bitch MCM she even tagging my name

[Bridge: Sister Nancy & Swizz Beatz]

Let's have a girls' night out tonight
(Alright, alright, alright)
It's a girls' night out
Let's have a girls' night out tonight
I can't wait to live it up tonight
It's a girls' night out
Let's have a girls' night out tonight
It's a girls' night out
So throw your hands up if you feel alright
I can't wait to live it up tonight
It's a girls' night out
No boys, no boys
No boys, no boys
No boys, no boys
It's a girls' night out, it's a girls' night out
No boys, no boys
No boys, no boys
No boys, no boys
It's a girls' night out, it's a girls' night out

[Chorus]
Symbols of injustice and hatred
Confederate flag (bring it down)
Symbols of human enslavement
Confederate flag (bring it down)
But what about the red, white and the blue
American flag (bring it down)
Racists flew that flag when they captured you
American flag

[Verse 1]
I ain't here for selling shit
Me I came for telling it
I tell it like it is
So my people stay intelligent
We ending it
Racism, slavery, we ending it
This is why we bringing down the flag of the confederate
I share the same sentiment: Slavery is bad
But slavery was established by the american flag
Follow me
The american flag it flew in every colony
To break down the confederate only ia a hypocrisy
You bringing down one flag to raise up another
When both flags ensalved my sisters and my brothers
Yea man there were others
African, french, the portuguese
The english, the spanish, enslavers for all of these
So why raise any flag that killed my mom and my dad
Invaded my lands with plans to take up all that they had
I'm glad, the confederate flag is banned today
But the American flag is still flown by the KKK

[Chorus]
Symbols of injustice and hatred
Confederate flag (you gots to bring it down)
Symbols of human enslavement
Confederate flag (you gots to bring it down)
But what about the red, white and the blue
American flag (you gots to bring it down)
Racists flew that flag when they captured you
American flag

[Verse 2]
KRS, the right teacha
In the street I might see ya
Under the American flag blacks had no rights either
Women had no rights either, natives had no rights either
White abolitionist had to fight against white preacher
Red, white and blue should mean red, white and black
Blue was our indigo color, coming from way back
But the system is racist, when the murderers are acquitted
So we ride in the streets, then you say we shouldn't have did it
"they destroying their cty", man you don't get it
If this was my city I wouldn't be getting shot in it
Stopped in it, harressed, unemployed and always locked in it
While the guns, the polution and drugs are always trapped in it
Turn the tv off man, don't listen to all that
You a global citizen, you got to know all the facts
You a global citizen, you got to know how to act
Ask yourself, what does the American flag mean to Iraq?

And if the popo pull me over probably need a paralegal

[Chorus]
Tell me what you wanna do, what you wanna do?
I got killers the rooftop, all on the rooftop
Who you wanna shoot, but I don't wanna go back
You don't wanna do that, why you gotta prove that?
What you gotta prove, these niggas better move back
Shoes come in two stacks, Imma take a few back
What you wanna do, I'm choking off that fruit pack
Riding with the roof back, crazy color coupe
Homie what you wanna do?

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Sippin' absolut (eghh)
Im walkin' from the car lot straight to the booth
So my swagger through the roof
I got money too
This what money do
My shoes came from the zoo
My cane came from peru
My car painted piru
Piss body say suwu
My earrings candy blue
We walk in different hues
See me on the news
My lawyer is a jew
In case you wanna sue
I got a lot of scoons
The beef ain't nothing new
I pull up in a coupe
Same color as a soup
And I ain't got on a suit
I just look fountain blue
My room right by the pool
I said look at the view

[Chorus]
Tell me what you wanna do, what you wanna do?
I got killers the rooftop, all on the rooftop
Who you wanna shoot, but I don't wanna go back
You don't wanna do that, why you gotta prove that?
What you gotta prove, these niggas better move back
Shoes come in two stacks, I'mma take a few back
What you wanna do, I'm choking off that fruit pack
Riding with the roof back, crazy color coupe
Homie what you wanna do?

[Verse]
Them bitch detergent riding dirty is you nervous
Conduct yourself with class when i'm in session dont disturb me
Describable, just like a circus, you're unreliable
I want the cash, the car , the girls, all things i'm entitled to
My white brand make them rich white girls back bend
Ass backwards like paying taxes on a back end
Gucci mane airtran how i fly the hoes in
Wouldn't be my cut friend till i put my golds in
Now Ive crossed the globe boy mean stick my nose in
Ten thousand diamonded out loafers stick my toes in
Fresh squad post man the books are closed
They might not re-open cause you niggas is hoes

[Chorus]
Tell me what you wanna do, what you wanna do?
I got killers the rooftop, all on the rooftop
Who you wanna shoot, but I don't wanna go back
You don't wanna do that, why you gotta prove that?
What you gotta prove, these niggas better move back
Shoes come in two stacks, Imma take a few back
What you wanna do, I'm choking off that fruit pack
Riding with the roof back, crazy color coupe
Homie what you wanna do?

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I unluckily was born in proverty

Plus, I was 17 I had a fuckin' m16
I'm in to deep by june 15th I had like 100 p's

Nothing better than a Franklin'
Junior lean bank account stretching like rubber beans
Rubber bands till some crazy rims are sipping fam
Right here in this city this vacinity
Don't pitty me pity the fool cause I'm like mr t
I gots to be with 2 or 3 diamond rings on at least
Diamond chain 200 a piece it's so hard to beat it
Not hard to see me she can see me she ain't blind at all
She said that you were too career man you to industry
She likes me cause I'm in the streets, she's an amazing freak

[Chorus: Gucci Mane ]

[Gucci Mane]
Yes! opposites attract

Business stay up out my business
Said it like I lived it
Said it like I ment it
Niggas think I end it
But I just begined it
What you want a carpet
I am not a doormat
I fuck you on the carpet
I ain't one to turn back
You look like a tender
Bet you like 22
Ain't no more than 24
Add a few loose a few
What you want to eat for dinner it don't even matter
What you want some snow crabs
I fly you to alaska
Yo-you should be my tender
This shit might end in bloodbath

[Chorus: Gucci Mane ]
Cleopatra
She need a nigga with a fast car

[Intro]
Ooh woah

[Verse 1]
Tired of the conversations, questions 'bout me
Every time I leave the house, when I'm in or when I'm out
Girlfriend say I treat you foul but I don't know
At the end of the day, you know yourself
And I'm tired of the times when you run your mouth
Time's only running out, baby, you made me take a vow
Stop your whining, and sum it up, what are we now?
At the end of the day, you know yourself
Can't hear when you're talking loud
Oh, you do the most, this shit's getting old, we both said enough
Went through this more than once, but my GPS broke
Don't know where to go

[Chorus]
Every time I'm lost and found
Yeah, this is not the lost and found
Whose time are you wasting now?
'Cause every time I'm lost and found, yeah
Oh, tell me who's losing out
'Cause you say it's the end and playing games again, I found (I found)
Playing games again, I found, yeah
Playing games again, I found yeah

[Verse 2]
Baby, you were the one that I could trust the most, used to think you were beautiful
'Til you would drink too many toasts, what would your mama say if
Girl, you're drunk out your mind, oh my God, get to praying
Taking bread with the wine, rude awakening
Lord don't save her, she think she a big girl
Think she gon' draft all the players, think she gon' be ballin' yeah
But no, no, no, no, I done worked too hard for these cars and this cash no, no, no, no
Selling your soul, might as well be selling your ass, no, no, no, stop kidding, girl, you know yourself

[Chorus]
Every time I'm lost and found
Yeah, this is not the lost and found
Whose time are you wasting now?
'Cause every time I'm lost and found, yeah
Oh, tell me who's losing out
'Cause you say it's the end and playing games again, I found

[Verse 3]
I don't know why you keep fuckin' with niggas
That really don't be in the streets
Always actin' hard like they murderers
Tell them niggas just run into me
This ain't the lost and found, girl, you're out of bounds
It take a lot of money to make her booty bounce
If you takin' shots, better make it count
And girl, don't do nothing for free
I see that shawty want that money bad
She fuckin' all over the internet
Dollars, where the money at?
Fuck around and run it up for a sack
Stealin' weed up out my duffle bag
Only the, birds, take the whole bag
Baby girl, don't try and go there
You already know that

[Chorus]
Every time I'm lost and found, yeah (oh, oh, oh, every time)
This is not the lost and found (yeah)
Whose time are you wasting now? (Whose time are you wasting now?)
'Cause every time I'm lost and found ('cause every time I'm lost and found)
Oh, up and down, back and fourth, all around
Oh, tell me who's really losing out, yeah (tell me who's really losing out)
'Cause you say it's the end and playing games again, I found

[Verse 1]
There's too many omens
That I didn't 

[?]
They helped me through the wire
And they pull at the teeth

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And they tell me that they own me
That they hold me, but they never control me

[Chorus]
Life
No one can take the life
My reverie
The tide has done the worst they can to me
For now I'll dry my eyes
While my heart, all filled with bloody oceans
I'll strive
The moment no one noticed me

[Verse 2]
I'm known to be ferocious
Towards my enemy
Though gentle in the heart
I'll beat what I've seen

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And the thunder, it keeps rolling
But I'll stay all the way 'til the closing

[Chorus]
Life
No one can take the life
My reverie
The tide has done the worst they can to me
For now I'll dry my eyes
While my heart, all filled with bloody oceans
I'll strive
The moment no one noticed me
Life
No one can take the life
My reverie
The tide has done the worst they can to me
For now I'll dry my eyes
While my heart, all filled with bloody oceans
But I'll strive
The moment no one noticed me

[Verse 1]
Evade my intellect
Feed into my introspect
Wrap your words around my brain
Driving me insane, yeah, ooh
You found the real me
Save my inner being
Switch on me like seasons
Do I need to give you a reason?

[Chorus]
There's millions of reasons to love you (Love you)
There's millions of reasons (Reasons, ooh)
You give me a reason to want you (Want you)
You give me a reason
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Reason)
Yeah (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
I know you're tired of inconsistency
Are you into me? Are you feeling me?
To be honest
I'm into you, and the way that you talk is so damn cool
With your love I'm on a different high I've never felt before
And if your love is a drug, I'm an addict 'cause, damn, I'm feening for more, yeah
We've been talking for a minute now
Let me know where your heads at, am I in it? Yeah
You put me on your super high
I want to get lost in your paradise

[Chorus]
There's millions of reasons to love you (Love you)
There's millions of reasons (Reasons, ooh, ooh, ooh)
You give me a reason to want you (Want you)
You give me a reason (Yeah, yeah, ooh)
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Ooh, reason, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Lucid dream, in reality
I'm just tryna feel your gravity
Always fallin in love, and I'm tired of the cycle
We don't even need a title
You're always on my mind
It's funny how I'm thinking about you all the damn time
You don't got to be mine, just be mine for the night
I don't know what this is but it feels just right
I wanna make a move
Let me know if that sounds cool, yeah
All the things I'd do
All the things I'd do for you

[Chorus]
There's millions of reasons to love you (Love you)
There's millions of reasons (There's millions of reasons, ooh)
You give me a reason to want you (Want you)
You give me a reason (Reason, ooh, ooh)
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Give me a reason)
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (You give me a reason)

Pull up, pull out the tangerine dreams
Step out of that limousine
We walk in, and we flossy
Your B keep it bink, and we bossy
Hey, it's like I told you, song number one

[Pre-Chorus]
Take the crown, shut it down, 'bout to steal the show
Shooting star, I'm a boss, Marilyn Monroe

Take the crown, shut it down, 'bout to steal the show
Shooting star, I'm a boss, Marilyn Monroe

Wishful thinking
I never make amends
But we could be good friends
Yeah could we be good friends
We could be good friends

So be my girl

Go and ask your friend
They'll tell you who I am
Who you talking to
Baby I need you
In my world
In my world

[Intro: Kanye West]
Yeah-yeah, 9:08 L.A. time
Back in the lab and shit

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My wife said, I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with no permission, on our own conditions
Most blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Yeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout, "How my neck look?"
Well, it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people (Real!)
I've been woken from enlightened man's dream
Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego when confidence was my last resort
I know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern-day MJ, with a off-the-wall flow

[Bridge: Sampha]
Nightlife, walk all over me
Walk all over me
I'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent that you'll bring
Fly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)

[Verse 3: Sampha]
Please face me when I speak
Please say to me somethin' before you leave
You've been treatin' me like I'm invisible, now I'm visible to you
Oh, the invisible truth stay sober
I can't quite understand the games you play
Understand, understand, understand I'm standin' under oath
And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore
But I'm cryin' at the bar
I'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man
I'm wishin' that you came down here and stood by me
And looked at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above

[Chorus: Sampha]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Oh bring me my shotgun, bring me back some shells
Why don't you just bring me my shotgun
Bring me back a pocket full of shells
Well you know if I don't get myself a little competition
You know there's gonna be some trouble 'round here

Well you know my mama told me, she said
You gonna have bad luck, son, don't care where you go
So why don't you bring me my shotgun

Early in the morning when the sun gonna rise
She lets her rolling go moonshine bright
In the morning bring me my shotgun
Well I can stand in the mist for a while
But I can't stand it for very long

Look out cause here comes some free advice

Walk in the sunshine, watch for the bright sun
Be all those things you're able to be

You got to listen to the heavens, you got to try to understand
The grateness of their movement is just as small as it is grand

Try not to hurry, it's just not your worry
Leave it to those all caught up in time

You got to deep-six your wristwatch, you got to try and understand
The time it seems to capture is just the movement of its hands

I ain't preachin', 'cause I don't know
How to make fast things move along slow
I can't stop it, can't make it go

Just 'cause I say it, that don't mean that it's so, no, no
Watch what you hear now, make sure it's clear now
Just 'cause it's said that don't mean that it's true. So all we say:
You got to make a revolution, you got to help me with my cause
You got to burn down all the buildings, you got to throw out all the laws

I ain't burning, Lord, I'm still only learning
How to become a man of my own

Just want to find out what's right and what's wrong

I ain't crazy, all the world keeps on turning
I'm still trying to find out what's right and what's wrong

I ain't crazy!
Has anybody ever heard of Bob Ezrin???

What the fuck does he know about rap…

I’m tired of old people that have no connection with anything trying to comment on music!

Do something relevant… Please don’t speak on me bro ever again!!!

Your kids are ashamed of their dad…  Sorry for speaking about kids…  but could you imagine if you were Bob Ezrin’s kids…

I’m so sorry for them…   I will send them free Yeezys to make up for the embarrassment that you have caused your family!

Bro you said Macklemore was more important musically than me… no offense to Macklemore, he’s a nice human being!

Bob please never speak in public again… you are everything that is wrong with the old guard …

It’s guys like you that run companies and don’t invest in Ye even if I’m your kid’s idol!!!

Rock and Roll was stolen… Rap was exploited…

I made Dark Fantasy and Watch the Throne in one year and wasn’t nominated for either and you know who has 2 albums of the year
Welcome to pop culture!!!

Ezrin I truly feel sorry for your friends and family that they have had to suffer an idiot like you for so many years…

God bless the fools … all positive vibes!

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Tonight, we're in paradise
Soarin' through the sky
Seein' pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right
We're in paradise
Soarin' through the sky
Seein' pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
Sparks burning in my heart
You guide me through the dark
I look at you, you feel it too
Hands, touching palm-to-palm
Connection feeling strong
We're wild and free, and I believe

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Tonight, we're in paradise
Soarin' through the sky
Seein' pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right
We're in paradise
Soarin' through the sky
Seein' pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right

[Drop: Charli XCX]
Yeah, we can make it right
Yeah, we can make it right
Yeah, we can make it right

[Verse 2: Hannah Diamond]
Home, I found it in your eyes
You give me butterflies
And when we touch, I feel the rush
Sweet, just like a cherry drop
So please don't let it stop
In love with you, we're stuck like glue

[Chorus: Charli XCX & Hannah Diamond]
Tonight, we're in paradise
Soarin' through the sky
Seein' pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right

[Drop: Charli XCX & Hannah Diamond]
We're in paradise
Soarin' through the sky
Seein' pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right
Tonight, we're in paradise
Soarin' through the sky
Seein' pink and white
Yeah, we can make it right

[Outro: Charli XCX]
Runnin' away and surfin' on starlight
Rainbows and waterfalls in my dreams
Dancin' with you on top of the mountain
(Yeah, we can make it right)
Kissin' your lips and feeling electric
Fantasy blurrin' purple and green
Dancin' with you on top of the mountain
(Yeah, we can make it right)
I would like to sit down with Neil Portnow right now

I think the Grammys are super important!!!

I know so many cool artists whose hearts have been broken by the politics including mine

We need to fix this

I don't give opinions because they are commonly agreed upon. I say what I feel

I feel the Grammy awarding system is way off and completely out of touch

Hi Grammys this is the most important living artist talking

If I'm not at the show next year then there is no show

I don't want to just fix the awards for me but I want to fix it for Dexter Navy who directed A$AP Rocky’s LSD video

Everybody with any form of taste knows that was the best video of the year!

Dexter didn't feel he even had a chance of winning and he was right!!!
You guys are supposed to be all about taste

You like your black people a certain way also. You wouldn't have Future perform and that man owned the clubs last summer

Has anyone at the Grammys ever heard March Madness??? Yes I have a problem with the Grammys

All artists have a problem with it and I am going to fix it for us all starting right now

Neil please reach out as soon as possible so we can make the Grammys culturally relevant again

Us real music guys wanna have fun too

And always remember that rock and roll was stolen and don't try to hide behind Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis 😭😭😭 all positive vibes

First order of business. We the people need to see Future at the Grammys

We need to see Young Thug at the Grammys.  Not just me and Jay in a suit

People ask why I speak in a public forum... Well my voice is my power. Freedom of speech. Freedom of opinion. Freedom of dreams

I'm not crazy I'm free

No slave mindset no more. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free

I wrote Saint Pablo after admitting to my greatest shame my personal debt. But I'm not ashamed anymore
I'm proud as an entrepreneur that I gave everything I had to my dreams

I'm happy and free and proud and confident. I'm not crazy. I'm free

Free from being held back by public opinion

It's a beautiful time.  I love my friends. I love my family.  I love people. The human race

You guys will see my heart. You guys will feel my heart. We will make a difference

I just had to start with shoes so that I could be economically empowered enough to have a voice

What is your definition of true freedom? There is no true freedom without economic freedom

Respect to everyone working hard to keep a roof over their kids

That is one of the reasons I respect the paps so much

And yes I've talked to Adidas and we gon hook y'all up with free Yeezys and Adidas.  All positive vibes

I'm not even gon lie to you. I love me so much right now

New album coming this summer

I love being a voice of freedom when so many people are scared to speak up
The world needs a guy like me. The world needs somebody to not be scared and tell his truth

You won't always agree with me but I'm gon always be me. I'm woke!

Workin' with the work ain't talkin bout bo-flex
Fishscale flake, iced out my rolex
Call me a landlord cause this my complex
Standin' by the pot right there where it go at
3 months, still ain't bought no clothes yet
No sofa, no bed or hoe yet
Everyday all day standin' where the dope at
Talkin' to the plug like homie where the blow at
Georgia where the Sun, East Atlanta where the snow at
100 to the lawyer, ain't even been to court yet
Dope like enough ain't even hit it with the fork yet
Stove work good, but the A/C bullshit
Dread head young boys waitin' on the door kick
Six thou' Zone 6 smokin' on a good shit
Gucci Mane out and he back on some kush shit
Junkie at the door and he really dont want shit
Feds tappin' lines who you talkin' on the phone with
Still' cookin' up early 5 in the morning
Workable pay fee nigga like Shoney's
Price go up, blow up in the drought
Green comin' in soft white going out
Trapping my style ain’t never going out
Work stocked up we ain’t never runnin’ out

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
Stove music homie, don’t you confuse it
Lames gone cop it these boys gone abuse it
Niggas seen me hustle, niggas know I robbed
Niggas know I fucked with Gucci n them Bricksquad
Say I’m chopper dumb, still I’m street smart
Say I’m fool bout the money, sprayin’, retard
My chain like the yellow bus, that bitch cheesy
That boy might need some thuraflu
His ice game got him sneezin'
Soft like tissue, its expensive
Whole thang cost you 20 grand
Hot like an Audi hundred rounds let em know that I ain’t playin'
Back on my old shit, back with my old bitch
Cocaine crazy, back on my stove shit

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Part I: The Blacker The Berry]

[Verse]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listenin' sure you will agree
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, 

[bump] your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, you know that it's big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You know you're evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real higga

[Interlude]
As we proceed
To give you what you need
Trap our bodies but can't lock our minds
Everybody just stop
(The bigger I shoot)

[Hook: Assassin]
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that

[Interlude]
As we proceed
To give you what you need
Lock our body, can't trap our mind

[Part II: Alright]

[Hook]
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
We gon' be a-

[Verse 1]
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
But homicide be lookin' at you from the face down
What Mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty women and women, and it's the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows
20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Everything I know, karma comin' heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
Tell em' other gangsters silence for the record
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

[Pre-Hook]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, down before
When our pride was low
Lookin' at the world, "Where do we go?"
I'm at the preacher's door
They wanna kill us dead, at the preacher's door
We said give 'em some more
This one time, do it fo' sho
But we gon' be alright

[Hook]
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright (hello)
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright (P!)
We gon' be alright (hello)
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 2]
What you want, you a house, you a car?
Acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
You can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can smell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Diggin' in my pocket, candy paint it on the Regal
Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel
I don't talk about it, 'bout it, everyday I see
I don't talk about it, 'bout it, everyday I see
I don't talk about it, 'bout it, everyday I see
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's all
Pick back and chat, I trap the back for y'all
I rap, I'm black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with...
God

[Part III: Untitled 5]

[Verse]
It's been a week already
Feeling weak already
Got me at peak, possibility of what could be
Situation is heavy, I've got to prove
On February twenty sixth I lost my life too
It's like I'm here in a dark dream
Nightmare, hear screams recorded
Say that it sounds distorted but they know who it was
That was me yelling for help when he drowned in his blood
Why didn't he defend himself? Why couldn't he throw a punch?
And for our community do you know what this does?
Add to a trail of hatred
Twenty twelve was taped for the world to see
Set us back another four-hundred years
This is modern day slavery
The reason why I'm by your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
Every piece of your brain
'Til your son jumps into your arms
Cut off the engine then sped off in a Wraith
I'm on the dash with my bible in the trunk
Had the vodka on the top
How come I can long time
How come I could make it popular?
Puff on what I want
How come I could make it popular?
Puff on what I want
See I'm living with anxiety
Giving up sobriety
Cussing with his sister
And playing with society
Justice ain't free
Therefore justice ain't me
Try and justify staying, obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time, I go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinking to myself
Hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinking by myself
At the end of Section Park
Caught you when you walk besides your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
Every piece of your brain
'Til your son jumps into your arms
The engine then sped off in a wraith
I said Hiiipower, one time you see it
Hiiipower, two times, you see it
Hiiipower, two times, you see it
Conversation for the entire nation this is bigger than us

[Verse 1]
(Yeah)
Good girls shouldn't party
We do what we supposed to do
Speak, but never shout it
Get home, be in bed by two
But I don't wan' follow that, that no more
I see myself all over you for sure
You got me breaking all the rules
Leggo, leggo

[Chorus]
If I share my secret, secret, ah ah
Promise you'll keep it, keep it down
If I share my secret, ah ah
No one gets to know but you
No one gets to know but shh

[Drop]
Shh
Shh
Shh
Shh

[Verse 2]
(Ah ha ha, mmm)
Please don't tell nobody
I'm ready to climb the walls
I know that you want it
I'm ready to give it all
I feel like an animal on all fours
I see myself all over you for sure
You got me breaking all the rules
Leggo, leggo

[Chorus]
If I share my secret, secret, ah ah
Promise you'll keep it, keep it down
If I share my secret, ah ah
No one gets to know but you
No one gets to know but shh

[Drop]
Shh
Shh
Shh
Shh

[Bridge]
Under the glimmering lights, my secret's out
Now I got nothing to hide, come tear me down
Shimmering all through the night, I'm tempted by you
It's all true, oh

[Breakdown]
No-no-no-no-no one gets to know but you
No-no-no-no-no one gets to know but
Know but you, you, you, you
No one gets to know but you
No-no-no-no-no one gets to know but shh

[Drop]

[Chorus]
If I share my secret, secret, ah ah
Promise you'll keep it, keep it down
If I share my secret, ah ah
No one gets to know but you
No one gets to know but shh

I challenge you to a dance off
Hands off, no trash talk, no back walk
On the black top, just me, you, that's all
No cat calls, no tag teams, no mascots
Right now, dance off
Get on the floor
Get on the, get on the floor, go
Get on the floor, do it
Come on and get on the floor, go

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I grab my ankle and pull it up
And do that thing where I move my butt
I got the juice, motherfucker, don't use it up
I say, woo, there it is, then loosen my tux
Then I shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, to the left
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, to the right
Gimme, gimme, gimme, everything that you got
Dance off, motherfucker, do the damn thing right

[Interlude 1: Macklemore]
She got loose elbows and a big ol' neck
I like a big boned girl who could work up a sweat
I rock shelltoes and a turtleneck
She just wanna talk, I said, "I ain't TED"
Dance off

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Your grandma, that's a bad mama jama
She doing the banana, grabbing my trunk like a hammock
Mmm, she like the funk, god dammit, she can handle it
She tugging my dick, I'm feeling a little bit inadequate
(Dance off)
Your grandpa got a cock like a ham hock
Hella old, hella long, looking like Matlock
Damn, dog, I don't even wanna have a standoff
He drunk talkin' 'bout he 'bout to take his pants off
(Dance off)
The hater with the macarena
I can Roger Rabbit in my office space
If you watch my pace, looks like I'm concentrated
Or I'm constipated when I walk this way

[Hook: Idris Elba]
I challenge you to a dance off
Hands off, no trash talk, no back walk
On the black top, just me, you, that's all
No cat calls, no tag teams, no mascots

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
I sneak up behind you like a panther
Who ordered the private dancer?
Can I get an amen from the pastor?
Pulled the ol' "Do you want a back rub?"
You must hurt like Grey Poupon
Swag on tap like Savion
Jump on the tablecloth, fake a fall
Pretend to break my arm then I'm breaking you off
But please don't tell my baby’s mama
I wanna dance all night 'til the break of dawn
I wanna sweat, sweat, sweat, 'til your make-up's gone
Baby girl, you looking like a champion

[Interlude 2: Macklemore]
Hey you, you there, get up out of your chair
Paid twenty bucks to get up in this club, put your cellphone down, you square
I be going in, I can't help it, I got bruises on my pelvis
Ladies, fellas, don't drunk dial your exes
Hello, bouncer, I have a job for you
While I'm dancing, watch my shoes
Tonight is the night that we rendezvous
Sweat the fountain of youth, bust a move
Fringe jacket, pants of leather
Tanktop, spandex and pleather
Been a stressful week, I got a lot of pressure
You have a lot of great moves but mine are better

[Hook: Idris Elba]
I challenge you to a dance off
Hands off, no trash talk, no back walk
On the black top, just me, you, that's all
No cat calls, no tag teams, no mascots
Right now, dance off (Dance off)

Oh Lord, I can't sit down
Better hold my phone, I'm going for the crown, good God
But I'm confident this is my town
Better hope my feet don't fail me now, good God

Slick shit man, that's all we do
Hold up, little homie, let me talk my truth
Made an Instagram for my cat and my cat doesn't even rap
And got more followers than you
Hold up
Let me get my cat a bar, she's filthy
Hey Cairo come here, baby (Meow)
Now my cat's more famous than you ever will be
I been hustling
You can't tell me nothing

But when you're drunk at the wedding, still gon' fuck him

You're embarrassed, huh?
I'm in Paris, bruh
You brought your whole crew
I'm with my parents, bruh
Every white dude in America went to the barber shop
"Give me the Macklemore haircut"
Australia, they heard of me
Germany, they heard of me
Japan, they heard of me
It's a murder scene, you gon' learn some things
My dick named Ron Burgundy
I'm bad news with a pan flute
In a plaid suit, no can do
No, uh uh, I don't work for free
I used to smoke that purple weed
Sip a bunch of purple drink
That shit did not work for me
And now I just sip herbal tea
I'm posted at the swapmeet in a robe eating Church's wings
So cold, so cold, no emergen-C

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Did it by myself, not a little bit of help
Nobody, nobody did nothing, I knelt
On my knees, said "God, please give me a deal"
And God texted me back
"Don't be dumb, young man, gotta do it yourself"
It's up to you to turn the pen into a machete
And make sure that every beat that you meet gets killed
I treat the beat just like a pussy
And I eat it up and beat it up and leave it fucked
So you cannot compete with us
I'm weaving in and out of traffic
In the Cadillac, oh wait, is that us on the radio?
Wait, is that us on the radio?
It's what I always dreamed of
Back when I had peach fuzz
Shoutout to the homie D
Who's D? Deez nuts
I'm eating chicken wings and onions rings
If you're wondering, yes, I does my thing
And another thing, no puppet strings
On the company, we sucker free
I ain't trippin' on what the public think
Ten thousand, we hustling
This shit didn't happen overnight
This shit didn't happen suddenly

[Hook: Xperience]
When you see me in the club
Brad Pitt, that's my cousin
Angelina show me love
Brad Pitt, that's my cousin
You got me fucked up
Brad Pitt, that's my cousin
Like you don't know what's up
Brad Pitt, Brad, Pitt

It's NFL vs. M.I.A. right now
One, they're suing you for damaging their fantastic reputation by flipping the bird
The other part, they wanted to reserve the right to sue you later to make you pay for any damages ahead
If they come after you, they can only come after you for half of your income over five-hundred thousand dollars per year or all of your income over five million dollars per year
So far, it's confidential, nobody in the world knows about this

[Verse 1]
Brown girl, brown girl, turn your shit down
You know America don't wanna hear your sound
Boom-boom, drop the music, go back to India
With your crazy shit, you're bombing up the area
Looking through your Instagram, looking for a pentagram
All I see is poor people, they should be on Ghetto-gram
You don't get our underground, brofist or overground
Fist pump, eat ham, or even throw your dick around
Yeah, you try to stick around, do you do Bikram?
Let you into Super Bowl, you tried to steal Madonna's crown
What the fuck you on about? Think about goin to France
Quelle heure est-il? This ain't time for your terror dance
Eat, pray, love, spend time in the Ashram
Or I'll drone you, Kony 2012 you, now scram!

American tech outsourced to my city
Made by a hippie, yeah, it's fuckin' trippy
Beatles in the '60s, Timbaland and Missy
Software, underwear, bootlegs in my factory
Hands so rough but nimble like a pixy
Travel like a gypsy, made it so chicksy
This is how we made it to American history
It's not written but we print it in our country
Billions of brown people staying unlisted
Yeah, we get on Twitter and we would just crash it
Jesus went to India, Steve Jobs went to India
Now when you see me you say, "What the fuck's a bindi, ya?"

We chill on 'em, pill on 'em, this is drugs for the pain
We check on it, cook on it, bustin' bustin' insane
Roll on it, roll on it, suckas been in the game
Killing 'em, billing 'em, and we still in the game
We chill on 'em, pill on 'em, this is drugs for the pain
We check on it, cook on it, bustin' bustin' insane
Roll on it, roll on it, suckas been in the game

[Outro]
People see me as trouble, see me, see me as trouble

People see me as trouble, see me, see me as trouble

Cause I got a reputation, got a, got a reputation
And I got a reputation, got a, got a reputation

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Every single night I like to fuck on the thotty
Ice on my wrist like a nigga play hockey
I'm ballin on these niggas, that's why all these hoes jock me
I just want to spend every dollar at Follies
I said I just want to spend every dollar at Follies
Every single night I like to fuck on the thotty
Ice on my wrist like a nigga play hockey
I just want to spend every dollar at Follies

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I said I just bought a coat and It's made by Cavalli
Fuckin' on my bitch and you know she a hottie
I just bought a new whip and it go fast like a Harley
Chopper get to singin' and it sound like Charlie
Yeah, yeah, Uncle Charlie, yeah, mmm
We gon' guard me, I'm at Folly, fuckin' up the party
I got white on my black like a piano key
Yachty from the block, don't give a fuck 'bout what you say to me
I just fuck a bitch, I got the recipe, aye
Stack up just to flex up, I'ma spend it all at Follies

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Every single night I like to fuck on the thotty
Ice on my wrist like a nigga play hockey

I just want to spend every dollar at Follies
I said I just want to spend every dollar at Follies
Every single night I like to fuck on the thotty
Ice on my wrist like a nigga play hockey
I just want to spend every dollar at Follies

[Verse 2: Pollàri]
I just, I just, I just went and copped a Rari just like the Rover
I don't wanna drive it, but I need me a chauffer
If you talkin' wrong, I'm already gone and grabbin' the holster
He gon' miss his soul as long his ass on the posters
I been gettin' money, that's the only thing I do
I just took a trip bought a bitch in Ohio
I been gettin' money, that's the only thing I do
I just took a trip bought a bitch in Ohio

[Hook: Lil Yachty]
Every single night I like to fuck on the thotty

I'm ballin on these niggas, that's why all these hoes jock me
I just want to spend every dollar at Follies
I said I just want to spend every dollar at Follies
Every single night I like to fuck on the thotty
Ice on my wrist like a nigga play hockey
I just want to spend every dollar at Follies

[Verse 1]
The first day we met, I was seventeen
The sky was shining bright
And the grass was green
You had your hair up
A smile on your face
I’ll never forget that day
You walked up to me
And asked for a ride
I had a buddy in the front
So I pushed him aside
Put your seatbelt on
Throw your feet on the dash
Said, "Boy, please try not to crash"
Then I winked back
Said, "Baby, don’t you trust me?"

[Chorus]
Then I hit the gas
I just want to go fast
I want this feeling to last
So I hit the gas
If you want to go back
Baby, it’s too late for that
I hit the gas

[Verse 2]
We pulled in about ten past twelve
I dropped you off, your daddy gave me hell
You threw your hands up, gave me a grin
You jumped back in and said, "Let's do it again"

[Chorus]
Then I hit the gas
I just want to go fast
I want this feeling to last
So I hit the gas
If you want to go back
Baby, it’s too late for that
I hit the gas

[Bridge]
I know you’re just a small town girl
So just give me the chance
And I’ll show you the world
So come on baby

[Chorus]
Then I hit the gas
I just want to go fast
I want this feeling to last
So I hit the gas
If you want to go back
Baby, it’s too late for that
I hit the gas

[Verse 1]
She throws her Braves cap on her head
Every time it rains
And when her favorite song comes on
She sings out of key as it plays
Always leaving the car on empty
And blaming me for what she did
But when we talk about our future
Or the name of our first kid

[Chorus]
It’s kind of crazy what turns me on
How she’s always blowing up my phone
It’s not some cover girl on a magazine
It’s the one I fell in love with at 17
An addictive drug that pulled me in
Not them long tan legs or perfect ten
It’s the imperfections that she wants gone
It’s kinda crazy what turns me on

[Verse 2]
I love to give her silent treatment
When she throws her little fits
Thinking she’s gonna get her way
As she pokes out her bottom lip
When she makes her funny faces
And does her best British accent
When she says she’s not hungry
And then I get mine and she digs in

[Chorus]
It’s kind of crazy what turns me on
How she's always blowing up my phone
It’s not some cover girl on a magazine
It’s the one I fell in love with at 17
An addictive drug that pulled me in
Not them long tan legs or perfect ten
It’s the imperfections that she wants gone
It’s kinda crazy what turns me on

[Outro]
It turns me on
An addictive drug that pulled me in
Not them long tan legs or perfect ten
It’s the imperfections that she wants gone
It’s kinda crazy but turns me on
Yeah eh yeah
Oh it turns me on
Yeah it turns me on

[Verse 1:]
There’s no doubt it was always you
From that first time I walked you home from school
Until you stole my heart underneath that August moon
It was always you… it was always you
Now it hurts to see your pretty smile fade
I’ve got a front row seat to watch you drift away
And I know there’s nothing left for us to say
But it’s okay… it’s okay

[Chorus:]
There’s no getting over you
I tried to sugarcoat the truth
But the missing you is tearing me apart
Every kiss that I let slip away
Every minute every single day
The memories make it easy to break a heart
But forgetting… forgetting is the hardest part

[Verse 2:]
Sometimes I sit here feeling like a ghost
Its that emptiness I think that hurts the most
But a piece of me still holds a little hope
I should just let go… but I can’t let go

[Chorus]
There’s no getting over you
I tried to sugarcoat the truth
But the missing you is tearing me apart
Every kiss that I let slip away
Every minute every single day
The memories make it easy to break a heart
But forgetting… forgetting is the hardest part

[Verse 3:]
It’s time to pull myself together
And put these pieces back wherever
Maybe one day I’ll find love again… again

[Chorus]
There’s no getting over you
I've tried to sugarcoat the truth
A million times but I'm still torn apart
Every kiss that I let slip away
Every minute every single day
The memories make it easy to break a heart
But forgetting… forgetting is the hardest part

[Verse 1]
Driving down on back roads
Skipping down on traffic
Flipping through the radio
All I get is static
I don’t mind the quiet
I guess I kind of like it
Better nothing at all
Than the sound of us crying

[Chorus]
You said you didn’t mean it
But it's still in my head
I learned it’s no easier
To forgive and forget
We thought it was forever
Look at us now
Well I tried
And I lost more than I found

[Verse 2]
Sitting by the window waiting for your headlights
Been two damn days since you said goodbye
I was feeling lonely, feeling like I made a mistake
Though I never forgive myself for your heart break

[Chorus]
I said I didn’t mean it
But it’s still in your head
I've learned it’s no easier
To forgive than forget
We thought it was forever
Look at us now
Well, I tried
And I lost more than I found

[Bridge]
Baby, you can’t explain
No, don’t say anything please
No, it's too late

[Chorus]
You said you didn’t mean it
I said I didn’t mean it
I learned it’s no easier
To forgive and forget
We thought it was forever
Look at us now
Well, I tried
And I lost more than I found

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time
You just save me when my life came tumbling down
And I know you're gonna leave me
Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time
Three, two

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Yeah, like a charm, baby
Brighter than this thing on my arm, baby
It's a party every time you come around, baby
Now if you're down, baby
I can be the ground, baby, here me running
Ain't nothing looking better than when I see you coming
Ain't none other feeling better than when I'm blowing money
You can tell that I'm an addict, I'm addicted to money
I'm addicted to ballin'

[Pre-Chorus 1: Flo Rida]
I got the sip of Patron, I bought a ticket to Rome
And by the end of the evening, forget a weekend
We won't even know what planet we on
Cause Monday, so many, goddamn it
Tuesday, she wanna go up
But Wednesday, I panic, come scrambling
Thursday just ain't my luck

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time
You just save me when my life came tumbling down
And I know you're gonna leave me
Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Ordering triple, seeing double, I'm acting single
You on the top, I'm the bottom and she the middle
I did all for the nookie, Oreo cookie
Bout to kill it, shawty, don't push me
Now drop it, you got it
Thank God it's Friday
We love that TGIF, word, yeah
Let's get it popping, baby
Show me something, baby
Or I can blow it on the next girl

[Pre-Chorus 2: Flo Rida]
I got the 151, you got a way with your tongue
And by the end of the evening, forget a weekend
We won't even know what planet we on
Cause Monday, so many, goddamn it
Tuesday, she wanna go up
But Wednesday, I panic, come scrambling
Thursday just ain't my luck

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time
You just save me when my life came tumbling down
And I know you're gonna leave me
Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time

[Bridge: Jason Derulo & Flo Rida]
Saturday, I'm hitting all the beaches
And I ain't talking playing in the sun (no)
Sunday, I'm praying for forgiveness
But the week just begun, hun
Cause Monday, so many, goddamn it
Tuesday, she wanna go up
But Wednesday, I panic, come scrambling
Thursday just ain't my luck

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time
You just save me when my life came tumbling down
And I know you're gonna leave me
Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time
Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time
You just save me when my life came tumbling down
And I know you're gonna leave me
(You gonna leave me)
Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time
(Long time)

[Chorus]
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your main line wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your main line wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct

[Verse 1]
Hip Hop ain't dead, it never died

[?] they flossin' commercial rhymes
And I ain't tryna be the savior
I just wanna read Cudi the Moon Man headlining on a paper
And I'm chilling, watching niggas fuck it up for me
Wanna make it dude, rap about selling D
Nope, I don't fuck with the dope
But I could if I wanted to, all the tips I get off the radio
And I ain't knocking the hustlers, never that
But when I don't rap that, they say my music is whack?
Damn, we got some fuck priorities
Hip Hop revolution should be top of the priority
I'm the minority, in my own minority
All the other bullshit bottom line is boring me
I'm here to make a change like Jigga to his clothes
I'mma make it a big deal so everybody knows

[Chorus]
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your main line wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your main line wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct

[Verse 2]
Everybody gon' follow the bandwagon
And even the phony cats that be prepatratin' and actin'
They got a couple girls, thinking they mackin'
Instead of these hoes who these jerks usually slappin'
Super coolin' it up for the white man's Jiggy
Gettin' go, sellin' his soul deep in the city
This all talk about lil' ass shakin' in clubs
On every song that you got, be about the clubs
Niggas using samples, rapping on samples
Which is cool but it's bad when you don't know who you sample
Don't care who you sample, and that's just simple sense
We can't progress, we lack the knowledge of ignorance, well
In street, better see me for me
Give me some hot tracks, watch me R.I.P
Midwest Action ain't far from the lead
Who more than Kid Mesc could you possibly mean? Nigga

[Chorus]
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your main line wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your main line wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct

[Verse 3]
Man, you know it's hard with the drama
Everybody wanna be hard, startin' a drama
Well I got some advice, be a gentleman first
Then next you should get it to some gangster shit
Make sure it's all real, no waste of shit
Be versatile, flip on some other shit
The only way hip-hop will progress
Is if we all put our all into a track 

[?]
Underneath the sternum to the lungs to the heart
This what everybody shoulda been doing from the start
Wish I from it, gave what the industry wanted
Just cause I'm black a nigga gotta stay drunk and blunted
Well, I do drink and I do get drunk
But you won't catch me coppin', 

[?]
But you will catch me droppin' the truth with the trunk
Kid Mesc got knowledge, Cleveland get him up

[Chorus]
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your main line wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your main line wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct

[Chorus]
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your main line wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your main line wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct

[Outro]
Sucker get ya mind correct, correct

And every bitch a nigga fucked be on my dick
No, I don't know, I ain't always come down to this
My only rule is just don't hit me on my trap phone
You know I can't get caught up on my trap phone
Five stars to my Uber, yeah

'Cause I don't need no Xan', need no lean

Uber on the way, yeah yeah
Told you get on your way, yeah yeah
Roundin' up the bitches like I'm Nino
Took this flow from Travis, I know he know (Straight up)

I'ma put her in that Uber and put her on that trip
Then halfway through the ride, I'm cancellin' that shit, yeah
Halfway through the ride I'm cancellin' that shit, yeah
Shit, you the shit, with the Kylie Jenner lips
Young singin' ass nigga, might give Kylie Jenner dick

And them bitches vote for me. it's like I'm Pedro in this hoe
I be changin' all my exes like a gecko in this hoe, yeah
Ridin' round the city with the lean in my face
Kellz ain't readin' books but he got magazines on his waist

I'm a fly nigga, ain't no Robin jeans on my waist
Yeah, pussy boy, I'll slap that smile clean off your face

Niggas out here going broke for the wild nigga lifestyle

[Verse 1]
It's funny how I can show y'all niggas somethin'
Somethin' more than just coded Ebonics
Somethin' iconic you call that demonic
I guess niggas run from the truth or confront it
Niggas don't see me till' I get the stuntin'
And flauntin' this money
You're both of a culture that's mentally stunted
The murders a constant our houses are haunted
With pain we need codeine and weed just to numb it
Deep in our conscious we know that there's something
More than they teach us way more than we're promise
Stay head of my time I'm just holding my luggage
I hope shit get better before it gets ugly again
Man I'm straight out Atlanta like Coke in yo buggy
A mirror of ballers that ain't got no budget
It feel like Atlantis before it got flooded

[Bridge]
Wait till' I get that band
Wait till' I get that home
Wait till' I get my money right
Wait till' I get put on
Wait till' I get that band
Wait till' I get put on

[Verse 2]
Imitator
Broke niggas fakin' rich nigga behavior
Fuck up a check just to be twitter famous
Niggas switch up on they friend for the paper
Shit look at Kobe he still wit the Lakers
I wake up and say a real nigga prayer
Looked in the mail I just got my advance
Why I'm at the dealership three minutes later?
I fuck up a M
Don't fuck up my trim
What you expect?
When you run from cops yo whole life
It ain't shit just to run through a check
In the red
Now you pressed
Niggas dying
Just to dress, guess that's why it's called fresh to death
Nigga let yo wallet catch a breath
But instead you goin' stunt on yo ex

[Bridge]
When I get my band
Wait till' I get that home

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I suggest you don’t try me
Last thing you gonna expect me
Is hangin’ in the motherfuckin’ tree
With a sniper rifle, smokin’ on weed
Me and juice used to trap on front street
Aw fuck, damn, there go dc
Dekalb county they be riding too deep
Bet them crackers can’t catch me on feet
Pussy you ain’t from no Sunvalley (Valley)
You ain’t bought no weed from old man Lee
You was servin’ 50s and sadies, and I serve a baby and a QP

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
A nigga trend to steal my car (what the fuck)
Somebody tried to break in my house (pussy nigga)
I can’t let ya run off with a ounce, (What the fuck)
Cause thats like takin’ food out my mouth (pussy nigga)
I’mma have to turn ya lights off, I’mma have to turn ya lights off
Money talk and bullshit walk, so I’mma lay your ass in chalk

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
A bitch said gucci can’t speak, he stuck up the nigga so cheap
I said baby girl the dick ain't free
You can try hard but you can’t break me
Remember that bitch tried to double cross me
I tried to flip the nigga SUV
Nigga we can shoot it out like G’s, (what)
He start begging’ pleadin’ gucci mane please
This bitch called me said she need 10 G’s
I told her palm voice Babygirl freeze
I can’t shit off the stuff that she eat
So why help when I can help me
Its Gucci!

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Chorus]
Wanna be a big boy, all these fancy cars
I want a supermodel, take her to the bar
Wanna have a diamond ring brighter than the stars
Wanna take over the world, just to start
Aw yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Aw yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Aw yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
I'm gonna try every drug, but first, where the weed at?

[Drop]

[Verse]
Chances are, you don't know where you're going and where you headed
Don't stop, you have the right of way, and there is no speed limit
It's better with your feet off the ground
You'll feel it once you're in it
It's time to let it go
Was once a child, now I'm a grown man

[Chorus]
Wanna be a big boy, all these fancy cars
I want a supermodel, take her to the bar
Wanna have a diamond ring brighter than the stars
Wanna take over the world, just to start
Aw yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Aw yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Aw yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
I'm gonna try every drug, but first, where the weed at?

She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (hey! )

Hey, I ain't never seen nothing that'll make me go

Hold up wait a minute, do I see what I think I whoa
Did I think I seen shawty get low
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm making it snow

Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack (come on), two stacks (come on), three stacks (come on)
Now that's three grand
What you think I'm playing baby girl I'm the man
I'll bend the rubber bands
That's when I threw her legs on my shoulders
I knew it was over
That heny and Cola got me like a soldier
She ready for Rover, I couldn't control her
So lucky, oh me, I was just like clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster
She showed her

Tattoo above her crack

You wondering why I (Why I)
Don’t come around like I used to
Play around like I used to
It’s not you, it’s me, I got a
A different set of urgencies now
Scared of watching my life go down the drain
Can’t let it be you in my way, so I

[Chorus]
Tread carefully no bra
Tread carefully no panties

And now I regret coming over here
Why you coming over here?

And I bet it’s good cause you know what you’re doin’

Staring down my headlights

Gotta gather all my shit I said I wouldn’t stay all night

U-N-I-T
U-N-I

[Verse 1]
My head fatiguing off the opus
Kept it underground to focus
I feel afterlife, six under oath, don't want no hocus pocus
Niggas tryna go pop, I draw contact, rip my facemask
Nothin' but, nothin' but net, is you Roger or Novak?
You still are no match, you get no rematch
Boy, you missed your moment
Perusing the MoMA, I'm on all my lonely, burst in tears
On his shoulder and it's so cold 'cause he's sculpture
Where's the shaman, Ayahuasca
I had WhatsApp'd him for atonement
I never ever trust the pre-rolled
I never let a random motherfucker shoot the B-roll
I never ask advice from him 'cause what could he know?
Never fuck someone you wouldn't wanna be though
It forever seemed like time's up
When we swerved in the Honda
Now forever seems like no time
I mean, time flies when you have some
Both nuts weigh two pounds, all on your bitch like futons
My crew saved your crew
Like niggas came through with the Groupons
Cookin' with the grease now, truffle fries and Cholula
Are you slowin' down?
Are you holdin' down whoever held you down?
Whoever propped you up, built the structures with you
Swished the buckets with ya, who was fuckin' with ya?
Really brothers when you needed that?
When you see 'em now is it forced black?
Hail Mary on the fourth down
Hands to the sky, yeah

[Verse 2]
Peace to the holy, peace to the people that think they know me
Piece of Moschino, cover your ass, your rectum showing
Peace to the boys that we used to be though
Geto Boy, North Face too cold on these hoes
Peace out to Willie D, Bushwick Billy and 'Face
Piece of steak grillin' in Jesus' name, speakin' his grace
Hands to the sky

[Verse 3]
U-N-I-T-Y, Neptunes and peace signs
Chiraq, Palestine like
Iberville 1995
You'd think that was airstrikes on outside
I put refugees in my villa, play kids the Fu-Gee-La
All this space Atlanta
Place order McMansion and two apple pies
I want the Porsche Bugatti-design
Silicon Valley, new venture is tits up
How do I crop your new bitch out my Vine?
Sick, blue nose pit foamin' white like frappo jacko
El Chapo, de facto
Bell nacho, shell taco, crunch crackle
Green emerald, pink diamonds like Apple Jack bowl

[Verse 2: Lil Duke & (Young Thug)]
(What do they know?)
She know that she want me, she all on my bumper (Skrrt)
Her face is so cute and her ass is humongous (Huge)
I'm still in the trap and she know I do numbers
I could never love her, I do not wanna meet momma
I just wanna go get commas (Racks)
I'm not guilty to your honor (Fuck her)
I am so gifted I'm wanted (What?)
We are so dangerous, we armed (Glah)
I just spent 10 on a charm (Racks)
You cannot catch me, I'm gone (Gone)
Broke bitches leave me alone (Broke bitch)
Opposite of off, I am so on (I am)
I am the king like a game ace of spades (What?)
Bitch know I'm gettin' paid, like 6, 7 ways (And what?)
While you on the block (Makin' what?), makin' minimum wage (Makin' what?)
I work 'round the clock, sittin' at the top and I'm gettin' face (

[?], bitch)

[Verse 1]
Two in the morning, girl you wake me up
Yelling "Some girl is calling" and I just got caught up
Cause you was going through my phone
And saw something you're not supposed to see
Baby girl you are so wrong and that shows you never trusted me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm guilty of one half, you're guilty of the other
So baby we both have to answer to each other

[Chorus]
Stop going through my phone
You're the only one I call on
Stop going through my phone
You ask why I'm tripping like you ain't got no secrets
Stop going through my shit

[Verse 2]
Baby now you're telling me to leave you alone
When I'm there I'm yours baby
I can't control what they say through my phone
Girl tell me why you're looking for something
If you search hard enough you gon' find it
It's fucked up, I ain't done nothing
Baby you're so wrong
You're so wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm guilty of one half, you're guilty of the other
So baby we both have to answer to each other

[Chorus]
Stop going through my phone
You're the only one I call on
Stop going through my phone
You ask why I'm tripping like you ain't got no secrets
Stop going through my shit

[Verse 1: Astrid S]
Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated

[Pre-Chorus: Astrid S]
For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in

[Chorus: Astrid S]
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around

[Verse 2: Astrid S]
We are one of a kind, irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated

[Chorus: Astrid S]
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around

Bone
Come play with it baby
Uh
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah you already know

[Hook 1]
She's  feeling herself a little too much
(Come play with it, you can stay in it)
She's killing her self, why you gotta be so rough?
You done worked your fingers to the bone
She's  feeling herself a little too much
(You stay in it, so play with it)
She's killing her self, why you gotta be so rough?
You done worked your fingers to the bone
(Yeah) their bones

[Verse 1]
You can talk to us, you can walk to us
But you still lost to us
Worth your worth wait in waiting
But that ain't how much you cost to us
You dope though, worth your weight in weight
Borderline fine, but you can't get back across to us
Your dime bags ain't freeway
And you're Ross to us, your cartel, you ain't barball
You a Barbie, you can't maintain that
That's why your bar fell
And your pussy waxed
From letting all them niggas push it back
Nasty nostalgia from all the places you took it at
Flashbacks are where you looking at
Now what? You clear cut
Switching heels, and your hair up?
You know how many bills been inside your pudding pack?
You done clique'd up with some lame
We got to see in a different frame
You the same picture to the same
Niggas that came all inside of your brains
Self approved but don't stunt
Switch it up but don't front
Just to return back to getting turned out
And fucking for what you want
Sucking for what you need
But you don't even really need that
You just suck for love
But you don't even really believe that

[Hook 2]
You feeling yourself a little too much
(Stayed up all inside you, self)
She's killing her self, why you gotta be so rough?
You done worked your fingers to the bone
Their bones
She's feeling herself a little too much
(She played with it, but she can't stay in it)
She's killing her self, why you gotta be so rough?
You done worked your fingers to the bone
(Yeah) their bones

[Verse 2]
You gonna break your back tryna be like these televised hoes that you see on TV
Tryna keep up with a magazine cover, living unreal lives that they heard on CD's
Fake ass, fake face, fake titties, that's great shape
They don't make sense, let's make papes, that's real food but saying fake grace
But we don't care cause it tastes great, this bullshit on these great plates
But who am I to say what's what? But if God real then we fucked up
If God real then we fucked up, if God real then we fucked up
And I can only blame myself and BET uncut
So many shades of gray, in the new generation, they young sluts
Has it always been this way? Squirrels only really happy when they nut bust
You can take a look at the animal kingdom if you don't agree
They be going hard just to get a mate, then get the pussy then leave
And lions be having like four hoes with no clothes, that's so cold
That justifies what's in a nigga mind, they do the same shit for the homos
Stuck up girl be like, "oh no" J. Cole got her looking for a J. Cole
She gon' pass up somebody way cool and end up on some pimp nigga pay roll
Cause...

[Hook 3]
She feeling herself a little too much
(Stayed up all inside you, self)
She's killing her self, why you gotta be so rough?
You done worked your fingers to the bone
Their bones
She's feeling herself a little too much
(She played with it, but she can't stay in it)
She's killing her self, why you gotta be so rough?
You done worked your fingers to the bone
Their bones

[Outro]
I'm sorry I'm just being emotional
I just wanted to get really close to you
But you was being so unsociable
Played this game, it's being so uncoachable
Or is it me and you're really approachable?
But I don't know cause I'm too intimidated
I overcompensated and started roasting you
From afar, and I don't even know who you are
Or maybe I do
But you ain't impressed by my car and that shit ain't cool
Luxury clothes equals fucking hoes, and those are the rules
But you breaking it, these frame change ring, watch, bracelet
This champagne, tasting it, we've been talking like five minutes
Ain't you already supposed to be naked bitch?
But you feeling yourself?
You feeling yourself?
You feeling yourself?
You feeling yourself?
You feeling yourself?
# ok very serious question…

# whose job is it to carry the head on the plane # hash tag #  do you check the mickey mouse head or carry on #  does it get  hot?

# ok another super serious question   ...  is there a portable fan situation?

# hash tag you raised Tidal’s subscriptions by a whopping 🐭🐭🐭downloads

# I’m bored  ### when you get married will your wife have a giant minnie mouse head? # This brightened up my day… thank you dead-mow-five

Do you do birthday parties?? My daughter loves Minnie mouse…

Can you please bring the minnie mouse head … not yours   she specifically likes minnie mouse …

I need you to perform at her party with specifically a minnie mouse dead-mow-five head… not a mickey mouse dead-mow-five head

I’m very detailed oriented and I will know the difference so don’t try to just throw a bow on the original head…

I want to stream you performing in a Minnie Mouse head on @Tidal

[Refrain]
Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter
Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter

[Verse 1]
The bitter boogie comes without a warning
When it's inside of me it is exhausting
I don't like the way it makes me freeze up
And what it makes me say
I know it comes off bitter
Bitter, bitter, bitter
But roll with it

[Refrain]
Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter
Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter

[Verse 2]
I wouldn't like to say I didn't warn ya
'Cause bitter boogie comes without a warning
I really hate the way it mess' my mind up
And all it makes me say
I know it comes off bitter
Bitter, bitter, bitter
But roll with it

[Refrain]
Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter
Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter

[Verse 3]
From the first glance, had no chance
Making exceptions
That would outlast, searching for a new obsession
Yet I'm too bitter to reconsider
My options twice
Before I ask for your advice

[Refrain]
Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter
Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter

[Verse 4]
I've been grieving for no reason
That seems wise
Married to the pipe
With no ambition besides
I'm too bitter to reconsider
My options twice
Before I ask for your advice

[Refrain]
Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter
Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter

[Verse]
Marble floors, foreign whores, finna order more
Play that French Montana song, the one with Ross (Haaan!)
Ordered new Raf, it ain't from the store
Came with a piece, bangin' peace if it come to war
She takin' somethin' off, what you stuntin' for?
Fix your WonderBra, my style is rubbin' off
Swear that pussy Oasis if I'm in it raw
Out in London Town paintin' all the wonderwalls
Yeah I'm underdog, spring, summer, fall, winter
Niggas run to law, gun in drawers, gettin' bundles off
Takin' trips to Baltimore, with the raw, door to door
Fender boss, want the vintage Porsche with the oven doors
I just wanna have a little fun with y'all
But on the real, no, I kill folk
Growin' up I had a best friend who used to mail coke
Successful with the shit until the day they heard the seal broke
My other partner got a million dollars and he's still broke
My thot a primadonna and she whinin' cause her nail broke
Niggas comin' at me sideways like they heel broke
And I'm just glad I ain't ever gotta deal dope
Cause the vision was this tradition and pants
Whole squad in this bitch, all we missin' is Yams
Caught a wish and got bitches in France
Chain swing, see the king and they kissin' my hand

[Intro: Tyler, the Creator & A$AP Rocky]
I'm not crazy, I'm a fuck—ohh, shit!
Floopy goober, motherfucker (Floopy fuckin' goober)
Hey, man, god damn, hey, bro
They ain't ready for what we 'bout to bring back!
They ain't ready for Tyler with the green hat!
Ugh, fuck it
They ain't ready for the WANG$AP, niggas!
I—I'mma rap this next verse
Fuck is niggas talkin' 'bout, nigga?
Yo
We gon' die legends!

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator & A$AP Rocky]
I hope you stackin'
I hope you puttin' some money to the side, my nigga, and payin' your taxes (Yeah)
I hope you not incriminatin' you and your niggas on songs if you trappin'
I hope you dressin' yourself and not followin' niggas opinions on fashion
I hope them cars that you drivin' ain't rented just to get some comments on 'Gram
Oh, shit, they are, because you not the man
Low self-esteem, hide it in lean (Yeah), Xan every meal
You fuckin' weak, and you robbin' your plug? (Yeah)
You ain't got no plan, but I'm not here to judge
'Cause, apparently, you're doin' your thing
Talk your shit, Young Nigga! Woo!
I know they see me
Your pants got a flood, a little bit Katrina
Oh, you wearin' Vans and Supreme this season?
Stop lyin' to yourself, nigga, me the reason
AHH! Right now, nigga
Ugh, right now
A little gooey with some nice sounds, huh
This little groupie want the pipe now, yeah
She eatin' coochie, kinda dyke now, ugh
Got a new dirt bike, wow
And it match the go-kart, go "skrrt!" now (Talk your shit!)
I really want the La Ferrari, but shit (Vmmm)
Can't you lower the price down?

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky & Tyler The Creator]
Fuck right now
Ayy! Ayy!
Fuck right now
Woo! God! Ayy
Ayy right now, nigga
What the fuck right now!
Go right now, nigga
What the fuck right now!
Bite down, nigga, here we go!

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator & A$AP Rocky]
'Cause I'm not one (Woo!)
When it come to a vision, they ain't got one (Woo!)
Rolling Stone never gave me a cover, so...
Um... (god) So I shot one! (Woo!)
I ain't do college (Woo!), I said fuck them lessons (Yeah)
I ain't join no gang, I said fuck them weapons (Yeah)
Grabbed the keyboard, Clancy crossed my path (Woo!)
Cashed my first check and said "Fuck depression, nigga!"
(Got this money!)
Nigga what you scared for? (Woo!)
Everybody lean, everybody gang though (right)
Nigga you a new slave, I'm an old one
Thanks to Ben Yang, still walk around with chains on (Right)
Like you ain't seen no shit like mine (Woo!)
You ain't seen no dick like mine
Nahhh—pause

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
What the, what the fuck right now?
What the fuck right now? (Right now!)
What the fuck right now? (Golf Wang, nigga!)
What the fuck right now? (A$AP Gang, nigga!)
What the fuck right now?
What the fuck right now? (Ay ay ay ay)
What the fuck right now?
(These niggas don't know what we 'bout to do)
What the fuck right now? (Ay man)
(These niggas don't even understand! Goddamn, man!)

[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator & A$AP Rocky]
Told you dickheads I'ma go nuts (Woo)
Niggas told me to grow up (Hanh?!)
So I matured to a V10 (Skrrt, skrrt)
I'm in a vacant lot doin' donuts (Skrrt, skrrt)
There go my ego, Leggo my Eggo
Never sip syrup, shout my nigga Schooly
Y'all don't want beef, let us know he can eat that bread
Cause he pushin' that mayo, fuego (Oww!)
Respect when you see him
Boy, last album was a musical museum
Somethin' always lost with you niggas like Liam
Neeson, boy, you better run (Yeah!)
Here I come, snortin' glitter, portrait pictures
I don't run with many cause their walk is bitter
Niggas mad at T, where the tall freckled white boys at?
'Cause I don't fuck with niggas (Woo!)
That's not my homie, that's not my whoadies (Yeah!)
That not my team, nigga, they're benchwarmers (Fuck 'em!)
I am a stormer, I am a trooper (Fuck 'em!)
I am a Koopa, bet it lost its value as soon as I moved it
I run the business, I do not got time for niggas' opinions
They fuckin' stupid, don't need 'em, don't want 'em
I drop 'em, they're deadweight, them niggas useless
Neck heavy like mothafuckin' bad news (Woo!)
Thanks to Ben Baller, walkin' with a hunchback
I got a new white one that I worked hard for
So the doors on my car doin' jump-jacks (Riiight)
My big bro Frankie got a Porsche (Hanh?)
My little brother Taco got a Bimmer
If you see 'em around me, they eatin'
We all good, it's like FEMA, but of course

[Interlude: A$AP Rocky]
Get money, nigga! Get money!
All you funny-lookin' niggas, back the fuck up!
Ayy, ayy, ayy, man

[Bridge: Tyler, the Creator]
Um, oh, I wanted to add this
I sit in room with a to-do list, pro-
Ceed to do and play acoustics, you
Sit around and look at me feelin' foolish
Rollin' up and make excuses, fucking losers
Jesus, damn man

[Outro: A$AP Rocky & Tyler, The Creator]
Fuck them niggas! Ayy, man, ayy, man!
What the fuck right now!
Ayy I just got one mothafuckin' question:
What the fuck right now!
Why the fuck these niggas wanna look like you now?
What the fuck right now!
Why the fuck these hoes wanna fuck a nigga like you now?
What the fuck right now!
Why the fuck these niggas frontin' like niggas ain't been invented the swag they runnin' with?
Why the fuck is niggas actin' like niggas ain't the originators of this shit?
Man, I tell these niggas they can die and suck a dick!
How was that?
Cool?

[Verse: SZA & Kendrick Lamar]
They say the government mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth
(Tell 'em when you went to the park and everybody came back and...)
And welfare don't mean well for you, you, you, you
(What about when you tried to do a side for that but you...)
They tell me that my bill's past due, due, due, due
(Talk about the charge you got...)
And preacher man don't always tell the truth, truth, truth, truth
(Do you believe in God? If you don't, it's cool)

[Segno: SZA & Kendrick Lamar]
(But) head is the answer, head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
(Don't tell them when you second guess yourself I need you in the kitchen now I forgot...)
Come on give me some help, hey
Head is the answer, do it for the future, girl

[Bridge: Lance Skiiiwalker & SZA]
Don't second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
And I just wanna
And I just wanna
Straight up
Eyes with my head
And I can't use some help
Straight up

[Outro: SZA]
Head is the future

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
These metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what I see
A Gemini, duality personalities always conflicted me

[Bridge 1: Kendrick Lamar &  CeeLo Green]
Oh! But don't be scared of me, girl
I can explain
I know it's foreign to you
I know it's hard to believe
God give me the favor
Let me explain
More than a compliment
And I could use some assistance, let me show you how
I can explain
Oh shando! I spin around two times
I'll be there with the answer
Let me explain

[Verse 1: CeeLo Green]
I'm bizarre, avant-garde
Both sides of me are evenly odd
It's attractive, you're intrigued
Am I mortal man or make-believe?
Anything you want to know (I can explain)
I can explain it
Any misunderstandings, baby (Let me explain)
I can explain it
Why don't you sit and talk to me a while? (I can explain)
Let me explain it, ahh yes (Let me explain)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
My mama told me that I was different the moment I was invented
Estranged baby, no I'm not ashamed
I recommend every inch of your lunatic ways
Praise the lord, you teach the kids how to be themself and plenty more
You know the male species can be redundant
I mean we love a woman and think we can satisfy her
Between sheets, covers and pillows
I'm promising your lack of tolerance stuck on a zero
I'm promising that I'm acknowledging you as my hero
Cause you believe in me
No you're not easily impressed
But I possess qualities that you need to see
Look at my flaws, look at my flaws
Look at my imperfections in awe
Look how you unique that my mystique is a round of applause
And yours equally valued
You stick out like an alien compared to those around you
And that's alright because I like it
You and me are the same
Hopefully I'm invited, hopefully you don't change
Because I know for sure who you are

[Bridge 2: Kendrick Lamar & CeeLo Green]
I can explain
Your mama raised you, your daddy raised you
Hand-washing your clothes on Sunday
Let me explain
Walking your brother to school, three miles away
To feed the mind and soul
I can explain
Don't you explain that, don't you explain the reason why your mind, it travels
Let me explain
I wanna know what you think
I wanna pick your brain when I see you
But don't you ever
Let me explain
Oh shando! I spin around two times
A blessing in disguise
I can explain
I know for sure who you are
You're the goddess of the odd
I am yours
I can explain

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I am yours
I am yours
I am yours
I am yours
Ndiseza ndingene laduma vumile
Ndiseza ndingene laduma vumile

[Intro: Bilal]
Come here, girl
Oh, you want me to touch you right there?
Oh, like a little lamb, play in your hair
Oh you want it? Oh you want it right now
Like that? I got you baby
All on you baby
Push it back on daddy
Push it back on daddy, baby

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
I seen it vividly, jogging my brain memory, life no—
I seen it vividly, jogging my brain memory
Life no longer infinity, this was the final calling
No birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking
We all nervous and crying, moving in caution
In disbeliefs our belief's the reason for all this
The tallest building plummet, cracking, and crumbling
The ground is shaking, swallowing young woman
With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
The smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable
Preachers touching on boys run for cover, the paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into dust
Famous screaming in agony
Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling "he's alive"
Backpedaling Christians settling for forgiveness
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tides out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
(It's happening) no more running from world wars
(It's happening) no more discriminating the poor
(It's happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure
I swore I seen it vividly
A moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony
Thunder like number four, then I heard
"What have you did for me"
I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
That dated back to June 17th, 1987
My paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes, pray to God that I live forever
Dark skies, fire and brimstone, some of us sent home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
Geez Louise, I thought you said that I excel
I made To Pimp a Butterfly for you
Told me to use my vocals to save mankind for you
Say I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for you
I tithed for you, I pushed the club to the side for you
Who love you like I love you?
Crucifix, tell me you can fix
Anytime I need, I'ma start jotting everything in my diary
Never would you lie to me
Always camaraderie, I can see, our days been numbered
Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
I guess I'm running in place trying to make it to church

[Outro]
Young nigga act an ass
Young nigga act a fool
Young nigga get yo' cash
Young nigga do what it do
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Whatever makes all of you happy in this bitch
Just take it all back before the light switch

[Hook: Anna Wise & Kendrick Lamar]
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow
And this I know

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my drum
Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular, I'm drunk
How come I can make them popular, pop em' when I want
See I'm livin' with anxiety, duckin' the sobriety
Fuckin' up the system, I ain't fuckin' with society
Justice ain't free, therefore justice ain't me
So I justify his name on obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinkin' to myself, hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinkin' by myself, at the intersection, parked
Watch you when you walk inside your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your fuckin' door and blowin' out
Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms
Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain, I'm gone

[Hook: Anna Wise]
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me

[Verse 2: Punch & Kendrick Lamar]
He drove alone, with a bottle of his own grippin' the handle
Lit off Henny, I'm tryna dismantle
These wicked ways, I've engaged in such a gamble
'Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel, wait
That's a bit ambitious maybe I'm trippin'
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension
Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance
It's such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall
Studied the son of God and still don't recognize my flaws
I guess I'm lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful
I pray my experience helps you
As for me I'm tryna sort it out
Searching for loopholes in my bruised soul
But who knows?
I just need a little space to breathe
I know perception is key, so I am king

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Jay Rock]
The other side has never mortified my mortal mind
The borderline between insanity is Father Time
I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that I'm blind
I know that I'm intelligent, my confidence just died
Carpe diem, seize the day, I can't compromise
A tapeworm couldn't cure this gluttonous appetite
A couple trinkets, they seein' me as I pacify
But couldn't fathom the meaning of seein' sacrifice
I'm passin' lives on the daily, maybe I'm losing faith
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
Professional dream killers reason why I'm awake
I'm sleepwalkin', I'm street stalkin', I'm outta place
Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes
Before I blink, do I see me before them pearly gates?
Or this is just a mirage or a facade
Wait

[Interlude: Egypt]
Compton is where I'm from
Is where I'm from, where is I'm from

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, yeah
Young Egypt
Look, look

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
I feel like Pacino in Godfather, I'm charged
Our Father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds
What an accomplishment, broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous till I dealt with the consequence
The greatest, the latest mogul, you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like y'all fear God
You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of making your choice in writin' your bars
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital, avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies
With batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin' my stock rise
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
Just premium gas, do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
Black excellence, pessimist, die countin' my coin
Hope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and beamers and blue leather
Forecastin' my future, this is the future
The mastermind, until my next album, more power to you
*Gunshot*

This is a fifteen minute song (Ahahaha)
We're just jammin' out, we on stage

Hundred thousand (Aw, yeah, aw, shit, hahahaha)
Hundred thousand, you gotta see it!
Look, look, look, go back to the down note
They all sing this shit, everybody

Now I don't let you down, down for
You see, you see, you see, you see (Right)
But I don't shake you down, dog for you, you, you, you, uh
They say the government ain't the truth, truth, (Mhm) truth, truth
And the politicians always mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & Taz Arnold]
But head is the answer
Head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
Hey one more time, band, I need y'all to help me out right now (Hahahaha)

Come on, come on—my background singer—come on, come on (Right, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Taz Arnold]
I said, girl, you make me wanna, uh
Great, the—the ho's screaming now, uh (Hahahaha)
I said baby you make
You make me wanna just, ah!
Baby, (Hahahaha) you got me speechless right now
(Hahaha, you gotta take it there)
I gotta take it there, I ain't even playin' no more
Uh, said you just make me wanna drag you down
To the ground, to the ground
Like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
Ju—you just make me wanna drag you down
To—down, around like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
And, baby, if your mama's around if your mama's around
If your mama's around if your mama's around
Tell her, tell her
No discrimination (Haha), she young nigga chasin' (Ahahah!)
And she can get this dick too!

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I said come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Yeah, nigga
You gotta do it, man
We gonna lay that shit
We gonna lay that shit man and watch what it's gon' do

[Chorus]
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

[Verse 1]
Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the Fifth Amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow
Wait a minute!

[Chorus]
Now, why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

[Verse 2]
My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
Intuition got a broke bitch wishin'
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it
Bitches don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
If you can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But shit, ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them

[Chorus]
Why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

[Verse 3]
I wrote this song looking at a broke home baby (broke home baby)
You know the poverty stricken the little broke born babies (broke born babies)
Somebody yell "Kendrick American, they sho’ is crazy"
And I said “why?”
Then he looked me in the eye, and said "nigga you fucked up"
You’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
You never been through shit, you’re crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain’t shit, I live in a hut bitch
I'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent
I prayed my way through by waiting on Allah
You played your way through, by living in sci-fi
Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing goes for the ones you came with
When y'all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope
These days ain’t no compromise
And your pain ain’t mines half the time
A brand new excuse ain’t shit to me
Bitch, I made my moves, with shackled feet
Cape Town

[Interlude]
In today's day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
You wait on them, him and her
But when a blessing takes too long, that's when you go wrong
You selfish motherfucker

[Chorus]
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

[Outro]
Pimp pimp (hooray!)

[Intro]
Pimp-pimp (Hooray)
Pimp-pimp (Hooray)
(Hooray)
Pimp-pimp (Hooray)
Pimp-pimp

[Bridge 1]
I'm sick and tired of being tired
Can't pick a side, the Gemini
Prophesize if we live or not
Promise momma not to fear nobody
Seen black turn 'em Burgundy
Hundred of them, I know I'm greedy
Stuck inside the belly of the beast
Can you please pray for me?

[Verse 1]
Get God on the phone, said it won't be long
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
My hood going brazy, where did we go wrong?
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
Get Top on the phone, tell the squad come home
We gon' ball again 'fore he call us home
World is going brazy, where did we go wrong?
It's a tidal wave, it's a thunderdome
Get God on the phone
I just got a raise (I just got a raise)
Spent it all on me (I spent it all on me)
Diamonds all appraised (Diamonds all appraised)
And I'm bossing up (And I'm bossing up)
Bitch, get out the way (Bitch, get out the way)
I'm the only way, we can fornicate
Ah, pimping and posing, look what I drove in, ah
Having these hoes and I know that I'm chosen, ah
I live by the code and me and my bros and, ah
My dollars ain't foldin', you was never the homie

[Bridge 2]
Seen black turn 'em Burgundy
Hundred of them, I know I'm greedy
Stuck inside the belly of the beast
Can you please pray for me?

[Verse 2]
Get God on the phone
Said it won't be long
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
My hood going brazy
Where did we go wrong?
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
Get Top on the phone
(What's up, my nigga?)

[Verse 3]
Cornrow Kenny, he was born with a vision
All morning with the mixed dashboards, triple digits
Parallel park like an alien came visit
Slideshow for the night show, ten bitches
Find hoes with a blindfold, King Kendrick
(Hello, Billy)
So many plays, homie, I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I confess
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure fuck with him, you get killed
Fuck with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
I did a lot of dumb shit in my past
Lord forgive me, hoping I don't relapse
Dave just bought a new 911
Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
Me, I'm 'bout to let my hair down on hoes
Top billin', that’s a million a show
Might blow the whole no whammy on Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave caught a Grammy last year
Mack wop, bet he do what he want
Fuck you niggas, level two, I'm not done
2Teez told me that I'm the one
I can put a rapper on life support
Guarantee that's something none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
What is like twenty-five hundred a month?
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I certified all of these ones?
Bitch, I get buck, I'm as real as they come
Shit is amazing, I'm feeding my cravings
You know that you want me, come here now, lil' baby
I'm fuckin, I'm crazy
Serving it like I belong in the basement
Or live at the Days Inn
Yan Yan my relative, black cherry soda
Pistol and poverty, come get to know us
(Get Top on the phone)

[Outro]
Who doing the drums?
Man put that nigga on the drums man
Yep, all day, "Mortal Man" and "Kunta"
Alright, from the top

[Verse 1]
Everyone thinks I am shallow
When I'm hiding in my room
Safe within my zone
All the demons that I summon
Wipe the blood off of the floor
It’s my only law

[Bridge]
Sorry!
Whoo!

[Chorus]
N, G
R, I
Mundane
Bloodstain
NGRI, in my brain
Keep a clean
Bloodstain
Bloodstain
Bloodstain
Bloodstain

[Verse 2]
I've awoken from my slumber
I was dreamin' 'bout a flood
Covered in my blood
Now my pits are getting sweaty
It's a sign I've got to go
Back to where I know

[Bridge]
Sorry!
Whoo!
Suffer endlessly
Suffer endlessly
Forever giving in to

[Chorus]
N, G
R, I
Mundane
Bloodstain
NGRI, it's plain
Wipe it up
Bloodstain
N, G
R, I
Mundane
Bloodstain
NGRI, in my brain
Sweep a clean
Bloodstain
Bloodstain
Bloodstain
Bloodstain
Bloodstain
Bloodstain
Bloodstain
Bloodstain
Bloodstain

[Verse 1]
Dark and cold
Out my front window
I can hear her say
From two miles away

[Chorus]
“This can’t be over, can’t be over”
Heard her before
Knocking at my front door
I said “What’s the problem?”
She said “It’s the cold cadaver, cadaver”
“Cold cadaver, cadaver!”
I was sleeping
When I heard her preaching
I said “What’s the problem?”
She said “It’s the cold cadaver, cadaver”
“Cold cadaver, cadaver!”

[Verse 2]
My tongue is big
But not as big as his
Nostrils, mouth and ears
Start to disappear

[Chorus]
“This can’t be over, can’t be over”
Heard me before
Banging on her front door
She said “What’s the problem?”
I said “It’s the cold cadaver, cadaver”
“Cold cadaver, cadaver!”
“Cold cadaver, cadaver!”
“Cold cadaver, cadaver!”
“Cold cadaver, cadaver!”
“Cold cadaver, cadaver!”

[Verse 1]
It’s always in between the lines you thought you read
The time and distance, keyhole, needle through the thread
I can’t help but be sad sometimes
Talk to me, see what’s on my mind

[Verse 2]
If I could step backwards somewhere into the past
I’d relive that great party where we had a blast
Pondering things in the past makes you blind
Look ahead, you’ll not waste your…

[Chorus 1]
Time mends furrowed brows
I can’t help but thinking now
Back here, I’ll wait
Please, don’t let the past be my... fate

[Verse 3]
It takes two cats to enjoy a cool jamboree
It takes three to remember that one differently
Memory’s a fog, it gets thicker with time
Look at the clock, its hands read the…

[Chorus 2]
Time mends furrowed brows
I can’t help but thinking now
Back here, I’ll wait
Please don’t let the past be my...

[Chorus 1]
Well, if time is money
Then it sounds funny to give me so much time
And no money nearby

[Verse 1]
I know when my gums start bleeding
And pissing over my teeth
That I’m low on my buck
Without any luck
And all I gotta say

[Chorus 2]
Why is time my money?
'Cause it sounds funny to give me so much time
And no money nearby

[Verse 2]
I know when my eyes start itching
That I’m in need of a fuss
And I’m low on my buck
Without any luck
Head in my hands
To see that I am so stuck
And all I gotta say, all I got to say

[Chorus 3]
Why is time money?
'Cause it sounds funny to give me so much time
And no money nearby

[Outro]
Time is money, time is money
Time is money, time is money

[Verse 1]
Most of what I like
Is given to me by
The one that I love
Bears the onus every time
Technically I don't deserve
To live this kind of life
Perturbed at what I might become
Unchanging every time
Ecstasy is what I'm needing
I'm bleeding from the eyes
You always shut your eyes
When you look me in the eyes

[Chorus]
Always caressing
The ropes which I've frayed
The corpse that I'm dressing
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed

[Verse 2]
Face to face is nice
But sharper than a knife
I teeter on it's edge
Just waiting to be sliced
Returning home brain dead
And you inject the life
Appeal to me love
Remake, rebuild, revise
Restavit is what I'm bleeding
A laxative to cry
You always shut your eyes
When you look me in the eyes

[Chorus]
Always caressing
The ropes which I've frayed
The corpse that I'm dressing
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed

People, can you hear me?

Leave the world behind you ...
Leave the world behind you ...
Leave the world behind you ...
And leave this world behind!

[Verse 1]
Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window
And the traffic wrote the words
It came ringing up like Christmas bells
And rapping up like pipes and drums

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll wear it till the night comes

[Verse 2]
Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains
And a rainbow on the wall
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you
Crimson crystal beads to beckon

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
There's a sun show every second

[Bridge]
Now the curtain opens
On a portait of today
And the streets are paved with passersby
And pigeons fly
And papers lie
Waiting to blow away

[Verse 3]
Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey
And a bowl of oranges, too
And the sun poured in like butterscotch
And stuck to all my senses

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses

[Outro]
When the curtain closes
And the rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By candlelight
By jewel-light
If only you will stay
Pretty baby, won't you
Wake up, it's a Chelsea morning

[Verse 1: Sy Ari Da Kid]
Here we go again, I know all your friends
I can tell they want me, but they gone pretend
I know I ain't perfect, that I won't defend
I say they living single, you gone say I'm going in
You can be my Cinclair, I’ll be your Overton
No offense, I'm noticing, sometimes you go low as them, phone 'em in
I say fuck 'em, you can tell 'em that I'm saying that
If  they know so much 'bout these niggas, where they man at
I'm like damn that, get your man back
Tell 'em sit down, I can't stand that
Watching Martin got me thinking 'bout yo Pam ass
Always blocking, like where yo tan at?
Yeah...

[Hook]
What did I do, what did I do to them
Tell your friends gone with the wind
What did I do, what did I do to them
Yeah...

[Chorus]
Love you for life
What did I do, what did I do
Know that they be hating
Girl you would know
What did I do, what did I do

[Verse 2: Tink]
Hanging with your guys, that's why I'm always put off 'til you're done and that ain't no fair
Boy you got some fuckin' nerve, boy you got some fuckin' nerve
Cause you're mine but you're barely around
Do your guys come before me now
If I'm queen then why do you play
Even that's what they say
But how can you blame them
I'm tryna spend some quiet time, but 2k's all that's on your mind
Said your childish ass ain't gone ever love me
What did I do, what did I do to you...
For you to be this petty
Remember how you left me
(Sy Ari: What did I do, what did I do to them)
It just seems like you neglect me
The only time you're here is when we're sex-sex-ing

[Chorus]
Love you for life
(Tink: Yeah, right!)
What did I do, what did I do
Know that they be hating
Girl you would know
What did I do, what did I do

[Verse 3: Sy Ari]
They not true as us
I keep it true enough
That's why they keep they eye on you because... they not really used to love
That's why they always at that newest club
They do the most, but they ain't doing much

[Verse 4: Tink]
Hypocrite!
Wasn't you just at the strip club
You and all your single friends throwing dubs, rolling blunts
Guess they ain't much different from my friends
So tell me what's your beef with them

[Verse 5: Sy Ari Da Kid]
You know me
You showed me true colors
You owe me
And I'll slide through on y'all crew like skrt
And I got you, but they not cool... to me

[Hook]
What did I do, what did I do to them
Tell your friends gone with the wind
What did I do, what did I do to them
Yeah
Phantom soldiers marching off to war
Never knowing what they're fighting for
Tell me what decides who has God on their side?
There's no reason, it's the season
Is there any war that is worth dying for?
There's no reason, it's the season of the dead

Death and glory, same or storyline
Children of the future lost in time
Deadly choice of war that kill more than before
There's no reason, it's the season
Dead men don't come back when they're under attack
There's no reason, in the season of the dead

Is this the end of relieved glory
Living in this purgatory
King and country, call for sacrifice
Shame or honor is the only choice

Mystic forces on pale horses ride
Bearing hunger, plague and genocide
Senators of state with their prophets of hate
There's no reason, it's thy treason
As they light the fuse no one can refuse
There's no reason, it's the season of the dead

[Verse 1]
I took a pill in Ibiza to show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA, I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

[Drop]
I-I know are sad songs
I-I know are sad songs
I-I know are sad songs
I-I know are sad songs

[Verse 2]
I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

[Drop]
I-I know are sad songs
I-I know are sad songs
Sad songs
I-I know are sad songs
Sad songs
I-I know are sad songs
Do you remember
When I saw you
I was on tour
I kissed your forehead
You just stared out the window

Can you hold me
Does it feel alright?
Is it okay
If I go outside
And I play in the tall grass?

You are so lost

Do you remember
When I saw you
I was on tour
I kissed your hands
And you looked up
And you smiled at me
And you said how are you

[Intro: Toro Y Moi]
This is all electronic?
This is all electronic?
This is all electronic?
This is all electronic?
Can't you tell?

[Verse 1: Toro Y Moi]
What's wrong with you?
I don't know
Do you want to stay in Columbia?
I'm trying
Eat shit
Fuck you
Do you not like this place
I don't know
Are you too good for it?
No
Are you going to help it?
I'm trying
Your art sucks
I know
Get better
I'm trying
Can't grow facial hair
I know
You cuss too much
Shit
Take more showers
No
You have too many t-shirts
I know

[Bridge: Toro Y Moi]
The chance of my best friend's gonna keep in touch is really high
Is so high
The chances that i'm gonna keep in touch with my mom is high
Very high
Cause I'm gonna try and be the person
That I see in my eyes
I'm gonna try and make myself just a little bit better
In my mind
And I'm gonna try and do something
That you can't believe
That i have done
And i'm not the only one who's thinking like that
And i'm not the only one who's thinking like that

[?]
God is a woman
Although this idea's untraditional
I think God is a woman
Making each one of her children original
I stare at the sky until the stars start to fall
If there's a God at all
It's a woman

I'm just a man
Made up of milestone achievements
In my 

[?]
For I am just a man, child
Inspired by things I've seen
For things to say
So I kiss the ground I walk on
And she's the air I breathe
God is a beautiful woman
I believe

Oh, God, yeah
Praise God
Mmmm, mmmm, mmm, mmmm
God's still a woman
Although her human condition's contradictory
God's still a woman
She has made everything including history
So exalt her high above you
Beyond the brightest star
She'll be everywhere you are, are
She's your mother, oh, mmmm
I'm your brother, oh yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh, mmmm

Shoe game six, six, and steipers and Birks
I like it, I perch
Vixon and viper the first
Viper the first
You like two and a third
Like who is this bird
You like who in the fur
You heard it a her
Little heffa in the flat 10 dollar skirt
Bitch, never spit the stack on the frock of the purse
The buzz of the block, why nah-nah be the word
The stock of the hills
Spit fire flame for real
When I vamp down the catwalk, I pump it for real
Liquorice lipstick, candy coated, the deal

Ostrich, platform

Beauty Bambi, young, determined and willed
No previews, baby, it's only premieres

I don't, I don't kn-know what you want
But I know, kn-know that you don't want
None, no you don't want none of me

Not today, boy, don't misbehave
Ok, ok

'Cause it's little A-B, Lady G-A-G-A
Tell your little DJ, better hit that replay
Listen up my nigga when I'm sipping Clicquot
Lemme hit that weed, hey, lemme feel that freak-ay
Finna pop a pill and get that feeling she chased
When I dip and plié
Gimme, gimme leeway
Bitches on my rhythm, off that Heem and he say
He remember me-ay

Lil Boat!
Okay

[Verse 1: Lil Boat]
I've got these strange voices inside my head
Keep a stack and .380 beside my bed
Not to be cool, but in case they run up on me
If y'all bet on my fam, clutch with double on me
Went to school on a dirt road with black hoes and potholes
This shit was just then, this was four months
Late nights with gang on them store hunts
Loitering Walmart for pure fun
Look at me now, all of my classmates like, "Wow"
My teachers like, "Damn"
I remember I didn't have not a fan
Now I step out and Lil Boat is the man
Woah, this shit is surreal
Pockets stuffed in with blue bills
So much people trying to ask how it feels
But, nigga, I don't know
Everyday I ball like finger roll (woo!)
How'd you do it? Only God knows (oh!)
I want to know who's real until the time folds
People looking at Lil Boat with their hands out cause I'm wearing nicer clothes
I'ma stay down with the same niggas I came up with, that's the master plan
26 for a nigga hand, diamonds so cold you might need a fan (woo!)
I don't know who I am sometimes
I might rap a verse, I might sing a song
Came up overnight from one song
One night get her out the thong
Old heads hating on Boat
'Cause I'm young as fuck and I'm rich as hell
Pants low like I'm fresh in jail
But I've been out, motherfuck 12 (woo!)

[Interlude: Darnell Boat & Lil Yachty]
See, he's a little--he's a little bit more aggressive. Well, you know, as this story unfolds, and you know what I'm saying, as the story gets told, uh, I'll tell you a little bit more about Yachty. He's a little bit nicer. Let's call him
Hello? Hello?

Oh, oh, ohhh
Hello Boat, it's so nice to meet you

All these niggas, they hate me (yeah, they hate Lil Boat)
They mad they bitch wanna date me (she wanna fuck Lil Boat)
But they only get one night (yuh)
Niggas wanna fight (they do)
'Cause they see I fuck they wife (I'm on)
Lil Boat hold the title, Lil Boat, that nigga be nice
I said, "Lil bitch, don't you come over here if you ain't sucking dick" (you heard the drill, you heard it)
I keep my gang with me, you know they keep sticks (you know they keep them)

[Intro: Lil Yachty & BigBruthaChubba]
Uh, ayy, uh
Lil Boat (Chubba), Chubba, Lil Boat, Chubba
DigitalNas in this bitch
You know what I'm saying? Niggas see a young nigga, know what I'm saying? Nigga gon' act like they don't see a young nigga
These niggas see a young nigga
These bitches see a young nigga, you know what I'm saying?
Nigga shine, nigga flash, you feel me?
My nigga Ian up in this bitch, you feel me?
What's popping? Niggas know what's going on, nigga
Nigga see how I'm coming, you don't want a problem
Uh, ayy, uh

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Boat boy just copped him some diamonds
She gon' suck my dick 'cause she like how I'm rhyming, it's all about timing
Got 22 bitches on standby, they fuck when I say so
Can't talk till my case closed
I'm hot like a pepper
Don't ash in my whip, bitch, it's basketball leather
Which nigga you rather? It better be me
Maison Margiela just for my black tee
Can't fuck with these niggas and all they rap beef
Got a Tec for a hundred, I'm feeling like money
My mouth looking sunny
These niggas look funny, so I keep the chop
I'm new and these niggas hopin' that I flop
I'mm flop in that pussy, it better be gushy, it better be hairless
Me and Kpreme beat your ass with our bare fists
When I get on, I'ma fuck me a Heiress

[Verse 2: BigBruthaChubba]
24 karat that'll fuck up my teeth
Pussy so wet that it fuck up the sheets
Catch me posted right there on the street
Pocket rocket right under the seat
Wish a pussy nigga would try me
In the kitchen whipping up the heat
Catch Purpp, get his ass beat
Smoking purp and then I ash it
50 band jugg, then I cash it
Fucking your hoe, then I pass it
Purple and lean, that my passion
Make it disappear like it's magic
Don't come to the 6 where it's tragic
Bricks wrapped up in elastic
In Europe with a bad bitch
And all we smoke is that cabbage

[Verse 3: Byou]
I'ma hot box in the drop top
Now the coupe look like a crock pot
Old school cubes in my ear
Damn, they looking like Macintosh
Flyer than an albatross
Rims chopped like applesauce
I don't pay the pussy what it cost
Diamonds look like tear drops
Play with squares like hop scotch
Rims so above the rim
No And1, but anyone of you niggas cross me, I'm up in it
Dump in it, huh?
I'ma catch a body like a cheerleader
I'ma die fly like Aaliyah
R.I.P., I'll see ya when I see ya
40 thousand dollars on the coat
It ain't even cold, I'ma call PETA
Whip it up with the eggbeater
Whole band on one sneaker
Another band on the other shoe l-l-like a nigga on house arrest
Chop the hit, you decompress, raising bars like bench press
Had to get the shit up off my chest, hey, hey

[Refrain: Lil Yachty]
Yuh, ayy, woah, damn, ayy, yuh, ayy

[Verse 4: Lil Yachty]
Had to get this shit up off my chest
Sendin' shots, you might need a vest
26 for a nigga neck
Water diamonds jeweler straight from Fiji
When I'm on my money, I look like a tiki
If you got a problem, nigga, don't you tweet me
I'm a real nigga, Lil Boat don't do Hilfiger
15 hundred for a still picture
Saint Laurent, nigga, these ain't Jordans
Crib fill of clothes like I'm hoarding
In the air while you niggas boarding
If the cake right, I'ma stick a fork in

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Hahaha
That damn Lil Boat, he's something else, I tell you
Yeah, that DigitalNas something else, too
Well, I guess, uh, we gon' go holla at Yachty a little bit
He's, uh, he's-he's more emotional, you'll-you'll see what I'm talking about

[Chorus]
You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
But, fuck you, you fucked me over
You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
But, fuck you, you fucked me over

[Verse 1]
I ain't got time for no diva
Especially when it came from Pleasers
I've got too much ahead of me
Give a fuck about a bitch, I got the recipe
I'm on my way, and ain't no one gettin' in my way
I'm doin' too much, I've done too much

[Chorus]
You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
But, fuck you, you fucked me over
You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
But, fuck you, you fucked me over

[Verse 2]
I know you feel salty
You wish you could be over me
You see how I lie, see how I lie, woah
'Cause your new nigga, he broke
Suddenly, I don't have to say it, you just know
It's too easy to see, I know you wish you could be with me
But no, because

[Chorus]
You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
But, fuck you, you fucked me over
You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
So fuck you, you fucked me over

[Outro]
Fuck you, you fucked me over
Fuck you, you fucked me over
Know you wish you were with me
Fuck you, you fucked me over

[Verse 1]
I just need someone in my life to give it structure
To handle all the selfish ways I'd spend my time without her
You're everything I want, but I can't deal with all your lovers
Saying I'm the one, but it's your actions that speak louder
Giving me love when you are down and need another
I've got to get away and let you go, I've got to get over

[Chorus]
But I love you so
I love you so
I love you so
I love you so

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna pack my things and leave you behind
This feeling's old and I know that I've made up my mind
I hope you feel what I felt when you shattered my soul
'Cause you were cruel and I'm a fool
So please let me go

[Chorus]
But I love you so (Please let me go)
I love you so (Please let me go)
I love you so (Please let me go)
I love you so

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah yeah
LOOPS, MATH HOFFA, SOUL KHAN
JUSTICE, LUX

[Verse 1: Loaded Lux]
Beloved! My life's a knockout
I'mma punch in 'til I clock out
I stuck with it like the plastic on my mom's couch
Eff with it if you rappers know what i'm 'bout
(All I got to show for) All these people I drive out
Wind up, or spring-door-drawer rappers I springboard
World-at-your-fingertips shit 'til I cut the ring off, champ! (mean)
All my lyrics poignant, disappointment (mean)
When all of these niggas pointing could get appointments
Sense of a nigga asking for 40!
But it ain't like any of you niggas could rap it for me (facts)
Facts of the story, I'm going out so glorious
Notorious, all warriors know orators
Spit it for young critics, sketching from my reflection
My manual's a solar panel, wait 'til my son get it
My energy take the imagery, main industry
I think Math thought we were stealing the game literally!
I physically spoke to him before that round
You know, when we try to build
Don't let the Joneses get you down

[Verse 2: Math Hoffa]
(MATH HOFFA!) Lupe sent ya mans a track
All I needed was a chance to rap
I made bands with Smack
Wham bam, now I'm banned from SMACK
What Imma do next? The answer's crack! (Hol' up!)
Do next, the answer's crack!
Heads turn a little harder when you stand for facts
Niggas lying so bad, hope you cramp your back
From the hood, where we can't relax, seen your man relapse
These punchlines I can't retract
I put the lean on the pimp, see 'em dancers slacks (my bad!)
That's wack
Now my knuckles gotta bump 'em with the boom-boom
Me countdown, me come from Brooklyn!
I just came to represent weed
Get my mama out the P's, and niggas hating
You see the dedication, seeming like they seek my resignation
'Cause the streets need a cleaner reputation!
I see you niggas faking, I'm Moses: I need a separation
In the end, I just keep my reservation 'fore I be a mental patient
Why they trying to hate on your bro!?
I need a beat like a creep date-raping a hoe
Glory-hole-ass rappers still waiting to blow
I bring them bars back like you violated parole! (Whoa!)
Blame it on them rough blocks
Razor blades trying to put me in a lunch box
I got a heater turn Peter: nigga, guns pop!
Why step to me? You might as well cumshot!
My destiny is on top, I don't got no time to fail
Devil want my soul, no kind of sale
Can't pimp a Mac, go find a Dell
It's all over: showtime, Adele!

[Verse 3: Soul Khan]
Now I ain't got a catchy song to make y'all love me
My lines fish-hook you 'til your face all bloody
Son, you're fornicating with a force of nature, formulated
When the dude would sport a pager, and Taye rocked Rugbys
It's Hugo Boss, screw your squad
I push them to the sky rim with a fus-roh-dah
And he got hella style to bring 'em in like Ellis Island
Fuck asking "Who's your daddy?"!
SON, WHO'S YOUR GOD!?
I ain't here to fill a quota
I'm here to spill a soda in the memory of every rapper
They should've told ya I am not a human
That's an illusion, I am the End of Days
See you let this plague on the wings of the Enola
Well, I know you wanna hear some punchlines, Lu!
But nowadays, it's kind of hard to be a punchline dude
I mean my double-a time just could be tougher to contra
The truth could hit him harder than them punchlines do
Who got a vendetta? YOU!? Better get a deathbed or two
If I get it crackin', you better expect tentacles
Homie, I can multiply, you could have sent ten of you
I will outlast you, past my centennial
Talk about New York, but still we're the Mecca
And you don't know the time like you still wearing Mecca
My righteous words reach you through these Heisenberg features
So, I know I'm going to blow up like the wheelchair of Hector
Shorty screaming like she in the hentai biz
What the fuck!? Did y'all forget who the heck I is!?
I will burn your house down like it's Left Eye's crib
And then move your family up to where Left Eye lives!
Respect on the rise, but the money stay still
I'm 28, sitting on 28 bills
Son, I can't chill if my cupboard ain't filled
Man, I wonder when they're gonna make the Hunger Games real!

[Verse 4: Lupe Fiasco]
(We need more shit like this man)
Uh yea, 30 bars to go
And whats a cool heart to 30 carts of coal
And whats a cool car when air part is poor
And the poor part means air part is cold
And the cold part is air parts a stove
So everything of them is oven
Also something to understand, what I say is ice trays
And Muffin pans also everything other than's
Well let's call it baked Alaska
Sriracha on the rocks a frozen yogurt on the woks, stop
Even rejection is perfection when i'm thru with rhymes
They cut the floors out my cutting room
Just to make them out the doors of the Guggenheim
Raps catholic church
Discarded bars would kill just to get back in my verse
Now what you just observed is you listening to some shit
That you've never heard and just to make it cray
I was talking about some shit that I would never say
In a playing song by the song that i'd never play
Yeah, even my wrong turns is a better way
Long term, I just come around the corner like the letter J
So I'm on the right track even when I'm led astray
Like misdirected lead let out of the letter K
Slang for chopper, not slang for throw it
If i had a knife you wouldn't even know it
You knockers on flows for those just to bring it back (???)
You know how to say silent K's and reattach chakras
Oh that's a lot to say you never seen him before
Hanging in the hood just like three in a row
Snakes after I just like a G and a Joe
Check out my new chain, I hang a tree from my throat
Hanging a T from a rope, take it from me, I'm a bit crazy
Or you could hear it from the hoes like Dick Tracy
LU

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, woah
Yeah, oh

Never switch up
Never switch up on my gang, no

[Verse]
I stayed the same
I stayed the same when I got to the fame
Didn't change a thing
Only thing changed was a young nigga name
They call me Lil Boat
Hollywood chilling, but I don't do coke
I stayed afloat
Didn't give a fuck what a young nigga thought, no

[Bridge]
I never cared what a nigga thought 'bout me
No, I never cared
And I think that's why they fuck with me
'Cause I stayed down and I kept my originality, woah

[Chorus]
Never switch up
Never switch up on my gang, no
Never switch up
Never switch up with the fame, no
Never switch up
Never switch up
Never switch up
Never switch up, no
Never switch up
Never switch up, switching lanes, woah
Never switch up
Won't let it get to my brain, no
Never switch up
Never switch up
Never switch up
Never switch up, no

[Chorus: TheGoodPerry]
I'm sorry
Yeah, I'm sorry
'Cause I didn't know, baby, I didn't know
I didn't know, baby, I didn't know

[Verse 1: TheGoodPerry]
Alright, I admit it
I fucked up this time, yeah, I did it
Always arguing cause you a critic
But this time, this time
Yeah, I said the wrong line
Wish I could rewind
Want to take you out, fine dine
Want to make you my dime
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus: TheGoodPerry & Lil Yachty]
'Cause I'm sorry
I didn't know, baby, I didn't know
No I didn't know, baby, I didn't know

I didn't know, baby, I didn't know
I didn't know, baby, I didn't know
I'm sorry

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Tell me where you going
Probably somewhere out there hoeing
I'm always quick to judge, yeah, I know it
But this time, this time
I sure caught you slipping this time
Wish I didn't have these thoughts on my mind
But I did some time, oh, what do I do
Oh, that's your brother, not your nigga, baby, I didn't know

[Chorus: Lil Yachty & TheGoodPerry]
I'm sorry
'Cause I didn't know, baby, I didn't know
Yeah, I didn't know, baby, I didn't know

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
I'm sorry
Oh, I'm sorry
I didn't know, baby, I didn't know
I thought I knew but now I know
I'm sorry
Oh, I'm sorry

[Chorus]
For everybody that said that I wouldn't make it
(We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it)
I want you to know
(We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it)
I need you to know
For everybody that said we couldn't do it
(We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it)
Oh, we did it
We did it
We did it
We did it, we did it

[Verse 1]
So for everyone talking down
Anybody who makes you frown
Let them know that's it's possible
Oh, it's possible
'Cause if they ever knock you down
Get up and let them know you finna run the town
Let them know that you got next
Tell them you got now
'Cause you good now
Don't waste time, do it right now
'Cause I did it, and you can do it

[Chorus]
For every teacher that said that I wouldn't do shit
(We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it)
I want you to know
(We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it)
I want you to know
To the youngins that be down on this
(We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it)
To the manager at McDonalds that fired me
I need you to know, we did it
Oh, I need you to know, we did it, we did it

[Verse 2]
Never take negativity from nobody
Stand tall hold your head high
Stand tall hold your head high
Reach for the sky
I never take negativity from no one
Can't nobody tell you no
Never stop, always go
Head down your own road
Never give a fuck, do it if you want to do it
That's what you gonna do pursue it, just do it
'Cause we did it, we did it, we did it

[Outro]
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
We did it
We did it, we did it, we did it

[Intro: Anderson .Paak & Domo Genesis]
It just needs that... uh, that uh....
Yeah
Yeah! Okay (Ooooh)
Yeah yeah

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Hold (hold) that (that) light (come on now)
(Hold out!)
Smoke (smoke) that (that) fire (come on don't stop 'till you)
Hold (feel it) that light (baby you got to, hold on)
Smoke (smoke) that (that) fire

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Baby, we can dance if you like
Shake that pretty ass on the flash of the light
Off of one glance, can only imagine the hype
Trying to figure routes to being in your plans for the night
'Cause I ain't felt this good in weeks
Got a fresh cut now I'm looking for the freaks
Fresh car wash, so don't put your hand on the Jeep
Use your etiquette, and bring your own sand to the beach bit
All around the world, they keep running
Shawty wanna hold my hand, it ain't nothing
Mariah said if it’s worth time, then say something
And when they tell me I'm out of my mind, I ain't budging
Sorry if I'm so overzealous
'Cause I haven't felt no energy like you on this planet
So yeah, put your number in my handheld
And fill that bitches with fan mail, ya dig

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Hold (hold) that (that) light (come on now)
(Hold out!)
Smoke (smoke) that (that) fire (come on don't stop 'till you)
Hold (you feel it) that light (baby you got to
Hold on)
Smoke (smoke) that (that) fire

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Really good, nice to meet ya
Maybe we could smoke a little Indonesia
Shake up the world like a geo seizure
Your love song so strong you don't need no features, no
Little Jimmy, let's park at last
This cupid never hit me in my heart that fast
I watch it burn whoever start that gas to walk a little
But you're either gonna park or crash
It's muscle memory
Walking down a similar path, I feel the energy
Or maybe it's the way I'm feeling from all this Hennessy
I'm way, way bigger than what they tend to be
And you could be my Marilyn Monroe
I'm John Kennedy, you know it
You feel it
'Cause I ain't felt this rhythm in a minute
Gettin' faded until we fall
Got arches, so I hit it
Whether spring, summer or fall
If I want it, I'ma get it

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Hold (hold) that (that) light (come on now)
(Hold out!)
Smoke (smoke) that (that) fire (come on don't stop until)
Hold (you feel it) that light (baby you got to, hold on)
Smoke (smoke) that (that) fire

[Verse 3: Anderson .Paak]
Now I could turn a pussy to a kiddie pool
And I could swim around until my fingers prune
But if you stick around I'll probably sing a tune
If you stick around I'll probably roll another up right now
Can a nigga groove? (uhh, yeah)
Come on!

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
Smoke (smoke) that (that) fire (oooooh)
Smoke that fire  (ooooh)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1: Lil' Snupe]
Chasing after green gods
Went from sleeping on the porch to a motherfucking California king sized
Momma ain't stressin' she know that its all good
My number one goal is to get her out the hood
Never changed, I be thuggin' hard in my section
Me and all my dawgs protected by Smith & Wessons
Any nigga playin' we comin' in your direction
Let you know that we ain't flexing, you quickly gon' get ejected
Niggas want to kill me cause a nigga coming up
Want to kill 'em but that shit might really fuck my money up
Focus on my grind gotta get the stacks
Tryna leave the streets alone but they steady calling back
You ever seen death around the corner
Chilling on the block and pussy niggas run up on ya
Busting shells at you and they hotter than a sauna
It be hard to think straight when its a lot of niggas want ya
Man

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Ok I've been the king for this rap shit
Stuntin' hard and never had shit
Remember me with them nappy braids?
When I was down on my last shit?
Bet them niggas wasn't mad then
Took advantage I asked them
For a shot at this, start laughing
It took a year or two and I passed them
Y'all niggas all look like haters
You ain't even put your dawg on paper
Word around that you tricking on bitches
Catch you with your chain on I'mma take it
Now everybody catching these vapors
Now everybody want and need favors
Southside, NY in Jamaica
Nicki on the bike throw it up, scrape it
With 100 niggas 'hind me
North side down in Philly where you find me
Riding 'round with a 30 on my lap in a big ass phantom
I whip the Bentley like a johnny
Watching out for the 2-11 robbery
Bang motherfucker for the money and the respect
Hit 'em in the head with the stick nigga eject (shit!)
Mo money, mo money, mo money, mo problems (shit!)
Why you think I really went and bought more choppers (shit!)
Mo money, mo money only bringing more robbers (shit!)
Want to see me in a box I went Porsche Boxster
Show me some evidence
Never was better than nor was you relevant
I'm too competitive
Walk in the club, get my .357 in
My level on excellent
I cut the brick like its cards and I shuffle it
You told 'em we selling it
A mouse in the building, I act like an elephant
Who the fuck just let the devil in
Come to my city they treat me like president
Ain't got no pity for niggas that's settling
I had that La La and Melo, was selling them nicks for J.R. Smith
Niggas try to kill me but they all miss
My down fall what they all wish
Had a lot of homies but they all switched
Word up my nigga

[Break: Meek Mill]
(Laughter)

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I see these haters looking at me like I owe them something
You looking bad I prolly throw you something
I see you flexing with that money and I know you frontin'
I caught cases never told 'em nothing

[Post-Chorus: French Montana]
I got all these chains and this change on me (we lit!)
Niggas said I changed man they changed on me (fuck 'em!)
Man it ain't a thang got the thang on me
Man I see a clearport plane on me

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
You see me coming 'round your corner lookin' like I got a check
Flew into your city me my niggas on the jet
Ballin' every time I take a shot I hit the net
And everyday niggas want the money for respect
I ain't trippin' I got money, clothes, car, hoes
Shoppin' 'til the mall close
Lord knows, I could fit a brick up in these cargos
I don't fuck with niggas cause they all told
Worry 'bout another nigga money like they all hoes
I'm just with my niggas spinning hella blocks
Bad bitch on all my Banshee I'm like twelve o' clock
Vroom vroom I might do a hundred block
In the back hundred niggas deep and we like fuck the cops

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I see these haters looking at me like I owe them something
You looking bad I prolly throw you something
I see you flexing with that money and I know you frontin'
I caught cases never told 'em nothing

[Post-Chorus: French Montana]
Got all these chains and this change on me
Niggas said I changed man they changed on me
Man it ain't a thang got the thang on me
Man a see a clear port plane on me, slide

[Outro: Papi]
What's your grandma name
What's your gr-gr-grandma name, grandma name
What's your grandma name
What's my grandma name

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I see these haters looking at me like I owe them something
You looking bad I prolly throw you something

Fuck her one time then I kick her out the drop

Fuck you bitch nigga know I got to get it on

[Chorus]
Whippin' all this dope up in the trap house
We fuck all you bitches at a trap house
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses
And I'm in that bitch like Jerry Stackhouse
I might fall in love with my trap house
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses

[Verse 1]
Wait, shit
Fargo, whippin' all this dope look like I'm sellin' phony
All that nigga want that Rollie with the bezel on it
I see niggas change from friends into them tellin' on me
I see niggas go from friends to gettin' jealous on me
I see niggas call their shooters and their felons on me
I see niggas get religious when their hell was comin'
I had to trust the plug sometimes I had no scale up on me
Whip a couple litres now
Trap house got too hot and now I'm trappin' out my fiend's house
Had to break the lease though
And I pay my little nigga just to watch out for police now
'Cause it look like a four in my kitchen
It look like I'm cookin' with them zoes in my kitchen
I'm water whippin', whippin' four with my kitchen
My nigga Trey, he pack a four for you niggas, yeah

[Chorus]
Whippin' all this dope up in the trap house
We fuck all you bitches at a trap house
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses
And I'm in that bitch like Jerry Stackhouse
I might fall in love with my trap house
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses

[Verse 2]
Uh, when my grandma kicked me out the house
I said, "Fuck it dawg, I'm 'bout to bounce"
I said, "Fuck it dawg, I gots to make it"
I said, "Fuck it", started hustlin' and got that 'cedes
Uh, my nigga Shadow, he come with that ladder
I know some scammers that come with that data
Gotta ask 'em how we pull up in a Lambo
Shout go out to Dream that Bathing Ape and Camo
Fashion bitch, I'm in the latest
I put all my baddest bitches in their favorite fragrance
I might fuck a country bitch that got that diner, diner
I might make a movie with 'em like I'm Damon Wayans, ya' feel?
I might whip the four in my kitchen
It look like a nigga sellin' Os in my kitchen
I'm whippin', my wrist, it feel cold in this kitchen
And I'm flippin' again, where it goes in this kitchen?

[Chorus]
Whippin' all this dope up in the trap house
We fuck all you bitches at a trap house
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses
And I'm in that bitch like Jerry Stackhouse
I might fall in love with my trap house
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses

[Intro: Gucci Mane]

Hella ones, hella ones

Hella ones, pour a drink
Drink outta bottle, then make it rain

[Chorus: Gucci Mane] x2

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
She got that ass I got that stash

And do it fast, and come back, come back
Cause I never seen a body like that, like that
You remind me of some brand new 95 Air Max
A pound of purp in tracks
Baby girl you doing that
And you killing it, Im feeling it
Pretty chick, you super thick
Dont know what to do with it

[Chorus: Gucci Mane] x2

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]

I got a girl, you got a man
I got a room, I got a plan
I got a vette (got a vette) and a hummer
I make it (?) in a summer

[Chorus: Gucci Mane] x2

[Stay Stay Stay]
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away
But you stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
'Cause I've read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said "okay, let's talk"
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay

Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay
Stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life

[Ho Hey]
Ho, hey, ho, hey
So show your family
All the blood that I would bleed
I don't know where I belong
I don't know where I went wrong
But I can write a song

I belong with you
You belong with me
You're my sweetheart 
I belong with you
You belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you
You belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you 
You belong with me 
So please, please

[Stay Stay Stay]
Stay, stay, stay
I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay

Banana in the clip, let the tec spray
Menace to society, oh dawg walk up
Poke your head and then I roll up
Gotta keep it gangster, that's 500
I'm still spendin' this old money
I took the tubes off, put the Vogues on it
Lethal weapon like Mel Gibson, man I stay stuntin'
Niggas is flexing, you ain't with it and you stay frontin'
Nigga check my pedigree I bet it add up
I'm rolling up with niggas like a Mack truck
Big Moeses get the stacks up
Sleepin' on a nigga that's how you got passed up nigga

[Verse 3: Joe Young]
When the beat come on it get darker every time
Spit venomous tales about this life of crime
I come through buzzin' leave a critical mess
How you talk tough wearin' a dress
I wake up stressed amongst the best on the track with a dog
When I bite my teeth sink
But how you gon' see a nigga livin' in the fog
I dealt with rats I rattled with snakes
I battle with hate
The Lord is great, survive the maze
Rebuke the devil in ongoing debates
I try to be cool and try to show love
At the same time I want Trump on his back with his face blown off

[Bridge]
Just cause I love my niggas
I shed my blood for my niggas
Holla where my niggas
I'm right here my niggas
Just cause I love my niggas
I shed my blood for my niggas
Holla where my niggas
I'm right here my niggas

[Verse 1]
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care, baby, by the way

[Hook]
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

[Verse 2]
Here come bad news, talking this and that
Well, give me all you got, don't hold it back
Well, I should probably warn ya, I'll be just fine
No offense to you, don’t waste your time, here's why

[Hook]
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me, how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand...
And then he said, "It's too late to apologize"
It's too late...
He said, "It's too late to apologize"
It's too late...

So this is me swallowing my pride (It's too late to apologize)
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night (It's too late...)
And I go back to December (It's too late to apologize, it's too late)
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you (It's too late to apologize)
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine (It's too late...)
Oh...

He said you're not sorry (no no no)
You're not sorry (no no no)
You're not sorry (no no no)
You're not sorry (no, no, no...)

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty & Famous Dex]
Don't call my phone nigga
I feel like David Chacon nigga
Give my big dog a bone nigga

Coolin', it's me and Lil Yachty
Two bitches out in the lobby
They geeking right up off the mollys
I know them bitches want some money
But baby girl I’m not a dummy
She sneakin’ geekin’ like it’s funny

When you winning niggas like to hate
Especially when you doing great
Got a lot of shit on my plate
So leave me alone nigga
Texting my phone nigga

Give my big dog a bone nigga

Twenty six on my left wrist
Shit looks like a pot of piss
Why these bitches on a nigga’s dick?
Why these bitches on a nigga’s dick?

Especially when you doing great
Got a lot of shit on my plate
So leave me alone nigga

[Interlude]
Hi-errr, this is the Captain ... speaking
We are now descending into Hartsfield International Airport
I'd like to welcome you to Atlanta
We have clear blue skies over Atlanta
Which, by the way, is the home of the Atlanta Hawks, the Braves, and the Falcons
To the far left, you can see the Georgia Dome
Which by the way still flies the Confederate battle flag

Atlanta has been called the new Motown of the South
And is the home of LaFace Records
Organized Noize Productions

If you look to your far right, you can see Decatur
And below you, to the right, is East Point and College Park
Home of the red dogs, rap cats, and robbin' crew
And home to the player, the 'Lacs, and the motherfuckin' Outkast

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Wassup nigga, this is how we guna do it
Let me round the back
Gimme your ID imma roll up in this bitch
Meet me round the back
I'll open up the door for you niggas
We gon do it like this lets go
Holla

[Verse 1]
We the sickest it don't matter, the same we spit game

[?] the front nine, my flows 

[?]
Chamber full of my rage, lames better not start
Ending this shit here and them lyrics rip you apart

[?], your boy he is the one
Nigga born from rap, the only begotten son
2Pac and Biggie up in me like mini who's flow is strong
Hitting your bitches up, all night I'm ripping through thongs
And later I'm ripping songs, consistent when I be spitting
Lyrically I'm a mac, 

[?] once it's written
Ya'll niggas are still ain't getting the point, you'll all fall
As soon as you jump that bridge, you suckas ain't getting across
Pay the cost to be the boss, pay my payments in full
Your game is worse than the Cavs, I guess that make you the Bulls

[?] I'm a fool, I done used a full clip
Gotta reload quick, get ready hold this

[Chorus]
I spontaneously combust when other rappers would rust
Niggas say I got a problem, I wil' out too much
Dude, you know your nigga stay hotta than June
Leave other rappers under the tomb, holla back
I spontaneously combust when other rappers would rust
Niggas say I got a problem, I wil' out too much
Dude, you know your nigga stay hotta than June
Leave other rappers under the tomb, holla back

[Verse 2]
Get on my level, clap bitches grease up the middle
Lyrical riddle, jump in that skillet I'm bound to sizzle
I ain't cop a deal now, so imma stand the ground
Like a basket child until I get found
Gucci stick with it like a McLaren, It's all fitted
Illest nigga to spit it in the Indians 

[?]
City where niggas can split it, and stogies get split
Burners get lit where gully niggas carry the clips, the pits
Can't stop the genes in my cerebellum
Dumb niggas they don't understand hard to tell em
Niggas I know around the block, all felons
Freestylin with my boys, our flow is off the melons
See ya man, we been in the streets rule you fools
Gotta be filthy with burgundy Bentley by the pool
Got em at 8 figures, though expelled from school
Gotta keep myself skippy with them marvelous jewels

[Chorus]
I spontaneously combust when other rappers would rust
Niggas say I got a problem, I wil' out too much
Dude, you know your nigga stay hotta than June
Leave other rappers under the tomb, holla back
I spontaneously combust when other rappers would rust
Niggas say I got a problem, I wil' out too much
Dude, you know your nigga stay hotta than June
Leave other rappers under the tomb, holla back

This is all metaphorically
If you wanna be in this class you gotta study me
This is the final, drink brew, get chewed, then I spit on some vinyl
And niggas tryna hate on mine though
And Imma have to chop em up bag em
Faster than Tony Soprano
I want keys like a fucking piano
Just call me Leroy I got the glow and them haters can't stand it
Young boy Kid must be the bandit, look nigga I planned it
Say your hot, ya'll niggas don't burn
Say you're sick but you don't spread germs
When ya'll niggas gon' learn?
K. I. D.'s gonna leave you under the dirt
Or cremated leave your ash in the urn
Nah I'm sick and tired of sitting back watching these lames get rich
Ya'll niggas pussies all ya'll need is a clit, get in where you fit
Around here, ain't no vacancies
I spit flows and rip shows in streets
Holla back

[Chorus] x3
I spontaneously combust when other rappers would rust
Niggas say I got a problem, I wil' out too much
Dude, you know your nigga stay hotta than June
Leave other rappers under the tomb, holla back
I spontaneously combust when other rappers would rust
Niggas say I got a problem, I wil' out too much
Dude, you know your nigga stay hotta than June
Leave other rappers under the tomb, holla back

[Outro]
2 step niggas, 2 step nigga
Yeah, Kid Mesc nigga

We at the bar we ain't 21
We in the club we ain't 21, yeah
We at the bar and we drinking, yeah

Ugh, yeah, yo

We in the club we ain't 21, you know
We at the bar we ain't 21
We in the club we ain't 21
We at the bar and we drinking, toast

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Peace, no material possessions shall cloud my judgement
As I reach, in an ethereal direction to provide my substance
Love is not found but resides insides me, I manifest this
I will respect myself and wear serenity as my necklace
I will replace what I take and have tranquility as my breakfast
Shed a new light on a new path
I will gain rhythm and lose wrath, attain wisdom and refuse graft
And build upon what I built on and wisely regulate time I do have
Cause what is defeat? But just the evidence of my haste
Lack of preparedness, in my waste, so I wait
Surround myself with nutrition, wholesomeness and true livin'
Use natural codes of conduct to remove schism when the rules missin'
I will pursue felicity, find value in simplicity
Altruism and empathy will be the first thing extended to my enemy
Clarity will be the trademark of my friendships
Just invest in my business and appreciative of the rarity of my existence

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
'Cause I got chillin' by the million, tranquillo by the kilo
Nigga, nigga, what, and I got kilos by the speedboat
And I ain't talkin' 'bout them drugs
I'm talkin' 'bout that love
For myself and all my niggas
All my bitches and all my thugs, what's up?
'Cause I got chillin' by the million, tranquillo by the kilo
Nigga, nigga, what, and I got kilos by the speedboat
And I ain't talkin' 'bout that work
I'm talkin' 'bout that worth
Of myself and all my niggas
Every diamond came out the dirt, nigga

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I got bitches on bitches, all my dreams and my visions
I remember me fishin' out of canals in the trenches
Now a nigga be flossy, Rolls Royce lookin' glossy
Quick to put down a demo to get these haters up off me
I like to smoke to myself, I just try to improve
Let my son hold my strap while I swim laps in the pool
Told my daughter the rules which we all must abide
Your daddy was far from perfect, things we did to survive
I just wanted to fly, they always lookin' down on us
School district full of killers, I mean these niggas ferocious
Only violence and drugs, there was nothin' for us
All I had was this music, I couldn't afford to do much

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
'Cause I got chillin' by the million, tranquillo by the kilo
Nigga, nigga, what, and I got kilos by the speedboat
And I ain't talkin' 'bout them drugs
I'm talkin' 'bout that love
For myself and all my niggas
All my bitches and all my thugs, what's up?
'Cause I got chillin' by the million, tranquillo by the kilo
Nigga, nigga, what, and I got kilos by the speedboat
And I ain't talkin' 'bout that work
I'm talkin' 'bout that worth
Of myself and all my niggas
Every diamond came out the dirt, nigga

[Verse 3: Big K.R.I.T.]
Young nigga say, ball
Cause he ain't really livin' life 'less he's down to roll the dice
Put it all on the line for a couple dollars
And a bad bitch that only think about him if he, call
Is it really worth the time and the effort?
Chasin' woodgrain and the leather
Puttin' pressure on the pedal, I don't want the devil
Hopin' he, fall
Feed him to his nonsense, mothafuck a contract
You don't need a handout, they gon' bring the bands out
Choppas make 'em stand down, good Lord
But you don't wanna be another nigga chasin' figures
That never really add up, white folk pass your
Face dyin' in the grass cause they wouldn't call the, law
Cause your hood is black and they think you're sellin' crack
Maybe so, you don't give a fuck in a rut nigga
'Til those in the street got you stuck nigga, what nigga?
Buck buck nigga
Buried your partner just the other day knowin' he was too young
Had a tool, tryna roll on the folk
Let it go on the folk but he wasn't down to shoot one
Though the time dead and gone, is YOLO what we on?
I heard different, it's never too late to listen and be reborn
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga, go be reborn
Peace and understandin' is what you should be on
My nigga just, ball

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
'Cause I got chillin' by the million, tranquillo by the kilo
Nigga, nigga, what, and I got kilos by the speedboat
And I ain't talkin' 'bout them drugs
I'm talkin' 'bout that love
For myself and all my niggas
All my bitches and all my thugs, what's up?
'Cause I got chillin' by the million, tranquillo by the kilo
Nigga, nigga, what, and I got kilos by the speedboat
And I ain't talkin' 'bout that work
I'm talkin' 'bout that worth
Of myself and all my niggas
Every diamond came out the dirt, nigga

Buckle up, 'cause that ass might crash, yuh

[Chorus]
And I don't really trust nobody

In the night, in the night, in the night, yuh
Movin' on and we ain't looking back for what we left
Leave the crib at 3 AM to cop a cigarette
Just figured out the plan and I'ma stick with it
Hard to talk to people now, 'cause I'm just different
I lost my mind so many times, not scared of losing friends
I gave my all and now I don't have anything to lend

Wait a lil', when the pill gon hit ya

[Intro]
Thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
That's thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours

[Verse 1]
I don't really know if she cares or not
All I know is she left a lot of
Stuff in my apartment
She's never getting back
And as her smell on my pillow fades
Her cigarettes might stay
Like a Roman Coliseum
A dry and worthless monument to our love

[Chorus]
I still have your lighter
I still have your book
I still have everything you brought
But you never took
You know where to find me
And I know where to look
(I'm not a crook)
Thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
That's thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours

[Verse 2]
And I don't really know if she knows or not
But I left some things in her jewelry box
And she's wearing down my rings
Taking the compliments meant for me
And although I think I'll miss them
At least there's proof of my existence
A captive little soldier on her fingers
Deep behind enemy lines

[Chorus]

(I'm not a crook)
Thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
That's thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours

A copy of Gravity's Rainbow that she probably didn't read
How about my Laura Nyro record she probably threw away when she moved
How about the half box of lentils when I cooked her food that she probably didn't use

I wanna dedicate this jam
To all those things I left behind in girls' apartments and various domiciles over the years
Sometimes you gotta leave in a hurry man, what can I say
Except I didn't forget about any of it
I'm taking it all back

[Verse 1]
They call me Arular, trendsetter, makin' life real better
Breaking order like a leader now folla
Proppin' poppin' a collar, yea hustle a dollar
You can't touch us like MC Hammer
With my mum's string hoppers, jump in the chopper
Yea, chop up a mango with salt and pepper
Holla, holla, holla, true scholar with a honour
And I'm here to shine the light on the matter

[Hook]
At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car
Creeping in my socks and slipper
Mexicans say "hola!"
At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car
Hiding in my Toyota Corolla, everybody say "Y.A.L.A.!"

[Verse 2]
Bola a bola got a friend called Booma
And he looks like Obama when we burner
Turtleneck and bomber
It's a Bamboo Banga
And you know I'm comin' back with power
Yea '64 Impala, Hummer or Toyota
When I drive in I'm a winner
Whatever I'mma rap got fuel in the burner
Off the grid, staying off the radar

[Hook]
At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car
Creeping in my socks and slipper
Mexicans say "hola!"
At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car
Hiding in my Toyota Corolla, everybody say "Y.A.L.A.!"

[Verse 3]
Yeah shudda a shudda, yeah shoot a computer
Pour yourself a shot of tequila
Time for a banger, throw up your middle finger
I'm a writer competition we gon' murder
I'm a fighter and a lover like winter and summer
I ain't really looking for no drama

[Hook]
At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car
Creeping in my socks and slipper
Mexicans say "hola!"
At the border I see the patroller cruising past in their car
Hiding in my Toyota Corolla, everybody say "Y.A.L.A.!"

[Verse 4]
Most of the things I do, they banned it
But I'ma still do it, I'm a bandit
I'ma still, I'ma still, I'ma still, I'ma still
But I'ma still do it, I'm a bandit
Most of the things I do, they banned it
But I'ma still do it, I'm a bandit
I'ma still, I'ma still, I'ma still, I'ma still
But I'ma still do it, I'm a bandit
Bandit bandit, ba-bandit
Bandit bandit, ba-bandit

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Fuckin' put on a wrong head-- pair of headphones and shit, uh

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa & Tyler, The Creator]
Just took ten shots and I ain't pass out
Spent a hundred grand and I ain't cash out
If you smoking OG, bring the grass out
These niggas filled up, bring the gas out
Talkin' bout some shit that you know you stole
I have my fuckin' way with this game, no remote control
Drinking on some gin cause I like alcohol
How the fuck you sposed to win, you don't know how to ball
Turnt up but still smoking
Tryna drive but my eyes barely open
See the cars, see the watch, see I done moved up
In my condo smoking out watching True Blood
Tryna take Taco to the strip club
Tryna take Tyler to the dealer bruh (I'm right here guys!)
Tryna take Domo to the weed spot
True pothead so I need pot

[Chorus: Tyler, the Creator & Wiz Khalifa]
Go, I'm so fuckin loaded
Pockets and the smoke and all the bitches
Tell em
Go, faded and I'm floatin
I hope your lungs is open
All the bitches, tell em, go
Now I been around the world before
But I never thought it'd be this way
And I smoked up all this weed before
But I never thought it'd feel this way
And all the bitches be like, "Yeah"

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Celebration shots got me really faded
Kind of famous, enough to laugh like I really made it
Drunk enough to stir some controversy, bitch let's fucking tape it
I feel amazing, making digits off my fucking cadence
Suck a dick, hater while I selfie with the Eiffel Tower
Five star general, the Odd Future I'm Eisenhower
Said I couldn't make it, I show you niggas to fight the power
Igniting sour, watching Chowder in my finest hour
A clearer mix of acid jazz and blue grass
Niggas still stuck in the past, opening new scabs
Me and Wiz matching bottles nigga, open two tabs
Stumbling out with six models, my nigga order two cabs
We ain't worried bout rivals, them niggas too trash
Fuck what niggas think, I'm the illest one in the new class
And I don't give a fuck what niggas ain't fuckin' with
OFWG run with the team or suck a dick

[Chorus: Tyler, the Creator & Wiz Khalifa]
Go, I'm so fuckin loaded
Pockets and the smoke and all the bitches
Tell em
Go, faded and I'm floatin
I hope your lungs is open
All the bitches, tell em, go
Now I been around the world before
But I never thought it'd be this way
And I smoked up all this weed before
But I never thought it'd feel this way
And all the bitches be like, "Yeah"

[Bridge: Tyler, the Creator]
Guitars sound like some Kill Bill shit, watch it
That's that church tambourine shit
My grandma used to play that
Nigga
Golf Wang

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
(Turn up) Yessir
I got old money, I got new money
Put 'em together, I got huge money
Bank teller call my phone, she tell me I'm putting on
Twenty years of success, let's toast to the best
Sip on some ace then I pour out the rest
Fuck bitches, get ends
Drink gin, fuck their friends
Juicy J three hoes in a white on white Benz
I stay sipping codeine
Blue dream I'm rolling up
Looking for a bitch with bank statements like Oprah
These black diamonds racist, Louis V no laces
My plug on call coming straight up out the basement
All I know is money, it don't look like you
One shot from the chopper make you look like two

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Chorus]
Boy, you got me freaking out
You got me spinning round tonight
Round, and round, and round, round
Boy, it's like a rodeo
We're on a rollercoaster ride
Round, and round, and round, round

[Verse 1]
Blew up like dynamite
Second you caught my eye
You've been playing
On my mind, on my mind 24/7 for you
Said goodbye, said goodbye, but I'm still thinkin' 'bout you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sitting here and checkin' my phone
My friends all think I'm crazy
Wondering, anticipating, do you feel the same?
If we both stop playing it cool this shit could be amazing
Let's get out of here, and we could make it real

[Chorus]
Boy, you got me freaking out
You got me spinning round tonight
Round, and round, and round, round
Boy, it's like a rodeo

You were so beautiful
Standing there on your own
Got that connection
Butterflies, butterflies, I got these feelings for you
If I die, if I die, I'll still be dreamin' of you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Hangin' here with you on my arm, I got the sweetest candy
Confident and serious, I know you feel the same, oh
Don't need to be playing it cool 'cause this shit is amazing
Sign your name right here
Baby, let's seal the deal

[Chorus]
Boy, you got me freaking out
You got me spinning round tonight
Round, and round, and round, round (and round)
Boy, it's like a rodeo
We're on a rollercoaster ride
Round, and round, and round, round

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
What, wha, wha, what, what's it all about
It's the bodega cat and I'm back in the house
Nick, nack, paddy-wack, fuck your dog bone
I'm mobbin' with my cats, we relax on the throne
Which is on top of a bunch of potatoes
Lil' fine kitty lay on the top of the tomatoes
Fat pussy cat with a booty like J-Lo's
Body straight from heaven, God gave her a halo
Can of tuna fish, went straight to my navel
Now I got the itis and a cut like fredo
Man I hate rats always eating up the bagels
I say "hi hater," shoutouts to Mano
Kanye walked in to pick up some rice
Guess who popped out, it was a talking mice
He said "hey you, wake up Mr. West, I know you fly but damn it I'm blessed"

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg ]
What, wha, wha, what, what's it all about
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, meow
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, meow
It's the bodega cat and I'm back in ya house
What, wha, wha, what, what's it all about
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, meow
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma meow
It's the uptown cat and I'm back up in the house

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
It's the jiggy-cat burglars
Fuck your hamburger bruh
Fuck your grandmother up
Rips on your furniture
Ghetto brain like she went to Herkimer
She give me head till I shed (naughty kitty)
Trill cat shit, take a cat nap after cat nip
Make her pussy take a cat scan
Fuck a cat fish in my mattress
That shit in in the bread aisle
That's where I lay my head
That's my bed now
Good riddance it's the bodega kittens
I'm the youngest of my siblings
Beat my dick with my mittens
You say beef, I say chickens
I don't really know the difference
Ask me what my favourite dish is
Either pussy or the fishes
Pussy, pussy or the fishes
Ye, yeah, its either pussy or the fishes

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg ]
What, wha, wha, what, what's it all about
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, meow
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, meow
It's the bodega cats and I'm back in ya house
What, wha, wha, what, what's it all about
Ma, ma, ma, ma, meow
Ma, ma, ma, ma, meow
It's the uptown cat and I'm back up in the house

*meow*

[Chorus: 070 Shake]
Saturday night, you call me when you're drunk
Don't even try, you'll never touch my soul
She made the cut, shawty is a pro
Never any love, you do it for the show
I'm 'bout to hit the road, the road

I'm 'bout to hit the road, the road
She do it for the show, I didn't even know
Ooh, Sunday night

[Verse 1: 070 Shake]
Hit the lights I'm coming, sorry for the wait
I popped a tab and then my life turned to a maze
You just need to feel the pain, then maybe you'd be amazed
How in a blink it goes away, then you'll see that I'm not crazy
Maybe you'll see, maybe, nothing never faze me
I was clean a long long long long time ago
They fall one by one like a motherfucking domino
They tell you what to do like it is Simon says
Get this money chase it, she just wants the diamonds'
Rollies, Rollies, Rollies, Rollies
I do not have time for this, why do you come for me
I know you don't wanna see, some things, its just hard to believe
Till you breathe, soak it in, let it drip, smell the trees
Pour it up, don't ever leave, me alone with the piece
I might just pull, I might just cease to exist, like I'm Steez
Rest in peace, can you feel the fucking beat, beat, beat
We ain't looking for the peace, peace, peace
I stick the finger to the dean, dean, dean
I stick the finger to the dean, dean, dean
I stick the finger to the dean, dean, dean
I do not care bout what you think, think, think
I get my money like I'm Meng Meng Meng

[Chorus: 070 Shake]
Sunday night, you call me when you're drunk
Don't even try, you'll never touch my soul
She made the cut, shawty is a pro
Never any love, you do it for the show
I'm 'bout to hit the road, hit the road
I'm 'bout to hit the road, the road
I'm 'bout to hit the road, the road
Ooh, Sunday night

[Verse 2: 070 Phi]
With the squad going hard in this bitch
We ain't never gone call it for quits
Stand tall, never fall, never slip, get a grip
Count it up, make it flip, and then ball in this bitch
I just feel like I deserve, everything that I earn
Even when its a loss, its something for me to learn
Story to tell, reason to toast
I've been through hell, swear its the most
Now I'm just feeling like I'm winning
All in the cameras I be grinning, young nigga chilling like a villain
Stack it until it hit the ceiling, then get a crib with bigger rooms
And find another way to fill in
That's just the life, that's just the way that we living
Challenge the way of the system, she tryna balance the taste of the liquor
She know that we'll never be us again
She know I'm focused on me as a man
I'll never change, I'm still the same
And that's just something you can never manage
I know you hate how you ain't do no damage on me yea yea

[Bridge: 070 Shake & 070 Phi]
Don't have no time to have you all up on my mind yeah
You always looking and I know I'm hard to find yeah
You know I meant it when I said this shit is mine yeah
Nothing to lose, I got this all up on the line

[Chorus: 070 Shake & 070 Phi]
Saturday night, you call me when you're drunk
Don't even try, you'll never touch my soul
She made the cut, shawty is a pro
Never any love, you do it for the show

I'm 'bout to hit the road, the road
I'm 'bout to hit the road, the road
She do it for the show, I didn't even know
Sunday night, you call me when you're drunk
Don't even try, you'll never touch my soul
She made the cut, shawty is a pro
Never any love, you do it for the show
Sunday night

[Verse 1: You're Not Sorry]
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long baby but I figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around

[Chorus: You're Not Sorry]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no

[Verse 2: You're Not Sorry]
You're looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you didn't leave me waiting in the cold
You've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
'Cause it's worked each time before

[Chorus: You're Not Sorry]
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry, no
You're not sorry, no

[Bridge: You're Not Sorry]
You had me crawling for you, honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

[Pre-Chorus: What Goes Around.../...Comes Around]
Don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
I'm so confused about it 
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
Won't you tell me, is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you go around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's okay, baby
'Cause in time you will find

[Chorus: What Goes Around.../...Comes Around]
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around 
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around 
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around

[Chorus: You're Not Sorry]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Outro: What Goes Around.../...Comes Around (Bridge)]

Just a slow down small town
Just a deep south home crowd
With nothing to do and nothing to lose
The same old paper and same old news

We'd ride around 10:30 on a Friday
We'd hurry to a parkin lot
With all our friends
Turning up the heat when
We finally made it to the weekend

We put the gas to the floor
Yeah, we hit it wide open
Two-lane highway rolling
With no one around, slowing us down
Radio loud, had the speakers all blowing
Dials wide open
Feet on the dash with her hand out the window
Smiling a look in her eye letting me know
She didn't care where we were going
As long as we were going wide open
She was made for the fast lane
She was more than just a pretty face
First time lover, we spent that summer
Doing nothing but getting away

We put the gas to the floor
Yeah, we hit it wide open
Two-lane highway rolling
With no one around, slowing us down
Radio loud, had the speakers all blowing
Dials wide open
Feet on the dash with her hand out the window
Smiling a look in her eye letting me know
She didn't care where we were going
As long as we were going wide open

We put the gas to the floor
Yeah, we hit it wide open
Two-lane highway rolling
With no one around, slowing us down
Radio loud, had the speakers all blowing
Dials wide open
Feet on the dash with her hand out the window
Smiling a look in her eye letting me know
She didn't care where we were going
As long as we were going wide open
(Just a slow down small town)
Wide open
(Just a deep south home crowd)
She didn't care where we were going
As long as we were going wide open
Wide open
While silent sky keeps birds
You 're going through my eyes
While the water floats Now
I dream about your hair
I think I walk
But I'm not sure
I do not know whether I'm singing
Or when I cry wolf
Whether I'm alive
I do not know
Because you are my golden age
You're my air
While silent sky keeps birds
You 're going through my eyes
While the water floats Now
I dream about your hair
I think I walk
But I'm not sure
I do not know whether I'm singing
Or when I cry wolf
Whether I'm alive
I do not know
Because you are my golden age
You're my air
You are you
You are you
You are my big time
You know that i love you

When I was younger Mama told me that
She wanna live in Texas (Texas!)
Had a lot of trouble in the city
It was getting too hectic
Cyphers in the school skipping class and
We always acting reckless
Had a teacher always said I wasn't shit
Now she wanna send a message
Talking 'bout remember all the old days
Talking 'bout remember all the lessons
To be honest, I don't remember
I left my past in December
Live in the clouds with the embers
Mix it all up like a blender
You can't drink you ain't a member
Please excuse my temper
Shawty straight but I had to bend her
You don't wanna see us on the dance floor
If you ain't getting lit then you can't come
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 070, so a snitch ain't one
Shorty wanna chase but I'm on the run
See the colors drippin' down your throat
And I appreciate you so much more
Cause you look even better
You look even better than you usually do
I think I'm gettin' used to you
Cause she looks even better, better, better
Than the regu-regu-regular

Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, nigga, please don't touch (Don't touch)
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And, it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

[Verse 2]
So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought, that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
'Cause you was untrue
Rollin' her 'round in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

[Chorus]
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I will have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable (Irreplaceable)

[Bridge]
So since I'm not your everything (Irreplaceable)
How about I'll be nothing (Nothing)
Nothing at all to you (Nothing)
Baby, I won't shed a tear for you (I won't shed a tear)
I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you was so easy

[Interlude]
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Mmm
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

[Chorus]
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You must not know 'bout me (Baby, yeah)
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute
You can pack all your bags, we're finished
(You must not know 'bout me)
'Cause you made your bed, now lay in it
(You must not know 'bout me)
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable
Transcribing

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg & Jobba Loc]
Crip since I was born, flip dip in the foreign
20 crip to the fullest I could never transform
Fuck with the real while I'm holding the whip
Shot some chips to the crips so they can beat the appeal
Keep the crip on mind I gotta feed my Dogg's
From State to Wayside I got niggas in bars

[Verse 1: Lil Yatchy]
She said "I can't fuck with him, he way too picky"
I just spilled a pint of lean on all my Dickies
I got 30 bitches in the Appalachians
Mountain, as the time ticks, they acting weirder
Check my tag, the numbers count on all my sweaters
Boy, that's Margiela
Nigga you know you ain't counting cheddar
Ask your baby girl who fuck her better
Bitch it's 20-15, it's Trick Daddy
Whippin' niggas like the slave master
20 karats in my left wrist, I'm a youth pastor
Sliding down your city real slow
Braids out with the rare 'fro
With the platinum teeth, nigga good grief
When a nigga smile all you see is bling
Chef Master when I start up beef
Got these niggas hating cause I mm, damn
Niggas hating cause I'm flexing harder
Quick to run it up like Tiki Barber
Chopper make a nigga think smarter
Chopper make a nigga second guess
Is this nigga here really my nigga, or am I just trying hard to impress?
Hmm, now he thinking
Diamonds sparkle got these niggas blinking
Chardo-Sunday nights, momma drinking
Demon soul inside a holy heaven

[Verse 2: Soop]
I'm in this ditch like a camper
Creeping, late night in I'm a vamper
Don't let my young boys attack you
I'm with that shit like a pamper
They say that they trick but I'm Damper
When I'm in that bed it ain't Tamper
These niggas be creeping like cancer
She jump on my pole like a lancer
I'm red-on-red look like I'm Prancer
Dib and dabbing in the London cabbie, boy that yappa-chopper started thunder clapping
Nigga rah-rah like a dungeon dragon
And a cra-cra if you think you capping
But my 'migos stamping me a newer package
I'ma ship it over to an Egypt palace
Sippin' lean out a golden chalice
While he looking like a fucking salad
You could see the karats in the band of children
I'm across the water looking like a pilgrim
Money, money, what an open feeling
Y'all been watching looking like a thriller
Always street-whippin' looking like I'm Tigger
Boy that new thing looking like Shakira
And she give thanks like we in November

[Intro: Meek Mill]
I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more

Nigga still getting these hundreds, know I got all of these (all I want, all I need)

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Little bit of hood with a swag like Left Eye
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Pussy so good, want to put in a rap line
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
I put my face all up in it, get baptized (woo!)
Plus 5, plus 5, she was that fine, go to sleep all in it like nap time (woo! Oh Lord)
She woke up like this with her ass all on me from the backside
She want to do the surfboard, just tryna be like Beyoncé (surfboard)
And if she always do it this good then she might just be my fiancée (wife her)
I want more, I want more and now damn, I want yours
Thinking like how did we get on the floor?
From the couch to the bed when we came in the door
And I came from the door like

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Damn, look what you started
We done turned my crib into an after party
And all I really wanna do, all I really wanna do, hey

All a nigga want is you
Liquor got me stupid
Now, baby, tell me what you want to do, hey (all I want, all I need)

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Bridge: Chris Brown & (Meek Mill)]
I know that you fake niggas ain't real (ha, ain't real)
That's why we take your girls and make money, make money (get money)
A double cup and a whole bag of them pills (why?)
I hear them on the pole and they shake something, shake something (let's get it)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Damn, look what you started
We done turned my crib into an after party
And all I really wanna do, all I really wanna do, hey

Put cash in the bag, zips in the bag, lean in the bag
I keep the case in case a nigga want his skull cracked
My nigga Ashton told me to tell ya'll niggas he want his swag back

Whatever you do, wherever you go, just remember I got the bag

Maybe we could all get money and relate to each other
An OG told me
Real men get it, don't take from another
And don't wait on another
I don't need no favors
Man I'm straight with my brothers
Love to drink with my brothers
Get to the bank with my brothers
Young nigga coming out straight from the gutter
Know that it's about the bread and the butter
But all I'm seeing is guns and them roses
Why do my people keep losing our soldiers
We 'posed to get it and spread out the culture
Boss up my nigga and live like a owner
This for my niggas that's setting they goals up
I can't wait til we go up
This is just the beginning
Stay to myself because nigga we winning
But I got love for my niggas that's getting it
I do not move with no malice
Trynna keep all of my balance
Sometimes it could be a challenge
I'm racking up on the mileage
I've been so long on this road
So far from home
I'm just a young Rolling Stone
Started with nothing
I made them decisions
How could you hate this persistence
I mean we came from a distance
Gotta be free and maintain on the mission
If they ain't talking that mean they ain't listening
All of my niggas is focused and ready to get it
You know we ain't lacking and slippin'
We on it and winnin'
And all of you niggas gon' feel it

Man I'm really feeling low right now
And she thinking 'bout the stove I know
I love the distraction
Destruction
Dysfunction
Erupting
I'm running from something so cunning
It's nothing
I'm bugging me to take my luggage
And leave out the country like Paris
It's stunning
I know I would love it
So neat it'd be numbing
I ask you don't bug me, yeahh
I ask you don't bug me, yeahh
Can you just respect the fact that I come and go
You got to accept the fact that you'll never know
We want to surprise them more so we lay low
So we lay low

Two diamonds on my mothafuckin' bezzler

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It's the billion kid, Gucci, we went half on a bank

He go hard in the paint, he got hard at the bank
Waka Flocka, Gucci Mane, I'm goin hard on the drinks
And I get pussy every day, I guess you is what you drank
Cause y'all pussycat is bigger than the diamonds in my rang
Who is I? done run off with the scrubs
Duck or neck, but you didn't share the love with the thugs
And the rap game paralyze the street life, I'm not sellin drugs
I'm, selling CD's globally, my Brinks truck pullin up
I get offers for a million dollars just to throw it up
I made two thundred thousand today I feel like throwin up
Gucci

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I got Hummer trucks, pullin up, but I'm buyin other trucks
Master P and Gucci Mane done pulled up in the wealth with our

Drop dead, I don't skate, froze up, we pullin up
Brinks... if you a real nigga link
Up, the bad nigga, Brinks

[Verse 2: Master P]
I'm 'bout to pull a Mike Vick on 'em dude
Get money, street boys; I love the kid
Iced green Peedy, I got the streets heated
I left a minute now I'm back the game really needs me
Gucci Mane called me, man I got that flipper
Everybody come and tryin to get in my hair for dipper
With that dola, trap boy, granolas
Brick Squad soldiers, gon' run 'til it's over
I had chills for a minute, still screamin No Limit
Had changed my life, dem fools thought I wasn't in it
Drumma B and we winnin; and y'all never done it
Tried to play the game but none of y'all never won it
Don't need to be replaced - I'm already a legend
From the streets to the hood to my little brother up in heaven
I'm a ghetto star

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I got Hummer trucks, pullin up, but I'm buyin other trucks
Master P and Gucci Mane done pulled up in the wealth with our

[Chorus: Bankroll Fresh]

Devil on my shoulder and he telling me to take it from ya

[Verse 1: Boyz II Men]
Your story sad to tell
A teenage ne'er do well
Most mixed up non-delinquent on the block
Your future's so unclear now
What's left of your career now?
Can't even get a trade in on your smile

[Interlude: Boyz II Men & Grease Live Cast]
(La la la la la la la la...)

[Verse 2: Boyz II Men]
Beauty school dropout
No graduation day for you
Beauty school dropout
Missed your midterms and flunked shampoo
Well at least you could have taken time
To wash and clean your clothes up
After spending all that dough to
Have the doctor fix your nose up

[Verse 3: Boyz II Men]
Baby, get moving (Baby, get moving)
Why keep your feeble hopes alive?
What are you proving? ( What are you proving?)
You've got the dream but not the drive
If you go for your diploma, you could join a sneto pool
Turn in your teasin' comb and go back to high school

[Interlude: Boyz II Men & Grease Live Cast]
(La la la la la la la la...)

[Verse 4: Boyz II Men & (Grease Live Cast)]
Beauty school dropout (Beauty school dropout)
Hanging around the corner store
Beauty school dropout (Beauty school dropout)
It's about time you knew the score
Well they couldn't teach you anything
You think you're such a looker
But no customer would go to you unless she was a hooker

[Verse 5: Boyz II Men]
Baby, don't sweat it (Don't sweat it)
You're not cut out to hold a job
Better forget it (Forget it)
Who wants their hair done by a slob?
Now your bangs are curled
Your lashes whirled
But still the world is cruel
Wipe off that angel face and go back to high school

[Verse 6: Boyz II Men & (Grease Live Cast)]
Baby, don't blow it (Baby, don't blow it)
Don't put my good advice to shame
Baby, you know it (Baby, you know it)
Even Dear Abby'd say the same!
Now I've called the shot, get off the block
We really gotta fly!
Gotta be going to that, malt shop, in the sky!

[Outro: Boyz II Men & (Grease Live Cast)]
Beauty school dropout (Beauty school dropout)
Go back to high school

Go back to high school

You and I are cut from different fabric

Some how this world is such a struggle just to be
Fuck em' all, baby, it's just you and me

Think I spent too much time on you
I rack my brain too many times at night
I bet I'm a breath of fresh air for another nigga
You finna make me go take care of another nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet it's easy
It get so easy to take the easy way out
No way out
They said "Easy
It must be easy to be you"
I say "how do you figure when you don't know me at all?"
At all, at all, at all
It doesn't matter anyway, ooh
And nowadays, I don't know you and never could tell if it matters anyway
I'm sure you got it all figured out
And you confident in yourself

[Chorus]
Well I'm tired of being on the outside baby
How can I come on the inside babe?
It looks like you're good and you got it all
All figured out all by yourself
Well I'm tryna be on the inside baby
How can I come on the inside baby?

[Post-Chorus]
I might be thirsty for you
How can you blame me?
Oh I might be thirsty for you
How can you blame me?
Oh I might play circus for you
How do you want me?
I conjure up that coochie for you
Voodoo, Houdini
And I might be that hoochie for you
Ever you need me to get in between your guidelines
And I slide right in
You could read in between my guidelines
And you fit right in

[Pre-Chorus]
So easy
It get so easy to take the easy way out
No way out
They said "Easy
It must be easy to be you"
I say "how do you figure when you don't know me at all?"
At all, at all, at all
It doesn't matter anyway, ooh
Nowadays, I don't know
You never can tell if it really mattered anyway
Anyway, anyway
I'm sure you got it all figured out
And you confident in yourself

[Chorus]
Well I'm tired of being on the outside baby
How can I come on the inside babe?

Call a Uber, Uber cause I'm a scuba

Coach seats to private, I'm coast to coast, ballin'
Call your friends, the weekend's coming

Give me one for the money, you the one for the night
Girl, you one in a million if you the one that I like
You got a lot of booty, booty
Glad I knew ya, I brought a ruler

[Intro]
I'm comin' back
Hey, yeah, I'm comin'
I'm comin' back
Hey, yeah, I'm comin'

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
It's a cold world, baby, but I'm a cold nigga
Frostbite tryna take a chew of how I slither
My presence give 'em chills, like an Antarctican winter
And I'm bangin' Inglewood 'til I'm gettin' caught with a splinter
I'm havin' artists for dinner
So many fall apart when I spark, it's hard to remember
It's always hard rememberin' pain is part of the riddle
Somewhere between my art and the dark, I'm parked in the middle
I knew my part since was little
I knew my heart was official
I knew that in my heart that that boy was part of a bigger plan
I know my momma not comin' up short of rent again
'Cause I put this rap shit down and go and sin again
Fuck all the daps and pounds, I'm on my shit again
All that bad mouthin' just runnin' up my adrenaline
And yeah, it's safe to say we made a way
From gettin' slouched on
And Doms'll be that nigga from now on, you dig me?

[Chorus: Mac Miller, with Domo Genesis]
Nothin' to do 'cept smoke and drive (Smoke and drive)
Twenty in your pocket, million on your mind (On your mind)
And someone had the drink, someone had the drugs
Someone had bitches on the line, that's just what it was (What it was)
And I don't regret a single night I came home fucked up
Ain't sorry for a single time I made hoes cry
Money was a thing I didn't make too much of
Tell me "Hurry up," I'ma take my time (My time)

[Bridge: Domo Genesis]
I feel like I'm designed for this
I don't know how on my timin' is
But I know I won't have time again
To give this all I got, ayy

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
All my clouds got silver linings
Amazin' how I keep my peace alive through all this violence
It's a war outside my window, it's like all I hear is sirens
But it's somethin' 'bout the melody, I'm driftin' into science
I was born hateful, lookin' at this world ugly
Way at the bottom, got me questionin' if God love me
You know my steez dog, real niggas ride gully
Lost a couple soldiers, got me smokin' with my eyes runny
My heart cold like I said in the first verse
And I'm tryna eat, you niggas eyein' dessert first
And somewhere between the hoes and money, I got hurt the worst
I swear to God this life a gift and a curse
My path was chosen way before I existed, the misfit
The voices in my head never tell me wrong, so I listen
Either make a way or collision
I ain't here to play, nigga, I'm on a mission

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Nothin' to do 'cept smoke and drive (I hear that) (Smoke and drive)
Twenty in your pocket, million on your mind (On your mind)
And someone had the drink, someone had the drugs
Someone had bitches on the line, that's just what it was (What it was)
And I don't regret a single night I came home fucked up
Ain't sorry for a single time I made hoes cry
Money was a thing I didn't make too much of
Tell me "Hurry up," I'ma take my time (My time)

[Outro: Mac Miller]
La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
I wake up every morning, bless the herb and
Say a prayer to thank the Lord for my purpose
Today could be my day but that ain't making me nervous
I'm saying, worrying worthless
I'm worth waking up the Devil, pay with proof of his purchase
Even when days was darker and it was harder to breathe
I embraced it, flourished, though it's hard to believe
Stayed on the bench to see the starters recede
And now I'm calling shots, star in this league, like Moses parting the seas
Learned how to swim when I was drowning, no help, y'know
When they doubted, I was 'bout it myself, you know
Gotta swing short handed, yeah, lucky us
Born in debt, yet I won't let them commas fuck me up
Life ain't your bitch, she just a buddy fuck
A quick pump, now I'm trying chase that bitch with a muddy cup
Funny how time flies when you coming up
And I'm just me hoping I done enough

[Chorus: JMSN]
Had to do everything on my own
Can't expect you to understand
Everything, everything that I know
But I'm doing the best I can

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
I'm out, no doubt, for the power and money
And I might crack a smile, but it ain't shit funny
And you niggas can't take shit from me
When it's fire, I be icy
And hot when it ain't shit sunny
I feel amazing, feeling rewarded 'cause of my anguish
Just waiting for the day I can fade away in the vanquish
For now I got my dues and I'm scraping cakes for the payment
Who knew one display of mistakes was making me famous, huh?
My confidence powers itself
Shit I been getting dollars if knowledge is wealth
The way to figure out the world is with knowledge itself
And with that knowledge I just went out and got it myself
So I ...
I ...
I ...

[Chorus: JMSN]
Had to do everything on my own
Can't expect you to understand
Everything, everything that I know
But I'm doing the best I can

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, no

[Verse: Domo Genesis]
I mean really what am I to do?
Okay, these words to my momma, I promised to not to lose
A born sinner, still playing like I forgot the moves
Dancing to this drum in my heart, this is such an awkward groove
No fam, really niggas ain't ready they sleep
While they wake I play that crickets, send out some blessings from me
No more stressing baby we don't smoke nothing less then a G
A hundred grand, a million dollar mind state
A couple goons on call, in case they got to boost the crime rate
America ain't never really tell me how that pot tastes
I'm looking for my destiny, take me on a blind date
Six figures making sure my mom's straight
Whole clique stepping out on point looks like it's prom date
Came a long way from getting paid doing that not say
Invested in my motherfucking self and now my stock raised
Knowing niggas steady getting guap, say
Look at me now
I got knowledge for every dollar made, so look at me now
I ain't scared of none of my flaws, that got 'em shook of me now
So if you ever had a doubt about it, it shouldn't be now (Nah)
I got 'em shook of me now
So if you ever had a doubt about it, it shouldn't be now

[Hook: Samantha Nelson & Carmel Echols]
I can't keep sitting here waiting around
Sink my feet under the ground
Keep my head under the clouds
You got to be lost where you found
I can't keep sitting here waiting around
Sink my feet under the ground
Keep my head under the clouds
You got to be lost where you found

[Outro: Samantha Nelson & Carmel Echols]
Mhhh (x8)
Yeah

[Intro: Domo's Mom]
When I talk about my son
I get overjoyed with emotion
But I feel empowered
Because, I tell you
When I first looked into his eyes
I knew he would be something special
He was so bright and so funny at the same time
I said there would be a day
When I would share him with the world
I just didn't know when
And that day has come, it's now
And I couldn't be more happy for him
I'm so proud
He's something special and I'm glad
He's getting a chance to show you what he is
Because I saw it a long time ago
I got you, no matter what
I'm there for you
And, um no matter what obstacles come your way
Always remember that you are gonna be you
And no one else can take that away from you
Remember that the stars and the sky is the limit
And once you reach those, you keep going
Just keep going and never look back
Because it belongs to you, it's your time
And I would always say that to you
Just always reach for the stars
So, I want you to know that I'm always gonna be
The wind underneath your wings
I'm gonna be the water underneath your bridge
I'm gonna be the bullet in your Glock
If you know what I mean
That means that I just got you, no matter what
So reach for the stars, as I always tell you
Spread your wings and sore
Bye-bye baby boy, time for lift off

[Interlude: Domo Genesis]
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Still floating through the city like my uncle's ghost
Give him a glimpse of who they love the most
I'm blunted, whoever they wanted, I ain't running over nothing
The blood that my heart is pumping is one below
We play this game, no one has repercussions
Took some losses, see where I faltered
And learned some lessons from it
My momma say I must be blessed or something
The same gift that got me paper, I be stressing from it
Remember jumping in cribs, thinking what drawn in rims
It wasn't all BT but this is just how I live
See, Imma take all of mines, if they got nothing to give
Cause lack of inspiration had me chasing broken ideas
See, I was aggravated, blind pacing my mind unaware
That being lost would be the place I would find my ideas
I was a shoe fit, lucrative, new little nigga
I been through the blues groove
What couldn't you do to a nigga?
From what we had, this looks beautiful, nigga
If we had the end of day, I'd ask Krit to save room for a nigga
My life story gotta be worth somebody's time
This much weed, I need to breathe
Keeping my lungs on the line
Don't kill the vibe, I just begun to unwind
If they won't let me free my mind, then fuck it
I be comfortable dying
This hustle, only thing I knew from the start
All alone, singing this song in my heart

[Hook]
I feel so lost, yeah
I feel so lost (I feel so lost)
We are so far (we are so far)
We got so far to go
I feel so lost
I feel so lost
I feel so lost
We got so far to go
We are so far
We are so far
We got so far (I feel so lost)
I feel so lost

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
And I wear my heart on my sleeves
It's been a while since I felt like I was part of a team
I feel like so apart, just trying to stay a part of this league
He weather heavy pressure, y'all fall apart at the seams from
I see why my grandfather drinking, that Seagram's
Cause life ain't easy, remember momma had to scream it
And caught two buses to take her son
To get the teachers, then hopped on another to graduate
There's some seeing some
House, still working job, fortunate we eating
So telling me I can't? Fuck him, I can't believe it
Cause I never thought a million years
Would bring us to this region
Lost a couple, want to rob but my focus still on the leading
Never caught me finding me, what distances me from the team, shit
And no matter what we've grow through, I love you dudes
I mean it
Smoking on that green, cause the path ain't always scenic
Learn from where I lack at, cause nobody's a genius
It's just some shit you gotta say, I'll break your heart in pieces
Trying to bottle it, call my own path, I don't follow shit
So far to go and feeling out of it
If this what comes from being lost, then I'm proud of it

[Outro]
Oh, oh
I feel so lost
Why we gotta go so far?
Why we gotta go so far?
Hey
Why we gotta go so far?
Oh, oh
Hey, hey, hey
Got so got got g- got so far to go
Hey

[Intro: Domo]
(Na na na nanana)

[Hook: Domo]
If you don’t like this song, then go and turn my lights off
I count all my blessings cause I know that karma won’t bite soft
It ain’t too wrong and its timing now, and I know enough to do right, y’all
I hope I shine a new light, y’all, ain't felt this strong in my life, y’all
I sleep and dream about it all night, all night, all night (all night)
I sleep and dream about it all night, all night, all night (all night)

[Verse 1: Domo]
Tell me what it takes, I ain’t waiting around look into a certain face
And uh, they give me space, never get a replace
They gave haste till I paved the way, you can’t relate to this
Surviving on my grounds is dangerous, and despite all the doubt I still take the risk
Why most young niggas thinking that it can’t exist? I just feel it it's my time I can’t shake the shit
Young running up roach clips with thug niggas, pop's in jail should’ve turned into a drug dealer
Late nineties I was still learning what it was nigga, used to be alone until I learned to be in love with it
Still, I was never lead astray, I know I’ll see a better day
And every night I lay, I still had the same dream as the other day
Lord, listen to my Mother pray, goddamn

[Hook]
If you don’t like this song, then go and turn my lights off (my lights off)
I count all my blessings cause I know that karma won’t bite soft (know that karma won’t bite soft)
It ain’t too wrong, and its timing now, and I know enough to do right y’all (do right y’all)
I hope I shine a new light, y’all, ain’t felt this strong in my life, y’all (all night)
I sleep and dream about it all night, (all night), all night, (all night), all night, all night, (all night)
(all night), I sleep and dream about it all night, all night, all night, (all night), (all night), (all night)

[Verse 2: Domo]
Shit, I don’t complain about nothing, dog, I just take my pain and write mad shit
My plan is to come up from nothing and just act like I never had shit
I’m looking in the mirror right now, looking just like my dad did
But I promise y’all if I do one thing, I won't miss the steps my dad did
I’m still screaming “fuck them all”, I’ve become the man that I wanted to
They pray to god that I won’t evolve, but I transform right in front of you
If I die today, just judge me by all my statements, y’all, tell them that I was never afraid at all
I’ve seen the greatest falls, but still I stayed involved, sitting up late getting faded on

[Outro: King Chip]
On and on
I dream about that shit all night, my nigga (all night)
I dream about that shit all night (all night)
I dream about that shit all night, my nigga (all night)
I dream about that shit all night (all night)
I dream about that shit all night, my nigga (all night)
I dream about that shit all night (all night)
I dream about that shit all night, my nigga (all night)
I dream about that shit all night
(I’m really about that shit, I’m really about that shit, I’m really bout that shit, oh)
(I’m really about that shit, I’m really about that shit, I’m really bout that shit, oh)

[Verse: Domo Genesis]
I can see the world in your eyes
That's what I told the mirror man, this world full of lies
I'm just starting to see it clearer now
My experiences has grown to make me feel this now
Starting to lose all the doubt I had inside of my spirit now
Maybe I'm dying for this life
All this madness in hindsight is inspiring what I write
Maybe I'm just a fly, getting blinded by this light
Renew my new song like
Cause I can finally buy the price
Maybe quittin', I would hate to say
For the times it wasn't there we had to make a way
Struggle gave me dreams that never take away
Maybe it's a dream that I'm in day to day (Loosely living life)
Or maybe I'm just faded, man, ay

[Hook: Tay Walker]
Maybe I'm loopy
Maybe I'm stupid
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm going out my mind
Loosely living life
Maybe I'm loco
Maybe I don't know
Exactly what I want
I'll have it before I say goodbye
Just loosely living life
Yeah

[Bridge]
Every time I close my eyes
I end up in the Summer skies
Flying over paradise
Yeah, and every time I go to sleep
I end up in a lucid dream
I can do any, I can do anything

And maybe I'm stupid

[Outro]
Sometimes when I wake up
I think - uh-uh
I sit up and wonder
*rambling* every body under
Sometimes when I wake up
I sit up and wonder
Anyone out there
Anyone ever tell about me
*rambling*
Sometimes when I wake up

Let me try that one more time
Can I just listen to it though?
(Sometimes when I wake up, I sit up and wonder)

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Am I dreaming now, I can't tell the difference
Is this mission God-sent or is it sacrilegious
Am I running from the past or am I backwards sprinting
Can I blast out all this sleep and just get back to living
In my war, will God hate me for these rash decisions
Or will he save me, know in my heart through this path I'm given
I got so many questions but who am I asking, nigga
I ask myself, what is it you really after, nigga
Is it money, is it bitches, is it fame
Is it pursuit of happiness if everybody knows your name
Does this weed keep me from going clinically insane
Are you really even living this image up in this game
But what is you really saying
You ain't really saving souls, is you
You from nothing fam, you really think it's gold in you
Are you built to keep that spirit in your soul with you
Will you stick to it even if they don't roll with you
I got questions

[Hook: Kendra Foster]
Just when you thought this life was just for your fun
There's something there to tell you that you ain't done
So I've got a lot of questions
Cursing that you're on a mission, oh

[Verse 2: Da$H]
Just another dead man breathing
Burnt out heathen sipping syrup every week
Doing powder every evening, popping pills to keep me even
Since a nigga left school seems it's death that I'm cheating
So I'm speeding, fuck slow is
Catch me anywhere the dough is
Nowadays it's anywhere a show is
Same 

[?], call me, asking where a O is
If you talking 'bout the edge, shit, I'm dancing on the closest
If you talking 'bout showbiz, I don't know shit about it
Start to fight, these other niggas crowd around it
The rap game got me questioning my surroundings
I got issues so I'm counsoling with the ounces
My lump of problems seem to turned into a mountain
Money in the mattress, never spoke to no accountant
Nigga, all this finessing, God gave me a blessing
Make it to Hell before me then just tell the devil I got questions

[Hook: Kendra Foster]
Just when you thought this life was just for your fun
There's something there to tell you that you ain't done
So I've got a lot of questions
Cursing that you're on a mission, oh

[Verse 3: Domo Genesis]
What's worse, fake smiles or not smiling at all
You risk it all, asking if you hit the ground if you fall
What if they don't love your dream and ain't astounded at all
And when they say you'll never make it, will you doubt it at all
You ain't ashamed to public answer to that drum in your heart
Are you afraid to bring to light, what you've done in the dark
Are you embracing what's becoming your part
Are you complacent, can you face personal pain just for the love of the art
I hope that you ain't let your momma down
You wish that you was back in college now
Do you feel dumb from all that knowledge now
We bout them digits, yeah them commas now
You wish you had some solids now
Will they still love you if you not around
Now are you using all your intellect, I mean no disrespect
But are you capable to be they interest
Are you afraid to let your dreams and life intersect
I wanna know man, I ain't finished yet
I got questions

[Bridge: Kendra Foster]
Don't stop, keep on living
Can't stop, we ain't risen
Wake up, check your vision
Play until your time's up (I got questions)
Give until your time's up (I got questions)

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah (multiple times)

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Girl, I know you feeling this energy
Hundred miles away and I still remember it vividly, I just pictured the imagery, we
Are just so small in this picture of life, belittles me, it's
A natural high off of these feelings you been giving me, but
I pray for feelings this good, forever-ever
Forever-ever-ever, and never tear it apart
It's kinetic, as long as we at it, we sharing a heart
Paint your picture from afar, cause together I feel it's art
As we, take it slow, babe I hoping you get these messages, cause
I'm already got me feeling R. Kelly, it's you
Killing me softly while I'm speaking it's all evidence
Got a hard nigga contemplating 'bout benevolence, but
I played my role right...
Cause I been dreaming of this shit my whole life
Seeing glimpses of the future and it's so bright
C-4 on the stove, and a coal fight, that's what we explode like
Uh

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah

[Verse 2: Domo Genesis]
Word to Omarion, I had an icebox where my heart at
And shawty lit a fire and I ain't know where to start at
I need to know what to call that at like a phoenix rising out the ashes
Like packed arenas with my music blasting
Like roller coasters, you screaming
All my love, you say you need it faster
Make golden moments then get weeded after
Got me faded on a feeling, oh so strong, hope that I don't get jaded, on
This melody you singing, me, I carry a cadence on
It's us, bet we ready for whatever any weather brings
We came from nothing, want to be somebody's everything
Bonds over tied us, don't need anything, set your screen
Just 1-on-1, check it up, I give you the best of me
Baby we balling, said you won't catch a player slip
But maybe I'm falling, maybe I'm all up in the zone
Maybe that's why my text-es is clogging up your phone
This love is honestly too hard to leave alone, uh

[Interlude 2]
Uh
Yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, uh 

[x3]
Yeah, yeah, uh
Yeah

[Verse 3: Cam O'Bi]
You and me, cuh, we're faded in the uh
Yeah...
Yeah! yeah
You and me, go, doing the thing, tuh
Oh... yeah! Cuh
You and me, cuh, we're faded in the morning, yeah

I swear I'll find a better worth for why I am I alive
It's about time that I'm seeing my stars align

[Verse 1]
Back in the hood just looking out the window
Staring at the moon somehow make all my problems little
I don't know why life is hard I guess it's all a riddle
To keep it real I haven't solved it but it's all official
I grow a little from day-to-day wish to stay the same
But you ain't really out here growing unless you making change
You selling out you out here hoein' I just play my lane
And bitches out here smoking Jane and it's a blazing chain

Ain't no love for the other side
And fuck them other niggas cause you know I'm down for mine
I know I lose a couple of them slacking down the line
The Inglewood is crazy hope I make it out in time
Just trust your dreams I never doubted mine
I run and pace, you run in  place, your shit is basic
I hunt for the front of the line we all be switching places
I'm running hot like a box you opted for ventilation
Straight to the top cause you ain't stopping all this insulation
Account me gaining hoping all the time they fed me hatred
Now I'm back to fuck the world feel the penetration
I'm so sorry for the wait I also grew impatient
I'm loving life, we blooming in with new relations
I'm here facing all this marijuan (marijuan)
Oh yeah I'm gonna keep on shining light a mine
Replacing all the lows smoking higher times
Flying out my mind penning all this time in rhymes

Intertwine inside then hold tight never let it loose, wet it up
Couple girls, couple stories, and a couple shrooms

[Intro: Big Sean + Jhene Aiko]
I swear this life was made for us
All these late nights is made for us
Tell the old ones please pray for us
Tell 'em this Sunday to pray for us
I swear this life was made for us
No such thing as getting paid too much
Going all night, please pray for us
Going all night, please pray for us

[Hook: Big Sean]
I guess I gotta get my shit together
I guess, I gotta get it
I guess it's do or die now huh
I guess I'm at the age that I can't try now huh
I guess, I guess, I guess so
I ain't gotta guess no more, I mean
I mean I'm at the age that I can't even try no more
I mean we gotta do it, it ain't even do or die no more

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I woke up early nigga
I had a dream I died at thirty nigga
Aw, twenty something doing real life
To make a million dollars, what it feel like?
It feel like I need to know her right then
It feel like young Ray Allen with the white twins
Popping harder than MJ with the white skin
I take you way back, I'm talking Tommy Hilfiger
Wave cap, way back
Back when we said we need the wrist rocky, ASAP
I had the Casio, time to replace that
Don't make me snap back, back to the TI$A  snapback
Khaled with the flow, you know, they don't want you to snap, yep
Don't make me get the car seat, niggas know I'm they pap, pap
Boy they owe it to me like Leonardo DiCap, facts, yep
Look fresh out of debt, getting spoiled rich
And I'm just tryna spend it all with a loyal bitch
I been choosing wrong girls my whole life
I hope I don't fail the test again
And have her going through my texts again
Religiously, like it's the old testament
Then end up single alone, and stressed again, saying...

[Hook: Big Sean]
I guess I gotta get my shit together
I guess, I guess I gotta get it
I guess it's do or die now huh
I guess I'm at the age that I can't try now huh
I guess, I guess, I guess so
I ain't gotta guess no more, I mean
I mean I'm at the age that we can't try no more
I mean we gotta do it, it ain't even do or die no more

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, thinking to my self what true success is
To some it's to get a job, retire, and move to Texas
I take the path less travelled and give them new directions
I'm still taking more risks than I do suggestions
When I was young I was addicted to the Wrestlemania
Maybe cause I had my back against the ropes
And I grew up Stone Cold just ready to face the Undertaker
I treat my enemies like fuckin' neighbors
Yeah you can borrow the style, and this and that for a while
But trust, I'll be back to fuckin' take it
Then take it back to before it all started adding up
Back when it was happening but wasn't happening fast enough
And the job applications was the only papers stackin' up
And we was contemplating black-masking out the back of trucks, yup
Do you know how it feel, to have no chill?
And love super thick girls with a supermodel feel
And try and do it bigger than everyone around you ever did and ever will
Then put it in your will
It ain't about where you at, boy, it's about where your mind's at
Got my first job and realized I need two hundred times that

[Hook: Big Sean]
I guess I gotta get my shit together
I guess, I guess I gotta get it
I guess it's do or die now huh
I guess I'm at the age that I can't try now huh
I guess, I guess, I guess so
I ain't gotta guess no more, I mean
I mean I'm at the age that I can't even try no more
I mean we gotta do it, it ain't even do or die no more

[Outro: Big Sean + Jhene Aiko]
I swear this life was made for us
All these late nights is made for us
Tell the old ones please pray for us
Tell 'em this Sunday to pray for us
I swear this life was made for us
No such thing as getting paid too much
Going all night, please pray for us
Going all night, please pray for us, oh God

[Hook]
Relax yourself girl, please settle down

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa & Phife Dawg]

[Wiz Khalifa]
Hunny say she love herself so mesmerized
Could tell that she smoke I see it in her eyes
Rollin up weed that’s my everyday
My ’69 drop ain't got no ashtray
I smile a lot, but baby girl I do not play
Aiyyo, my man Phife Diggy, he got something to say

[Phife Dawg]
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation
Told you in the jam that we can get down
Now let's knock the boots like the group H-Town
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little something on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat
Talking 'bout you

[Wiz Khalifa]
Yo, I smoked you out
I let hit with the bong, and blow the whole thing out
She like me cause my weed come 

[?] from another state
Pullin kush out by the pound girl it wasn't a 8th

[Hook]
Relax yourself girl, please settle down

[Wiz Khalifa]
Stretch out your legs, and get comfortable
Roll that mary jane, smell it through the wall
Careful how you smoke, it's very strong
Stronger than thai, stronger than cologne
Take you to the club and you buy me drinks
Now I wanna pound of kush that really stinks
Keep some marijuana and I'll be your boy

[Phife Dawg]
Original rude boy, never am I coy
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood
But hon, you got the goods, like Madelyne Woods
By the way, my name's Malik
The Five-Foot Freak
Let's say we get together by the end of the week
She simply said, "No", labelled me a ho
I said, "How you figure?" "My friends told me so"
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God, hon, I don't get down like that

[Wiz Khalifa]
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could roll and puff a L and I can F you to sleep
Do our own thing yea we keep it unique
When I get over to your crib then we officially meet

[Phife Dawg]
If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back, girl I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture

[Wiz Khalifa]
Chevy Woods, Jerm, and Ricky P
Loody, Motor, Lonny and my big man Breeze
They know Khalifa man is really soul on ice
The character is of men, not a computer lie
Shorty let me tell you about my only vice
It has to do with lots of chronic and it ain't nothin nice

[Hook]
Relax yourself girl, please settle down

[Outro]
Light one out for Phife Dawg

[Kirk Franklin]
Father
This prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feels they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times
Let them know that's why you took the nail
So we could have eternal life
If all God's children would get down on their knees and pray
And give up all of those things that pull our hearts away
You will forgive all of our wrong and make us brand new again
But I won't make it, God, if you let go of my hand
That's why we need more (Faith!)
Yes, I'm searching for you, I'm looking for (More!)
Yes I am, in Your arms is where I feel (Safe!)
They're killing our babies in the streets, I call out for (War!)
I need just a little bit more of some (Faith!)
Just a mustard seed, I'm looking for You for (More!)
Prayer for our homes and our families
We just wanna be (Safe!)
Can't you hear the trumpet sound, I think I hear (War!)

[Verse 1]
You're all alone
I did this
I got no one else to blame
You didn't know
I was a risk
And it's such a crying shame
How you gave me all of you and wanted nothing else from me
But to make some time for you but all I made you was lonely

[Chorus]
I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed

[Post Chorus]
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there

[Verse 2]
All of the times
You used to cry
Because I would let you down
I'm losing time
I should've tried
A little more to be around
But I didn't know that you were hurting, I was just too blind
Only thing I know for certain: another you I'll never find

[Chorus]
I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed

[Post Chorus]
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there

[Verse 3]
I'm filled with regret
I'm gonna tip and sew myself in misery
Now in your life
I'll take more time
No more yearning without me
But it hurts to think of you all by yourself but now I see
And I apologize for all the times I left you home waiting for me

[Chorus]
I couldn't see
But now I know
That I acted selfishly
I should've known
That I let you down
Caused you so much misery
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed
Forever to bleed

[Post Chorus]
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there
I should've been there

[Outro]
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there) 

[x3]
I'm gonna be there
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there) 

[x3]
I'm gonna be there

[Verse]
Maybe time
Takes life
But listen, it's all right
In our time, we'll find
Some winning to get try
It might
Be strange, but
Scenes, scenes
I'm begging you on my knees
Of love
Scenes, scenes
I wanna be in your dreams
That's all

[Verse 1]
I saw you in the carpet shades
Then I felt you like a baby's face

[Refrain 1]
Just float along and fill your lungs
Float along and breathe a deep breath

[Verse 2]
I saw you in the paper folds
And I saw you in my coffee mug

[Refrain 2]
Just float along and fill your lungs
Just float along and breathe a deep breath

[Refrain 3]
Just float along and fill your lungs
Just float along and fill your lungs
Just float along and breathe a deep breath
Just float along and fill your lungs

[Verse 1]
Gonna shake the world, shake the world off my back
I'm gonna hold my head high with the sun on my track

[Refrain 1]
Today, I've got no troubles in sight

[Verse 2]
Gonna put some pop in my step when I walk
I'm gonna show my mood off when I walk and I talk

[Refrain 2]
Today, I've got no troubles in sight
Gonna turn around, make everything that was wrong into right

[Verse 3]
Gonna look past things that I know I'll regret
'Cause life's a little too short for those worries, you can bet on me

[Refrain 3]
Today, I've got no troubles in sight
Gonna turn around, make everything that was wrong into...
Right, right

[Verse 4]
When I wake up late in the morning, you'll know
It takes a few more hours before I'll know

[Refrain 4]
Today, I've got no troubles in sight
Gonna turn around, make everything that was wrong into...
Right, right, right, right

[Verse 1]
I am my mother's son
And I'll keep doin' 'till the done gets done
I wouldn't steal for free
And I won't see you next to me

[Chorus]
'Cause I, oh, I
I, oh, I hope I don't wake up

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm a lonely soul
And I've got no friends on this road
And I'm a mystery Jack
The lines on my hands tell me I'm on track

[Chorus]
To die, oh, die
I, oh, I hope I don't wake up

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I, oh, I
I, oh, I hope I don't wake up
I hope I don't wake up
I hope I don't wake up
I hope I don't wake up

[Verse 1]
Let me mend the past
Let me see behind your mask
You finally go around
She stares at the ground
And acts if you're not there

[Verse 2]
Lock's on the door
Surveillance when you enter in the hall
Such a pointless cause
Her cups on my wall
It's hard to be ignored

[Chorus]
Let me mend the past
And make ends meet at last
Before they bleed
Don't wanna come across too weak

[Verse 1]
Let me mend the past
Let me see behind your mask
You finally go around
She stares at the ground
And acts if you're not there

[Chorus]
Let me mend the past
And make ends meet at last
Before they bleed
Don't wanna come across too weak

[Outro]
Let me mend the past
Let me mend the past
Let this be the last time I ask
Let me mend the past

[Verse 1]
At 30 past 7, you know I could be better
At 30 past 2, I'll get along with you
I'm grumpy in the morning
You know that when I'm yawning, it's true

[Chorus]
That I'll be snappy towards you
That I'll bite pieces out of you

[Verse 2]
30 past 7, 30 past 2
30 past 7, 30 past 2
30 past 2, 30 past 2
30 past 2, 30 past 2
I'm grumpy in the morning
You know that when I'm yawning, it's true

[Chorus]
That I'll be snappy towards you
That I'll bite pieces out of you
Bite pieces out of you, bite pieces out of you
Bite pieces out of you (bite pieces out of you)
Bite pieces, out of you

[Verse 1]
Well, meet me at the house on the top of the hill
I've got two important people that I'm ready to kill

[Refrain]
Well, I'll just flunk or fail so give me something better to do
Well, I'll just flunk or fail so give me something better to do

[Verse 2]
Well, Santa's on the roof with his presents and sack
He's got one hand with a blade and the other's an axe

[Refrain]
Well, I'll just flunk or fail so give me something better to do
Well, I'll just flunk or fail so give me something better to do

[Chorus]
Then I hear God call
And all my hate is gone
I hear Him calling me back home

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Oh, I heard God call
And now my hate is gone
I heard Him calling me back home
Calling me back home, calling me back home
Calling me back home, calling me, back home

[Bridge]
God!

[Chorus]
Well, God is calling me back home
Is calling me back home, is calling me back home
Is calling me, back home!
Well, God is calling me back home
Is calling me back home, is calling me back home
Is calling me back home, is calling me back home
Is calling me back home, is calling me back home
Is calling me back home
Is calling me back home (Is calling me back home)
Is calling me back home (Is calling me back home)
Is calling me back home (Is calling me back home)
Is calling me back home (Is calling me back home)
Is calling me back home (Is calling me back home)
Is calling me back home (Is calling me back home)
Is calling me back home, is calling me, back home...

[Outro]
What happened?

[Vinyl only intro]
This is DJ Richie 12-50
I'll be with you here in the Love-nasium til the stroke of midnight
Got a new one now, from King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard
It's called "I'm Not A Man Unless I Have A Woman"

[Chorus 1: Stu & Ambrose]
Well, I'm not a man unless I have a woman
Well, I'm not a man unless I have a woman
Oh, woman

[Verse 1: Stu & Ambrose]
She's a hundred pounds of gold (Yes I am)
She's a hundred pounds of gold
Well, I got mine, so I don't mind - no

[Chorus 2: Ambrose]
Oh, and I'm not a woman unless I have a man
Oh, and I'm not a woman unless I have a man, oh

[Verse 2: Stu]
I ain't gonna break your heart
'Cause I'm done breaking hearts, oh girl

[Chorus 3: Stu]
I'm not a man unless I have a woman
Well, I'm not a man unless I have a woman, oh

[Verse 1: Stu & Ambrose]
She's a hundred pounds of gold
He's a hundred pounds of gold
She's a hundred pounds of gold
He's a hundred pounds of gold
Well, I got mine, so I don't mind - no

[Verse 2: Stu & Ambrose]
I ain't gonna break your heart
Yeah, I know you won't
'Cause I'm done breaking hearts, oh, ho, yeah
Part I: Head On

[Verse 1]
Just yesterday, I sat across from my legs
They weren't connected to me
And I couldn't see 'cause my eyes weren't in me
Hold me up straight while I screw my head on
Head on

[Verse 2]
Just yesterday, I held the cup to my lips
Pouring it deep in my throat
Filling up me like a black enemy
Hold me up straight while I screw my head on
Head on
Head on
Head on

(Let it end!)
(Okay)
I wake up with the same pain every night
Digging a hatchet into my left side
Clearing my chest of something to burn
Ash for a decorative urn you keep in your mantelpiece;
Like a trophy for everything
That withers eventually

Call me a coward, but I'm too scared to leave
'Cause I want you to be the last thing I see
C'mon, call me a coward, because I'm too scared to leave
Watched you pouring lighter fluid out onto the leaves

And I would've loved you with the dying fire
Let you smother me down to the embers
Frostbite turning my limbs as black as cinder of funeral pyre

And I would have stayed if you'd asked me to
Stood outside till my lips turn blue
I wouldn't have blamed you
For leaving me there on the porch while you drank gasoline
'Cause it's what you needed so bad
And it's true
It's nothing that we could do

[Verse: Mike Shinoda]
And it goes like - bang!
And they're off and runnin'
Lookin' around like someone do somethin'
Scatter but it don't matter, I come gunnin'
So little time to squeeze all this fun in
Ah man!
Comin' at you now
Stupid enough to stand
We'll back you down
Like
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
What?
No it can't be stopped
Break out ya little riot, get it call the cops
Call the SWAT team, gimme all you got
The finger ready on the trigger
And we're callin' the shots, so
Y'all really gonna brawl or not
My best bet's you probably gonna stall or stop
Got gall, my crew rocks, up into ya block
And when I sit back
And put a hole in your chateau, ha
We don't huff and puff
We'll turn your homeland and stuff to a gust of dust
But I'm back, you act like enough's enough
Say a peep and I promise we'll fuck you up
Skip the rep for the sake of the family
I don't have to say a word, y'all understand me
Stand up I'll put you back down flat
And we'll keep it like, like, like that!

[Verse 1]
Love won't get you high as this
Drugs won't get you high as this
Fame won't get you high as this
Chains won't get you high as this
Juice won't get you high as this
Crew won't get you high as this

Life won't get you high like this here, no
He won't get you high like this here, no

"For Free?" won't get you high like this here, no
Two keys won't get you high, no, no, no

[Verse 3]
Shut your fuckin' mouth and get some cash, you bitch, you

Everything I'm working, gotta be the gas, you bitch, you

Shut your fuckin' mouth and get some cash, you bitch

Levitate, levitate, levitate, levitate

[Verse 1]
I remember stealing the peppermints out my momma's purse
She used to say, "there was a war on little black boys and it's only getting worse"
While everybody screaming and shouting, I got my best leave in church
Cause I don't wanna going on and know it all if the truth gon' hurt

[Chorus]
Then my grandma said, "boy, wake up
I think that he's talking to you"
She said, "wake up
God may have something for you to do"
Don't make me sad and make God mad
He's only gon' choose a few
You better wake up
Cause you're wearing your Sunday shoes

[Verse 2]
Then my grandma felt the spirit and she stood up slow
Then she just looked at me and smiled, and let my hand go
Then she already known she gotta go to God alone and she couldn't make me
And I only prayer when she was up there, as that a lifetime it wouldn't take me

[Chorus]
I don't wake up
I think somebody's talking to you
You better wake up
There may be something for you to do
Don't you make me sad and make God mad
He's only gon' choose a few
You better wake up
And tighten up your Sunday shoes

[Bridge]
Well, keep walking with Him
Cause God is the real love
Had for them owning so long
Don't be surprised how you could still fit up
Thank your momma, thank your daddy
Look at and you have it
My beloved grandma Ruby
Sunday morning and shining right through it

[Chorus]
Man, wake up
I think somebody's talking to you
You better wake up
There will be something for you to do
Don't you make me sad and make God mad
Cause he's only gon' choose a few
You better wake up
Cause you're wearing your Sunday shoes

[Outro]
Well, well, well

[Verse 1]
And I remember how the pillows felt like clouds
Or was it the other way around
And how your neighbor came in to yell at you
When the party got too loud

And when I snuck into your living room
And I wished that you would follow
At first you didn't but then you did
And it was already tomorrow

And you told me how you had an uncle
Who played the villain in those movies
And how he died and then you cried
You apologized profusely
I was nervous that this was as good as I could ever feel
And I was right

[Chorus]
I confess to thinking sex was my salvation
But really they just start with the letter 'S'
You'll forgive me for thinking heaven was her bedroom
It's as close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get

[Verse 2]
And I'll always remember picking up my favorite records from your apartment
Kissing you before you left me for New York
Weren't you a princess, or an heiress, or just the daughter of a rich man
In this land of constant sunshine I thought you'd never have to work

New York City's cold and when you love someone you should hold on to them so tightly
Till you crush them
Or they wriggle from your grasp
You don't just stand there and say nothing
But at least I learned my lesson

[Chorus]
I confess to thinking sex was my salvation
But really they just start with the letter 'S'
You'll forgive me for thinking heaven was her bedroom
It's as close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get

[Bridge]
If I ever make it to New York
Like I said that I would
Would it do me any good?

If I ever make it to New York
Like I told you on the phone
I confess to thinking sex was my salvation
When really they just start with the letter 'S'
You'll forgive me for thinking heaven was her bedroom
It's as close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get

I don't do too much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do

[Hook]

About how I have failed
To change all of my ways

[Hook]
These days

Yeah, I had a lover
Don't think I'd risk another
These days

And if I seem to be afraid
Just listen to the life I've made in songs

[Hook]
These days

[Verse 4]
I've stopped the dreaming
I don't do too much scheming

With windows down and count the stars

I used to drop bands at Philippe's

They even gave me a jacket
But I take it back to the streets
A tray cause I'm takin' a seat
Or I might take it straight to the Jeep
You flex if your Ex got a drive thru
Niggas don't hate when you eat
Fortune cookie told me my future
Said that I'm gonna be super
It said that I'm gonna be super
As long as I don't do nothin' stupid
Old shit is classic, it's cougar
Black Panther anthem, that cool look
Truly I'm Huey, no Aaron McGruder put air in your SCUBA
Might take you down to crustaceans
Might take you down to the depths
Or go to Dieppe
Ever rode through Paris on the chair of a scooter?
Feelin' myself I'm the master
I'mma get money like pastors
I wanna live in a castle
Where me and my panda gon' rastle
Dread so I look like a rasta
My competition imposters
Did it way down in Australia
Ferrari pull up to your Vauxhall
Mate, my enemy Holden
Boy my century golden
I was in China rockin' mastermind designer ate the food but this what I told 'em

[Interlude]
I mean it's aight
But we got, we got some shit back at the crib
That's the shit
You know what I'm sayin' niggas tryna flex

Rappers they treat me like Daigo
Press really think that I'm psycho
Genius should just be my bible
Gotta annotate for these dumb niggas (watch out, watch out)
I'm just foolin', boy, I'm just havin' fun with ya
Tetsuo was genius smart but when that Drogas drop on your computers
Fuck Genius boy, you gon' need a genius bar, god damn

Now is you up for the challenge
I told you already girl I am a savage
Sighing on the embers of a fire
That must be allowed to die
The bed of coal, it must run cold in time
But your body heat brings life

Crying in a river running dry
Made your eyes a clouded sky
But if you're a god
Made from a God
Made from a god
Let your whispered word be divine

If vultures can be soul birds, let it die
Leaning on the everlasting sigh

Creator, you create monstrous men
From the ink that clots your pen
Running on a sentence that must end
So your bones can rise again

If vultures can be soul birds, let it die
Leaning on the everlasting sigh

[Intro]
May you dream

[Verse 1]
You're chasing a daydream
Just not your own
I can't clip your grey wings
You've found a home

[Verse 2]
Sidle up the mountain
Through this bay fog
And I'll bridle paramount sin
Through the smog

[Verse 3]
Boat chained on the wharf now
Anchored angst
Oaths cannot be sworn now
It's too late

[Intro]
Man you already know who it is man

Silent steps every time I make a move

Booty bitches keep a nigga top notch
Gravy scraper run up on em while they hot
Fuck niggas
Fuck nigga, fuck nigga, suck my cock
It would be no surprise that Avicii’s retirement announcement would spark interesting developments across the electronic music sphere, and now we get our first concrete evidence of that.

Viagogo, calling itself the “world’s largest source of live event tickets,” has reported a 151% surge in demand for Avicii tickets. Demand for Creamfields alone surged 87% overnight.

Avicii’s final performances are in locations such as “Ibiza, Japan, Poland, Israel, Sweden and Dubai, as well as a stints at Lisbon’s Rock in Rio, Electric Daisy Carnival UK, Ultra Korea, Weekend Festival Baltic and Creamfields.”

A viagogo spokesperson commented: “Avicii has become a world-renowned DJ, carving himself as a major player in the industry, not just in the UK but across the globe. As a result he has a huge and loyal fanbase who are desperate to see him in what could be his ever last tour.”

It’s not uncommon for retirement announcements to send ticket prices and demand soaring; take the announcement of Kobe Bryant’s retirement into account, when tickets prices for his final game more than tripled after the announcement.

Undoubtedly, fans will be seeing this opportunity as their final chance to see a legend and to say goodbye. Though he will continue music, chances that he returns behind the decks are slim. However, we’ve seen similar claims from Wolfgang Gartner, Feed Me, and Pendulum, and look what happened there.

Truth is, only time will tell. In the meantime, fans will continue to clamor over tickets.

[Intro: Mark Sanchez + Action Bronson]
I'm looking for the, uh—the best rapper in Flushing Queens
Yeah, this is him
Uh, this must be Action?
This is Action
What' up, dude? It's Sanchez
What's going on, Sanchez Sanchize? What's up, my brother? How's everything?
Hahaha. This is Mark Sanchez and you're listening to Action Bronson

[Action Bronson]
Right out the weed spot
Bronsonelli fresh smoke a square bag
Pants sag over wally on the grandstand
Handstanding hookers at the Hilton
Aged meat sizzle to perfection paired it perfect with the fine Stilton
Rumpelstiltskin, butter on the leather
Fila on the footwear my mind is on the cheddar better
I keep my head up
Get it like a set up
Bitch, its Bronsonelli never see me in no get up homie
Only the ruggish shit people that im fucking with will rip your shortys nipple off her body for the fun of it
Order brunch sip a spritzer wit the summer mint
Roll a double dutch sour diesel smoke a ton of it
Duck from air to the plate
Roasted to perfection just like joey do to grams of the weight
We smoke heavy
Ain't a motherfucker on my levy
Keep the medal to the metal like a 97 Chevy
2010 got em buzzing like a beeper
Round table discussions conference in Geneva leaders
At the table polly over nasal
47 minutes since the time i lit the basil
My rhymes are carte blanche in the Oscars
Extra virgin olive oil drizzled on the pastas
Fry the bacon make it sizzle for the hostage
Honoring this thing of ours living like the mobsters
My compliments go to the chef and thats the real
Crew of goonies in the joint we need some extra veal
You know the caddy got a extra wheel
And if im ever in a pickle lock a hand ill fucking tech the steel
Take aim and knock an apple of your head
And imma play like polamalu you get tackled for the bread
Running in your crib your shortys shackled to the bed
Money laying on the persian leaking plasma from the lead

[Intro]
Pack up
I'm straight
Enough

[Bridge]
Oh say say say

Wait...They don't love you like I love you
Wait...They don't love you like I love you

Don't stray
Oh say say say

[Chorus]
Wait...they don't love you like I love you
Wait...they don't love you like I love you

Wait...they don't love you like I love you
Wait...they don't love you like I love you
Maps
Wait...they don't love you like I love you
It's not in the way that you hold me
It's not in the way you say you care
It's not in the way you've been treating my friends
It's not in the way that you stay'd till the end
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time

It's not in the words that you told me
It's not in the way you say you're mine
It's not in the way that you came back to me
It's not in the way that your love set me free
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
{​Instrumental}​

It's not in the words that you told me
It's not in the way you say you're mine
It's not in the way that you came back to me
It's not in the way that your love set me free
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time

I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back

And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette
And the message coming from my eyes
Says leave it alone

Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell

And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do
And the feeling coming from my bones
Says find a home
I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will sing no more
And the stains coming from my blood
Tell me go back home

[Karim Fonda]
She ain't a nasty girl she a dumb ass kid
She shit a brick when she seen me jizz
Blew it back like a gust of wind, tapped her jaw shit bust her chin
She gave me head and a piece of her mind
And she hating on the one Dontiva Divine uh
She knows its a waste of time but the memories bitter, taste the lime
She jerk me off with the fluid stroke and she use dish soap for the extra glide
That was back when my money could press rewind
Back when the stable had fresh behind
Genitals were at the barbarian prime
Tearing up butt i was on my grind
Now I’m looking for a brand new groupie
A nasty girl with a butt that could bouff me

[J-Love]
Thats right baby,yeah you little bitch,you make that mouth,TRAMP

[J-Love]
Wild barbarian open bitch like caesarean hold too much meat never vegetarian
Chicks miss the J-love the packing district
Beside him went mystic fuck so explicit
Orgasm wizard 6 flags roaring rapids
Ignoring Hiv just ask Magic
Always riding thoroughbred apple dub jockey
Dick slapstick Wayne Gretzky hockey
You know its big papi i slide in Dominicans
Keep ass on reservation Foxwood Indians
Glorious sperm discharge in esophagus
So preposterous tits so monstrous
Phenomenal rub down twat water drown
Vagina monologues cum on your night gown
Alize négligée sour diesel hennesy
Volcano eruptions cum sucking entrees

[Intro: Pimp C, Drake & Amber Rose]
Check, one-two, one-two, bitch
You expensive, you know that?
I'm high maintenance a little bit but not in a
Not in a negative way
I just like extremely expensive things

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Foot off in their ass is what Ken told me
Niggas like to play games
'Cause they feel like they know me (they know me)
You don't know me, nigga, I done changed (I done changed)
So don't be trying to be putting on shit off in the game (Game)
This ain't no motherfucking 91

(In this shit but Bun)

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
You would think it's all mine the way I took it (Yeah)
You would think it broke down the way I push it (Yeah)
You hate it when I coat things all in sugar
You want to hear the real talk, well, girl, who wouldn't? (Yeah)

[Chorus: Drake]
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?
You don't have no time to lay up
You just tryna be somebody
'Fore you say you need somebody
Get all your affairs in order
I won't have affairs, I'm yours, girl
Faithful, faithful, faithful, faithful

[Verse 2: Drake]
You hit me like "I know you’re there with someone else" (Yeah)
That pussy knows me better than I know myself
On my way from the studio, so get undressed
Let's do the things that we say on text (Yeah)
I want to get straight to the climax (Straight, straight to the)
Yeah, have you coming all summer like a season pass (Yeah)
I want to turn you out like pitch black
Want to watch you do work while I sit back (Yeah)
'Cause you talk like you got what I need (Yeah)
You talk like you got the juice and the squeeze (Yeah)
Talk like you bet it all on me (Yeah)
And you can't take no Ls off me

You want me to show ya (I'm gonna show you again)
Now we're in the zone, yeah (Gon' let me all in again, ooh)

Over and over again, over and over again
Now you're coming over
Over and over again, over and over again
You tell me I should know ya (But I'll get to know you again)
And you want me to show ya, uh (I'm gonna show you again)
When were in the zone you (Gon' let me own it again)
And now you're coming over
(Over and over and over and over and over again)
Now you're coming over, you're coming over

“DABBLE IN TRUFFLES”

Spark a seance, Niggas moving packs like crayon
Delicate ray on tap while he gently put the spray on
Turn to Tommy was the ID when i caught the robbery
No more playing lobbies smuggle drugs in bitches bodies
Elegance on the mic corruption chaos man of Steel
The triple goose that we know, foie gras with every meal
A glass of red glass of white glass of pink
6 niggas one bitch and everybody smash and stink
Grab her neck, punch her back, nut one in her shoe
We all went sushi style hoping we don’t catch that flu
Storm the point and overturn thats how this bastard do
Believe in science fuck God ill kill the pastor too
While eating pasta dude, low level prostitute, for money big guns this motherfucker gots to shoot
Marinated for a week, roasted lamb legs
Its Queens nigga the herb smoke is a mandate
Red roses, brown leathers, and black guns
The green money and beige crack attract bums
Fiends fighting for that last wibble  left on the floor
Keeps me dipping in my sock in the back of the store
Flying niggas from overseas to do the hit
Back on the plane the same day movie shit
Got the word they tried to hit me over petty matters
Next scene catch me swinging from the helli ladder
Empty your magazines, shotguns, and rocket launchers, hand grenades, handguns, and fire torches
Off the boat Albanians the one to trust
He had a face, he had hands, It wasn’t us
Take a twisted ride with me through the eyes of a goon
Pussy bring your man with you sending 2 to the tomb

[Verse 1: Drake]
Girl, I hate the fast talking, fast walking, fast fucking, fast loving oh
Wanna move slow
Got a little liquor in my system, always been friends underestimating how far that that shit go
Leave a little room for me
Leave a little room for your imagination
You should just take time with me
Nowadays there's time but not anticipation

[Pre-Hook: Drake + PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Oh oh oh
What is?
What is? What is? What is different about me? Oh
Tell me. What is? What is?
Can't keep you off of me

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Nowadays you can't get enough of me
Loving me, loving me, loving me more
You loving me, love when you loving me
Oh yeah, yeah

[Pre-Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
What is?
What is? What is? What is different about me? Oh
Tell me. What is? What is?
Can't keep you off of me

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Nowadays you can't get enought of me
Loving me, loving me, loving me more
You loving me, love when you loving me...
Oh yeah yeah

[Action Bronson]
I roll the blunt up as soon as i wake my thoughts a linen
My flow is like a one night stand with all sorts of women
The orchestrator, the picture perfect portrait player
Lose your data tryna stop me on the course to paper
Mustard loafer hopping out the gypsy cab
One dutch but I copped 150 bag
Thats for my neck just like a scarf in the winter
Plus i spit the type of shit to make you barf up your dinner
Bronson a winner, gorgonzola garlic agenda
Far from pretender shorty take the coat when i enter
The public defender, the man of the people nobody equal
My fam negotiating your life most of em hebrew
Black kosher posing with the black toaster
Me and Hugginatti dipping in the black cobra
American built ground up from ground up
Get ground up, duck never get found fuck
Sharp with the dressing Bronsonelli reek of street essence
Mean Jean holding down the scene and plus we green scented
Reinvented summertime we flee the benches
37 sour diesel blunts to feed the senses
Back to rocking old lives a pair of high 4’s
I eat the dinner of a winner often five course
I rhyme words baby mama say my mind lost
Cause all my garments stay embroided with a fine horse
One for the weed, two for the whip drive in the middle
Three we on the roof she play my penis like a fiddle
Four the tuna raw until i seer it
Five my name is golden though so people try to smear it
Hop up out the six, I’m in the mix, I rock the colorful kicks
I smoke the pure but still I’m quick to cop a bundle of nicks
Eating pussy cause i had to feed the hunger for fish
Time is money when i have it never fumble and shit
Until my suit from France, the bottom of the shoe just like a ball court
Leather so soft, four door porsche
Not the truck panamera and its roughed out
Sitting like a monster on the decker looking puffed out
I take juice my performance enhanced
Never failing any test i got the urine from gramps
94 i begged my mom to cop the Ewing from Champs
The same night dreamt of a bitch and her spewing my pants damn
One motherfucker galaxy of Queens rep
Clients waiting while the custard made a cream set
30 sets of dips fuck all that extra shit
Dimples above her ass cheeks that made me sex that bitch

[Hook]
And you know one thing that's great about that problem
That it's not my problem
That's on you bitch
That's on you
That's on you bitch
That's on you
You know one thing that's great about that problem
The fact that that's not my problem
That's on you bitch
That's on you
That's on you bitch
That's on you
You know one thing that's great about that problem
Is that the fact that it's not my problem
That's on you bitch
That's on you
That's on you bitch
Who knew

Thumper larger than uma nigga

[?]

[?] pool-less
Oh I need 40 acres and a girl that got a mule ass
I fucked three white girls this evening
Toughen up when I'm overdone
Fucked three white girls this evening
Martin Luther King be proud of it cause I overcome

[KANYE YELL 1]
Got that one out
Got that one off

[KANYE YELL 2]
Bumping off to tell a nigga something

[Hook]
Want to know one thing about that problem

[Verse 2]
Now 4 dose I'm overdosing

Bumping a nigga then I need to know
Gotta di-di-di-di-do eat it though

[?] needs dough
Niggas be all on when they need ya
Numma numma all on when they need ya
Then they forget to repay you
I call that shit nigga-nesia
This right here this is a speed bump
We goin up when the knee jump
I'mma go pump for a knee jerk
Motherfuckers working like they need work

[Hook]
The only good thing about that problem
It really ain't my problem
That's on you bitch
That's on you
That's on you bitch
That's on you

[Outro]
Where y'all niggas at?
Where y'all niggas at?
Where y'all niggas at?
What's up nigga
Where y'all niggas at?
Where y'all niggas at?

[Lyrics from Snippet]


I been overthinkin', I should dip up outta here
I don't even know nobody, why am I still here?
Feelin'-


Do whatever make you feel good
Hesitate make it feel good for the meantime
Drag it out for the longest
Waiting on you for the longest

I don't know what's the hold-up
Nigga you could never show up...

...

Do whatever just to feel good
Left over make it feel good
Calling you when I said I wouldn't
Loving you when I know I shouldn't
Trusting you when I said I wouldn't
Guess what
It's a new day, same face, better brain, better body, new case...

Ain't no love love for you rap niggas, you rap niggas, you rap niggas
Yeah, fuck you rap niggas
Ain't no love for you fake niggas, you snake niggas
You snitch niggas, yeah fuck you bitch niggas

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm the type of nigga I don't give a fuck nigga, I bump into a nigga
Don't even say sorry
I'm the type of nigga get dead azz fresh
Then go to my enemy birthday party
Pop the truck got a sawnoff pump
Have your running like Forrest Gump
Gucci mane pockets gone keep the mumps
In east Atlanta call me Donald trump
Ion rap with u can't rap with you
Never sold a brick in the trap with you
The real la flare and I'm a millionaire but I get your ass killed for a stock or 2
I don't see niggas, I just see commas
None of these niggas don't keep it 100
Came up bumping so old so bumping
Never met another nigga so dishonest
CEO shit shoot dice for artist
Bump into each other who life the hardest
Talking trap shit cause my ice the largest
Everybody think they kids the smartest
An independent nigga with a major artist
A Gucci Mane show is a gangster
Glock 40 on my waist
Got a 40 in my pocket and a young nigga with me with a extra 40

[Hook: OG Boo Dirty] x 2
Ain't no love love for you rap niggas, you rap niggas, you rap niggas
Yeah, fuck you rap niggas
Ain't no love for you fake niggas, you snake niggas

[Verse 2: OG Boo Dirty]

Fuck a rap nigga I don't fuck with rap niggas
I kill a rap nigga jump the ...on my GE
Never saw me, never heard of me
What's taking so long just to google my g
Money on niggas they trigger crazy
Glock 19 with the stitch on handle
You a pussy ass rapper, just a Hollywood actor
But if I catch in my seat send them young niggas at you
Let's bag it up, and whatever I say, I can bag it up
Mind for a living nigga chain for wood
Bang on whoever, I don't give a fuck
Go anywhere with my ice on, rep the snake like a python
Same old g nut chain hoe, bad boy, bust a cone
Fuck these rappers, I expose these niggas
All these goons can hold these niggas
Real white and blue you the police nigga
Shawty get the fire, put a hole in the nigga
You been missing the action, hey, what you dead nigga
Come home pussy, I know you scared nigga

[Hook] x 2
Ain't no love love for you rap niggas, you rap niggas, you rap niggas
Yeah, fuck you rap niggas
Ain't no love for you fake niggas, you snake niggas
You snitch niggas, yeah fuck you bitch niggas

[Verse 3: Rocko]

Busting moves with lil yoga, I hit licks with tp
Probably sold out 50 hunned thousand nicks, mvp
Graduated to the weight, no fucking waited on my wake
I ran that sack up to the sky, no fucking waited on my wait
I'm addicted to the cake, I whip that milk I make it shake
I jump that pack till it's all gone, then I recook up all that shake
Till I met my nigga shake, rip my nigga shake
Told me rock you the hardest, I can tell you not no artist
Running bread in 8, still got bread in la, second time that I broke bread with la
On the 4th im in the...Gucci gutter as it get
Blue dirty my fucking ace, whatever he with, that's what I'm with

[Hook] x 2
Ain't no love love for you rap niggas, you rap niggas, you rap niggas
Yeah, fuck you rap niggas
Ain't no love for you fake niggas, you snake niggas

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Two emcees, that's all we need
This a freestyle off of the top, proceed
I come from the West
You know I gotta get 'em
Flow sicker than cancer in Manchester
Yes-ugh
As we rock from off the top
You know I got the sure shot
I make it hot
I go from Compton to Watts to the suburb-ian-ghettos
If you want to see me everybody say hello!

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Yo!, give me that motherfucking mic back
Tryna battle
I'll put your little ass in the saddle
How you don't see before
You can't see me
Never better emcee that's fucking shorter than me

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Yo, yo
I'm-ma use that mic
I'm-ma do that right
I'm-ma spit this all day and all night
Anybody wanna come under pressure?
Anybody wanna see God(?)-bless ya
I love ya 'fro, you got the head of the future
Rocky, good kid, mad city (good kid, M.A.A.D. City)
I was there-ah
Now I had to switch it up and get the braids
Now I had to come through
Flow sicker than AIDS
I gotta get paid, I gotta get laid
I gotta come true, gotta be real
I gotta be proof, gotta be you
Gotta be us and gotta be due

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Step up, emcee
If you want time right now
Come right now
And shine! (x6)

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
Hold up!
I gotta leave y'all with at least a few bars
It's not about the women, the money, stars, and cars
It's not about the clothes, the hoes
Know who we are
It's all about the mentality
Love making chords
Your life makes you bruised and battered
But that don't matter
If you wanna know
Fuck all that chitter-chatter
Do your thing, let 'em sing
Let the gun-boy reign
Bite the sound, I just came and blazed
What's up!

[Chorus]
Amid the gate, he stares at my door
How long did I see him stay?
Days or months, I couldn’t say
Yet it bustles me, and what for?

I swear I saw him moan
But my window’s thick and cloudy
And I won’t disdain a sentry’s duty!
Fleeing my home for venture lone!?

[Chorus]
Amid the gate, he stares at my door
How long did I see him stay?
Days or months, I couldn’t say
Yet it bustles me, and what for?

That drone haunts me from abroad
A middle tone, a new norm
A safe zone, applauding form
My yard is steep and deep, thank God!
You moan
I saw you moan
You moan
I saw you moan
Me, she a talk
Me, she a talk to
Me, she a talk to me
A talk to she
We must meet, she a talk
Me, she a talk to

We must meet, she a talk

We must meet meet meet meet meet meet meet meet meet meet meet meet meet meet meet

But the day is coming that we must meet personally

But the day is coming that we must meet personally
She a talk to me, and me a talk to she
But the day is coming that we must meet personally

She a talk to me, and me a talk to she
But the day is coming that we must meet personally

She a talk to me, and me a talk to she
But the day is coming that we must meet personally

But the day is coming that we must meet personally

She a talk to me, and me a talk to she

[Verse 1]
Honey, please
(You're not used to what you're feeling)
I never thought I'd have to see your face again
But my love just realized (You're feeling)
When she stared into my eyes (You're feeling)
She might be too good for me
(You're not used to what you're feeling)
I'm almost dead to her
I'm sleeping with a frozen heart (You're feeling)
Well, baby girl, it's over now (You're feeling)
And I can always count on you, oh
(You're not used to what you're feeling)
My unshackled girl, unrestrained to touch (You're feeling)
You're immune to love (You're feeling)
It's so priceless to me
(You're not used to what you're feeling)
That you're always free
That you'll take me in (You're feeling)
You're my favorite sin (You're feeling), favorite sin, ooh-woah

[Chorus]
(You're not used to what you're feeling)
Oooooooh (You're feeling)
Oooooooh (You're feeling)
As you are
(You're not used to what you're feeling)
As you are
Oooooooh (You're feeling)
Oooooooh (You're feeling)

[Verse 2]
I see you as you are
(You're not used to what you're feeling)
When I'm staring at my dreams
You know I only like it when you're mine (You're feeling)
When I'm faded in my dreams (You're feeling)
It seems that I've had to let you go
(You're not used to what you're feeling)
'Cause now you're lying on the floor

[?] (You're feeling)

[?] (You're feeling)

[Chorus]
You're not used to what you're feeling
You're feeling
You're feeling
You're not used to what you're feeling
You're feeling
You're feeling
You're not used to what you're feeling
You're feeling
You're feeling
You're not used to what you're feeling
You're feeling
You're feeling
You're not used to what you're feeling
You're feeling
You're feeling
You're not used to what you're feeling
You're feeling
You're feeling
You're not used to what you're feeling
You're feeling

You're not used to what you're feeling

[Intro]
Some of those you can take off though
I don't like all of that shit yeah, yeah
I'm just tryna find my way (that's hard)
I'm just tryna find my way (that's fire)

[Verse]
Bout to light up for (?) and gaze
We transcendin' into different days
They say he say she say, life is sweeter than lemonade
Reach for the light cause undoubtedly we seen dimmer days
Hundred percent the world full of minute maids
I lost and found inside the disarray and aye
Can you see it? Can you feel it?
Lost innocence the smell of teen spirit
Sometimes I can't breath even the lyrics
And sometimes, just sometimes I seem fearless
Naw I'm just livin' like you
I'm in my feelin's like you
Feelin' like a victim like you
Sometimes I pop a pain killer, maybe like two
And I, uh, yeah
Rest in peace to my aunt, it's her funeral today
But I'm too busy tryna finish up this album
And I don't know if my feelin's turned numb or anything
But ain't no tears comin' out 'em
Like how come?
I guess life'll triple all the baggage you can handle
We ain't landin' this yet
Stayin' focused with the cannabis lit
I handle my shit
Runnin' so high recently I'm makin' the devil resent
Hope my friends ain't on no scandal and shit
I hope my lady ain't plot to put her hand on my chips
I'm standin' to get my dreams granted hand over fist like
How can I resist?
And if I ain't chasin' on dreams then how can I exist?
How can I exist?
And if I ain't chasin' on dreams then how can I exist?
Nigga just listen, aye

[Outro]
I'm just tryna find my way
I'm just tryna find my way
I'm just tryna find my way
I'm just tryna find my way
I'm just tryna find my way
I'm just tryna find my way
I'm just tryna find my way
I'm just tryna find my way

[Verse]
Fight back, shoot back, loot that, protest
Brick to the helmet, I ain't feeling no stress
Going up against the cops, I ain't wearin' no vest
The city where I come from makes your life 

[?]
We try to stay focused, go to school, listen
But for our school, it's just another pre-prison
The only way the people listen is when they threatened
So grab your weapon, it'll be on in a second
Class warfare, yeah, we got it all here
The poor gettin' so poor they cannot even bear
The rich gettin' so rich they cannot even share
Won't give an equal share to those that got 'em there
Label rights, pay what's right
You got the microphone today, my brother
You gotta say what's right
You know the cops work for the first class, not the rear class
So they get the protection and we get the tear gas

[Part 1: Summer Sixteen]

Diamonds dancin' like Mike Jackson (Mike!)
Shit shining like Mike's jacket (Lit!)
Moonwalkin' in a Rolls Royce
Through the rearview, see my life backwards (Skrt!)

So wavy, nigga I ain't rappin'
Can't tell me that I ain't swaggin', no way, ha!

[Part 2: Panda]

[Intro]
This summer right here, nigga

[Verse]
I'm with Ruggs in Atlanta
Bunch of drugs and the Fanta
Bunch of guns in the Phantom
Spendin' money like a scammer
My young niggas in the kitchen whippin'
Whippin', livin' large at the hammer
Duckin' laws and the scammers
Free my dawgs out the slammer
Black car, panther
Shorty call, never answer
20 foreigns in the mansion
Diamonds on me and they dancin'
I don't really understand rappers
Niggas jumpin' on bandwagons
All these bands got my pants saggin'
63s on the Benz wagon
62s on the Maybach
Bitch, I'm comin' for the payback
62s in the pot, nigga

Shots never stoppin', pop, pop, pop, pop
We'll run up on you (Hoo!)
Dead bodies, homicide, head shot, mama cry
Cops lookin', got an alibi
Lawyer money, nigga, buyin' time
Hold! They hit my nigga Chino in his head
Hold! Took him to LIV though my nigga ain't dead
No! Ball in Miami on Sunday, we did
Ho! Blowin' the racks, we at Vanity Grand
All black Panamera
White bitch named Samantha
White and black, she a panda
White and black, she a bandit
Whippin' the... rock with the...
Hhnnhh, hnnhhnhh

[Intro]
I want you to know
Everywhere I go, Im thinking bout you
Thinking bout you
And everywhere I go, I'm thinking bout you
Thinking bout you

[Verse 1]
Late night when you in your room
And you turn your TV down and turn up yo tunes
Do you look at those pictures of us in your room?
Do ya? Do ya?
I bet so cause when I'm at home alone
And you come across my dome, I hear voices of your moan
And when I look at my dresser every time I see your thong
And it make me think about when I get you alone

[Hook]
Ohh ohh, Baby here we go
Every time we doing great this nigga always mess up the picture
Tell me what’s the issue
I need me some Swishers, to take my mind away
I need to escape
Ohh ohh, baby here we go
Every time we doing great this nigga always mess up the picture
Tell me what’s the issue
I need me some Swishers, to take my mind away
I need to escape

[Verse 2]
And I’m getting tired
Tired of trying
Trying to drag us, but that shit goes nowhere
I miss when you loved me
But I know that means nothing
When I move on I hope that you feel the punishment
The punishment of being stuck with that lame nigga
Who can’t do shit for ya
You know that I’ll be there for ya
But you gotta let me know what’s up

[Hook]
Ohh ohh, Baby here we go
Every time we doing great this nigga always has to mess up the picture
Tell me what’s the issue
I need me some Swishers, to take my mind away
I need to escape
And I’m getting tired
Tired of trying
Trying to drag us, but that shit just goes nowhere
I miss when you loved me
But I know that means nothing
When I move on I hope that you feel the punishment
The punishment of being stuck with that lame nigga
Who can’t do shit for ya

[Outro]

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
Dropped outta school, now we dumb rich (Dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (One shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (Pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (A lifestyle)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it (Do not make it)
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum
(They do, they do)
And I like to finish what you think you started
Man, you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
You've still got my number, girl, you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me 'cause they never got me

[Bridge: JAY-Z]
They still out to get me, they don't get it
I cannot be got, and that's a given

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They like, "Pablo—"
"Why are all the windows tinted on your Tahoe?"
"Why do you know every single bitch that I know?"
"Why can't you just shut your mouth and take the high road?"
Fuck if I know, that's that Chicago
South, south side, that's the motto
Cop a crib and spend ten million on remodel
Take the devils out my life and preach the gospel, 'cause I know
We went way, way past the line of scrimmage, ayy
Throne is back up in it, ayy
In the field like Emmitt, ayy, y'all get so offended, ayy
I be blacking out, I ain't backing out
Jay about his business, and I'ma let you finish, but I
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna rock your body
Take you to the garage and do some karate
Chop it, chop it, chop it, chop it sipping sake
Throw a thick bitch on a Kawasaki (Perfect)

[Chorus: Drake]
Dropped outta school, now we dumb rich (Dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (One shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (Pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (Lifestyle)

[Refrain: Kyla]
Baby, I like your style

[Verse 1: Drake]
Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

[Chorus: Drake]
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

[Refrain: Kyla]
Baby, I like your style

[Verse 2: Drake]
Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time, and that's why

[Chorus: Drake]
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

[Post-Chorus: Wizkid]
Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Wine it, wine it, she love me long time
Oh, yeah, very long time
Back up, back up, back up, and wine am
Back up, back up, and wine am, girl, just
Back up, back up, back up, and wine am
Oh, yeah, very long time
Back, up, back up and wine am, girl

[Bridge: Kyla]
Oh, tell me, I need to know
Where do you wanna go?
'Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control

[Breakdown: Kyla & Wizkid]
Where, where, where
Where, where, where, where (Oh, yeah, very long time)
Where, where, where (Back up, back up, and wine am, girl)
Where, where, where, where
'Cause if you're down (Back up, back up, and–)
'Cause if you're down (Back up, back up, and–)
'Cause if you're down (Back up, back up, and–)

[Chorus: Drake & Kyla]
I need a one dance (Where, where, where)
Got a Hennessy in my hand (Where, where, where, where)
One more time 'fore I go (Where)
Higher powers taking a hold on me (Where, where, where, where)
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

[Outro]
How do you spell "Hennessy?"
I put two "N"s and two "S"es, is it like that? Hen... Henn... Henn...
It's definitely not showing up
I know "Hennessy" has two "S"es for sure, so I'm gonna take out one of the "N"s

This performance features a clear example of using symbolism to enrich the message of the song

Blood on the Leaves tells the story of a relationship torn apart by materialism, unprotected sex, and drugs. West samples Nina Simone's rendition of 'Strange Fruit', a song that paints a vivid picture of racial violence in the segregated South. West samples the line: "Black bodies swinging from the summer breeze; strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees." The frenzied, pitched up use of this line cast the song in a racial light. The characters in 'Blood on the Leaves' become the lynched victims in 'Strange Fruit'. Instead of racial violence, these characters have fallen victim to the perils of materialism, drugs and unprotected sex, all of which are issues that disproportionately affect the black community

West performed this song,already saturated with meaning, at the VMA awards in front of a purposefully lighted and positioned backdrop of a photo by film director Steven McQueen. The photo depicts a tree in New Orleans that was the site of racially charged lynchings. It’s lit and positioned in such a way that as West performs in front of it, he appears as a shadow, his erratic movements almost resembling a man hanging from the branches. The shadows of the audience’s raised hands appear at the bottom of the frame, as if coming out of the ground, representing the scores of victims buried at sites like this across America

Http://divaartist.com/divablog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screenshot_2013-08-26-00-20-13_1.jpg

After the performance West posted a picture of the tree captioned: "those who were murdered are buried in the ground around the tree."

This nuanced imagery, rife with symbolism, paints a powerful and disturbing scene that adds potency to West’s message of the relics of slavery in today's society

[Verse]
All my life I've been learning
I've always lived for today
And I don't know about tomorrow
But I can choose who I become

[Pre-Chorus]
Got wasted too many days
I got led on the wrong way, oh
You left on a Wednesday
It might have even been your birthday, oh
You told me to "go fuck yourself"
Guess I rubbed you the wrong way, oh
I wasted too many days

[Chorus]
And we
We burn faster than light
Shine across in the night sky
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Got wasted too many days
I got led on the wrong way, oh
You left on a Wednesday
It might have even been your birthday, oh
You told me to "go fuck yourself"
Guess I rubbed you the wrong way, oh
I wasted too many days

[Chorus]
And we
We burn faster than light
Shine across in the night sky
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light
We burn faster than light

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
You said that we would always be
Without you I feel lost at sea
Through the darkness you'd hide with me
Like the wind we'd be wild and free

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

[Chorus]
I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

[Verse 2]
Now I'm running away, my dear
From myself and the truth I fear
My heart is beating I can't see clear
How I'm wishing that you were here

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

[Chorus]
I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

[Verse 1]
Melancholy mood forever haunts me
Steals upon me in the night, forever taunts me
Oh, what a lonely soul am I, stranded high and dry
By a melancholy mood

[Verse 2]
Gone is every joy and inspiration
Tears are all I have to show, no consolation
All I see is grief and gloom, 'til the crack of doom
Oh, melancholy mood

[Bridge]
Deep in the night I search for a trace
Of a lingering kiss, a warm embrace
But love is a whimsy, as flimsy as lace
And my arms embrace an empty space

[Verse 3]
Melancholy mood, why must you blind me
Pity me and break the chains, the chains that bind me
Won't you release me, set me free, bring her back to me
Oh, melancholy mood
John:

Driving to Hawaii
Surfing down the street
Dreaming of these places
I may never see

Maybe if we get there
Things will be much easier
And life won't be nothing anymore
Well babe then we’re together
We’ve always such nice weather
Guess we don’t need these places anyway

We’ll strum out and be picking our guitars
We’ll drink all day and sing under the stars
How magically simple our life could be

Driving to Tahiti
Lets take off your bikini
Jump in something warmer
And fall asleep together
Maybe when it’s all done
We can grow our hair long
Life won't be nothing anymore
Well babe when we’re together
We’ve always such nice weather
Guess we don’t need these places anyway

Driving to Hawaii
Surfing down the street
Driving to Hawaii
Surfing down the street
Driving to Hawaii
Surfing down the street
Driving to Hawaii
Surfing down the street

Yeah, I been messin' around

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
The way you lick your lips, yeah, I like that
When you act like a bad girl, I like that
That little sexy look you got, mmm, I like that
The way you whisper in my ear how you want it when you want it, girl, I like that
Let's go, baby, let's ride
Let's not talk about it, let's do it
How you want it, English or Spanish?
Both of them, I'm fluent
We can get freaky in the morning or in the afternoon
We can go all night long, baby, it's all up to you

[Pre-Chorus: Enrique Iglesias & Pitbull]
You can get sexy if you want to
And you can bring your girls if you want to
And we can hit the crib if you want to
And we can mess around if you want to
Tell me, you want to?

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias & (Pitbull)]
I heard from a friend who heard it from a friend
Who heard it from another
You been messin' around
I'm hoping that your friend, too, told you about me, too
Cause I'ma tell you straight up, I been messin' around
I been messin' around (I been, I been)
I been messin' around (I been, I been)
I been messin' around (I been, I been)
Yeah, I been messin' around

[Post-Chorus: Both, Pitbull]
Enrique, let's break it down right quick
I'm ready, girl, are you ready?
I'm ready, girl, are you ready?
I'm ready, girl, are you ready?
I'm ready, girl, are you ready?

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
The way you talk dirty, yeah, I like that
The way you bring other girls, yeah, I like that
The way you rock them heels, yeah, I like that
No thong up under that skirt, ooh, I like that
And you can get crazy, yeah, that's cool
You can get loose, yeah, that's cool
You got some Voli, yeah, that's cool
Let's jump on the bar, yeah, that's cool
Let's push the gas, I'm like ooh
I don't mean to be rude, but I swear to God
There's so many things that I'd love to do to you

[Pre-Chorus: Enrique Iglesias & Pitbull]
You can get it sexy if you want to
And you can bring your girls if you want
And we can hit the crib if you want to
And we can mess around if you want to
Tell me, you want to?

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias & (Pitbull)]
I heard from a friend who heard it from a friend

Need to breathe, need to breathe, this bubble needs some air
Ah-ah-air, need to get some air

[Verse 2]
Fresh and clean like January
Here's that credit itintery
Playing that game, get your referee
Victory is necessary
Hide your ones like bitchionary
But, you know me, I keep it clean
I don't like doing things I don't really mean
That's my team, sport or win
We don't give a fuck 'bout reppin' green
Kicking down the doors, get your scene
I'm going to be your chick supreme

[Verse 3]
Make you scream for the dream
Do it clean, spin your wheels
I stitched your seams, sew what you mean
So what if I want a world to gleam?
Part of the team, you're part of the theme
If you want change, then you gotta go in

[Chorus]
'Cause this generation, wr-wr-wr-we rewear it
'Cause this generation, wr-wr-wr-we rewear it
'Cause this generation, wr-wr-wr-we rewear it
'Cause this generation, wr-wr-wr-we rewear it
We rewear it, we rewear it

Reset the rhythm, we don't walk away

Ha ha! Yo (Woo), that last one was amazing, them boys was hot

Let me just formally thank y'all before we bring out the last guests of the evening (Thank you)
We just wanna say thank you, (Thank you, thank you)
For coming out to the 16th annual "His Or Hers Potluck"!

God damn! (16 years, motherfucker)
And Jessica, let me tell you something about them yams, baby girl
You leave that Tupperware around here (Yams)
I'm gonna have to put my dick in it and impregnate your yams (God)
'Cause I'm going to fuck them yams up, baby girl. (Woo, hoo hoo!)
Sweet ass yams, (God damn!)
Jesus Christ, God damn
Let me... okay
Well, the last headlining group of the night, they go by the name of "BROCK..." (BROCKHAMPTON) "BROCKHAMPTON," yes
These boys is coming straight out of southeast Texas (South Texas, y'all)
Hotter than chicken grease (Woo!)
These motherfuckers, I'm going to say the name 1, 2, 3 times, (Yeah, let the...)
BROCKHAMPTON, BROCKHAMPTON, BROCKHAMPTON (Let the names off they 'cause, listen because...)
The thing is about BROCKHAMPTON, is that it's a group

Also, wait, there's one more on the card!
Okay, we got, we got this boy... uh... ah... bearface (bearface, yeah)
Bearface, yes, that's his name

He sounded like he was from Scotland
One of them niggas from the last Highlander movie
S... where the fuck is Scotland?
I don't know man
What the fuck is a Scotland? (It's somewhere near Greenland)
Or Iceland
He... yeah, he, he not from here y'all, he, he from the, ah... the eh, the, not the America (Mm hmm)
The other parts

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
Dressed in the same shit I wore yesterday
Yeah, it's still fresh, never flexed clichés
I never write a verse and repeat the same thing
'Cause the sheen on my chains is my calling to fame
Made in the projects, slave to my progress
I only fuck a black girl if she wearing contacts
You ain't gotta talk you still blocked from my contacts
She hit me on my MySpace she ever wanna find me
I'm way too fly to drive, too drunk to call a cab
But I still need a ride to fit a couple girls inside
Oh what am I to do? I rent an Uber for the week
It's just another whip on my back, and we don't pay no tax
'Cause where I come from, ain't no body getting shot by the IRS
The trap ain't free, better realize that
But I'ma get money, no tests on the desk
Fuck the SATs, smoking Sunday's best
Find me in the ground, only time I regress
Six feet down, no I'm not there yet
Won't you meet me in the grave? I got grass on deck
So a grave like a slaveship, candy colored spaceship
Space like a white girl but ride like a Lexus
Leather with an accent, designed by Italians
But he ain't got medallions, so maybe he a Mexican
But really what's the difference?

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
I don't know difference
Mirror black and white like a pilgrim
Plymouth landed on me like a kickflip
Y'all repress this, oppress this
Question next is why my mentions so menstrual?
I be going ham on Ray Street eating tofu
Loiter at the Whole Foods, sipping kombucha
Yeah, I went green but the black'll still do ya
Damn, she used to be my number one, past tense
Past time chillin', evolved into the villain
Sunday school friends in search of second circumcisions
Nah, keep your opinions
We was mall rats just cheesin' for the pictures
Now who can circumvent us?

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
Dun-dun-dun-dun
Dun-dun, dun-dun

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Let 'em in, kill 'em then
They proud of all my fuckin' friends, missing me
I think I fell in love again in Michigan
(And the whip right there and it's parked outside)
Let 'em in, kill 'em then
They proud of all my fuckin' friends, missing me
I think I fell in love again in Michigan
(And the whip right there and it's parked outside)

[Hook: Kevin Abstract]
Let us stay for more pain
Let us stay for more rain
Let us stay for more brain
Let us stay for more brain
Let us stay for more days
Let us stay for more pain
Let us pray for more rain
Let us pray for more rain

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
But who really knows, yeah? (let us stay for more pain)
But who really knows? (let us stay for more pain)

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Wild child
Been alone for a while now
If you gotta turn it down, down
Wild child
Been alone for a while now
If you gotta turn it down, down
(And the whip right there and it's parked outside)

[Break: Kevin Abstract]
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high

[Outro: Kevin Abstract]
I get, I get, I get
Let us stay for more brain
And I get, I get, I get
Let us pray for more rain
Let us stay for more pain
Let us stay for more brain
Let us stay for more rain
(I been waiting for you)
Let us stay for more days
Let us stay for more pain
Let us pray for more rain
(I'm always lookin' for you)

[Intro: Merlyn Wood]
You fired, you fired (For Joie!)
Shawty shot, shawty, shawty shot, shawty, shawty shot
Shawty shot, shawty, shawty shot, shawty, shawty shot
Shawty shot, shawty, shawty shot
Shawty shot me out the atmosphere, well this one year
I was flyin' high in the pimp plane atmosphere
Shy, shawty, shawty shy, shawty shy, shawty, shawty shy
Shawty, shawty shy, shawty shy, shawty, shawty shy
Shawty, shawty shot me out the sky, well this one year
I was flyin' high in the pimp plane atmosphere

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood & Kevin Abstract]
If she could, she could see my final form
I could see you Majin Buu-in' on my Dragon Balls
What you need a map and backpack just to find the one?
Dora, Dora, come home, you been searchin' too long

[Verse 1: Rodney Tenor]
Shit, high-waist jeans with a kid
Shorty always flexin' on the 'gram
Tight, tight jeans with a rack make me go on a rant
Shawty, but your attitude rank
Drunk at the club with your girls only here for the drinks
Untouchable data, unmeasurable playa'
God, the moderator, I ain't sayin', I'm hittin'
I was just wondering if I could call at your number
If I was ever in trouble, if I could take you home
I ain't a doper, you ain't a smoker
I'm hopin' to get to know you
I'm wonderin' if I could get you gone, girl
I was lookin' for ride-or-dies
And there you came through
With your fine disguise, yeah, yeah
I ain't fuckin' around no more
Don't hear me, all she hear was sha-la-la-la

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood & Kevin Abstract]
If she could, she could see my final form
I could see you Majin Buu-in' on my Dragon Balls
What you need a map and backpack just to find the one?
Dora, Dora, come home, you been searchin' too long

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
We all gonna die one day, man ain't that crazy? (that cray)
She said thats an odd way convince me to be your lady
That be why you bae, but you is not my baby
I met these three black girls: Ocian, Jurnee, and Mercedes
One's a queen, one's narcoleptic, and one is crazy
Pickin' one lover's just like pickin' one daisy
I need at least a dozen in my DMs on the daily
Why get your nose stuck in one when you can sniff the bouquet?

[Outro: Joba]
La, la, la, la, ooo-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, ooo-la, la, la, la-ah
La, la, la, la, ooo-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, ooo-la, la, la, la-ah
La, la, la, la, (baba-bum-bum) ooo-la, la, la, la (bad-a-bum-bum)
La, la, la, la, (baba-bum-bum) ooo-la, la, la, la (bad-a-bum-bum)
La, la, la, la, (ba-ba) ooo-la, la, la, la (ba-ba, ba-ba)

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
So I built you a house

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Tryna find revenge in the dark
I think I know where you went
Tryna find your spirit is hard
I think I know how to spend
My weeks are evil
Your brother don't want me here
Your family hates me
My parents don't know I'm here
It'd be better if you loved me
But he told me love myself and that's true
It'd be nice if you could help me
But he told me help myself and that's true
The sky ain't gon' be fixed tonight
I know for sure the sky ain't perfect (Ohh)

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I'm swimmin' in a sea of regret
The more I sink I forget how to swim
I try to breathe, I know the feeling too well
Of fighting myself, I'm losing again
Why am I here? Cold and alone
The sea ain't a home, but it's still where I lay
And still to this day, bad credit with karma
Lighting blunts underwater
Still ain't goin' too well, so I keep to myself

[Mashed-up Samples]

[Spoken Word: Ariel Wendt]
Through the quicksand, the wind, and the bush in between
Someone has to shine
The boys of the wild found each other during their time of need
And chose to turn to each other in order to grow
Learn, learn, share, hope
Running away from home, facing the fears of the real world
Maintaining to hold on to the idea that connected them all to this is difficult
Challenging, there's something different in the air
The clouds are changing, weapons, love, heartbreak, and everything in between
Dirty, filthy boys
Don't let this one die

[Verse: Rodney Tenor]
I want your number in my telephone
So that I can call you all the time
I want your number in my cell phone
So that I could be the one tonight
I want your number in my telephone
So that I can call you all the time
I want your number in my cell phone
So that I could be the one tonight
I want you in my (oh, oh)
I want you in my phone, before I let you go
I want you in my phone
I want you in my, in my, in my arms again

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
On a palace floor I see my soul
Banging through the doors, we swing 'em closed
We need glass or something strong
For the creeps when you come 'round

[Bridge: Bearface]
I feel like fucking on the west side like bullets out a gun
And this drink is coming right about twice as strong
Yeah, I know you say I miss it but come on baby please
Just know you come off strong, your soul is getting lost

[Chorus: Joba]
I wish you knew me
I wish you knew
I’m everything I am
I’m everything I am
But you don’t know me
I’m everything I am
With everything I am
You don’t know me

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Hold me down, I know I've lost control
Picking up all of my dirty bones
Oh I know there's something wrong
Freak me out when you come round

[Bridge: Bearface]
I feel like fucking on the west side like bullets out a gun
And this drink is coming right about twice as strong
Yeah, I know you say I miss it but come on baby please
Just know you come off strong, your soul is getting lost

[Chorus: Joba]
I wish you knew me
I wish you knew
I’m everything I am
I’m everything I am
But you don’t know me
I’m everything I am
With everything I am
You don’t know me

[Outro: Joba]
At all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all (You don't know)
At all, at all, at all, at all

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Flip, flip mo nigga
Flip, flip phone
Flip, flip mo nigga
Flip, flip phone

[Verse 1: Merlyn Wood]
I just dropped out, I got my liberty
Acting like hot celebrity, actually I'm a rapper
Please, you a drop out?
No food in your mouth now
No weed in your mouth now
And no you in your mom's house
That don't sound so bad now
'Cause you ain't got no more bed now
And all them niggas you banked on
Is backing out like a ringtone, that's pop, lock and drop it
So I had to take that pot and ziploc it

[Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Flip, flip mo nigga
Flip, flip phone
Flip, flip mo nigga
Flip, flip phone

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I'm smoking blunts with Barack
Money inside of a sock
Stage diver holding my cock
You busy holding the block
And I've been refining my vision
You make the decision
We flexing in public, you love it
It's bullshit around me
I'm living above it
We too busy getting these buckets, nigga
Higher than the summit for the nuggets, nigga
Work on the canvas like Samo
I'm off the chain like I'm Django
Never been one for the labels
What do you bring to the table?
Nigga, stop speaking in fables
I'm a young misfit looking for the quick flip
Left hook take you out of this district
Watch a nigga's soul leave his existence
Hit a lick then I hop on my nimbus
Vicious

[Outro: Merlyn Wood]
Flip, flip mo nigga

[Chorus: Dom McLennon]
Falling for the wrong one
Feeling like the right time
But at least I felt something
Think I’m losing my mind

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
I’m in need of your love, I just need you right here
Sharing all of those things, whispering in my ear
Tell me what they can’t know, show me what they can’t see
Tell me all the ideas, they would never believe
You see I remember my home
I remember those trees, I remember those pasts
I remember the breeze, I remember the reason why all of those people that passed
Remember you opened your heart for a second
Gave me your time for a minute
Remember the tone in your voice when I told you that I might be coming to visit
But maybe I’m tripping
You catching me slipping
Down this road again
But this time I ain't falling
First day back 'cause the demons keep calling
Look at this world and I start withdrawing
And its so hard not to fade, see its so hard not to fall
But I gotta find peace
And I gotta find sleep 'cause I don’t see it at all
So I’m going, going, going, deeper and deeper
You see I’m finding it out before my spirit gets weaker
I got a fever, fever
Been feeling sick in the head
I need a doctor, doctor
Or just one more cigarette
I’m saying

[Chorus: Dom McLennon]
Falling for the wrong one (I love you)
Feeling like the right time (I love you)
But at least I felt something
Think I’m losing my mind

[Bridge: Dom McLennon]
If I die alone, then I probably deserve that
You can turn your face up but don’t act like you ain't heard that
If I die alone, then I probably deserve that
You can turn your face up but don’t act like you ain't heard that
If I die alone, then I probably deserve that
You can turn your face up but don’t act like you ain't heard that
If I die alone, then I probably deserve that
You can turn your face up but don’t act like you ain't heard that

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Oh yeah she fine
Soft from behind
Like I’m running out of time
Yeah she hurt your fucking feelings with that
Ass of hers
Dunno just to what I’m feeling with uh-
Get on her
How cannot tell I’m feeling its like-
I’m in her
World, living, breathing
You know I’m not even Steven
'Cause I could not be
Shia born in a house fire, damn
Baby, where you do that
I'ma little bit insane, yeah
Put you on game, yeah
Make you maintain, yeah
Stay up in your lane, yeah
Whatever you say, yeah
Alway-always say yeah
Rather see me dead, yeah
Than see me in your bed yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Matt Champion]
You are just poison, I put that on my grave
No need for aggression, I just need to behave
But your love is poison, I put that on my soul
Pull me down with seduction, I know that you want control

[Verse: Ameer Vann]
You are my drugs, you are what I need
The love of my life, you kiss me, I bleed
At night when I fiend, I'm grinding my teeth
I get high when you speak, if I could jump I could fly
It's so cold in the clouds, but I stay in the sky
And I see you on the ground, I guess it wasn't the same
You know I smoke and you drank, we ain't one in the same
I can't remember your name, but I remember your scent
And I remember your face, and I remember the…
And I remember the days, we wasn't stuck in our ways
Not a subject for change, I'm just a rat in your maze
And your venom’s to blame

[Chorus: Matt Champion]
You are just poison, I put that on my grave
No need for aggression, I just need to behave
But your love is poison, I put that on my soul
Pull me down with seduction, I know that you want control

[Outro: Joba]
Poison, poison
Poison, poison

BDP Posse
Talk to 'em KRS

[Verse]
Fight back, shoot back, loot that, protest
Brick to the helmet, I ain't feeling no stress
Going up against the cops, I ain't wearing no vest
The city where I come from makes your life hopeless
We're trying to stay focused, go to school, listen
But for us, school is just another pre-prison
The only way the people listen is when they're threatened
So grab your weapon, it'll be on in a second
Class warfare, yeah, we got it all here
The poor gettin' so poor they cannot even bear
The rich gettin' so rich they cannot even share
Or give an equal share to those that got 'em there

[?] right, pay what's right
You got the microphone today, my brother, you gotta say what's right
You know the cops work for the first class, not the rear class
So they get the protection and we get the tear gas

[Verse 1]
I could never put my finger on the moment
You turned to a statue
I know you probably thought I noticed that in fact
You had turned into stone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Pray tell, pray tell
Where did you go?

[Chorus]
I've lost all faith
Now that you're gonna look me in the face
So sick, sick of these lies you used to hide behind
There's no love in your skies of rain

[Verse 2]
I had always hoped that there would be more
To you than guilt trips and raindrops
Every single time I think of you
It leaves me feeling alone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Farewell, farewell
It took me so long

[Chorus]
I've lost all faith
Now that you're gonna look me in the face
So sick, sick of these lies you used to hide behind
There's no love in your skies of rain

[Bridge]
And it's all gone, the connection between us
We're washed up as the driftwood on beaches
And you make no amend
I have no faith in a single word you say

[Chorus]
So sick, sick of these lies you used to hide behind
There's no love in your skies of rain
There's no love in your skies of rain

[Intro]
So you ain't learned a lesson?
You ain't learned a lesson?
Aight, let's go!

[Verse 1]
You got bars for me?
Fuck the cash, my nigga, I'll whip that ass for free
Fuck a million dollar battle, I make your car rattle
You ain't makin' no money on me, slave, you a chattel
Me? I'm a freeman, where your shows at?
I took you out in eighty-six and the whole world knows that
For thirty years, nigga, you ain't spittin' no rap
Queensbridge hates your ass, you can't go back
You flow wack, and let me say this for my Black kids
Technically, I ain't take you out, Shan, the crack did
So gather 'round for the celebrity roast
I killed Shan already, so this must be his ghost
I still got it and gat it
Cause of you, the Bridge was over, 'til Nas came back with Illmatic
You don't even rap good, G you not hood
You're the opposite of Nas, just spell your name backwards

[Ad-lib]
You still ain't get the lesson
You still ain't get it

[Verse 2]
One hit, two hit, three hit, four hit
Shan, you need to forfeit, you already lost it
Face that shit, taste that shit
Hip-hop didn't need your career, so I erase that shit
You done, the only way you gonna win this battle
Is if you bite my name and call yourself Shan One
With the "W," but you don't even think that fast
I'm the first and the last, you’re the worst from the past
I'm the blast, master, KRS-One
What's up? After thirty years, you just stand up?
After thirty-somethin' years, you just man up?
S-H-A-N is still hugging a nut
What the fuck? You called my wife out? Man that's so whack
Blaow, nigga hold that! Blaow, nigga hold that!
See, I be going like the ocean, you a crab
Now bow your head down like you was doin' a dab

[Chorus]
Dropped outta school now we dumb rich (Dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (One shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (Pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (Lifestyle)

[Verse 1]
Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it (Do not make it)
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum (They do, they do)
And I like to finish what you think you started
Man you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
You've still got my number, girl you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl, let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me cause they never got me

[Verse 2]
They still out to get me, I don't get it
I can not be got, and that's a given
Give a real nigga the number one
Even though I got like twenty-one
Cannot be me I'm a one-of-one
Schooling your ass like 101
They been out here tryna slide on me
They been out here telling lies on me
Everybody looking out for themself
But they still got they eyes on me
See me putting in the hard work now, ayy
Momma doesn't have to call work now, ayy
I decide when I start work now, ayy
Problems hit the gym, they all work out
MVP, MVP, oh-nine all the way to sixteen
Even next season looking like a breeze
Lot of y'all ain't built for the league, yeah
Trade you off the team while you in your sleep, yeah
Y'all showed me that nothing's guaranteed
And you don't know what you started
My friend's chain so big that he look like the artist
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me cause they never got me

[Chorus]
Dropped outta school now we dumb rich (Dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (One shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (Pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (Lifestyle)

[repeated 4x]
Mama

Mama, I grew old today
I saw how hairs turned grey
I saw the price we pay
Mama, this anarchistic decay
As these social schemes start to fray
Realizing there's taxes to pay
But will my fiery heart stay or I break
Will my fiery heart stay or I break

Mama, I'm waving teenage years goodbye
Sure I've enjoyed the ride
Sure I've enjoyed the ride

[repeated 2x]
It's been wide eyes, late nights
Quick tongue, expressive lungs

[?]
Open heart, quick to part
Euphoric smile for a while

[repeated 3x]
Will my fiery heart stay or I break
There once was an island
further than any boat had reached
and she sat there in silence
alone but at ease
a spell was upon her
her body could never leave
but her mind would travel multitudes
you and I could not conceive
when the night sky's your only friend
when you're tired of playing pretend
when the ground under your feet
seems like no more than a dream
and you're in over your head
and your instincts are not fed
well, you're not free
you don't feel free
there's no time to be
on that island with me
far away from the city
from the litter and poverty
from the fast paced monotony

[Verse 1]
I'm standing close to you
We got the city breaking down
Stuck in an avalanche
We got the whole world shaking

[Refrain]
Young, I want it free
Got everything we need
A thousand shooting stars
And many mysteries
And you know we got more to show
The planets are aligned
We got something divine
So open up the sky
You know this is our time
Oh, now you know

[Pre-Chorus]
We gotta live right now
Jumping off the edge
Don't ever slow us down for nothing
We wanna live right now
Jumping off the edge
We're gonna live our lives for something more

[Chorus]
Hey, let's explo-o-o-ode, (explode)!
'Cause we got that dynamite inside our bones
Come on, let's explo-o-o-ode, (explode)!
Now we got that 1, 2, 3, come on, let's go!
Let's go!
Oh oh!
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I love this energy
We're burning up like fire
Like electricity
We're hanging from the wire

[Refrain]
Young, I want it free
Got everything we need
A thousand shooting stars
And many mysteries
And you know we got more to show
The planets are aligned
We got something divine
So open up the sky
You know this is our time
Oh, now you know

[Pre-Chorus]
We gotta live right now
Jumping off the edge
Don't ever slow us down for nothing
We wanna live right now
Jumping off the edge
We're gonna live our lives for something more

[Chorus]
Hey, let's explo-o-o-ode, (explode)!
'Cause we got that dynamite inside our bones
Come on, let's explo-o-o-ode, (explode)!
Now we got that 1, 2, 3, come on, let's go!
Let's go!
Oh oh!
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
We're gonna live right now
We wanna live right now

[Chorus]
Hey, let's explo-o-o-ode, (explode)!
'Cause we got that dynamite inside our bones
Come on, let's explo-o-o-ode, (explode)!
Now we got that 1, 2, 3, come on, let's go!
Let's go!
Oh oh!

[Verse 1: Tank]
Yeah, I'm kissing, I'm sweating, I'm licking all over your body
Yeah, who else gon' beat it like me? Keith Sweat, nobody
Yeah, he was good but I'm really nice
Yeah, you let me shoot a deep blank on his life

Yeah, and then I ran off on that pussy twice (Oh, shit)
You always let me in, I got that slick talk
Keep that good wood on me, you loving that stick talk, stick talk
Used to think that we were so the same

No ho shit, cause I'm a real nigga

Just hold on tight to me, girl
Fuck you back to sleep, girl, ooh yeah, rock you back

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Both fell asleep looking so crazy, like blah blah blah
'Til 6 o'clock in the morning we was going in, like shots shots shots
Hit it from the back on my end tops
But now I'm sober, so baby girl, turn over, oh-woah
'Bout to go down, something like a drop top
Taste so sweet, I'll be calling that a Pop Tart (Oh)
Just let me rock
You get some sleep, I'll drive

Gangsta leaning in it (Oh), going crazy (Oh)

Just hold on tight to me, girl
Oh, fuck you back to sleep, girl (Woah), rock you back (Ow!)

[Verse 3: Anthony Hamilton]
Hard for me to ignore, but I'm really all into you
Staring in your eyes, hugging on your waist like a man should
Can't wait for you to come over, let's get it started on the sofa
Hot thighs, long, strong loving, girl, I'm gonna put it on you
And I'm here to represent, girl
Leave you lying there shaking 'til you just can't take it
And I'm here to put it down, girl
Let me work on you, go to work on you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Just let me rock (And let me love you, baby, oh yeah)
Fuck you back to sleep, girl, oh
Don't say a word, no, girl, don't you talk (Ooh, ha!)
Just hold on tight to me, girl
I'll fuck you back to sleep, girl, and rock you back

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Ain't sorry that I woke ya (Yeah), I ain't sorry 'bout ya job (Fuck you back to sleep, gir, oh, yeah, yeahl)
Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love (Rock you back, oh)
Ain't sorry that I woke ya (Yeah), I ain't sorry 'bout ya job (Fuck you back to sleep, girl, ooh)
Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love

[Verse 1: Joba & Kevin Abstract]
Your lipstick burns my lips
But I think I'm still in love with you
Your eyes drip black
But I think you're still in love with me
But it feels like there's no air to breathe again (In the pink skies)
And it feels like I'm drowning in love again (I can't swim)
I'm afraid I'll lose all that I have again (Her eyes were red)
But I'm ready for the truth (Love me not)

[Chorus: Joba]
I'm so lost in love (la la, la la)
I'm so lost in love (la la, la la)
I'm so lost in love (la la, la la)
I'm so lost in love (la la, la la)

[Bridge: Joba]
I've been a fool (ooo, aa-aah)

[Verse 2: Joba & Kevin Abstract]
You say I care too much
But what does that even mean
You say I need some space
But what does that mean for me
It feels like I've fallen and fell again (the car crash)
And it feels like there's no hope for us again (you were high as hell)
I'm afraid you'll leave me for a better man (I try my hardest)
But I'm ready for the truth (love me not)

[Chorus: Joba]
I'm so lost in love (la la, la la)
I'm so lost in love (la la, la la)
I'm so lost in love (la la, la la)
I'm so lost in love (la la, la la)

[Outro: Joba & Kevin Abstract]
My head was spinning (I've been a fool)
I lost, I lost it (I've been a fool)
I've been a fool (ooo, aa-ah)
Ah-ha-ha

[Hook] (x2)
(Ah!) West side keep it thuggin' like
After me there will never be another like (Hell yeah!)
Bad hoes, palm trees, bomb weed
Stack cheese, I'm the original (Gangsta!)

[Verse 1]
The first nigga with an attitude
With thirty mil' sold, where the fuck the gratitude?
Huh, I see all these little BG's
Mean muggin' on the screen, tryna be me
Huh, I'm much more than 6-4's
Gun talk, chronic leaves and thick hoes
That's why most of them have come and went
I just recoup, recreate and reinvent
Nigga, welcome to the west coast
We home of the jackers and the best smoke
And ain't no nigga better than Doc Dre, I'm a twenty-year veteran
Bitch I run this whole time zone
'Bout to show these young niggas how to grind homes
I hope you got it while you had the chance
Your run's over, now get ready for the aftermath

[Hook]
(Ah!) West side keep it thuggin' like
After me there will never be another like (Hell yeah!)
Bad hoes, palm trees, bomb weed
Stack cheese, I'm the original (Gangsta!)
I ride for this shit, and I'll die for this shit
And I'll ride for this shit, and I'll die...

I don't want to be like what everyone else be like
If that means I gotta be like what everyone else be like then I don't want to be liked
If I gotta be like, what everybody else be like
Then I don't want to be liked
I don't want to be liked
Because I was so...
Dig down in your soul
And look to the sky above
Being liked is nothing, when you could be loved
God is love
God is love
God is love
God is love
So I would rather follow God than to follow the media
I would rather follow God than to follow perception
Because most artists aren't appreciated in their own time
So the more and more and more I'm disliked, the better I must be doing
Because most artists aren't appreciated in their own time
So the more and more I'm disliked, the much, the better I must be doing
You know why? Because I don't want to be liked
If that means, I gotta be like the way everyone else be like
The way everyone else sees like
The way everyone else does...
I've got my own vision and make my own decisions
And don't ask for permission, and I am on a mission
I am on a mission
I only want to do it on my conditions
I only want to do it my way
I'm only going to do it His way
I'm only going to do it this way
I'm only going to do it this way
I'm only going to do it this way
If you love someone tonight
Hold on to it
If you love someone tonight
Hold on, hold on real tight
Hold on, hold on real tight
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah, always find, yeah, always find, yeah, always find something...
So you've been puttin' with this just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most

Exceptions just for you, you get more than 1Night
Oooh, you get more than 1Night, you get my life
Oh love, whole life, our life, my love

[Verse 2:]
There's something about you
So special I don't know what it is

My story's unwriteable, it's true, true for you

[Outro]
Oh love
Oh love, I need your love
Oh love, All of my love
Oh love
Oh love, I need your love
Oh love
ForewordThere's an old poem by Neruda that I've always been captivated by, and one of the lines in it has stuck with me ever since the first time I read it. It says "love is so short, forgetting is so long." It's a line I've related to in my saddest moments, when I needed to know someone else had felt that exact same way. And when we're trying to move on the moments we always go back to aren't the mundane ones. They are the moments you saw sparks that weren't really there, felt stars aligning without having any proof, saw your future before it happened, and then saw it slip away without any warning. These are moments of newfound hope, extreme joy, intense passion, wishful thinking, and in some cases, the unthinkable letdown. And in my mind, every one of these memories looks the same to me. I see all of these moments in bright, burning red.

My experiences in love have taught me difficult lessons, especially my experiences with crazy love. The red relationships. The ones that went from zero to a hundred miles per hour and then hit a wall and exploded. And it was awful. And ridiculous. And desperate. And thrilling. And when the dust settled, it was something I’d never take back. Because there is something to be said for being young and needing someone so badly, you jump in head first without looking. And there's something to be learned from waiting all day for a train that's never coming. And there's something to be proud of about moving on and realizing that real love shines golden like starlight, and doesn't fade or spontaneously combust. Maybe I’ll write a whole album about that kind of love if I ever find it. but this album is about the other kinds of love that I’ve recently fallen in and out of. Love that was treacherous, sad, beautiful, and tragic. But most of all, this record is about love that was red.1. State Of Grace

[Intro: Action Bronson]
Yeah! Bam Bam
Live from Jamaica
Uh, yeah

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
I'm feelin' like the Phantom of the Opera
Hangin' from the ladder of the chopper
I might splatter if I drop
They say I look Spanish in the drop
700 horses go "VROOM" then I vanish off the block
Now I'm in the store playin' lotto in a wife beater
One sock on, chancletas
Screamin', "You better give me my cheddar before I break shit"
Man let me stop, it's only good vibrations
How could I be mad at this view?
Strange patterns in the skies, snakes that fly
The mothafuckin' stakes are high
Look the other way when jakes roll by
For my birthday, put a hundred thousand in the cake, oh my
I think I might flip into the ocean
Press the pedal of the M3, yellow
Soundin' like explosions, baby girl, don't play with my emotions
Don't baby, don't baby

[Hook: Jah Tiger]

[Verse 6: Meyhem Lauren]
White rum and Ting, Magnum and tonic
Jamaica to Jamaica, goddamn, it's so ironic
Shots of JB at the 'dega party
Uh, can't walk, I can stagger hardly
Rasta tanktop, lookin' like it's '92
Mr. 2 Face, rasclot, we gon' find you
I'm livin' off the land like the Ital man
How to stay alive? That's a vital plan
Black sand beach, Boston Bay snapper
Curry on the lobster, jerk is comin' after
Take a shot of Jager, bone slide with a slide
Everything irie, there ain't no fuckin' up my vibe
June plum juice drippin' down my chest
Open off a bad girl, damn I'm such a mess
Flex with the top down, I'm doin' the pepper seed
Ask the dread who got the better weed

[Bridge: Action Bronson & Meyhem Lauren]
Freak dancin' in the basement, grindin' in the hallway
That's right, we do it all day
Freak dancin' in the basement, grindin' in the hallway
That's right, we do it all day

[Outro]
Give me your love
Give me your love

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
It's over, it's really over
Kobe really retired, it's crazy!
It's just a trip to even be doing this right now
Kobe really retiring

[Director]
Call in marks, Kendrick take one

[Kendrick Lamar]
What can I say?
I mean really, what can we say?
Day by day, season by season, twenty, to be exact
Growing up watching him paint murals
Using this building as his first studio
Using L.A. as his canvas
Restoring crowns back to where they belong
Under royal banners, purple and gold
The color of royalty
My one man L.A. king

[Announcer]
Back to Kobe, fallaway pull up
Oh! What a way to finish!

[Kendrick Lamar]
Kobe
Never meaningless could never mean less
That's what he means at this moment
All season has been his goodbye
Him to us, us to him, to the whole world

[Sample from untitled 07]

Still got magic, but he made it magical
From Compton to Crenshaw
Jack to Jeanie
We were all witnesses
To all things that was him
I mean, we shared with him the world

[Announcer]
Kobe, inside the three point arc...
Kobe Bryant has hit a shot at the buzzer!

[Kobe Bryant]
WOO!

[Kendrick Lamar]
Soon enough, he became our identity
If you wasn't born and raised here
Or never lived here
You probably would never understand
I'm-a make sure you do

I'm talking about the 81 points
I'm talking about the afro
I'm talking about the alleyoop to Shaq
The off-glass buzzer beater over D-Wade
The game four overtime takeover in the Finals

Kobe
I'm talking about the posterizing of Steve Nash
I'm talking about Dwight Howard's rookie year when he got baptized
You remember that
Kobe bodied him
The helicopter
The five parades
Kobe

[Sample from untitled 07]

The mashed-up gamut of emotions with you and with ourselves is so deep
I don't think nobody can break that bond
So I ask, how do empires last when there's no longer an emperor?
I mean, we got you
But at the same time, we got you
I'm talking about your blood, your sweat, your tears
Even your DNA is placed in these L.A. concretes, man
And nothing would ever replace that or erase that
Forever great in our hearts
So with that being said
Know that it's never goodbye
It's simply respect due
Our due, forever
Kobe

[Verse 1: Nai Palm]
Graphite to paper
A saga-born, hand-drawn artisan dreamer
Graphite to paper
A saga-born anhedron artisan dreamer
Miyazaki frontier
A crystal-clear picture of aluminum seeker

This view from here is airborne

[Verse 2: Nai Palm]
Mystic catacomb creeper
Who whispers stone cold
And as the mind follows deeper
A relic, a teacher
A talisman in the hand
Navigate to seek up above

[Chorus: Nai Palm]
Laputa
(Miss you)
Laputa

Floating castle in the sky (miss you)

But the riot hunts for you, you, you, you
I've been running, running
But the riot hunts for you, you, you, you

But the riot hunts for you, you, you, you
For you-do-do-do-do

[Verse 3: Anderson .Paak]
Up above the overlord
That's my city lifting overboard
The queen in tattered clothing
She dreams of music overtures
She's drifting over fog
Crystals in the magnetic molding
They'd love to take your charm
Corruption is at large
So good god, keep floating
I missed the mark
I was lost in a numbers game
I had my head in the cloud 'til the summertime
But when my high came down, you were done with me
And oh Ms. Juilliard
Acting as if I'm the only
Attracted to the paintings you show me
The tattoos on your palms

[Outro: Anderson .Paak + (Nai Palm)]
And it would be a lie if I said I didn't mind or (miss you)
Blinded by something so prideful
Words can't define (how I miss you)
How did you get so high and out of my reach?
(How I miss you)
Floating castle, won't you save a place for me in the sky
(Miss you)
Floating castle, won't you save a place for me in the sky
(How I miss you)
How'd you get so high and out of my reach?
Floating castle, won't you save a place for me in the sky?
Out of my reach

[Intro]
And so I've arrived
With gold in my eyes
Are you paying attention?

[Chorus]
I was searching for something
As I watched you run
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone?
As I watched you go
I am mad because I don't know what you used me for
I've been looking for so long
In Amerika
Throw my hands in the air

[Verse 1]
Flash faded
Say you care, but you don't
You know I hate it
It's a rich kid game, didn't grow up with a throne
It's all it really is

[Chorus]
I was searching for something
As I watched you run
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone?
As I watched you go
Are you mad because I don't know what you used me for?
Always talking about one day
In Amerika
Same old story, oh
You want glory, son
I've been looking for so long
But you cut me out
Throw my hands in the air 'cause I—

[Verse 2]
Your palace
All the friends you own
So jealous
Felt that rich kid pain, what it is to be alone
It's all it really is

[Chorus]
I was searching for something
As I watched you run
I was sad when you said that you never really wanted some
Were you looking for someone?
As I watched you go
Are you mad because I don't know what you used me for
Always talking about one day
In Amerika
Same old story, oh
You want glory, son

[Outro]
In Amerika, in Amerika
In Amerika, in Amerika
In Amerika, in Amerika

Ah yeah
Ah yeah

[Verse 1]
He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

[Chorus]
'Cause I’m hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Verse 2]
You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can’t let me know I'm wanted
Can’t let me in your head
I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's praise that I get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I’m coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven

Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Bridge]
Oh, you're down right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there

'Cause you're looking so right there
Baby, you should touch me right there
If you take me right there
We could make it

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?

Know you're bad for me, but you know I am too
Me and you together, like a loved up bruise
I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
Baby, you're okay
Baby, you're okay
No, you won't, won't go breaking my heart
You've seen that we got the same pain, same scar
Felt that when we got closer in the dark
Baby, I'm okay
Baby, I'm okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, when
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you

[Chorus]
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

[Verse 2]
Nothing could stop us, we got it all
The love, the passion, but most of all
We mess up, but run from the scene
But I throw my hands up, if you know what I mean
Ah, 'cause I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong
And I know that you miss me when I'm gone
We make a great team
With you, I'm badder than I've ever been

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, when
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you

[Chorus]
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

[Bridge]
Let's be bad, babe
Let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe
Let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe
Let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe

[Chorus]
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

[Intro]
Ohhhh, ahhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh
Ummmm, ohhhh

[Verse 1]
Hold on, let me explain
Sometimes I just don't know what to believe in
And I hate things that I said, I didn't mean them (Hm-hm)
So difficult tryna piece my thoughts
Don't wanna be no burden, I always piss you off
How could a man not wanna disappear? (Hmm)

[Chorus]
I'm exposed and I am pure
No one makes me feel secure
Except you and now we're all in
All in, I am all in
Whatever happens, happens
We're all in, all in
I am all in
Whatever happens, happens

[Verse 2]
Why all the fussin', I can explain
I know your heart is all in no one takes your place
I hate the man that I was, so unbecoming (Hm-hm)
We're learning together anyhow
We're learning together right now
Facing the man that I was, tired of running

[Chorus]
I'm exposed and I am pure
No one makes me feel secure
Except you and now we're all in
All in (We're all in deep, baby), I am all in
Whatever happens, happens
We're all in, all in
I am all in
Whatever happens, happens

[Outro]
Happens, happens, happens, happens, happens
All in, all in, all in
Happens, happens, happens, happens, happens
All, all in, all in, all in, all in, all in
Whatever happens, happens
Prologue'Speak now or forever hold your peace,' the words said by preachers at the end of wedding ceremonies all over the world, right before the vows. It's a last chance for protest, a moment that makes everyone's heart race, and a moment I've always been strangely fascinated by. So many fantasize about bursting into a church, saying what they'd kept inside for years like in the movies. In real life, it rarely happens.

Real life is a funny thing, you know. In real life, saying the right thing at the right moment is beyond crucial. So crucial, in fact, the most of us start to hesitate, for fear of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. But lately what I've begun to fear more than that is letting the moment pass without saying anything.

I think most of us fear reaching the end of our life, and looking back regretting the moments we didn't speak up. When we didn't say 'I love you.' When we should've said 'I'm sorry.' When we didn't stand up for ourselves or someone who needed help.

These songs are made up of words I didn’t say when the moment was right in front of me. These songs are open letters. Each is written with a specific person in mind, telling them what I meant to tell them in person. To the beautiful boy whose heart I broke in December. To my first love who I never thought would be my first heartbreak. To my band. To a mean man I used to be afraid of. To someone who made my world very dark for a while. To a girl who stole something of mine. To someone I forgive for what he said in front of the whole world.

Words can break someone into a million pieces, but they can also put them back together. I hope you use yours for good, because the only words you’ll regret more than the ones left unsaid are the ones you use to intentionally hurt someone.

What you say might be too much for some people. Maybe it will come out all wrong and you’ll stutter and you’ll walk away embarrassed, wincing as you play it all back in your head. But I think the words you stop yourself from saying are the ones that will haunt you the longest.

So say it to them. Or say it to yourself in the mirror. Say it in a letter you’ll never send or in a book millions might read someday. I think you deserve to look back on your life without a chorus of resounding voices saying ‘I could’ve, but it’s too late now.’

There is a time for silence. There is a time waiting your turn. But if you know how you feel, and you so clearly know what you need to say, you’ll know it.

I don't think you should wait. I think you should speak now.

Love, Taylor

[Verse 1]
You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world

[Chorus]
Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray you catch me

[Verse 2]
Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

[Chorus]
Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray to catch you whispering (Whisper, whisper)
I pray you catch me (Whisper, whisper)
I pray you catch me
I pray you catch me (Pray you)
I'm praying you catch me

[Outro]
What are you doing, my love?
I know that you can feel it
Right now
Inside your brain
So let me tell you something weird

You know I don't play
Ask me everyday
Girl, you know I don't
Roll that way

I know you can't believe it at all
But I'm not lying
So let me give you something real

You know I don't play
Ask me any day
Girl, you know I don't
Roll

[Verse 1]
I said girl
What you wanna do to me
I can be your fantasy
Tonight

I said girl
What you, what you wanna do?
It can just be me and you
Tonight tonight

[Pre-Hook]
People say it can't be found
Love is in the air right now
And you can tell I really care right now
When I touch you like that babe

[Hook]
Stay with me forever
Lay with me forever
As long as we're together
We'll be fine, we'll be fine
Stay with me forever

We'll be fine
Girl you know that we'll be fine
You can never leave my mind
Girl you know that we'll be fine

[Verse 2]
I said girl
We can take it to the floor
I'm gonna have you screaming more
Tonight

I said girl
We can lay and watch a movie
Or we can jump in the jacuzzi
Tonight

[Pre-Hook]
People say it can't be found
Love is in the air right now
And you can tell I really care right now
When I touch you like that babe

[Hook]
Stay with me forever
Lay with me forever
As long as we're together
We'll be fine, we'll be fine

Stay with me forever
Lay with me forever
As long as we're together
We'll be fine, we'll be fine

[Verse 3]
I ain't looking for a heartbreak
Now that's a feeling that I can't shake
No time for the heartache
Too busy making love on the mattress
(missing line)
It's time for the mistakes
(missing line)
I just wanna say babe

[Hook]
Stay with me forever
Lay with me forever
As long as we're together
We'll be fine, we'll be fine
Stay with me forever
Lay with me forever
As long as we're together
We'll be fine, we'll be fine

We'll be fine
Girl you know that we'll be fine
You can never leave my mind
Girl you know that we'll be fine
We're alright

(It starts off with a cathartic breathing
And the reason for it is just to move your energy and to get you out of your head and into your body and you just breathe.)

I know that you can feel it
Right now
Inside your brain
So let me tell you something weird

You know I don't play
Ask me everyday
Girl, you know I don't
Roll that way

I know you can't believe it at all
But I'm not lying
So let me give you something real

You know I don't play
Ask me any day
Girl, you know I don't
Play
(The next phase, the screaming phase, of Dynamic Meditation feels like when you've finally had an opportunity to throw a tantrum when you were a little kid.)

What is this, a party?
All the time
I thought that it was Tuesday
Every night
I guess we're getting loose, then
Do it right
Take me back to Houston

That's a nice beat
She took the heat

Don't usually do this
I'm not that sweet
Didn't really miss it

That's a nice beat
She took the heat

(Peter fucking Sagar, answer your goddamn phone
I've called you fifteen times now; I know you know what you did
You fucking sold my girlfriend some fucked up shit
I know exactly where you live, I'm coming over right now
If your girlfriend's there I'm gonna shove this shit down her throat, man
You guys are fucked. You should've never done this me;
And now my girlfriend is in the fucking hospital
She's got clinical schizophrenia and I don't know if I can date her anymore and you've ruined my relationship
So, you're fucking dead and I'm coming to get you, fuck you.)
(Oh shit, I'm so sorry)

(By the time you get to third phase of jumping up and down and yelling "hoo," you're hardly there at all
And so it's pretty hard to remember what happens when you're there
I guess the closest thing I can associate it with is mindlessness
You get to a place where your mind actually leaves your body. Your body's just jumping up and down and your voice from your gut is yelling "hoo" and you're not doing it anymore
You become one with this whole energy.")

What is this bitch saying
Saying about me
Nothing I remember
Can you see

Cause you know I wouldn't hurt you
You're my only 

[?] for me
But they won't let me see you
Though I never shot you, Chloe

(10 minutes, Uncle Jun
Who’s down there?
Artie Shaw. 10 minutes
Don’t go anywhere
I’m not, I’m right here)

(Comes a rainstorm, put your rubbers on your feet)
(You got any wine?
Cazzate, Malanga)

(The next phase in dynamic is the quite phase
Someone yells stop, and you've just been doing 30 minutes of intense catharsis
And what happens after being in such incredibly intense movement for so long is just a feeling of peacefulness and stillness
My mind actually stops, and I feel a oneness with the whole universe.)

(Welcome to the B side)
Baby, I can see that look in your eyes
And I know you wish I'd be another guy
But I can't hold your hand
And beg you'd come and be loved

She's not looking for a way out
And I had to be distant and there's no doubt
And I'm still giving her the good life
It's not right

If my baby loves me under the sheets
Yeah
My baby loves me under the sheets
Yeah
My baby should love me

Do do do oh
Do do do do do do oh
Do do do oh
Do do do do do do oh
Baby, I know I've been gone everyday
And I know I'll never know what I should say
But I can't keep doing this for years making you pay

She's not looking for a way out
And I had to be distant and there's no doubt
And I'd stop giving her the good life
It's not right

If my baby loves me under the sheets
Yeah
My baby loves me under the sheets
Yeah
My baby loves me under the sheets
Yeah
My baby loves me under the sheets
Yeah
My baby should love me

She's not looking for a way out
And I had to be distant and there's no doubt
And I'd stop giving her the good life
It's not right
If my baby loves me under the sheets

[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Ya niggas got me high
Niggas got me high

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Hey! Well that's exactly what a nigga came for
Huh, you talking shots from afar
I'ma meet you at your front door
Uh, so hard to be doing what you really meant for, beauty
Huh, but don't I make it look easy
Don't I make it look good

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
You drank up all my liquor, come on
What I'm supposed to do now?
And you talking all that shit, now come on
You gonna have to back it up
If I get too high now, sugar, come on
I might never come down
You know I might never come down
Let me get down
You might not never come down
Now let me come down
You might not never come down
Let me get down!

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
You might never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Can't beat it, can't beat it
Can't beat it, can't beat it with the big bad door
Can't see her with this pitch black Gucci frames on
Let me take these bitches off
Let me get the full scope, hold up
Huh, full screen, HD, let me take another picture
Let me pull it to the pre-show
Whoa, cool beans, cool beans
That's a whole lot of reefer
Let me help you with the pre-roll

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
You, drank up all my liquor, come on
What I'm supposed to do now?
And you talking all that shit, now come on
You gonna have to back it up
If I get too high now, sugar, come on
I might never come down
You know I might never come down
Let me get down
You might not never come down
Now let me come down
You might not never come down
Let me get down!

[Bridge: Anderson. Paak]
You might never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile
You might never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Okay now take that, Maybach, where the Wraith at?
The Bentley truck if you can pay that
A small village, you could say that
But you'd rather take your bankroll to Rodeo
Let her raid that? No, tell 'em "hell no"
Middle finger, the COINTELPRO
Stick it to the rear like it's velcro
What other country can you sell blow?
And for less than a kilo, man, you get an elbow
I'm gettin' high, never come down
Round up your rile and we'll run it down
Soon as it dries I'ma run the town
I fantasize shooting Trump down
A shot for every black man who got gunned down
By the police with no convictions, still they run 'round
When we protest they tell us pipe down
For Trayvon and Mike Brown
CNN wanna make it black/white
Cause we hit the action with a blacklight
Make them suckers act right, yeah!

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
You, drank up all my liquor, come on
What I'm supposed to do now?
And you talking all that shit, now come on
You gonna have to back it up
If I get too high now, sugar, come on
I might never come down
You know I might never come down
Let me get down
You might not never come down
Now let me come down
You might not never come down
Let me get down!

[Bridge: Anderson. Paak]
You might never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile
You might never ever come down
It took too long to get this high off the ground
Don't run, just stay awhile

[Intro]
One two, one two
Say, yes Lord!
You know it's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time coming
Coachella!

[Verse]
I'm beginning to fall in, the centre of my bases
And with a deep grin, smile in amazement
These old sneakers changed to alligators
My hand-me-down pea coat switched to velvet blazer
Born inside the igloo, my paps ice triggered (yeah!)
Lunatic was underneath the ice skater
Foolish and talking big with light 

[?]

[?] makes the stand on
I can't save them
I can't save her, though she's my favorite (yeah!)
She don't want much but to ride my wave (yeah!)
And carry my boy through 

[?]
She's gorgeous
But a whores within her DNA
It's important, to let you be who you are (yeah!)
I couldn't force it
I'm metamorphosing
Kicking it with my yellow-raging niggas, salty
I lay her down like "put 'em in a coffin!"
Go crown on my ten pound noggin (yeah!)
I could see the stars aline
And my god it's a beautiful time to be shining
On point and
Pardon me (yeah!)
I never got the option to ride or be
With this much face often
Probably the most underrated, yet elevated
Flying over Coachella in a saucer
It's fucking awesome!
(yeah!)

[Outro]
Now get your, get your hands high!
Now get your, get your hands high! (yeah!)
Get your, get your hands high!
Coachella!

[Verse]
No love is greater in this whole wide world
It's made of, It's made of, it's made of, It's made of
Say it again
No love is greater in this whole wide world
It's made of, It's made of, it's made of, It's made of

[Verse 1]
I'd sail away
Just to follow you
I'd chase the dream
Across the blue
'Cause I am rich
No matter what I lose
I'd rather risk it all to find the truth

[Chorus]
All because of, our love
All because, of our love
All because, of our love
It's all because, of our love
It's all because, of our love
Oh all because, of our love
All because, of our love
It's all because, of our love

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna change my heart
And start anew
Turn myself into someone new
If I can't be the one I choose
I'd rather leave it all
And die with you

[Chorus]
All because of, our love
All because, of our love
All because, of our love
It's all because, of our love
It's all because, of our love
Oh all because, of our love
All because, of our love
It's all because, of our love
Words got my attention
Sat inside my head a while
Now I'm gonna let it fall out
Gotta let it fall out

Not sure why you bother
Guess it must have bothered you
I can always let it fall out
So I'm gonna let it fall out

Didn't feel better
In a minute 

[?]
Got your fingers 

[?] right out
Now I've gotta let it fall out

Just in case you're feelin'
Like you wanna keep it up
Gonna spend it right then

[?] if I would stand for you

'Cause no one wants to hear it
Saying things to hurt
Someone is gonna feel it inside
The pain'll be the same as mine
And you know
I hope that you hate this
I know you're gonna hate it
Is that because it's time for it to end?
You can go and tell every little friend
Black Night
Black Night
'neath the silent
Starry light
Here I wait
For your footsteps now

You have taken
All my loving
That I wished you
To have
I would take yours
But I don't know how

[Chorus]
If there's a chance for
What you hoped for
And you'd dream for
And you'd plan for
How can you stand for
The heartsore
At hand?

[?]
You was a-crying
And the moonlight is dying
So I wait
For your footsteps now

[Chorus]

But now you are here
And before you're gone
Tell me where
Did you sleep last night?

Black Night

[Snippet]

[Chris Brown]
Every time I go, they keep telling me no
And life's travelling fast all around you, whispers about my past
I can tell you anything I want
But I'd rather rewrite my wrongs if I'm allowed to
So let me know if you can trust me
If you can trust me, then trust me
If you can trust me baby
If you can trust me, then trust me

[Rick Ross]
Sipping purple and I'm leaning
My bitch we up at Neimans
Still triple beam dreaming
I'mma show these hoes the meaning
Alone in the palace its just me and all the choppers
But I know they got us all these haters out here plotting
My name is Sandy; I'm 14 years old
My friends say I'm ugly
But my dad says I'm the prettiest thing
The prettiest thing
The prettiest thing
The prettiest thing
The prettiest thing

My name is Sandy; I'm 14 years old
And sometimes I hate you
But right now, I just wanna go home
Just wanna go home
Just wanna go home
Just wanna go home
Just wanna go home

My name is Sandy; I'm 14 years old
My brother says he hates me
And Satan is his master

My name is Sandy; I'm 14 years old
My insides are changing
And right now, I just wanna grow up
I just wanna grow up
I just wanna grow up
I just wanna grow up
I just wanna grow up
I just wanna grow up
I just wanna grow up
I just wanna grow up
I just wanna grow up

[Intro]
You got wires, going in
You got wires, coming out of your skin
You got tears, making tracks
I got tears that are scared of the facts

[Verse 1]
Running down corridors, through automatic doors
Got to get to you, got to see this through
I see hope is here in a plastic box
I see Christmas lights reflecting in your eyes

[Chorus]
You got wires, going in
You got wires, coming out of your skin
There's dried blood on your wrist
Your dried blood on my fingertips

[Verse 2]
Running down corridors, through automatic doors
Got to get to you, got to see this through
I see hope is here in a plastic box
I see Christmas lights reflecting in your eyes
First night of your life, curled up on your own
Looking at you now, you would never know

[Bridge]
I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes
You'll be alright
I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes
You'll be alright
Alright

[Outro]
Running down corridors, through automatic doors
Got to get to you, got to see this through
I see hope is here in a plastic box
I see Christmas lights reflecting in your eyes
Down corridors, through automatic doors
Got to get to you, got to see this through
First night of your life, curled up on your own
Looking at you now, you would never know

[Verse 1: Loyle Carner]
There was something 'bout her face
Something 'bout the way that they would taste
Little lips after slipping everything she shouldn't say
Saying everything that couldn't wait
Saying wouldn't it be great
A little bait heard a little late
Years of trying me, finally, im a slip her on a date
Saying wait, the day will break
Trying to play it straight
But she was saying wake me up at eight
Now im talking late
Jack way back when I get eczema on my elbows
Before she found shelter in the shell-toes
We felt those, lows
That Heaven in the hell holes
Waiting for a situation saying we should quell those feelings
We're feeling, cause I don't get no ease in the evening
Release when I'm dreaming
And she would say she can't believe what she's reading
Cause everything I write has been misleading, she needs him

[Chorus: Tom Misch & Loyle Carner]
She needs him
Uh-uh, she needs him
She needs him
Uh-uh, she needs him
She needs him
Uh-uh, she needs him
She needs him

[Verse 2: Loyle Carner]
It be that Friday night, fiddlin' with FIFA
Slum Village seeping through the speaker
I need her
Deeper than the reasons had to leave her
But she ain't thinking 'bout me I ain't thinking 'bout her neither either
Believe her or let it go
It seems the latter looks like losing over setting stone
Best to bell her phone
I'd rather see her but she's never home
So I start to moan
Alone, grab her breath and groan speak after the tone like
Ayo its me what you saying
Its been a week I was playing
I know this isn't good for you but another night your staying
So help me I'm just tryna find a way
It ain't no early morning lay it low no more
They say the situations straying
You're delaying, I ain't praying no more
What you playing those for
I played my cards right, twice, for nothing
No I ain't waiting no more

[Chorus: Tom Misch & Loyle Carner]
She needs him
Uh-uh, she needs him
She needs him
Uh-uh, she needs him
She needs him
Uh-uh, she needs him
She needs him
She needs him
Uh-uh, she needs him
She needs him
Uh-uh, she needs him
She needs him

[Intro: Akon]
Easy as that?
Thought I'd take her home and
Bring her right back, bro
I felt for her
I felt

[Verse 1: Akon]
I was like, two-seater, "Hello, can I meet her?"
Know that she was gold from the first time I've seen her
I was like, Mamacita
Cooler than a freezer
Come and pop that body right here on me, no meter

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
She was there right, wasn't hard to read her
In the middle of the night, watch out with Khalifa
Then I saw that apple bum, it was bigger than Vanita'
I never leave a man down, had to go retrieve her

[Chorus: Akon]
You say that we may be the one
We love hard and fight like we're done
But you know how to make me feel
You know how to make me feel
Can't lose you, this thing ain't no lie
While you mine forever will try
But you know how to make me feel
You know how to make me feel
(Sexy, sexy)

[Verse 2: Akon]
One hunnid, let's keep it one hunnid
'Cause when it's time to throw it back
She knows to return it
And when it's time to throw a stack, she waiting to burn it
The question's that's she's coming back, 'cause she know I own it

[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
You know that
You know that
You know that she bad
You know that
You know that
You know that she's that
She gave me what I wanted
While all these niggas own it
But she only had eyes for me

[Chorus: Akon]
You say that we may be the one
We love hard and fight like we're done
But you know how to make me feel
You know how to make me feel
Can't lose you, this thing ain't no lie
While you mine forever will try
But you know how to make me feel
You know how to make me feel

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
You know how, you know how
Bad bitches taught you, taught you
You know how (You know how, you know how)
Bad bitches taught you (Taught you, taught you)
You know how, yeah, 'cause I done taught you, nigga
Fuck around and I might deport you with her
Last time you started frontin', I fought you, nigga
Next time, I'ma pull out and torch you with her
Of course you with her, in the Porsche, you with her
Fuck I look like nigga? Of course she bitter
'Cause you know how I put it on, you know how I do it long
Ride it like a unicorn, schoolgirl uniform
Ass clap, not ass cap
But I got him writing songs for my ass, clap
Pussy pop, pat-pat
It don't get no bigger, it's at its max fat
We love hard, we fight like we done
Get my gun, that bitch better run
But I'm cooking up and it's deep-fried
With my G-string in your G5
It's blood gang, I'm a G, five

[Chorus: Akon]
You say that we may be the one
We love hard and fight like we're done
But you know how to make me feel
You know how to make me feel
Can't lose you, this thing ain't no lie
While you mine forever will try
But you know how to make me feel
You know how to make me feel
You say that we may be the one
We love hard and fight like we're done
But you know how to make me feel
You know how to make me feel
Can't lose you, this thing ain't no lie
While you mine forever will try
But you know how to make me feel
You know how to make me feel

Big fame with the game, man I'm certified

Don't say nothing nigga that's my bitch
Hoes say late night when it fall apart

Inner freeze and I end up with the car keys
Had to put the bomb weed, as I break a bomb bitch

But she bomb and she grown and she wanna go
So I put her in the back of a Sprinter Van
Rent-A-Center 

[?] van, yeah I went up in her man

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I'm gettin' faded in a undisclosed location
This ain't just a couple screws loose, it's straight-jacket crazy
I don't give a fuck if I don't find my head
Fuck it, I gave every single fuck I had left
Yeah, why'd you get so high so early
So high, so early
So high, so early
So high, so early?
Take your time, never hurry
You don't mind, I won't worry
You'll be fine, say the word, say the word

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Smokin' dope, it's hard to breathe
Feelin' stuck, it's hard to leave
Roll up, smoke 'em back-to-back
If you got some, we can match
Money comin', we can stack
Dime bags, twenty bags, fifties, hundreds, grab a seven
Got some extra, that's a blessin'
Roll me up, just roll me up
DJ Pour had me sippin' that sizzurp
TDot poured me up, faded off the wake up
I got makeup on my clothes
This bitch was sleep, this loud just woke her up
I don't think I smoke enough (Nah)
Cheech & Chong my motivators
Roll a facial, think of times I hoped for cable, we was broke
If I ain't have nothin', I had hella smoke (Hella smoke)
Leather coat, the fragrant's kush
Passed out faded before they played the hook
Got a foreign model tryna order out, she hate to cook (Ha)
I get high with Esco now, they shootin' shit, I made you look
My life is a movie, dropped out of school 'cause I hated books
I'm livin' like Rick James, still backwoods, ain't shit changed (Nah)
Mac know I'm far from sober, just started, it's far from over (Peace)

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I'm gettin' faded in a undisclosed location
This ain't just a couple screws loose, it's straight-jacket crazy
I don't give a fuck if I don't find my head
Fuck it, I gave every single fuck I had left
Why'd you get so high so early
So high, so early
So high, so early
So high, so early?
Take your time, never hurry
You don't mind, I won't worry
You'll be fine, say the word, say the word

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, walk in the crib, my dick smell of sex
Pussy, whiskey on my breath
My bitch buggin' when I come in, "When you gon' clean up this mess?"
See, I'm American made, there goes my brain or what's left
When I get carried away, I know how crazy I get
Cash or check, bread and butter, take a number, place a bet
To the realest motherfuckers, ain't too many of us left
You can't tell me nothin', no discussion, flow is so disgustin'
Throwin' up a whole bunch of blood on a empty stomach
Got headaches and migraines, headaches and migraines
Every single mornin', like my brain flippin' sideways
Try to move my body but my skeleton vibrates
Whose car is that and how'd it get in my driveway?
This is high stakes, professional time waste
High as Macaulay Culkin, but lower than five basements
It's competitive life ruinin' horrible influences
I stay with headaches and migraines

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I'm gettin' faded in a undisclosed location
This ain't just a couple screws loose, it's straight-jacket crazy
I don't give a fuck if I don't find my head
Fuck it, I gave every single fuck I had left
Yeah, why'd you get so high so early
So high, so early
So high, so early
So high, so early?
Take your time, never hurry
You don't mind, I won't worry
You'll be fine, say the word, say the word

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Pull up in that all black mask with the .40 on my side
Couple shots and this shit shut down
Pop a 100 bottles in the club
And we still turnt up even after the shit shut down
We gon' get wild (got that shit shut down)
We blowin' loud (got that shit shut down)
Pull up on ya (gettin' this shit shut down)
You can fuck around and get this shit shut down

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
All I do is hustle for the benefits
And with the Money Team but I don’t need a membership
I got a couple foreign lesbians up in the whips
I'm blowing loud like it was a Sega Genesis
I can tell you niggas what the business is
I bet I take a nigga food 'fore he finish it
Take an L nigga, you don't know what winnin' is
I be pushin' like I don't know what the limit is
Hit the club submarine style, in here too deep
Ballin' like a pro, sumo level on
Man that Cali's what I'm flaunting so I'm back on fleek
You ain't talkin' bout money, homie now I'm in the streets
Cause you don't know who came with the heat
Cause you and your crew lookin' weak, hey

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Pull up in that all black mask with the .40 on my side
Couple shots and this shit shut down

Pull up on ya (gettin' this shit shut down)

[Verse 2: HoodyBaby]
Run up in your trap, it's a kick though
Caught you with your pants down, this a shit show
Call me dollars starin' high, nigga let the clip go
I'll whoop a pussy nigga like Klitschko
Now my old bitch trippin', she won't let go
Say my attitude bad but my dick gold
Young nigga trap in designer
I thought I remind ya, my meat is turkey lasagna
Why I got the birds, what the business is?
Got my Lamborghini really, I don't need a bitch
I just met the plug in San Antonio
I send the bitch and the pack down to Tokyo
Same day turn around on some merri-go
And my weed so loud I can't hear ya hoe
And you know you dismissed before you exist bitch

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Pull up in that all black mask with the .40 on my side
Couple shots and this shit shut down
Pop a 100 bottles in the club

Pull up on ya (gettin' this shit shut down)
You can fuck around and get this shit shut down

[Verse 3: Young Lo]
Bitch we out here brackin', what the business is?
I just put a mili out the trap and bought the dealership
Back to back Lambs for the butter black Ghost
Told her I just want the cream, swear these niggas like toast
Bought an all red beam and it came with a scope
While these niggas talkin' chickens, I just get it out the boat
Ship it for the highest ticket, right now it's for the low
All my bitches with the shit cause I can't fuck with square hoes, low

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Pull up in that all black mask with the .40 on my side
Couple shots and this shit shut down

[Verse 4: YoungBlacc]
Look, look, I ain't never been afraid of a nigga

Stay with the heat, D-Wade on a nigga
Hop up out the whip, catch a fade with a nigga, oh Lord

That's cause we come from them trenches
No we can't fuck with them snitches
Tippin' on fours, OHB all with the business

[Chorus]
I wanna see you girl

Go 'head and be you girl
Can't wait to see you girl

[Verse]
I haven't seen you in a while, you know I miss you babe
When you hear this song, feel flattered, it's about your face
And how I miss it and I wish that I could see it more
But you're in college now and I'm about to go on tour

[Chorus]
I wanna see you girl
I wanna please you girl
Go 'head and be you girl
Can't wait to see you girl
I wanna

[Intro]
Yeah, yo we're (?)
I'm drunk as a fool

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Shit change, bitches change, niggas change
We never change, we never change
Shit change, bitches change, niggas change
We never change, we never change

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
No, usually I don't do this but
I roll a joint so I get through to ya
Get hella high about my paper though
Come pick you up and we go out to Clippers not the Lakers
Balling brings a lot of haters
A bar stay on me, a lot of favors
A lot of favors, roll that weed, we get them skyscrapers
What we doin' with our time?
Gettin' fly, finding classic whips to buy
Bigger fish to fry
One of y'all you can see it in my eyes
Money long, you can tell by what I just put in my ride
When you won niggas wish for you demise
Nothin' wrong, we can see through your disguise, 09

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Shit change, bitches change, niggas change
We never change, we never change
Shit change, bitches change, niggas change
We never change, we never change

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Niggas is shape shiftin', transformers on us
Jealous of position, envious of performance
I'm forever on it
Known for cookin' audio dope and gettin' off it
Pots under the faucet
The right temperature, we toss it
You want that work, you gotta come and see the bosses
First tuck in your shirt cut that fuckin' nonsense
When in Rome do as the Romans
You wouldn't know because you never goin'
A lot of niggas doin' hella ho shit
And not notice
Motherfuckers know that I'm not for it
You'll be extorted
We came for the paper, cake slices, large portions
Race Porsches to California by the mornin'

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Shit change, bitches change, niggas change
We never change, we never change
Shit change, bitches change, niggas change
We never change, we never change

[Intro: T-Pain]
Oooohhh, yeah yeah
Woo! yeah yeah
T-T-T-T-Tmix, baby
Pizzle, Woo!
Look at it
I mean this shit can't be against the rules now
I fuck with these niggas
Get the nigga who did Desiigner adlibs, get him on the phone because this shit about to be lit

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Leggo
Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda
I got hoes up in Brooklyn, my Jamaican bitches be cooking
She sit me down at the table, I let you know how it was looking
Rice and peas, macaroni cheese, collared greens
No she don't bullshit
She Steph Curry with the curry chicken
She just make a whole bunch of good shit
I been out the ghost, I got the rice sitting on the tow truck
Had to hit me with some bands
He can get me that brown paper bag
Get me more bucks
I'm goin fine, securing lines with my zoes bro down in Florida
I stack it, stack it, pack it, pack it, stack it, pack it, stack it, pack it, in that order
Hold up, I'm all the way up
I need to put something in my soda
I don't need no lunch, Ima go get a bunch of Asian bitches up in the Rover
My legacy, fuck that
They thought that T-pain wasn't gon' to come back
Now go tell them that when you run back
You a hoe, so you already done that
Hold up, I'm all the way up
I need to put something in my Sprite, bitch
If you think you're doing it, I'm about to ruin it
You're niggas are going to learn tonight, bitch
If you think I'm lit now, watch what happens when I come and turn on the light switch
I will not plan this shit, I come and handle it
Boy that ain't shit but a flight, bitch

[Bridge: T-Pain]
I mean really though
If you think about it, really think about it how hard do they really go?
(Bitch, I'm really dope)
Now you really know
They ain't ready bro
Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
I got bitches in the Bronx, nigga
They can get me in the back door
Rob a nigga in the trap house, bitch you just walked in the trap door
Cross the body in the Bugatti, go put the bricks in the wrapper
Thought they was sleepin on Pizzle
Somebody go ask these niggas what they takin' a nap for
Illuminappy, that the squad, nigga
Without that shit I would've been dead
But I swear to God I'ma keep killin' niggas and I put that shit on my kid's head
Cash Know. I'm an asshole. So don't fuck with Pizzle and his bread
I’m the type of nigga that’ll fight a nigga then go find his chick and give that bitch head
Yea, I'm all the way up
¿Dónde estás, mi amigo?
Don't put your eye in that peephole
'Cause I'll turn the back of your head to a peephole
Then kick in the door and murk all your people
You already know the weapon is lethal
Flip the clip, cock it back, pull the hair trigger
Yeah nigga, back for the sequel, oh
I got problems in my head, nigga
Smokin' that shit from the West Coast
The major key is when you hatin' me, you could fuck around get your neck broke
You fuck around with the Winsquad, they could find your body at the Texaco
The summer comin' and you comin' with nothin'
You ready pussy-nigga, let's go

[Bridge: T-Pain]
All I say is "Panda, Panda" and they handle-handle my shit
While I'm chillin' up in Alabama tryna show a bitch how fast a lambo can get
With all of this green up under these gold chains, they mistakin' me for the king
Bitch, I make platinum, I'm comin' after them
Passin' them, all I do is fucking win, bitch

[Verse 3: Young Cash, T-Pain, Together]
I got broads out in Cali, I got hoes gettin' ratchet
Hit dispensaries and grab it, wrap it all up in that plastic
USPS, I'm a track it
Two day priority, I have it
They’re making ‘em meet and I'm taxin'
Two hundred racks in the mattress
I don't know about y'all, but I'm a street nigga
Ain't gotta sound like nobody, I'm just me, nigga
Been on tour with T-Pain, that's for free, nigga
That's why I still fuck with them bricks and the weed, nigga
And that's why I hop in my jag, my nigga go hop in that Benz
My nigga go hop in that porsche, and no we don't need no new friends
'Cause we'll go hop in that ghost, and yeah that we'll still got the Benz
Look at that lift on the fours, look at the mothafuckin' rims
And I keep tryna tell you we from Florida, babe
Still fifty-grand sofa, now mercedes benz
The baddest bitches in the world that'll drive you crazy
From the cocaine era, I'm a eighties-baby
Oh yeah

[Outro: Desiigner]
Panda, Panda
Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda, Panda
Panda, Panda, Panda

Ahh, uhh
I'm not even gonna say rest in peace because it’s bigger than death. I never met the man (I was too nervous the one time I saw him) and I never saw him play live, regrettably, I only know the legends I’ve heard from folks and what I’ve heard and seen from his deep catalog of propellant, fearless, virtuosic work.

My assessment is that he learned early on how little value to assign to someone else’s opinion of you.. an infectious sentiment that seemed soaked into his clothes, his hair, his walk, his guitar and his primal scream. He wrote my favorite song of all time, "when you were mine". It’s a simple song with a simple melody that makes you wish you thought of it first, even though you never would have - a flirtatious brand of genius that feels approachable.

He was a straight black man who played his first televised set in bikini bottoms and knee high heeled boots, epic. He made me feel more comfortable with how I identify sexually simply by his display of freedom from and irreverence for obviously archaic ideas like gender conformity etc. He moved me to be more daring and intuitive with my own work by his demonstration - his denial of the prevailing model...his fight for his intellectual property - ‘slave’ written across the forehead, name changed to a symbol... an all out rebellion against exploitation.

A vanguard and genius by every metric I know of who affected many in a way that will outrun oblivion for a long while. I’m proud to be a Prince fan(stan) for life.

[Intro]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Yeah
Whoa

[Verse 1]
Look at me
Tell me what you see
The back and forth of an earthquake goes strong and sturdy tree
I ask myself this question, but it's still a mystery
How I'm gonna keep my balance when I
Look at you?

[Verse 2]
How can you not know
Standing over there like a Nefertiti, or the queen, Dido
Please don't think too ill of me
It's all that I can do (It's all that i can do)
Not to feel myself when I
Look at you

[Verse 3]
Modesty aside, whoever made you should be praised
(Yes)
Ain't no need to hide, every glass should be raised
Brandy or martini
Kudos overdue
What else is there really when I
Look at you?

[Verse 4]
Fight it, yes, my soul has tried
When you look at me
All other women just roll their eyes
But even Ray Charles can see you
Stevie Wonder can too
Thoughts well up and wonder
Thinking about me and you
(A dozen fantasies)
A dozen fantasies you
Call me one and done
When you look at me
(Look at you, look at me)

[Verse 1]
Every man that meets her wants to give her his name
She’s too hot for words and too wise to tame
She’s got knee-high boots and e-o-lectric hair
She's born to be a rock star I swear
She’s got nine lives with a couple more to spare

[Refrain]
Old enough to do ya
But too young to dare

[Verse 2]
She got a kick drum brain full o’ technology
But just enough old school to know where the party be
She talks about the top as if she’s always been there
Like a member of the "chosen few rarified heirs"
Her legs so long she never climbs stairs

[Refrain]
She's old enough to do ya
But too young to dare

[Chorus]
Too young too young to dare
Too young too young to dare
(Yeah)
Too young too young to dare
Too young too young to dare

[Verse 3]
Too fine for "Idol"
Too smart for "The X-Factor"
Internet beauty
Everybody wanna hack her
The world can only wonder right up until
They hear the juicy gossip that’s in her will
'Til then we can just pretend that she’s

[Outro]
Old enough to do ya
Old enough to do ya
Old enough to do ya
But she’s just too young to dare
Too young to dare
Too young to dare
Too young to dare
Too young to dare

[Intro]
When she comes
When she
When she comes

[Verse 1]
When she comes
Always unexpected
But never rejected surprise
It’s always a shock
When he undoes the lock
And then she’s there without a care
When she comes

[Verse 2]
When she comes
The house is always a mess
She’s cool nevertheless and here’s why, here's why
She remains as we say
A sweet bird of prey
She flies
And she’s satisfied
When she comes

[Verse 3]
A lemoncello ballet
A psychedelic cabaret in his mind
(Oh, in his mind)
Without further adieu
He takes off her shoes
And whatever confines
When she comes

[Verse 4]
When she comes
A blue bed of roses she never closes her eyes
For his artful technique
Deserves a peek
Call it sublime
'Cause it happens when she happens

[Verse 5]
So oh sweet the taste
The tears that roll down her face
Don’t cry
Oh, they don't cry
Though sad first site
They are filled with delight
The Fourth of July
When she comes
Oh when she
When she
(Comes)
Black Muse

[Verse 1]
Black Muse can I talk to you
What I got to share is mighty good news
A brand new day is dawning
But you and me know what to do
(So much work to do)

[Verse 2]
Black Muse we've been so abused
Our mothers were good-looking and our fathers were too
But if they don't stay together
We can't walk no better in these shoes
(Black Muse)

[Chorus]
Long ago two men held one of us down
Another took a whip and made a terrible sound
Baby watched her father falling down to the ground
That was you and me

[Verse 3]
Black Muse can I share with you
Just came this morning and it's mighty good news
They tipped the hour glass
Now everything is passed
It's true

[Chorus]
They gave the world back to you and me
The faces on the mountains and a dirty sea
A trillion dollar bill and no currency
Still we believe

[Verse 4]
Black Muse we gonna make it through
Surly people that created rhythm and blues
Rock and roll and jazz
So you know we're built to last
It's cool, it's cool, it's cool
(Black Muse)

[Outro]
A new day is dawning
Black Muse
A new day is dawning
Black Muse
1000 Lightyears Away

Now that I got your attention
I think it's 'bout time I mention
The reason why I wrote this song
Like a UFO sighting
From my heart I am writing
The next close encounter
Tell me how long
Will it be on land or near the water
Will it produce the sun or the black moon daughter
Or a pillow covered with all our tears
One thousand light years away from here
(One thousand light years away from here)
One thousand light years away from here
(One thousand light years away from here)

No yesterday or tomorrow
No better remedy for sorrow
Or why the fifth held forever will make you cry
I don't know why
One thousand light years away from here
(One thousand light years away from here)

Two unbroken circles joined together make a butterfly
Little darling don't you wanna try?
There ain't nothing better than looking for me
And seeing you
Seeing you in the mirror
One thousand light years away from here
Why do we always seem so far away?
When you know that I really wanna be with you night and day
I'm running out of ways to say how
So I think I'll just close
For now

[Verse 1]
You, you turn gold to dust now
What was trust is lost now
What is all this darkness you have inside?
I just can't ignore it
From my heart, what's pouring
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, it's the last time
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Check it with a flashlight
It's the last night you'll get up on it
If you wanna save it, ooh
Better shoot straight like a laser, ooh
I ain't waiting for you, you

[Chorus]
Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh?
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

[Verse 2]
Boom, barrel, love, a gun, pow
I'll be on the run now
Can't take no more bullets through my wounds
I just can't ignore it
From my heart, what's pouring
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, it's the last time
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Check it with a flashlight
It's the last night you'll get up on it
If you wanna save it, ooh
Better shoot straight like a laser, ooh
I ain't waiting for you, you

[Chorus]
Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh?
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

[Bridge]
So watch it blow when I let it go
When I cut this rope and run, run
By the time you wake, it'll be too late
Now the bullet's left the gun, yeah

[Chorus]
Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh?
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

[Chorus]
I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
But I don't care even if I was a fool

[Verse 1]
Still in love with you
Had I listened to the grape vine
I might have had my doubts
But I tried my level best just to block them out

'Cause love is so unwise
Love has no eyes
It took a while for a fool to see what his friends were on about

[Chorus]
I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
But I don't care even if I was a fool

[Bridge 1]
Still in love with you
Imagining your face
It almost fills the empty space before me
I can see your eyes, almost hear your lovely lies

[Verse 2]
I wish I was an old man
Love was through with me
I wish I was a baby on my mama's knee
I wish I was a freight train moving down the line
Just to keep in track of time
Without all these memories

[Chorus]
I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
And I don't care even if I was a fool

[Bridge 2]
Still in love with you, baby yes I am
I could've opened my eyes
Could've seen through your lies
Could've stood for no more
Could've walked out the door

[Chorus]
I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care
I was a fool to care

[Outro]
(I was a fool) You were nothing but a fool to care
(I was a fool) Just a country fool to care
(I was a fool) You were nothing but a fool to care
(I was a fool) Just a country fool to care
(I was a fool) You were nothing but a fool to care
(I was a fool) Just a country fool to care
(I was a fool) You were nothing but a fool to care
(I was a fool) Just a country fool to care
(I was a fool) You were nothing but a fool to care

[Intro: Teacher]
Stop running in the halls! Stop! Slow down, sir! Slow down, sir! Stop running in the halls, sir! Anthony get to class! You're never going to become a college student at that rate!

[Hook]
Fuckin' science
Fu-fuckin' science, bro
Labcoat, check, goggles, check
Nodules, check
Fu-fu-fu-fu-fuckin' science, bro

[Verse 1: B.o.B + Teacher]
Hi-yah lads! Welcome to science class
Bob quit writin' raps in your log sheet, nobody's gon' sign your ass
Okay let's get scientific
Fossil fuels come from years and years of bio-decomposition
It's really just scientific
Why didn't all the fossils turn to oil?
Some did, some didn't
Anyway...
Didn't Rockerfeller pay the scientists off the year of the Geneva Convention?
Wait? What was that?
You wanna come up here in front of class?
What? You wanna teach?
You really think you're smarter than me?
No sir, sit down
Here's your homework on the atom bomb and the World War
How it affected us then and now
Well uh... I seen the footage and uh, I really just want some answers
How does someone film an atomic bomb and it doesn't destroy the camera?
I mean...
I was just...
BRO!
Bro, I'm just sayin'... I don't know

[Hook: B.o.B]
Fu-fuckin' science, bro
Labcoat, check, goggles, check
Nodules, check
Fu-fu-fu-fu-fuckin' science, bro

[Verse 2: B.o.B + Teacher]
Welcome to history, we evolved from neanderthalsThat is no mystery!
Well why are there no monkey fossils anywhere?
What, are you kidding me!?
I'm just sayin'... I just
Shoulda learned that way back in elementary
Man this nigga don't know what the fuck he talkin' about
I have a diploma, do you have a diploma?
Or a learning disorder?
My wife is a lawyer, we both have a daughter
She's doin' fine with the things that we taught her
Yeah I'm just usin' the scientific method
Did we evolve from electronical boy or homo erectus?
And all of the fossilized footprints in the fossil records
Don't show a line of thrust, that's not consistent with compression
What the fuck did he just say??
Yeah, okay smartass
This is real knowledge, save all that hippie shit for art class
It's really startin' to bug me on this one
Gonna have to trust me on this one
I have done the studies on this one
You're a little rusty on this one
I mean why can't you just answer my question on the subject?
It's not in the fuckin' book
It's not up for discussion

[Hook: B.o.B]
Science, I fuckin' love science!
I fuckin' love science!
I love science
Labcoat, check, goggles, check
Nodules, check
Fu-fu-fu-fu-fuckin' science, bro

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Damn, must have been a hell of them stegosauruses
Over a century burnin' fossil fuels, still ain't no shortages
I ain't sayin' I'm Neo, but I'm nothin' short of a morpheus
Fuck, thought this was a globe, I gotta check my coordinates
You can blame my disorderly conduct on my subordinance
If it ain't no Coriolis who's to blame for New Orleans?
Why the poorest people always get extorted by corporate giants
We don't boycott, we buy in and I find it unfortunate, yeah
Me plus you plus her plus her, that's four (Math!)
Bring your worst and I'm gon' bring much more
Leave your nerves, your skirt, both at the door
In case you didn't know

[Hook: B.o.B + Scientist]
Fuckin' science bro!
Well Earth shine is much brighter than moonshine
Fu-fuckin' science, bro
Labcoat, check (moonshine)
Goggles, check (moonshine)
Nodules, check (moonshine)
Fuckin' (moonshine)

[Verse 4: B.o.B.]
How many fingers am I holdin' up?
Come and compete him if you're bold enough
No Bobby Ray don't give an ounce of fuck
Your team is weak, you beat your bouncer up

[Outro: Teacher + Neil deGrasse Tyson]
Student loans await you all! God I hate my life. Hey you! You! Stop making out! I know your mother, Susan! I'm gonna tell Susan about this! Debrah! Is that coke???

I'm Neil deGrasse Tyson, bitch!

[Intro]
Alright you Polaroids, let's go!
Mhh we're in the big city
Uh, come on!

[Chorus]
Where ever we are it's a big city
Dirty little hotel room or working on a farm
If everybody is a star, to me, you're the most pretty
I'm in the big city, the big city, the big city
When I'm in your arms

[Verse 1]
Bright Lights, a sea of faces
Something tells me this is gonna be fun
Tonight's the night
And of all the places
That I'm going to fall in love, it's got to be this one
There'll never be anybody happier than this
Let's make a vow and seal it with a kiss
(Uh, yeah)

[Chorus]
Where ever we are it's a big city
Dirty little hotel room or working on a farm
If everybody is a star, to me, you're the most pretty
I'm in the big city, the big city, the big city
When I'm in your arms

[Verse 2]
It's our time - we're in the line for the big break
Everything is looking up when you're this low to the ground
It's bout time
Everybody's on the take
Let's get a big brush and paint this town
The night is young...
Much younger than we are
Let's kiss the night
Away in a fast car

[Chorus]
Where ever we are it's a big city
Dirty little hotel room or working on a farm
If everybody is a star, to me, you're the most pretty
I'm in the big city (and me), the big city, the big city
When I'm in your arms

[Verse 3]
Everybody's getting money instead of getting saved
Not you and me honey we already gave
Just as long as eye got you don't care come what may...
(Well she's in the big city)
I just came to tell y'all
From the darkest desperation to the highest bliss
Power to the one's aware of the bigger than this!
Big city uh, where's my guitar?
What's going on? Everything good

[Chorus]
Where ever we are it's a big city
Dirty little hotel room or working on a farm
If everybody is a star, to me, you're the most pretty
I'm in the big city, the big city, the big city
When I'm in your arms

[Outro]
The big city so pretty
Oh yeah
Taking back the lane give it to the next man, plane
Foxy and you what you wanna do?
That's it

[Intro]
Revelation
Revelation

[Verse 1]
It's coming back to me now
You and I were meant to be together, and how
(Revelation)
(Revelation)

[Verse 2]
It seems like you've always been here
Now that you are, stay with me forever my dear
(Revelation)
(Revelation)

[Verse 3]
If ever (If ever), there was ever
Such a thing as time, ooh baby
It's useless, so useless to me now
For in your arms is everything, in your arms, everything

[Verse 4]
An army of haters, one by one
Will do what they will to everyone
But the task at hand until we see the sun
Is to keep doing you until you come to revelation
(Revelation)
(Revelation)
Revelation, oooh oh
(Can I play with it now?)

[Guitar Solo]
(Can I, can I play with it now?)
Ooh

[Verse 5]
It's all coming back to me now
Like it was deep in the ocean
I beat my sword into a plow (Sword into a plow)
And shared a heavenly potion (Heavenly potion)
With my future queen
Half east, half west, the truth's somewhere best in between

[Outro]
Through English glamour, casting a spell
Through Hebrew, Greek, and Roman hell
Higher 'til we overstand, the color of the Pharoah's hand
(The color of the Pharaoh's hand)

[Intro]
All you can hear is the sound of my voice
Every time I touch your face
You gonna fall into a deep sleep
A deep sleep
A deep sleep

[Verse 1]
You are the reason I believe that I was born
You're always there tp hold me whenever I am scorned
I'd give my left hand just to know your name
Shall I call you "Savior" just the same?

[Chorus]
Hypnoparadise, oh-oh-oh
Hypnoparadise, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Am I in Heaven or Hypnoparadise?
This must be heaven 'cause Hell was never nice
I don't need permission to be happy every day
As long as I got a freak like you, I'm straight

[Chorus]
Hypnoparadise, oh-oh-oh
Hypnoparadise, oh-oh-oh
Oh paradise

[Verse 3]
Touch me I'll go under any spell you choose
I don't mind the loss, my dear, when it comes to you, I'd lose
I can dig them all to be wrong as long as you're all right
This is my destiny: hypnoparadise
Paradise (So nice)

[Chorus]
Hypnoparadise, oh-oh-oh
(Oh yes)
Hypnoparadise, oh-oh-oh
(Say you wanna get it on)
Hypnoparadise, oh-oh-oh
(Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, yeah yeah yeah)
Hypnoparadise, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3]
You are the reason that I was born
You're always there baby when I am scorned
I'd give my left hand, just to know your name
My Savior, every day, yeah ooh

[Chorus]
Hypnoparadise, oh-oh-oh

[Intro]
*Phone rings*
Hello?
Hi, it's me, can I come over?

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I want a shot of your Novocaine
I think I found the switch that turns off the brain
Locate the black hole that I can jump right through

[Interlude]
'Cause my ears, they won't stop ringing
I won't stand another pick up line
Oh, my heart, it will stop beating
If I don't see you tonight

[Chorus]
I'm throwing down some drinks, and then speed dialin'
I think I'm gonna wake you up
I stutter when I speak, but I'm not lying
I think I want you way too much
These things I confess, they just lead to a dysfunctional love
Just don't hang up
Just, just don't hang up

[Verse 2]
Running away is not the solution
My head's not straight with all this pollution
Electronic gadgets add to the confusion

[Interlude]
So, are you on your own?
Or should I take a rain check?
Now am I going home?
Or will I cry my eyes out?

[Chorus]
I'm throwing down some drinks, and then speed dialin'
I think I'm gonna wake you up
I stutter when I speak, but I'm not lying
I think I want you way too much
These things I confess, they just lead to a dysfunctional love
Don't hang up

[Bridge]
There wouldn't be so much to say
If I wasn't in this all to stay
Is it too late
For us to communicate?

[Break]
I, I, I, speed dialin'
I, I, I, speed dialin'

[Chorus]
I'm throwing down some drinks, and then speed dialin'
I think I'm gonna wake you up
I stutter when I speak, but I'm not lying
I think I want you way too much

[Outro]
Don't hang up
'Cause I want you way too much
Out of luck
Because you're too far for me to touch
Don't hang up
Because I need you way too much

[Verse 1]
You probably could have make it work in the past life
Said vows, I make you the first and last wife
A rich Nigga thats certain to hit the ass right
Make a broke bitch smile like a low gas price
Truthfully I was digging your little style
Kept your hills on, I'm hitting you all wild
Poker chips and Vegas dinners,...
We trying Minaj later, so you pick a girl out
I look at you and see a different girl, now
Getting Whitley with me, a different world now
A good girl, then I turn you into a bad bitch
Constipated ass you ain't never had shit
I'm so over your head, you shoulda caught that
Fucking with my phones
When I'm gone, like you bought that
I was fucking with you heavy, but I'm bachelor
Money is my only girl, no lie, relaxer

[Chorus]
Can't fuck with you no more
I just can't fuck, just can't fuck with you no more
Fucking with you is bad for my health!
Fuck with you no more
I just can't fuck, just can't fuck with you no more
Fucking with you is bad for my health
Fucking with you is bad for my health!

[Verse 2]
Crazy with the head, but she crazy in head
Attract a lot of birds cause I make a lot of bread
Searching for my dove, hoping love is forgiven
And I find that a dove ain't nothing but a pigeon
Y'all know, I ain't nothing but a player
Guess is value that make them wanna value
Can't blame you for wanting something major
Shout out to the broads, like can I get a Laker?
Really women don't you be embarrassed by the fakers
Yves Saint Laurent is probably flattered by the bakers
Moments couldn't flatter being madder at the haters
How dare you dislike me when I know I am the greatest
But now I see the beauty when they try to subdue me
All on my balls see the blogs is the groupies
But that's the part of my movie
Deep down I know you are happy you ever knew me

[Chorus]

[B.o.B]
Born into competition
With a feeling that something's missing
Bred in a corn addiction
With a synthetic composition
On the brink of a civil war
Or the forming of one religion?
I wonder what came first
Dinosaurs or Darwinism?
Pledging allegiance to a flag
Since elementary
Writing curses in cursive and casting spells
Stung by the spelling bee
And they says congratulations
You graduated
From slavery
To paid slavery
You actually made it!
Here! Take this gown and cap and wave it
Like a celebration of going to school just to get a job to pay for it
Like a nation that traded it's minerals in exchange for paper payment
Here, these are your gods, you have to praise 'em
I wonder who we'd worship if we weren't captured and traded
Consider this my affidavit
Yo, It's the ruling class
Here to rule yo ass
Prescription drug thug cocaine mule yo ass
Agricultural skills sure would suit yo ass
But they say, living off the land is a useless path
Here, work for dead Presidents, HA! fooled yo ass
Any revolutionaries, they remove yo ass
Fast, click clack, quick blast, in a flash
Whiplash from the kickback of the impact
Push yo shit back
As long as my head is intact
I'll be as political as I want
Because I get taxed
Nah, this ain't no fuckin diss track, to distract
Or useless chit chat, or syntax, or
Who's ass is this fat and who has a six pack
Who's batting this average, or
Compare his passes to his passes
There's a thousand sports channels
You can get this package, or this package
Who's this savage?
Hey, let's compare your emotional baggage to my emotional baggage
And see who calls each other bitch fastest
Haters go out they way to fuck up my day
But I ain't even worried about your bitch asses
And it's quite the optic, hard to take your eyes off it
They make the sky toxic
Prescribe the antibiotic
Make a high profit, divide the margin
You could die off it
If you do, they hide the autopsy
What the fuck are you supposed to do?
Morgellons in your kosher food
What the fuck is even kosher food?
Third generation crops won't produce
Be careful who you keep close to you
I'm from Atlanta, but shots out to my Oakland crew
They say, "Bobby Ray, the older you is overdue"
I say hey, sorry I got a little caught up exposing truths
I used to think, what would Hova do?
Now I think, what the fuck would Macho Man and Hulk Hogan do?
Now, if Steve Austin was America, and the Rock was Afghanistan
Then Russia and China would be Triple HHH
And the Illuminati would be Vince Macmahon
Now when the haters are The Undertaker
The crowd doesn't stand a chance
When the international bankers are walking through the stands
Slide yo ass some Xan
You think you a fan but you really just a lamb
Niggas start trends every day but don't never get no pair of Vans
What the fuck is an advance?
Niggas live on colored people time
What the fuck is in advance?
Tsh, I don't fucking understand
I just want my fucking bandz
I'm a walking talking human conundrum
Like a Muslim going HAM
Looking for the promised land
False stories of Christopher Columbus
Holding Pocahontas' hand
Black History is the shortest month
I just hope you understand, when the
Native Indians don't get shit but
Thanksgiving and some yams, like
Here, here's a few casinos, huhh, sorry we took all your land, huhh
Well, let's just move on, because, America's great!
Man I fucking love it
Democratic or Republic
Lightning rod, change the subject
All of these religions, I'm glad I found one
All of these beliefs and mine's the right one
Trying to process all this info you hide from
Till you wake the fuck up out on the advice son
Culture and religion condition your mind hon'
Whatever's prohibited, imma defy them
The smell of freedom is making my eyes run
To authority, i'm the antithesis
I'm not a pacifist, or a philantropisist
I don't got all the answersises
I just got a louder mic, and better stanzasas, bitch
Oh i'm sorry, did I offend you?
What the fuck you think goes on in schools you send your kids to?
What the fuck you think they serve for lunch, what's on the menu?
That's why only ratchet shit is what these kids is into
A language comprehendable
Friends do what they friends do
People act so fucking hard but really they just gentle
Psychological children
Grownups with issues
Grownups with children
Who grow up with issues
Cancer tissues
Abandonment,  misuse
Subliminal marketing screaming, "Here, let me fix you
I have the cure
I have the remedy
I am the savior
I am not the enemy
But give me your money, give me your money, give me your money!"
Everybody's in debt
But this is a free country!
They dock your pay, what a mockery
Why you on the clock
Hickory, dickory, dockery
They want cable, they want coffee, they want comedy
Anything to take they mind off being property
Trying to say it properly
Working on my tact
But I am the anomaly
They know i'm the shit like a elio-colonoscopy
They know i'm the shit by just looking at my discography
They know i've been sent to awake this idiocracy
Mass media, hipocrisy
Turn you into a worker bee
Harvest the honey tree
I'm just being honest, b
Mother Earth quakes underneath
Father Sky, up above the sea
God the father, the sky
Son of God, the Sun
Amun Ra, the Eye
No more Amen
No more folding hands goodbye
Adios, au revoir, bandz

[Verse 1]
Uh, break the breaker, win it
Can you hear me loud and clear?
He's got your heart but you want mine
You need to be over here
The further you get away, every word that I had to say
Seems like you want to disappear
And I heard that you leaving, I can't believe it
It's officially turned into a search and rescue
Wherever you are, whatever I gotta do to get you
My heart is beating so hard
You can hear it go boom boom boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom boom boom

[Chorus]
Girl stop it, you break me up like a walkie talkie
Hello, hello, where did you go?
Yeah, you break me up like a walkie talkie
Come in, come in, where you been?
Yeah, you break me up like a walkie talkie
Break up, break up, one liner
I been tryna find her like
Yeah, you break me up like a walkie talkie
Hello, hello, where did you go?
Yeah, you break me up like a walkie talkie
If this what you truly want

Her hair over mine

Her teeth as confetti

Suck on my balls, pause, I had enough (Sorry, I ain't sorry)

[Verse 2]
Now you wanna say you're sorry
Now you wanna call me crying
Now you gotta see me wilding
Now I'm the one that's lying
And I don't feel bad about it
It's exactly what you get
Stop interrupting my grinding
(You interrupting my grinding)
I ain't thinking 'bout you

[Chorus]
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't thinking 'bout you
I ain't thinking 'bout you
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't thinking 'bout you
I ain't thinking 'bout you

[Pre-Chorus]

Wave it in his face, tell him, boy, bye (Bye) (Sorry, I ain't sorry)
Tell him, boy, bye (Bye), boy, bye (Bye)
Middle fingers up, I ain't thinking 'bout you

No, no, hell nah

[Bridge]
Looking at my watch, he shoulda been home
Today, I regret the night I put that ring on
He always got them fucking excuses
I pray to the Lord you reveal what his truth is

[Outro]
I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 1]
Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

[Refrain]
What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 2]
Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you

You let this good love go to waste

I hop up out my bed and get my swag on

What's up, what's up, what's up
I hop up out my bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up
I tried to change
Closed my mouth more
Tried to be soft, prettier
Less... awake
Fasted for 60 days
Wore white
Abstained from mirrors
Abstained from sex
Slowly did not speak another word
And that time my hair I grew past my ankles
I slept on a mat on the floor
I swallowed a sword
I levitated
Into the basement
Confessed my sins
And was baptized in a river
Got on my knees and said, "Amen"
And said, "I mean"
I whipped my own back
And asked for dominion at your feet
I threw myself into a volcano
I drank the blood and drank the wine
I sat alone and begged and bent at the waist for God
I crossed myself in thought
I saw the devil
I grew thickened skin on my feet
I bathed in bleach
And plugged my menses with the pages from the holy book
But still inside me coiled deep was the need to know
Are you cheating?
Are you cheating on me?

Lord, forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through your shallow love
Tell the deep I'm new

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away," oh
May the last one burn into flames

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
'Cause I need freedom, too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice
Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards
Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights wavin' in my direction (Come on)
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me, like yeah
Open correctional gates in higher desert (Yeah)
Open our mind as we cast away oppression (Yeah)
Open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
'Cause I need freedom, too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh, father, can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh, father, can you hear me?
Hear me out

[Spoken: Hattie White]
I had my ups and downs, but I always find the inner strength to pull myself up. I was served lemons, but I made lemonade.

[Intro]
Yee-haw
Ooh
Texas, Texas (Ooh) Texas

[Verse 1]
Came into this world, daddy's little girl
And Daddy made a soldier out of me (Ooh)
Daddy made me dance and Daddy held my hand (Ooh)
And Daddy liked his whiskey with his tea

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And we rode motorcycles
Blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be
He said, "Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister"
And oh, that's when he gave to me

[Chorus]
With his gun and his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone, "Here's what you do
When trouble comes in town and men like me come around"
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Yee, woo
Ooh
Yee-haw (Woo)

[Verse 2]
Daddy made me fight, it wasn't always right
But he said, "Girl, it's your second amendment" (Ooh)
He always played it cool, but Daddy was no fool
And right before he died, he said, "Remember..."

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He said, "Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister"
That's when Daddy looked at me

[Chorus]
With his gun, with his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot (Yee)
Oh, my daddy said shoot (Yee-haw)
'Cause he held me in his arms and he taught me to be strong
And he told me when he's gone, "Here's what you do
When trouble comes in town and men like me come around"
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot (Woo)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh (Woo)
Ooh (Woo)
Ooh (Yee)
Ooh (Yee-haw)

[Outro: Beyoncé & Blue Ivy Carter]
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said, "Baby girl, he's playing you, he's playing you" (Ooh)
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said, "Baby girl, he's playing you, he's playing you (Ooh)
'Cause when trouble comes in town and men like me come around"
Oh, my daddy said shoot (Yee)
Oh, my daddy said shoot (Yee-haw)
"'Cause when trouble comes to town and men like me come around"
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
(Good job, Bey)

[Verse 1]
Ten times out of nine, I know you're lying
But nine times out of ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm

[Chorus]
'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

[Verse 2]
Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed, I'm movin' on
I always been committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad
But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me
If I wasn't B, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, them old bitches so wack
I'm so tough, wassup?

[Chorus]
'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
And you, you, you, you and me will stop this love drought

[Outro]
You, you, you, you and me will stop this love drought
You, you, you, you and me will stop this love drought

[Verse 1]
I found the truth beneath your lies
And true love never has to hide
True love never has to hide
I'll trade your broken wings for mine
Trade your broken wings for mine
I've seen your scars and kissed your crime, oh
Seen your scars and kissed your crime

[Pre-Chorus]
So many people that I know, they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

[Chorus]
All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

[Verse 2]
Our love was stronger than your pride
Beyond your darkness, I'm your light, oh
If you get deep, you touch my mind
If you get deep, you touch my mind
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes, oh
Baptize your tears and dry your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

[Chorus]
All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

[Bridge]
They say true love's the greatest weapon
To win the war caused by pain, pain
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away
Boy, nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became my remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

[Chorus]
All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

[Outro]
How I missed you, my love

[Verse 1]
We built sandcastles that washed away
I made you cry when I walked away, oh
And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, oh, babe
Every promise don't work out that way

[Verse 2]
Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?
When every promise don't work out that way, no, no, babe
When every promise don't work out that way

[Verse 3]
And your heart is broken 'cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away, oh
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no, no, no, no, no
Every promise don't work out that way

[Verse: James Blake, James Blake & Beyoncé]
Forward
Best foot first just in case
When we made our way 'til now
It's time to listen, it's time to fight
Forward
Now we're going to hold doors open for a while
Now we can be open for a while
Forward
I love you more than this job, please don't work for me
Forward
Go back to your sleep in your favorite spot just next to me
Forward, ooh, forward

[Outro]
Forward, forward

In the beginning, God created Heaven and Earth
For what it's worth, I think that He might've created you first
Just my opinion
Your body is the one paradise that I wanna fly to
Every day and every night

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah

[Chorus]
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

[Verse 2]
Don't matter what's written
We can start all over again, all over again
Oh, how can I get you all over my skin?
My deep intuition tells me that I'm doing you wrong
If I don't come home
Just say you forgive me and don't let me go

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize

My body works, I know
It's just the same, I know
My only difference
Is robot influence

[Post-Chorus 1]
I'm up here for the weirdo swarm
I'm the door when you come for more

[Bridge]
One, two, three!

[Verse 2]
Limber up
Time is up
Fuck shit up
Don't forget about it
My coffin's all I see
Lately
Robot stop

[Chorus]
My body's overworked
It's just the same I know
When can my body work
Cold static overload?
My body works, I know
It's just the same, I know
My only difference
Is robot influence

[Post-Chorus 2]
Upload me to the robot brain
I'm the drudge that goes again and again
Oh!
Bring the spooks to the beer-soaked glade
The robot's here if the robot's paid
Oh!

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
My body's overworked
It's just the same I know
When can my body work
Cold static overload?
My body works, I know
It's just the same, I know
My only difference
Is robot influence

[Post-Chorus 1]
I'm up here for the weirdo swarm
I'm the door when you come for more
Oh!

One, two, three!

Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
HAARP Music

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Change shit change
Is that rain? is that rain?
How strange, how strange
How they spray them clouds with them planes
Deep pain inside of these veins
Deep pain in these veins
How strange, how strange
How they got these fibers, these strangs
Gotta work for a living, not a while
Gotta work for a living, noo I
And I suppose from the highs and lows
Lies are told when in July it snows
Pinocchio can't hide his nose
Anymore than a camel can hide his toe
But who am I? I dont know nothing
I don't know no-ting
How bout I take my rapper thoughts
And go smoke some rapper weed?
They got a co-co-coffin if you sleep, RIP
Then the elite trigger tsunamis using technology

[Verse 2]
Whirl pool
Earth moves, observe the truth of what words do
Words do more than just hurt you
Words alone fill up church pews
Words alone change the outcome
Make you reconsider taking nurse school
Words alone make you pay attention
To the problems that you never worked through
Bird food for the mind
Brain washed over time
Life expectancy on the decline
Vaults up in the sky
I look up and I ask why O Lord?
It's hard to tell what freedom is
When you gotta die for it
And I ain't got that much time to be waiting
Yo, I guess I just ain't got the patience
Uh, Im sick and tired of debating
Yeah, the fuck I look like out here slavin?
You call it complacent but you basic

Quote from Weather Webcast Channel 10
“That is not rain, that is not snow. Believe it or not military aircraft flying through the region is dropping chaff, small bits of aluminum, sometimes it’s made of plastic or even metallicized paper products, but its use is an antiradar issue and obviously they’re up there practicing. Now they won’t confirm that but I was in the Marine Corps for many years, and I’ll tell you right now. That’s what it is.”

[Verse 1]
A Black ass nigga in a red Phantom
I might be ugly, but my car handsome
I might can't dance, but my rims can
Hit the break, urt skrt rims dancin'

A stock Porsche Carrera, I'mma paint it orange
It might be hood, but it's still foreign
I might be rollin' on one of them thangs
A candy painted six, sittin' on them thangs (Gucci!)
Hummer truck or drop top, I got choices
Rims all white, same color forces
Lamb so low, it's like it's snorklin'
My very freaky girl and it's insides are gorgeous

[Hook x2]
My Rims are dancing like a go-go dancer
One's goin' forward and one's goin' backwards
Put your fingers down there'll chop your damn hands up
Gave my rims a tip because they're real good dancers

[Verse 2]
A Black ass nigga in a old school classic
I pulled up to club Gucci Mama doin' the pool palace
And now they doin' the snake and cabbage patchey
Sittin' on davins, watch me spin backwards
My rims are strippers and they dancin' nasty
If you wanna pair, then you know you gotta cash-in
You need a motor run, a new transmission
Homeboy, you're trippin', your car game, is slippin'
This card right here, it doesn't have a limit
Gucci is a trapstar; how did Gucci get it?
A drop Ferrari and it sure ain't rented
Ask me where I bought it from, where other niggas can't get it

[Hook]
My Rims are dancing like a go-go dancer
One's goin' forward and one's goin' backwards
Put your fingers down there'll chop your damn hands up
Gave my rims a tip because they're real good dancers

Radric is a player but Gucci is the mayor (It’s Gucci!)
Shawty fine as hell but she slick as hell
Love the way she walk and I love the way she smells
Shawty says loves me, but I don’t believe her
What about your ex-man? Could have been your husband
What about your boyfriend? Better yet your girlfriend
Girl got a girlfriend, But I don’t have a girlfriend
But I got a bitch tho sitting in my seven four
Ridin through the Six slow hood love me

[Verse 2]
All my bitches love me, my bitch is not ugly
My bitches ain’t dusty, but your bitch is busted
Yo bitch is a buster, my bitch is a hustler
She don’t fuck with suckas, she know you a sucka
You probably know of her, you may even fucked her
She can’t give me nothing but a nut because I’m stuck up
Gucci got a dump truck and he got a hummer
And he painted all of his cars green for the summer
You a freaky gurl but I don’t want your number
(noooooo) I just want that thang beat up just like it’s a drumma
BumBumuBum grab you by your palm Palm
Then I pull out a condom and make her want some (It's Gucci)

[Hook]
All my bitches love me, all my bitches love me

I am very lucky, I think that she loves me (It’s Gucci Baby)

[Verse 3]
Gucci Mane a bachelor, damn you attractive
Looking for the baddest bitch cuz I think I can handle it
My swag is conceited, some bitches can’t stand it
Some over stand it, but some don’t understand it
All my bitches love me, but I’m not romantic
But I love it when they were their dress without the panties
Gucci Mane, I’m madness, don’t you think I’m handsome?
Curling like a Lambo, You handle like a Phantom
Hotter than a candle you trying to get a temper
Can I get a sample? I feel like a need a pamper
So Icey the shit girl, don’t you think we handsome?
Don’t you think we handsome?

How you doing sir?
Hey how you doing?
Good. Real quick man, reason why I stopped you, you know it's a 55, you're doing 91
Uh, I-
What's the hurry man?
I'm taking my girl out on a date tonight
You don't got any more marijuana in the car do you?
Nah
No, you smoke it all?
Yup
Alright, what I'm gonna get you to do, is just uh, don't- don't touch that gun, alright man?
Alright

I don't make the rules
I just break the rules
Best stay in tune
Cause I'm breaking news
I pay my dues
I done paid my dues
Can't tell me shit
Don't know you dudes

[Verse 1]
I'm so Un-Traditional, you so regular, you so basic, you so unoriginal
Not a second go by that I'm not offending you
They say "Bob ain't Hip-Hop" I don't know why, I guess it must be the stage name
Now put me on the track with any M.C., motherfucker know you better bring your A-Game
And they say I need to clean my lyrics, to a child it sounds suggestive
Okay, I do that when the fucking government stops harbouring child molestors
In a time when you could be face down arrested, and get shot if you sound aggressive
And here I go
Trying to break through to the troubled youth but I guess I can't cause your child was sheltered
How protective is too protective
How neglected is too neglected
How every year it's a new Flu Epidemic
How every year it's a new terrorist group with nuclear weapons
Can't be coincidental, orchestrated like an instrumental
If you use your mental, life ain't complicated, this shit is usually simple

[Hook]
I don't make the rules
I just break the rules
Best stay in tune
Cause I'm breaking news
I pay my dues
I done paid my dues
Can't tell me shit
Don't know you dudes

[Verse 2]
Owe you shit? I don't owe you shit
And you know that shit, and you know that shit
I won't Coexist with no bogus bitch
Poof, be gone, Hocus Pocus bitch
Got no time for clown ass niggas
Chatty Patty full of gossip niggas
Word on the street, you a bottom nigga
Old private party illuminati member
Bobby don't give no fucks, oh no
Talk all that shit on the photo, Top all that shit on the timeline
When they see me they still want a photo
I call that free promo
This shit is amazing, this is the awakening
History in the making
They want me to behave but I can't cause I can not be bought
There is not a journey that can not be sought
I plan to embark
Is there light at the end of the ship (?)
How can we evolve?
A nation of children that can not be taught
They say this shit is just cannabis talk, but without it my thoughts are just crammed in a vault

[Hook]
I don't make the rules
I just break the rules
Best stay in tune
Cause I'm breaking news
I pay my dues
I done paid my dues

Nope

Lying to protect you, I be doing that a lot

[Intro]
It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

[Chorus]
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore

[Verse 1]
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now we're meeting our end

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 2]
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A., I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 3]
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all
Like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya; that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that

[Chorus]
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

[Outro: Girl (Spoken)]
Any time people want to start problems
It's like “for real, are you dumb?”
You know who mans are

[Intro]
Dedicate, I dedicate the world
Yeah, oh
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my fortune
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate, oh yeah
I dedicate, I dedicate to you

[Verse 1]
They throwin' dirt on my old name
Only gets worse when you know things
You don't see the perks of this whole thing
But you get real on a pill and I like it
You just like my sidekick, I just wanna ride, fulfill all your desires
Keep you in the front, never in the back and never on the side, uh
(Yeah)

[Chorus 1]
You a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

[Verse 2]
Look, you know I'm a rider, nothin' left to hide
Your other nigga tired
Talk about you like you never leave his side
But I don't really buy it
Me? I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Let's just keep it private (Don't say anything)
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
'Cause we never decided, tell me how you feel inside

[Chorus 2]
You a real ass woman and I like it, yeah
Dedicate to you
I need you inspired, I need you excited
I don't wanna fight it

[Verse 3]
Yeah-yeah, I figure out you, you figure out me
We both a different breed
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
You say, "A guarantee"
I mean, you say that like it's easy
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on 'em
Girl, I'm sleepy
Sometimes I'm so indecisive

[Chorus 1]
But you a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

[Outro]
I give you my fortune
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate, I dedicate
This song's for you
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my voice
This song's for you

[Intro]
Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, man the whole city
Shit's crazy right now, and shit ain't gonna stop
Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better

[Verse 1]
Look, momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more
